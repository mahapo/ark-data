This rare work, sixilar in some respects to the Lecrenda, was ftr~.erC~ available only to Thirty-second Degree Masters cf the Royal Secret. As all these works are ~zw d.~Ificuit to obtain we have decided to inc~ia then in a single handy volume. In Lecrenda of the Lodcre of ?arfectio~ are found but two chapters, “The AEnigma of Hiram,” and “The AEnigma of the Sphynx.” The forDer bears a strong resemblance to a chapter entitled “The Flaming Star” in Eliphas Levi’s p~stunously— published Livre des Splendeurs (1894) , and was likely based on the then unpublished writings in circulation among occultists. In treating the symbolism of the Hiramic legend Pike remarks that the interpretation he provides was “given by an Adept.” As it is now common knowledge that Pike lifted liberally from Levi when compiling Morals and Docrma we should not be surprised to find the same here. Since Levi died in 1875 and Pike in 1891 it is not known how, when or where he obtained the writings. The included descriptions of rituals are based on French exposures, but the interpretation is Levi’s. In “The AEnigma of the Sphynx” Pike seeks the origins of Blue Masonry and the significance of the Master’s Word. Regarding the meaning of an allegedly Hebrew word Pike remarks: “‘What! is this the Builder?’ seems to us as far removed from being a true interpretation, as ‘marrow in the bone.”’ Although in this instance Pike reiterates what wrote ten years earlier in The Book of the Words he fails to mention that he accepted the former interpretation and included it ir~ his first version of the Scottish Rite rituals. 2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The title Lecrenda XIX—XXX is misleading as Pike omitted chapters on the 200, 220, 230, 240, and 290. For the degrees which are represented Pike provided both historical and symbolic instruction. Arthur Edward Waite, always hostile to Pike’s recension, commented on “the poverty of invention by which Pike was always characterized” in an article on the Twenty-eighth Degree, or Knight of ~he Sun, in his New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry . If Pike was to be thus criticized Waite is to be scolded, for his article describes not the workings of Pike’s rituals but those of the Cerneau organization, a pseudo—Masonic group which was an~,th ema to members of the genuine Scottish Rite.’ Pike’s supplementary information for both the 280 and 300 in the Lecrenda fill the lacunae of the ritual by providing essential information, without which, in Pike’s opinion, initiation is not complete 1 as the following excerpts likewise infer. “We shall permit you... to read in the Legenda.... You may find something in the reading, which will profit you.” “Wholly unknown to most men, and misunderstood by all others, except the Adepts, the Kabalah and Hermeticism are generally held in slight esteem, and believed to contain only an incoherent mysticism. We desire to dispel this illusion, but time will not permit us to do it now, and we must again invite you to study the residue of our instruction in the Legenda. --Twenty-eighth Degree, Knight of the Sun The XXXII 0 . Lecrenda rAl-B. commences with an explanation of the teachings and symbolism of the Scottish Rite degrees from Entered Apprentice through Knight Kadosh.

Pike then turns to extolling his view of Masonry’s religious tolerance: “No Atheist can be a Mason, nor should any irreligious libertine be permitted to become one. Masonry is of no Church, but it respects all, so far and so long as they only teach and persuade, and allow full freedom of thought and freedom of conscience, and the right of private judgment. Therefore the Scottish Free—masonry owes to itself to declare that it disowns anarchists in religion as it disowns anarchists in politics. Not deciding upon or discussing the merits of rival and contending creeds, God, Religion and Worship are not for it hateful or even indifferent words; and those who deny all these and audaciously declare an Atheistic independence of all religious faith, cannot be of its household.” The second part, or Lecrenda B as it is called, was to be studied by the member of the Rite “until he is completely master of the information contained herein.” It is a treatise which serves as an admirable introduction to Pike’s monumental studies, Indo—Arvan Deities and WorshiD as Contained in the Ricr—Veda (1872), Irano—Arvan Faith and Doctrine as Contained in the Zend — Avesta (1874) and Lectures of the Arva (l873).~ It constitutes, also, a study of comparative religion and philosophy which greatly enhances one’s understanding of Pike’s hauts crrades (300 ~320) The Readincrs XXXII 0 contain some of Pike’s most interesting speculative works.

We will limit ourselves to a few brief remarks on isolated tidbits. Pike remarked that one possible derivation of the word “Heirodom” may be from the Greek heiros, holy, and domos, house. John Yarker claimed credit for Pike’s view in this regard. In a scathing review of Waite’s Secret Tradition in Freemasonry (1911 ed.) written for Aleister Crowley’s Ecruinox, Yarker explains, “I can provide first-hand light as to the transliteration of the word into Heredomus, or Holy House. Many years ago, or about 1870, I was in correspondence with Mr. J.W. Papworth on the subject, and he put the question to very learned friend whom he knew at the British Museum, and who suggested to him the above derivation. As he requested that his name should not appear I sent it to the the Freemason’s Magazine , under the signature of [delta], and it was at once adopted by Pike; hence the term ‘Holy House’ is about forty years old.” 9 In his chapter, “The Symbolic Camp,” Pike struggles to decipher the “words” appearing upon the apron of the Thirty-second degree: SALIX, NONIS, TENGU. By 1880 he had abandoned the interpretation presented in the Macmum Opus 10 and left the words without explanation in the degree.

Pike’s Morals and Dogma was once delivered as a gift to each candidate of the Scottish Rite. It has unfortunately been replaced with Rex R. Hutchens, A Bridae to Light (Washington, D.C.: Supreme Council, 330, 1988). Hutchens’ work is useful for its brief description of the degree work, its fine illustrations, its historical overview and its explanation of Masonic symbolism, but it offers only the most meager of morsels from Morals and Dogma. Ideally both works should be given to candidates with A Bridge to Light serving as an introduction to Morals and Dogma rather than a substitute.

Who now possesses the key to that meaning? Nor is it only the Symbols of that first revelation which we term Creation, that are misinterpreted. The Oracles, also, have always spoken in enigmas, and whoso has not divined their meaning has, in attempting it, died. The sacred Books of the Hebrews are also Oracles—a succession of symbols and allegories—which those who read them literally the least understand. Who can interpret the Prophecies and the Apocalypse? INIAsONRY also has its ancient Symbols, inherited from the Mysteries aud the Kabalah, and intended to veil and conceal the truth from all except the Adepts. Like the religions, also, Masonry gives false interpretations of its Symbols, to mislead those who would not value the highest philosophical truth, and the Profane to whom these interpretations may be divulged. The Statue of Truth is always veiled. Nature reluctantly yields np to us her secrets, so that as yet we know them only in part, and imperfectly.

So also it is with Truth and Error; for Error is the shadow of the Light.

The historians of the Order do not know how to explain the origin of it. Some ascribe it to a free association of Masons, formed at the time of the building of the cathedral of Strasburg: others give it Cromwell for founder, without troubling themselves to inquire whether the rites of the English Masonry of the time of Cromwell were not organized against that chief of the Puritan anarchy; and others are ignorant enough to attribute to the Jesuits, if not the foundation, at least the continuation and direction of this society, long secret and always mys - terious. Rejecting this last opinion, which refutes itself, we may reconcile the others, by saying that the Brethren-masons (fr~res-ma~~on.s) borrowed from the builders of the Cathedral of Strasburg their name and the emblems of their art; and that they were publicly organized for the first time in Eng - land, under favor of its radical institutions, and in despite of the despotism of Cromwell. “We may add, that they have had the Templars for models, the Roses-croix for fathers, and the Johannites for ancestors. Their dogma is that of Zoroaster and Hermes; their rule is progressive initiation; their principle, equality, regulated by the hierarchy and universal fraternity: they are the continuers of the sehool of Alexandria, heirs of all the ancient initiations; they are the depositaries of the secrets of the Apocalypse and the Sohar; the object of their worship is Truth, repre - sented by the Light; they tolerate all creeds, and profess but one and the same philosophy; they search for Truth alone, teach only Reality, and desire to lead all intelligences pro - gressively to Reason. “The allegorical object of Masonry is the rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon: its real object is the reconstitution of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"LEGENDA, L 9 social unity, by the alliance of Reason a~Fnif~; s~ :~e re- establishment of the Hierachy, in accordu~a~ wi~ knowledge and virtue; with initiation and tests by means o~ degrees. “Nothing is finer, we see, nothing grander than these ideas; but unfortunately the doctrines of unity and of sub - mission to the hierarchy have not been preserved in the urn - versal Masonry. There soon sprung up a dissident Ma - sonry, opposed to the orthodox, and the greatest calamities of the French Revolution were the consequences of this schism. “The Freemasons have their sacred legend; that of HIRAM completed by that of C’~us and ZERUBBABEL. “This is the legcnd of Hiram “When Solomon caused the Temple to be builded, he in - trusted his plans to an architect named HIRAM or HARAM. “This Architect, to establish order in the work, divided the laborers according to their skill and experience; and as their number was very great, in order to be able to recognize them, whether to employ them according to their capacity, or to remunerate them according to their work, he gave to each class, to the Apprentices, Fellows, and Masters, particular pass - words and signs. “Three Fellow-crafts who desired to usurp the rank of Mas - ter, without being entitled to it by their deserts, lay in wait at the three principal gates of t 1 ie Temple, and when Hiram was about to go forth, one of them demanded of him the Masters’ word, menacing him with his Rule. Hiram replied to him: ‘I did not so receive the word that you demand of me.” “The enraged Fellow-craft struck Hiram with his Rule of iron, and inflicted on him the first wound. “Hiram fled to another gate, and there found the second Fellow-craft: the same demand was made and the same reply given, and this time Hiram was struck with a square, or, as others say, with a lever."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"10 LEGENDA, L “At the third gate was the third assassin, who finished the Master with a blow of a mallet. “The three Fellow-crafts afterward hid the body under a pile of rubbish, and planted on this improvised grave a branch of Acacia, and then fled, like Cain after the murder of Abel. “Meanwhile Solomon, his Architect not returning, sent nine Masters to seek him. The branch of acacia led them to find the body; they drew it from the rubbish, and as it had remained there for some days, they cried, upon raising it, Mach- lenach I which means, ‘the flesh parts from the bones.’ “The last duties were performed to Hiram, and twenty- seven Masters were then sent by Solomon to search for the murderers. “The first was surprised in a cave ; a lamp burned near him, a rivulet ran at his feet, and a poniard was near him for his defence. The Master who entered the cavern recognized the assassin, seized the poniard, and stabbed him, saving ‘NEKUM ! ‘ a word that means ‘Vengeance.’ His head was carried to Solomon, who was angered on seeing it, and said to him who had killed the assassin: ‘ Wretch! did you not know that I had reserved to myself the right to punish? Then all the Masters prostrated themselves, and begged for pardon for him whom his zeal had carried too far. “The second murderer was betrayed by a man who had given him refuge. He was hidden in a grotto among the rocks, near a burning bush, over which glowed a rainbow, and a dog watched near him. The Masters eluded the vigi. lance of the dog, seized the criminal, bouud him, and led him to Jerusalem, where he was put to death. “The third assassin was killed by a lion, which it was necessary to conquer in order to gain possession of the body. But other versions say that the assassin defended himself against the Masters with an axe, until they succeeded in dis - arming him, when they took him to Solomon, who ordered him executed, to expiate his crime."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"LEGENDA, L 11 “Such is the first legend.

He strikes the Grand Master with the Rule. It is the history of the fir~ir. man put to death, in the name of the Law, by human passions. “The second is called YUBELO or HOBHEN.

He slays Hiram with the Mallet. “As the brutal instincts do, when they attempt to ‘~reate Order in the name of Violence, and Fear by crushing Intel - ligence.” “The branch of AcACIA on the grave of Hiram is like the Cross upon our altars. “It is the Sign of knowledge surviving knowledge, the green branch that announces another spring.” [Tile acacia, or, as it is to be read, akakia, in the Greek axaxia, from dxi, a point, is that genus oC trees to which belong that which yields the guni arabic, the mezquite, and the locust.

Freemasonry has been many different things, at different periods, and in the hands of different persons. It is not one and the same thing everywhere now. In some countries it is now a political association, its degrees having for its Initiates no philosophical signification whatever. In the United States, the Blue Degrees teach morality only, refuse to inter - meddle with questions political or religious, and require only a belief in God, and, faintly, in the im.rnortality of the soul; except so far as they declare the Holy Bible to be the rule and guide of man’s conduct, and the inspired Word of God; which, if it were not evaded in practice, by the admission of Hebrews, would make the Masonry of the United States a strictly Christian Association. In the earlier part of the eighteenth century, Freemasonry was, for many of its Initiates, the teaching of the Hermetic philosophy. There are, we are told, six different Kadoshes, that which belongs to the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite being the veritable philosophical Kadosh: and so there have been, and still are, several Free - masonrics, of which this Rite is the only true philosophical one.

To pretend that they have been transmitted to us from antiquity is a mere fable. By the same process, an Egyptian hieroglyph might bc made to mean anything. To these protended interpretations it is owing, and to those blind guides who look no further into Masonry, that intelligent men find so little to attract and interest them in Masonic Symbolism, and that much which is found in tlic degrees seems trivial and sometimes absurd. Frecmasonry must once have had other and very different purposes, and other and vastly more interesting and impor - tant objects, than those for which, in the United States and England, at least, it now exists.

In times when it is unpopular or dangerous to teach the truth, Wisdom sometimes wisely wears the mask of Folly, and many of the grotesque fables of the old mythologies and of the myths that came afterward to be regarded as history, had a likc origin. But when it is gravely and persistently attempted to trans. form mere follies and pretended traditions into historical facts, to deny or doubt which is to be heretical or sceptical, and these pretended facts of history are imposed upon a whole Order and upon the world, and excite the derision and contempt of men of learning, it is time to endeavor, from the mass of historical falsehoods, to extricate the simple truth.

Some of the syrnbo~s are to be found there, and, older still, in the religious mysteries of other countries; but the explanationa were never written, for any to read who chose. Like the oracles of the Gods, they were always covered with a veil, spoken of in enigmatical language, and false interpretations of them publicly given, to mislead those to whom it was not deemed wise to intrust them. This was done in all the mysteries, to the end that it might be known, after a time, who among the maii~’ had the intelligence, the zeal, and the eagerness for knowledge, that could enable them to divine or entitle them to receive, in a higher circle, the true explanations, know the mysterious secrets, and becomo possessed of the Holy doctrine."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"32 THE £NIGMA OF THE BPHYNL We think that these secret meanings are always concealed in one manner and upon one plan, the same as those by which the Alchemists and Hermetic philosophers and Kabalista concealed their meaning inader the double veil of their jargon and its pretended interpretation, the true signification being only hinted at and perhaps never openly disclosed. We think that there is less that is really trivial in the ceremonial of the Blue Degrees than appears upon itB face; and that almost everything haa an occult significance, much of which is per - haps so completely lost, that it may never be discovered. We doubt if we yet know the meaning of some of the simplest things: and we are sure that very little is correctly explained in the Blue Lodge, even the preparation of the Candidate, and the relative positions of the Compasses and the Square in the different degrees. We know that the mysteries of Mithra were practised in Rome even after Christianity became the State religion of the Empire.

At all events, we know that early in the seventeenth cen - tury, inaiiy of the learned heads in England were occupied with theosophy, kabalism, and alchemy. Chief among these was Dr. iRobert Fludd, who began to write in 1616, and died in 1637. lIe wrote the Summum Bon.um, published in 1629, and an Apology for the ]?o&icrucian.~, published in 1617. ile was intimate with Maier, while the latter was in England, and as the books published in Germany, relating to alchemy or other occult knowledge, were sent to England and speedily translated, he could easily have become acquainted with the three works of Andreii. About 1633 the name of Rosicrucians was dropped in Eng. land, and that of Saphoi, Sages or Adepts, adopted. “We transmute,” said Fludd, “the dead stones into living philo- - sophical stones.” Elias Ashmole, the antiquary, was one of this sect, who, as is well known, was received into a Lodge of Operative Masons. He, with William Lilly, Drs. Wharton I 3"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"34 TEE ANIGMA OF THE SPHYNX.. and Hewson, and others, established a Society which had some meetings at Warrington, about 1646, before it was finally settled in London. Their purpose was to construct, in the literal sense of the word, the House of Solomon on the Island of Bensalem, in secret, and they clothed their purpose in symbols. Nicolsi of Berlin says that they first erected the pillars of Hermes, from whose holy sentences lamblichus answered all the doubts of Porphyry. Then they advanced, by a ladder of seven steps, to a chequered pavement, and were shown the symbols of the Creation or the work of five days. And, Nicolay says, “to cover thcir secret and mysterious meetings, they got admitted, in London, into the Masons’ Company, and held their meetings at the Masons’ Hall, in Masons’ Alley, Basinghall-street, and as freemen of London could take the name of Freemasons.” There would of course be no history or record of the origin of the new Initiation. There is none of the origin of the mysteries or of any Ancient Order. Their first beginnings are always secret, and not intrusted to the treachery of written records. It is certain that the Association or Order became suddenly and at a bound, a different thing from that which it was before, ceasing at once to be operative, aud multiplying its members with great rapidity among all classes of men. It is especially nonsensical to derive Masonry in its present form from the Steinmetzen and Operative Masons, while admitting that neither of these ever practised anything like the Master’s Degree, in which, it may be said, Blue Masonry wholly con - sists.

Thus viewed, Freemasonry is the heritage given to us by the remotest Past; the greatest, the oldest, the most venerable of all human institutions.

It limits itself to so much as is useful to bind together in a kind of Brotherhood the mass of a numerous Order. In the lesser mysteries no more was ever required.

The Masonry of the Higher Degrees teaches the great truths of Intellectual Science; but as to all these, even as to the rudiments and first principles, Blue Masonry is absolutely dumb. Its drama ~eema intended to teach the resurrection of the body; but it teaches nothing more. As the truths of politics, the great principles of human freedom, free government, free thought, and free conscience could not safely be proclaimed to the mass of Initiates as the cause to which by their associ - ation and by the oaths that insured secrecy and co-operation, they were to be devoted, so it was unnecessary, for the pur - pose of such union and co-operation, to teach the philosophical truth. Of this, and of religious Truth, all that is taught is incinded in a single question and answer: “In whom do you put your trust ?“—“ In God.” It was necessary that a Candidate should profess his belief in a Deity, since otherwise his oath would have no mor 0 bindiz~g force than a simple promise."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"40 A~NI0MA OF THE SPHYNX.

And it is a greater absurdity, if that is possible, that nearly the whole of the immense mass that has thus been written has little or no real connection with Blue Masonry, and might with quite as much propriety have been written upon any other text.

There, also, it was connected with the higher degrees, already existing, or from time to time invented, in France.

When there was no longer hope of the restoration of the Stuarts, the higher Degrees, which had become a part of the system of Scottish Freemasonry, were carried to England by the adherents of Laurence Dermott, of whose politics we know nothing; and with the annihilation of that hope the purposes of that Freemasonry changed. Becoming connected with some, and giving birth to others, of the higher Degrees, the system became philosophical and of course anti-papal, because Rome was the enemy of both Science and Philosophy. The English Masonry stood still. Suspicious of the higher Degrees, it refused to recognize them as Masonic, or to form any connection with them, or with the Royal Arch of Dermott, framed from the Royal Arch of Enoch. It changed its lectures and formulas, again and again; but it never had any especial object, after the struggle of the adherents of the Stuarts had ended.

Idolatry is but the worship of an arbitrary despotism; and the kings of the world and the chiefs of republics are made after the image of the Gods whom the world or the republic adores. A cruel and vin - dictive God permits bloody revenges to be preached in His churches and authorizes all the barbarities of autocrats. When men shall conceive of a just God, charity and loving-kindness will be preached in His Temples, and there will be equitable kings and merciful and generous popular chiefs.

HISTORY OF THE VEHM-GERICHT. [From Kohirausch ‘s ‘History of German. 7 BEFORE we conclude our description of the state of judicial affairs in the middle-ages, we will contemplate one of its most remarkable institutions, namely, that of the Vehm or Fehmgericht (secret executive tribunal), which formed itself in Westphalia, and which gives us a profound view of the spirit of that period. But, for the sake of connection, we must previously enter upon and anticipate the limits of the immediate succeeding period. In Westphalia the jurisdiction of the princes and nobles was wholly founded upon the Gogerichte or Centgraviates. The ancient tribunal, however, of the Graf or Count had also maintained itself, although much diminished in authority, as the supreme and royal court. The high nobility and the families comprising the original free-land proprietors, who had continued free from fiefs and had never become the vassals of the dominant lords, could alone be chosen as Schdfen or ministers in this court, they being called on that account Freischoffen, or free ministers and judges, and the court was styled a free court or tribunal. Again, as the rights of the free tribunals were attached"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 7 to the primitive rights of the ancient juzi~diction of the counties, so also those of the Stuhlherr were connected with the Freistuhis or free courts; for the term Stublherr was applied to every prince, noble and knight, who as judicial lord possessed a jurisdiction which did not de - pend upon the Emperor. The Stuhlherr was appointed to watch especially that justice was done. For this purpose he created a Freigraf or Free Count, who was invested with authority by the Emperors, or Dukes; and after the fall of Henry the Lion, he was appointed by the Arch - bishop of Cologne as inheritor of the Duchy of Westphalia. The Free Count stood in the same affinity to the Stuhlherr as the judge or judicial lord; the Freischof - fen, however, were not servants of the judge, but they represented the ancient community or jury, and the Free Count was only the president or foreman who maintained order in the assembly. All the Freischoffen present possessed the right to participate in pronouncing judg - ment; a less number than seven members could not form a court, and if there were too many to enable all to take an immediate part in the proceedings, the remainder formed the audience, of whom, in the later and more splendid periods of this tribunal, there were assembled hundreds and even thousands. Besides this, every Free Count had his clerks, who were called Fronboten and were appointed to serve him especially, taking no share in the decisions of the court. The superior Freistuhl or tribunal was at Dortmund, that city being a free city of the empire and acknowl -"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"8 TWENTY-FIRST DECREE. edging no Stuhlherr or judicial lord, owing, perhaps, to the antiquity and celebrity of its tribunal, as well as the aboriginal privileges it had acquired in the time of Charlemagne. In Dortmund all the Free Counts as - sembled every year to meet a general Chapter, where they founded Weisthiimer, or principles of law, examined the judgments of the free courts, and confirmed or put them aside when an appeal was entered. As these tribunals drew their origin from those of the ancient county courts, it will be readily perceived that they exercised a jurisdiction over ordinary legal disputes, which we call civil actions, as also over penal cases, which pre-suppose a crime. But this last division of their office, at that time so important, became still more so in the course of time, in order to enable them to exercise their whole power in suppressing as much as possible the savage spirit existing so universally and among all classes to commit the most serious crimes against life, honour and property. And as they adjudged in the name of the Emperor and by the law of life and death, they thought that in all criminal affairs they could extend their juris - diction beyond the limits of Westphalia, more especially as not another tribunal existed throughout the empire so authorized, from which to obtain justice against criminals. In fact, such influence did this tribunal command that at length no cases of contention, nor even purely civil disputes, arose which could not be brought before them for decision, if the defendant refused to do justice and honour to the plaintiff; for thence the crime"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"LEGENDk became one absolutely confirmed ag~L~: sazdtv of the law. Thus in the fourteenth and flftee~h ~e~turies the power of the Freigerichte extended over all parts of Ger - many, as far as Prussia and Livonia, while all complaints, even from the most distant districts, were obliged to be brought before a Westphalian superior tribunal, and it was upon Westphalian ground (styled in the judicial language the red earth) that the cited person was forced to appear. Beyond Westphalia no such Freistuhl could exist, and when the Emperor Wenceslas endeavored to introduce one in Bohemia, the Free Counts declared that any one participating in such a Freistuhl incurred the penalty of death. Thus originally it was Westphalians alone, and of these only the ancient free born schoffen or Stuhlfreien, that could be constituted judges in the tribunal; but in the thirteenth century it was the custom to receive also other free, irreproachable, and honourable men as Sch~iffen, and when the court itself extended its jurisdiction beyond the boundaries of Westphalia, every free German could become a Freischoffe; and princes, counts, knights and citizens strove to attain the honour of participating in the privileges of Freisch6ffen. A Freis - choffe could be cited only before a Freigericht or free tribunal, and great weight was laid upon his word and oath. But they were very careful and strict in their elec - tion of a Freischdffe; he was obliged to prove that he was free born, of a good family, not suspected of any misdeeds, and was in the enjoyment of all his rights; and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"10 TWENTY-FIRST DECREE. finally two Freischoffen were obliged to become his security. The reception could take place only in West - phalia. Even the Emperor himself could make Freis - ch6ffen only upon the so-called red earth, in this superior court. They had among them a very ancient, secret sign and peculiar greeting whereby they recognized each other, whence, or perhaps from their knowledge of the laws, they were called the initiated, and in order to make any one knowing or wise implied receiving him among the Sch6ffen of the superior tribunal; even Emperors were subjected to this reception, for in the year 1429 the Emperor Sigismund was solemnly received among the in - itiated at the Freistuhl of Dortmund. We may consider these courts of justice in Westphalia, at this brilliant mo - ment of their existence, when almost all the princes, nobles, and knights became Freischdffen, as an absolute and important association which, in all its ramifications, spread over the whole of Germany and which, at a time when all the other courts had lost their power, acted as a substitute and constituted a barrier against the rude and brutal force of crime. A solemn oath held all the members united, and not even in the confessional were they suffered to reveal a secret of the Vehm tribunal; neither were the clergy themselves admitted into it. Originally the non-initiated were not taken at once before the secret tribunal but before the ancient tribunal of the community or jury court (the Echte Ding), but that was formed by the same individuals; the forms only were less severe, and likewise there everyone could be present."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"LECENDA. Ii But if the cited individual did not appear, he was then taken before the closed or secret court, so called because only those initiated could be present, and any non- initiated one venturing to introduce himself was im - mediately hanged. The term secret here, therefore, implied closed court and does not indicate those terrible mysteries which dared not be exhibited before the light of day. It is equally as fabulous that these tribunals were held at night in woods, caverns and subterranean vaults, although in later times, when this court had become degenerated, it may have occurred in isolated cases. But the place of meeting was the ancient palace-court of the Grafs or Counts, generally upon a mountain or hill, whence the eye could command a view of the entire coun - try around, under the shade of lime-trees and by the light of the sun. The Free Graf or Count ascended and pre - sided on the seat of justice; before him lay the sword, the symbol of supreme justice, at the same time representing, in the form of its handle, the cross of Christ, and the next to it the Wyd or cord, as a sign of right over life and death. The Count then opened and closed the court; that is, he called the Sch6ffen around him and assigned to them their places. They were obliged to appear bare - headed and without arms or armour. Upon the Judge’s declaration that the court was opened, peace was com - manded for the first, second and third time.

The cited person, who was also obliged to appear without arms, stepped forward, accompanied by his two sureties or bail, if he had any. The complaint made against him was stated to him by the judge, and if he swore upon the cross of the sword the legal oath of purification, he was free. “He shall then take Kreuzpfen - fig or farthing.piece,” says an ancient work on jurisprudence, “throw it at the feet of the court, turn round and go his way. Whoever attacks or touches him, has then, which all freemen know, broken the king’s peace.” Such was the ancient proceeding with the gen - uine Freischoffen, who enjoyed particular privileges, and who were presumed to have a strict love for truth and honour. In later times, that simple, straightforward way seems to have become quite changed, for we read in other ancient codes that the plaintiff was entitled to oppose and destroy the validity of the purifying oath of the defendant by three witnesses, which, however, the latter could again oppose with six; if the accuser appeared with fourteen, the defendant could swear himself free with twenty-one, which was the highest testimony. If the defendant acknowledged the crime, or if the plaintiff convicted him by oath and witnesses, the Schciffen then gave judgment. If the criminal received sentence of death, he was ex - ecuted immediately and hanged on the next tree; the minor punishments were exile and fine.

The sentence pronounced by the Court was dreadful: “As now N. has been cited, prosecuted, and adjudged before me, and whom, on account of his misdeeds, I summoned before me, and who is so hardened in evil that he will obey neither honour nor justice and despises the highest tribunal of the holy empire, I verfeme, or de - nounce him here, by all the royal power and force, as is but just, and as is commanded by the Konigsbann, [the royal ban].

And I adjudge his neck to the rope, and his body to be devoured by the birds and beasts of the air, sea and land; but his soul I commend to our dear Lord God, if He will receive it.” According to some customs, after he had cast forth the rope beyond the walls of the court, the Count was obliged to pronounce these words three times, and every time to spit on the earth with the collective Sch6ffen, as was the usage when any one was actually executed. The name of the condemned criminal was then inserted in the book of blood, and the Count then concluded the sentence as follows: “I command all kings, princes, lords, knights and squires, all free counts and all free, true Schciffen, and all those who belong to the holy empire, that they shall help with all their power to fulfill this sentence upon this banished criminal, as is but just to the secret tribunal of the holy empire. And nothing shall cause them to with - hold from so doing, neither love nor affection, relation - ship, friendship, nor anything whatever in this world.” The banished man was now in the condition of the criminal condemned to death, over whom execution lowered.

In the great development and extension of the association, it could not be avoided but that unworthy individuals should be received as members who used the power confided to them for the sole satisfac - tion of their revengeful and baser passions. At the end of the fifteenth century many complaints arose in several parts of the empire, and particularly on the part of the clergy, against these free courts; and we find that the whole spirit of modern times began to work against them far more than these charges upon isolated events.

In the sixteenth century, the association contended for its rights and privileges, and the struggle still continued in the seventeenth century, although much weakened and the scene confined to Westphalia. In the eighteenth cen - tury there were left only a few traces, the ruins of the past; its recollections and its signs, however, still con - tinued to exist among the peasants of certain provinces in Westphalia. At Gehmen in Munster the secret tribunal was only extingnished entirely by the French legislation in 1811; and even to the present day some of the free peasants who have taken the oath of the Schoffen, meet annually at a particular spot around the Freistuhi, and it has been impossible to extract from them the secret oath.

IN Greece every person who came to the solemn sacrifices was purified by water. To which end, at the en - trance of the temples there was commonly placed a vessel full of holy water. This water was consecrated by putting into it a burning torch taken from the altar. The same torch was sometimes made use of to besprinkle those who entered into the temple. Thus we find in Euripides: M~ll6n de dal6n ch~iri dkcia ph~r~in EL5 chSrnib’ liis baps~in, Alkmen~s t5k6s: ‘Alcm~ne~’s son now being about to bear; ‘In hi.s right hand the torch, unto the holy water, ‘Then to wash.’ Also in Aristophanes: Ph~r~ de to dadi3n, tod’ embapso lab 8n: ‘Bring now the torch! L taking it, will immerse it.’ Where the scholiast observes, that this torch was used because of the quality of fire, which is thought to purify all things. Instead of the torches, they sometimes used a branch of laurel, as we find in Pliny. Thus Sozomen, where he speaks of Valentinian following Julian into a pagan temple, relates, that when they were about to enter, a priest thall~us tinas diabr5ch3us kat~ch3n, n~m6 H~ll~nikJ p~ri&rain~, ‘holding certain green boughs dropping water, besprinkled them after the Grecian i I I"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"20 TWENTY-THIRD DECREE. manner.’ Instead of laurel, olive was sometimes used. Thus we find in Virgil: Idem ter socios pura circumtulit undi, Spargens rore levi et ramo felicLs olivce. ‘Old Corynceus compass d thrice the crew, And di~p ‘d an olive branch in holy dew.’ This custom of surrounding, here expressed, was so constant in purifying, that most of the terms which relate to any sort of purification are compounded with ,r~p) around. Thus p~ rirrainein, p~ rimatt~sthai, p~ rith~i6un, p~ragniz~in; ‘to sprinkle round about, to purify all round, to fumigate all round, to wash or purify all round,’ etc. The vessel which contained the water of purification was termed p~rirrant~rit3n. And the Latin word lust rare, which signifies to purify or expiate, came hence to be a general word for any sort of surrounding or encompass - ing. Thus it is used by Virgil: dum montibus umbrce Lustrabunt convexo. ‘While the shadows from the mountains shall In the convex expanse wander around.’ Spandanus tells us that before the sacrifices of the celestial gods, the worshippers had their whole bodies washed, or if that could not be, at least their hands; but for those that performed the sacred rites of the infernal gods, a small sprinkling was sufficient. Sometimes the feet were washed as well as the hands; whence came the proverbs: aniptc3is ch~rsin, ‘with unwashed hands,’ and aniptdis pc5sin, ‘with unwashed feet,’ in Latin illotis manibus, and illotis pedibus, which are usually applied to"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"LEG ENDA. men who undertake anything withou: ~-:~ ~ a~ ~re- paration. Porphyry tells us there was a p~z~aa fixed up, that no man should go beyond tie ~r rcn~t&ion till he had washed his hands; and so great a crime was it ac - counted to omit this ceremony, that Timarchides hath related a story of one Asterius, who was struck dead with thunder because he had approached the altar of Jupiter with unwashed hands. Nor was this custom only used at solemn sacrifices, but also at the smallest parts of their worship. Hector tells us he was afraid to make so much as a libation to Jupiter before he had washed: Ch~rsi d’ anipt6isin Dii l~ib~in dith3pa 6in6n H’az6ma~. ‘I dread with unwash ‘d hands to bring My incens ‘d wine to Jove an offering.’ And Telemachus is said in Homer’s Odysseis to have washed his hands before he adventured to pray to the gods. This they did out of a conceit that thereby they were purified from their sins; and withal signifying, that nothing impure ought to approach the deities. On the same account they sometimes washed their clothes, as Homer relates of Penelope before she offered prayers to the gods. The water used in purification was required to be clear and without mud and all other impurities. It was commonly fetched from fountains and rivers. The water of lakes or standing ponds was unfit for this purpose. So was also the purest stream, if it had been a considerable time separated from its source.

The Apostle seems to allude to the same practice in the following words: “Let us draw near,.., having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.” The Prophet Ezekiel, in like manner: “Then I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.” But if sea-water could be procured, it was preferred before all others, because by reason of its saltness, phus~i t6 hud6r t~s thalass~s kathartik6n esti, ‘the water of the sea is naturally cleansing,’ as we are informed by the scholiast upon Homer.

It has been calculated that the extent of the city along the river, following a bend of it, was between two and three miles. To the southwest was a copious spring, standing by which, one has an extensive and uninterrupted view of the beautiful plains of the Houran or Hauran, bounded on the opposite side by the snow-capped mountains of the Haish. The Prophet Ezekiel refers to these fertile plains in his vision respect - ing the borders of the land (xlvii. 16—19), “Hazar - hatticon, which is by the coast of Houran.. . and the east side ye shall measure from Houran and from Damascus.” The Romans called the Houran, ‘per~a,’ and divided it into six cantons, the most northern being that of Abilene, between Lebanon and the Anti-Libanus. The mountain Gebel al Sheik, in the Anti-Libanus, due west from Damascus, is supposed to be the highest of that region, its summit being perpetually covered with snow.

The land promised to Abraham and his seed forever lies in full view, high mountains with snowy tops sparkling in the morning sunlight 1 marking a bold outline against an intensely blue sky. On the summits and in the valleys and delIs of these mountains the people known as the “Druses” dwell, a people isolated from all others in the matter of faith and doctrines and in regard to the hopes and fears which are connected with the unknown land in - to which the dead enter. The Druses are supposed to be the descendants of those Hivites among whom the Hebrews dwelt in the time of Joshua, and afterward, upon Mount Lebanon. They never adopted the Hebrew religion, but they were com - pelled, ages afterward, to accept that of Mohammed, although they continued to worship in secret caverns and solitudes, according to the faith of their fathers, which was a mixture of various beliefs, of legends and superstitions. The Druses on the Lebanon are estimated to amount to about 29,000 souls. According to their own tradition, the Druses believe that their ancestors originally dwelt upon that range of mountains which is situated between Laodicea and the extensive plains of the Amuk, now exclusively inhabited by fierce and little known Ansyrii tribes. Though not the most numerous, the Druses are ac - knowledged to be the most warlike and courageous people inhabiting the Lebanon.

Some of their Akals or Ockals say that the name Druse is derived from the Arabic word durs, which signifies ‘clever, industrious;’ others, that it is from the Arabic word turs, ‘shield’; and that they are called by it, because in the time of the Crusades they were selected by Nur - eddin and Salah-eddin to watch and defend the line of coast from Beyrout to Sidon. The cities Ammatam and Bachlin are sacred to the Druses of Lebanon. They are rallying points, where, in time of trouble and warfare, the tribes meet and swear allegiance to each other and to their cause, standing in their Khalu~ or Mosque, where all the books of their faith are gnarded religiously and with jealous zeal. In Anti- Lebanon the cities Hasbeya and Rosheya answer the same purpose; and whenever anything is astir, going wrong or suspicious, the news is telegraphed from these points through the Druse Districts with startling rapidity, by means of bonfires lit at various points; and .the scene then presented by the mountains is there wild and pic - turesque beyond description.

In many villages of the Anti-Libanus, the Druse in - habitants appear strictly to adhere to the tenets of the Mohammedan law, being scrupulous in their attendance to rites and ceremonials, observing rigidly the Ramazan; but in this they only obey the precept of their own faith, which in secret they devoutly cherish. The Khalues, or edifices erected for worship, are simple, differing outwardly but little from the Druse houses generally, are whitewashed or plastered with lime, usually set apart from the villages upon commanding positions, where, by means of sentries stationed, they are secure against interruption or the prying propensities of the inquisitive while engaged in performing the secret duties of their religion. The floors are covered with rush mats and there is always a basin, filled by a running stream. All the Khalue’s have property attached to them, the revenues of which are consecrated to the relief of the poor and the demands of hospitality. Two or three are dedicated to the Prophet Aylib, and in the one at Neeha, in the district of the Shoof, which stands on a lofty escarped rock, a lamp is kept burning night and day. The clergy and the learned doctors and the elders con - stitute the class of Akals among the Druses.

They are more especially regarded as ministers of peace. Their very presence banishes discord, and when - ever a Druse peasant meets an Akal, he salutes him as one who is the harbinger of peace and happiness and kisses his hand with reverence and affection. They exercise great influence in temporal matters, for no one would think of entering any place or conducting an affair without consulting the Akals. Nothing of impor - tance would be attempted, even by a Sheik, without their advice and approval; and altogether, they exercise a general control and supervision over the manners, morals and proceedings of the Druse people, which has a most beneficial effect.

The passages that here now follow are extracted from the Druse books without comment. When men were created, they knew not the origin of their existence, nor did they seek God by their works. Wherefore He impressed upon their souls convictions of truths, and the knowledge of truth, so that they knew and acknowledged Him. He manifested His Self unto them by His works, and by His revelations of Himself in Nature, taught them His greatness and made them to know His unity, so that they said, “God in great: There is no God but God.” Thus He called them unto Him, say - ing, “Am I not your God?” and they believed in the unity of the Most High."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 31 It was the Most Wise Intellect which was saz.din.~ with God in the place of a priesthood, invi~ng ~e people to know their Creator, the Most High, and His Unity.

The third is that of the abandonment of the worship of idols, formed in the mind by false and distorted concep - tions of God, and seen with slavish superstition in the symbols which have usurped the places of the things sym - bolized, and become the objects of an ignorant reverence, and the fruitful source of false and impure religions. It is also that of the abandonment of the doctrine of those who believe in legends and fables, and of those who say that God is not present everywhere, in sympathy with His creatures, but somewhere remote from them, where He looks unconcernedly on, and sees the action of the Universe, and its forces, both of matter and intellect, pro - ceeding under the operation of ‘laws’ enacted by Him, which make His personal intervention and concern and interest unnecessary. It is also that of the abandonment of the doctrine of those who believe in traditions and babble nonsense, and say that God is not one.

The sixth is that of being satisfied with the acts of God, whatever they may be, not endeavoring to avoid the oper - ation of His laws or condemning as wrong or criminal anything whatsoever that is done in obedience to them, as they appear and act in Nature and Humanity.

The conclusion is, that whosoever knows and believes as the Seven Laws require, and is sound of mind and body, and of full age, and free from servitude, may be of those who are destined to the ranks, and entitled to be present at the private assemblies, at which whosoever is present must revere God and be true and generous to his Brother, and whosoever is absent with right to be present will repent it.

Yet He commands us to forgive those who trespass against us. And this law is not the mandate of His WILL, but the expression of His NATURE. Who will explain this great mystery? One serpent, the Sarap, on the Earth, is the Minister of Death. The image of another, Nakhish, lifted on high, heals and averts death. The first Sages who sought for the cause of causes saw Good and Evil in the world: they observed the Shadow and the Light; they compared Winter with Spring, Old Age with Youth, Life with Death: and said, “THE FIRST CAUSE IS Beneficent AND Cruel: It gives life and destroys.” “Are there, then, two contrary Principles, a Good and an Evil?” cried the disciples of Manes. No! the two Principles of the Universal Equilibrium are not contrary to each other, though in apparent op - position; for it is a Single Wisdom that opposes them one to the other.

The human equilibrium requires two feet: the worlds revolve by means of two forces; generation requires two sexes. Such is the meaning of the arcanum of Solomon, figured by the two columns of the Temple. The equilibrium is the resultant of two Forces. If the two forces are absolutely and always equal, the equilibrium will be immobility, and consequently non- life. Movement is the result of an alternating prepon - derance. The impulse given to one scale of a balance necessarily determines the movement of the other. Contraries thus act upon contraries, everywhere in nature, by corres - pondence and analogical connection. The whole of life consists in an inhalation and expira - tion of the breath. Creation is the sub-positing of a Shadow, to serve as a limit for the Light; of a void, to serve as a receptacle for the plenitude of Being; of a passive Principle impregnated, to support and manifest in reality the inherent power of the active generating Principle. All nature is of both sexes: and the movement which produces the appearance of life and death is a continual generation. The occult laws are often diametrically opposite to the ordinary ideas. Thus, for example, the vulgar believe in the sympathy of those who are alike, and the antagonism of the unlike; while the exact contrary is the real law."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 39 It used to be said: “Nature has a horcz v5a vacuum.” It should have been said: “Nature is a~.orous of the vacuum;” if vacuum were not, in physi~, the most ab - surd of fictions. GOD loves the Void, which He has made that He may fill it; Knowledge loves Ignorance, which it enlightens; Force loves Weakness, which it sustains; the Good loves the Ap - parent Evil, which makes it glorious; the Day is amorous of the Night and incessantly pursues it around the world. Love is at once a thirst and a fullness that must flow forth abroad. Whatever gives movement receives it; and whatever receives it gives it. It is a perpetual exchange. There are in nature four movements, produced by two forces, which sustain each other by their tendencies in opposite directions. And the law that rules bodies is both analogous and proportioned to that which governs Spirits; and the law which governs Spirits is the very manifestation of the Hidden Self of Deity; that is to say, of the mystery of Creation. To know the law of this interchange, of the alternating preponderance or simultaneous proportion of these Forces, is to be in possession of the first principles of the Grand Secret, which constitutes the true human Divinity. It is for you to discover this Law and this Secret for yourself. The Initiate learns by reflection, and not, like the children, by committing words and definitions to memory.

To make Light visible, and for that only, GOD has sub- joined shadow. To manifest the Truth, He has made doubt possible. Shadow is the foil of Light; and the possibility of Error is necessary, for the temporal forth-showing of Truth. If the buckler of Satan did not stay the flight of Michael’s lance, the power of the Archangel would be lost in the void, or would necessarily display and manifest itself by an infinite destruction, directed from above to below. And if the foot of Michael did not arrest Satan in his ascent, Satan would go to dethrone GOD, or to lose himself in the abysses of height. Satan in then necessary to Michael, as the pedestal to the statue; and Michael to Satan, as the brake to the locomotive. In analogical and universal dynamics we rest only on that which resists. Wherefore, as we have said before, the Universe is balanced by two forces, which maintain it in equilibrium; the force which attracts, and that which repels.

Whether it emanates from and will return to GOD, and what its con - tinued mode of existence hereafter, each judges for himself. Masonry was not made to settle that. Thus it disbelieves no truth and teaches unbelief in no creed, except so far so such creed may lower its lofty estimate of the Deity, degrade Him to the level of the pas - sions of humanity, deny the high destiny of man, impugn the goodness and benevolence of the Supreme GOD, strike at the great columns of Masonry, FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY, or inculcate immorality and disregard of the active duties of the Order. Masonry is a worship, but one in which all civilized men can unite, for it does not undertake dogmatically to settle those great mysteries that are above the feeble comprehension of our human intellect. It TRUSTS in GOD, and HOPES; it BELIEVES, like a child, and is humble. It draws no sword to compel others to adopt its belief or to be hap - py with its hopes. And it WAITS with patience to under - stand the mysteries of Nature hereafter.

Sickness also, caused by the rains and the intense heat, decimated the Christian forces. The wounded German soldiers, whom none of the others understood, could not make known their sickness nor their necessities. Certain German nobles from the cities of Bremen and Lubec, who had arrived at Acre by sea, moved by the miseries of their countrymen, took the sails of their ships and made of them a large tent, in which for a time they placed the wounded Germans and tended them with great kindness. Forty nobles of the same nation united with them and established a kind of hospital in the midst of the camp; and this noble and charitable association, like the knights of the Temple and of St. John of Jerusalem, soon and in - sensibly became a new Hospitaller and Military Order. This was in the year 1191. In 1192, Pope Celestin III, at the request of the Emperor, Henry the 6th, solemnly ap - proved of the Order by his Bull of the 23d of February. He prescribed as regulations for the new Knights, those of Saint Augustine; and for special statutes, in all that regarded the poor and sick, those of the Hospitallers of St. John; in regard to military discipline, the regulations of the Templars.

This was the origin of the Teutonic Order, the first branch of that of the Templars.” “The Chiefs, desiring to advance these pious gentle - men and to gratify the German nation, proposed to them the institution of a new Order of Chivalry, to be at once hospitaller and military. Forty German lords, distin - guished by their nobility and feats of arms, agreed to this and became the founders and original members of the Order. On entering the Order, they bound themselves by the three solemn vows and also obliged themselves to serve the poor, in imitation of the Hospitallers, and to follow the claustral and military discipline of the Templars in peace as well as in war. Their title of Knights of the House of St. Mary of Jerusalem was given them, because while the city of Jerusalem was under the government of the Latin Chris - tians, a German had erected there, at his own expense, a Hospital and Oratory for the sick of his nation, under the protection of and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

It received from the Holy See the same privileges as the Templars and Hospitallers, and the right was granted it of holding in perpetuity all such lands and pro - vinces as it might conquer from the Moslems.” “It was divided into seven Provinces: Armenia, Achaia, Sicily, Teutonica, Apulia, Austria, Prussia and Livonia.” “The Templars had adopted a form of government, in part monarchical and in part aristocratic, of which the Grand Master was the Chief, and the Marshal, Draper and Senechal, with the Provincial Masters, were the prin - cipal members. The Teutonic Knights adopted the same system, with the addition of a Jiospitaller, an office borrowed from the Knights of St. John the Baptist or Hospitallers.” The Grand Master was chosen by Electors.

The Treasurer or Senechal was also the Commissary- General of Supplies. There were also Chatelains or Governors of fortified places, with the Turcopiier and Chaplain. The Turcopilier commanded the light cavalry. In the Teutonic Order, the Marshal appointed him whenever oc - casion required. The Chaplain had charge of the Chapel and its orna - ments, and when the Knights lived in tents, he regulated the religious services. To distinguish this Order from the other two, they adopted the BLACK CROSS. It is ordinarily said that they also adopted the white mantle; but about the year 1210, the Templars of Palestine complained to Pope Innocent that after they had received from the Holy See the white mantle as the distinctive dress of their Order, the Teutonic Knights, and especially those of St. Jean d’Acre, had assumed to wear it. Innocent wrote to the latter and to their Grand Master, HERMAN B~iiT, a gentle - man of HOLSTEIN, and directed them that, in order to avoid all occasion for jealousy or quarrel, they should content themselves with their ordinary dress and leave the white color to the Templars; and at the same time he ordered the patriarch of Jerusalem to see to it that the Teutonic Knights should follow their first custom and to censure and so compel them to do it, if necessary.

The leading objects of the three great Military Orders were the same, and to them was well applied the phrase of the Preacher, the Son of David, the King of Jerusalem, “a three-fold cord is not quickly broken.” The Teutonic Knights soon rivaled the other Orders in numbers and influence. In 1223, Herman de Saltza, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, was present at a celebrated assembly convoked by Pope Honorius III, at Ferentino in Campania, to deliberate concerning the mode of raising succors for the Holy Land, at which were also present the Pope, the Emperor Frederic II, of Sicily, John, King of Jerusalem, the Bishop of Bethlehem, the Grand Masters of the Templars and Hospitallers, and other distinguished personages; and it was by the in - fluence of Herman de Saltza, 4th Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, then exercised, that Frederic espoused and married the daughter of the King of Jerusalem and engaged in a new crusade. In the year 1226 most of the Teutonic Knights went from the Holy Land to Prussia, the people of which were still idolaters, waging cruel war against their Christian neighbors, murdering Priests at the foot of the Altar and employing the sacred vessels for profane uses. Conrad, Duke of Masovia, called in the Teutonic Knights to his assistance and gave them, as a commencement for their establishment there, the whole territory of CuIm, with all lands they should conquer from the Infidels.

The Knights then entered those northern countries and by continued wars acquired in time the entire sovereignty of Royal and Ducal Prussia, Livonia and the Duchies of Courland and Semigal, all vast provinces and capable of forming a great kingdom. And when, in 1291, the Sultan stormed and took St. Jean d’Acre, the Teutonic Knights that sur - vived returned to Europe and joined their Brethren in Prussia and Livonia. In their war against the Heathen of Prussia, it is said, “they got great honor; and the Emperor, granting them permission to enjoy what by the sword they had wonne with expense of some blood, they purchased great revenues in Prussia, founded Konigsberg, Dantzick, and all the chief towns and built many illustrious edifices and some cathedrals, establishing bishops there, who were en - joyned to wear the habit of the Order.” In 1257, Pope Alexander accorded to the Teutonic Order all the indulgences, immunities and privileges before then granted by the Holy See to the two Houses, of the Temple and the Hospital, and this, because it ob - served with edification the Statutes of the Hospitallers in regard to the sick poor, and those of the Templars, in what regarded the functions of the Chaplains, Knights and other persons. “For this reason,” said the Pope, “it is just to make you the equals, in favors and privileges, of those whose virtues and good conduct you zealously"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"6 strive to imitate.” For many years the Teutonic Knights held Prussia as a fief depending on the Crown of Poland. During this period, fierce contests arose between the Grand Masters of the Order and the Kings of Poland, the former strug - gling for independence and the latter obstinately assert - ing their right of sovereignty. Albert, a Prince of the House of Brandenburg, elected Grand Master in 1511, engaged keenly in the quarrel and maintained a long war with Sigismund, King of Poland; but adopting the doc - trines of Luther, in 1525, he made a treaty with Sigis - mund, by which that part of Prussia belonging to the Order was erected into a secular and hereditary Duchy, and the investiture of it granted to Albert, who bound himself to do homage for it to the Kings of Poland as their vassal. Immediately afterward he publicly professed the Protestant faith and married a Princess of Denmark. The Knights exclaimed so loudly against his treachery that he was put under the ban of the Empire, but he kept possession of the Province he had usurped and trans - mitted it to his posterity; and in process of time it fell to the Electoral Branch of the family, all dependence on Poland was shaken off, and the Margraves of Branden - burg took the title of Kings of Prussia, which has thus become one of the leading powers of Europe.

After the Order of the Temple had been “suppressed, extinguished, and abolished,” in the year 1312, by the Papal Bull of the 6th of May of that year, by which all persons were forbidden to enter the Order, or to assume the name of Templars, or to wear their dress, under pain of excommunication, an extension of the same, in the same year, adjudged all the property and estates of the Templars to the Knights of Rhodes (of St. John, or the Hospitallers, afterward Knights of Malta), except such as were in the realms of Spain and without prejudice to the rights of any kings, princes or lords to any property of the Order in other countries. In Germany, all the princes desired to vest the property of the Templars in the Teutonic Order, in order to aug - ment and enrich it and create great establishments for their children. They insisted that at least a portion of the property should be adjudged thus, for the reason that it had in part been bestowed on the Templars by their ancestors. This demand was made in a tone that per - mitted no refusal, and the Pope accordingly yielded and consented to the division. No Templar were executed in German, and yet the Order disappeared.

Self-limited, manifested, and in act, the Deity becomes two in one, and the second number is obtained, the Binary.

This religion, of which all others have been the succes - sive veils and shadows, is that which demonstrates being by being, Truth by Reason, Reason by evidence and com - mon sense. It is it that proves by realities the reason of existence of hypotheses and admits no reasoning on hypotheses, in- dependently of and outside of realities. It has for its bases the dogma of universal analogies, but never confounds matters of Science with matters of Faith. It can never be an article of faith, that two and one make more or less than three; that, in physics, what is contained is greater than that which contains it; that a solid body, considered as solid, can act as a fluid or gaseous body; that a human body, for example, can pass through a closed door, without fracturing or opening it. To say that one believes such a thing is to talk like a child or a fool; but it is no less senseless to define the Unknown and to reason, from hypothesis to hypothesis, until we"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 85 reach the point of denying evidence, a priori, to affirm rash suppositions. The Sage affirms what he knows; and believes in what he does not know, only according to the measure of the reasonable and known necessities of hypothesis. But this reasonable religion cannot be that of the multitude, which must have fables, mysteries, well- defined hopes, and terrors based on material grounds; and therefore it was that Priesthood established itself in the world. Neither Liberty nor Science are given; they must be siezed. Humanity can make itself immortal and omni - potent only by its works, and this is especially demanded of it now. The Sanctuary has been despoiled and fallen into ruins, because its key has been flung away. Whoever shall know how to take and use that key will be a healer of the nations and a liberator of the world. To disclose the Absolute Truth never profits the common people. Fables and leading-strings always have been and always will be necessary for children, but those who hold the strings must not themselves be children and listeners to fables. Let the most Absolute Science and the highest Reason again become the appanage of the Chiefs of the people; let the Sacredotal Art and the Royal Art reassume the double sceptre of the ancient initiations, and the world will yet again emerge from chaos.

Without the Force the Science is nothing, or rather it is a danger. To give Force to Science alone is the Supreme law of initiations. Accordingly the Great Revealer has said, “The Kingdom of GOD submits to violence, and the violent take it by force.” The gate of the Truth is closed. To enter it, one must be a man. All miracles are promised to faith, but what is faith but the audacity of a will which does not hesitate in the darkness and which advances toward the light through all tests and by surmounting all obstacles! The Priesthood is recruited by initiation, and religious forms perish when initiation ceases in the Sanctuary, either by means of disclosure, or by neglecting and for - getting the sacred mysteries. The Gnostic disclosures, for example, estranged the Christian Church from the lofty truths of the Kabalah, which contains all the secrets of transcendental theology. Wherefore, the blind becoming the leaders of the blind,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 87 great obscurations resulted, great lapses, and deplorable scandals; and then the old sacred books, whose keys are all Kabalistic, from Genesis to the Apocalypse, became so unintelligible to the Christians that their shepherds, with good reason, deemed it necessary to forbid their being read by the unlearned faithful. Literally taken and materially understood, they would be but an inconceiv - able tissue of absurdities and scandals. The same is the case with all the ancient dogmas, with their brilliant theogonies and poetic legends. To say that the ancients believed, in Greece, in the amours of Jupiter, or worshiped, in Egypt, the ape and hawk as living and real gods, is to be as ignorant or act in as bad faith as if one were to assert that the Christians adore a triple GOD, composed of an old man, a person crucified and a pigeon. The non-understanding of symbols is always slanderous. And for this reason we should be carful not to scoff at first at things which we do not know when the enuncia - tion of them seems to suppose an absurdity or even only some singularity, for this is quite as senseless as to admit them without discussion and examination.

In every primitive word, the parallelism of the physical and moral relations is established upon the same radicals. Every word carries with itself its material and sensual definition, and this living language is as perfect and true as it is simple and natural in the man-creator. Let the Seer express, with the same word slightly modified, the Sun, Day, the Light, Truth, and applying one and the same epithet to the white Sun and to a lamb, let him say Lamb or CHRIST instead of Sun, and Sun in lieu of Truth, Light, Civilization—there is no allegory in this, but true relations, seized and expressed with inspiration. But when the children of the night say, in their in - coherent and barbarous dialect, Sun, Day, Light, Truth, Lamb, the scientific relation so clearly expressed by the primitive word is effaced and disappears, and by simple translation, the Lamb and the Sun become allegorical beings, symbols with lost meanings. The Seers used the same inspired radical to express nourishment and instruction. Is not the knowledge of the Truth the nourishment of souls? Thus, the roll of papyrus or biblos eaten by the Pro - phet Ezekiel; the little book which an angel causes the writer of the Apocalypse to eat; the feasts of the magical palace of Asgard, to which Gangler is invited by Har the Sublime; the marvelous multiplication of seven small loaves, related by the Evangelists of the Nazarean; the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. living bread which CHRIST gives his disciples to eat~ say - ing, “This is my body,” and a great number of incidents like these are a repetition of the same allegory; the Life of Souls, which are nourished by the Truth; the Truth, which without diminution multiplies itself, augmenting, on the contary, in proportion as it is fed upon. Exalted by a noble sentiment of nationality, dazzled by the idea of an immense revolution, there arises a Revealer of occult mysteries, who strives to popularize the discoveries of the antique Science among men, rude, ignorant, innocent of the most simple elementary no - tions. Let him say, for example, “The earth turns; the earth is round like an egg.” What can the barbarian do who hears him, except to believe? Is it not evident that every proposition of this kind becomes for him a dogma from on high, an article of faith? And is not the veil of a scientific allegory sufficient for him to make of it a Mystery? Consider only how little you know upon the evidence of your own senses, or by reason and analogy, and how much of what you call your knowledge is what you only believe? In the schools of the Seers, the terrestrial globe was represented by an egg of pasteboard or painted wood; and when the little children were asked, “What is this egg?” they answered, “It is the earth.” Children of larger growth, the barbarians, hearing"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"90 ~~T!.FICEX DEGREE. that, repeated, after the children of the Seers, “The world is an egg.~~ By that they meant the physical and material world, and the Seers meant the geographical’ and ideal world, the image-world, created by the Spirit and the Word. In fact the Egyptian Priests represented the Spirit, In - telligence, Kneph, with an egg upon his lips, the better to show that the egg was but a comparison, an image, a manner of speaking. The Hindu philosophers have explained in the same manner the golden egg of Brahma, the mundane egg from the two halves of the shell whereof the heaven and earth were fashioned. The symbols of the Sages become the idols of the vulgar; the allegories and myths of the wise, the fictions of history. The Indo-Aryans of the Panjab, sacrificing, produced the sacrificial fire by attrition of a pointed stick held upright, and a flat piece upon the ground; and the Vedic poet said, ‘The Fire, Agni, is generated, and as soon as born he devours his parents,’ and these two ‘parents’ became at last the Lingam, the male and female organs united, an object to be worshiped for thirty centuries by a whole race numbering millions, which still worships it to - day.

The Seer, the Initiate, the Elect of Nature and of the Supreme Reason, is the Great Man, the Priest and King. To him alone belong Light, Science, the Truth, because confining his imagination to its proper second - ary place, he never allows it to gain the mastery over his reason and that natural logic which results from the com - parison of ideas, because his ideas grow, multiply, ex - tend, in the same proportion as his necessities, and the circle of his knowledge expands by degrees, without any intermixture of false judgment and erroneous deduction. To him alone belongs that intuitive sagacity which enables his intellect to reach and pass at a bound, and without any process of formal logic, the goals which others slowly struggle to attain and never reach, by which his conclusions are always sound and wise and his judg - ment unerring. This sagacity, so wonderful to the many, has been the secret of the power of those who have been styled Magicians. It is a portion of the Absolute Light and infinitely progressive. The power of the will is in exact proportion with it, and therefore the reach and scope of that power are also indefinite, that is, without known limits. Few such men arise in any age, and long intervals elapse between them.

When such men fail and fall, it is because other forces sometimes govern them than Reason and Justice alone, in other words, because they are not the Deity, Who alone is Absolute Reason and Absolute Justice. Above and before all that is agreeable or apparently profitable, there is always a Truth, that is to say, a Reason, and by this Reason all human actions ought to be guided, and not by considerations of gratification or advantage, if we desire to enlarge in ourselves that intelligence which is the reason-of-being of immortality, and to make nearer perfection that justice which is the reason-of-existence of law. The man who is truly a man can will that only which reasonably and justly he ought to will; wherefore he silences his lusts and fears, that he may hear Reason alone; and this is a chief object of Magism and the Hermetic philosophy, as it is also the secret of power. The Egyptian initiations were perpetuated, while enfeebled, in the secret societies of the Middle Age. Christian radicalism, based on a false interpretation of this text: “You have but one Father and one Master, and you are all brethren,” struck a terrible blow at the Sacred Hierarchy. Thereafter, Sacerdotal dignities became the fruit of intrigue or chance; active mediocrity supplanted modest and therefore unacknowledged superiority; and meanwhile, initiation being an essential law of the religious life, as the “Secret Discipline” among the earliest Christians strikingly shows, a society instinctively"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"LEG ENDA. 93 magical was formed at the time of the decline o~±e Pen - tifical power and soon concentrated in itself alone all the power of Christianity, because it alone, though compre - hending it vaguely, exercised positively the Hierarchical power, by the tests of initiation, and the omnipotence of Faith, in passive obedience. The more dangerous and terrible the ancient initia - tions, the more they were efficacious; wherefore the world then had men to govern and instruct it. The Sacerdotal Art and the Royal Art consisted chiefly in trials of the courage, discretion and will of the neophyte. It was a novitiate like that of the priests now so unpopular under the name of Jesuits, and who would again govern the world if they had a truly wise and intelligent head. The Candidate, in the ancient initiations, surrendered without reservation his life and liberty to the Masters of the Temples of Thebes or of Memphis; he advanced resolutely amid innumberable terrors that might well lead him to suppose that it was intended to take his life. He passed through fire, swam torrents of dark and foam - ing water, was suspended by frail ropes over bottomless gulfs. Was this not blind obedience, in the fullest sense of the word? To surrender one’s liberty for the moment, m order to attain a glorious emancipation—is not this the most perfect exercise of liberty itself?

Life is a warfare in which one must prove himself a man to ascent in rank. Force is not given. It must be siezed. The intellectual and social chaos, in the midst of which we perish, has for its cause the neglect of initiation, of its tests and its mysteries. Men, in whom zeal overpowered knowledge, have believed in the primitive and absolute equality of men. The essential law of nature, that of in - itiation by labors, and of dangerous, toilsome and volun - tary progress has been fatally disowned. Masonry, like Catholicism, has had its deserters. The result is the Level of Steel, substituted for the intellectual and symbolic Level. To preach equality to that which is below without teaching it how to rise is to pledge yourself to descend. To rebuild society, shattered and decayed, we must reestablish Hierarchy and Initiation. The task is difficult and arduous, but all the intelligence of the world sees the necessity of undertaking it; and this is the great purpose of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Woe unto it, if it be found unequal to its mission! The reign of Superstition has begun and must endure until the time when the true religion shall be established on the eternal bases of the Hierarchy in three degrees, and of the triple power which the ternary exercises, fatally or providentially, in the three worlds.

Want of Faith is the epidemic of the present century. The men of intellect, the High-Priests of the natural and physical sciences, the Statesmen and the Hierarchs of the Priesthood, are notoriously Infidels, that is, men without Faith, profes - sing to be guided by Reason alone and deeming Faith and Reason to be hostile to each other. And on the other hand, where Faith prevails, it is divorced from Reason and diseased, until, the more absurd a doctrine, the more dreamy a theory, the more impudent a pretence to super - natural gifts, the more readily it gains credence and founds a sect. It is literally the return to chaos and to anarchy, which, unless the evil be speedily corrected, must lead to the annihilation of the human race, as GOD has often heretofore, at the great geological epochs, destroyed with a breath whole races of animated crea - tures that now only remain as fossils to be studied by Science. Credulity exists, more abundant than ever in the world, but True Faith is rare. Impostors find ready credence, while to the true Adept few care even to listen. A new age of miracles has begun, but the miracles are vulgar, with - out purpose, and easily imitated by fraud.

The agent, whose invisible force so draws the needle, is as far beyond the jurisdic - tion of the senses, and as immaterial, as the will of man is. When we see the needle, balanced on its pivot, turn amorously to the North, we know that there is an unseen agent, acting everywhere on the earth’s surface, that thus draws round and holds fast the needle; and then by analogy we reason that this agent will produce other ef - fects, by means of the same force, and we can divine what some, perhaps many, of those effects will be. Faith and Reason are subject to the universal law of Equilibrium. Contrary in their natures, they are not hostile to each other, and the man or people that acts on the theory that they are so, by ignoring either, treads the downward path to perdition. The French Revolution ended in despotism as it began in bloodshed and glided into anarchy, because it repudiated Faith and adored Reason alone. The Church of Rome disowned Reason and enthroned a blind Faith, which at once degenerated into imbecile credulity; and it is known to what depths it and the countries that wore its yoke had fallen. Movement and life consist in the extreme tension of the two forces. Let each exactly equal the other, and we have immobility and death.

Unlimited and Infinite Power, if the only at - tribute of Deity, would have no bounds set by Reason and Justice and might change the law of Right and Wrong. It is the opposite of Wisdom, but from the equilibrium of the two, Beauty and Harmony result. Christianity substitutes LOVE for Wisdom.

The regularity of their move - ments is mathematical, because the equilibrium is perfect, but man is free to err, that is, to wander, either from the light of Truth or from the excellence of Virtue. These errors, in their turn, are the cause, occasion and reason of excellence and heroism, in himself and others, and therefore necessary. The Divine Reason, which is one, maintains the eternal equilibrium between the con - trary forces of nature, between Light and Darkness, and Good and Evil in the Universe, but the equilibrium in man must be maintained by himself; and therefore, in him, one scale or the other often preponderates, either too long or altogether.

Of Liberty is born the immortality of man, and the will of GOD puts in operation the laws of the Eternal Reason. Equilibrium in ideas is wisdom, in forces power. It is most exacting. When the law is observed, it exists; when the law is violated, how slightly soever, it no longer is. Hence it is that nothing is useless or lost.

The simultaneous emancipation and absolute equality of all men suppose the cessation of progress and consequently of life.

This is “All things,” says the philosophy of the Magi, “and outside of it there is nothing. No substance has issued forth out of absolute nothing. All that is has drawn its origin from a source of eternal Light, from GOD.” The Deity is comprehensible only in his manifestation; the non-manifested is for us an abstraction.

The invisible GOD was forgotten, with all the spiritual agents that execute his will, and the Stars and elements themselves were elevated to the rank of Deities. The Ancient Persians adored one eternal Principle of Good, one eternal beneficent GOD. Their creed said: “He is First, Incorruptible, Eternal, Unbegotten, without parts, unlike to all other beings.” “The Chaldeans,” says a Greek writer, “think there is one Principle of all things,” and Eusebius shows that they acknowledged a First and Supreme Being, the GOD, Father and King of all things. “The Persians,” Ibn Shahna says, “after the time of Zoroaster, asserted the existence of GOD the Creator, who was alone, without any companion. He created Light and Darkness; Good and Evil are produced out of the mixture of Light and Darkness; if these were not mixed, the world could not exist, and they will continue so to exist until they shall be placed in separate worlds appropriated to each. Between the Principle or God of Good, Ormuzd, and Ahriman, the Principle or God of Evil, was Mithras, whom they called the Mediator,” thus recognizing the Ternary and the equilibrium of two contraries. “Light and Darkness,” said Zoroaster, “are the world’s eternal ways. GOD is the Principle of everything that exists, the Generator of all Beings, Eternal, Immov - able, Self-Existent. There are no bounds to His power. He"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"108 TWENTY-EIGHTH DEGREE. is the Infinite mind and Supreme Intelligence.” But you should know that whatever is commonly reputed to have been said by Zoroaster was in reality not said by Zarathustra, but was written by some one at a much later day. The utterances above quoted as his are not to be found in the letter or the spirit, in the Gathas which he composed and which are included in the Zen - davesta. Ormuzd, also, is a corruption of the name Ahura Mazda, and Ahriman of Anra-Mainyu. Mithras was Mithra, the Vedic Mitra, not spoken of at all by Zarathus - tra, but only in the much later works of the Zendavesta. That he was the mediator between Ormuzd and Ahriman was a notion that made its appearance when Zarathustra had been dead for centuries. He was at first the Morning- Star and afterward the Sun. “Wisdom,” say the old Hebrew books, “had flowed forth from Eternity, from the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth.” “When He prepared the Heavens, I was there; when He described a circle in the ocean of light” And the word rendered “Wisdom” means the Gen - erative Intellectual Potency of Deity. This Wisdom, the daughter of GOD, is also Male and Generator. “She is the out-breathing of the Potency of GOD and a perfect influence flowing forth from the glory of Omnipotence.~~ “For she is the out-shining of the Eternal Light, the perfect mirror of the Power of GOD and the image of his Beneficence.” “He has formed earth by his Power and established it"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 109 by his Wisdom and stretched out the Heavens by his Understanding.” Such were the ancient ideas in regard to Deity. You will hereafter become more fully acquainted with them in the kabalah, whose dogma is that of the Hermetic Philosophers and the Magi. Our Masters have said that Human life is composed of these three phases or successive transformations—Birth, Life, Death, followed by immortality. The immortality of the Soul, necessitated as the completion of the Quater - nary, is Kabalistically proven by analogy, which is the single dogma of the truly universal religion, as it is like - wise the key of Science and the inviolable law of Nature. Death can no more be an absolute end than birth is a real beginning. Birth proves the preexistence of the human being, since nothing is produced from nothing, and death proves immortality, because existence can no more cease to be than nothing can cease not to be. To say that the world came forth from nothing is to propose a monstrous absurdity. Everything that Is proceeds from that which was, and consequently nothing of that which is can ever not be. The succession of forms is produced by the Alternations of movement. These are the phenomena of life, which succeed without destroying each other. Everything changes, but nothing perishes. Forms, even the most mobile, are immortal and subsist always, in the permanence of the reason for their being."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"110 TWENTY-EIGHTh DECREE. Such are some of the doctrines of Masonry in this degree. Do you still ask if it has its secrets and mysteries? It is certain that something in the Ancient Initiations was regarded as of immense value by such Intellects as Herodotus, Plutarch and Cicero. The Magicians of Egypt were able to imitate several of the miracles wrought by Moses, and the Science of the Hierophants of the mysteries produced effects that to the Initiated seemed Mysterious and supernatural. The grand magical arcanum is figured by all the Sym - bols of Science and closely connected with the single and primitive dogma of Hermes. In the book ascribed to him is to be found the key of all the Magical allegories. It may be called the keystone of the whole edifice of the occult Sciences, and around it the unnumberable legends array themselves, which are either its partial translation or its commentary, incessantly renewed under a thousand dif - ferent forms. The fabulous history of the Golden Fleece is the summary, while veiling them, of the Hermetic and magical doctrines of Orpheus. The Thebaid is an astounding synthesis of the whole dogma, present, past and future, an infinite fable which touches at once, like Orpheus, the two extremes of the cycle of human life. The seven gates of Thebes, defended and attacked by seven chiefs, who have sworn on the blood of one victim, mean the same as the seven seals of the sacred book explained by seven Genii, and attacked by a monster with seven heads, after being opened by the living and immolated Lamb, in the Allegorical book of Saint John. ~iEdipus"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 111 wars against his father and without knowing him slays him— tremendous prophecy of the third emancipation of reason without Science.

Nature solicits us, for the well-being of Humanity, to reconstitute the great sympathetic and religious chains which once bound men together. Sympathy is a myster - ious instinct which unites human beings together, em - braces with equal force reason and folly, good and evil, and diminishes the merit of Virtue as well as the crim - inality of Vice. Self-interest is that which divides and dissevers them, and no society of men can long endure, whether civil, political or religious, the individuals of which are governed by it, the attraction of sympathy among them being wanting.

Sympathy produced the Crusades; and then, as always when it exists in its highest degree, it produced, in those on whom it acted, a loss of all power over the will and that mental bondage which has been more often used for evil purposes than for good. The dancing mania in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, in the 14th and 15th centuries; the convulsions by which multitudes were affected, in England and France, in the 18th and early in the 19th; the religious ecstacies, swoonings and spasms of later days in America; the child-pilgrimages of the middle ages, in the chief of which, in the year 1212, more than thirty thousand boys gathered around a shepherd-boy in France who claimed to be an ambassador from the LORD: the people knelt to him as a Saint who performed miracles, new child-prophets arose and led whole armies to him of the children of persons of all ranks, and seven large shiploads sailed from Marseilles to Palestine—all these were caused by that wondrous sympathy which binds the human race together and proves it to be unit and, as it were, a single individual.

This mighty agent, like the other powers of Nature, may be used for good as well as for evil, by the Magus as well as by the Sorcerer. The Ancient Hierophants knew its value, and it has always been the bond of union of all secret societies and occult associations. The Magus is the Sovereign Pontiff of Nature, possessed of the traditional knowledge of her secrets and using a force which he knows to attain power over other men. When the man of genius discovers a real law, he possesses thereby an invin - cible force of action and direction. He may die in the work, but what he has willed is accomplished despite his death and often by means of his death. A great action always prepares an equal reaction, and the secret of great successes is wholly contained in the fore-knowledge of reactions.

Omnipotence will not permit selfishness to reign supreme forever. An association of men, using the great magical agent, Sym - pathy, and themselves inspired by profound Faith and earnest sincerity, with an indomitable will and courage, may do so. In religion, universal and hierarchical orthodoxy, restoration of the Temples in all their splendor, reestab - lishment of all ceremonies in their primitive pomp, hierarchical teaching of symbolism—mysteries, miracles and legends for the children, light for the grown men who will be careful not to give offense to the little ones in their simplicity and belief—this is the desire and need of humanity. Philosophically, everything exists by knowledge. To know is to be. Science and its object become one in the intellectual life of him who has knowledge. To doubt is not to know.

To religion should be left the liberty of its infinite aspiration, but it, in its turn, should leave to Science the rigorous conclu - sions of absolute experimentalism. Man is the child of his works. He is what he wills to be; he is the image of the GOD whom he creates for himself; he is the realization of his own ideal. If his ideal wants basis, the whole edifice of his immortality falls. Philosophy is not the ideal, but it should serve as basis for the ideal. The Known is for us the measure of the Unknown; the Visible enables us to appreciate the Invisi - ble; the sensations are to the thoughts what the thoughts are to the aspirations. Science is a celestial trigonometry; one of the sides of the absolute triangle is Nature, sub - mitted to our investigations; another is our Soul, which embraces and reflects nature; the third is the Absolute, in which our Soul expands. Atheism is no longer possible because we no longer pretend to define GOD.

The existence of evil and suffering, at the same time that GOD is all-wise and perfectly beneficent, and the co - existence of his Omnipotence and Omniscience and the moral accountability of man, have in all ages been the rocks on which philosophies and religions have made shipwreck. Whole nations have held it blasphemy to say that GOD is the author of Evil, and the idea is not easily dismissed that a world not all good and always happy is imperfect and unworthy of a Perfect GOD, unless there is to be compensation in another life. But the Holy Writings expressly say that GOD has created the Evil as well as the Good, and it is for us to reconcile this and the punishment by Him of iniquity and wrong with His MI-knowledge, All-power and Infinite Beneficence. For we are conscious that in doing wrong we exercise our free will; we know that suffering is, by GoD’s ordinance, the consequence of vice, its consequences often descending to our children; and Logic asks us if it is not true that man can do nothing contrary to the will of GoD?—if HE did not fore-know and intend that we should do the wrong? And if so, why He should punish us?"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"120 TWENTY-EIGHTH DEGREE. It is said to be an unsatisfactory doctrine that GOD was compelled by necessity to create Evil with the Good and that it is virtually a system which teaches that GOD was forced to create a Devil. The Devil was created by human imagination, because man considers pain, sickness, hardship, toil and oppres - sion as wrongs inflicted on him, to atone for which it is necessary that there should be another world in which all this is to be remedied and where virtue is to be rewarded and vice and wrong punished. But if pain, torture, starvation and untimely death are wrongs and the cruelties of GOD, when inflicted on us, are they not equally so when inflicted on the harmless lamb or bird, the intelligent dog or horse? Why is it one of the Commands of the Law of Moses, ‘Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its Mother’s milk’? Are not cruelties perpetrated on animals wrong and reprehen - sible and evidences of a cruel, heartless nature in man? It is owing to human vanity that no man has ever dared to reason with common sense on this subject. Man pur - sues, tortures and kills the most innocent animals, birds, and fishes to gratify his appetite or for mere pleasure. He crushes thousands of insects without a thought of wrong; nay, he destroys, as does every other animal, myriads of animalcul~ and infusoria daily, unconsciously and without being able to avoid it.

It would be impossible for Omnipotence to continue mane s existence in a world so teeming with life. Universal death would become a necessity. Air, earth and water would be all animalcul~, and the myriads of noxious insects would make human life an impossibility. The plan of creation is that one creature shall serve as food for another, and without this law, living creatures could not exist and increase. What we term Evil, therefore, was necessary, and GOD was compelled to create it, or not to create at all; for everything below Himself must be imperfect, and imper - fection is the intermingling of Evil. To give bodies to human beings, bodies capable of receiving the impres - sions that cause pain, bodies with sensual appetites and provoking sensual passions, it was necessary that the creature so constituted should be imperfect. To dream of perfection in the body is a simple absurdity. A milenium on earth is impossible.

To Him the notes of that har - mony return and mingle with the mighty diapason of the spheres and are immortal. We cannot escape the conclusion that it is impossible for Man to do anything not intended by the Deity. To hold that we can contravene His will is to deny His Omni - potence. We are thus forced to a belief in Fatality or Predestination; and yet our consciousness, which is higher evidence than Logic, and Reason, which tells us that otherwise GOD would be unjust, that is, would not be, concur in proving to us our Free Will or Liberty.

It ignores all immaterial influences and forces and refers all cause and effect in Nature to material laws and chemical forces.

Religion, in direct opposition to the nonsense of modern Science, represents the Deity as everywhere present, within us and without, and therefore directly and immediately acting in all the operations of Nature, and yet, with singular inconsistency, it prays to Him as “Our Father,” that is, our Generator, “Who art in Heaven.” Inquire of your own mind, and you will admit that you habitually conceive of GOD as a Being at a distance, not present with and within you. You constantly replace a present Deity with the Laws of Nature and the Forces of matter. What are the forces of matter? Can you conceive that matter, of itself, is possessed of or generates any forces unless inertia be one? The forces of matter are forces of the Deity, acting through matter. Analyze matter and see if you can discover the vital force and the force of growth, the attraction of gravitation or cohesion? According to Religion, GOD everywhere frames every minute infusorium as carefully as the first one to which He communicated life. Every leaf and every blade of grass is framed by His hand, and there is no middle ground between this and the theory of His total absence from the Universe, wherein the laws of Nature take His place.

Man has made GOD after his own image. When he does not assign to the Deity of his imagination his own bodily members and organs, he invests Him with his moral qualities, his mental and intellectual powers. How are we warranted in assigning to Him any of these? Why should the creature assign his created attributes and powers to the Creator? We possess five senses and can conceive of no others. If Sight had not been given us, we could form no conception of that sense. Omnipotence may have created, in this or some other sphere, races of beings with senses wholly different from ours. Elsewhere there may be matter with other qualities that those of the matter known to us; and there may be many Entities that are neither matter nor non-matter, though we can conceive only of matter and nothing, or the void.

Forces, light, electricity are, but do not exist. They are like thoughts and the sensations of pain and pleasure. To be and to continue are not to exist, that is, to live. The Will is not a Being, and yet it is a power. Existence can be predicated only of combinations of matter. We can con - ceive of no existence of the Soul separate from the body. This is not the mere envelope and instrument of the Soul, and still less a clog upon it, or its enemy. They are wedded together and form one, and this union constitutes existence. Hence some of the ancient philosophers denied that even existence could be predicated of the Deity. The Very Deity, they said, is but does not exist. Existence, they said, is succession of phenomena in time; but with the Deity, all is simultaneous, and the IS, the WAS and the SHALL BE are one. May it not be that GOD and the Universe are one, and that He exists only in connection with it?

And in terming GOD the Absolute Reason, we assign to Him no intellectual faculty of our own, since Reason is as independent of us as Truth is. Light, Vitality and Electricity, supposing the latter to include Magnetism and Galvanism, are the mightiest agents of the Deity known to us in Nature. How far their essences are independent of each other and distinct, we do not know. Light, at least, by the common consent of all ages and men, is the most apt symbol of the Deity Himself, and therefore we use the symbol, by means of the great Light of our Council, which represents the Sun. Over each of the three candlesticks which stand near the Altar is the letter S.

It is not the babble of fools or the incoherences of the insane. The Kabalah is from beginning to end a succession of sym - bols, the meaning of which was not meant to be easily penetrated, and the writings of the Alchemists are still more enigmatical.

The Balance, in Masonic symbolism, is often associated with the Key. It is in your power to unlock the Secrets of Masonry. The rest depends on yourself.

IT is not necessary, at this day, to enlarge upon the necessity of study and the importance of knowledge. For knowledge alone gives men power; it alone enables a man to be useful and makes him necessary to the community. Little can be expected from an ignorant man. He is always ready to be the dupe of the artful and cunning and to become their servant. Prejudice and error always hold him in bonds. The well-informed man only is really free. Education expands his intellect, enlarges his mind and bears him, as it were, to the very steps of the Throne of Eternal Truth. He sees, he understands, he knows. Upon his eyelids shines the True Light, the light of Knowledge, Truth, Philosophy. He may be to his Brethren a teacher and a gnide. Even in the General, it is his shining civil qualities that command the respect of the rudest soldiery. The ignorant man is blind, goes staggering all his life in the dark, serves Imposture and Tyranny, bears the burdens they impose on him and is ever ready to be their instrument to enslave his Brethren and to remove out of the way of his Masters those who seek to elevate the enslaved above their present condition.

One may be a true Knight Kadosh, as he may be a Statesman, an Orator, an Advocate, without stu - dying Logic or Rhetoric at all and certainly without being an adept in Music, Geometry or Astronomy. The seven Sciences of Pythagoras would not now be named as constituting the circle of human knowledge. Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic and Arithmetic are dethroned as Sciences, and have become but the preparatory studies of youth in schools and academies, while Geometry, Music and Astronomy have made such advances, that to attain eminence in either demands the whole of a man’s time and life.

The first study of each would be himself. He would find himself thinking. Seeing others like himself, he would wonder if they also thought. A thousand things would im - pel him to communicate his thoughts. A thought is in - tangible, not cognizable by any of the senses. How shall it be communicated to another? The desire of indulging an appetite, and some of the passions and feelings could be expressed by gestures—the desire to eat, for example, because that is a desire to do an act by means of par - ticular organs of the body—hatred, because the act of repelling or beating would be evidence of ill-will. To go beyond this, language would be invented. Words, which are but arbitrary sounds combined and modified, would be agreed on, to represent, either singly or together, not only objects, but mental operations, arguments, deductions—in short, the invisible, intangi - ble thoughts. We easily see how men could agree on a sound that should stand for a particular part of the body, a par - ticular object. But more than that would be necessary. Before men could argue, conclude or agree, in regard to anything beyond visible objects, they would have to settle among themselves the precise meaning to be attached to a vast number of words not the representatives of visible objects. Take ‘‘Thought,’’ ‘‘Perception,~’ “Imagination,” “Good,” “Bad,” “Law,” and the like as examples.

The value of this communication depends upon its ac - curacy. If we agree on a word or phrase as expressing the same idea to each of us, when in reality my idea, which I endeavor to express by it, is not your idea, which you try to express, and think you express by it, neither of us really expresses his idea at all. So far, there is really no language, but only unmeaning sounds—unmeaning, because their meaning is really not agreed on. Hence there will arise constant misunderstanding and disputes. Take, for example, in some Christian country, ten men of different degrees of intellect. Each believes that there is a GoD, the Creator and Ruler of the Universe. Yet, because to each the word “GoD” has a meaning different from that which it has to each of the others, they worship different Deities, one bowing down to Moloch, one to Baal, and perhaps of the whole ten not one to the true GOD. Again, the thought that is conceived in, or that comes, we know not whence, into the mind is transitory. It passes away and is forgotten. Not only to communicate it to per - sons at a distance is it necessary to find something, to agree on something that shall represent it to the eye, but it is also necessary to do so in order to perpetuate it, to be enabled to refer to it, to recall it even to ourselves, who originate and then forget it, and in order to make it exer -"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"138 DEGREE. cise any extended or continued influence. Here, again, the value of this representation of the thought is its ac - Cu racy. Besides that, words do not represent the same ideas, in all cases, to different persons (one reason for which is that we apply to mental phenomena and spiritual things words that have intrinsically material meanings); many words represent no ideas at all, but only vague and con - fused notions, or are wholly without any meaning whatever. Many such words are current in religion, metaphysics, philosophy and politics, the great fields of disputation of the World, and, of course, as to these words and their meanings, constant disagreements arise, to settle which is impossible. Out of these disputes as to words, and chiefly as to words without meaning, grow sects, schools, polemics, hatreds, persecutions and wars. GRAMMAR is the wonderful gift and science of accurately communicating to other minds, through the medium of the ear or eye, by language or writing, the thoughts that come into our own mind and of so recording them with exact accuracy, by symbolic characters that conven - tionally represent them, as that these characters shall always recall to us and others the self-same thoughts and ideas with all their more delicate shades and colorings.

For our thousand persons to act together, to combine, to form a society, make laws, establish a government, nay, even to refrain from destroying each other and to live in peace, some of them must sway, move, impassion, excite, stir, persuade the others. The mind of one must take fire at the mind of another. The thoughts of one must exer - cise a power over the thoughts and will of another.

With a little experience the Future would become iinpor - tant to them, the alternations of Day and Night, the Seasons, the changes of the Moon, the revolutions of the Sun, the number and movements of the Planets. By far the most important of all things to them would be the regular return of Spring. Certain numbers would thus become particularly noticeable. The day of twenty-four hours would represent the unit. The year of twelve moons, divided each into four weeks, to agree with the changing figure of the moon, would give them the number seven, agreeing with the number of the planets. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn would make the number 5 sacred, and the three beneficent seasons, Spring, Summer and Autumn, the number 3. The months of these seasons, nine in number, would sanctify the square of 3. Geometrical figures—the circle, point, triangle, five-pointed star, the cube, the triple triangle, the seal of Solomon, the three squares of the 47th problem—would soon become symbols of the mysterious numbers. Hence the idea of “intellectual numbers,” ex - isting in the Deity before anything was created, of numbers as unconnected with any object and having in themselves a peculiar virtue and potency, of which so much was said in the philosophy of Pythagoras. Thus men, going a step further, a step beyond mental intercommunication with each other, began to commune"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"142 THIRTIETH DEGREE. with the universe around them, to reason as to cause and effect and to inquire into the mysteries of nature. Logic was soon found to be unsatisfactory, since it always ended in some insoluble difficulty or brought them to some im - pregnable obstacle; and mathematical demonstration seemed the only certainty, the only process that could rightfully demand the assent of all minds. To us the word Arithmetic means the Science of Mathematics and mathematical demonstration in physics and philosophy, and its numbers and figures were seen by the ancients in the heavens, written there in stars by the finger of GOD. It was a great advance in the direction of Truth. GEOMETRY. The Science of Mathematics, applied to the earth, which appeared to be and was supposed to be a great flat level with occasional inequalities, was termed GEOMETRY. The world, with the stars and other heavenly bodies that seemed made only to minister to it, became a great machine, subjected to and governed by certain mere mechanical forces, laws of unerring accuracy imposed upon it by Omnipotence. These laws and that mechan - ical, unvarying accuracy of movement demonstrated the existence of a single Omnipotent Will, and thus men ar - rived at the conviction that there was a Supreme Ar - chitect or Builder of the Universe, an incomparable Machinist, who had made the Universe as men make a clock, and having would it up and set it running, left it to go on of itself by the never-ending action and impulsion"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 143 of eternal Forces which He had impressed upon it. The unity of GOD, the Creation of the Universe or great World-machine by Him, and the certainty and im - mutability of the laws that govern its mechanical mo - tions, still another step toward the Truth, are the GEOMETRY of the Knights Kadosh. MUSIC. This system also was found insufficient. It gave no basis for the Moral Law. It accounted for nothing Spiritual, nor even for the phenomena of vegetation. It assigned to the Deity no moral motive for exercising the power of creation. It removed Him too far from the I Universe and annulled all sympathy between Him and His work. This Universe was foreign to Him, a machine manufactured by Him in which He could feel only that gratification which the workman feels in the product of his art and skill. Therefore men began to see, in the revolutions of the spheres all arranged so as never to interfere with each other, in the alternation of the seasons and of the hours for rest and labor, in the eternal genesis of living crea - tures, in the phenomena of growth, something more than the exercise of mechanical skill on the part of the Creator. They found that musical notes proceeded by oc - taves and were connected with, and could be represented by, numbers; they connected all musical sounds in nature with one universal harmony and imagined that the"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"144 THIRTIETH DEGREE. spheres, revolving in their orbits, made exquisite MusIc and thought that the law which made their movement eternal was not two opposing mechanical forces, but One law of Harmony, in which something more than the mechanical genius of the Deity played a part and was the lawgiver. They saw the same law of harmony in the nature of man, in the birth and death of things, in growth and in decay; and thus they connected all the phenomena of nature with the incessant movements of the Stars and made all these the result of that one law of Harmony, which sense the word Music has in this Degree—the Har - mony of Equilibrium, resulting everywhere from the op - posite action and tendency of contraries. ASTRONOMY. Still no sufficient motive was assigned why the Deity, after an eternity of immobility during which He had been alone with Time and Space, silent, speechless and inac - tive as they, should have been impelled to create; nor any in its nature so permanent as to give us guarantee that He might not at any moment become weary of His work and annul it when it should no longer give Him pleasure; nor any indeed at all consistent with the loftiness and in - finity of His perfection. Surely the gratification arising from the exercise of an even infinite mechanical skill and inventive capacity was not so; nor could the contempla - tion of the smooth and accurate working of a mere machine long give Him pleasure. And though of higher degree, the mere sensual delight which Harmony could"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 145 give would be in its nature the same. It is only in part in - tellectual, and in no degree moral. Man studied the mysterious of the great Universe. He invented the telescope and microscope, and that Universe unfolded itself to his rapt and wondering eyes. Infinite as the world above him seemed, he found a world as infinite below him, and the minuteness and magnitude of crea - tion equally unlimited. Everywhere he saw lfe, rioting in enjoyment; everywhere something adapted and designed to minister to the enjoyment of some living thing. With eyes unsealed, he studied again the great pages of the Book of Nature and sought to read the thought of the Creator written indelibly there and to discover the motive for creation and the great law of the Universe in the won - drous profusion displayed by the Almighty; and in the stars, thick as the leaves of great forests in the spring - time, in air, earth and water, teeming with life, in the greenness of the earth and the azure of the sky, in everything within him and without, he discovered that motive and that Law—the motive, infinite BENEFICENCE; the Law, infinite LovE; and he saw that, as the time never was when GOD was not, so the time never was when GOD was alone, with nought to love and care for, and when He had not created the Universe. ASTRONOMY is the religion of space, leading man through a starry peristyle, up to the religion of ideas.

After Philip’s death, the fallen Order, reviving under different names in different parts of Europe, labored to overthrow Royal Despotism and Feudal Oppression. After that of Clement, it sought to thwart the arrogant assumption of temporal power by the Popes and nurtured throughout Europe, among men of letters, poets and divines, the anti-papal spirit.

The day for the people to spawn tyrants had not yet returned. These, then, are, to us at least, the three Assassins of Human Freedom, of Liberty of Thought and Conscience — irresponsible autocratic power, sacerdo tal usurpation, and corporate monopolies and abuses that enrich privileged classes. The Templars made no issue with liberal and well-regulated government. They were not at first, nor are they now, the advocates of radicalism and unbridled popular license, itself the worst of tyrannies; but they do believe that a constitutional Monarchy or a well-regulated and safely-balanced Republic, based on an inviolable Constitution, expressing the will and having the assent of the people, is the only government to which a moral and enlightened human being ought to submit. Nor did they make war upon the religion of Rome. They wished only to see limits set to its extravagant claims to temporal power, its intolerable usurpations checked, the knife and actual cautery applied to its rank abuses, the right of private judgment in matters of faith asserted, and that of every man to worship GOD in such manner as his own conscience should dictate.

There is reason to believe that there was a secret schism between them and Rome and that their Johannite doctrines and their practice of the mysteries which they had learned in the East were the sole founda - tion for the charges of monstrous crimes and blasphemies brought against them, and so confidently alleged to have been fully established by testimony and confession. Des Paiens was learned in the esoteric doctrines and formulas of initiation of the Christians of the orient, and he was, say the Chronicles, clothed in 1118 with the Patriarchal power, in the legitimate order of succession of Saint John, who never went beyond the East, and whose doc - trines seemed more pure to the Templars than those of other Apostles, who, carrying the word of CHRIST to the remotest nations, conceded something to their manners and customs and allowed other rites to be practiced than those of the East. The Great Order naturally revolted against a Church which demanded of its members an absolute surrender of the reason as well as of the will. And it is quite probable that many of the Templars believed the Hermetic doc - trines and were even Pantheists. To many, perhaps, the Monotheism of the Kur’an seemed a more rational faith that Athanasianism. The race of Philippe le Bel no longer sits on the throne of France.

GOD has given us the Truth, my Brother, the TRUTH armed with which we are invincible. A special Truth, a great idea, is a power. It flatters no man, offers to serve no personal and private interest and then forbear its work, will be no man’s slave. It seems weak and impotent, as if some some self-constituted censor of the Press could blot it out forever. It is ready to perish. And now some startled tyrant or pampered priest has it in the dust and stamps it out! 0, idle fear! He could as easily stamp out the lightning. It is as invulnerable as GOD. Heaven and earth may pass away, but a Truth, never. It is immortal, unchangeable and cannot grow old. Every true word is endorsed by the Almighty, and all the armies of the world, and all the tyrants and priests and popular orators of the world cannot destroy or alter it. Not many years ago, the great leading Truth asserted in this degree began to be obscurely seen. “Man has natural empire over all institutions: they are for him, ac - cording to his development, and not he for them.” That seems to us a very simple statement, one to which all men everywhere ought readily to assent. But once, and that not very long ago, it was a great new truth. It has led to much. It made its way, feebly at first, confined to a few speculative heads. Then it began to get abroad; one taught it to another. It soon had philosophers to explain it, apologists to defend it, orators to set it forth, and by - and-by it got into the heads of the people.

The church gave way and recoiled before this truth. It had become a power and measured its strength with the church and worsted it. Afterward men saw its application to the temporal despotisms that had so long relieved men of the trouble of governing themselves and ruled them by virtue of pre - tended patents issued by GOD to certain families and in - dividuals. So soon as it gained foothold, revolutions followed thick and fast, in Holland, England, America and France, until it has inspired millions, built institu - tions, called a multitude of men into life; and one day all Europe and the world will be ablaze with that idea. Men opposed it: one of the Stuarts said, “It shall not cross the four seas of England,” but it crossed the Stuart’s neck, drove his children from the faithful soil and gave the throne to a foreigner, whose descendant sits upon it still. At first feeble, and strong with its own strength only, it has long ago got itself cannon and gunpowder and armies and ships of war, and has its flags, which it forces all the world to know and respect. At first destructive, it was destined to become creative and conservative. It came to America in company with those who fled from England and France across the wide Atlantic to escape persecu - tion, little knowing what fruit would come of their plant - ing; and lo! what institutions have sprung up on the soil then shaded by interminable forests and hideous with wild beasts and wilder men!

And now this great truth, long since recognized as true, and now by experience proved expedient and practicable, goes back over the sea, and earnest nations welcome it to their hearts—this sovereign truth: “MAT’i IS SUPREME OVER INSTITUTIONS: NOT THEY OVER HIM.”How it has startled the throned masters of Europe and how it still rings there in the people’s hearts!

Evil institutions alone have made them bad, and it is the duty of Masonry and of every Knight to aid in leading them back to the truth. For much still remains to be done. Tyranny is startled and weakened, but not overthrown. The chains still weigh on human thought and conscience. Monopolies and privileges, in the hands of favored classes, still impose burdens on the people. It is the old contest between Good and Evil, between the Sons of Light and the Children of Darkness, between Hercules and the giant Ant~us. The spirit of tyranny, in ambition, is immortal.

LEGEND A. The FIRST Degree shows you Man, such as Nature ha8 made him, with no other resources than his physical strength But each symbol and ceremony of Masonry has more than one meaning; one, enveloped, as it were, within the other; and all not developed or made known at once. The inmost meaning of the first degree shows you, in the Candidate, neither naked nor clad, barefoot nor shod, blindfolded and in bonds, penniless and destitute, the great dumb, inarticu - late masses of THE PEOPLE, blinded by Superstition, and de - fenseless through Ignorance, the body bound by the chains of Des’poti8m, toiling that it may pay tribute; and the soul in bonds to a church that has become a Hierarchy, and exter - minates Heretics in the name of a.

Be - fore then, he was half-naked, and half- clad, neither bare - footed nor shod, hail free-man and half sert As a Fellow-Craft, you were taught the necessity of ~owi 1 - EDGE, which alone can constitute man a king over creation and master over himself. So Masonry teaches the people, when once they have learned to stand erect, that there is a 3"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"4 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. GOD for them, as well as for the noble and the churchman; that by PRUDENCE, FORTITUDE, TEMPERANCE and JUSTICE, not by Rashness or Desperation, Excesses or a wild Revenge, they can become politically and spiritually free ; that in the Lodge there is an exemplar of free government; and that Masonry is the pure and primitive Religion. The THIRD degree, in its ceremony, and in the very name of RHIRUM, shadowed forth to you the great doctrine of another life and the immortality of the soul. And it also symbolized the people, raised from the DEATH of Vassalage and Ignoranet., to the LIFE of Freedom and Intelligence. As a MASTER MASON, you united yourself in stronger ties of Brotherhood with your fellows. Their lives became dear to you as your own. You could no longer do wrong to or speak evil of your Brother, nor allow private person, priest or potentate to wrong him, if it were in your power to prevent it. A new and stronger bond united you to your race; to the dignity of MANHOOD, taught in the first degree, was now joined the strength of BROTHERHOOD. There, that the people may fully appreciate the nobility of their own nature, and feel how base it is in them to remain buried in ignorance and spiritual bondage, they are taught by an impressive ceremony and symbolism, that their souls are immortal, and each the peer of every other soul that ever lived, if its equal in virtue and manly excellence. In the character of KHU1UM living, they are taught the dignity of labor, and that to work is not ignoble. And in Kxniux rising from the grave, they see Humanity, the Human race, once supine at the feet of Power Spiritual and Temporal, now rising triumphant from the sordid earth on which it groveled, and standing redeemed, the true and living image of its God. In the FOURTH degree, you commenced your ascent toward the Heights on which Truth, in Morals, Philosophy and Political Science, sits enthroned. Going back to the begin - ning of that instruction, the necessity whereof was indicated in the first degree, and its outlines hinted at in the second, in order to attain the result foreshadowed in the third, you received the first lesson—SECRECY, OBEDIENCE and FIDELITY."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 6 You were reminded that your duty and mission as a. Mason were to serve your fellows, your country and mankind: and the way was pointed out by which you might achieve that destiny. Those who have been long degraded and oppressed, are intoxicated with too large a draught of sudden freedom; and to secure Liberty as a permanent estate, they must ad - vance toward it by degrees, and by proper training be made fit for it, or it will prove an evil and not a blessing. You could only be fitted to receive the truths of Philosophy, by thorough instruction in morality, without which you would have been in great danger of falling into skepticism or sen - sualism. Masonic Light, like the light of day at the close of the long night in far northern climes, must come, not afl in one flash, but by slow and imperceptible degrees. As a Perfect Master, you were taught by the ceremonies Lhere performed, what is the most excellent reward of human virtue—the approbation of good men, and the regret for our death, of those whom we have served and benefited. You were there reminded to do that which is right, because it is right, and to regard the gratitude of the people as the most glorious civic crown of virtue. You were reininded that the good man makes no one poorer, by himself becoming richer; that he receives nothing from any one without returning an equivalent, and takes no wages that are not his due; for that, without these virtues and industry and honesty, homely though the latter are, Liberty is naught and independence but a name. In the SIXTH degree you were taught the excellence of dis - interestedness and generosity: that the performance should never fall below the justly entertained expectation; and that it is the mission of Masonry, and the duty of every true Mason to heal dissensions and differences, and restore Peace, Concord and Harmony among men. For kings both usurp and retain power, by means of hatreds and quarrels between nations and factions; and spiritual despots rest their rehi - gious domination most securely on the intolerance which they always assiduously cultivate. In the SEVENTH degree you were especially charged to be"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"6 THIRTY-SECOXD DEGREE. JUST, without which no man is fit to be free: to prevent the commission of wrong, and to punish wrong-doers; to judge impartially and mercifully, and to reverence the law, with - out which as a habit, and, as it were, a second nature, no people can long remain free. In the EIGHTH degree you were taught the rights of the laboring classes, and your duties toward them. It was especially impressed upon you that every laboring man is your Brother, entitled to your regard and assistance. In - culcating a generous sympathy for those who toil, and charging you in nowise to defraud the workman of any of his wages, nor to abandon him when the finger of God has stricken him with inability to ~vork, this degree embodies the great and noble creed of Human Brotherhood or Fra - ternity, without which there can be no genuine government of nations, except that of force and the sword. If the legends and ceremonies of the ninth and tenth de - grees were not symbolic and allegorical, they would be very unfit to constitute a part of Masonry. The dagger and the bloody head, and punishment inflicted by a private person without warrant and against the express mandate of the Ruler or the Law, have nothing in common with the teach - ings or spirit of Masonry; especially when this barbarous vengeance is taken upon a sleeping man.~ But when you learned that the Master, Khirflm, was the symbol of rational LIBi3alTY, physical, intellectual and spiri - tual, and that by his assassins were symbolized the Igno - rance of the people, ready when misled to cry aloud for the release of a malefactor and the crucifixion of their Wisest and Best; the Despotism of Tyranny, Oligarchy or Party; and the Intolerance of Fanaticism, Hypocrisy and Siqerstition, Po - liti~xzl and Religious; when by the very absurdity of the names assigned to these assassins, the allegorical character of the legend became transparent, then you saw that the raising of K~u~ symbolized the irrepressible vigor and force of the spirit of FREEDOM, which, however often crushed to earth, will still rise again; and that IGNORANCE in King - dom or Republic, not want of education, or inability to read,"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 7 write and cipher, but the not-knowing the Truth and Right, and accepting the error instead, the want of true Wisdom among the people, is a foe that must be extirpated and ex - terminated, to be overcome; that it can only be dealt with by beheading; while Tm4Y and SPnu¶ru.41 DESPOTISM may be fettered so as to be harmless. In these degrees you be - came pledged to the cause of true Freedom, of the PEOPLE as contradistinguished from the mob and populace; of Free Thought, Free Speech and Free Conscience; and in the eleventh degree you assumed the title of “A True Man,” and promised that none should repent relying on yoifr re - solves, your word, or your professions. In the same sense the people must be true, or free government will become anarchy or usurpation. In veritate et honestate salus Pc~puli. In the TWELFTH degree you were taught, that having ceased to work with the instruments of the LABOREE, the Square, the Levd, the Plumb and the Trowel, you had assumed those of the AItCHrrEc’r and GEOMETRICIAN; that you had advanced beyond right lines and angles; and, both points of the com - passes being above the square, had reached the mathematics of the heavens and the spheres; and thus you were given to understand that you were about to advance from the realm of morality into that of true Philosophy, and to deal with spiritual problems, as contradistinguished from those ma - terial ones which are represented by the working-tools of the Masonry of the Blue Lodges. You were thus approach - ing the threshold of the Holy of Holies, having hitherto been in the Middle Chamber only; and were about to begin to know what Masonry really is. In the THIRTEENTH degree you were not only solemnly de - voted to HONOR and DUTY, the two pole-stars by which every true Mason must always shape his course; but you saw the TRuE WORD of a Master Mason, and began to understand in what its value consists, of which its lost pronunciation is the symbol. You thought that a thin veil only hung be - tween you and the whole Truth and the perfect Light.

You have long since learned that you were only to receive so much of the truth as you were then capa - ble of receiving, and that the heights were still far above you. In the FOURTEENTH degree you were in part rewarded for your labors, by being made to understand the true nature and mission of Masonry as a moral and philosophical Teacher, the true nature of the Deity, and the nature and immortality of the human soul. These were explained to you, not in ac - cordance with the dogmas of a narrow sectarianism, claim - ing to be alone in possession of all the truth, but in such terms that all upright and intelligent men of every creed may assent to the great truths and splendid ideas embodied in the instruction of the degree. You saw shadowed forth the end of all the old mythic forms of Masonry, in which the ignorance of men had compelled it to envelop the truth, so as to be enabled to teach it. You saw foreshadowed, also, if your sight was keen enough, the future destiny of Masonry, involving the destiny of the Human Race; of man, prepar - ing to enter upon that heritage of Freedom and Fraternity, of Intelligence and Virtue, intended for him by his Heavenly Father, and to recover THE TRUE WORD, of free constitutional government, so long lost during the universal empire of ab - solute Rome and the Despotism of the Middle Ages, and of which Anarchy and Atheism are the deadliest enemies. By the degree of Perfection is symbolized. the PEOPLE, redeemed and enlightened, free in its obedience to law, all equal in rights in the presence of the law, 8.11 constituting one great Brotherhood, with common interests and common sympa - thies.

But still you were taught to look forward with HOPE and F&rrfl to the new day about to"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 9 ilawn fur I11,LIikiIId ; when all the dead dry husks of forms and ceremonial and empty traditions will drop away, to rot, and men will make simple Truth the test of all institutions; and when Reason and Intelligence will fearlessly follow it, to the annihilation of whatever idols and images, and the extinc - tion of whatever vain and unnourishing formulas it may lead. FmEunr to obligation, and CONSTANCY and PERSEVERANCE under difficulties and discouragement were especially incul - cated; and it is well for you always to remember that it is little to establish free institutions and constitutional govern - ment, unless they can be maintained. The price of liberty is not only eternal vigilance, but eternal loyalty to established forms, and eternal perseverance amid whatever discourage - ments; and no temptation, of fine theories or temporary necessity, must ever induce the leaders of the people to supersede the Constitution or subvert the Law in a given case; since, the dike once cut that holds back the inunda - tion, the breach continually widens, until the whole is swept away. In the 5IXTEENTH degree you were again, and more impres - sively, taught how difficult and almost impossible a thing it is to build the Temple of Liberty, when it has been over - thrown because of the loss by the people of THE TRUE WORD, the genuine spirit of manly and virtuous freedom. The Temple at Jerusalem was demolished by the Assyrian, be - cause the Hebrews had ceased to reverence the true 00(1, and offered incense to false idols; and this degree teaches us that an edifice so overthrown from turret to foundation- stone, is only to be rebuilt, and constitutional government reestablished, on the three great columns, the WISDOM of the Rulers, the STRENGTH of the People, and the HAItMONY of all interests; and only when new Architects worshipping THE TRUTH alone, in its simple and sublime majesty, with the SWORD of courage and the TROWEL of untiring labor, engage in the great work, and thus become the true Princes of the Holy City.

Soldier of Truth, every good Mason must regard himself as a pioneer, preparing the way for greater and better men who are to come after him; and always marching straight onward, he must unfalteringly follow the route which Truth indicates to every loyal man. Death alone must make him pause. Age gives no discharge from this service; and every true Mason may be certain that if he manfully toils and fights in this cause, he will, whether the effect of his labors be seen by his mortal eyes or not, leave to others who come after him a noble heritage, ever to increase as Mason fol - lows Mason in uninterrupted succession, until men shall succeed each other in this world no longer. In the SEvENTEENTH degree you saw in the remote Past the Essenes, whose doctrines John the Baptist preached in the Wilderness, wandering in the Desert in darkness, and wait - ing anxiously for the promised Light. These symbolized the human soul, weary of unprofitable speculation, a barren and diseased logic, and empty and soulless forms, setting out like the Candidate on his first journey from the West toward the East in search of the true Light or Masonic Philosophy that shall give him peace. The ancient and the modern metaphysics, which, after forty centuries of discussion, at most only admit the real existence of an external world, dis - tinct from ourselves and our thoughts, have often denied it, and have either never believed, or never had the right, ac - cording to their own principles, to believe it,—the philoso - phies of India and Greece, of Alexandria and the schools of Europe, are well symbolized by the desert shores of the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 11 Dead Sea, and by the darkness brooding upon its sluggish waters. In the EIGHTEENTH degree it was attempted to point out to you the way by which you might arrive at a solution of the great enigma of the Universe, and reconcile the existence of sin and wrong, and pain and suffering, the wretchedness of the good, and the prosperous fortunes of the wicked, with the theory of the unbounded and unwearying beneficence of God. In it you saw the first glimmerings of the Dawn; and learned at least to believe that this solution was possible. The rigid of the Deity to make beneficence a duty for us de - pends upon its being a law of His own Nature. Full as the Universe is of proofs of the Wisdom of God, it is equally full of evidences of His thoughtful care and love for all His crea - tures, in their adaptation for enjoyment, and in the means of enjoyment profusely supplied. Recognizing in the new Law of Love the simple and sublime expression of the Divine nature, man no longer trembles when he thinks of God, but looks up to Him with •child-like confidence in His infinite Love and infinite Mercy. He no longer believes it to be his duty to persecute his Brethren. He no longer desponds and sits sunken in de - spair, for the evils that swarm around him; and thus he can no longer be the instrument or the victim of Despotism and Hypocrisy. F 1 w~H and HOPE have made him strong and .self-rehiant; and he can become and continue FREE. Seeing in CHAPJTY that by means of which the whole hu - man family may become a unit, and in Intolerance the ready instrument by which Tyranny has always been enabled to perpetuate its usurped power, he learns civil and religious toleration, and ceases to regard with horror the founders of creeds other than his own. He wakes as from a dream, and looks back with amazement on the errors and prejudices that have so long blinded and bewildered him. Forget not these teachings, my Brother! For every man who endeavors to teach at all has a mission to perform. God tolerates him and allows him to teach, and we may well do the same. After all, the will of God governs, and the Doctrine that is"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"12 THIRflT-SECOND DEGREE. true will prevail; while what is false will rot. What is per - secuted grows; but if error be combated with no other weapons than those of Masonry, the total regeneration of Humanity will come in God’s good time. It is right to re - quire of a. man that he shall seek for the Truth, but not that he shall find it. We are expressly forbidden to judge; but not to love; and it’is not what we believe, but what we become, that is important to a man. When man is no longer a slave, we must appeal to his heart and intellect. There are no other means by which an intelligent man can be convinced, however lie may be compelled. Every one must of necessity assent to the falsehood which he takes to be true, and reject the truth which he takes to be afalsehood. In the NINETEENTH degree you were taught that the Human Intellect cannot measure the great circles of the designs of God; that with our feeble vision we see only an infinitesi - mal part of the great harmonious whole; that we hear only a single note of the great anthem whose duration is measured by Eternity. You were thus taught that the Human Race must wait with patience for the coming of the eternal reign of Good, when the feet of Truth, Honor and Charity shall have crushed the triple.’headed serpent of Falsehood, Base - ness and Intolerance. In the TWENTIETH degree you were taught how to govern and preside over your Brethren, when it should please them to select you to do so. And if you are or should be in- trusted with civil power, inherited or conferred, the same lessons, if faithfully observed, will crown your memory with honor, and cause your name to be remembered with grati - tude. The true Initiate is both King and Priest over the people. He cannot be deprived of these powers, though the mode of their exercise has changed. To influence men, by the pen or the voice, is to reign over them; to teach and instruct them is to be the real successor of the Hierophants and Magi; and the Adept now rules by means of influence and reason, better than the ancient possessors of regal and pontifical power did by means of terror and superstition. For this it is that"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"T.EGENDA. 13 Masonry has been called “Tue Royal and Sacerdotal Art;” and its form of government “a Hierarchy.” In the TWENTY-FIRST degree you were reminded by the ceremonial and legend how indispensable to Human Prog - ress is a free and independent judiciary. For it is not so much the right to vote, that m~kes a people free, as the right of free entrance into the Courts of Justice, where even the weakest may prefer his complaint against the most powerful, and demand and receive equal Justice ;—as inviolability of the rights of property and of personal liberty, secured by equal laws, and guaranteed by impartial tribunals, their tenure of office dependent neither on the will of Power, nor on the caprice of the Populace, but only upon the Law and the Constitution. In the TWENTY-SECOND degree you were .required to recog - nize the dignity of labor. For only when the people at large, and especially the young, recognize it to be true, that to work is not a curse inflicted by an angry God upon unwilling humanity, nor a disgrace, nor a misfortune, but a privilege, a blessing and an honor, will the laboring classes so appre - ciate their own value as to be capable of self-government, of gaining their freedom, and of maintaining it when gained. And while your vows as a Prussian Knight bind you to right the poor man when he is wronged or oppressed, as strongly as they pledge you to protect innocence and virtue, your obligation as a Prince of Libanus makes it one of your highest duties to elevate the people in their own esteem, by teaching them their rights, and their importance as Workers and the Architects of the national fortunes. In the TWENTY-THIRD, TWENTY-FOURTH and TWENTY-FWJ~H de - grees, you learned all that is known of the ancient Mysteries; and the origin and esoteric meaning of the Master’s Degree were explained to you. You heard the ancient doctrines in regard to the origin, nature and destiny of the Human Soul, its fall from its original state of perfection and purity, and the processes of its ultimate return. You were taught the ancient science of the stars, the meaning of many sym - bols; and that simple faith is wiser than vain philosophy;"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"14 TT-~Z~2~ DEORLE. that the commonest t1~ir~s in the Universe are profound mysteries to us; and thz~ the nature of God, the harmony of His attributes, and the existence and immortality of the Hu - man Soul, are no greater mysteries than those hidden in every blade of grass that grows, and in every needle that constantly points to the North. You heard the mythic utterances of the Kabalistic philoso - phy of the Hebrews, and were thus put in possession of the keys by which the true Initiate unlocks the secrets of the Universe. Whether these words of the Sphynx have mean - ings for you depends altogether upon your own intellect and industry. Like symbols, they conceal the truth, of which every Initiate must be a new discoverer. In any event, you cannot help but understand this—that since we are so incapable of comprehending the great mys - teries of material and spiritual nature, the Sectarianism must be idle and absurd which has for basis a difference in men’s catalogues of God’s attributes, and inventories of His per - sons, or in their notions as to the natures of His different emanations; or the observance or neglect of a particular Egyptian rite, the substitution of the symbol for the thing symbolized, of the ceremony for the spiritual act or change of which it is the emblem and the pledge; and the conse - quent adoration of the symbol or image, with sanctifying effect ascribed to the mere trivial or silly rite or ceremony. Thus you were impressively taught the wedded wicked - ness and folly of Intolerance and Persecution, and the neces - sity of gathering under one great Standard, upon one broad platform on which all can stand, the virtuous and intelligent of all nations and opinions, who believe in the two great tenets and only Articles of Faith of Masonry; to resist and defeat the constant encroachments of those who make barren theories paramount to the practical virtues, and persecute all who dare to assert their intellectual independence. In the TWENTY-SIXTH degree you saw shadowed forth the early Christian mysteries, and what were the doctrines of the Gnostics and the Kabala in regard to the Deity and His Emanations, and those of all the ancient nations in regard"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"L~aENDA. 15 to the Trinity. And above the uproar of all these dis - cordant doctrines you heard the calm voice of Masonry ut - tering these simple but sublime truths, which all men of all faiths may assent to: that God is Unity; that His Thought, formed in His Intelligence, and uttered in His Word, the WISDOM, expressed, and thus becoming STRENGTH, created the Universe, and preserves it by the eternal Law of HAIWoNY, which is the continued expression of His WaL; that the Soul of man is immortal, as his Thoughts are: that he is free to do evil or to choose good, necessity and liberty being perfectly in concord; and that all evil, wrong and suffering are but the discords that mingle with the concords of the Ijuiverse, to produce one great harmony. Becoming the soldier of Truth and Loyalty in the TWENTY- SEVENTH degree, as a Knight Commander of the Temple of Solomon, you received our final philosophical instruction in the TWENTY-EIGHTH, and thus advanced yet nearer toward the Light of which that degree especially treats. Whether that instruction is to be of value to you, depends upon yourself. The value of every creed and truth depends upon its being rightly understood; for every one is an enigma. Every creed is a vital truth in its earliest ages; but one becomes obsolete, and another arises. Each veiLs the Truth, and re - veals only glimpses of it. “Tlze letter killeth,” it is said, “but the spirit maketl4 alive.” We can now see the concealed truth in the old creeds, unknown to those for whom they were enacted, concealed under the letter, and symbolized in the formulas and ceremonies. There never could have been any actual efficacy or value in the burning of meat or incense upon an altar, or in circumcision; nor was there ever any truth in the literal sense of the declaration, “I am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.” The creeds of the past were the best that the men who then lived were capable of receiving. They were fitting for them; but as the world advanced, they became unfitting, and the new Law came—THE NEW LAW, which was hardly enun - ciated before it was misunderstood. The true Adept well"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"16 THIRTY-~L~n DEGREE. knows that to define the objeci of faith and circumscribe it, is to formulate the unknown. Professions of faith are the formulas of the ignorance and a~pirations of man. The man who denia, God, and the man who defines him, with a pre - tended infallibility, are equally fanatical. The error in all creeds is that they define the Deity by expressing everything that He is not. The Initiate, on the contrary, possessed of the key of analogy, which unlocks to him all the secrets of nature, and is the reason of existence of all revelations, knows that the work of God is the Book of God, and sees in what He has there written, the expression of His Thought, and consequently the manifestation of His Being, since we can conceive of Him no otherwise than as THE SuPREME INTELLECT. The succession of our degrees, and the intermingling or parallelism of those that are chivalric with those that are philosophical, show you that Masonry is practical, and re - quires that a practical use should be made of its philo - sophical speculations. None of its lessons are valueless. Everywhere it teaches us that the duties of life are to be done, and that we are to do them, everywhere doing away with the errors that infest the world, and supplying their places with truths radiant from Heaven. It is only thus, by constant labor in the daily walks of life, that we can come to rest in that Eden and New Jerusalem, the domain of Truth and Brotherhood, and see groveling at our feet the many false theories with which a practical Atheism, the exiling of a God of Love from the universe, has for so many ages afflicted the world, teaching men that it is a merit and duty to hate and curse and persecute one another. Thus only can the Knights Kadosh become the true soldiery of the Holy House of the Temple of Solomon, and Scottish Masonry be the Benefactor of mankind. It is• time that you should pause and reflect. We have briefly passed in review before you the principal features of"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"L&ENDA. 17 the first thirty degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, in the hope that all the details of their ceremonial and doctrine would thus present themselves freshly and vividly to your mind. It is now well for you to ask yourself whether these (legrees really have for you such an intrinsic value as you were led to believe they had while receiving them; or whether you have found, as in some other branches of Ma - sonry, that extravagant pretensions are to be contrasted with the most meagre performance; and that the whole is delusion and deception, insolvency with lying show of wealth. If you have been thus disappointed, our labor has been in vain. Whether these degrees have for you a real value depends upon your capacity to understand them, and upon the amount of study and the degree of reflection you have bestowed upon them. The wisdom that constitutes true in - tellectual wealth is not e3sily acquired. In these degrees, the Lectures, the Obligations, the incidental explanations, the opening and closing ceremonies, are all in unison, each word carefully weighed, and each meant to have effect. No man can understand them fully, without close and long 4udy, and profound thought. Often Me sentence is truly the .‘~ymbol that HIDES tiw meaning, or the hint that puts you upon the track of discovery. The symbolism of Masonry is not only a Sphynx, but a Sphynx nearly buried in the sand, which the envious centuries have heaped around it. To many men there is nothing of value or interest in philosophical speculation; as to many men there is ~no melody in music. These are natural incapacities that di.. minishi the value neither of music or philosophy. Of course, if it does not interest one to know what he is~ and what is to be his future destiny; if the existence of a. God, and the great mysteries of God’s omnipresence and of the creation by HIM, or outfiowing from HIM, of all that be - comes, are matters of indifference to him, as they are to the animals below him; if he cares not to comprehend the great and distressing enigma of the existence of Evil and Wrong, under the dominion of a God at once infinitely omnipotent and beneficent, or that of the co{~xistence of free will and"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"18 TamTY-S~~D DEGREE. necessity, then the interpretaiions which Philosophy endea - vors to give of these will be spoken to him in an unknown tongue. Every man best knows the worth of his own soul, and whether the questions of its immortality, of his liberty and responsibility, of its nature, origin and connection with God, are of any importance to him. For all to whom they are of none, the Philosophical degrees, of this Rite, will seem fool - ishness, and their Orphic sayings mere idle jargon. Such is the economy of Providence. A few only are fitted to be the Kings of Thought, the Masters of the Royal Se - cret, the Overseers over the Work; and these are generally patented by God and not by popular election. A few only, among the many, are gifted with the intellect that can en - able them to scale the heights of Science, Philosophy and Political Wisdom ; ‘and always and everywhere the Prophets of Baa] are more numerous than those of Jehovah. While Masonry remained in the hands of the select and wise few, it was a science and a religion. But it fell into other hands, and became what it is to the Multitude. Few Masons there now know the profound meanings of their symbols. The CoMrAssEs of the Grand Architect, and the SQUARE of Solomon, have in whole countries become the gross and material Level of an unintelligent Jacobinism, ex - pressed and realized by a Ti-iangle of steel. The Initiations of the ancient Mysteries have ceased; be - cause those fit to be initiated no longer finding Initiators, and the Hierophants or directors of consciences having long since become as ignorant as the masses that listen to their babble, the blind are weary of following the blind,’and no one is willing to submit to tests and trials that neither re - lieve from doubt nor save from despair. For all except a few, the Toad to the Iiight is lost. Ask yourself if you have the key that unlocks the ancient allegories of the oriental books?

In other words, are you a true Initiate? and do you hail with enthusiasm and love the perpetuity of the HOLY Docmn~n~, and the universali - ty of the same initiation in all the Sanctuaries of the world. SANCTA S~~1cTIs! the Holy things ‘for the Holy, for the KADOsHIM! In the Tracing-Board or Camp of this degree, we offer you a symbol, which, combining the mysterious num - bers 1, 3, 5, ‘7 and 9, with the Cuoss, that key of the mysteries of India and Egypt, the central point of junction of the right angles of four infinite Triangles; also, with the white DOVE, the black RAVEN and the golden PH~Nix, displays the LION, the Ox or BuLL, the EAGU and the radiant heart of the MAN, of Masonic Symbolism, in conjunction with the Aux of the COVENANT, between the Mithriac palms and torches; and so brings us face to face with the splendid images of the Prophet Ezekiel, and the Apocalypse of Saint John. The new Temple of Ezekiel, with its Kabalistic measure - ments, is the type of the labors of the primitive Masonry. Saint John, in his Apocalypse, reproduces the same images and the same numbers, and ideally reconstructs the Edenic world in the new Jerusalem; but at the source of the four rivers, flowing to four cardinal points, and forming the Great Mystic Cross of our Tracing-Board, the Solar L.&i~a replaces the mysterious Tree. Initiation by toil and blood is accom - plished; and there is no longer any Temple, because the Light of Truth is universally diffused, and the Universe itself has become one Temple of Justice. In the four symbolic animals, the EAGu~, the MAN, the"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"20 TIIIRTY-SWOND DEGREE. Ox and the Lio&, Ezekiel typified the foui~ Male Am~sha - §‘p~ntas of Zarathustra, the Divine Wisdom, the Divine Word, or Wisdom uttering itself as the Human Intellect, the Divine Power, and the Divine Sovereignty. The RAVEN of JUSTICE, inflexible LAW of Demerit and Puii - ishment, and of NECESSITY; and the DovE of MERCY, BEinG - NITY or GRACE, and of LIBERTY, produce, in GOD and NATURE, the Lra~r, the IMMORTALITY and the victorious GLORY, of which the PH~~ is the symbol; and these three, like the three sides of the Triangle of our Camp, are UNITY. To the LIoN, the EAGLE, the MAN and the Brxu.~, correspond, respectively, the four elements of the ancients and the al - chemists, FIRE, Am, WATER and EARTH. Man becomes king of the animals only by subduing them, or by appropriating them. Otherwise hewoiild be their victim or slave. And the animals figure our passions, or the instinctive forces of nature. The world is a field of battle, which Liberty disputes with the Force of Inertia, by opposing to it A ctive Force. The physical laws are the mill-stones, of which he who is not the miller will be the grain. Man is called to be king of the Air, the Water, the Earth and the Fire; but to reign over these four animals of sym - bolism, he must conquer and enchain them. He who aspires to be a Sage, to know the great enigma and royal secret of nature, must be the heir and despoiler of the Sphynx. He must have its human head, in order to possess the faculty of speech; the wings of the Eagle, to conquer the heights; the flanks of the Bull, to traverse the depths; and the claws of the Lion, to make way for himself, right and left, before and behind. The Oracles have always uttered enigmas, fatal to those who misunderstood them. Nature teaches by symbols, and not by explanations. If the symbols of Masonry have been misinterpreted, the same has happened to those of nature. The Sage invents or adopts the symbol, and ignorance, conceit and malice interpret it, each after his own manner, until the Truth becomes Folly, and the sublime degenerates into com - mon-place."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 21 Symbols are the language of Masonry, as they are the language of God and nature. There is no word, or sign, or thing, in Masonry, however triviul it may seem, that does not have a meaning for the true Initiate. The Altar and the Throne! symbols originally .of the instruction of the Sage and the paternal government of the ablest and the bravest; but now the representative signs of intolerance and spiritual bondage, and of despotism unre - strained by constitutional guarantees. But here the ancient symbolism is preserved, and you sit between Instruction and Protection, facing the source of Light. When the Knights of the Order of the Temple were mul - tiplied until they became armies, that happened which at length comes to pass in all Mysteries, Orders and Rites what - ever. The large mass of the Knights, mere soldiers and unlettered men, were unfit to be entrusted with the chief secrets of the Order, and these were confined to only a select few, forming an inner circle in the Order; and pains were taken, while sceminLi to make all known to all, to cou~eal them by symbols, by enigmatical expressions, by trivial ex - planations, which led away from the Truth, instead of to - ~vard it. The same thing has occurred in Masonry: not only in that of the Blue degrees, where no symbol receives its true explanation, the formulas have been reduced to the merest forms of ~vords, and the most essential portion of the third degree has been ~vholly cut away; but also in the higher degrees, ~vhere each, intended to be exclusive, has multiplied its memb~rs, until a ne~v degree and then again a new one have become necessary, in turn to become ~vorthless and be abandoned to the multitude that soon gained admission. After a portion of the Templars assumed the title and es - tablished the Order of Knights Kaclosh, the same evil was not slow to manifest itself, and to compel the creation of a still higher degree, a circle within the circle, to whose mem - bers alone the higher secrets were entrusted. Into that• degree you no~v seek to be admitted. In addition to the necessity for concealing The ~ that the Kadosh were really"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"22 TH~tY-~SLI~6ND DEGREE. but the Knights of the Temple of Solomon under another name, for fear of suppression and persecution, the Secret or Holy Doctrine, which had never been entrusted to any save a select few among the Knights of the Temple, was not of a nature to be appreciated or understood by the vast majority of the Brethren. The same anti-papal spirit, growing out of the natural repugnance of men of intellect to the yoke of a spiritual despotism, that made Reason and Free Thought crimes, and which was hidden under the grotesque mask of Rabelais, behind the jargon of Alchemy and the Hermetic philoso - phy, in the Roman de la Rose, and in the splendid verse of Dante, ruled in the inner circle of the Order of the Tem - ple, and was carefully concealed in the symbols of the new Orders, which even adopted titles so lofty and high-sound - ing as to be absurd, for the purpose, by exciting ridicule, of turning aside suspicion. Born in Palestine, and defending the Cross for two centu - ries in Syria, the Order of the Temple was reared, as it were, and grew to manhood, in the cradle, not only of the ancient oriental faiths, but of Christianity itself. Around it breathed the influences of the Hindu and Egyptian philosophy, natu - ralized in Asia Minor by Pythagoras; of the Persian creed, studied by the Hebrews while captives, and intermingled with the mystical enigmas of the Kabalah; of the Grecian and Alexandrian Platonism; of Gnosticism and the doctrines of Manes; and above all, of the teachings of Saint John, whose followers never admitted the spiritual supremacy of Rome, and dissented from many of her doctrines. Even when the thirty-second degree was created, in order that the profounder doctrine might be confined to a select few, it was deemed necessary to teach it only orally, and to conceal its mysteries by the great symbol of the military Camp, said to be the invention of Frederic the Great, and to give no key to its meaning except by a word or two, intended to appear to be taken at random and without particular mo - tive or object. In the meantime, the practical purposes of the Order re -"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"LEGENDA. 23 mained the same, and were pursued with untiing assi - duity. ‘While by their philosophical tenets they asserted their independence in matters of faith and creed, and denied the infallibility and the right of dictation of any Church, the Knights are believed to have adopted the forms of Masonry, and become the Kadosh, ~vith the in - tent, by accepting KhirQm as their Hero, to teach the doc - trines of Equality and Fraternity. The Brotherhood of the human race ~vas taught by Christianity; but it was left to Masonry to preach the doctrine of political Equality. Clement V., and Philip the Fair, who had murdered De Molai and suppressed and plundered the Great Order, had long since become mere names in history; but the mitre of the one and the crown of the other were the symbols, and remain the symbols of the enemies ~vhom it is the purpose of the Order of the Temple of Solomon, of the Holy House, or Hierodom, of Jerusalem, to war against without remission or relaxation. Daily the Pope must submit to see his influ - ence and prerogative narrowed and circumscribed, his tempo - ral power by degrees annulled, and his spiritual supremacy acknowledged only by those countries in Europe whose peo - ple are deepest sunken in ignorance and superstition. Daily the Kings must yield to the just demands of their subjects, recognize the people as the only true source of power, and submit to see their prerogatives lessened and their powers restrained by constitutional guarantees of individual free - dom. Such is the decree of destiny. If the people are content with freedom of conscience and constitutional liberty, it will be ~vell. If, going to the other extreme, they plunge into universal doubt and anarchy, let us hope that this may be but a step in the process of spiritual and political regenera - tion. For us, the only law is, to fulfil our duty. Blue Masonry neither remembers its duty, nor knows• its powers. It can neither prevent political convulsions, nor avert the horrors of civil war. When these rage, its voice is not uplifted to still the storm; but it withdraws into its cells and asyla, hoping to emerge again when the skies are"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"TIHRTY-SECONIJ DEGREE. clear once more, to renew its self-glorification, and weary men with its idle vanities. If you still desire to be received in this degree, you desire to be numbered among the apostles of Human Liberty. You seek neither an easy, nor a safe, nor a profitable task. The crucifixion of Christ ~vas clamorously demanded by the very peol)le ~vhom he sought to serve; and it is the malefactor whose release is most conunonly demanded by the multitude. If the history of Christ were not true, it would be none the less instructive as a lesson in human nature. It is chiefly the Ignorance of the masses, that fits them to be the ready slaves of despotism, and the prey and instru - ments of the Demagogue. It has, in whole countries, de - graded the populace to a level with the beasts of burden, causing them to bow their necks eagerly to the yoke of the King and Priest, and hug the chains that gall their limbs. It is the potent auxiliary of Tyranny and Hypocrisy, by which the souls and bodies of the multitude are kept in bondage, till they regard themselves as an inferior race, born to toil, that Power and Craft may live in luxury, and Rank and Privilege be pensioned by the Public. It fitted the populace of Rome to be slaves to the Cinsars, and howl for bread and the games of the Circus; made the peasantry of France, up to the latter part of the eighteenth century, the peers only of their own oxen; continued serfdom and vas - salage for many centuries in England; and has upheld thrones and pontificates in all ages of the world. In free countries it is quite as dangerous; for it makes the masses the ready instruments of the Demagogue, gives in - fluence to the corrupt, and places in office the base and the unworthy, entrusting to the blind the care of the country’s destinies, because they possess the art of pandering to the passions of the populace, and flattering their vanity and prejudices; until the experiment of governing the country by the basest fails, and all rushes headlong into general ruin.

What the mass thus learns is hardly worthy to be termed knowlelye, unless accompanied with other in - struction. Cheap knowledge for the million, and lectures that give a smattering of information in science, physics and other branches of knowledge, go but a little way to fit a people to be free. The S~viss maintained their independence and their freedom for centuries, without popular education; and the philosophers of Athens were the true teachers to whom the Athenians owed their love for liberty. To educate the people truly, is to teach them their rights as men, and their duties as citizens. The pulpit would be the best teacher, if the priesthood ~vould be content with its old office of instructor, and would teach less error and more truth. To l)e able to read is but to possess the means of obtaining knowledge; and the kno~vledge the people need is not of chemistry or geology, astronomy or physics, but of their own nature and dignity in the scale of creation, of the characteristics of true and rational liberty, and of the means l)y which alone it can be ac(luired and maintained. To a l)eople already free, tIme knowledge that will enable them to ~letect the charlatan and impostor among those who seek their suifrages, and to discoyer the ~vise and able man among those ~vho do or do not seek them, is the most valu - able of all. To eradicate false ideas and gross errors in regard to religion and government, and replace them ~vith sound and true notions, is the education ~vhich the people need and Masonry ~vould fain give them. If this could be achieved, Despotism would be dethroned everpvhere, and no more republics suffer shipwreck; and tIme trade of the Tyrant, the Hypocrite and the Demagogue ceasing, every child of God ~vould possess that share in his inheritance to which his intellect, his virtues and his deeds should entitle him."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"26 THIRTY-3~ND DEGREE. Ignorance, indeed, is not only inconsistent witim learning, education, scholarship; but it is often found most dense, in association with them. For ignorance in the truest sense of time word, is the not-knowing the Truth and Right. Gross error is gross ignorance, and much learning is often the fosterer of error. The most ignorant of men, indeed, are those who have a little knowredge, the rudiments of knowledge, what is com - monly called ‘education,’ which is, for the most part, a smattering, a slight and superficial knowledge of a few things, a thorough and exhaustive knowledge of nothing. You cannot war against Ignorance with the sword; but the sword is the symbol of Truth; and wherever you can do so, it has become your duty to enlighten the people and in - struct them in their rights and duties. To do so, you must yourself be well informed. Acquire the knowledge of the highest things, scale the heights of philosophy, study the lofty teachings of Masonry, not to communicate its pro - foundest truths to the people, to ‘whom they would be foolish - ness; but that, your capacity and intellect enlarging, you may be the better able to teach them that which they are capable of receiving with profit. In this great work, every one, however limited his sphere, can do something, and it is something, indeed, to refrain from misleading the people, since in that work so many are successfully engaged. • The second formidable enemy against which Masonry has to contend, is SPIRITUAL TYRANNY. IGNORANCE makes it pos - sible at first, and SUPERSTITION is its principal supporter; but it is born either of AMI3ITION or of FANATICISM. Nothing so degrades and brutalizes man as Superstition. By it alone, nations once resplendent with civilization, and from which as centres, science and the arts, and all that enlightens and elevates man, flowed abroad into all the countries of the ‘world, are now sunken in stupid somnolence and asphyxia; and this fate has fallen upon them, because they surrendered their souls and consciences to the keeping of an ambitious priesthood, sought for the Truth in fables, and became idol - aters, worshiping their own unworthy and groveling concep -"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"LEG ENDA. 27 tions of the Deity as God, and making those conceptions the law of their conduct; instead of listening to the voice that speaks audibly in the soul of every man that lives, if he would but listen; instead of learning God’s nature and at - tributes and the Law of Love which He has enacted, from time pages of the Great Book of Nuture, His primitive Revela - tion; and from the teacimings of the Great Reformers, whom Kings and Priests have always combined to persecute and slay. It is true that in declaiming against Superstition, there is nothing original or novel, and that the occurrences of the latter part of the eighteenth century in France made it sus - picious. It is quite true that it is the common resort. of those who pride themselves on an ignorant infidelity, and who by Superstition mean all religion and all reverence for holy timings. It is true timat in France the outcry against Superstition led at last to national denial of a God, and to the installation of a Goddess of Reason; as the cry of “LmEwrv, EQUALITY and FRATERNITY!” led to the frightful excesses of time Revolution, its murders by the guillotine, its assassination of Imarmless and truly pious priests, its noyades at Lyon, and finally to a stern military despotism; and thus the world became weary of hearing either; and smiles in derision when the ~vords are uttered. There is a God; and because HE IS, He has made Religion and Worship a necessity for man. All men must of necessity adore either the True or the False God; either God, or an Idol of the hands or mind. Without a Supreme Intelligence to direct it, the Universe would but whirl and drift help - lessly through the immensities of space, if it were possible either that it is self-existent, that is, eternal and without beginning, or that at some remote period it sprang spon - taneously.into existence from nothing. No Atheist can be a Mason, nor should any irfeligious libertine be permitted to become one. Masonry is of no Church, but it respects all, so far and so long as they only• teach and persuade, and allow full freedom of thought and freedom of conscience, and the right of private judgment."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"28 TItr~ -~. ~..MJ DEGREE. Therefore the ScotiisL iF~ee-masommry owes it to itself to declare that it disowns anarchists in religion as it disowns aimarchists in politics. Not deciding upon or discussing the mimerits of rival anti contending creeds, God, Religion and Worship are not for it hateful or evei indifferent words; and those who deny all these and audaciously declare an Atheistic immdepemmdenc&of all religious faith, cannot be of its household. To i~ronounce that God is but a umetaphysical and useless hypothesis, and that religious ideas are fatal to the people amid contrary to time dignity of humanity, is to announce a creed as hideous as to exclude from the social question the ifitervention of all authority and government. To dispense with affirwamice of a belief in the being of a God ~~‘ho is a protecting Pro~’idemmce, a Supreme Intelligence, infinitely wise, just and beneficent; or to substitute for the name of God the l)lirase ‘ Uiw Force S prieure’ or ‘Principe— C,~akur,’ is to return to the Egyptian Paganism ; for the ‘Force’ and ‘Principle’ need not be deemed Spiritual or In - tellectual, but may be supposed, as they anciently were sup - posed, to be inherent iii Matter: and the Linga and Phallus are as apt symbols of the Creator-Principle, as they an - ciently were in India, Egypt, Greece and Rome. The Egyp - tian God PTHAH with phallus erect was the Prin~pe-Gr~ateur and styled the Artificer of the World. Not to Religion, but to Superstition and Spiritual Despot - isimi, Masonry is hostile.

Fanaticism erects its own cruel and remorseless nature into a vindictive and persecuting God. It is the active, and Superstition the passive phase of one and the same disease. So long as Superstition rules the masses, Fanaticism will be as savage and as brutal as ever. To make up its character, vanity, self-conceit, selfishness and lust of power are com - bined. It is the true serpent with many heads. To make proselytes and extirpate dissenters, it has slaughtered mil - lions of human beings and shed rivers of blood. Its spirit still lives, active and vigorous everywhere. It seems to be an essential element of human nature. Even in a Republic where Church and State are divorced, where the Temples are built, and teachers of religion maintained by voluntary contributions, Fanaticism walks boldly in daylight, not para - lytic, but stout and strong. Denied the rack, the gallows and the stake, it curses and excommunicates, and teaches those of one sect to hate those of another. It makes politi - cal questions out of social and religious ones, turns the pul - pit into a tribune, and preaches a new crusade against men of the same race and blood and part of the same People. It exists among all sects; for there is nothing which man is so reluctant to forgive as a religious opinion in rebellion against his own. To teach and persuade, to direct and guide, those who need instruction, guidance and direction, are the just prero - gative and glorious mission of the legitimate Pontiff and real Priest. The founder of the Christian faith, and his immedi - ate disciples claimed for themselves no higher power. These Bowers of the sacerdotal prerogative constitute the true Holy Empire.

Moses did not even teach the doctrine of the im - mortality of the Soul. The mass of the Hebrews would noL have understood it. The gospel of Love, preached centuries afterward in Jud~a and sealed with the sacrifice of blood, was to begin to bear fruit and be effectual, only after twenty centuries of persecution. ‘Rather Turk than Papist’ was the motto of Luther; and Protestantism ceased to be perse - cuted, only to become the Persecutor. It is remarkable that the three religions of civilization, the Hebrew, Christian and Moslem creeds, had their birth in the Orient, among the Abarim and Arabim, the Hebrew and Arabian branches of one race. Each was suited to the period and the people at and among which it initiated reform, and each was an ener - getic protest against idolatry, in the name of the one Infinite God. The revelation of Divine Truth, to nations and races, as well as to individuals, is in proportion to their enlighten - ment. It does not shine on all the earth at once or alike. Isis always wears her veil. The naked eye is only dazzled when it looks at the noon-day sun. All religions are, at their origin, more for the future than the present. As Masons we deny the right of any Church or Pontiff or Council to prescribe to men what they shall believe, on pain of persecution, and to make honest belief or disbelief a crime.

But the Faith that persecutes always prepares for itself calamities. The conquest of opinions by the sword, the axe and the stake is short-lived, and by them no Church has ever been perpetuated in its supremacy. Reason is always engaged in reversing the judgments of Force. Even the Om - nipotent Deity has not seen fit to compel all men or a single man to believe aright; and how dare man usurp a power which can of right belong to Infinite and Infallible Wisdom only? If Reason had not revolted against Tyranny over opinions and consciences, what would be, to-day, the intel - lecLual condition of the Christian world? Armed with the doctrines of Masonry, we war incessantly against these ancient enemies of the Trnth—against Spiritual Tyranny, Intolerance, Fanaticism and Superstition. To pos - sess the Truth ourselves, is not enough. We are to propa - gate it also, cost what trouble, and expose us to whatsoever persecution it may. Nor must we flatter ourselves that in this age of the world, and especially in this country, Super - stition is no longer an enemy to be dreaded. Men are as prone to it as ever; and it may be doubted whether much of that which the vulgar believe at the present day, is not as irrational as the Oriental paganism. The vagaries of igno - rance and cunning are readily accepted by abundant fol - lowers as inspiration; a new revelation, administered by impudent charlatanism, creates a new religion, founds a State and establishes polygamy; pretenders to supernatural gifts, listened t6 with awe and wonder, establish new creeds of morals and the schools of a new philosophy; and im - mense numbers of men, forming powerful sects, idolatrously worship grotesque and hideous images of God, not indeed carved into visible shape in wood and stone, or moulded in clay, or cast in brass and iron, but formed and shaped in their own minds, by aggregating, and adding the qualifica - tion of infinitude to, their own ‘veaknesses and worst pas - sioRs.

The Hierophants of Egypt, the Priesthood of India, China and Persia, were philosophers. The Priests of the He - brews retained among themselves the little knowledge of their barbarous nation. The Pontiffs of Rome had learning and intellect. The Cardinals, Monks and Friars preserved the treasures of knowledge and the scholastic philosophy through the thick darkness of the middle age: the Jesuits ‘were men of vast learning, acute reasoners, patient and in - defatigable teachers of the Christian world and among the Indian aborigines in the remote and unknown West; and the Churchmen of England, .Spain, Germany and Italy, have always been scholars and logicians. But now, to expound the great mysteries of God, Nature and Revelation, to im - mense numbers of men and women, ignorance profound as night, self-conceited and impudent, and proud of the depth of its want of knowledge and education, fills the pul - pits, and undertakes to interpret and mediate l)etween God and man. Superstition has not ceased to be formidable. It is in - eradicable. The wisest and greatest of men are not free from it, and among the masses it will ever remain a compo - nent part of Human Nature. To fear and revere the won - derful and unknown is as natural to man, as to seek always for some one to whom to entrust the power of governing him; and the utmost that can be done is to labor to extir - pate those worst Superstitions that degrade and debase our nature; that lead men to imitate the God they have fashioned for themselves, by persecuting their brothers; and that make them the ready slaves and instruments of a cunning, crafty and ambitious class, claiming to be the agents and commis - sioners of the Deity.

While DEsPo¶rIs~I, on its ancient Thrones, its title strong by prescription, and guarded by Ignorance, Superstition, Fanaticism, Privilege, Rank and Capital, and by its armies levied of the People itself whom it oppresses, is too formida - ble to be overthrown by arms, it is, at the same time, timid and cowardly, and therefore merciless and treacherous. For Fear is always cruel. Tyranny forgives no attempt against itself. Even to be near the Throne by blood-relationship, has often been regarded by despots as a crime. The influ - ences that will ultimately annihilate despotic Power among the intellectual nations, must gain strength and ground in secret, by toil and tears, by slow and imperceptible degrees. Everywhere the Tree of Liberty grows watered by the blood of Patriots. Alone, you can do little; nor is it now in the power of Masonry to inaugurate revolutions and by arms es - tablish free Institutions. Still, by means of the multitude of its Lodges, it can do much, as it laas done much in the Past. An immense Brotherhood, laboring silently and in secret to inform the people of their rights, and prepare them to overthrow the Thrones whose powers they cannot limit by constitutional guarantees, may wield a mighty power.

It is useless to clamor against IGNORANCE, SUPEESTITION, and TYRANNY, in our Lodges, and repeat the cry of “Lr~En’rY, EQUALITY and FRATERNITY!” and no more. To widen too much the circle of our exertions is to invite our Initiates to do nothing; because we urge them to what they feel to be impracticable. The object of Masonry is, on the contrary, to effect some practical good, within the limits of that circle, however uarrow, in which its influences may be felt. It neither conceals an assault upon religion under its enmity to Superstition, nor a hostility to order and good government under its opposition to Tyranny.

Their composers were the Bards, styled ]~Ushis, who chaunted them at the sacrifices to Agni and Thdra, Fire and Light, and their manifestations in the sky. Most of the Hymns were composed in the PajijAb, the Land of the Five Rivers, on the Upper Indus or Sindliu; and the very oldest perhaps before the Indo-kryans came into that from Kabul, after leaving the country north of the River Oxus. Even the later ones were probably composed four or five thousand years before Christ.

The two names mean ‘Living, being, existing;’ and ‘Bright,’ or ‘Splendour.’ The Irano - iryans, ancestors of the Medes and Persians, inhabited Bactria, the Land of the Seven Kareshvart~s, or divisions formed by rivers, and the faith was even then an old one, having been taught by the father of Yima, who is said to have led that people southward, from the high valleys in which are the sources of the River Oxus, into Bactria. Everywhere in our own Holy~Books we find perpetuated the old Light-religion. ‘God is Light; and in Him is no darkness at all.’ ‘In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men.’ Darkness is not the opposite, but the absence and nega - tion of Light. Ahura Mazda had no opponent. The notion that Ahriman is the antagonist of Ormuzd, of the Very God Himself, grew up in much later days. If nothing had ever been, neither God, Spirit, Light, nor Matter, there would have been Darkness without beginning, and Space and Time infinite. Darkness was not created by Ahura, nor, the old faith held, was Evil. It is simply the absence or negation of Good. The Earth has always car - ried with it round the Sun its cone of shadow. Take the Light away, and Darkness remains. Light, the Vedic Poets said, creates Reality, Actuality. It is Life. Darkness is Nought and Non-Existence. To both the Indo-iryan and Irano-kryan races, Light and Intellect were spoken of as one. Masonic Light is wisdom and knowledge. Ignorance is darkness.

By this knowledge men become wise; but a vast propor - tion of what is called knowledge makes men no wiser. One moral lesson put in practice, one philosophical truth learned and appreciated, adds more to a man’s true wisdom than half that the sciences have to teach him.

Despotism is the spontaneous growth of the Nation con - fiscated by the Despot, the Nation absorbed in the Despot, the immense Me of the Despot expanded from one end to the other of the realm, substituted for the Nation, acting, willing, decreeing for the Nation; it is, in a word, the reduc - tion of the life of all to the profit of one, and the invasion of one into the life of all. Life is a law of nature, and power necessarily, fatally, whether it wishes so or not, must, for its own defence, extinguish it, stifle it, compress it, corrupt it, idea by idea, atom by atom, until at last it has realized the fable of T~narus, and, monarch of death, it reigns over the shadow of humanity in a shadow of a realm. Free Speech must be proscribed. If every one could freely unburthen his conscience, there would be formed in the chimney-nook and on the marble table of the cafe a forum on a small scale, where intelligence could continually give lessons to ignorance. Words entrusted to the ear would go, would flit, from one to the other, would run, flow, glide, flash, through space and from neighbor to neighbor, would constitute the occult power, the tacit conspiracy of opinion. Under a Despotism there is no consideration. Considera - tion is the recompense of opinion. Opinion exists only in a. land of freedom. Here every one lives in broad daylight, under the publia gaze. What he does, what he says, all the world knows, all the world hears.

It reigns by terror, it puts the head of Medusa on its chest; but the terror which it creates around it strikes into its o~vu heart. It makes silence, and silence alarms it; it makes night, and sees everywhere a phantom. The limitless authority of the Despot isolates him from the rest of humanity. He may sometimes desire justice, but he has only the power of the will.

The Semitic races appeased and gratified their Gods with the sacrifice of life, not only that of animals, but of children, and with blood, the smell of which they supposed to be sweet in their nostrils. But the idea of so conciliating and appeasing the Deities they adored, never occurred to the ancient iryan intellects. The kryan Priests were the Bards: the other officiators, merely their assistants. Brahman, ‘prayer,’ included both the hymn and the sacrifice. They did not pretend to re - ceive communications from the Devas, to be their interpre - ters, or to act by their commission. They did not profess to foretell future events.

There is no real foundation, indeed, for the pretence that the Teruplars ever connected themselves with Freemasonry, which itseli bad no existence until, at the earliest, the latter part of the 17th century.

It is said that when ibe Order of the Temple disappeared as an organizati6n, the Knights in Scotland were received into the bosom of the Order of Saint Andrew of Scotland; and that the Rite in Freemasonry of which the Knighthood of the Temple afterward became a Degree, added the word “Scottish” to its designation, to indicate that the Order of the Temple was thus perpetuated by its union with Ma - sonry and the Scottish Order of Knighthood; and for the same reason Saint John of Scotland was adopted as the Pa - tron Saint of the Bite. In the Grand Constitutions of 1786, the 29th Degree is called “Sovereign Ecossais of Saint Andrew.” There is no doubt, notwithstanding the account given of the ‘revival’ of Freemasonry in England, that it had its origin in Scotland, some time earlier; and soon after it came to be in vogue in France. Degrees, which together were called Red Masoury, appeared there, some of which were called Ecossais. One of the oldest was the Maitre Ecossais, Scottish Master. This name Ecossais was given to the Degrees, because they were invented by Scottish refugees, partizans of the House of Stuart. The Rite of Perfection was also sometimes called the :Rite of Heredom, Herodom, or Heroden, said to be a mountain in Scotland. One form of the 18th Degree was entitled ‘Bose Croix de Heredom, Herodom, or Heroden.’ As every one knows, there is no such mountain in Scotland; and it is therefore evident that the word had some concealed meaning. Hierodom (elepo6op) from the Greek iep~;, holy, and 6c~uo;, house, has been substituted for it conjecturally, upon the theory that the Templars established the Degree of IRose Croix of Heredom, now a Degree of the Royal Order of Scotland, which Order is claimed to have been established by Robert Bruce, after the battle of Bannockburn; and that they used the word, slightly and purposely changed to Here - dom, Herodom, and Heroden, as meaning the Holy House of the Temple.

The Governments of all Catholic countries were warned of it; and. the Degree of Kadosh was proscribed, prohibited to be worked, recl.uced to the mere taking of an obligation between the hands of an of - ficer, and called the Knight of the Black and White Eagle. But what is meant by saying that Hered.om was a moun - tain? Is it, simply, that the Temple was built on the hill or Mount Moriah (~‘~‘~‘y~ ¶~, Hi?r A’ iiliiriah)? Or, as is often the case in Masonry, is the word a symbol that has more than one meaning? ~ or ‘~, hitr or h6r, is, in Hebrew, a Mountain.

If it should be considered that this is merely an accidental coin - cidence, as probably it is, it may at least serve to chasten the zeal of those who deduce the most fanciful and far - fetched conclusions from etymological resemblances, even when these are really only apparent. What we do not doubt is, that Heredom is called a Moun - tain, by way of an additional clue to the Secret intended to be concealed in the word; and to make it known to those entitled to know, that the Knights of the Rosy Cross of .Uierodom were also of the Holy House of the Temple a~"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"8 IT~PO2~D DEGREE. ~Iepovo’aA~p.

THE Ishmaelians, or the Society whose name was cor - rupted, in the Crusades, into ‘Assassins,’ were a Mohamme - dan Sect, a military and religious association, like the Tem - plars and Teutonic Knights, having its members scattered over different countries. It is supposed to have been founded about the year 1090, and continued for seven or eight gene - rations. The Chief was called “Sheikh al Jebal,” the Chief or Captain of the Mountain. The word Jebal is the He - brew ~ Gebal or Gab~il, the city of Gebalim, or Byblos. The word Assassins was perhaps a corruption of ~ Kasadim [~‘~V~ ~ Beth Kasadim, Isaiah xlvii. 1], the Chald~ans or inhabitants of Babylon; afterward meaning Astrologers, Magi. Among the Jews, in the time of the Mac - cabees, and probably from the time of Solomon, “the Kha - sideans,” as is said by a learned writer, “were a religious fraternity, or an Order of the Knights of the Temple of Je - rusalem, who bound themselves to adorn the porches of that structure, and to preserve it from injury and decay. It was composed of the greatest men of Israel, who were distin - guished by their charitable and peaceable dispositions, and their ardent zeal for the purity and preservation of the Temple.” In many striking particulars the Assassins and Templars so much resembled each other, that they might be mistaken for branches of the same Order.

T~zI- secret was probably the same in the two Societies. The Chief of the Association resided in the lofty and inac - cessible forests of Lebanon, where the descendants of his followers are now known by the name of Druses, who still retain the ancient learning, and practice the ancient cere - monies. It is a certain fact that the Templars at one time entered into an agreement with the Assassins or Ishmaelites, by which they were to exchange with them the city of Damas - cus for that of Tyre. The attempt failed; but it proved the points of identity between them. There is no doubt that there was something in common between these Mohammedan Sectarians and the Templars; and this must have been a Secret or Holy Doctrine— the same for which the Templars were persecuted and de - stroyed. The Templars adopted for their emblem or distinctive badge or symbol, a very peculiar cross, the same as that worn by the Manich~ans, and the emblem of the Indian Buddhists. It is red, mounted on a Calvary, and an em - blem of the Tree of Life. The eight-pointed red cross proves the Templars to have had something in common with the oriental philosophical Sects of Buddhists and Manich~ans. The latter had a book, called the Treasure, or the Book of Perfection. What is the “Royal Secret,” and why are the Princes of it “the faithful guardians of the Sacred Treasure”? Why, also, was the Beauseant half white and half black, unless it was a philosophical and religious symbol? We know that the disciples of Manes held the doctrine of the two Principles of good and evil, in this ±espect adopting the dogma of Za.. rathustra; while, at the same time, as we learn from Saint Augustine, who once belonged to the Sect, they were Trinb I~arians, believing in the Tri-une Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

The Templars in England formerly held tI~eir Chapters in the crypts of the Churches and Cathedrals, though the Gnostic emblems are not found in those Churches alone with which the Templars were connected. The Templar Churches were round like that of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, like the House of Solomon or Academy of Instruction built at Cairo about the end of the 11th century. There are now only four of these round Churches in England. Each was, no doubt, an emblem of the universe. Each Chapter con - sisted of twelve elect, perfect or initiated Past Masters, after the twelve signs, and of seventy-two Initiated, after the Dodecans, the symbols of the Universe. It will not be over - looked by the sages who think, that the Sem-ham-phorash contains seventy-two names of Deity, and that the Hebrew Sanhedrim consisted of seventy-two persons. “By Wisdom” [HAKEMAHI, it is said in the Proverbs [iii 193, “in’ has founded ~ yesod], the Earth; by Un - derstanding [~Jifl, TAHu1~.iH], He hath established kunan] the Heavens.” So it was Salomoh, the personifica - tion of Wisdom, who built the Temple, all the timbers and other materials being previously prepared, and no tool of metal being used in its erection. As Wisdom, revealed as the Logos, the Creative Word, was the Grand Architect of the Universe, Salomoh the Wise was the Grand Architect of the Microcosm of the Temple. In the Kabalah, the Divine Idea of the Universe assumes the human form. This is “the Word that was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” It is the Macroprosopos, the Adam Kadmon.

The female is not created for him out of nothing, but he himself divides and becomes male and female. But also he is made after the image of God, in this, that he, himself, of whom the body is but the envelope and instrument, is a spirit with the power of tldnking, and of manifesting himself in words and acts that are but the utterance of the Thought. We know God, only as we know ourselves and the very selves or souls of other men. In brief, the Kabalistic dogma taught, what it borrowed from the Magi, that man was, in his spiritual and intellec - tual part, divine. From God all souls emanate, and to Him all return. There is the great question that more than all others concerns humanity; and which enters into the con - sideration of all other questions, even into that of all social and political ones. If the idea that man is in part divine, be but a dream and illusion of inordinate human vanity, man is one of the animals, to be governed as an animal, led, managed, persuaded, compelled as an animal, by appeal to his animal and brutal or selfish instincts. He is wholly the beast of prey that war makes him, when an invader licenses his marauders and murderers to ravage a land in - habited by those of their own color, language, blood, and kin.

The contradictions in human nature are only explainable by the hypothesis of the continually alternating preponder - ance of the Divine and the human in man. If the Divine is not held to intermingle with the human, the instincts, self - interest, and the hard cold reason of mere intellect are properly all to which governments should appeal, and of which the statesman should seek to avail himself; religion, denaturalized, sinks into a lower atmosphere and gro’vels on"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLAR DOGMA. 15 the earth, and the chief encouragements and incentives to virtue, heroism, endurance, and the nobility of forgiveness disappear.

Born in Palestine, and defending the Cross for two cen - turies in Syria, the Order of the Temple was reared, as it were, and grew to manhood in the cradle, not only of the ancient oriental faiths, but of Christianity itself.

It is as though the wind lifted a corner of the impenetrable veil, at intervals, and only for a moment, with which the art and jealousy of the old Hierophants have carefully hidden from the eyes of all of us the esoteric mean - ing of the Words and Symbols of the Royal and Sacerdotal art. According to lamblichos, PYTHAGORAS declared that it was in the Mysteries of Orpheus, celebrated in Thrace, he had learned the unity of the First and Final Cause; or, to make use of his symbolic expressions, he had learned that “the Eternal Substance of Number was the Intelligent Principle of the Universe, of the Heavens, of the earth, and of mixed beings.”—Life of Pythagoras, sec. 146. The Mysteries were in fact not established to teach the unity of a God, and the doctrines of Creation, Providence, and a life to come; but to transmit those great truths, which had been recognized in all times, and had been uttered in the most ancient spoken words.—Court de Gebe1i~’i, iv. 317.

Of this initiation PLUTARCH enigmatically writes; and it will perhaps not be unprofitable to occupy a little while in endeavoring to extract the meaning of his mystic utterances. The Sphynx, silent and mysterious, was the apt symbol of the old Hierophant; and Plutarch was one of the Initiated. “To desire and covet after Truth, those Truths, more es - pecially, which respect the Divine Nature, is to aspire to be partakers of that Nature itself and to profess that all our studies and inquiries are devoted to the acquisition of holi - ness; an employment .surely more truly religious than any external purifications or mere service of the temple can be. . . .

The clothing of the images of the Gods, part black, and part white, symbolical of the Duality of the Divine Nature, is imitated in the clothing of the Kadosh, white bordered with black, and the hilt of his dagger, half ivory, half ebony. In this mystery of Good and Evil we find the Beneficent Mind or Divine Wisdom, and the Malign Mind, its opposite and antagonist, of the creed of Zarathustra; and the investi - ture of the Isiacs after their death in these two colors, is a symbol showing that this Loaos [Word or Doctrine], “still abides with them, and that it alone accompanies them in another life.” This “True and inefl’able Word” of the Per - fect Elu, the meaning of which is the Royal Secret, is that by means of which the Adepts were enabled to travel into far countries and there to receive the wages of a Master. And he alone is a Master Mason, or true Follower of Isis, “who searches into the hidden truths that lie concealed” under the common-place interpretations of the legend an4 symbols of the third degree, “and examines the whole by the dictates of Reason and Philosophy.” “Nor, indeed, ought such an examination to be looked upon as unnecessary, whilst so many persons are ignorant of the true reason even of the most ordinary rites observed by the Egyptian Priests. . . .

Q. “Where were you first prepared to be a Mason?

If the choice fell upon a Soldier, he was immediately initiated into the Order of Priests, and by them instructed in their abstruse and hidden philosophy—a philosophy for the most part enwrapped in myths and parables, and exhibiting only dark Aints and obscure resemblances of the Truth. And thus much even the Priests themselves hint to us in many instances, particularly in those Sphynxes which they seem designedly to have placed before their Temples, as types of the enigmatical nature of their Theology. To this purpose likewise is that inscrip - tion which they have engraved upon the base of the statue of Minerva [Ath~n~] (whom also they call Isis) at SaYs; ‘I am all that has become, that Is, and shall be; and ~no mortal has ever discovered what my veil conceals.’ In like manner the word Amoun [or, in Greek, A,nm~i], which is generally re - garded as the proper name of the Egyptian Jupiter 1 is inter-"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"THE DE ISmE ET OSIRIDE. 27 preted by Manetho the Sebennite, to signify the hidden, and concealment . . . their invoking Amonn is the same thing as calling on the Supreme Being, whom they suppose invisi - ble and concealed in the universal Nature, to appear and manifest Himself to them. So cautious and reserved was the Egyptian Wisdom in those things that appertain to re - ligion.”—Id., 9. It is or seems to be the general notion, that the symbols of Masonry are used and were appropriated or invented as explanations; as a sort of picture-writing, intended to render easy the acquisition of knowledge. Hence the absurd, super - ficial and common-place interpretations of them, that make one wonder why they should have been used to express such trite, tame and ordinary truths or lessons. But the real fact is, that they were used to conce.’d the truth; as a means, not of teaching it to, but of ivicling it from, the vulgar. It was never meant that they should be easily interpreted. Like the symbols of the Egyptian Hierophants, every one is a Sphynx (half buried in the sand, moreover,) that only an ilEdipus can interpret. The consequence is, that the ordinary interpretations of our symbols and ceremonies are simply absurd. “None of the Grecian Philosophers seem to hav3 paid a more especial regard to the method of philosophizing of the Priests, than Pythagoras, who has particularly imitated their mysterious and symbolical manner [5 6u,u/3oAz;v ;ca~ ~uvori~pzc*c5e~], in his own writings, and like them conveyed his doctrines to the world in enigmas. For many of the ,Pythagoric precepts corre nothing short of the hieroglyphi - cal representations themselves. . “It is my opinion, that when the Pythagoreans appropri ate the names of several of the gods to particular number~ as that of Apollo to the Unit, of Diana to the Dzead, of Mi-. nerva to Seven, and of Neptune to the first cube (8), in this they allude to something which the Founder of their Sect saw in the Egyptian Temples, to some ceremonies performed in them, or to some symbols there exhi4iled.”—fd., 10.

They learn, indeed, that these are associated with the Master of the Lodge, another of its Lights, and that the latter is one of the three because it is his business to dispense light there, as the Sun gives light by day and the Moon by night. The Sun has always been the Symbol of the Generative power. In the Khordah-Avesta, a work of a later age than that of Zarathustra, but much earlier than the Conquest of Babylonia by the Medes and Persians, M~AoNH, in modern Persian, Mm, the Moon, is female, and is praised in the MTh-Yasht as the producer of cattle, and of vegetation, as bringing greenness, fruits and health.

So if a Mason hears and entertains the myth (~ ~u~o;~ of the third degree, from those who know how to expound it in accordance with piety and philosophy; and if he at all times observes all the Holy Rites that are prescribed, and seeks, by forming true ideas of the Divine Nature, to find for himself “The True Word,” his progress in Masonry will indeed be an advance toward The Light. The blazing or flaming heart, in the emblazonry of the 32d degree, is an apt em - blem of incombustibility, and therefore of immortality. Isis, “after much pains and difficulty, by means of some dogs that conducted her to the place where it was,” found Anul~s, her sister’s child, and bred it up.

Thus, in particular, was the Soul of Isis translated into what the Greeks call the clog-star and the Egyptians, Sothis, Orus’s into Orion, and Typhon’s into the Bear.”—Id., 21. “Isis herself, some say, in memory of the great contests and difficulties which she had undergone, and of the wan - derings whereunto she had been exposed, unwilling likewise that so much courage and resolution as upon this occasion had been displayed, should be lost in perpetual silence, ap - pointed certain Rites and Mysteries, which were to be as im - ages, representations, or imitations rather of what was then done and suffered; with this further view likewise, that the commemoration of these events might serve as incitements to piety, and as a proper consolation to all those, whether"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"THE DE ISIDE ET OSIRLDE. 31 men or women, who might at any time after be in like cir - cumstances of distress.”—Id., 34. “So again, the histories upon which the most solemn feasts of Bacchus, the Titanict and Nuktelia are founded, do they not exactly correspond with what we are told of the cutting in pieces of Osiris, of his rising again, and of his new life? nor does what relates to his burial in any way contradict this notion.”—Icl., 35. “The word Amoun is interpreted by Manetho the Seben - nite to signify concealment, or something which is hidden. Hecat~eus of Abdera, indeed tells us, that the Egyptians make use of this term when they call out to one another; and if so, then their invoking Arnoun is the same thing as calling upon the Supreme Being (whom they s’zppose hidden and concealed in the Universal Nature) to appear and mani - fest itself to them.”—Id., 9. * * * * * * * “They further add that Isis and Osiris, having a mutual affection, enjoyed each other in their mother’s womb, before they were born, and that from this commerce sprang Aroue - ris, whom the Egyptians likewise call the elder Orus and the Greeks Apollo.”—Id., 12. “The Egyptians are wont to give Orus the name of Kai - mis, by which word they mean ‘Something which may be seen’; for this world is perceptible to the senses, and visi - ble.”—Id., 56. Plutarch was like a man walking in. the dark. The “Some - thing which may be seen” is that which is manifested or revealed, i. e., the Divine Wisdom, Isis, manifesting itself as the Divine Word or Utterance, in Humanity,—Yohuman6. Isis, he says, was also called Mum (mother), ATHYRI (that in which Osiris is); and METHUER, Plenitude and Excellence.—Id., 56.

That is, she is the Divine Wisdom, immanent in the Deity; the Deity in so far ~.s he is Wisdom.—Id., 53. The delineations, forms and Emanations (out-flowings, manifestations, revealings) of the Deity are diffused, he says, throughout the Heavenly bodies. All these, the Vedic Poets said, are the self-manifestations of Indra, the Light.—Id., 59. Plato asserts, he says, that the old name by which the Ancients expressed the essence of things, was derived from a word of the same import with this of IsIs: and then, to hide what he means, “that knowledge, wisdom, understand - ing, the chief-good, and even virtue itself had their names, in the Greek language, originally taken from this same, or a root of similar signification.”—Id., 60. “Osiris is supposed to be that common reason, which per - vades the superior and inferior regions of the universe,-.-— the universal reason, called by them Anubis, and sometimes likewise Blermanubis.”—Id., 61. “Isis is frequently called by them Athena, signifying in their language, ‘I proceeded from myself.’ “—Id., 62. The mind and reason of the Supreme God, which in its own nature is invisible to us, and dwelling in obscurity [hidden], by putting itself into motion proceeds to the pro - duction of other beings.”—Id., 62. “Whatever beings are endued with life, with the faculty of seeing, that have a principle of voluntary motion in them, and that are able to distinguish what belongs to, and is proper for them, and what not, all these are to be regarded as the effluxes, as it were, or as so many portions taken 6ff from that Supreme Providential Wisdom, that governs the universe.”—Id., 77. It is evident, from these extracts, that the principal pur - pose of the Mysteries was to teach the Initiates “the Se - cret or Holy Doctrine,” the Theology and Philosophy, which the Priests concealed from the vulgar, as beyond and above their comprehension.

As iu the long succession of generations words in the same language change, and one let ~er O.isplaces another, until words no longer appear the same; as inflections vary, and particles appear or vanish and are dis used, and yet the grammatical forms abundantly prove the identity of the ancient and mod - ern tongues, when in the mere words one seems an alien to the other; so in Masonry, when all the details of the cere - monial have been changed, and even the symbols are no longer in important respects the same, and their present interpretations were never even dreamed of by the ancient Sages, still its identity with the ancient Mysteries is amply proven by the most satisfactory of all evidence, identity of objects, identity of doctrine, and substantial identity of its Myth and that of the Egyptian, Ph~nician, Samothracian and Grecian Mysteries.

This was dramatically represented in the Mysteries; and in all of them the Candidlate was made to represent the murdered Hero, and so ‘vas symbolically born ayain.

As usual, the name of the Hero is used to conceal and hide from the vulgar, but reveal to the Initiate the meaning and doctrine of the initiation.

Besides the general identity of the legend, there are not wanting in Plutarch coincidences between the Ancient and the Modern Rituals, even in the details. “When the Egyptians sacrifice to the Sun, they strictly enjoin all those who approach to worship the God, neither to wear any gold about them, nor, etc.”—De Is. et Os., § 30. “The seal of the Sphragist~, an order of Priests pecu - liarly set apart. . . .

When the ark or chest containing the body of Osiris had been carried by the waves of the sea to the coast of Byblos, [a city of the Phcenicians, between Tripoli and Berytus, not far from the sea, on a lofty site, called in Hebrew, ~ Gebal, the residence of our Giblernites, in. Greek Byblos or Biblos,] it there gently lodged in the branches of a bush of Tarnarisk [Erica], which in a short time had shot up into a large and beautiful tree, growing round the chest and enclosing it on every side. The King of Byblos, astonished at its un - usual size, had it cut down, and made that part of the trunk in which the chest was enclosed, a pillar to support the roof of his house—[De Is. et Os., § 15]. The real sepulchre of Osiris is also said to be in the little island which the Nile makes at Phihe, where his tomb “is overshadowed with the branches of a tarnarisk tree, whose bigness exceeds that of an olive.”—Id., § 21. In the sacred dirge or lamentation which the Priests made over Osiris, they “.be wailed him who was born on the right side of the world, and who perished on the left.” Perhaps the alternation of right and left in the first two degrees of Masonry, has a concealed allusion to this; and there is perhaps, in “the rough sands of the sea,” an allusion to the fact, that the Egyptian Priests “expressed an abhorrence, both toward the Sea, as well as Salt, calling this latter Typhon’s foam, and amongst their other prohibitions, forbid - ding it to be ever laid upon their tables.”—De Is. et Os., § 32.

We know its meaning now, but Plutarch did not, nor did lamblichus. It had been lost long before they lived. Pythagoras had too carefully concealed it; and these later writers looked in the wrong direction for it. Plu - tarch’s explanation, altogether wron’~, is as follows. “Now universal Nature, in its utmost and most perfect extent, may be considered as made up of these three things, of Intelligence, of Matter, and of that which is the result of both these, in the Greek language called Kosmos, a word which, equally signifies, either Bca~ty and Order, or the World itself. The first of these is the same with what Plato is wont to call the Idea, the Exernplar and the Father; to the second of them he has given the name of the Mother, the Nurse and the place and receptacle q/ generation; and to the latter of them that of the qflspring and the production.” “So again, with regard to the Egyptians, there is good reason to conclude, that they were wont to liken the Uni - versal Nature to what they called the most beautiful and perfect Triangle; the same as does Plato himself, in that nuptial diagram, as it is termed, which he has introduced into his Commonwealth. Now in this Triangle, which is rectangular, the perpendicular side is imagined equal to three, the base to four, and the hypothenuse which is equal [whose squarc is equal] to the [squares of the] other two containing sides, tofive. [3x3=9,4x4z 16,5x5 25, 9 + 16 = 25; ~vhich is the 47th Proposition of Euclid.] In this scheme, therefore, we must suppose, that the perpendicu - lar is designed by them to represent the masculine Nature, the lase the feminine, and that the hypothenuse is to be looked upon as the offspring of both; and accordingly the first of them will aptly enough represent O&iris or the Prime Cause; the second, Isis, or the receptive Power; the last Orus or the common effect of the other two.

Plutarch considers Isis to be “the feminine part of Na - ture, or that property of Nature which renders her a fit sub - ject for the production of all other beings; for which reason it is that Plato calls her the Nurse and All-Receiver, and that she is vulgarly termed Jlyrionymus, or the myriad- named Goddess; denoting hereby that capacity, with which she is endued, of receiving and being converted into all manner of forms and species, which it shall please the Su - preme Reason to impress upon her.”—De Is. et Os., ~ 53. The Temple of Solomon, like every Lodge, is a Symbol of Isis or Universal Nature; and the works of the Supreme Reason are symbolized by the labors of Khirj~m upon the Temple, and the columns, vessels and fabrics that he pro - duced. “The Soul of Osiris,” we are told, “is eternal and incor - ruptible, though his body is often torn to pieces and hidden by Typhon, and as often searched after, found again, and joined together by the wandering Isis.

Plutarch, supposing that Pythagoras brought his doctrine and its symbols from Egypt, wrote the whole treatise Pen Isidos kai Osiridos on that theory.

He did not mean that the Deity created by the instrumentality of abstract numbers. But this figure was connected with his theories as to num - bers, and in fact, its whole meaning consists in the numbers 3, 4 and 5, which the sides of the triangle represent and measure. The Masters~of the Royal Secret know what the symbol and its numbers did mean, to Pythagoras, and do not won - der that he was overjoyed to add it to the existing symbols, which, to those whom he taught to read them, expressed the holy Doctrine. SAYCTA S~cTIs. No doubt the doctrine taught in the Mysteries, was that of Pythagoras, and that of which the legends of Osiris and Isis, Adonis and the Boar, Khir~m and his assassins were the symbols. “It is impossible,” Plutarch thinks, “ that any one cause whatever, be it bad or even good (for God cannot be the author of any evil), should be the common Princi - ple of all things.” “For,” he says, “the harmony of the world, like that of a harp (to use the expression of Heraclitiis), is made up of discords, and consists in a mixture of good and evil; or, as Euripides has it, ‘Good and Evil cannot be separated from each other,’ though they are so tempered as that beauty and order are the result. From hence, therefore, arose that very ancient opinion which has been handed down from the Theologists and Legislators to the Poets and Philosophers; an opinion which, though its first author is unknown, has nevertheless gained so firm and established a credit every - where, as not only to be commonly talked of by both Greeks and Barbarians, but to be even taught by thern in their mysterie8 and in their sacrifices: namely, that the world is neither wholly left to its own motions, without some Mind, some Superior Reason to guide and govern it; nor that it is one such Mind only or Reason, that, as it were with a helm or bridle, steers and directs the whole; but, as there are many things wherein the Good and Evil are equally blended to - gether, or, rather, indeed, as nature produces nothing here below without such mixture, and as it cannot be supposed"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"THE DE IS~DE ET OSIRIDE. 43 that one and the same Being is the dispenser of these con - trarieties, distributing, as it were from two different vessels, the several distinct portions of Goodi audi Evil—for this reason, I say, was first introduced the opinion, that this mixture which is observed in human life, this inequality and variety ~vhich are discerned in the universe, andi all those changes which we see in it, at least in these sublunary regions, are owing to t~vo contrary Principles, to two quite different and distinct Powers. . . . For, if nothing can come into being without cause, andi if that which is perfectly Good cannot be the cause of Evil, then must there needs be a distinct Principle in Nature, as well for the production of Evil as of that ~vhich is Good.”—De Is. et Os., § 45. Plutarch proceeds to say that some philosophers term these two Principles two Gods; while others call the Good one, only, Gon, and the evil one Demon; like Zc~p6aorpz~ 6 Mayo;, the Magos Zoroastris, “who is reported to have lived five thousand years before the Trojan War.” “He called the Goodi Principle ~Opoga~;, (H6r~maz~), and the Evil One ‘Ap~tp~I’Lo; (Areimanios), adding, moreover, that as of all sensible Beings, the former bore the greatest resemblance to .Liglit, so the latter was most like darkness.”—De Is. et Os., § 46. The Magian Philosophers, he says, tell us, “that ORlwuzn sprang originally from the purest Light, and AHRIMAN from the most profound darkness. The former created six Gods, and the latter created six, of different natures and opera - tions, to oppose them. Then the former adorned the Heaven with Stars, placing the Sun in front of all the rest; andi then each created twenty-four other Gods, which intermingling, Evil and Good became blended. For four terms of 3,000 years each, th~se Gods are to contend with varied success, each alternately victorious and depressed; at the end of which time Ahriman is to be destroyed, and mankind for the future to live in perfect happiness.”—De Is. et Os., § 47.

This Evil Mind was the negative, and so the opponent, not of the Supreme Deity Himself, the Divine Light and Splendor, but of the Divine Wisdom immanent in him, ~;p~nta-Mainyu, the Beneficent Mind or Intellect. Ahura-Mazda was not the offspring of Z~RYANA AKARANA, the Infinite Time, but was said to have created in the Infinite Time the words spoken by him. The Chald~eans also had beneficent and evil Planetary Gods; the Greeks had two Jupiters, the Olympian and Pluto, and made Ilarmonia to be the offspring of Mars and Venus. Heraclitus said that Discord would never exceed the propor bounds allotted to it; for should this ever hap - pen to be the case, the Fates, avengers of what is rig/it, would find it out.” The Pythagoreans had a great number of terms, which they made use of to express the contrary natures of these two Principles; calling the GoodOne, “The Unit, the Definite, the Fixed, the Straight, the Odd, the Square, the Equal, the Right, and the Light or Lucid;” and the Evil One, “the Duaci, the Indefinite, the Mobile, the Crooked, the Even, the Oblong, the Unequal, the Left [Sinister], and the Dark.” Anaxagoras calls the one Intelligence, an& the other I~finity.—De Is. et Os., § 48. “By Osnus we are to understand those faculties of the Universal Soul, such as Intelligence and Reason, which are, as it were, the Supreme Lords and Directors of all that is Good. . . . On the contrary, those Powers of the Universal Soul, which are subject to the influence of passions, the boisterous, the irrational and the unruly part of it, may be called TX’rHoN.”—Icl., § 49. “When the Supreme Reason composed this Universe, He made one harmonious system, even out of . the most dis - cordaiit principles, and did not utterly destroy, though He greatly maimed the Power of the Evil Being. “—Id., § 55.

What mo c inconsistent, to our minds, than infinite jQstice and b~/ini1e mercy? They seem t~vo parallel lines, that will never even approach each other; if not t~vo, infi - nitely diverging. But Geburah and Geclulali meet in The Infinite, and harmonize, and are essentially one; and from them flow forth Perfect Harmony in all the Universe, the Success and Glory of God, the Stability of His plans, and the absolute undivided Empire which Evil does not share with Him, over the Universe. “Upon the whole, however, Osiris, or the Good Pi4nciple, has the superiority.”—De Is. et Os., § 59. “Osiris likewise is a compounded name, being derived from Osion and Ilieron; for, as lie is supposed to be that common REASON which pervades both the Superior and Infe - rior regions of the Universe ; by the latter of these terms the ancients would denote him in his celestial capacity, as by the former of them they would express his terrestrial and infernal infiuence.”—Id., § 61. He significantly tells us that “those who have not learned to make use of words in their true sense, will be apt to mis - take, likewise, in things themselves.”—Id., § 71. “The Divine Reason,” he tells us, “stands not in speech; but Marching through still and silent paths Administers the world with Justice.” “The Mind and Reason of the Supreme God, which in its own nature is invisible to us~ and dwelling in obscurity, by putting itself in motion proceeds to the production of other"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"46 ThI~r~T-sEcoi~D DEGREE. beings. . . .

And Plutarch thus hints at the Work of the Initiates, and at the results and benefits of the palm genesis, the being born again, of initiation: “The souls and minds of men are looked upon as the matter” [the Materia, the rough Ashlar or marble in the quarry or block], “of Knowledge and Virtue; and as such are delivered up to Reason to be polished and modeled by it into their due form and shape; thus some philosophers have even called the Mind the place of our ideas, and the workshop” [the usual and favorite name, atelier, of our French Brethren, for their Lodges], “as it were, wherein all our no - tions are engraved [or impressed], and formed.”—De Is. et Os., § 58. “There is nothing by which a man approaches nearer the Divinity than by right Reason, especially when it is employed in religious matters; nor anything which is of greater mo - ment to his happiness; wherefore it is, that every one who intends to consult the oracle, is strictly charged upon the spot, that he take care ‘to have pious thoughts in his heart, and seemly and decent words in his mouth.’ “—ici., § 68. “As, therefore, the souls of men are not able to partici - I"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"THE DE ISIDE ET OSIRIDE. 47 p5te of that Divine Nature, whilst they are thus encom - passed aboQt with bodies and passions, any further than by those obscure glimmerings, which they may be able to attain unto, as it were in a confused dream, through means of phi - losophy—so, when they are freed from these impediments, and remove into those purer and unseen regions, ~vhich are neither discernible by our present senses nor liable to acci - dents of any kind, it is then that this God Osinis becomes their Leader and their King; upon him they wholly depend, still beholding without satiety, and still ardently longing after that Beauty, which it is not possible for man to express or conceive.”—kl., § 79. It is but a little while since the first attempt was made to discover the true meaning of the Ceremonies and Symbols of Blue Masonry. No one had, until then, looked in the right direction for these meanings. The Symbols were Sphynxes, whose real meaning no one knew. Perhaps we have not yet learned the meaning of all. The field of study is wide and large, and there are few to work in it. We know now the real meaning of the Compasses and Square upon the Altar: the two points under the Square at initiation, then one, then both, above it. We know the true meaning of the three grips, by the last of which the body was raised. We know the meaning of the three blows inflicted on KhQrcim, at the three gates, and of the implements used. We know the whole meaning of the Mystic Numbers, the Holy Doctrine, and the Royal Secret. We know the meaning of the Eagle, Intellect; of the Man, Thought; of thc Ox, Strength; of the Lion, Sove - reignty, on the Standards of the four principal tribes of Isra&l. But much remains to be discovered yet, and will in time become known. Take the two columns at the Porch of the Temple!

The two Principles of the Universal Equilibrium are not contrary to each other, though in apparent opposi - tion; FOB IT IS A SrNGLE WISDOM THAT OPPOSES THE ONE TO THE OTHER.” “The GOOD is on the right; the EviL on the left; but THE SUPREME GOOD is above both, and makes the Evil subserve the triumph of the Good, and the Good serve for the reparation of the Evil.” Surely the subject of Masonic Symbolism is not yet ex - hausted. God, Pythagoras said, is the living and absolute Truth clothed in Light: the Word is Number manifested by Form: God is the supreme Music, of which Nature is the Harmony. There is, he said, a triple Word, for the hierarchical order always manifests itself by three. There are the word sim - ple, the word hieroglyphical, and the word symbolic; in other terms, the word that expresses, the word that con - ceals, and the word that signifies: all hieratic intelligence is in the perfect knowledge of these three degrees.

IT long since became very evident to us that Masons were like the Arabs who buildi their huts in part with fragments of the walls of Niiuroud and the casings of the Pyramids; that the true secrets and Kabalistic meanings of Masonry are unknown to ik~e~/; having been concealed under so many veils as to have become in part undiscoverable; and that the ordinary explanations of its symbols have merely been adopted to mislead the multitude of the initiates, the knowl - edge of the esoteric meaning having been confined to a few,. who long since died, leaving no successors. There are perhaps few thinking Masons to whom it has not. seemed strange that the TRUE WORD, promised to every Master Mason, i~ not given to ev.ery one, but only a substi - tute, of no particular sanctity or significance ; not an ap - proximation to the lost Word, but a mere trivial ordinary Pass Word, not even alluding to the Deity. The WoRn is the Great Symbol of the true Masonry, as; the WORDS that have come down to us from the ancient, Aryans and Hebrews were their great religious symbols.. We know that one of these Words embodied a theosophic~ creed. We suspect that the other, also composed of initials. of words, in like manner embodied a creed; but no one has~ succeeded in discovering its real meaning. Before the Symbolic Masons lost the Word, it had for them no other significance than it had and has for those who daily repeat it in reading or hear it pronounced.

So it is that symbols which once had an intelligible lan - guage for the wise become idols; and Religion degenerates into Fetichism. The Royal Arch degree, as it exists in America, is no part of Ancient Masonry; nor was that degree ever, in its 51"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"52 I~r-sEcoND DEGREE. present shape, a part of the Master’s degree. It is impos - sible that anything that refers to the rebuilding of the Tem - ple could originally have belonged to a degree of which the Master KHIRUM is the Hero, and which is claimed to have been worked when the first Temple was being built. It is true, that what is generally understood to be the WORD of a Master Mason was at one time ~iven in the Master’s de - gree ; but not as found amid or under the ruins at the re - building of the Temple. Neither is it possible that one should not be struck with the fact that not even that which is generally accepted as the True Ineffable Word, is communicated in the Royal Arch degree. That ordinarily given is of continual recurrence in the Vulgate, and hourly pronounced without scruple by all Christians. That used instead of it in some jurisdictions is a Word of the Ancient and Accepted Scottisb Rite, with a final m changed into n, by some careless copyist; in which sliape~ being no word known to any language, it is ‘ex - plained’ as resolvable into three words, one Hebrew, a name of God, mispronounced; one, the name of an obscene Assy - nan and Phcenician Deity; and one the Hebrew name of detestation of an Egyptian City, which never was the name of the Deity in any tongue. With this the attempt to give the TRUE WORD ceases, ex - cept in the Ancient and Accepted Rite. But it is to be noted that, as a hint or clue to some bidden secret, the sub - stitute for the Master’s Word, and the Royal Arch Word of which we have spoken last, are each of three syllables. What is most worth knowing in Masonry is never very openly taught. The symbols are displayed, but they are mute. It is by hints only, and those the least noticeable and apparently insignificant, that the Initiate is put upon the track of the hidden secret.

Some remain, proofs of the great antiquity of Ma - sonry much more convincing than all the babble of those whose business is to Invent and pervert and not to discover. Masonry, tortured out of shape by these interpreters, no longer has a SECRET and HOLY Pcuini~r, is no longer the SANCTUM REGNUM or HOLY EMPIRE. It was never intended that the mass of Masons should know the meaning of the Blue degrees, and no pains were spared to conceal that meaning. The commentators pretend to do what they cannot do and have no riUld to do. They deceive and delude those who read their works; and their only excuse is that they are blind leaders of the blind. The most prominent circumstance noticeable in the Blue degrees is the continual recurrence of the number three. Masonry surrounds the Initiate, in these degrees, with her mysterious and multiplied Triads; and not content with silence as to their recondite meaning, permits the utterance of false interpretations, which serve the double purpose of misleading the ignorant, the idle and the indolent, whom it is desirable to lead astray, and of indirectly indicating to the wise and the studious the true way leading toward the Light. For always that which guides the ~vise misleads the foolish; to conceal the Truth from the latter is to cause them to mis - take Falsehood for it; but to hide it from the former is to spur and arouse them to greater exertion, until they track it to, and seize it in, its hiding-places. There are, among, other Triads, three raps, three circuits, three degrees, three greater and three lesser lights, thi~ee columns and three officers of the Lodge, three gates of the Temple, three jewels movable, and-three immovable, three assassins—everywhere the sacred number THREE. This, and FryE, SEVEN, as composed of FOUR and THREE, and THBfl~ times THREE, are the Sacred Numbers of Masonry, as they were of the Aryan Sacrifices and of Pythagoras. It is the TRIANGLE, the DELTA, with its three equal sides, that is the Masonic symbol, as it was the Indian symbol, of Deity, accepted as such in the ante-historic times, in the"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"64 ~~-~cOND DEGREE. cradle of the human race in Northern Asia, before any of the great currents of emigra~on to Northern Europe, Greece, Rome, India, or Media streamed ~orthi from that earliest home of the ruling race of mankind. The symbol of crea - tive unity, the letter YoD, corrupted into a G, hangs in the East. The Master’s Square is but two of the sides of a right- angled triangle, one arm of it measuring 3 and the othe.r4. The figure of the 47th problem of Euclid, a veritable Sphynx, occupies unexplained its place on the Mason’s Tracing- board. The Master works with the white chalk, the black charcoal, and the crucible of clay. The Sun, the Moon, and the Master of Light and Life, represented by the Triangle of light at the altar, are the great lights of the Lodge. The Triads of Masonry are identical in meaning with those of the Mysteries, of Hermeticism and of Alchemy, all of which are found in the Kabalah. The non-material part of man, according to the Kabalah, is three-fold, composed of Vital - ity or the Soul of Life, Spirit and Mind—Psyche, Spiritus and iJiens, or Nephesch, Ruach and Nesckamah. To the Her - metic Philosophers and the Alchemists, man was composed of Spirit, Soul and Body; as Deity to Orthodox Christians is the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; and to the Ka - balists the first three Sephiroth are Kether, Hakemah and Binah. PHILO, the learned and philosophic Alexandrian Jew, teaches the doctrine of the tri-une nature of the Deity, and at the same time says that it is a secret or mystery, not, in all its parts, to be revealed to the vulgar. To the Hindu Sages, also, the Deity was three in one: Brahma, Yishiiu and §‘iva, or the Creating, Preserving and Destroying Potencies. The Spirit, Soul and Body of man corresponded, for the Alchemists, to the three parts that compose the created ~tJniverse, the Spirit, the Plastic Medi - ator and Matter; and they represent each of these Triads by Sulphur, Mercury and Salt. Male, Female and Issue; or Father, Mother and Child—these compose a Divine Trinity, everywhere reproduced.

Osiris, Isis and Har-oeri were the Trinity of Egypt. Many ancient names of the Deity consisted of three letters, as IHu, Bxr~, Ai~r=~, ATM, TUM, YAV, MLK, SDI. In the Tetra - grammaton, one of the three is duplicated; and of these three, the Kabalah represents ~ as male and ~ as female. These three—first, the Father, Generator or Source; sec - ond, the Son, Logos or Word; and third, the Spirit of the World, were a Trinity of the Oriental philosophy, differing only in name from that of Plato and Philo. Not a single Triad only, nor the same Triad everywhere, was deemed to constitute the Deity. The Will, the Divine Wisdom, and the Utterance of the Divine Wisdom in Humanity, were the first Triad of the Kabalah. Next came the Divine Justice or Severity, and Mercy or Benignity, in equilibrium, and their result, Beauty or Harmony. The Kabalist, Rabbi Schimeon Ben Yochai, says, “Come and see the Mystery of the word ELOHIM! There are three degrees, and each degree distinct and separate, and by itself alone; and yet, notwith - standing, they are all One, and united together in unity, and not to be distinguished or severed from each other.” What the Irano-Aryan Trinity was, the Master of the Secret knows. The Indian Trinity is expressed by Krishi~a, seated on a lotus, and with three eyes, through each of which the Deity looks forth. Ahura Mazda, in the Bunde - hesch, says, “My Name is the Principle and the Centre of all"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"56 ~~-3~OND DEGREE. things. My name is ‘He who Is, who Is ALi~, and who pre - serves all.’ “ In E~-pi, besides the Trinity of Osiris, Isis and Har-oeri, the Father, Mother and Child, symbolized by 1,he Sun, Moon and Planet Mercury, there was another, like those of India and Persia, composed of Osiris, Typhon the Principle of Evil, and Horus; the latter, like the Sosiosch of the Persians, and Iswara, being the Mediator, Redeemer and Saviour. “The Paternal Monad,” the apocryphal Zara - thustra said, “amplifies itself, and generates a duality; the second mind, so generated, sits by the side of the Monad, and shining forth with intellectual beams, governs all things. Men commonly take it for the first. Next after these th& spirit abides, ensouling all things.” By the Ternary we ever return to Unity; and the Human is ever interlaced with the Divine; the Triangles of the vis - ible and invisible worlds are always interlaced. Of the three interlaced Triangles of the Highest Masonry, one Is white, one blue, and one red. Th~ same symbolism runs through all nature. The Light, the Rain or Mist, and the Rainbow; Heat, Water, and Va - por, or steam containing both, were familiar to the ancients. Modern Science has only made the analogies more striking. Oxygen, which sustains life, and Nitrogen, which destroys it, combine and form the atmosphere. Oxygen and Hydrogen, burned, produce water; Oxygen, and metals until lately un - known, combine to produce substances long supposed to be simple, as potash, soda, and alumina.

The Samaritan pronunciation of the Word by the modernSamaritans is Yehueh. Higgins says, in his .Ancwalyp~is, that the Tetragrammaton could not have been that Sacred Word, the real Sacred Word, which could not be spoken; and he thinks that it was repre - sented to be so, to the people at large, to mislead them, and evade their inquiries. We had long been perplexed in regard to this word of four letters, which does not seem to be pointed to by any of the symbols, all of which that have any reference at all, open or concealed, to The Incommuni - cable NAME, indicate that it is tn-literal, symbolic of the tri - unity of the Deity. Higgins says, “The Je~vs could not be taught the Deca - logue, nor could they read the Bible in the Synagogue, without violating the very law they were learning, or which Moses was repeating to them, if the Secret Word were ~ When Moses asks the Elohim of Israel by what name he shall describe Him to the Hebrews, he is told that he is to describe Him by this supposed forbidden Name.” How could Moses say to them, ~ hath sent me unto you,” without correctly pronouncing that name?

The ancient He - brew books nowhere prohibit the speaking or pronouncing of the true name, The commandment is only that it shall pot “be taken in vain;” “thou shalt not take the name of ~ thy Alohim in vain ~—z. e., speak it unnecessarily or frreverently. The Hebrews write the Word, placing under it the Masoretic paints belonging to ADO-NAI, and pronounce that word instead of it, wherever it occurs; so that, although the Deity directs that He shall be calledi ~ the very peo - ple who were orderedl so to call Him, designate Him by 1~he"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"58 i~3!3r~-sECOND DEGREE. name of a Phc~nidan God instead; and we call him JEHO - VAH, a word of thee syllables and seven letters, a name almost as different from the true one as ADONAI is. The Deity is representedi, in the English translation of the old Testament, as saying to Moses, in Exodus, that He was not known to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob by His name ~ ~‘, but only by His name AL SHADAI. But the text must be in some manner corrupted or mis-translated. For, when ~ appeared to Abraham, in Canaan, and promised to give the country to his descendants, lie built an altar to ~ between Bith-Al and Ai, and there “proclaimed the name of ~“ [Gen. xii. 8.]. “And Abraham planted a tamarisk grove in Bar-Saba, and there proclaimed the name of ~j9 Al Aolam.” And after he had sacrificed a ram instead of his son, a Malak of ~ called to him from Heaven, and said, “By myself have I sworn, saith ~ [Gen. xxi. 33, xxii. 16.] And the angels said to Lot, “the cry about them hath become so great before ~ that ~ hath sent us to destroy it.” And Lot said, “ m~’ will destroy this city.” [Gen. xix. 13, 14.] “So Abraham said to his servant, ~ Alohi h’Shemini spoke to me,” etc. [Gen. xxiv. 7;] and the servant prayed to ~ Alohi Adlonai Abraham,” [H. 12,] and said, “Blessed be ~ Alohi Adonai Abraham,” lid. 27;] and repeatedly used the name m~ afterward, [id. 35, 40, 42, 48, 56;] as Laban did [id. 31, 50, 51]. Abimelech said to Isaac, “~fl~fl was with thee: . . thou art now the blessed of fl’~,’” [xxvi. 28, 29].

It is evident, therefore, that the name was well known to the old patriarchs and in common use. Noah said, “Blessed be ~ the Alohi of Shem,” [ix. 26;] and it was in the time of Anos, or Ancish, son of Sat, we are told, that men began to call God ~ [iv. 26]. If it were true that there are no vowels in the Hebrew alphabet, as the common idle notion is, then the word ~1~i’ would consist of more than four letters, when spoken, the vowels being then necessarily supplied. But there are vowels in the Hebrew alphabet, and the Tetragrammaton is not properly represented in our lan - guage by more than four letters; and these, far from being consonants, are all vowels, I’EIJ’E, each E being aspirated. There are here only three letters; but there are two sylla - bles, Hua and Hia, or, by the usual elision of the final a, of each, Ru-Hi. This means He-She or llIale-Fernale, and does not represent the Very Deity, but the Deity manifested and acting as Generator and Producer; Osiris and Isis, the Sun and Moon. It is very certain that this meaning, if really such, as Lanzi thinks it, was a secret one; for no hint of it is given in any of the ancient Hebrew writings, except by the state - ment in Genesis that God created man male and female, after His own image. But the Kabalah continually repre - sents the manifested and creating Deity as bisexual, and ex - pressly says that ~i’iri’ is the name of the Deity as main - fested, oniy—of a single act of Divine Thought, as it were, one of an infinity of units; and that the V9ry Deity has izo name.

The original name was undoubtedly ~, IEU. We find this, as well as 9 by itself, and ~, I and IE, used to signify the Deity. Kircher says that the first three letters of the name were absolutely applied by the Jews to denote the three superior Sephiroth; and Buxtorf says that the Yod characterizes the Future, the first H~ the Prese~it, and the Vav the Pct.st. Thus the word, in its symbolic applications, is only tn-literaL Parkhurst says, that this Divine Name, “~flfl’, I’EU’E, was well known to the heathen there can be no doubt. Diodorus Siculus, lib. 1, speaking of those who attributed the framing of their laws to the Gods, says, Thxp~ r’3i~ “Iov6exu5i; Mc~,o~riv icYropoUcTL nov IA.(2 ~rucaA=upevov Oeoi’. ‘Among the Jews they report that Moses did this to the God called ho.’ Varro, cited by Saint Augustine, says, Deum Judeo:um esse Jovern, that Jove was the God of the Jews; and from ~fl’ the Etruscans seem plainly to have had their Yuve or Yove, and the Romans their Jovis and Jovis-Pater, that is, Father Jove, afterward corrupted into Jupiter.

Nor does it seem probable that any Hebrew word whose letters were commonly known and written, should not have had as certain and flied a pronun - ciation as any other word. How could the Word which God gave to Moses in the Burning Bush, a Name, too, by which He had been known to the Chald~an Abraham, a word used in the Decalogue, and which was so well known that the common people were forbidden to take it in vain, i. e., to use it idly and irreverently—a word constantly recurring in the Psalms written to be sung—how could this Wor& ~e lost, in the time of Solomon, the son of the writer of many of the Psalms?

Moreover, the tale that the word was only pronounced once a ye~.r, by the High-Priest in the Temple, while a noise of trumpets prevented the people outside from hearing what was whispered within, is evident]y absurd if taken literally, and therefore must be allegorical. It was the secret mean - ins, of the word, or the secret purpose of concealment for which it was used, that was then and so communicated. The priests well enough knew that the Very Deity did not talk to Moses with a human voice, or show Himself in human shape. I’EU’E was but the manifested Deity; and the Deity visible would be but a single ray of the Infinite Light. I do not find anything whatever in the first three degrees that gives any indication whatever that I’EU’E was the True Word of a Master Mason. It seems to me, on the contrary, that everything calls for a tn-literal name. The 47th prob - lem is sufficiently expressive as to this. In the Bhagavadgit~i, a Brahmanic work, the Deity, in the form of Krishna, says to Arjuna, “I am the Creator of all things, and all things proceed [flow forth] from me. “I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all things. I am time; I am all-embracing Death, and I ani the Re - surrection; I am the mystic figure OM; I am generation and dissolution.” Arjuna styles him “all in all, infinite in power and glory.” It was the custom of the Hebrews to describe I’E1IJ’E by three Yods and a cross, in a circle, thus ~ The three Yods were also disposed in the form of a T Crown, thus: ‘pg, to signify the same; thus symbol- i z i n g KETHER, (CORONA or the CRoWN), HAKEM~AH and Br&.~.x, the first three Emanations and Superior Triad of the Sephi - roth. “I am Alpha and Omega,” the Deity is made to say, in the Kabalistic Apocalypse, “the Beginning and the End - ing, saith the Lord, who Is and WAS and Wni BE, the Om - nipotent.” We habitually hear and read such sentences,"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"62 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. and they have as little meaning for us as the monotonous murmuring song of a sea-shell. “I am A and big 0,” [in the Greek, 0-mega means Big 0]; or, in the Hebrew, A and T; the first anti the last letters of the alphabet. “I am the Beoin ning and the Endin~T” What do these phrases mean? 0 In Alpha and Omega we find the mysterious tn-literal word. F L(2, in the Greek is the equivalent of ~ and AIJM; but A and N are not the first and last letters of the alphabet, nor are~ and ~ or ~. The declaration, “I am the Beginning and the Endin~-r” is equivalent to an annunciation of the ancient Indian and Kabalistic dogma, that God is the Source, from which flows or emanates all that becomes, and to which, in the end, all r~turns; and a clue to the meaning of the incommunicable Word may be found in the Kabalistic signification of ‘ as the male, or the Divine Creative or Generative Energy, and of ~ as .he female, or the Produc - tive Capacity. AUM or OM is emphatically called, by the Brahmans, the monosyllable. “I AM,” says K~sh~a, in the Bhaga - vadgita, “of things transient, the Beginning, the Middle, and the End; I AM the monosyllable among words:” The word AHIJ [AIJM or OM], says Weber, in his In - dian Studies, indicates both the World and its Creator, merely as Existence. “This word,” says the R~mdyar~a, “represents the Being of Beings, one Substance in three forms; without mode, without quality, without passion; Immense, Incompre~en - sible, Infinite, Indivisible, Immutable, Incorporeal, Irresis - tible.” That is, the Source from which all Existence ema - nates; the Absolute, of which nothing can be predicated, except that it IS; Unity developed in Trinity, and in nowise acted upon or affected by anything distinct from or out of itself. This Word was only permitted to be pronounced by the letters; for its pronunciation as one word was said to make earth tremble, and even the angels of Heaven to quake for fear.

Etymological resemblances between wordis are sure to mislead, if too much depended upon; and the Hindu Om - kara, or Sacred Monosyllable, has been found by Godfrey Higgins and others in a great many places, in the syllables orn and urn, where this certainly was not the word A-U-M. Before we discovered its origin and meaning, we collected a great number of words in which the syllable om is found. Where there can be no certainty of etymological identity, resemblances amount to nothing; and, moreover, the old works which treat of names of the Ancient Deities are full of errors. OM is termed by Dara Shekoh the Seal by which Secrets or Mysteries are revealed; and in the Oracles ascribed to Zarathustra is a passage which pronounces the Sacred Names used in the Mysteries to be Ineffable, and not to be changed, because revealed by God himself. The mystic syllable AUM, as the Bhuddist Triad, is thus interpreted: A, the Vija Mantra, the Seminal Hymn, of the male Buddha or Generative Power; U, the same of the female Dharma or Adhi-Prajih’~, the Supreme Intelligence, the type of produc - tive power; M, the same of Saiiga, the Union of the Es - sences of both. But all this is merely fanciful, and as worth - less as the common explanations of Masonic Symbols. None of the many volumes written upon the Sacred Mono - syllable by the Brahmans give any reliable account of the origin of the Word, or whence the letters composing it were derived. It was quite as much a mystery in the most ancient times of which we have any record as it is now,—to them. The Hebrew letter Y~d is ~‘; the Phcenician 7’~ and Cfl; the Samaritan ~j.

YYD, the Siphra de Zeniutha says, is the Fat her, and HETH the Mother, and VAv is the Idea of the Universe, invested with form or individuality, within the Divine Intellect. It is the formed Idea, the Unity to be afterward developed in manifoldness. Yfid, the Idra Sz*ta says, is the beginning and end of all things; all things are contained in it; and therefore it is styled “Generator of all things.” This Yad, which, transformed into the English letter G, hangs above the Master in the East of the Lodge, was termed the Wonn and the VOIcE, as well as the REASON and WIsDoM. The adjuration, ascribed by some to Orpheus and by others to Hermes, contained this sentence: “I adjure thee, the Voice of the Father, which He first spake, when He established the Universe by His Wisdom; the Voice of the Father, which He first uttered, His Only-begotten Word.” “Wisdom,” says the Book of Ecciesiastes, “was cre - ated before all things, and the Understanding of Prudence [Binah], from evermore.” Again it says, “The Word of the Most High God is the Soarce of Wisdom.” “By Wisdom,”"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"OF INEFFABLE WORDS. 66 says the Book of Genesis, as correctly rendered by the Jeru - salem Targuin, Maimonides and St. Augustine, “the Alohim formed the heavenly bodies and the earth.” This is often repeated in the Psalms and later writings. The coincidences of the Kabalistic, Alexandrian and In - dian and Persian philosophies will be evident from the following accurate and clear statement of the common tenets in which they agreed: “All things are derived by emanation” (raying or flowing forth), “from one Principle. This Principle is Deity. He can only be known by His manifestations, as only we know the human soul. But He is Infinite. This Universe is finite, one only of the utterances, actual or possible, of the Divine Thought. Therefore we can neither know nor conceive of Himself, but only of so much of His Power, Wisdom, and Beneficence as is manifested. Yet it is He who creates, and we know Him as Greator, by His creation and creatures. From Him a substantial Power Fin mediately proceeds, which is an image of Him, or rather Himself, manifested by lim - itation, as one Thought manifests a Soul. This ‘Second Mind’ is the Source of all Emanations. They are originally included in it. It not only includes them, but is them, the ONE, to become the manifold.~ By the Emanative Energy, this second Principle sends forth these other Natures. They are more or less perfect, according to their degrees of dis - tance, and the scale of Emanation, from the first Source of Existence, and they constitute different worlds or orders o~ being, all united to the Eternal Power from which they pro. ceed. The Emanations or Sephiroth are so many rivers, iii the sea that flows forth from the wholly unknown and hidden Infinite Source or Fountain. They are the Deity, so flowing forth. The ‘Worlds’ are four: of Emanation, in which the Universe, Spiritual and Material, IS, in the Second Mind, dr Creative Energy; of (‘reation, in which the Universe exists as a Thought yet formless, generated by the Logos; of Formation, in which, in the one thought, are pr~sented all individuality and succession, definite and distinct, yet the whole constituting but one Divine Idea; and of Farri~atiort,"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"66 TELRTY-SECONfl DEGR~fl. in which this Idea, embodied in form, is expressed in matter. “Matter is only the most remote manifestation of the emanative energy of the Deity. The material world re - ceives its form from the immediate agency of Powers far beneath the first Source of Being. Evil is the ne~’essar-y effect of the imperfection of the lower spirits and of matter. The shadow is as necessary as the Light. The Perfect is God alone. Human souls are distant Emanations from Deity, and after they are liberated from their material ve - hicles, will return through various stages of purification to their source. This is not the public Romish Orthodoxy, or perhaps any other orthodoxy; because certain persons two hundred years since, used the word ‘create,’ in mistranslating an Oriental book, as the equivalent of a Hebrew word that meant to form, fasidon or fabricate, and which was used, in the passage misrendered, in relation to a supposed chaos, already ex - isting. But it will certainly be difficult to ~ by any direct language of the Scriptures, that God created the Uni - verse, and all Souls of men as well as worlds of matter, out of nothing. On the contrary, the Emanation doctrine, that from Him all things proceed, and to Him all things return, is the dogma of the Holy writings. God is there declared to be ‘all in all.’ ‘He that dwelleth in love clwelleth in God, and God dwelleth in him.’ ‘In Him we live, move and have our being; as certain of your own poets have said, for we are his offspring.’ . . . ‘For of Him, and tkrougk Him, and to Him are all things.’ Paul, in his first letter to the Christians of Corinth, dis - tinctly declares the symbolic and mystical nature of his teachings. Christ, he declares, was the Power and the Wisdom of God [Asha Vahista and Vohuman’, of the Maz - daya~nian creed]. “I utter Wisdom ;“ he says “among the Perfect; not worldly wisdom, nor that of the Rulers of the World who come to nought; but the Divine Wisdom, mysteriously hidden, which God before the ages pre-ordained for our glory, and which none of the Chiefs of this world"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"OF INEFFABLE WORfl~. 67 have known... . God hath unveiled these t.hings through the Spirit; for the Spirit attains to the cognizance of all things, even of the nature of God. . . . We have received the Spirit that emanates from God, thereby to know what the Deity freely communicates to us.” We have already given two of the modes by which the Hebrews expressed the Divine TRINITY. and disclosed to the Initiates that the Ineffable Name, the Great Sacred Word of the Mysteries, was tn-literal. They adopted, also the letter Schin, ~‘, as the Chinese did the Y, and the Indo-Scythi - ans the trident, a mysterious emblem to make known the same. It is worthy of note that the Hebrew ~, YoU, or I, was, in the Sanscrit alphabet of the filth century before Christ, .~, in that of the third, ~ in that of the second century after Christ, j~, in that of the fifth, ~ , and in that of the ninth, o~ In the fifth centuiy before Christ, ~u~i was, in the Sanscrit, , and however the character for these letters afterward changed, the single dot accompanied every one. In Vhe Phcenician, the Yod always offer.ed the triple form, as for example, ~, .(t’~ 7~’; so also did the Mem, as, ‘~fr, ~‘ ; and what Oliver calls the Kametz, under the three Yods in a circle, is really the old Phcenician Schin, ‘r~, the Hebrew form of which, ~, like the Phcenician forms U), \\-, ‘~, was a symbol of the triune God and the tn-literal Name. The Equilateral Triangle, with a Y&d in the centre, was a still more ancient and emphatic symbol of the same; all point - ing to a word of three letters only, as the NAiWE Incommuni - cable except to the Initiates. This too, is part of the con - cealed meaning of the 47th Problem; and the three officers of the Lodge—its columnar supports as Wisdom, Power, and Harmony—expressly indicate, to him who knows how to read the symbols of the Sages, that the Deity is a Trin - ity, and His Name tn-literal. Of course, the Symbols of the Wise became everywhere the Idols of the Vulgus, the people.

The fourth letter, when added, expressed and symbolized the Thought, uttered as their Uni - verse. This was the second ~ of the Tetragrammaton; and the whole word of Four letters expressed God as Mani - fested Existence, all that Was, Is, or Will be, the Universe is God—i. e., His uttered Thought, which is, to us, the A.LL of God, because it is all of Him that is or can be known to us. Everywhere, also, the Son and the Father were the same. “The Father is in me, and I am in Him,” said the Saviour. Each Kabalistic Sepliirah included all that followed it, de - pended from it, or flowed from it. The Divine Wisdom and the Divine Will were the ~same. The Father and the Son are one, Source and Outfiowing. Eve was taken from the side of Adam, to produce the Trinity of Cain, Abel, and Seth, as Noah was father of the like Trinity of Schem, Ham, and Yapat. The Deity did not will to create, then form within Himself the idea of the. Universe infolding itself in time, and then create according to that pre-formed idea. To will, to plan, to create were one and the same thing. The Universe is the utterance of a single thought, among an infinite possible number. It is the whole human Soul, as it is the whole Divine Soul, that thinks a Thought; but this Thought is not the whole of that Soul, nor does it make that wholly known to us. We know the Soul only so far as it is manifested by the thought, and as Reason, and Analogy, using this thought as a means, make it further known to us. It is like a single ray of light from the Sun, which discloses to us much more than itself. Often there is more hidden in the ancient names of Deity than we imagine.

The Ineffable Name, the Kabalists said, is not the Name of the VERY Deity, MNsop~, the MosT HIDDEN; but only of Him INlanifesteci ahd Self-limited as Creator or Source of the Universe. Bi~x~ was the source of BrahmA, Vishnu, and Qiva. Above Osiris, Isis, and Har-oeri was A~. To the Chalcheans, as to all the rest, there was One Single Prin - ciple of all things; and He was wholly beneficent. “All things,” the Magian Oracles said, “are the offspring of One Fire ;“ and it was as a flame that God appeared to Moses in the Burning Bush. “God,” Pythagoras learned of the Magi, “in His body resembles Light; In His Spirit, Truth.” God, the Kabalists said, is that Substance or Essence, of which Light is the manifestation. It is quite evident that a Secret Doctrine was taught in the inner Sanctuary of the Hebrew Priesthood; since the sacred books do not declare the immortality of the Soul or the doctrine of a future life; nor were the people taught a true and philosophical mono - theism. They learned both at Babylon. Mesopotamia and Palestine, if Antiquity could tell it to us, bad a history during ages upon ages prior to what we call the historical period.

The Secret Doctrine was substantially the same everywhere; and the Secret Word was the Symbol of the Secret Doctrine; and if any such Word was known to the Sages of the different Nations, it could not have been a Hebrew word; for the Hebrews were, compared to the great Nations, only a Tribe of little importance. To this Sacred and Secret Doctrine there were constant allusions in the varied use of the peculiarly sacred number three. The Trinitarian philosophy of Philo was not hetero - doxy. The very mode in which the Tetragrammaton was mystically written, nfl> was meant unmistakably to indicate that the real word was tn-literal. It expressed. the mystical numbers 3, the square of 8 (9) ; the cube of 3 (27); andl 72, the mystical number of the “Word Expanded,” ~ ~ Sem Hampizoresh, con - taining seventy-two names of Deity, and which was engraved, the Talmudists say, in the Sanctuary of the Living God, on a cubical stone, guarded by two lions of God. Its holy let-. tens explain the potencies of the Incommunicable Name. The Sem Hamphoresh, or H’Mephoresh, or Great Name of God, is composed of seventy-two words, each of which is composed of three signs or letters. Thence, it is said, is derived the knowledge of seventy-two attributes of God, and of seventy-two angels who surround His throne.

This great or L4a~zded name is derived from the 19th, 20th, and 2 lst verses of the xivth Chapter of Exodus, each of which, in the Hebrew text,consists of seventy-two letters. These three verses are written separately, in three distinct lines ; then the 1st letter of the 19th verse, the last of the 20th, and the 1st of the 21st being taken, the three clesig - nate the attribute of God; and by continuing this process until all the letters are exhausted, seventy-two attributes are obtained, affixing to each of which one of the Divine names, fl~ or ~, seventy-two names of angels are obtained, each of three syllables, and each containing the name of God. Each of these verses is deemed to have a mystical mean - ing. The first and second speak of the Malak Alohim (Messenger of Alohim), the pillar of Fire, and the Malak Alohim, pillar of Cloud (or darkness), that guided the People of Israel. The third speaks of the strong East Wind that forced back the waters of the Red Sea; and thus the three verses represent God as using the three Elements, Fire, Water (as Cloud or Yapor), and Air, as His Malakhim or Messengers. The Book Raziel says, “The Great Name of God, in seventy-two names, is composed of the 19th, 20th, and 21st verses of the xivth Chaptef of Exodus, always in the sense in which are understood BEGINXING, MIDDLE and E~n—three letters to each name. These are the powers of the Supreme Attribute; and by means of them the Sages understand every mystery—that of the celestial and terrestrial world of the Camp of Israel and the Camp of Egypt, of~ Light and Darkness, Day and Night.” The Fire and the Cloud were afterward represented by the columns YAXmT and BA.z, that stood at the entrance into the Temple; one of which, some say, was black and the other white, but this, I think, is an assertion without any foundation. We need not look for the secret meanings of Masonry in direct statements of doctrine, nor in dissertations elabo - rately expounding the symbols. We shall find them in the ponetralia of the labyrinth, revealed to us only by hints, and"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"OF INEFFABLE WORDS. 73 these hints hidden under many veils. Often only a single hint is vouchsafed. If two or three indicia concur, the meaning is established beyond a peradventure. The whole is a writing by short-hand, a species of hieroglyphics where single characters represent things. We are continually led astray in looking to Egypt for ex - pl.anations of Hebrew and Masonic Words, Rites, and Sym - bols. We ought to look chiefly in another direction. There was little in common between the Egyptians and the He - brews. The Egyptians were as much aliens to the Aryan and Semitic races, as the Chinese. Nothing among the He - brews resembled the Egyptian hieroglyphics. Hardly half a dozen Egyptian words occur in the old Hebrew books, and the meaning of these is only guessed at. The Hebrew is really a dialect of the much more affluent Arabic. The Jews were long a pastoral and nomadic race, living in tents in their land of deserts, hills, and oases, where everything still re - mains unchanged. The Tabernacle was an Arab tent; and the prototypes of the Temple and the Kerobim are to be looked for in the Assyrian and Phcenician cities. It was even necessary to resort to Phcenicia for Architects, Ma - sons, and Artificers. The Hebrew retained the Chald~an and Phcenician and Arabian names of God, Al and Adon; but not the Egyptian AtQm or AmQn. It is quite certain that the oldlest Hebrew writings have meanings that are yet to be discovered. No Hebrew has known for three thousand years or more, what the Alohim were; nor why the word governs a verb in the singular. Yehuah is styled the Alohi of the people of Israel. He directed Moses (~V~ Masah) to call him Ahayah (~~) in speaking of him to Pharaoh, but to his own People fl~fl’; and for three thousand years no Hebrew has known what either word meant. The sexual character .ascribed to Yixd and He is a modern conceit; and the writer of the Letter to the Hebrew Christians has toldl us that even the history of Abraham, Hagar, and Yesmael is allegorical. The truth is that Masonry inherits nothing of its doctrine or symbolism from the Hebrews; for, although it is the"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"74 TE -SECOND DEGREE. fashion to talk about the Symbolism of the first and second Temples, there is really no symbolic meaning to either; and the multitude of triads in the Lodge, with the absence of the number 4, eicept as part of 7, shows that the Sacred Word, the Divine Name, was not ~ unle~~~, ~, ~ were the initials of words now unknown, that concealed a doctrine known only to the Priests. All the Kabalistic notions about these letters, are sheer nonsense; and what there is of sense and philosophy in the Kabalah was borrowed from the Magian creed during the Captivity at Babylon and after - ward. Until then, the doctrine of the immortality or future existence of the Soul was as uiterly unknown to them as it was to their kinsmen, often their masters, the Philistines; and therefore they could have had no secret doctrine, and consequently no symbol. We do not find in their earlier books even a trace of the great truth that there is in the human anything of the Divine. The Kabalah discloses nothing as to the ancient faith. The Sohar was certainly not written long before our era; probably long afterward; but it does shed light upon the general oriental doctrine. The MANAVA-DHA.R~tA-§XiSTRA, ‘the Book treating of Duty of Manu,’ commonly known as the Laws or Institutes of Mann, says (No. 5), “This was darkness, unperceivable, without any distinctive attribute; neither to be discovered by the reason nor to be revealed, it seemed to be completely asleep.” (No. 6.) “Then the great Power Self-existing, Himself beyond the reach of the external Senses, making perceivable this world, with the five elements and the other principles, resplendent with the purest light, appeared and dissipated the obscurity.” (No. 7.) “He whom the Intellect alone can perceive, Who eludes the organs of Sense, Who is without visible parts, eternal, the Soul of all beings, Whom no one can comprise, displayed His own splendor.” (No. 8.) “Having resolved, in His thought, to make emanate from His Substance the different creatures, He"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"OF D~EFFABLE WORDS. 75 produced at first the waters, in which He deposited a germ. The I~a Upanishad says: “Whatever exists of this great universe Is all to be regarded as enveloped By the great Lord, as if wrapped in a vesture. There is one only Being who exists Unmoved, yet moving. Whoever sees All living creatures as in Him, and Him, The Universal Spirit, as in all, Henceforth regards no creature .with contempt.” In the Bhagavad-Git3, Krish~a says, “All this universe has been created by me, embodied as the undeveloped Prin - ciple. Alt things exist in me, and in me dlO not yet exist. . I cause this entire system of existing things to emanate in succession, without any power of their own, by the power of the material Essence. . . . The Seven Maharshis, and the four Ancients, and the Manus, partaking of my being, were born by my mind, and from them these inhabitants of the world are sprung. And Arjuna says to him, “Thou art the Supreme Univer - sal Spirit, the Supreme dwelling:” i. ~ .,that in or within which all the universe exists. In other words, the Universe, afterward brought into being and made visible and active in space and time, had always previously existed, in developed and defined idea, in the Divine Mind. The Kabalistic theory is the same. This existence in the Divine Mind was real and actual, the very universe there then, which was afterward uttered as the material expression of the Divine Thought. So, to illustrate, the statue hid in the rudle block of marble existed in the mind of Phidlias, before his will, of which his hands were but the servants, made the idea manifest in form and matter; but the Divine Idea is the Universe, though as yet unmanifested,because the Deity does not embody it"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"76 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. in matter, but utters it materially by His mere will—His Thought, thus become a visible Word. This doctrine, of the Deity generating andi producing Thought within Himself, audi uttering that Thought as the Universe, by means of the Creative Word or Logos or Rea - son, containing in itself all Spirits and Worlds, was for a long time not committed to writing, but intrustedl to tradi - tion only. It was the antagonist or opposite of the doctrine that the Universe was made or created out of nothing, by the Divine Power, and so was foreign to and did not flow from the Deity; and still more to that Materialistic Creed which held that matter was also eternal, co-existent with God, the female or productive passivity; and that He only acted upon it and fashioned it into the Universe, or generated the Universe from it, as the Sun, in the spring, with his light and heat, impregnates the earth and causes it to pro - duce. The notion that the Universe was produced by divine generation is not found in the ancient Aryan compositions. In them the Divine Trinity is, The Yery Deity, the Divine Wisdom in Him, and its Utterance, Intellect in Humani - ty. It creates good Thoughts and good Words only. All the later notions about creation by generation, came from misunderstood texts and expressions of the Veda. The three female Emanations of the G~i.thas of Zarathustra were only so because they were Divine Potencies using Matter as their instrument, by and through which to work. No no - tion of their impregnation was entertained. The notion of impregnation of female by male in the Deity grew up at a much later day; and after it that of the Word impregnating matter, from its impregnation by Light and Heat. - The union of the symbols of the Male and Female Prin - ciples, signified the union of the Generative Energy and the Conceptive and Productive Capacity in the Deity Himself. Everywhere the sell-action of the Deity was compared to generation. But those who held that the Deity only acted upon co-existent and independently existent matter, made"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"OF IYEFFABL~ WORDS. 77 the Conceptive Capacity, the fruitfulness, to reside in the matter itself. The WORD, to them, was but the operative and fabricating or fashioning potency of the Deity. In matter inhered the sexual impulse, as it were, the inclination and desire to conceive, known as kpco;, andl symbolized by the Dove. The first Kabalistic Triad consists of KETHER or CATAR, lit - erally, ‘The Crown, Diadlem or Circle,’ ‘The Will of God, because it wills to be manifested and become known,’ which is masculine; H~KEMAH, ‘Y[isdom’ or ‘Intellect,’ which is also masculine; and BINAR, the Human Understanding, the Divine Wisdom manifesting andl uttering itself in Man and the Universe; which is feminine. The prodluct, D~1th, ‘Think - ing, is masculine. The spark which the flint strikes from the steel, is a particle of the •Universal Light, severed from it, is tbe Universal Light, manifesting itself in the Spark, andl, as a Spark, having for a brief instant a life and individuality. Even so, the Ancients thought, each human intellect is a ray or spark of the Divine Intellect, of ‘the Light that is the life of men.’ Thought is torn of, or flows or rays out from, the human mind; but when we reflect, it does not seem to spring up there spontaneously. A Something, a Force or Energy, seems, from without us, or within us, to act upon the mind and provoke it to produce the Thought; and this thought often seems to come into our mind from abroad. The ca- pacity to think, belonging to the organs, spiritual or mate - rial, whose province it is to produce Thought, may exist without being exercised. The Divine Will moves to action the intellectual Energy, is itself the intellectual Energy, which excites and arouses the capacity to think, or the organs that produce Thought. It is curious that, as Kether and Hakemah are male, and Binah female, so in the Aryan tongue, from man, ‘to think,’ came ,naruv~, neut., ‘Mind, Intellect;’ Manskd, ‘thinking’ or ‘thought,’ fem., and mali, i. e., man+ti, ‘thought, pro - duct of thought,’ also feminine. In the original Trinity, of"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"78 TBIRTY-S~COND DEGREE. three in one, Fire, Light and Heat, each personification is male; Agni, I ndra, Vishnu: but Ushas, the Dawn, is female; while Mitra, the Morning-Star, is male again. In the Zarathustrian Creed, the Divine Wisdom Unmani - fested, ~ 3 ’peuta-Mainyu, the white, pure, holy, beneficent Mind, ~vas male; and male also when uttered, manifested as the Human Intellect, Vohu-man~’. T¶~is Wisdom uttered became the LoGos, ‘Word’ or ‘Utter - ance’ of Plato an~l Philo, the Creative Agent, the First-born or First-begotten Son of the Father of all. Kether is the Image or Similitude of the Infinite God, of Ainsoph, the wholly Occuk, Unuamed, Unknown, manifested by and as His WILL to do a single act of Omnipotence, by creating the existingUniverse or kss thanUniversal system of Suns and Worlds and living beings. To create it was but to form or generate aud produce, within Himself, the idca of that Universe; all its manifoldness and successions, to the remot - est ages, being present there iu unity; what we term its ma - terial reality, to be, afterward, but the utterance and expres - sion outwardly, of that Idea, Thought, and unuttered Word. The Universe, according to these antique doctrines, is the utterance of a single Thought of the Supreme Deity, the 1Th’rip “Ayvo7ro;. the unknown Father, who has no Name, and is beyond the reach even of the Intellect. From Him all has emanated. From him all Soulsgo forth, and to Him, when purified, they return. With this doctrine agree the dark all usions and mystic expressions of Plato and Philo. We know Him by His Wbrks, as we know the Soul of another man by its Thoughts, which his words and acts reveal. “Whatso - ever can be known of God,” Paul said to the Roman Chris - tians, “is manifest in them; for God has revealed it to them. For since the creation of the Universe, the invisible things of God are clearly seen, even the Eternal Power and Divinity, being made known to men by what He has created.” It is quite true that,. before the Christian era, there were a Secret Science and Holy Doctrine among the He - brews, as there was a Secret Discipline among the early"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"OF INEFFABLE WORDS. 79 Christians, probably introduced by the more philosophic Essenes and disciples of Phulo who came from Alexandria, then the chief seat of Oriental learning and philosophy, and were Christians in doctrine, as we are expressly informed, without having heard of Christ, needing only the mere cere - mony of baptism and to acknowledge Christ to be, like Krishna, the Logos, to inkrest them with the character of Christians. They were like the “certain disciples” at Ephesus, who “had not so much as heard that there was any Holy Spirit,” and had been “baptized only unto John’s bap - tism.” These, Paul, with a single sentence of no particular cogency, made Christians, by the ceremony of washing them in the name ~m’ A up~ov iby~ot3, of Yesus Adona’. We know that this Secret Doctrine and Secret Discipline were carefully concealed from the Common People. But it is not so generally understood that they were also concealed even from the Initiates, except the few to whom, as the Elect, the profounder mysteries were intrusted. Conse - quently, even the Hebrew books, written only for the few who could read, and no more known to the people at large than they were to the Etruscans and Hindus, only hint, at rare intervals and obscurely, at the doctrine of the immor - tality of the soul; and do not utter a single word which any one but a Magus or an Elect could understand, as to the tri - une nature of the manifested Deity. Those who propagated Christianity in Asia Minor under - took to make the doctrine of the Trinity known to the Common People. These were, of course, unable to compre - hend it in its philosophical meaning, and the Father, Son and Holy Ghost at once became to them three personages and individuals, like Zeus, Apollo, and Artemis. To the vulgar, the three Persons of the Trinity must of necessity always be three ‘persons,’ as they understand the word, as distinct from each other as Adam, Eve, and Seth. It was equally unwise to endeavor to unfold to the vulgar, in the countries of the old world, the philosophic notion of Deity manifested as bi-sexual. This led, as of necessity, to the obscene worship of the Linga and the Phallus.

But always, at last, the doors of the Sanctuaries turn smoothly on their hinges, to admit all comers who can pay the stipulated fee, except the worthy whom the worthless exclude. Degrees higher and higher yet are invented, some - times that the Elect may endeavor to conceal within them their profound and mysterious secrets; but oftener for the benefit of charlatans and adventurers, who, conferring fifty or sixty degrees by a sentence and a proclamation, pick the pockets of their dupes. Even into the high Degrees that are not frauds upon the unwary, the Odiosum Vaig its penetrates at last, blind and blundering, the most ignorant often aspiring to be Hiero - phants. Then a Rite falls into venal and vulgar hands, is manipulated and worked for profit by sharpers and itinerant pedlars of degrees; or if not, is mismanaged by ignorance, while the old rituals, with their trivial commonplaces, con - ceal from all the vain wearers of sounding titles the truths which it was once not safe for Masonry to utter aloud, and which it never revealed except by hints and to the Sages. Each Initiate will attach to our speculations in respect to the Sacred Word, such importance as he may think they deserve. It is at least certain that the Tetragrammaton was neither Ineffable nor incommunicable. Everything in the Blue degrees of Masonry combines with other well-authen - ticated facts to show that the real Word was composed of but three letters; and to this, no doubt, the tradition has allusion, that the Kings of Israel and TsOr and the Master Khiram had agreed never to communicate the Name unless when all three of them were present. They are the symbols of Wisdom, Power, and Harmony, and these three constitute the Sacred Word. It is also clear that the Word AUM is the oldest Sacred and Ineffable Word, only to be lettered, of which we have any hint in history or etymology; that it belonjed to a langnage older than any now known to us by any monumen -"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"OF IXEFTABLE WORDS. 81 tal records, and of which the Sanskrit, Zend, Persian, Latin, Greek, Gerinaii, Norse, Sclavic, and Keltic tongues were dia - lects; that it was a Sacred Word before the Median and Indian branches of the race separated ; and that it was widely known over Asia, if not in Europe. The Hebrew Sacred books tell us that the first human being born upon our planet committed murder; and it is not strange that even in the earliest days of the race it be - came necessary to conceal the highest truths from all but a select few. “Cast not your pearls before swine,” the Master said, “lest they turn again and rend you.” If, finally, the Hindu Sacred Word was not the True Word of Ancient Freemasonry, the Sacred Word of the Master, Magus, Hierophant, and Sage, it is not easy to ex - plain how it comes to be intentionally, as it were, concealed in other words in our Freemasonry, in the very mode which the Adepts always adopted to hide their secrets from all save the Elect. The Word, if it was such, has been long lost, and is not yet found by the popular Freemasonry. If ever reinstated by it it will be without a meaning, there. What we do now certainly know is, that we are in possession of the an - cient Symbols of the creed of Zarathustra, the Magi, and Pythagoras; and that we know what these symbols meant to them.

Hence it is understood, he says, how Plutarch, or whoever was the author of the work De Plcwitis Plijiosophorurn, said, that Pythagoras and Plato therefore only believed the Soul immortal, because after man’s death, it was to be restored to the Soul of the World and the cognate parts. And so Laertius affirms that Pythagoras therefore believed the Soul to be immortal, because that also from which it was drawn is immortal. Pythagoras is said to have been born at Samos in the 49th Olympiad, i. e., about 580 B.C. But this assumption by Clemens Alexandrinus is not well warranted, and the whole chronology of Pythagoras and of the stories connected with him is very vague. iHis story, handed down and enlarged by tradition, became to a great eitent an historical romance. iHis biography, says Bitter, Hist. of Anc. Pliilo8ophy, 328, “is enshroucled with a thicker veil of mythical obscurity than that of any other of the earliest philosophers; and the fabulous legends of which he is the subject, are nearly as ancient as history itself.” What is recounted of him comes, with little exception, from the last days of antiquity. Porphyry wrote his life, as also Tamblichus did, and Diogenes Laertius; but these wrhers, hundreds of years after he lived, told for the most part only what they had received from unreliable tradition. That he lived, and was the founder of a sect, is certain. fle - rodotus speaks of him, and of a certain secret worship of his disciples, the Pythagorean orgies, and of a holy legend or formulary.of this worship. And. Bitter says, “We cannot well doubt that the central point of all the science and knowledge of the Pythagoreans, and of Pythagoras himself, is to be found in the secret worship which he instituted, and which his followers regarded as holier than the public ser - vice of the Gods as re~n~ated and established by the State2’"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"PYTHAGORAS: HIS LIFE AND DOCTRINE. 87 All the writers agree that Pythagoras claimed to have re - ceiveci his theosophic notions from the Egyptians. Plutarch sQpposed his chief symbol to relate to Osiris, Isis, and iHo - rus. I think that I have proven that the secret doctrine which he taught was that of Zarathustra, and that it was the theosophy of the Magi that he concealed under his sym - bols. As this annihilated all the Grecian Gods, he necessa - rily concealed it, even from all but a select number, among his disciples, spoke of it in enigmas, and encouraged the belief that he taught only what he learned in Egypt, whose Gods were considered Grecian Deities under other names. In Geometry, it was said, his teachers were the Egyptians; in Arithmetic, the Plicenicians; in Astronomy, the Chal - dt~ans; in holy things and Morcdity, the Magi.—Porphyry 6, Bitter, i. 332. But Bitter thinks that there is Tery slight evidence that he obtained much information from the Egyp - tians. “A very superficial acquaintance,” he says, “on the part of Pythagoras with Egyptian usages and opinions, is quite sufficient to account for all that is usually referred to that source.” There was, he says, so far as we can judge, a very distant resemblance between the Egyptian and Py - thagore.an symbolism. And this is truer than Ritter knew. The symbols of Pythagoras were intended to be intelligible to the Adepts alone. As interpreted by Plutarch and lam - blichus, they concealed nothing that needed concealment, and nothing that was worth concealing. All that we are told by way of explanation of his symbols never was worth remembering; and only a quack-salver would have in - vested matter so trifling with the veil of mystery, con - cealed it from the mass of his disciples, and taught it only to a few Adepts. As interpreted, his symbols concealed no creed, no doctrine whatever. No man can understand his notions as to numbers, as they are given by the writers. They are mere nonsense and jargon; and it is no wonder that men look with contempt upon the whole, wondering only how men could ever have thought that worth listening to, that meant nolilaing.

He seems to have enjoined a peculiar mode of private life on all who sought his society. . . . All the prob - able accounts on this head justify us in seeking the bond and centre of the Pythagorean community in some secret reli - gious doctrine. The Association founded by Pythagoras appears to have been a Secret Society. Several tradlitions refer to this. . . . Thei~e were certain precepts for the direc - tion of the Associates delivered, partly in symbolical apho - risms, the import of which may indeed be guessed at, but cannot be accurately given. . . . They had also certain pe - culiar ordinances to be observed in the burial of Adepts. ... We confess there is some ground for the assertion that Ihe whole system was concentrated in Mathematics and Music.” Bitter confesses that while we are justified in ass ‘irning for Pythagoras a certain degree of philosophical development, because it is natural that the religious sentiment falling in with and meeting the desire for scientific stimulus, should give rise to philosophical speculations, yet, “beyond this, we must confess entire ignorance as to what may have been the subject or the result of the philosophical labors of Py - thagoras.” And this, because Plato and Aristotle, who, of the ancient writers, were best acquainted with the doctrinal ~ystems of the earlier Philosophers, do not ascribe to him any particular philosophical theory; andi the later state. ments are worthless. The more ancient authorities speak of Pythagorean Mysteries, but not as if they were of a phio~. ~ophical character; and it is only the later ones that speaI~ of a secret philosophy of the Pythagoreans. That Pythagoras had a secret theosophy, a philosophical doctrine as to the Deity, is no longer disputable, if I have interpreted his great symbols, the lesser and greater Te. - tractys and the Mystic Triangle, correctly.

That he founded a Secret Society in any other sense than that he taught a se - cret doctrine to part of his disciples, there is as little reason to believe. But we know what his principal symbols were; they of course concealed his secret doctrine; and the only question is what that doctrine was. We have a right to suppose that it consisted of something that made it worth concealing; and it is certain that up to this time no expla. nation of the symbols has been given embodying any doc tine worth anything. If all the information that we hav.~. had, and no more, was given to an intelligent Greek, he must have deemed himself a dupe and gull, and Pythagoras an impostor; and we should have to rank him with Paracel. sus, or below him. He taught mathematics and music, we are toldi, but al that has come to us of these teachings is his notions about numbers, the peculiar properties of the right-angled tri - angle, and the relations of the musical intervals with num - bers. The Pythagorean doctrine has been transmitted to us in the shape which it had in the works of Philolaus, Eurytus and Archy-tas. These are mentioned by Aristotle; and Ar - chytas was the teacher of Epaminondas, and contemporary of Plato. The others lived about the same time; and these are the earliest Pythagoreans of whom we have any ac - count possessing the slightest title to the certainty of history. Fragments of Phiolaus have come down to us; and Plato and Aristotle had the doctrines of these men and a few others in view, in their statements of the Pythagorean philosophy. And Bitter says that, “generally speaking, it would appear that the acquaintance possessed by the an - cients with this doctrinal system was confined to the writings of Philolaus and Archytas.” “Even of the philosophical dioctrines of Philolaus little has been expressly quoted; and of all the Pythagoreans, he alone presents himself be - fore us in any degree of distinct personality. On this ac - count it is perfectly impossible to trace historically thQ ~e~de~ies ~nd aAv~nces of the Pythagorean philosophy.’?"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"90 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. As to the writers subsequent to the birth of Christ, they exhibit a strange confusion of opposite views, as to the Pythagorean philosophy, being dleceiv~d by sQpposititious works, and confoanding the dJz~rin33 of the more modern Pythagoreans with the old and genuine ones. Bitter says this, arid adds, that the symbolic mode of indication em - ployed 1 by the Pythagoreans “is capable of being taken in a variety of ways, in consequence of the very imperfect cor - respondence of the symbol and the object it stood for.” They employed the same symbol in cl~e.~ent senses; and it is far from easy to determine the particular sense they gave it in each formula respectively.” There is a sufficient rea - son for this in the certain fact that the true meaning of the original symbols had been long forgo~~en, and the modern explanations of them were conjectural. Plutarch certainly gives an utterly wrong explanation of what we familiarly call the 47th Problem. The base andi perpendicular mea - suring three and four, the hypothenuse measures five. The square of the last is equal to the squares of the first two, added together. But when we are told that the first two represent Osiris and Isis, and the last Horus, we do not see what there is in the figure or numbers to symbolize these three Deities, of whom Osiris and Isis were father and mother, and Horus son. They were not Deities worshiped by Pythagoras. His religion did not consist in the worship of the Egyptian Gods. The formula in which the Pythagoreans advanced their leading position was, “The number is the Essence (ot~iia, being) or the first principle (dpxb) of all things. This, Bitter says, can only be taken symbolically; and he in - cjuires what they understoodi by number as the Principle of things? In the fragments of Philolaus, mention constantly occurs of the essence of number. That this should be con - ceived of as one and the same with number itself, Bitter says, is naturaL In their doctrine, number comprises within itself two species, odd audi even. It is therefore the unity of these two contraries. It is the odd and the even. Also they said that one or the unit is the oddi and the even: and"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"PYTHAGORAS: HIS LIFE AND DOCTRINE. thus we arrive at the result, that one or the unit is the Essence of Number, or Number absolutely. The key to the meaning of all this is foundi in this re - mark: that, “as such, the unit is also the ground of all numbers, and is therefore. named the first one, of whose origin nothing further can be saici. In this respect the Pythagorean theory of numbers is merely an expression for ‘All is fcom the original ONE ‘~ ‘~yQjfl ~fle Being, TO WHICH, ALSO, THEY GAVE THE NAME OF GOD; for, in the words of Philolaus, ‘God contains and gives action to all, and is but One.’” The word oto~ia is identical with the Sanskrit vasu, Zend vohu, and means the very being of what a thing is. When it is said that one or the unit is the cia of number or numbers, the meaning is that it is the life, being, existence of all number and all numbers. Essentia is from esse, ‘to be,’ and St. Augustine says, sicut ab eo quod est SAPERE, vo - catur SAPIENTIA; sic ab eo guod est EssE, vocatur EssENTIA.— De Civitate, b. 12, cli. 11. And Locke says, “Essence may be taken for the very being of any thing, whereby it is,” and I should add, “is what it is.” Now, if the saying of Pythagoras, that one is the being and beginning of number, or of numbers (for it is variously given by the writers), was intendled literally and not symbolically, it was nonsense. One does not contain all other numbers, and it is in every other number, y 6 t other numbers are not made up of one, but of ones. Two, three, four, are two, three~ or four djfferent ones, together. The saying can only be true in one sense, that if there were no one, or unit, there could be no two, three or more; i. e., that every larger num - ber is an aggregate of ones. What significance had all that? Was it worth parading as a discovery or as a preg - nant truth? It seems clear that by the number One, or the Unit, Py - tliagoras symbolically represented the Divine Unity, the Oue God; and thus not only taught the pure monotheism of Zarathustra, but also his even greater doctrine, that this Divine Unity, in its Oneness, is the Being, Essence and"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"92 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. Principle of eiistence of all other Divine Hypostases, and of all intellectual beings. Bitter says: “There is nothing essential in that the Py - thagoreans denominated the primary One as number pre - eminently; but it did undeniably affordi a connecting point whereon much that wa.s essential attached itselfJ” There was certainly nothing essential in it, if what Pythagoras said of numb2rs was intended to be understood of mere abstract numbers, or numerical proportions, unconnected with persons or things. Even if he meant that certain numbers continually reappeared in nature, and that they were a law in the creation of things, this fact had no philo - sophical importance. Intrinsically, one number is no more important or valuable or more fitly a rule of formation or combination than any other number. The constant recur - rence of one number would be equally evidence of plan and design, and therefore of a Supreme Intelligence, as another. In teaching that there was One God, a Divine Unity, Being and Principle of all other Intelligences, Pythagoras struck at the very root of the religion of the State, annihi - lating the Grecian Gods and Goddesses at a blow. When he lived, this was probably more dangerous than afterward, in the time of S3crates. Therefore he taught it symboli - cally, in phrases only intelligible to the Adepts, to whom the explanation was privately confided. Mso the Pythagor~ans taught that the Decade, or number ten, •embraced every number, comprising within itself the natures of all, of the even and the odd, of the moved and unmoved, of the good and evil; and that the work and essence of number must be seen in the energy contained in the Decade. It is great, they said, perfecting all, working all, the Principle and the Director of all life, divine, heavenly, or human. Why, we are only told by a meaningless jargon. Ten is composed of one, two, three, and four, two odds, and two evens; and is embodied in the Tetractys of ten points; which, they said, expressed the essence of number, and was the root of the eternally flowing Nature.

Ten of these, then, were symbolized by the Decade and lesser Tetractys. Why ten? and what were they? In the Zarathustrian doctrine there were but seven, four male and three female. But the Hebrew Adepts, who also learned their philosophy at Baby - lon, also had the Tetractys for a Sacred Symbol, represent - ing to them the ten Sephiroth or Divine Emanations, Will, Wisdom, Understanding (the Divine Intellect in Humanity), Justice, Equity (or Rigor and Indulgence), Harmony, Glory, Victory, Stability, and Dominion; and they called these ‘NuME - RATIONS’ 0)• ‘NUMBERS.’ Now it is quite possible that this increase of the Emana - tions from Seven to Ten was made by the Magi, before the Captivity of the Hebrews, or the visit to Babylon of Py - thagoras; or he may have obtained the notion of it in Phce - nicia. This Tetractys is composed of one, two, three, and four. One, is the Divine Unity; two, the Divine Light and the Immanent Divine Wisdlom; three, these and the Divine Word; and four, the four male Am~sha ~p~’±ntas. The greater Tetractys was composed of the first four odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7; and the first four even ones, 2, 4, 6, 8, = 36, the square of 6, which is the number of the Am~sha Opentas below Cp~nta Mainyu, the Divine Intellect, which does not emanate from the Deity Ahura, but abides imma - nent in Him, not by His very Self acting outwardly in the Universe of intelligence and matter.

Evidently the One, in the unalterableness and un - changeableness of this Very Self, and His Outfiowings or Emanations. The Square and the Oblong of some of the Pythagoreans embodied some fanciful notion not now to be understood. That ‘the woric and essence of Number is to be seen in the Energy contained in the Decade,’ clearly means that the action and being of the Divine Unity and Very Self is manifested in that energy of Himself which is developed in and belongs to the Emanations represented by the Lesser Tetractys. Bitter eipresses the truth, in part and imperfectly, in say - ing (i. 368): “The Pythagoreans would seem however to have had some deeper import in assigning to the One,—notwith - standing that they regarded it as the principle of all num - bers and of all things, to the even-odd,—a place among the secondary principles or elements of things. For they wished, perhaps, to intimate thereby’, that the ground and principle of all things itself enters into the contrariety of phenomena, and is in no respect different from that out i~f which the World, in its multiplicity, is formed; but that the true essence and perfection of things have their persist - ency in it.” It is truer to say, more briefly, that the whole purpose was to teach the Eiistence of the Divine UnitI, Self-Eiistent, and the Principle and Being of all things; or,"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"PYTHAGORAS: HIS LIFE AND DOCTRrNE. 95 even more briefly, The Manifold is the varied Manifesta - tions of the One. Philolaus spoke diefinitely enough, when he said, “The Essence of things, which is Eternal, and is Nature in and of itself, admits of dliVine, but not of human cognition, unless so far as it would be impossible for any oiie of the things that are, which are imperfectly known by us, to be so known, unless the Essence (or, rather, the Very Selfuess) were con - tainedi in the things of which the World consists; of the Limiting and the Unlimited.” So Philoinus said of the Decade, and of the nature of number, that without it nothing can be known; i. e., that it is only by the Divine Unity manifesting itself by its Ema - nations, that anything in regard to IT c~n be known; and that it is the Decade which adjusts everything to the Soul; (i. e., brings them within its reach, makes them such that they are within the scope of its cognition), and renders them knowable and cognizable; so that “the nature and energy of Number (the Divinity) may be traced not only in divine and demonic things, but even in human works and words everywhere, and in all works of Art and in Music.” For as the Numbers that are symbolical of the Deity and His Emanations are found in works of Art and in the musical scale, these also are symbolical of the same Divine Unity and manifestations. “This proves most distinctly,” says Bitter (i. 369), “that to the mind of the Pythagoreans, the Divine or the First Principle of all things was a something diffusedi throughout the whole world; but that they also held it to be in itself unknowable, only revealing itseLf in mundane things as that which reconciles all to friendship, adapts them to each other, and thereby renders them knowable.” This language is sadly inaccurate and unphilosophical. They did not con - sider the First Principle to be diffused throughout the whole world, as a fluid or a spirit. “As that which reconciles all things to friendship,” should be “as that which causes all things to harmonize together by sympathy.” “It manifests itself as the Source of all bcing, and of all"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"96 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. truth; for, as Philolaus says, ‘Falsehood has no part in the Number; for it is unfriendly and hostile to its nature; but the truth is akin to and connate ~vith the family of Num - ber.~” For this, ascribed by the translator to Philolaus, read, as his real meaning: “The False is not contained in the Divine ; for it is negative, and as such contrary to the esseutial nature of the Divine; but the TrQe is akin to and emanates with the outilo~vings of the Divine.” Cicero, De Nat. Deor. i. U, says, “Pythagoras thought that God was the Mind exerting itself through the entire nature of things, and therein frequenting; from which our minds are taken by severance. Ritter thinks that the Pythagoreans likewise posited a Principle of imperfection in the Limitless, or Infinite, which Philolaus calls also the Irrational and Unintelligent; and says of it that falsehood and envy reside in it. His words, as quoted by Stobceus, are, r~; yap a~zreipw c~voqrw aA6yw (pvcYLo; r6 ~beb6o; ~uA ~ qOcvo~ evrz; which seem to me to mean ‘for in the Infinite (Limitless or Indeterminate) and Irrational and fllogical of Nature are the False and Nega - tive.’ I do not think that there is sufficient warrant for saying that we must, according to their mode of representation, look upon the first ground (Principle) of all things as the Source, not only of the perfect, but also of the imperfect; and that not only the perfect, but the imperfect also, were in the First One Darkness cannot flow out of Light. The out- flowing of Light is Light. So Evil cannot flow from the Good. The O~ does not create nor is the Source of either Darkness or Evil. These are negations, having no Source. If the Deity, being the Essence of Light, had once not ex - isted, there would have been Darkness; for it is merely the absence of Light In the e’v”oqrco and tyro we recognize the Ak6-Man6, Unreason, Irrationality, of the Zend-Avesta, antagonist of Vohu-Man\\ the Divine Reason, uttered in Man.

Of course, the First Principle was THE FrusT. In and of this First Principle, the Being of all, is the Divine Mind or Intellect. It is, there - fore, One and Two; and it is Three, because the Divine In~ tellect, uttering itself, manifesting itself, in the Universe of things and beings, is the •WoRD; and these three are one, and both Even and Odd. Philolaus begins the exposition of his own doctrine by an attempt to show that all must consist of the limitingi i.e., Ritter says, of the limit and the limitless. The Pythago - reans said that whatever can be known must be limited, having beginning, middle and end. The beginning and the end are naturally the limiting, i. e., the limits ; but the mid - dle the unlimited; which, Ritter says, they seem also to have inferred from this, that the middle between the limits may be divided ad ir~/i;2itum. Phiolaus speaks of ‘limit - ing things,’ ~vhich, in tho corporeal, are ultimately spacial points, called by the Pythagoreans units or monads. Aris - totle says, “To some, indeed, the limits of body, such as, the surface, the line, the point, the monad, seem to be reali - ties, indeed more so than the body and the solid.” Manifestation by form is by means of limitation. If we conceive of the Deity, as all the ancients did, as limitless unmanifested Essence of Light, an orb, which is a manifes - tation of this light, a body, is so by being limited in form. Conceive of its circumference as a boundary which contains the light that is the orb within it, a band or tire around it, and you have the Kabalistic idea of limitation. They con - ceived of the limit as a somewhat real, a hoop, band, or tire, but without width, a line extended, confining within itself, by bounding, the light or the matter composing or being the orb or body. God is the limitless. His inanifes - tations are ~he limited. But I return to Ritter’s explanation. “The Pythagoreans held numbers to be the principle of things, because to them the Primary and the Incomposite appeared to be the Principle: now, the Primary of bodies is surfaces; the Primary of a surfaoe, lines; of the line, points, which they called units or monads; which, perfectly 7"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"98 THmTY-SECONT I~EGRE~. incornposite, have nothing antecedent or simpler; but as units are numbers, numbers must necessarily be the pm - cipifi of thiii~s.” This notion is ascribed by the modern Greek writer from whom he quotes it, to Plato as well as’ Pyth Jtgoras. The Limiting, he thinks, was, to the Pythagoreans, in reference to things corporeal, nothing but a multit~ide of points, somehow held together in space; and the proposI - tion, .‘ All thitigs consist of the numbers existing in them,’ is, in other words, ‘All things are composed of points, or spa - cial units, which taken together constitute a number.’ ‘Magiiitude first arises from numbers, which signify points. These units a~re so far from being bodies, that they are not eveii magnitii des, but merely the limits of magnitude— points.’ And the intermediate space or vacuum between them is the Unlimited. The units are, in themselves, strictly geoittctrical points, therefore incorporeal. No number of such points conjoined could produce a body or even a line. Therefore extension only becomes possible by the inter - vention between them of the Unlimited—Space, intervals. Points, put together at certain intervals, produce the line; lines, put together at different intervals, produce the sur - face; surfaces, put together at different intervals, produce a body extended in three dimensions. And so Aristotle could justly say, in conformity w.ith the Pythagorean doctrine, that corporeal magnitude resulted, in the first instance, from that of tlit’ limit or the unit, and out of the unlimited or the inter - val. He says, also, in express terms, ‘According to the Py - thagoreans, the void first separates the numbers, and deter - mim’s their nature, as likewise it does the place of things.’ Thus the septbration of numbers or units is brought about by ~~i.cuum, or, what is the same, the numbers are first produced by the vacuum. The void being a Principle of numbers, and numbers being the principles of things, it is clear that the Pythagoreans held vacuum to be a principle of things. The unlimited, Aristotle says, is the Even, and is attracted, drawn in, and bounded by the Limiting. The vacuum (intervals’) was the Unlimited. Thus they made"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"PYTHAGoRAS: HIS LrFE AND DOCTRINE. 9~j the corporeal existence of the world be composed of points and a vacuum. If we could believe that this was the teaching of Pytha - goras, we should wonder how lie could imagine that it was of any value. The Unit or Point, being unextended, not even so much of space, however minute, is nothing, pre - cisely as the interval is. The line, then, is space, without width, that is, an imaginary line severing two parts of a surface that has no thickness, and therefore is no space; and the point is the ending of this line. Nothing more nonsensical than the whole of this can be couc~ived of. A point, being nothing, cannot divide a line into intervals; n~r can there be intervals between two nothings. Only a body, extended, can break the continuity of space; and one stares in amazement at the notion of a solid, composed of imaginary points and a certain quantity of space bounded by surfaces composed of imaginary lines, in their turn com - posed of imaginary points, each point and line nothing. Ritter admits that ‘at the first view it may appear singu - lar that, according to this doctrine, the Pythagoreans should have conceived the corporeal existence of the world as com - posed of vacuum;’ but says that ‘when we examine more closely the whole spirit of this doctrine, we shall soon be able to comprehend the mode by which they arrived at it. An ideal tendency in it is not to be mistaken.’ Essentially, he says, it comes to this: the elimination of the matter of the corporeal, and contrariwise the retention of the]brm as the only true. The points determine the form. The infini - ty of the indeterminate matter, which only first assumes a form by means of the limiting by the points, ‘is represented as the Negative nothingly in space—the Yoid.’ But how is matter,’never so indeterminate, represented as void space? According to the ‘doctrine,’ it is the space, limited by points, that becomes lines, surfaces and bodies; that is, matter having form. •You cannot carve out a piece of ~paee by points, forming lines of surfaces that bound it, and make matter or a body of it; and the idea that it can be - come matter or abody becomes more absurd when these limit-"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"100 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. ings are expressly stated to be composed of points unex - tended and intervals of void space between them. Pytha - goras never entertained and juggled ~vitli notions so idle as these, or rather with words that represented not even a notion. This babble of words was resorted to by men of much later times than his, to explain or develop concep - tions clear and distinct and rational to him, but which, con - cealed in symbolic sayings about numbers, were no longer understood. Zarathustra had no theory in regard to the origin of the material world, or matter. Ahura Mazda is called by a word that is, with perhaps doubtful propriety, rendered by ‘Creator;’ and the translations make him ‘creator’ of certain regions inhabited by the Aryans; but nothing is said of his crcatinj any countries except those which the Aryans conquered; and the meaning of the phrases used sccms rather to be that he cs!aWsked the Aryan people in those lands. At any rate, as to the manner of ‘creating,’ there is not a word. I do not think that Pythagoras had any theory of the origin of the material world. He did not teach, as the Hebrew Book Barasith did, that, at the begin - ning of the Heavens or Upper regions and the Earth, what is now the Earth was Taliav and Bahav, or Tahu and Bahu, sha~eless an(l chaotic, and that the Rukh Alohayim brooded on the surface of the waters; or, like the later Vedic Hymns, that Virile Pot3ncy placed itself upon and impregnated the chaos of matter. He did not teach that, by the energy of the Divine will, matter became where before nothing was; nor that matter was evolved or flowed forth from or was produced by the Deity. He did not ‘eliminate the matter of the corporeal, and retain the form as the alone true;’ or ropresent Spirit or Force as causing, producing or becom - ing matter. He certainly did not conceive of The One, lim - itless, as taking form and manifesting Itself as matter. Ritter thinks that the Pythagoreans “had a secret feeling of the weakness of this part of their theory, which they sought to hide from themselves, by concealing their notion of the Infinite behind manifold forced applications.” The"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"PYTHAGORAS: HIS LIFE AND DOCTRINE. 101 ancients have transmitted to us, Stobt~us says, a state - ment that the Pythagoreans taught that the world had not really any origin in time, but only apparently so to hu - man thought. “THE ONE of the Pythagoreans was supposed primarily to be something perfectly inseparate, a continuous and indivisi - ble Magnitude, in which there was an inherent faculty to dissolve Itself, by the mediation of the separative void space, into a multiplicity of things.”—Ritter, i. 386. It, then, dis - solved itself into an infinity of points, each not matter, or a body, or spirit, or having magnitude, dimensions or exten - sion. As each of these was simply nothing, their aggregate was nothing. Did not Deity, then, by dissolving, annihi - late Himself? “The true Entity, the Perfect of things, had in the Limit its sole and only ground. This, on the one hand, they con - ceived to be Unity; and, on the other hand, the true ground of multiplicity. It represented the self-determined Unity of the World, the all-embracing; and as such the One, as the ground of all things, is celebrated as God, ruling and guiding all, One, Only, and Eternal, persisting and un - moved, without change, life itself, and different from all else.” This last clause is from Philo, De Mundi Opific. (i. 24), 33, quoted by him from Philolaus; and is translated by Yonge, “For God,” he says, “is the Ruler (5 4yepc~v, Chief, Sovereign) and Lord ~ Ruler, Governor) of all things, being one (e!; c~e~ ~c~’-, One, always being), lasting, t#io;, stable, permanent), immovable (c~n ivqro ~, without motion;” which means that He does not manifest His Self out of Himself by Emanation), Himself like to Himself, and different from (i~repo~, other than) all others. Philo, Quod Dens immutabilis, 6, calls God ‘the Father, Architect’ or ‘Maker’ (rexi’ir~,;) and ‘Carer for the things in Heaven and Earth,’ and the Demiourgos of Time, for He is Father of its Father, and the World (Kosmos) is Father of Time; and this World the younger Son of God.

Supreme God; for the primary principles are united in the original Unity of God, in the Odd-Even, in the primary Number, siiu~ the living development of the whole heaven or world has been from the beginning. Hence the whole Heaven is Number, and Number the Essence (Being) of things; and the Triad comprises the Numbers of The All, since it has within it beginning, middle and end. In whatever sense this language may have been used by the later Pythagoreahas, so much of it as Pythagoras himself ubed related, not to the world at large, to the material world, but to the One and its Emanations, to the Mind or Intellect, and the Life and Action, of the Universe. The Triad comprises all the Divine Potencies and Energies, whether immediately acting, or mediately through Nature and as Powers of Nature; and this Triad, of the Very God, Essence or SQbstance of Light and Life, the Divine Wisdom in this Very God, and the Divine Word, this Divine Wisdom uttered and expressed in the Intellect of Man and other l)eings, is the Beginning, the Middle and the End. And it is this ALL, which ‘proceeds from the original ONE or primary NUMBER, or from the plurality (seven or ten) of Units or Numbers’ (Emanations, Am~sha §‘p~ntas or Sephiroth), ‘into which the ONE, in its life-development, divides itself.’ ‘The Pythagoreans,’ Philo says, before quoting Philolaus, as above, ‘compare the Number Seven to the Ruler of all things. . . . The only thing that neither moves nor is moved is the Most Ancient Ruler and Chief, of whom the Number Seven may pertinently be called an image’ (ei~cu i’, ‘likeness, semblance, image’). Diogenes Laertius (lib. viii., ch. i., Pythagoras, sec. 19, § 25), says of the doctrine of Pythagoras, that he taught that the beginning of all things was the Monad; and from the Monad the unlimited Duad, to be sub-posited, as Matter [the principle of material being], perhaps, to the Monad that is its Originator; and from the Monad and unlimited Duad, the Numbers; and from the Numbers, points; from the points, lines; from the lines, surfaces; from the sur - faces, figutes with sides; and from these, solids.

He assumes, it is said there, four degrees of life; “1~, the Existence that comes to all creatures—propagation with their organs; 20, that of plants, to which a root and growth and the navel as an organ are ascribed; 30, the life of animals, to whom sen - sation and a soul and the heart as an organ belongs; and lastly that of man, in whom resides reason, and whose or - gans are the head and brain.” The passage really reads: ‘And there are four beginnings of rational life, as Philolaus also in his Book about Nature says; the brain, heart, navel, and genital member (ai6o7ov); the head, of the intellect (v 3 &); the heart, of the vital soul and of sense; the navel, of radication and reproduction; the genital member, of deposit"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"104 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. of the seed and generation; and the brain is the Principium of man; the heart of what lives; the navel of what grows (the plant); and the virile organ, of all alike.’ But, to return, Ritter says (i. 406), “As they could not well fail to refer all the appearances of indlividual Soul-life to the universal ensonling Energy of the world, so it is also placed beyond doubt that all souls were with them merely an outfiowing of the Universal Soul.” Plutarch, De Placitis Philosoph. i. 7, to whom he refers without quoting, says: ‘Pythagoras and Plato held that the Soul was indestructi - ble, for that going forth (from the body) it returns to the Soul of the Whole, to that which is of the same origin with itself (,rpS; rr~ 6 kLoyE i4;).’ But the word here rendered Soul is i”xb, which does not mean the Intellect or Mind, but the Vital Soul, or Life. Cicero, however (Nat. Deorum, i. 11), as we have seen, does tell us that Pythagoras thought that the Mind (animus) was diffused through andi traversed all Nature, but he adds, ‘he did not see that by the seve - rance of the human Souls God was torn and lacerated, and that when these Souls might be wretched, which chances to many, Then part of God would be wretched; which can - not be.’ In Stoba~us we find the later formula, ‘The Soul comes into the body from without;’ and Claudian says, ‘The Soul is placed in the body by Number, and a conformity immor - tal and incorporeal.’ Ritter thinks ‘it will at least be in the spirit of the Pythagorean theory, if we consider the Soul to be that numerical relation which forms its body har - monically;’ according to which ‘the Soul would be incorpo - real, as also the Pythagorean Numbers are incorporeal as grounds of the corporeal.’ The word “ground” and “grounds,” here and elsewhere, is used, n~t to express defi - nitely what other words fail to express. but to conceal the want of a definite notion. Thus, according to Ritter’s view, the Soul became, to the later Pythagoreans, a numerical relation; i. e., as 3 is to 5, that is the Soul. It would be no more absurd to say that they thought the Soul an interval between two points, in"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"PYTHAGoRA5: HIS LIFE AND DOCTRINE. 105 that imaginary world where Space is the Limitless and Un - limited when it is limited by points into intervals that are vacua, and points are the Limiting, because they have no dimensions, occupy no space, and are simply nothing. The doctrine is ascribed to Philolaus, according to Ritter, that the mathematical intellect is the criterion of truth. He cites Sextus Empiricus, whose works I have not, but I am quite sure that the “ mathematical intellect” does not ex - press the sense of the original. ‘That is,’ he adds, ‘that Num - ber and Harmony are the sources of all truth; and if they were not in things, there would be nothing true to be known. These in perception bring things to the Soul, for the Or - ganic exists only by harmony of numbers; and although we are unable to have knowledge of the Source of all truth, the Eternal Substance and Nature of things, in and. by It - self absolutely, we may yet gain a glimpse of it in things, by means of the senses and of reason. The latter part of this we may understand. It is pre - cisely what is said by Paul, in his letter to the Roman Christians: ‘That which may be known of God is manifest in them ; for, since the creation of the world, the Invisible of Him is clearly seen, being cognizable by His works ; that is, His Eternal Power and Divinity.” But the first portion of it is without dlefinite meaning, if we read it literally. What was meant by its phrases, at the beginning, probably was, that if the Essential Being of the Deity did not enter into things and there were not conformity or fitness between It and the things in which It abides and acts, there would be no reality of which there could be cognition; thus number and conformity, or harmony are the sources of the Real in the world. It cannot be denied, says Ritter, that the Pythagoreans were led away by the wildest imagination, and indulged in the most extravagant plays of fancy. In their expositions and intended illustrations of the ideas which Pythagoras taught symbolicajly by what he said in regard to numbers, they so ~vandered as often to lose themselves entirely, and it is impossible to interpret their fancies by the original ideas."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"106 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. Regarding numbers as numbers merely, and not as symbols, they indulged in fancies in regard to them as numbers merely, that had no relation at all to the theory which they represented. In Number as a mere relation of units, they deemed the essence of things to lie; and this, taken literally, was simple nonsense. When ~hiey referred these back to the first Unit, the Principle of being of Number, they saw in - distinctly what Number symbolized, and wandered off again. This Unit, they said, was the Life-Principle of the world, evolving multiplicity out of itself, and so was the cause of all relations of congruity and harmony; but still seeing in it only Number, only the Unit of Number, and the Divine Unity represented by the Unit of Number, they wandered off into empty idle speculation, and have left us only jar - gon, and confusion, worse confounded by those who have endeavored to understand their nonsense; among whom not the least is Dr. Ritter. HERMES. HERMES, the God who presides over language, was for - merly very properly considered as common to aZl Priests; and the Power who presides over the true knowledge concerning the Gods, is one and the same in the whole of things.

But it must be remembered that Hermes (Epjii~;) is not an Egyptian Name or Word, but Greek. The Greeks gave it to Thoth or Taatd, the Ibis-headed Deity, who, in the judg - ment-scene in Amenthe, stands beside the Scales, and notes the result of the weighing, by Osiris, Horus, and Anubis, of the moral character of the Dead, in one scale, against the Goddess of Truth in the other. This Thoth or Tat or Thoyth (meaning in Coptic a column or st~l~), is said to have been known to the Ph~nicians as Taut, and to have had with them the same character of Inventor of Letters. Cicero calls him the Fifth Mercury. It was the Greeks who made him the inventor of Gymnastics. Plato spoke of him as either a God or a divine man. The knowleclg3 possessed by the Sacerdotal Caste in Egypt was comprised in forty-two books, ascribed to Thoth. lam - blichus calls Hermes the God who presided over language, and the true knowledge concerning the Gods; and says, ‘Henc3 our ancestors dedicated to him the inventions of their wisdom, inscribing all their own commentaries with the name of Hermes.’ Scheible says that the Egyptian Priests called Musah (Moses) ‘Hermes,’ on account of his interpretation of the Holy Writings; but this is mere fic - tion. Borrichius says that it is the teachings of Hermes (the Divine Wisdom) to the Priests, which we reverence in the Mosaic Law. This also is a mere fiction. There is no philosophical or religious doctrine in the Mosaic Law, as there is nothing in it borrowed from Egypt, and as there is no intermixture of Egyptian in the Hebrew language, all the Jewish writings containing hardly half a dozen Egyp - tian words.

He has written books, and very many, to be sure, which belong to the knowl - edge of divine things, in which lie confesses the Majesty of the Great and Only God, and calls him, by such name as we do, God and Father.’ Porphyry says that Taaut, whom the Egyptians name ThGth, surpassing in wisdom all the Phcenicians, first set in order what pertained to the worship of God, out of the ignorance of the herd, into scientific practical skill. The Thracian Princes worship Hermes most among the Gods; and they swear an oath by him alone, and say that they are born from Hermes. The Pelasgians told a certain sacred story concerning him; the things which in the Sa - mothracian Mysteries are shown forth. Oharas, C’/wres, Xoras, Kiwos and Chamah are said to be names of the Sun. In the Sanskrit, Han means ‘tawny-yel - low, the Sun, a ray of light, fire;’ Kor, Kur, are constantly said to be the Sun; and from it, it is supposed, came the Greek word Kurios, ‘Lord;’ which is also said to be from Kuroq, authority. I do not find Kor, .Kur, Khor or R7n~r, with any such meaning, in the Sanskrit. The Kurus, said to have descended from Kuru, supposed to haie been a tribe or race of the Indo-Aryans, were ‘singers, chaunters,’ from Kur, ‘to sound, sing, chaunt.’ It is probably the ori - gin of the name Kuros (Cyrus); while Khairom and Khurom are from the root ~ (K/nj, ‘noble,’ whence ~j¶~fl (Kkirah), ‘nobility;’ ~ (KAur), ‘white, an opening, a window.’ And this is perhaps the Phc~nician root of the name Hermes.

It purports to have been written by Aristo - teles, bu~ evidently belongs to that period of Neo-Platonism when the doctrine of Aristoteles came again into favor.

He is called the Supreme Light, in the impossibility of discovering His Essence (or Essential Nature). If He had not emerged from the pro - fundities of His Essence, nothing but Himself would exist; but He could not remain solitary and impotent. It was necessary that the light which escaped from the divine centre should find where to become fixed. The Author of time does not create in time; the act of creation is co-eter - nal with God; is inseparable from Him as the shadow is from the body which it accompanies. He creates by a sys - tem of successive hypostases. The Active Intelligence is the first creation of God. This is the Divine WORD, the image of the pure and absolute .Unity, contemplating Its Self. By the Word, God has cre - ated. Intelligence is the Very Word of God. This Intel - ligence contains and preserves the universal essences of things. In this sense it contains all, i~ all. But it contains all, under the form of the Universal. All that from the world known to the senses reascends into the Intelligence, re-enters into it, only’by losing its particularity and retak - ing its universality. The Author of the Theology represents the Intelligence, sometimes as the centre of a circle, sometimes as the circle entire. As the centre, a point indivisible and without dimensions, virtually comprehends all the parts of the cir - cle, angles, sides, surfaces, lines, so the Intelligence, indivi - sible Unity, ideally contains all things.

The first and only immediate production of the Intelli - gence (Intellect us) is Vitality (Anima). It is, by its essence, inseparable from the Intelligence, but in its operations de - taches itself. As all existences under the Intellect are ‘in the Intellect’s Self, through the Reason, so also all animated creatures are universals in the Universal Anima, through Reason. It creates bodies, to make them the seats of its developments, and as God produces the Intellect, and the Intellect under the inBuence of the first Cause produces the Vital Soul, so the Vital Soul produces Nature, under the double influence of the Intellect and God. Nature is the immediate cause of all individuality in the world known to the senses. So everything emanates directly or indirectly from the First Cause; and Beings form a grand hierarchy of Essences so much less simple and pure as they are far - ~her removed from their Principle. The influence of God is universal, as the light of the Sun; only each being receives it according to its capacity, as each object is lighted accord - ing to its degree of visibility.— Vackerot, Hist. Urit. de ~‘tcole d’Alex. iii. 86 to 95. Prior to beings substantively existing and to Universals (or Universal principles), there is one God, First, and of the First God and King, immovable, and dwelling in the solitude of His own Unity. For neither does intellectuality nor anything else attain unto connection with Him; but He subsists permanently as the model of the Deity who is Fa - ther of Himself, is self-begotten, is sole Author, and the Veritable Essential Good. For He is somewhat even greater than and prior to this Deity, is the Source of all things, and the origin of the first form cognizable by the Intellect. And from this Divine Unity, the God Sufficient unto Himself unfolds Himself into Light. For this (self-unfolded) Deity, also, in the Principle and the God of Gods, is a unit (Monad) from the One, prior to Essence, and the Principle of Essence. For from Him both Being and Essence flow, and hence, also, He is denominated the Principle of Intelligibles."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"~EEMES. 111 These, therefore, are the most ancient Principles of all things, which Hermes places prior to the Ethereal, Em - pyre~n and Celestial Deities.—Iarnblichus, On the Mysteries, sec. viii., ch. ii.

THE Sages of all the ancient races had a Secret and Holy Doctrine which was not made known to the People at large. When these worshiped the Star, the Sages adored that which manifested itself as the Star. When these worshiped the Fire and Light, the Sages worshiped the Invisible Principle from which the Light flowed out. “They who serve even other Gods with a firm belief,” it is said in a Hindu Sacred Book, “in doing so, involuntarily worship me. I am He who partaketh of all worship, and I am their reward.” “Unto God ye shall all return, and then He will declare unto you that concerning which ye have disagreed,” it is said in the Koran. Even in Mohammedanism there was and is a secret doctrine, very probably that of Mohammed himself. It was the doc - trine of the Kabalah. On the death of the Prophet, his follow - ers divided into two sects, that of Abubeker and that of Au; and the faith of the latter became and still continues to be the religion of Persia. This originally contained the esoteric religion of Mohammed, which is still to be found in the sect of the Sophees or Sufis, which from the year 1500 to 1736 ruled Persia.

These esoteric doctrines were like those of Plato, Or - pheus, the Hindus, and the Kabalah, as to emanation of all fro~.m the undiscoverable Source, the To o” or AINSOPH. Sufism is divided into four stages. The first is that of ritual and ceremonial; the second, that of Power or Force; the third, that of Wisdom ; the fourth, that of Truth. The third of these is Inspiration, the fourth, complete union with the Divinity. The Sufis hold that God is diffused over all His creation, existing every~vhere and in everything. They compar& His Emanations, the outfiowings from His Essence or Spirit, to the rays of the Sun, continually darted forth and re-absorbed; and they believe that the Soul of Man, and the principle of life which exists throughout all nature, are not from God, but of Goi They have a mode of Initiation, in which the Candidate passes symbolically through these four stages in succes - sion. They involve their tenets in mystery; and in every stage or degree there are secrets which are never revealed to the Profane, to reveal which would be an immense crime. One of their most learned works teaches that all nature abounds with Divine love. The same faith and sect have flourished for centuries in India. Their principal tenets are, that nothing exists absolutely, but God; that the human soul is an Emanation from His essence, and though for a time divided from its heavenly source, will finally be re - united with it, a reunion which should be man’s sole object and desire. Of course we have hints only of the secret doctrine; but enough is disclosed to reveal its identity with that of the Gnostics and the Kabalah, in their leading prin - ciples.

Hence necessarily happened two things— one, that religion often changed; the other that the Ka - balists were in great esteem, because necessary men. The Kabalistic doctrine of creation by generation not only finds its warrant in the language of the Hebrew books, but evidently obtained among all the ancient nations.

In the later period of the Vedic age, Desire was said to have in the beginning brooded upon the dark chaos of form - less matter.

The Peruvians had no one God in three and three in one. Mithra was not a tri-une God. The Zarathustrian Trinity, of the Supreme Light, Creator of all, the Divine Wisdom, and the Utterance of the Divine Wisdom in the Universe and Humanity, had nothing in common with the mere Triads of Gods, such as Zeus, Poseidon and Pluto, or Odin and the other two sons of B~r (Vili and Ye), or the three mighty benevolent Gods, Odin, Hcenir and Lodur.

Mter remaining in this egg, a year of BrahmA (3,110,400,000 of our years), He, Brahms, divided the egg, and it became the Heavens and the Earth. ‘From the Supreme Soul He drew forth Mind, existing by its nature, though not perceptible by sense, immaterial; and before Mind or the Reasoning Power, He produced Self-consciousness, the internal Counsellor and Ruler; and the great intellectual Principle, the Soul, or first expansion of the Divine Idea.

Those who ridicule the old philosophies will do well to reflect how else God could have made man after His own image; how, otherwise, anything of the Divine could mingle with the Human; how else we could be entitled to rely im - plicitly on our consciousness, or to trust at all to our Reason; and. whether it is more sensible and philosophical to imagine that consciousness and reason were created out of nothing, or are, like tast.~ and smell, the effects of physical organization, than to suppose them so much of the Divine intermingling with the human. Each human being, also, is a Microcosm or little Universe, as the Kabalists also held, the Soul consisting of three dis - tinct -parts, and yet being but one. Such, also, in later times, was the doctrine of the Hermetic philosophers and the Mchemists. And therefore, as the Universe is in such manner divine, the Hindus held that so long as Brahm~ is awake, the world or Universe has its full expansion; but when He slumbers, the~whole system fades a-wa-v. Then every soul, as it had emanated from Him, is absorbed into His essence; all things are resolved into their first principles; and the world, His visible image, ceases to exist until He awakes from His placid slumber, and a new order of things commences, exactly similar to that which had preceded it. Mansell, in his work on the Limits of religious thought, has demonstrated that we can have no conception whatever of the Infinite; and that God, as the Absolute, is but a mere word without m~aning to us. This is to demonstrate that the old philosophical ideas are correct, whenever their meaning is penetrated into. Misunderstood, they bred mull - titudinous errors."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"124 TE~rY-SECONfl DEGREE. The Hebrew Kabalists divided the ten Sephiroth, Nu - merations or Emanations of the Very God, thus: I. Kether (Katar), Corona; The Divine Will. II. Chochmah, Binah (Khakemah, Bainah), Sapientia and Intel ligentia, Wisdom and Understanding. III. Gedulah, Geburah, Tephereth; Magnificentia, iRigor, Pulchritudo; Magnificence or Benignity (Khased), Severity, Beauty. IV. Netsach, Hud, Vesod, Malkuth (Netsakh, Had, Ye - sQd, Malak~th), Superatio, Gloria, Fundamentum, Regnuin; Victory, Glory, Stability, Dominion. And they represented Khakemah and Bainab, the Divine Wisdom in God, and the same Divine Wisdom as the Human Intellect, as forming a Triad with their product DAth, Thinking, Intellection. But, indeed, Gedulah means ‘Greatness, Majesty;’ Ge - burah, ‘Strength, Might, Power;’ and Teparat, ‘Splendor.’ H~d is Majesty, Splendor, Vigor, Beauty; Netsakh, Splen - dor, Sincerity, Truth, Faith, Perpetuity, Eternity, Perfec - tion. Yesfid is Foundation, Beginning. But the whole Kabalistic doctrine is based upon the meanings ascribed to each by the corresponding Latin word. The whole is called the Mystery of the Balance; and the Siphra de Zeniutha, or Book of Occvltation, treats of the equi - libration of the Balance: of opposites in equilibrium, by means of the Single Wisdom that is above both. In the Jewish religion, as in all others, there were an esoteric and an exoteric meaning of its legends and dogmas. Most of the ancient Jewish philosophers and Christian fa - thers regarded the Book of Genesis as symbolic and allego - rical. Maimonides says, “Not all t.hings are to be under - stood and accep~ted literally, that are contained in the Book Barasith, as the vulgar imagine.” He says that there for - merly were among the Hebrews many mysteries of Divine things, which now have perished, either by the effect of time, or of the national calamities, or because it was for - kidden to c9mmit the Divine m~rsteries to writing. It wa~"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL sEcRET. 125 not permissible to reduce anything to writing, except such things as were digestedi and set forth in the Sacred Books. Formerly the Talmud was not written, in consequence of ‘C the received maxim, Verbct quce clixi /i5i ore, non licet tibi scripto divulgcLre.” The ancient recd Kabalah, he says, dealt with the origin and gradation of things, or the modle of production or out-flowing of things from the first Entity, and the degrees and descent of the same things from the highest to the lowest. The Sacredi Book of the Chinese, calledi Y-King, or the Book of Y, represented the Divine Mystery by that hiero - glyphic. Y, it says, has neither body nor figure; and all which have body and figure were made by that which has neither. It is the Great Unity, and comprehendis three, the one being three, and the three one. Tao, it informs us, is Existence; the first has proclieced the second; the two have pro— cluced the third; and the three have made all things. He whom the i~pirit perceiveth, and whom the eye cannot see, is called Y. And Hiu-Chin thus explains this character: “At the first beginning, Reason subsisted in the Unity; that is it, which made and divided the Heaven and the Earth, which changed and per - fec/ed all things.” This REASON, at first subsisting in the Unity, was manifested as the Soul or Intellectual Principle of the Universe. It is the First-begotten of the Gnostics, the Woiw, which was in the beginning with God andi was God, and by which everything was created. So, according to the doctrine of Orpheus, says Cedrenus, from the Christian Chronographer Timotheus, there was, before the beginning of things, a Being incomprehensible, supreme, and self-existent, Creator of all things, the LIGHT, above all things. “His name is WIsDOM, LIGHT and Lw~; but these three powers are one power; the strength of which is the invisible, the incomprehensible God.” “All things were created by the three Names of the one only God; and He is all things.” In the Orphic Argonautics the poet sings “the immense necessity of ancient chaos; and Kronos, who produced the vast tracts of ether; and Eros, the parent of eternal night, ii"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"126 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. famed on account of his double nature, whom more recent mortals call Ph~in~s “—“ wise Eros, the most ancient, the Perfecter of the Universe, who produced all things, and separated each from the other.” Here Eros or PhAn~s, Love, is declared to be the Divine Demiourgic power. With huin is associated Krdnos as the Destroyer. The Or - phic Triad, of Eros, Ouranos and Kronos, is declared by Proclus to be the same as the three Demiourgic Intelli - gences of the Platonist Aurelius, and these as Plato’s three Kings. Krishna is hrish j- na, ‘erotic pleasure.’ Although the sayings ascribedi to Orpheus, like those ascribed to Hernies and those, not in the Zend Avesta, to Zoroaster, are apocryphal, written by Greeks of a much later age, yet they may fairly be snpposed to contain very ancient notions, current at the time, and ascribed to Think - ers of a remote past, actual like Zarathustra, or mythic like Orpheus and Hermes. T3 “0i’, ‘that which is,’ the Source of Emanation, was a Point, the centre of a Circle whose circumference was no - where, and its centre everywhere. This was styled the Huri~p ‘L4yvc.,o~ro:, the Unknown Father or Generator. From Him everything has emanated, and everything will some day return into His bosom. What is the meaning of the phrase in the Book of Luke, “Abraham’s bosom,” in which Lazarus lay after death? Is it the bosom of Brahma, the primal Source of being? The first and most profound Secret of the Kabalah, the Gnsis, and the other ancient doctrines, was the Cosmogony or Creation. By what argument shall we prove the essen - tial immortality of the human Soul, if it was created out of nothing, and its existence therefore must needs depend on the good pleasure of the Deity? Qnly God Himself can be essentially immortal. Of course it js quite impossible to form any idea of the mode in which the Deity brings either mind or matter into existence. The generation or begetting of things is but a symbolic phrase, vainly imagined to explain what is wholly beyond our comprehension. How can it explain the effluence of Thought from the Soul, or the pro-"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL SECRET. 127 duction of Act by the Will? Is Thought a thing or sub - stance that can be or exist? We have not the least concep - tion what it is, as distinct and dbstingiiished. from the Soul itself. It is, the Sages said, the gleani or ray of light shot forth or flowing forth from the Soul, and by which alone the Soul is manifested, or any cognizance of it had. So, the Sages Saidi, the Divine Thought or Idea emanates as the Creative Logos, from the profound abyss in which the Unknown God was, is and ever will be concealed. He is the Essence, of which Light is a manifestedi attribute. Language, as well as symbols, was used to conceal the Secret Doctrine as to the First Cause and the Creation. In Philo, pass ~g’es in direct contradiction to each other may be fouud, for the evident purpose of concealment. The whole school of Plato used this practice; and Plato him - self maintain3d doctrines in direct antagonism to each other, so that only the Initiatedl might understand him. The Tim~us, particularly, is completely confused.. He says that his doctrines are the 1ra’AaLo~ .uai [epo~ Aoyoi, the an - tique and holy words. The attributes of the Supreme God or Unknown Father, perhaps in order to mislead the uninitiated, were often ascribed to the second and third Emanations; as they were, in Egypt to Isis, and in Greece to Persephon4. The latter Goddess (daughter of Ceres and wife of Pluto), was styled by Orpheus (in his hymn ei; Tftpoeq5viv, Zc~ .i~ai Oc~vcr - ro;, ‘both Life and Death’).

Rather, the Idlea formedi in the infi - nite Intelligence, was the Universe, as it was to be mani - fested in time and space—was as really the Universe itself, as the Deity is really the Deity. The Thought i.? the Word, though as yet unutteredi. By this intelligible and incor - poreal Idea, says Philo, Godi framed, by His Logos, the corporeal World, according to the Pythagorean system of numbers The Hebrews had had these d9ctrines from the most early times. Philo says they were entertained by Moses. We find the same notions ascribed to Orpheus, Hermes and Zoroaster. But Orpheus and Hermes were personifications of the Divine Intellect, and not men, and the writings as - cribed to them are neither genuine nor very old; and Zarathustra taught nothing in regard to the creation or origin of things. His doctrine of Emanation didi not include matter. The notion of the incarnation of the Word, Logos or D~mi - ourgos was comparatively modern. The MASAYAH (anointed one) expected by the Hebrews, was not an expected Incar - nation of the Deity. The Avatars or incarnations of Vishi~u became a part of the Indian mythology two or three thou - sand years after the Vedic period; and the expected Saviour of the Persians, Sosiosch, was ( 3 ?a6shyan~, a Chief who aided Zarathustra to expel the Tatars (Drukhs) from Bactria. Zarathustra taught that VohumanC, the Divine Wisdom manifesting itself as intellect, was the author of all good thoughts and words; but he taught no other incarnation or inspiration. Yet there is no doubt that all over the Orient, shortly before the beginning of our era, there was a general expectation of another Incarnation, of the advent of a Re - deemer and Mediator. We are not allowed to doubt that the Christinn religion, also, originally had a secret and allegorical meaning; since this is clearly acknowledged, again and again, and spoken of as a fact universally admitted, by Justin Martyr, Clemens of Alexandria, Origen, and all the other very early Fathers of the church. Clemens say& that this Secret Doctrine was -4"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL SECRET. communicated by Jesus to Petros, lacobos and Ioann~s, at the time of the transfiguration. Ainmonius insisted that all which Christ had in view by coming into the world, was to reinstate and restore to its primitive integrity, the wisdom of the ancients. This Di - vine Wisdom had been first brought to Light, he insisted, and nurtured among the people of the Orient by Hermes Trisln3gistos, Zoroaster, and other great and sacred char - acters; and had been warmly espoused and cherished by Pythagoras and Plato.. Therefore he desired to reconcile all the different philosophical sects, produce a harmony of all relhrions, and prevail on all the wise and good men to lay aside their contentions and quarrels, and unite together as the children of one common mother. The Divine Wisdom was everywhere personified. It was not an attribute, but a Person, and as it were, a God. It Was Khakemah, the second Sephirah of the Kabalah, whose name we meet with in the 32d degree. “By Wisdom,” say the Proverbs, “God founded the Earth; by Understanding lie established the Heavens.” This Divine Wisdom is not an Emanation that once and no more, to create, flowed forth from the Unknown Father. It is immanent in Him, but manifests itself limitedly in the Universe and man as the WORD, which continually ema - nates from Him, and is the Shekinah, that utters its Oracles from the Mercy-Seat in the Sanctuary. Within the Soul of the Seer and the Sage, it is still the Divine Wisdom, the Inspiration of the Deity. Thus God dwells in the human Soul, and the Divine intermingles with the Human, and God is near at hand with His creatures, not afar off and inac - cessible, but embracing all with His infinitude of love. The Wise and G6od of no age and no religion have been aliens from God and the kingdom of Heaven. And there - fore the Secret Doctrine ever-ywhere taught that the soul could by heroic effort, patient endurance, and the practice of the virtues, be enlightened and invigorated, and made to resemble God, whose image it is, so as at last to unite again with Him of whom it is an Emanation. We are the"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"130 T~rY-SECOND DEGREE. Sons of God, as we are the Sons of Men; and Jesus promised his disciples that they should be one with the Father, even as he himself was. This is the ‘Light,’ in search of which a Mason journeys, ‘from the high place of Gabaon, to the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.’ To this end he is taught to prac - tice the principal virtues, by which the body is kept pure and the spirit strengthened and enlightened, and to climb the three, five and seven steps that ascend toward the skies. The Manich~ans believed that their founder, Manes or Mani, was a Masayah, or an Incarnation of the Divine Wis - dom. The black and white tesser~e of the Masonic pave - ment, the black and white Beauseant, and the black and white hilt of the Kadosh dagger, all allude to the ancient doctrine of the Dualism of the manifestedi Deity, as Creator and Destroyer. Creation is ever effected, in every depart - ment of the Universe, by means of Destruction, or rather Dissolution. Creation is but re-combination; destruction, only solution, renovation, new formation. This, as well as the Immortality of the Soul, the resurrection of Rhur-Om teaches; and each of his slayers is not only ‘~fl’ but ~ So, in other respects, there is equilibrium in the Universe, whence alone can flow Succession, which is Continuance. God sends his golden mercies to us, preceded by iron adver - sities. By means of the tests and arduous dangers of Ini - tiation we attain Perfection.

Day and Night, Light and Shadow, incessantly follow each other round the Earth, as Creation or Production, and Dissolution, Life and Death alternate eternally, and revolve in the same"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL SECRET. 131 eternal circle. Annihilation is a word without a meaning. We cannot conceive that something can cease to be, and become nothing. If we could, we could conceive that God also might cease to exist. Above all, then, in all the ancient philosophies and re - ligio ns, was the Incomprehensible, Indefinable, Nameless Deity, whom some of the Gnostics even called Buthos and ~LJ///, the Abyss and Silence; whose Eternity is said by Saint Augustine not to be endless Time, Time without be - ginning or end; and whose Infinity is said to have no rela - tion to space; of whom, it is said, nothing, not even Exist - ence can be predicated. Yet was this Unknown Father, Ainsoph, never unmani - fested, never inactive, never uncreating. Always He deter - mined and limited rnmself as active generative energy, and passive productive capacity, or in the figurative language of the old philosophies, as Male and Female. So manifested, or rather self-determined, He was Brahm-Maya and ~ The result was the Divine Idea of the Universe, and the Creative Agent or D~miourgos, the Logos, the Divine Wis - dom uttering itself, developing in form, in time and space the Divine Idea. But the work of Creation is no~ a single act, instantane - ~usly done and ended, a single flash, as it were, of the Divine Will. The Infinite Thought is continuously uttered. The work of Creation never pauses; and the D~miourgos is Creator, Continuer or Preserver, and Destroyer; three, and yet one, Brahma, Vishnu and ~ 5 ’iva. The wiser Greek Phi - losophy taught that there was still another Trinity, the Father, the Logos, Wisdom, or Son, and the Holy Spirit, 1Io~i3x6, Psi1ch~ or PsycM, ‘breath, life, spirit,’ or the Divine Love, the moving cause of the creation and preservation of the Universe. The ancient philosophical ideas were not absurdities or subtilties. We can no more know the Deity than the Soul, directly, but only by His works. We know the Soul only by the words and acts that express its thoughts. It may even be said that even thus we know only its thoughts and"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"132 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. not itself. Do we, then, know the Deity by His works? Only upon the tacit assumption that the Deity is a Spirit, like our Soul, and acting and producing effects as the Soul does. But we are not entitled to assume that. It is true, that if we do not, we can have absolutely no idea of the Deity. But, notwithstanding that consequence, it remains true, that we have no right to predicate any faculty, power or passion of the Deity, because it belongs to us. We have no right and no reason, to say that the Deity possesses intelligence, or that He thinks. For Intelligence is a finite faculty given by Him to the creature; and it is the finite human Soul that thinks. With the same right we might say that He sees, or that He possesses Reason or imagina - tion or fancy, or any other merely human attribute. We have surely no right to predicate sex of Him, to say that HE is Male. We cannot even predicate Existence of the Absolute Deity. We can only say that He Is, not fhat He exists. Greated things exist or live. The Deity Is. We cannot, therefore, argue that the Deity is intelligent, because we see everywhere in the creation that which we call, in the works of man, design. We cannot know God Himself by the Universe. That is to say, we cannot with certainty know that the cause of given effects in the Divine nature is the same as the cause of like effects would be in Human nature. Else we would be warranted in assigning to His anger, jealousy, fickleness, revenge, whatsoever, done by men, would be evidently the fruit of those passions. God maq be what His works, to our human comprehen - sion, prove Him to be; but we cannot say that He is so. He is, therefore, utterly concealed from us, and we can predi - cate nothing whatever of Him, except that He Is. We cannot say that He is really without intelligence, without emotions, an abyss, silence; but only that we cannot know that He is any more. But, assuming that He thinks, the Creative Thought, which is the Will and the Act, is but a single one among a possible inftite number. No one thought can disclose to us the whole of a Human Soul. Surely no one Divine Thought can"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL SECRET. 133 disclose to us the whole Deity. Still, not part of Soul thinks that Thought, but the whole Soul. It is the Deity that thinks; but we know only the Thought, and so much of the Deity as the one Thought among an infinitude unknown to us reveals. We can know Him only as Creator of so much of the Universe as is known to us. The Universe is finite. The idea of it formed by the Deity is also necessarily finite. A finite thought or idea cannot reveal to us an infinite Deity. Therefore we can only know Him as self-limited to think, as the Logos or Dt~miourgos. We know the Creative Wisdom, the Word, not the Very Deity. We see the electric spark, but it does not reveal to us the great electric sea. Knowing nothing of the nature of the Deity, we cannot know that He does not assume a dis - tinct individuality by self-limitation; that the Logos is not a Person, an Emanation, a ray of the Infinite Ocean of Light. We are even utterly ignorant of the nature of our own SouL How can we know the Infinite God? We can only know so much of Him as He chooses to reveal to us. Perhaps all electricity is one, a single Agent of God, co-extensive with the Universe; and yet the single bolt or flash of lightning may have its individuality, for the limited purposes of its present action. We know God as Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer. We know Him as the Logos or Wisdom, and this, to us, is necessarily the Deity. We know the D~miour - gos as the Grand Architect pf the Universe. What is a Thought? Is it an Entity, an Existence, or is it the Soul thinking? What is the Will, as a Unit in Action? is it not the Soul willing this or that? The Thought and the Will are the Soul, then; yet neither is the whole or Very Soul; but only the Soul limited and manifested as the Thought, which, uttered, is the Wprd, that slays or saves, orders or forbids. After all, what is the Electricity, of which itself we know nothing, and whose effects and manifestations alone we know? Are we entitled to say with positiveness that it is a sabstance or a force which God has created, and which, having created, He uses; and that it is not God Himself"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"134 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. manifested as Electricity, and acting? Is it not possible for Omnipotence to be the particular and limited force which It exerts? Cannot the Omnipotent and the Infinite limit Him - self to act, and be the Creative Wisdom or Logos? It was the Alohim, the Pozuei~ of the Deity, many, andi yet one in will aud act, that created the world; and yet, according to the same Hebrew books it was Yehueh-Alohim, the source from which the Alohiin emanated, that of which they are the powers, that did the same. It does not need the act of an In/unite Will or Wisdom or Power to produce a finite effect; and God must, as it were, make Himself finite and limited, to be in the least comprehended or conceived of by a finite Intellect. With an Infinite God only, the Universe would be, as it were, wit hoid a God. Evermore, the. Very Deity must remain hidden in the profundity of His Mysterious Being and Essence, Nameless, Inaccessible, Unknown, beyond the reach of the Human Intellect; not materially remote in some far-off depth of the Universe; because wherever we are, HE is; but inaccessible to us, in the depths of His Mys - terious Being. We can have cognizance only of the Deity manifested by self-limitation. Surely it is possible for Omnipotence so to limit or even divide itself, as even to consort with humanity and see that a sparrow fall not to the ground ~innecessarily and uselessly. Man must have his household Gods; and it is Christ aiid the Virgin Mary whom the mass of Catholics worship, as other sects adore Jesus alone and not the Father. Even the Holy Ghost, which is but a name and a myth to the multitude, is worshiped, upon some vague notion that it is possessed of human sympathies. The God of the He - brews dwelt in the little cubical Holy of Holies of the Tem - ple, on the Mercy-Seat, between the winged bulls called Ka - robim, and was there styled ~1 9~ DV~ Dens co-habitczns, God residing or dwelling with his people, as one pitches his tent among his neighbors. Between the Infinite, Absolute, Inaccessible, Unknown Deity and the finite Human Soul, there can be no connection Df sympathy. How can man claim to have any tie or sym -"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"THE ROYAL SECRET. 1~5 pathy with that Infinite to which he can assign no human passion or emotion, nor even a Reason or Intelligence or Motives analogous to those of the human Soul? Between this Infinite Inaccessible and man there needs a Mediator, that can transmit the human sympathies to the Divinity, and the Divine sympathies with man to Humanity; and God manifests and reveals Himself to us as such Mediator. Appreciate this idea as we may, it has from the earliest times and universally been accepted by the human race. In the Hermetic Theology, EMEPH, as we learn from lam - bhichus, was reputed to be the chief of all the Celestial Gods, an Intelligence object of its own thought. But before Emeph was another Intellect denominated EICToN, the first of beings,. and to be worshiped only in the silence of deep abstraction. To these two a third was added, who was specially the Creator of the World, and bore the names of Phtha and Am~n. The latter name, means in the Hebrew, ‘Workman,’ Artfficer, and in Prov. viii. 30, Wisdom is called Amin, the Artificer of the world. It means, also ‘Faith, Faithful and Truth.’ The adjuration ascribed by Cyril and Justin Martyr to Orpheus, •and by John Malela andi the Paschal Chronicle to Hermes, may be corrupted ; but it certainly reproduces the ancient doctrine: “I adjure thee, the Voice of the Father, which He first spc4~e when He established the Universe by His Wis - dom; the Voice qf the Father which He first uttered, His only- begotten Word!” So the Oracle replied to an early Egyptian king, .who inquired who the Being was that ruled all things: “First, God; then the Word; and the Spirit with them. All these coalesce together, and proceed ,jointly into that unity, whose Strength is the strength of Ages.” “We know,” says George Stanley Faber, Rector of Long- Newton, in his work on Pagan Idolatry, dedicated to the Lord Bishop of Durham, “from innumerable passages of Holy Writ that JEHOVAH the Messenger” ~ “through whom alone communication has been kept up, between the .worm man and Jehovah the Father, when - ever He deigned to converse with His creatures, manifested"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"136 ~~-S~COND DEGREE. Himself in a human form. Moses says that Adam and Eve ‘heard the Voice of the Lord God’ [~ ~ Kol - JHUH ALHIM], ‘as he walked in the garden.’ Maimo - nides says, and Mr. Faber agrees, that it was the Voice or Word that walked. Whether this is correct or not, it is cer - tain that the Word of Jehovah [~fl~i’ ~ Debar-IHUH] means the Oracle and Messenger of Jehovah; by it the an - cient Israelites understood the Great Messenger of the Cove - nant, said by Malachi to be Lord of the Temple at Jeru - salem. The Debar-Ihuh came unto Abram in a vision, and he addressed it as Adonal-IHUR. Hengstenberg Fon the genuineness of Daniel], says “that the doctrine of the Angel or Revealer of God, runs through the whole of the old. Testament; who, in a two-fold respect, first, as the highest of all Angels, then as connected with the Hidden God by a oneness of essence, appears as His REVEALER.” And. in ~xod. xxxii. 34, another Angel is associated, standing in the same relation to him as he to the Most High God. In the Bresohit Babbcth we read, ‘Uticunque loco rum Michael visus fuif, u.n est gloria ~ps~us Skekince.’ In the Solzar, ‘in omrn loco quo invenies Iifichaelern, qui est capiet An~elorum, ibi e3t Slzekinu.’ ‘Wherever Michael the Archangel is, there is the Shekinab, the actual presence or revealment of God.’ This is the DEBAR-IHUH, the WORD of IHUH, which came to Abram and conversed with him, and brought him forth out - side of his tent, and showed him the stars and said, ‘I am IHUH, who brought thee out of Aur Kasdim;’ and whom Abram called Adona~-IRuH. This is the Malak-Ihuh that met Hagar in the Wilaerness, and whom she called a God revealed unto her; the SEM - Imrn, the NAME of IHUH [Gcn. xvi. 131, which dwelt in the Temple in ~he House built to the Name of God, ~ ~ 11fl’I Bit/i l’Sem-IHUH [1 Kings, iii. 2], the House of the Name of God. ~V ‘?V ~ ihih semi sem; there, [in the Temple] my Name will dwell [1 Kings, viii. 29; 2 Kings, xxiii. 27].

Again Alohim appeared to him [Gem xxxv. 9], and said to him, ‘I am ~y ~, AL Sm,’ and blessed him, ‘and ascended from him in the place where he had spoken with him.’ And Jacob called the place where Sem-Alohim (the Name of Alohim) spoke with him, Bith-Al. The finite human Intellect can know nothing and conceive nothing in respect to the Infinite and Absolute. The mo - ment it attempts to conceive of it, it involves itself in a thousand absurdities. And it has in reality no conception whatever of the Deity, except as a human soul, mind, and intellect, incleftuitely vast, with a human will of indefinite efficacy and. power, a human wisdom immense in. fts pro - portions, and the best characteristics of the human moral nature, in4efinitely perfect. By this conception only, we attempt ~o explain to ourselves the Mysteries of Deity and the Universe. Man can have no other God than a God in. his own image. The Infinite must limit itself to come within. the grasp of the finite human thought. When God desired to annou~nce to Abraham what He int~n~ed to do for him and. for his posterity, and what pun - ishment to inflict on perverse and criminal peoples, three human individu t3 came to make these communications to the Patriarch, who had no misgivings as to the dignity of the Intelligences that animated these human aggregates..

We readl in the Rituals of this Degree, that Frederic the Secondl, or the Great, King of Prussia, being at the head of the Masonic Fraternity on the Continent of Europe, pro - jected a league of union of the Brethren, Companions, Knights, Princes and Commanders of Masonry, for the pur - pose of rescuing Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre from the hands of the Turks, by a new Crusade, in which it was his intention to command in person. It is said that he prepared a plan by which the army was to encamp; which is the same now presented to you, and which is also perpetuated on the Tracing-Board and Apron of this Degree. All that is mere nonsense. The whole is a Symbol. It must originally have had a meaning. For it cannot be sup - posed that a man of intellect ever seriously occupied him - self with making a beautiful figure on paper, arranging it as a camp, and adopting arbitrary lotters and names, without any deeper meaning than that which you havc thus far discovered. It is an elaborate, complicated and intricate symbol. Its meaning was no doubt originally explained only orally; and that alone would be cause sufficient why the meaning should in time be lost. The same cause has lost Masonry the true meaning of many even of its simpler symbols, and substituted strained, unnatural and common - place interpretations in their places. The figure is a St. Andrew’s Cross inclosed by a Circle; that by a Triangle, that by a Pentagon, that by a Heptagon, and that by a Nonagon. On the lines of the Nonagon are the camps of the Masons of the first eighteen Degrees; on those of the Pentagon, the camps of those from the nine-"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC C~P. 143 teenth to the thirtieth, inclusive; on the Triangle, those of the thirty-first andi thirty-second Degrees. It is evident that the distribution of these Degrees is now merely arbitrary. While eighteen Degrees occupy the Nona - gon, being double the number of its sides, twelve occupy the Pentagon, and two the Triangle. It is true that Knights of Malta are added, to make three Bodies for the Triangle ; but this is evidently a mere make-shift; for they are not Masons, and to introduce them destroys the whole idea at once. The seventeen sides of these three figures in no way suit the present number of the Degrees. Then, again, there are no camps at all on the Heptagon, andl so it becomes a perfectly useless part of the figure. The discrepancies in the Rituals as to the distribution of the first eighteen Degrees, show that the arrangement is arbitrary; and there is no attempt made to connect the letters of the camp or of the standards in any way with the Degrees to which they are assigned. They would seem to have been taken at random, like the names of the Com - manding Officers, which offer the most singular and incon - gruous mixture. As if further to increase the difficulty, the Rituals differ as to the Standardis to which the respective letters T.. E.. N.~. G.. U.•. are to be assigned. The devices of these Standards are not apparently connected with the Degrees in either arrangement; nor is any attempt made to explain their meaning, or show whence part of them have come. Then we are told of three Birds, one in each corner of the Triangle, a Raven, a Dove and a Phcenix. No one tells us whence they come, or whence the Palm-trees on each side of the Ark; or the meaning of the inflamed and winged Heart; or that of the Cros~ in the Circle. And if any attempt to explain these things has been made, it is painful to a man of intellect to read the mise - rable and trivial stuff to which sensible men are expected respectfully to listen. The reason for selecting the several geometrical figures is obvious.

There are hints enough scattered here and there in the writings of the Hermetics andl Alchemists, to make it quite certain that the true meanings of the symbols used by Py - thagoras, and the doctrines of Zarathustra, had, at least in part, been preservedi, and were possessed by a few of the Adepts, by whom they were jealously guarded, and only obscurely and as it were incidentally alluded to. The Zend writings were unknown when part of the Symbols were introduced into Freemasoary, and the Zarathustrian ‘Holy Doctrine’ had long been totally lost even among the Parsees. The 47th Problem of Euclid was one of these Symbols; and it was placedl among the Symbols of the Lodge without any explanation at all. The Master of the Royal Secret knows its real meaning. The theorem is that the sum of the squares of the base and perpendicular of every right - an~led triangle is equal to the square of the hypothenuse; but the significance of the symbol to the Adept consists in this, united with the fact that the base, perpendicular and hypothenuse are represented by the numbers 3, 4, 5. Now, the ‘Aonagon of the Camp is 9, and this is the square of 3, numb’~ of the base of the Triangle. The Heptagon of the Camp is 7, and this is the number of the Am’ sha-§~p:.ntas, and of the base and perpendicular, 3~-4=7. The Nonagon and Heptagon are 9 -i- 7 = 16, and this is the square of 4, the number of the perpendicular of the Triangle. And 9, the square of 3, number of the base, added to 16, the square of 4, number of the perpendicular, make 25, the number of the Degrees of the Bite of Perfection, and the square of 5, number of the hypothenuse. The Pentagon is 5, i. e., 1 + 4, the number of the hypothe - nuse. What 3 + 4 = ‘7 represent, and what 1 + 4= 5, and 3 x 3 = 9, the Adept knows. The Triangle is 3, the number of the base of the Triangle; and this, as the Adept knows, is also 3 x 3. The Circle represents the Deity, as infinite, because every"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC CAMP. 145 point in itis at an equal distance from the centre, and it is infinitely divisible. The Cross, like cver~V other Cross, represents 5, i. e. the central point, 1, the Unit, the Deity, and the arms radiating from it, 4. It reproduces the number 5 of the hypothe - nuse, and the One containing in Himself Four. The first eighteen Degrees were the same in the Rite of Perfection as they now are, one transposition only excepted. Of the higher Degrees, our 19th and 20th were then included in a single one, the 19th; our 21st was the 20th; our 22d was then the 2 2 dl; our 28th was then the 2 3d1; our 30th, or a Degree like it, was then the 24th; our 3 2d1 was then the 25th, and there were no Degrees above that; and our 23d, 24th, 25th and 26th, as well as the 334, were not then known. The 27th was a detachedi Degree, audI the 29th was part of another system. The Regulations and Constitutions said to have been made at Bordeaux, by the Princes of the Royal Secret, in 1762, give the list of these Degrees andi require 81 months— 9 x 9—by 1, 3, 5 and 7, to be occupiedi in obtaining them. They are divided into seven classes, of 3, 5, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, Degrees respectively, the time requiredl for obtaining the Degrees in each class, respectively, being 15 or 3 5, 21 or 3 x 7, 7, 5, 9, 9, and 15 or 3 x 5, months. The Regulations term these the mysterious numbers, and there is in. Article II. a curious paragraph in regard to them, which we translate: “All these Degrees, into which one must be initiated in a mysterious number of months, to arrive in succession at each Degree, form the number of Si months. 8+1 make 9, as 8 and 1 express 81, and as 9 times 9 make 81; all of which are perfect numbers, and very different from 1 and 8, which make 9, as 1 and 8 compose 18, and. as 2 x 9 make 18; for these are imperfect numbers, and this combination is imperfect; but a true Mason who has completed his time, gathers at kzst the ]Piasonic Rose.” 81 is the square of 9, which is the square of 3. Itis also the number of the base; 108 is the number of the perpen - I0"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"146 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. dicular, and 135 the number of the hypothenuse. That is, they are 27 x 3: 27 x 4: 27 x 5. And, adding the figures of each number together as they stand, 108, i. e. 1 ± 8 = 9; and 133, i. e. 1 ± 3 + 5 9; as 81, i. e. 8 + 1 = 9. So, the square of 81 is 6,561, which as 6 + 5 6 + 1 is 18, which as 1 •4- 8 = 9. The square of 108 is 11,664; which as 1+1±6+6+4 is iS, which as 1+8=9. And the square of 135 is 18,225, which as 1 ± 8 + 2 ± 2 + 5 is 18, which as 1 + 8 is 9. And 6,561 + 11,664 is 18,225, the square of the hypothenuse. As the numbers of the different figures in the Camp added together make 25, the correspondence of this with the nu.m - ber of the Degrees of the Bite of Perfection at once suggests the probability that originally the different Degrees were distributed among the different figures, to each according to its number; and that, in some way, perhaps by a re - arrangement upon the increase of the number of the Degrees, a new distribution took place, assigning the letters to new places, and one letter to more than one Degree, displacing the standards, and causing the disuse of the Heptagon. - Nothing that throws any light on the symbol has come down to us by tradition. We are left to our own conjectures, aided only by the few hints we shall mention; and it is quite doubtful whether the whole meaning of the TTacing-Board will ever be discovered. The words formed bythe letters, the names of the Commanding Officers of the Nonagon and Pen - tagon, and the watchwords and answers, seem entirely arbi - trary, and their symbolic meaning wholly inexplicable. Resorting first to conjecture, and assuming as a reason - able supposition, that the lower Degrees were originally assigned, as they now are, to the lines of the camp farthest from the centre, because that is natural, and because the general idea would, in all probability, not be departed from in the re-arrangement which the increased number of De - grees made necessary, we. at once, find that the Nonagon, offering us nine sides, accommodates the first imine Degrees, beginning with the Apprentice and endi~g with the Elect of Nine; and that the Heptagon, completing with its seven"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC CAMP. 147 sides the number 16, accommodates those from the tenth to the sixteenth, or Prince of Jerusalem, inclusive; and thus, as the Regulations do, puts these Princes at the head of the Masons of those sixteen Degrees. And this agrees with the Regulations of 1762, which declare them to be “the most valiant Chiefs of the Renovated Masonry,” and give them control over all Lodges of the Royal Perfection and Councils of Knights of the East. Above these sixteen Degrees, then, by the system of 1762, are the following, which we number as they stand in both scales: 17. Knight of the East and West 17, 18. Sovereign Prince Rose Croix 18, 19. Grand Pontiff and Master ad vitam .... 19 and 20, 20. Grand Patriarch Noachite 21, 21. Grand Master of the Key of Masonry 22. Prince of Libanus or Knight Royal Axe 22, 23. Sovereign Prince Adept, or Knight of the Sun.. 28, 24. Grand Commander of the Black Eagle 30, 25. Sovereign Prince of the Royal Secret 32. Now, it is obvious that the five sides of the Pentagon ac - commodate the five degrees from 17 to 21 inclusive; and if we assign the Princes of the Royal Secret to the Circle, as we must do to make the numbers correspond, we have for the Triangle, 22. Prince of Libanus or Knight Royal Axe, 23. Sovereign Prince Adept, or Knight of the Sun, 24. Grand Commander of the Black Eagle. To have placed an inferior Degree on the Triangle and one of these three on the Pentagon, and thus farther from the centre 4 would have been to disarrange and interrupt the regular order and succession of the Degrees, from circum - ference to centre; and this we do not think the inventors of the symbol would have done, even if it required a little forezng to make the emblems correspond; N’cause one I"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"148 THigiY-sECOND DEGREE. irregularity, of thcd kind, would have destroyed the harmony and symmetry of the whole system and the idea on which it was framed. Now, to the Triangle three BUds are assigned, apparently, in the present system, without any meaning. The RAVEN may be the BLACK EAGLE of the 24th Degree, that is, the Kaclosh, or Knight of the White and Black Eagle, of which Degree the old Jewel was a Black Eagle. The DOVE was a sacred bird in Syria, and the only one employed for religious purposes among the Hebrews. One was, according to the legend, sent out three several times, with intervals of seven days between each mission, by Noah from the Ark, as well as by Deucalion; and z ~ 0 & is the first Pass-word of the 22d Degiee or Prince of Libanus. Connected with LIGHT, the SuN and KHn~t~, is that alle - gorical bird, the PHENIX. Like other symbols, it was in - vented to conceal; and its meaning, like that of other sym - bols, is, of course, not palpable nor obvious. Herodotus represents the people of Heiiopolis (the city of the SUN,) as saying that this bird only visits their country once in.500 years, on the death of its father; when it comes from Arabia, bringing with it its father’s body, enveloped in myrrh, which it buries in the Temple of the Sun. According to Herodotus and Pliny, it resembles in size and general appearance an Eagle; of a gold color about the neck, its wings part gold, part red, the rest of the body pur.. ple, and the tail blue. • In Arabia, it is sacred to the Sun; it lives six hundred years, and then builds a nest with twigs of ca&sia and frank - incense, fills it with aromatics, and dies upon it. A worm is produced from its bones and marrow, which becomes a young bird, carries the nest to the city of the Sun, near Panch~a, and there deposits it on the altar. Manilius says that the Great Year agrees with the life of this bird, in which the seasons and stars return to their first places, be - ginning at noon on the day when the Sun enters Aries. The Egyptian Phc2nix is represented under the form of a bird, -its wings partly raised. s’~ated on its open claws, and"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC CAMP. 149 raising in frant two human arms, side by side, palms to the front, and at the height of the forehead or top of the head, in an atti - tude of supplication. Sometimes the Phcenix is represented under the form of a man, with wings, in the same supplica - tory attitude, with a tuft of feathers on top of the head, and ~ the arms a five-pointed star. Ovid says the Ass yric’ns call the bird Phcenix; the same word in Greek [PoZvz~] means also a palm-tree, and the pur - ple color. So Khirflm was a Phcenician [~boivu~og. Different writers give differently the number of years for the periodical return of the Phcenix; fixing it variously at 500, 660, 600, 340, 1460, or 1461. The last is the Sothic period; and this was, no doubt, the real Phcenix of Egypt. It was the Great Year of the Egyptians, at the end of which all the planets returned to the same places they occupied at its commencement. The Egyptian civil Solar year consisted of 365 days. But the tr2e year, called the Sothic, because calculated from the heliacal rising of Sothis in one year, to the same event in the next, was nearly 365k days. Accordingly, a day was inter - calated every fourth year, and the Solar year lost, every four years, a day of the Sothic year; so that the 1st of Thoth ran through every part of the Solar year, in the space of 1460 Sothic years, before it again coincided with the 1st of Thoth of the Sothic year. The Phcenix figured in Alchemy, which purported to be a search after the Elixir that was to give immortality. Of course it was peculiarly appropriate to the 23d Degree, now the 28th, of Knight of the Sun or Prince Adept, a Hermetic and Alchemical degree. The black RAVEN probably represented Aiira-Mainyus (Ahriman), the negation or absence of Light and Good, the Principle of Evil, antagonist of §~p~nta-IMainyu, the white and beneficent Mind, or Divine Wisdom~ inunanent in the Deity, symbolized by the white Dovx, in the sape whereof, ages after Zarathustra lived, the Holy Ghost descended upon Jesus, the Christos. And the Phcenix represented Ahura Mazda, the Creator,"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"150 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. Splendor and Light-Essence, in whom was the Divine Wis - dom which uttered itself in Humanity as the Word. To each angle and side of the Pentagon, as we have seen, is assigned a SLandard, designated by a letter and a particu - lar device.

The Crowned Double-headed EAGLE is thus left for the 20th Degree, Noachite or Prussian Knight. But the double. - headed Eagle is not Prussian. The Emperors of the Western Roman Empire used a black Eagle; those of the East a golden one. The two-headed Eagle signifies a double Empire. The Emperors of Austria, who claim to be considered the suc - cessors of the Roman C~sars, use the double-headed Eagle, which is the Eagle of the Eastern Emperors with that of the Western, typifying the Holy Roman Empire, of which the Emperors of Germany (merged in the House of Austria) eonsidered themselves the representatives. Charlemagne"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC CAMP. 151 was the first to use it; for when he became master of the whole of the German Empire, he added the second head to the Eagle, in the year 802, to denote that the Empires of Rome and Germany were united in him. The Ancient Persian mysteries were sacred to the God MITHRA, Deo Soli In’victo Afitkrce; to the Sun-God IVIITHRA, the INVINCIBLE, also called the Mediator, the slaver of the Dragon and Evil Spirits. He was worshiped among the Ethiopians and Egyptians, in Greece, and, after the time of Pompey, at Rome. He is represented in the sculptures as a young man mounted on the equinoctial B~e 11, and plunging into its flank a sword, whose hilt terminates at the upper end in two heads of an Eagle or a Hawk. He is represented as at the mouth of a cavern, with a figure on each side bear - ing a lighted Torch. He is accompanied by Eorosch, the celestial Raven; and the dying Bull is consoled by a Star, supposed to be Tistrya, the harbinger of his resurrection. The Buu~ was regarded as the symbol of the power that produces Vegetation and Life. “He makes,” the Zenda - vesta said, “the grass to grow abundantly, and gives all fruitfulness to the Earth.” Hence the motto of the Stan - dard on which he figures: Omnia Tempus alit. So in Egypt, MNEvIS, the Black Ox of Heliopolis, was dedicated to Osnus, and worshiped; and ~E1ian says that the Egyptians wor - shiped a Black Bull, which they called O~urrns. The LION, the sign of the summer solstice, and domicil of the Sun, was the symbol of that orb. He figures in the Mithriac monuments; and the second Degree of the Persian Mysteries was called the Degree of the Lion. The Initiates were called Eagles, Hawks and Ravens. In a very curious Roman marble, the drawing of which was published by Gronovius, in his Latin edition of Agostii, representing Mithra with one foot on the body and the other between the horns of a Bull, are seen a Lion’s Head and two Palm-trees, just putting out their leaves, a RAvEN, and an EAGLE on a Palm-tree, holding a thunder-bolt in his claws. It is this thunder-bolt which is among our symbols represented by a sword, with a crooked or wavy blade."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"152 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. Mithra himself was often represented with the head of a Lion. The Palm-tree was not only an emblem of Virtue and Truth, but it was also consecrated to the celestial move - ments, and above all to the annual revolution of the Sun. The Raven [in Hebrew, ~ Arab, meaning also Black - ness, Darkness, the Evening, a noxiousfiy, any noxious ani - mal, Arabia, the woof of a web, and the willow (sAux), is an appropriate emblem of the Evil Principle, typified by Ta - phon and Aura Mainyus; as the white Dove [~~] is of the Good Principle, Light, typified by §p6nta Mainyu and Osiris. In this word IO~EH we perhaps have the anagram of NOM; and thus the first two words would mean the R~ - yen and the Dove, or the Good and Evil Principles of Zara - thustra, Manes and some of the Gnostic sects. In that case it would remain to connect the third word with these, either as expressing the beam of the balance that produces the equilibrium, or the resulting Harmony. The black raven and white dove, like the two sphinxes of the chariot of Osnus, and the two gods SERAPIS, one black, the other white, typify the two forces in the universe which maintain it in equilibrium, attraction and repulsion. These forces exist alike in the physical, moral and intellectual world; and their scientific reality is demonstrated by the phenomena of polarity and the universal law of sympathies and antipathies. The disciples of Zarathustra, misunder - standing the doctrine of their Master, divided the Deity into these two, Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, thus separating the two columns of the temple, and ignoring the number three, by which this dualism again becomes unity, as represented by the Triangle. The principle that so re - stores unity in the Ternary is the Phc2nix of the Tracing- Board of this Degree. The Phc.enix of this Degree, and the Pelican of the Bose ~roix, were the symbols, with the Alchemists, of” THE GlIXAT WORK.” Again, of the colors, BLACK was, with the Alchemists, the symbol of the Earth; WHITH of the Water; and RED of the"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC CAMr. 1;,d Fire, “wherein, also,” says “The True Mason,’~ 23d Degree, or 12th of the 5th class, “are involved very great Secrets and Mysteries.” Fire, again, is Sulphur; Water, Mercury; and the Earth, Salt. These three PRD~CIPLES, represented by the Triangle, result from the mixture of the four ele - ments, Fire, Water, Aw, aLd Earth, which are represented by the CRoss. From the three Principles, says the same ritual, result the four Elements duplicated, or the Grand Elements, Akr - cury, Sulphur, Salt and Glass or AZOTH, also represented by the CRoss. Black, again, is putrefaction; and White, sublimation; by the latter of which the ‘Great Work’is effected; and Scar - let, in part the color of the Phcenix, represents the Philo - sophal Stone. Morally, in Alchemy, the three colors, black, -white and red, represent the three principal virtues; while the Cross is the symbol of Light; and the Sun, represented by the Phcenix, is the symbol of gold. “SALT,” says Ragon, “is the attribute of the Father; SUL - PHUR, of the Son; and MERCURY, of the Holy Spirit. From the action of these three results the Triangle in the Square [the three Principles in the four Elements], and from the seven angles of these, the Decade [10], a perfect number ;“ represented by the nine sides of the Nonagon, and the point in the centre. Ten, ii is said, is the perfect number. It is the number of the Sephiroth. It includes both the unity of God, by whom everything was created, and the chaos from which all outgoings have proceeded. “He who shall be so fortu.. nate as to know what the number ten is in formal arith - metic, and to comprehend the nature of the first spherical number, which is the number 10, shall know,” says Pic de la Mirandola, “the secret of the fifty gates of the understand - ing, and that of the grand 1 jubilee of the lOOOth generation, and the reign of all the ages, which the Kabalists called ~nsoph; and the Divinity itself shall stand revealed to him.” “It is the duty of the Tiler,” says the IRitu~l of the K~ -"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"154 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. balistic Bose Croix, “to see if the Chapter is hermetically sealed; whether the materials are ready, and the elements; whether the black gives place to the white, and the white to the red.” “When matter is deemed to be dead to the world,” says the same, “it must be revivified, and made to be born, again from its ashes; which you will effect by virtue of the vegetation of the Tree of Life represented to us by the branch of cassia. Whoever shall learn to comprehend and execute this great work will know great things, say the Sages of the Work; but whenever you depart from the centre of the Square and Compasses you will no longer be able to work with suc - ce~s.” [The Square and Compasses form, on the Masonic Altar, the interlaced triangles, or Seal of Solomon, repre - senting the visible and invisible worlds.] “A great black Eagle, the king of birds. He alone it is that can fix the Sun, material in its nature, that has no form, and yet by its form develops color. The Black is a complete harbinger of the work; it changes color and assumes a natu - ral form, out whereof will emerge a brilliant Sun.” The phiosophal Mercury, says ‘le Vrai Ma9on,’ is a water and spirit which dissolves and sublimates the Sun. The phiosophal Sulphur is a fire and a Sotd, which m..lli - fies and colors it. The phiosophal Salt is an earth and a body, which coagu - lates and fixes it; and the whole is done in the bosom of the Air. Thus the Triangle, representing the three principles, and the Spirit, Soul, and Body, which together constitute Man, is again connected with the words dissolve and coagulate, or separate and unite. With the three principal substances, we may effect the transmutation of metals, says the Kabalistic Rose Croix, by means of the five points of Scottish Mastership. The first point is to extract the Salt, from rain-water, and then to submit it to a seven-fold purification, which is sym - bolized by the seven st~ps of Solomon’s Temple. The second point is to extract Sulphur from the purest"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIC CAMP. 155 gold, and acid to it the purified or celestial AS nit. The mix - ture is to remain a hundred and fifty clays, to putrefy. This point is symbolized by the Ark of Noah. The third point is to multiply the substance thus obtained by adding the animate volatile spirit. This point is sym - bolized by the Tower of Babel, the connection of Phaleg wherewith is well known to us as Masons. The fifth point is indicated by the Blazing Star. The work is now to be subjected to the fourth and strongest de - gree of fire, wherein it must remain three times 27 hours [the 81 months of the Degrees of the Rite of Perfection], until it is thoroughly glowing, by which means it becomes a bright and shining tincture, wherewith the lighter metals may be transmuted. This number, 27 x 3 or 81, reminds us of the mysterious number of months required by the Regulations of 1762 for conferring the~ degrees, and the whole passage shows the close connection of Hermeticism and Alchemy with Scottish Masonry. The Great Work is attained by solution and coagulation. These are embcctied in the s~pposed meanings of the two Pass-words, separated and united. These words, says ‘le Vrai M~’~on;’ mean that we must dissolve the body [the Black Raven], and coagulate the Spirit [the White Dove]. To aggregate and separate are the two verbs of Nature. One is effected by putrefaction; the other by sublimation. The Magical Man-Woman has written on the right arm, which is raised toward Heaven, SOLVE, and on the left, which is extended downward, COAGULA. Nature destroys at the same time that she regenerates. A Hermetic work, entitled ‘A Philosophical Epitaph,’ published at London in 1671, chiefly consisting of incompre - hensible jargon, contains the following phrases, the meaning of which is clear: ‘This Epitaph . . . illustrates all the Planets and their Mercury, and the Universal Spirit and Mercury of the World, and the Specificks of Nature; and no less, the true Mercury of Philosophers for this work . . . put naked, without garb,"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"156 THIC~Y-SECOND DEGREE. or any strange thing into its glass . . . till it come to the true Sulphur of philosophers. ‘Thus, it may appear double, you see, or one in two, Male and Female, superieur and inferieur, gross and subtil, cc.eles - tial and terrestrial, Sulphur and Mercury, water and earth, corruptible and incorruptible, or spiritual.

The radiant H~wr symbolized the Divine WISDOM, always identified with SPLENDOUR, (~‘p&nta - Mainyu, literally the White or radiant Intellect. The EAGLE with two heads symbolized Yohu-man~, the Divine Intellect manifested, revealed, and abiding, as the Intellect of Humanity, its two heads the Divine Intellect and the Human, which, in the doctrine of Zarathustra, were one. The Ox was the Symbol of Asha Vahista, the iDivine Strength or Power, manifested as all power and strength, and all Forces in the Universe and Man. And the LION symbolized Khshathra Yairya, the Divine Sovereignty, manifested and acting as all Rule, Power of Government and Heroic Sovereignty in Humanity. The figures 525 on the golden collar of the Lion present an enigma to which there is no key. 7 x 3=21, and 5 x 5 = 25, and 21 x 25 is 525. If we could discover the meaning of the three words of five letters each, it might prove the key to the meaning of the whole symbol. I have vainly endeavored for many years, to discover this meaning. I distinctly remember hav - ing seen it stated in some work that the willow (Lat. &dix), was the original device of the House of Brandenburg, whose Margravate finally.became the Kingdom of Prussia. But I have not since been able to find the statement anywhere, and if I could do so, the other words would remain as J.nex - plicable as before. There is no such letter as X in the Hebrew language, nor is either of the words Hebrew. Useless to look there for them. Salix and Nonis are Latin words, Nonis (abl. plur.) being the Nones of the months, the 5th or 7th day. But there is no Latin word like Tengu.

This is a statement of the doctrine of Zarathustra, which was the doctrine of Pythagoras, the Hermeticists, and the Alchemists, the doctrine expressed by the great Pythago - rean symbols possessed by Freemasonry. ARUBA was the Infinite Light, the Very God. The human intellect is the Divine Mind, as VOHU-MAN~, inspiring man; the Divine WORD. This was the doctrine of CIcERo, who in his De Ainicitid, 3, says: Neque assentior us qui h~ec nuper disserere cceperunt, cum corporibus simul animos interire atque omnia morte deleri.

The opinion of those an - cients weighs more with me, who held that the souls of men are divine, and that for these, when they go forth from the body, the way of return to the heaven is open, and that im - mediate, for every one who is most good and just.’ And, in the Tusculan Questions, v. 13, ‘Humanus autem"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"160 THIRTY-SECOND DEGREE. animus, decerptus ex mente divinA, cum alio nullo, nisi cum ipso Deo, si hoc fas est dictu, comparari potest;’ ‘But the human mind, severed from the Divine Intellect, can be com - pared with nothing else, if this is permissible to be said, than with God Himself.’ The Hermetic Philosophers had these sayings, which they uttered, and left them to explain themselves: Magisterium ex un~i radice procedit, in plures expanditur, in un~.un revertitur. ‘The Mastery issues from one root, is expanded into many, returns to the one.

These seven names are, curiously enough, those of three Persian Kings, Darius, Xerxes, and Cyrus; the Macedonian Conqueror, Alexander; Ptolemy-Philadelphus, one of his successors; Herod, the Tributary Roman King in Judt~a; anda Jewish King, Hezekiah; while all the Answers are the names of Jewish Prophets.
