When is a man a Mason? When he can look out over the rivers, the hills, and the far horizon with a profound sense of his own littleness in the vast scheme of things, and yet have faith, hope and courage. When he knows that down in his heart every man is as noble, as vile, as divine, as diabolic, and as lonely as himself, and seeks to know, to forgive, and to love his fellowman When he knows how to sympathize with men in their sorrows, yea, even in their sins—knowing that each man fights a hard fight against many odds. When he has learned how to make friends and to keep them, and above all how to keep friends with himself. When he loves flowers, can hunt the birds without a gun, and feels the thrill of an old forgotten joy when he hears the laugh of a little child When he can be happy and highminded amid the meaner drudgeries of life. When star-crowned trees, and the glint of sunlight on flowing waters, sub - due hun like the thought of one much loved and long dead When no voice of distress reaches his ears in vain, and no hand seeks his aid without response When he finds good in every faith that helps any man to lay hold of higher things, and to see majestic meanings in life, whatever the name of that faith may be When he can look into a wayside puddle and see some - thing besides mud, and into the face of the most forlorn mortal and see something beyond sin When he knows how to pray, how to love, how to hope When he has kept faith with himself, with his fellowman, with his God, in his hand a sword for evil, in his heart a bit of song—glad to live, but not afraid to die In such a man whether he be rich or poor, scholarly or unlearned famous or obscure, Masonry has wrought her sweet m in i 5 try—Joseph Fort Newton, “The Builders” Monitorial Work"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MONITORIAL OPENING AND CLOSING A LODGE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS In aii iegular assemblies of men who are convened for wise and useful purposes, the commencement and conclu - sion of business are accompanied with some foim In every country of the world the practice prevails, and Is deemed essential Prom the moat remote periods of an - tiquity it is traced, and the refined improvements of modern times have not abolished it CeremonIes, simply considered, are little more than visionary delusions, but their effccts are sometimes im - portant when they impress awe and reverence on the mind and attract the attention to solemn rites by exter - nal forms, they are interesting objects These purposes are effected when judicious ceremonies are regularly conducted and properly arranged On this ground they have received the sanction of the wisest men in all ages, and consequently could not escape the notice of Masons To begin weli is the most likely to end well, and it is justly remarked that where order and method are neg - lected at the beginning, they will seidom be found to take piace at the end The ceremony of opening and closing the Lodge with solemnity and decorum is thereiore universaily adopted among Masons, and though the mode in some meetings may vary, and in eveiy degree must vaiy, still uniform - ity in the general practice prevaiis in the lodges, and the variation, if any, is soieiy occasioned by a want of method, which a little application wiil easily remove To conduct this ceremony with propriety ought to be the peculiar study 01 every Mason, especiaiiy of those who have the honor to rule in Our assemblies To per - sons who are thus dignified every eye ii directed fe” regularity of conduct and behavior, and by their eA ample other Brethren less informed are naturally ex - pected to deriVe instruction Prom a share in this ceremony no Mason is exempted, it is a general concern in which all must assist This is the first request of the Master, and the prelude to business No sooner has it been signified than every of - ficer repairs to his station, and the biethren rank ac - cording to their degrees The intent of the meeting be - comes the object of attention, and the mind is insensibly drawn irom the indiscriminate subjects of conversation which are apt to intrude on our less serioui moments Our first care is directed to the external avenues of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 MON ITOHIAL the Lodge, and the proper officers wnose province it is to discharge that duty, execute the trust with fidelity By certain mystic forms, of no recent date, it is inti - mated that we may safely proceed To detect imposters among ourselves, an adherence to order in the character of Masons ensues, and the Lodge is opened or closed in solemn form At opening the Lodge, two purposes are effected The Master is reminded of the dignity of his character, and the Brethren of the homage and veneration due from them in their sundry stations These are not the only advantages resultfrig from a due observance of the ceremony, a reverential awe of the Deity is inculcated, and the eye fixed on that object from whose radiant beams light only can be derived Hence in this ceremony we are taught to adore God, and supplicate His pro - tection on our well-meant endeavors The Master as - sumes his government in due form, and under him his wardens, who accept their trust after the customary salutations.

Still the ‘I~ler heard his greeting, winter ice or summer rain. Father’s Lodge thought nothing of it; ‘mid their labors and their cares Those old Masons learned to love it, that frater - nity of theirs. What’s a bit of stormy weather, when a little down the road Men are gathering together, helping bear each other’s load? Father’s Lodge has made a village; men of fath - er’s sturdy brawn Turned a wilderness to tillage, seized the flag and carried on, Made a village, built a city, shaped a county, formed a state, Simple men, not wise nor witty—humble men, and yet how great! Father’s Lodge had caught the gleaming of the Great Masonic past; Thinking, tolling, daring, dreaming, they were builders to the last. Quiet men, not rich nor clever, with the tools they found at hand Building for the great forever, first a village, then a land. Father’s Lodge no temple builded, shaped of steel and carved of stone; Marble columns, ceilings gilded, father’s Lodge has never known. But a heritage of glory they have left, the humble onee— They have left their mighty story In the keep - ing of their Sons."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"16 MONITOIUAL 17 ENTERED APPRENTICE QUALIFICATIONs OP CANDIDATES The qualifications which are essential in those who apply for initiation Into the mysteries of Preemasonry are of two kinds; Internal and External.

The Common Gavel Is an instrument made use of by operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builders’ use; but we, as Free and Accepted Ma - sons, are taught to make use of It for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all> Ihe vices and super - flulties of life, thereby fitting our minds as living stones, for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"26 MONITORIAL MONITORIAL SECOND SECTION The degree of Entered Apprentice is divided Into three sections.

Covering, Furniture, Ornaments, Lights, and Jewels; how situated and to whom dedicated. A Lodge is a certain number of Freemasons, duly assembled, with the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, and a Charter, or Warrant, from a Grand Lodge, authorizing them to meet and work. Our ancient Brethren held their meetings on high hills and In low vales, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, as - cending or descending, and to guard against surprise. The Form of a Lodge is an oblong square ex - tending from East to West, between North and South, from the center to the circumference, and from earth to heaven. It is said to be of such vast dimensions to denote the universality of Freemasonry, and that a Freemason’s charity should know no bounds. The Supports of a Lodge are three, denomi - nated Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty: because there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and Im - portant undertakings. The Covering of a Lodge is no less than the clouded canopy, or star-decked heaven, where all good E’reemasons hope at last to arrive by the aid of that theological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw extending from earth to heaven, the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity; which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of Immortality, and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these Is charity; for our faith may be lost in sight; hope ends In fruition; but charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundiess realms of eternity. The Furniture of a Lodge consists of the Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses. The Holy Bible Is dedicated to God, the Square to the Master, and the Compasses to the Craft. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God because It is His inestImable gift to man, * * 5; the Square to the Master because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compasses to the Craft, because by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe their desires and keep their passions In due bounds. The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Teasel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the Indented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded It, with the Blazing Star in the center. The Mosaic Pave - ment is emblematic of human life, checkered with good and evil; the Indented Teasel, or tea - selated border, of the manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm reilance on Divine Providence, hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star. The Lights of a Lodge are three, situated in the South, West, and East. There is none in the North because King Solomon’s Temple was built so far north of the ecliptic that the Sun and Moon, at their meridian height, shone upon these three points only, the fourth remaining In dark - ness. The North is therefore Masonically termed a place of darknesa. The Jewels of a Lodge are six; three movable and three immovable. The Immovable Jewels are the Square, the Level, and the Plumb. The Square inculcates morality: the Level equallty, and the Plumb rec - titude of conduct. They are said to be immov - able because their principles are fixed. The movable Jewels are the Rough Ashiar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle-Board. The"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"30 MONITORTAL N~ONITORIAL 31 Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quar - ry in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashiar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman to be adjusted by the working tools of the Fellow Craft. The Trestle-Board is for the Master Workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Per - fect Ashiar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle-Board we are also reminded that as the operative workman erects his temporal build - ing agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle-Board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building in accordance with the de - signs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Great Book of Nature and Reve - lation, which is our spiritual, moral and Masonic Trestle-Board. A Lodge is situated due East and West, be- cause after Moses had conducted the Children of Israel through the Red Sea, he, by divine com - mand, erected a Tabernacle In the Wilderness, which he placed due East and West, to com - memorate that mighty east wind which wrought their miraculous deliverance. A pattern of the Tabernacle was exhibited to Moses In the Mount. Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solo - mon, as he was our first Most Worshipful Grand Master; but Freemasons of the present day dedi - cate theirs to St. John the Baptist, and St. Jol’ln the Evangelist, two eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time there is represented In every regular and well governed Lodge a certain point within a circle embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing these two Saints; and upon the vertex of the circle rests the Holy Bible. The point represents an individual Brother; the circle, the boundary line of his duty, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, preju - dices, or interests to betray him. In going around this circle we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Bible; and while a Freemason keeps himself circum - scribed within their precepts, It Is impossible that he should materially err. The Tenets of a Freemason’s profession are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family—the high, the low, the rich, the poor—who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and protect each other. On this prin - ciple, Freemasonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion; and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men but particularly on Freemasons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compas - sionate their miseries and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Freemasonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by Its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain deal - ing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"32 MON ITORIAL MON5TORIAL 33 PERFECT POINTS OF ENTRANCE • * • • S S 5 * 5 * S S * Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice.

By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will result a due propor - tion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and Inclemencies of the seasons and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, in the choice as well as In the arrangement, of the sundry materials of which an edifice Is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted In man for the best, most salutary, and beneficent pur- poses. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the con - templative to view, with reverence and admira - tion, the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfec - tions of his Divine Creator. We work in Speculative Masonry, but our an - cient Brethren wrought in both Operative and Speculative. They worked at the building of King Solomon’s Temple, and many other sacred and Masonic edifices. r MONITORIAL They worked six days in the week, and rested upon the seventh, for in six days God created the heaven and the earth, and rested upon the sev - enth day; the seventh, therefore, our ancient Brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their lal,ors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of creation, and to adore their great Creator.

From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at the top and bot - torn are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan. Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. The ancient and original orders of architecture, revered by Freemasons, are no more than three; the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which were in- vented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two: The Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, how - ever, show invention and particular character and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally; the Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Corinthian enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, are we indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. * * * * * * * * * * * * * the five human senses—Hearing, SeeIng, Feeling. Smelling, and Tasting; the first three of which are deemed peculiarly essential among Free - masons, * * * * * * * * * * * * Thisbringsus * * * * * * * * * the seven liberal arts and sciences—Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. Grammar is the science which teaches us to express our ideas in appropriate words, which we may afterward beautify and adorn by means of Rhetoric. Logic instructs us how to think and reason with propriety and to make language subordinate to thought Arithmetic, which is the science of computing by numbers, is absolutely essential, not only to a thorough knowledge of all mathematical science, but also to a proper pursuit of our daily vocations. Geometry treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered—from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a solid. A point is the beginning of all geometrical matter. A line is the continuation of the same. A superficies is length and breadth without thickness. A solid is length and breadth with thickness, which may form a cube, and comprehends the whole. By this science, the architect is enabled to con - struct his plans and execute his designs; the general to arrange his soldiers; the engineer to mark out grounds for encampments; the geog - rapher to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of em - pires, kingdoms and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"42 MONITORIAL and to fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the foun - dation of architecture, and the root of the math - ematlos. Music is that elevated science which affects the passions by sound. There are few who have not felt Its charms, and acknowledged its ex - pressions to be Intelligible to the heart. It Is a language of delightful sensations, far more elo - quent than words; it breathes to the ear the clearest intimations; It touches and gently agi - tates the agreeable and sublime passions; it wraps us in melancholy and elevates us In joy; it dissolves and inflames; it melts us in tender - ness, and excites us to war. This science is truly congenial to the nature of man; for by Its powerful charms the most discordant passions may be harmonized and brought into perfect unison; but it never sounds with such seraphic harmony as when employed in singing hymns of gratitude to the great Creator of the Universe. Astronomy is that sublime science which in- spires the contemplative mind to soar aloft, and read the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the great Creator in the Heavens. How nobly elo - quent of the Deity is the celestial hemisphere!— spangled with the most magnificent heralds of His infinite glory! They speak to the whole uni - verse; for there is no speech so barbarous, but their language is understood; nor nation so dis - tant, but their voices are heard among them. “The heavens proclaim the glory of God; the firmament declareth the works of His hands.” Assisted by astronomy, we ascertain the laws which govern the heavenly bodies and by which their motions are directed, investigate the power by which they circulate in their orbs, discover their size, determine their distance, explain their r MONITORIAL 43 various phenomena and correct the fallacy of tkie senses by the Ught of truth.

This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being liii- proved by time and experience, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignor - ance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force.

Our laws and regu - lations you are strenuously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly exe - outed. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offenses of your Brethren, but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and repre - hend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, Is earnestly recom - mended to your consideration; especially the science of Geometry, which is established as the basIs of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, origi - nally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while It proves the wonderful prop - erties of nature, it demonstrates the more im - portant truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now con - ferred; and in your new character, it Is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Order by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue.

The Three Steps, usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet, are emblematic of the three principal stages of human life: Youth, Man - hood, and Age. In youth, as Entered Appren - tices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in man - hood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor and ourselves; so that in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflections consequent on a well spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality.

The Bee Hive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven to the lowest repttle in the dust. It teaches us that as we came into the wor]d rational and In - telUgent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down content while our fel - low creatures around us are In want, when it is lii our power to relieve them. When we take a survey of nature, we view man In his infancy, more helpless and Indigent than the brute creation; he lies languish Lng for days, mont~bs, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or of sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent of all other beings; but as depend - ence is one of the strongest bonds of society. mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby en - joy better opportunities o! fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and under - standing, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, and un - worthy of our protection as Freemasons.

The Anchor and Ark are emblems of a well grounded hope, and a well-spent life. They are emblematic of that Divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that Anchor which shall safely moor us In a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary shall find rest. The Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid was discovered by our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into the several orders of priesthood and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly In a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most distinguished, he erected this, when in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed “Eureka,” signifying “I have found it”; and on the discovery of which he is said to have sacri - ficed a hecatomb.

Duty and honor now alike bind you to be faithful to every trust; to support the dignity of your chaxacter on all occasions; and strenu - ously to enforce, by precept and example, a steady obedience to the tenets of Freemasonr3r. Exemplaxy conduct on your part will convince the world that merit is the just title to our privileges, and that on you our favors have not been undeservedly bestowed. In this respectable character you are author - Ized to correct the Irregularities of your less informed Brethren, to fortify their minds with r~olution against the snares of the insidious, and to guard them against every allurement to vicious practices. To preserve unsullied the reputation of the Fraternity ought to be your constant care; and, therefore, it becomes your province to caution the inexperienced against a breach of fidelity. To your Inferiors in rank or office you are to recommend obedience and submission; to your equals, courtesy and alf a - bility; to your superiors, Idndness and conde - scension. Universal benevolence you are zealous - ly to Inculcate; and by the regularity of your own conduct, endeavor to remove every asper - sion against this venerable Institution. Our an - cient landmarks you axe carefully to preserve,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"56 MONITOIHAL MON ITOBIAL and not to suffer them on any pretense to be infringed, or countenance a deviation from our established customs. Your honor and reputation are alike con - cerned in supporting with dignity the respectable character you now bear. Let no motive, there- lore, make you swerve from your duty, violate your vows, or betray your trust; but be true and faithful and imitate the example of that cele - brated Artist whom you have this evening rep - resented. Thus you will render yourself deserv - ing of the honor which we have conferred, and worthy of the confidence we have reposed in you. (At the ciose of the charge, the Master shouid return to his station and address the candidate as !oiiOWS.) Brother We now receive you as a Master Mason, and a member of Lodge No 0! the Jurisdiction of New Mexico. As such you are now entitled to all the rights and privileges of the Fratermty, wherever dispersed throughout the globe. There is a proficiency lecture for this degree which should be committed to memory, and on which you should stand examination, as in the preceding degrees. A knowledge of this lecture is essential in visiting other Lodges, therefore, let me urge that you meet with your instructor and master this lecture at the earliest practicable date If you pass a satisfactory examination on this lecture before the expiration of 70 days, the Grand Lodge will issue to you, free of charge, a Master Mason’s Ccrtificate of Proficiency, which is invaluable as documentary evidence of your having received the degrees of Freemasonry. If examination is passed after the eicpiration of ‘70 days from this date, a nominal charge will be made foi’ this Certificate. I may add that one must have this Certificate before being eligible to a stationed office in the Lodge, or petition for any additional degrees. I will now explain to you the use of the Gavel, which is the emblem of the power and authority of the Master. One rap * with it calls the Lodge to order, and should always be promptly obeyed. When given, calling the name of an officer or member, it causes him only to rise; thus: Brother Senior Deacon. • (S. D. rises.) When up, one rap seats him * (S. D. takes his seat.) Two raps • * (all officers rise, except Master) cause all officers to rise. When up, one rap (officers are seated) seats them. Three raps cause all the officers and Brothers to rise, ~* (all rise). When up, one rap seats them, * (all are seated). There are two methods of voting In a Masonic Lodge; first, by hallot, black and white balls, for the degrees or for affiliation, and by written ballots, for election of officers, and In Masonic trials. Second, In the usual routine work of the Lodge, by the uplifted right hand, thus (illus - trates), which Is used to express your assent to or dissent from a motion, as you desire. The secrecy of the ballot must be maintained. It Is un-Masonic for any Brother to divulge outside of t~ie Lodge any infonnation on discussions In the Lodge, regarding petitions or on his personal vote, or on the result of ballots on petitions. While the Lodge is open, it is improper for any Brother to pass between the Altar and the East, except. Ing during the conferring of degrees, or in certain other ceremonies, when it is necessary for certain officers to pass through this space in order to properly perform their duties To put or second a motion, to discuss business, or otherwise to speak In Lodge, a member should always rise, address the Worshipful Master (at the same time make the due guard of the degree, holding same until recognized by the Worship - ful Master, then make appropriate penal sign) and continue to face the Master while speaking. In taking the degrees it may have occurred to you that the penalties of the obligations were"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"58 MONITOHIAL MONITOBIAL unreasonable and unenforceable. These penalties are expressed in symbolical form. The obsecra - tin of a Mason simply means that If he violates his vow or betrays his trust he is worthy of such penalty, and that if such penalty were inflicted on him it would be but just and proper. The ritual penalties of Masonry, supposing such to be, are in the hands not of man, but of God, and are to be inflicted by God, and not by man. Nevertheless the obligations will be completely binding on you, and if ever you violate your ob - ligations you may be brought to trial by your Lodge. SOLILOQUY (optional) Alas! The horrid deed is done. Here, cold and mute, wrapped in the cloak of death, the Mas - ter sleeps. Ah, yes! That dreamless slumber that knows no waking. Sleep on my Master, sleep on. No more the pomp and pageantry of power—no more the crowd of craftsmen hasten - ing to do his deep designs—no more the temple In all its grandeur and beauty towering above the hills and beckoning Heaven to rest upon its stately columns; no more shall these his high ambitions gratify. Oh Death untimely! Yet, Oh timely Death! Stricken from life while fresh his honors clustered! Before the breath of calumny could mar the splendor of his deeds or slander smirch the worth of his achieve - ments—he has fallen—yielding up all—all the world holds dear—riches, power, everything, but holding fast to his Masonic secrets. Oh rare Integrity! Oh fortitude most grand! To him in future years shall countless thousands praise and laud his name, who death preferred than faithless prove, than trust betray. But, Grand Master, though well kept, your secret stands revealed. It is in these three words ccmtalned: Truth, Honor, Fortitude. (Bell) But bark! The midnight bell tolls the hour of meeling. Oh, God! It does seem that the very stais do weep tonight. Must I bear this burden all alone? But no—my comrades come. BIBLE PRESENTATION My Brother, I hold in my hands the Book of Books, the HOLY BiBLE. Howscever men differ in creed or theology, all good men are agreed that within the covers of the Holy Bible are found those principles of morality that lay the foundation upon which to build a righteous life. Freemasonry, therefore, places this BOOK upon its altars, with the command to each of its votaries, that he diligently study therein to find the way to ever - lasting life. Adopting no particular creed, f or- bidding sectarian discussion within Its Lodge Rooms, and encouraging each to be steadfast in the faith of his acceptance, Freemasonry takes all good men by the hand, and leading them to its altars, points to the Holy Bible thereon and urges upon each that he faithfully direct his steps through life by the light he there shall find and as he there shall find it. If we, as Masons, are to obey this injunction which each of us has received, we must have a proper conception of just what the GREAT LIGHT is and how it has come down to us. And our understanding may well begin with recog - nition of the significant fact that the Church and Religion did not grow out of the Bible, the Bible grew out of Religion and the Church. A number of men living close to the heart and thought of God, and therefore inspired by Him, picked up, used In this great task and laid down in their turn, the working tools of life during a span of hundreds of years.

One was a historian, another a poet, another a theologian or a preacher, a teller of stories or a user of parables. So the Great Light which has illumined men’s steps through the centuries, is not merely a book, but a whole library of sixty - six books of widely different content, but all filled with the revelation of God’s love for man, HIS purpose for man and man’s effort to reach up to HIM. The HOLY BIBLE Is the world’s supreme record of man’s experience and Faith. It is the Ma - son’s trestleboard in character building. In this Book are laid down the principles of successful living. Its great men loom large upon the background of the world’s history. They lived, they fought, they loved, they sinned, they re - pented. And they have left behind them—here— the testimony that the keeping of God’s laws and the doing of God’s will, are the things worth living for. We need to know the Bible, to learn its precepts, to reverence it as our great book friend. And, my Brother, that your feet may not falter, that your path may be well lighted, your Lodge has commissioned me to place in your hands this evening, your very own personal copy of the GREAT LIGHT, with the prayer that it may indeed be a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your path ALWAYS A MASON By Douglas Mailoch Let no king quite put off his crown I I still would have him kingly when In some old inn the king sat down To banquet with his serving men.

So with a Mason: I would see Him somewhat of a Mason still, Though far from Lodge-rooms he may be. In court, or counting house, or win. Whatever garment he may doff, What mark Masonic lay aside, I would not have him quite put off The Craft he lately glorified. A soldier is a soldier, though He lays the sword aside awhile.

Only the most essential points of this subject can be presented in the limited space available herein. These have been extracted from Masonic Parliamentary Law by Albert 0. Mackey, which work is designated by the Grand Lodge of New ~Iexico to govern all deliberations in this Grand Jurisdiction. GENERAL In applying the rules of parliamentary proce - dure, an initial distinction must be made between the work of a Lodge (Reception of candidates and conferring of degrees) and the business of a Lodge. The work of a Lodge is the sole re - sponsibility of the Master, is to be done at his will and pleasure and is In no way subject to parliamentary law or procedure. The business of a Lodges i.e. conduct of fiscal a~fa1rs, etc., is the area in which parliamentary procedures are applicable. QUORUM No business may be transacted unless there be present at least seven Master Masons who are members of the Lodge. PRESIDING OFFICER The Master, or the Senior or Junior Warden or Past Master presiding in his stead, is in complete control of the Lodge. He is responsible for moderating discussions and debates, putting motions presented for vote, declaring the results of voting and deciding all points of order. In the conduct of these duties he is to be governed"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MISCELLANEOUS 73 72 MISCELLANEOUS by parliamentary procedures. However, his de - cisions are final and there is no appeal from such decisions except to the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge. MOTIONS In general, motions are of two types, principal and subsidiary. A principal motion is one that proposes to express some fact, opinion, principle or course of action A subsidiary motion is one that is Intended to amend or control the dis - position of a principal motion. A third clasa of motion, so-called “dilatory motions” are In - admissible in Masonic Lodges They consist of motions to adjourn or motions to adjourn to a certain day Since a Masonic Lodge is convened, opened and closed at the will and pleasure of the Master, any motion to adjourn is always out of order. PRINCIPAL MOTIONS A principal motion may be offered only when no other motion is pending To properly pre - sent a motion, a member should rise, address the Master, and upon being recognized by the Master, proceed to offer the motion. The proper form is: “1 move In order to be en - tertained, a principal motlon must be seconded. If a second Is not offered, the motion fails and cannot be considered. Any member may require that any motion be reduced to writing. If a principal motion is offered and seconded, and is not ruled out of order by the Master. It becomes the property of the Lodge and must be disposed of in accordance with the accepted rules of Masonic parilamentary procedure. For the purpose of an orderly presentation, subsidiary motions will be considered later in this discussion. DEBATE Debates on motions before a Masonic Lodge must always be conducted In harmony with the fraternal principles of the Institution. The strict - est courtesy, decorum and good order must always be observed. The purpose of debate in a Lodge is to elicit truth and not simply to secure victory. The Master is In complete control of the debate and a motion for the previous question, used in other organizations to stifle debate, Is wholly in- admissible in a Masonic Lodge. A motion to adjourn the debate may be entertained by the Master, although it is entirely within his pre - rogative to rule such a motion out of order. If a motion to adjourn the debate is entertained, It is to be governed by these rules: 1. It may not be offered by any member who has already spoken on the question neing considered. 2. It must be seconded. 3. Unless withdrawn by general consent, It must be put to a vote and debate on the question which was under consideration must be suspended until such vote has been taken. 4. If adopted, when the debate on the original motion is resumed it assumes the exact status it had when the debate was ad - journed. This motion does not call the ques - tion, it merely terminates the debate. 5. If defeated, it may not be reoffered, and debate is resumed on the principal motion. No member shall speak more than once to the same question without the permission of the Master, unless he be the person who intro - duced the matter, in which case he shall be permitted to reply, but only after every other member desiring to speak shall have been heard."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"I — 74 MIsCgLLANEOUs In exercising this privilege he shall confine himself to replying to matters raised In the de - bate and shall not introduce any new matter. THE VOTE After the debate has been concluded the Master shall “put the question.” The affirmative must be put first, then the negative. This shall be done in substance as follows: “So many as are in favor of the motion will signify the same (by raising the right hand)” or “(by the usual voting sign of a Mason)”; then, “SO many as are of a contrary opinion will make the same sign.” If the number of votes on each side of the question are so unequal as to present no diff I - culty in deciding which number is greater, the Master shall proceed to announce the result and shall not entertain any request for a division. If, however, the number of votes is so nearly even as to leave the matter in doubt, the Master may direct that the vote be taken again; or if. after announcing the result any member is dissatisfied, he may immediately call for a division. A request for a division must be en - tertained if offered immediately after the result of a vote is announced. A request ror a division after other business has intervened is out of order. A division in a Masonic Lodge is had by the Master requesting members voting in the affirmative to stand and directing the Senior Deacon to make a count and communicate to him the result, after which these members are requested to be seated; then requesting members voting in the negative to stand and following the same procedure to secure a count. The Master of a Masonic Lodge is entitled to a vote on any question coming before his Lodge, and in case of a tie, is also entitled to an additional “casting” or tie-breaking vote. As MISC~LLAN~OUS 75 a matter of fraternal courtesy, the Master should explain to the Lodge the reasons which prompt a “casting” vote. The vote on any question is not complete until both the affirmative and negative have been put; therefore, It is in order for any mem - ber to speak, if he has not spoken before, after the affirmative vote has been taken and before the negative vote Is taken. This is Uttle used and although in order, should be avoided. Unless otherwise provided in the Constitution and/or By-Laws, a simple majority shall decide any question In announcing the result of a vote, the Master shall say in substance: “The ayes have It—the motion is adopted;” or “The nays have it—The motion Is lost.” If a specified majority is required by the Constitution and/or By-Laws, the announcement shall be in sub - stance: “Two-thirds (or such majority as is sped - f led) of the members present having voted in the affirmative (or negative), the motion is adopted (or lost) .“ SUBSIDIARY MOTIONS Subsidiary motions which can be accepted in a Masonic Lodge, arranged In the order of pre - cedence, are as follows: 1 To ile on the table 2 To postpone indefinitely 3. To postpone to a time certain 4. To commit 5. To amend Since motions to amend are the type most fre - quently offered, and since the other subsidiary motions affect only the time or method of con - sideration, motions to amend will be considered first. Motions to amend are of three types: (1) to delete certain words; (2) to Insert certain words; (3) to delete certain words and to Insert others. A motion to delete certain words should be so"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"76 MISCELLANEOUS MISCELLANEOUS 77 offered as to retain coherence and grammatical constructon. A motion to insert certain words should also be worded so as to retain proper sense in the final form. Neither may be re - offered in the same form if once defeated. A motion to delete certain words and insert other words may be offered as a whole or may be di - vided, If divided, the portion to delete will be offered first and if it is defeated, the portion to insert cannot be offered. If the question to de - lete Is adopted, the question to insert will then be offered. If the question to insert is defeated the entire motion is defeated and the principal motion reverts to its original form. Since amendments are also subject to amend - ment, a rule must be drawn to keep amendments to amendments from going on ad infinitum. The rule is that an amendment may be offered to an amendment, referred to as amending to the sec - ond degree, but additional attempts to amend an amendment are out 01 order. Amendments must be put to a vote prior to a vote on the original question. Amendments in the second degree will be put first; amendments in the first degree will be put in the order they are received. If an amendment or amendments are defeated, the question must be put on the original motion. If one or more amendments are adopted, the question shall be put on the original motion as amended. Other subsidiary motions take precedence over motions to amend and over each other accord - ing to a definite priority. These are discussed in the descending order of priority, i.e., the first has highest priority, the second has the next order of priority, etc. A motion to lie on the table is not debatable and must be put when offered. This motion Is generally considered a “death blow” to a propo - sition, since such a proposition is seldom taken up again. A motion to postpone Indefinitely is debat - able to a limited degree on Its merits. If adopted it effectively rejects the original motion since It may not be reconsidered at the same communi - cation of the Lodge. A motion to postpone to a time certain Is de - batable on his merits but is seldom if ever used in a Lodge. It merely delays consideration of the original motion to some set time in the future. A motion to commit is debatable. A motion to commit (refer to a committee) is generally used to conserve the time of the Lodge when a matter comes up which requires more investiga - tion. When a motion to commit is adopted, the original motion which is referred to a committee is not reconsidered until the committee reports INCIDENTAL QUESTIONS Incidental questions, those arising during the course of a debate, are always in order and temporarily take precedence over the proposi - tion under debate. Those which will most fre - quently arise in a Masonic Lodge are: (1) ques - tions of order; (2) questIons for reading papers: and (3) questions on leave to withdraw motions A question of order concerns the propriety of current proceedings When a member rises to a point of order the Master shall request the member to state the point and shall decide upon It prior to permitting any proceedings to continue. Mackey cites the following as gen - erally accepted rules of order appilcable to the conduct of business in Masonic Lodges: 1)—Two Independent motions may not be pre - sented at the same time. Subsidiary mo - tions may be presented, but one independ -"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"78 MSCELLANEOUS MISCELLANEOUS 79 ent motion must be decided before another can be considered. 2)—Subsidiary motions must be offered in their rank of preference. 3)—A member must always address himself to the Master and not to some other officer or member. 4)—The Master shall be the sole judge of who has the floor 5)—A member is not to be Interrupted when speaking, except for the purpose of calling him to order. 6)—No member (except the original proposer) shall Speak more than once to the same question, except with the Master’s permis - sion 7)—No member shall disturb the speaker by unseemly conduct. 8)—No personality, abusive remarks or other Improper language shall be used. 9)—If the Master desires to speak when any member has the floor, the member shall be seated that the Master may be heard. (10)—Every member who secures the floor must speak to the question under consideration. A question for reading a paper is in order pro - vided the paper has a direct bearing on the matter being debated This is to assure that members may be fully informed before voting on any question. A question on leave to withdraw a motion re - quires unanimous consent of the Lodge. It Is usually not necessary to put this motion to a vote. When such a motion is offered, if no ob - jection is stated leave is granted by the Master to withdraw the motion If any member objects to withdrawal of a motion, the motion may not be withdrawn but must be put to a vote. INCIDENTAL QUESTIONS WHICH ARE OUT OF ORDER The question of suspending a rule (by-law) is always out of order in a Masonic Lodge. Since all changes to by-laws of a constituent Lodge must be approved by the Grand Master before they go into effect and since suspension of a by-law Is a change, even if it is only temporary, a constituent Lodge is without power to suspend a by-law. A question of calling for the yeas and nays. I e., recording individually the vote of each mem - ber, is also always out of order In a constituent Lodge. QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE Questions of privilege take precedence over any other business and should be considered when brought before the Lodge. Questions of privilege are subject to being laid on the table, post - poned indefinitely or postponed to a time certain Mackey lists the following as examples of ques - tions of privilege: (1) Any matter affecting the character of a member. (2) Any matter affecting the character, secrecy or safety of a Lodge. SPECIAL ORDERS Matters postponed to a time certain or made special orders may be brought up by any mem - ber at the appointed time and take precedence over all other business if called up at that time. If called up, they may be disposed of or further postponed. It is the privilege but not the dut’y of any member or the Master to cali for mat - ters that have been postponed to a certain time or made special orders when the appointed time arrives. However, if such matters are not called up, they lose their precedence."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MISCELLANEOUS 80 MISCELLANEOUS ORDER OF BUSINESS The order of business prescribed by this Grand Lodge is: 1.

A plural member shall not be ellgible to hold office simultaneously in more than one Lodge. No member of a constituent Lodge in this Grand Jurisdiction shall be eligible for electIon to the office of Master or Warden unless he be the holder of a Master Mason’s Certificate of Prof iclency as provided in the Grand Lodge By-Laws. Comments and Suggestions The 01 flce of Master of a Masonic Lodge Is one of great antiquity, dignity and respect; It is an honor to which any Master Mason may laudably aspire; it should not be approached with the thought of enhancing his own honor and renown, but rather as furnishing an op - ‘1 portunity for rendering a very special service to the Craft. Having set his footsteps In the direction of the Master’s station, one is im - mediately faced with the necessity of making numerous decisions, one of the most important of which will reflect his attitude with respect to whether he will really work at the task or drift complacently along. “To see how lIttle we can do, is to exist; to see how much we can do, is to live.” To live our Freemasonry requires some earnest and serious thought. The quality of our Freemasonry cannot rise above the level of our thinking, and our thinking is not likely to rise above the level of our knowledge. Therefore, the chief concern of the Master-to- be is his personal preparation for the task This will include preparation for Lodge Work and Lodge AdmInistration. A correct knowledge of the Work, both writ - ten and unwritten, and an understanding of the basic business principles and the rules of order governing the deliberations of a Lodge are equally important. A Master should be thoroughly familiar with the ritual as taught in this Grand Jurisdiction and should demand of his Degree teams every conscientious effort toward perfection In floor work, the spoken word and expressIon To that end there must be study and practice and ses - sIons with the Grand Lecturer or your District Deputy Lecturer, then more study and more practice and more sessions with the qualIfied Lecturers. To be completely familiar with the Grand Lodge By-Laws and those of his own Lodge Is of prime Importance to the Master. The Ancient Charges and Regulations, the dutIes recited at the Installation of a Master, the Landmarks and Lodge ceremonies should be reviewed frequently. And not to be forgotten are those reservoirs I"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"84 MISCELLANEOUS MISCELLANEOUS of knowledge and useful information to be found among the Past Masters and other ex - perienced Brethren. Having made his proper personal preparation, the Master will enter upon his term of office with confidence in his ability to plan the affairs of the Lodge and provIde that certain quality of leadership which will bring the greatest ci-edit to the Fraternity, because there must be: Planning In order to promote action Proper example to encourage Dignity without being haughty Courtesy without being obsequious Firmness without being a.rrogant Patience without being negligent Friendliness without being partial Masonic Parliamentary Law by Albert G. Mackey govecns the deliberations of the Lodges in this Grand Jurisdiction. Some of the perti - nent points on the subject will be found in this Monitor. Each Lodge meeting should be opened prompt - ly at the stated or called time, and the business or Work of the Lodge conducted with that certain studied and measured dignity which commands and holds the respect and attaition of all present. The wise Master will always, so far as pcu - sible, discuss his plans with the Wardens, thus assuring the continued continuity of the Lodge activities in the event of his unexpected abamice. THE WARD~S El~Ibl1ity No member of a constituent Lodge in this Grand Jurisdiction ahall be eligible for election to the office of Master or Warden unless he be the holder of a Master Mason’s Certificate of Proficiency as provided in the Grand Lodge By - Laws. Comments and Suggestions Although the duties of the Master are set out in much greater detail and therefore prob - ably much better understood than those of the Wardens, both of these officers have duties to perform in assisting the Master, and each may actually be called upon to preside in the East The thoughtful Warden will, therefore, be zealous in his preparation to assume even the temporary duty of the absent Master, Our Wardens occupy “stations,” whereas all other officers of lesser rank are designated “places.” Symbolically the stations represent the sun in a certain position and are not to be vacated while the Lodge is at Labor except In the performance of ceremonial duties. If other - wIse necessary to leave the station, the Master should be informed and he will designate a temporary substitute. In Masonry, the gavel is an emblem of au - thority. Each Warden, therefore, has a gavel to indicate that he has a part in the govern - ment of the Lodge. Each Warden also has a column which he erects at his station when he I. in charge of the Craft and lowers when his period of supervision is ended. The Secior Warden is stationed In the West; when the Master is absent, he assumes the station and prerogatives of that office; he is in charge of the Craft during the hours of Labor; the column on his pedestal Is the Pillar of Strength; his jewel is the Level; his specific duty is to pay the Craft their wages. He should be careful to remember that proper encourage - ment, thoughtful assistance and timely praise and cowimendation are most excellent coins with which to pay the wages due. The Junior Warden is stationed in the South; he Is in charge of the Craft during the hours of refreshment; when the Master and Senior War-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"86 MISCELLANEOUS den are absent, he pi esides in the East; the column on his pedestal is the Pillar of Beauty; his jewel Is the Plumb; his specific duties are no less Important than those of the Senior Warden, even though they control the Craft while at i efreshment Immediately upon his election to the South, he should embark upon an intensive and comprehensive program of study and reading in preparation for his further ad - vancement. THE TREASURER Although without gavel or column to denote any special authority with respect to the Work of the Lodge, the office of Treasurer is never - theless a most important one in connection with Its fiscal affairs Even though his Lodge is one of the smaller ones, the Treasurer should never, either for con - venience or as an accommodation, deposit Lodge funds in his personal bank account. The courts have repeatedly held that mixing trust funds with personal funds constitutes conversion, or larceny. All of the Lodge funds should be de - posited in the name or the Lodge and withdrawn only by Lodge check. In the larger Lodges, where funds and/or in- vestments may be substantial, the question of a bond for the Treasurer may quite appropriately be raised The Treasurer should not feel this to be a reflection on his integrity. It is only good business that the Lodge be fully protec~d. The premium for the bond should be paid by the Lodge. THE SECRETARY The Secretary is frequently, and quite cor - rectly, referred to as the “work horse” of the Lodge He might with equal accuracy be called the “Confidential” or “Executive”’ officer of the Lodge. Every single matter affecting the Lodge passes over his desk, and in a large measure F— MISCELLANEOUS 87 the welfare of the Lodge rests upon the prompt, proper and correct handling of these items. As the officer who most frequently comes in contact with the greatest number of the mem - bers, and as the principal correspondent ror the official written contacts outside the Lodge, he enjoys the best opportunity to be of the greatest service to his Lodge in particular and the Fra - ternity in general Also, the competent Secre - retary will be ever ready and willing to render all possible assistance to the Master by making available to him timely information, statistics, etc. It will thus be apparent that service is the watchword of the office, but It must be an un - derstanding, courteous and tactful service and never extend to the unsurpatlon of the duties of any of the other Lodge officers. While the Secretary is charged with receiving all moneys from the Brethren, there are times when he must remind some of them that such moneys are due. And there are some members who actual¶y prefer to be timely notified that dues are payable. These tasks call for a knowl - edge of his duties, a recognition of the limita - tions of courtesy, an understanding of the best approach for each member with respect to money matters, and the ability to make the members realize and appreciate that dues and such are not “gremlins” personally invented by the Secretary but are necessary evils governed by Lodge and Grand Lodge By-Laws. THE CHAPLAIN “The duties of every Chaplain must begin with the essential characteristics of reverence for all that the mantle of charity means in such an institution as Is ours Acts of charity mci it reverent care, and he who holds them In rever - ence and preserves the memory of them is a Chaplain indeed.” The prayers in our Ritual are given in the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"88 MISCELLANEOUS MISCELLANEOUS 89 Monitor, but quite often the Chaplain is called upon to lead us in devotion at dinners, ban - quets, or public places. He should be careful to phrase his prayers, grace, invocations and bene - dictions in words acceptable to all faiths. All faiths believe in a Supreme Being, so it is safe to address his prayers to a Heavenly Father or Supreme Architect of the Universe As Free - masonry Is composed of men of various faiths, this should be taken into consideration par - ticularly by the Chaplain. THE DEACONS The Deacons are the active agents of the officers they respectively serve; both may be sent to any part of the Lodge, but the special duties of the Senior Deacon take him between the East and the West, while those of the Junior Deacon are between the West and the South. The office of Senior Deacon is one of honoi and responsibility. He has charge of the Altar and the Great Lights under the direction of the Master. The Holy Bible should be handled with care and reverence at all times When ordered to prepare the ballot, it is his duty to ascertain that there are ballots of both colors in the ballot box He should remember that he is the direct and active i epresentative of the Master, that he fills a position which is midway up the line of progression, and should, therefore, combine hu - mflity with executive firmness which have come through disciplined and experienced service In the lower offices He should now begin to take upon himself a degree of easy, graceful, kindly and hospitable dignity which comes with in- creasing authority and which is required by his new duties. The Junior Deacon guards the outer door of the Lodge and assists in protecting its proceed - ings against intrusion of those not qualified in enter Permission to enter or leave the Lodge and Instructions to the Tyler are given through him. His ritualistic duties are not numerous but quite important. His main objective should be the preparation for the larger role and greater responsibilities which will come with his promotion. THE MARSHAL The duties of the Marshal may be said to be principally concerned with public processions wader the direction of the Master. Much of the order and beauty of Masonic public affairs de - pends upon his knowledge and skill. Probab]~ at no other Masonic ceremony will he have the opportunity to create that certain favorable public opinlA)n of the Fraternity than at a Masonic funeral, where he should strive to the utmost of his ability to conduct the required processions with sur9ness of direction, precision of movement and dignity of bearing. THE STEWARDS The duties of the Senior and Junior Stewarde are quite specifically mentioned at the time of installation — to assist the Deacons and other officers in performing their respective duties. One of their most important duties is to assist the Senior Deacon in the preparation of candi - dates. At the time of the candidate’s first re - ception the Stewards should, by their own tact - ful and efficient performance of their duties, impress upon him the real significance of the ceremonies of initiation. THE TYL~ Though last in the list of officers, the Tyler is not the least important. Without him, the Lodge cannot proceed to business; nor, having commenced its business, would it be safe to eontinue should the Tyler desert his post. In addition to his primary duty of guarding the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"90 MISCELLANEOUS MISCELLANEOUS 91 Lodge against intrusion of improper persons, the Tyler also prepares the Lodge room for meetings by arranging the furniture, hghts, regalia, etc. The visiting Brother receives his first impression of the Lodge from the gentlemanly deportment and exercise of tact and judgment of the Tyler. MASONIC ETIQUETTE Masonic Etiquette is a code of conduct of conventions to be observed by Masons in the Lodge room, between Masons, and between Ma - sons and the profane. It is that quality of con— duct which distinguishes a conscientious Mason both in and out of the Lodge. Your attention is particularly directed toward this system of conduct because the measure of its observance will distinguish you among all men as one striv - ing to preserve and perpetuate the virtues and tenets of our Fraternity. Conventions are the rules which society makes for itself, without the force of law, by which Its members live together with the least friction. Masonry has developed Is own conventions by which Its members govern their acts in Lodge and the anteroom. Not to proceed according to their dictates is not a Masonic offense; it Is merely a lack or Masonic manners. Time has proven that man cannot be made good by legislation; that no elaborate system of laws can change his nature, sharpen his conscience or soften his emotions; yet the unit of mortality and human progress is the individ - ual. Hence, to the individual Masonry opens her treasure storehouse. By lessons — mainly sym - bolical — Masonry points the way for him to design his rules of conduct; seeks through knowl - edge to make him wise, that in his wisdom he may learn the disciplines which make men free; seeks to make him merciful in judgment and just in action; seeks to make him patient and forbearing, understanding of the faults and failures which lead men to err; seeks to give the spirit opportunity for free outlook so that “the brotherhood of man” may cease to be only a phrase. Lodge visitation is a Masonic privflege which cannot be taken too seriously. Th~ eorrect re -"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"92 MIS CELLAN~EOO5 MISCELLANEOUS 93 ception of and warm cordiality toward a visitor not only adds to his pleasure but exihan~ his opinion of your Lodge in particular and Masonry In general. It is always good Masonic etiquette to go out of your way to make a visitor feel welcome and treat him as you would like to be treated If you were the visitor. And when you are visiting another Lodge, bear in mind that your failure to conform to the standards and usages of Masonic etiquette will reflect more unfavor - ably upon your Lodge than upon you. It is illegal to enter or leave the Lodge room during the ballot. It is discourteous to leave during a speech or lecture. The thoughful Mason will not leave during the conferring of a Degree except at those natural periods be - tween sections. The Worshipful Master In the East occupies the most exalted position in the gift of the Lodge. A Lodge which does not honor its Mis - ter, not because of what he himself may be, but because of the honor bestowed, is lacking in Masonic courtesy. The position he occupies, and not the man, must be given the utmost respect If the traditions of the Fraternity are to be correctly observed. Therefore, it is to the Mis - ter, not to John Smith, who happens to be In that Station, that you offer a salute when you enter or retire from the Lodge room, and on other occasions. The salute to the Master is your renewed pledge of fealty and service, your visible acknowledgement of your obliga - tion. It is performed before the Master and the Altar to show your respect for his authority and your veneration for the principles and pre - cepts expounded in the Book of the Law on which you were obligated. To offer your salute as though you were in a hurry, too lax to make it properly, or bored with the requirement that it be offered, is bad Masonic manners. The reception of and honors extended to a Grand Lodge officer should be conducted in a most felicItous manner. There was, no doubt, eonsiderable effort expended by the individual so honored in the attainment of his office and in the arrangement of personal affairs so that the meeting could be attended. Here again, proper respect is due him for his personal pre - ferment and attainment; the honors extended exhibit our fealty and allqianee to our Grand Lodge System. It is not intended to minutely detail here the manner in which the Mason should comport himself. But bear in mind that the public in general is not altogether unmindful of our codes and conventions; that more people than we re - alize anxiously await each opportunity to point out some deviation from our established stand - ard.; that all Masons wheresoever dispersed have one common goal: “Who oan best work and best agree.”"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"94 MISCELLANEOUS MISCELLANEOUS 95 EXAMINATION AND RECEPTION OF VISITORS Every possible courtesy should be shown the visitor prior to his admission as well as after - wards but it should be borne in mind that he has not as yet undergone the “due trial” or “strict eicamination” required by Masonic law. Many Jurisdictions require the visitor to pre - sent documentary evidence of his Masonic af - filiation and standing and It is well to request the visitor to exhibit any such written evidence, such as diploma, certificate of membership, re - ceipt for dues, ete. If the visitor has such a document his signature thereon should be com - pared with his signature to the visitor’s register. The Lodge is provided annually with a list of regular Lodges and the question of regularity of the visitor’s home Lodge should be verified. A committee, consisting of three Brethren, should be appointed to examine the visitor and. should the preliminary inspection of the docu - ments prove them satisfactory, the committee and visitor should retire to a convenient room where the committee should conduct such an examination as it deems proper, after having first administered the following Test Oath, on the Holy Bible: “I, A. B., do hereby and hereon solemnly and sincerely swear, that I have been regu - larly initiated, passed, and raised to the subhme degree of Master Mason, in a just and legally constituted Lodge of such; that I do not now stand suspended or ex - pelled, and know of no reason why I should not hold Masonic communication with my Brethren.” The visitor may request that this oath be repeated by each member of the committee, and may also ask to see the Charter. Either or both requests should be complied with un - hesitatingly. Now follows such examination as the commit - tee deems proper, according to the regular cate - chism or otherwise in the sound discretion of the committee It should be borne in mind that It is not the purpose of the examination to display the knowledge of the committee or of the visitor except for the purpose of determining, “Is the vIsitor a Master Mason, duly raised in a legal Lodge, and now in good standing?” The mem - bers of the committee should avoid “prompting” the visitor or expressing approval or disapproval of his replies. Visitors should be examined separately. If not satisfied that the Brother is what he claims to be, the committee should courteously inform him that, while no doubt is entertained concern - ing his statements as to his regularity (other - wise there would have been no examination), the committee does not feel that he has proven him - selt as required by the customs of the Fraternity. The committee should not indicate the grounds f or its conclusions to the visitor. After the committee is satisfied It will report If the committee is ready to report before the opening of the Lodge, the visitor may take a seat with the Brethren and be vouched for by the committee at the opening, and in due time be introduced. If the Lodge is open when the com - mittee is ready to report, the Tyler will an - nounce, The Committee with a visiting Brother,” when the Worshipful Master directs the Senior Deacon to introduce the visitor The Senior Deacon retires, is introduced to the visitor by the committee, then all return to the Lodge room and salute at the altar."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"96 MiscktLANi~oUS 97 MiSCELLANEOUs The Worshipful Master may call up the Lodge, and may say (in substance): “Brother - - , it gives me pleasure to introduce to you the officers and members of Lodge No. —~ , and our visit - ing Brethren, and to welcome you to a seat among us, We meet on and shall be glad to welcome you to any of our meetings.” The Senior Deacon conducts the visitor to a seat and the Lodge, if called up, is seated. No Brother should be allowed to visit a Lodge for the first time without an introduction. If the visitor is a Past Master, an officer of any Grand Lodge. or a permanent member of the Grand Lodge of the local Jurisdiction, he should be invited to a seat in the East. The Worshipful Master and all members should take great care to extend the proper courtesim to visiting brethren, and to make them feel that they are welcome.

He presides dur - ing the business as well as the work of Masonic labors of the Lodge. In all cases his derision on points of order is final in the Lodge, for it is a settled principle of Masonic law that no appeal can be taken to the Lodge from the decision of the Master. The Grand Lodge alone, or the Grand Master, for the time, can overrule his declared opinion on any point of order. The prerogatives of the Worshipful Master are 50 numerous, so varied, and so interwoven with each other that it is difficult to lay them out as so many threads from a tangled skein. For convenience we divide them into sections, and couple with them some of the more important duties that devolve upon him. His duties are plainly in harmony with his prerogatives, and it will seem almost a needless repetition, but the exercise of prerogatives and the discharge of duties should be properly understood FIRST PREROGATIVE. To congregate his Lodge upon any emergency. This function usually is performed by notifying the members through the public press, or by written or printed notices sent through the mail. To issue summonses, which must be issued over hia (the worshipful Master’s) written signature, or by his order, and attested by the written signature of the Sec - retary under seal of the Lodge, and such summons must be addressed to the Brother summoned, and must be either handed to him or sent through the post office to his last known address.

With - out his consent. escept at times for stated or regular commuincations. the Lodge cannot be convened or con - gregated. and any business transacted at a special corn - muincation without his sanction is illegal and void. FIRST DUTY. To attend regularly the communication of his Lodge This duty Is so plain as hardly to need a comment. Few things weaken and demoralize the Lodge so much as the Id aster’s frequent absence, and there are few SECOND PREROGATIVE To preside at all communi - cations of his Lodge. This is a self-evident proposition, and follows as a natural consequence of his installation There is this pecuiiarity attached to the Master of a Masonic Lodge: After being installed, he cannot resign, nor can he be deprived of his right to preside by sny power residing in the Lodge itself He is bound to psy homage to the Grand Master for the time being, and to the Grand Of - ficers when duly installed”, hence, when the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or other duly appointed repre - sentative of the Grand Master appears in the Lodge, the right of the Master to preside temporarily disappears. unless the superior authority waive the right. The Worshipful Master may, and sometimes will, call upon an experienced Brother or Past Master to preside. but he is all the time responsible to the Grand Lodge for the proceedings. as much so as though he held the gavel in person He may resume the East at any mo - ment, at his discretion In case of his absence or absenting himself after the opening of the Lodge, he must surrender charter, gavel, and prerogatives to the Senior warden, or close the Lodge PREROGATIVES AND DUTIES OF THE WORSHIPFUL MASTER things that more thoroughly lustify the Lodge us appeal - ing to the Grand Master to have him removed from office and his place tilled by the Senior Warden. The Master should be in the Lodge room at least half or quarter of an hour before the time for opening, to see that the Tyler is at his post and everything is in readiness for the proper conduct of the business Of the Lodge. If visitors are in attendance the worshipful Master is ready to meet them with the genial “word of welcome’ so acceptable to the stranger. SECOND DUTY To open his Lodge at the time speci - fled in the By-Laws and close it at a suitable hour. No clock is more punctually to sound forth the hour with its hammer than a well-disposed worshipful Master is to sound with his gavel the hour and moment of open - ing the Lodge After he has done this. if there Is not a sufficient number to open the Lodge. it is optional with him to wait for others or dismiss those ‘who are present There is nothing more discouraging than the tardiness of the Worshipful Master in opening the Lodge Carelessness and indifference on his part beget the same in the members He is the sole judge of the time to close the labors, but the Lodge should be closed at a proper hr,ur.

THIRD PREROGATIVE To select all appointive otH - cers and to fill temporarily all vacancies that may occur"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"110 NISCELLANEOUS tn the Lodge offices, unless otherwise provided by the Constitution and By -Laws, Every officer should be selected with special regard to his fitness for the position he is to occupy This is especially true of the Senior Deacon who is ihe proxy, the assistant, the executive of the worshipful Master as the Worshipful Master is the embodiment of the Lodge itself. Be is the active, forward personage in the drill and drama Bow important then that the Worshipful Master should make a cautious selection in this particu - lar case. As it is the duty of the Worshipful Master to “set the Craft to labor,” it is necessary that he have the active cooperation of all the officers and if any are ab - sent he has full power to select from the Brethren pres - ent such as he may deem competent to discharge the duties There is no advancement by right. If the Senior Warden Ia absent the Junior Warden does not ox-officio flu the West The Worshipful Master appoints a Senior Warden pro tem, THIRD DUTY.

To regulate the admission of visitors. One of the most important duties of the Worshipful Master is the preservation of harmony among the Brethren by the exercise of sleepless vigilance againsi the admission of cowans, or of those Brethren who, if admitted, would by their presence disturb the peace of the Lodge and hinder its work In the discharge of this duty the worshipful Master should exercise h”i pre - rogative and refuse the admission of any visitor whose presence would be objectionable to any member It would be a poor incentive to peace and harmony to admit a living cause of offense. FIFTH PREROGATIVE To control and terminate discussions. This right is not to be exercised in a haughty, arbi - trary, or dictatorial manner but with the determination to administer impartial Justice, to the end that the peace and harmony of he Lodge may be preserved and its prosperity secured This prerogative lb a landmark, essential to the position of the worshipful Master, the only method by which he can sustain himself in his responsibility to the Grand Lodge, and, happily for his position, one that will rarely bring him in conflict with his Brethren, while the good sersse of obedience incul - MISCELLANEOUS cated in every degree of Masonry will bend the minds of the Brethren to support the Worshipful Master in a judicious exercise of the power FIFTH DUTY To use his utmost endeavors to pre - serve peace and harmony in the Lodge. and by his de - portment, both in the Lodge and out of it. to be a good example to his Brethren The Masonic student will find nowhere a finer com - ment upon this passage than the well-known Charge at Installation of the Worshipful Master With slight changes. it reads’ “Impress upon the members of your Lodge the dignity and high importance of Masonry. Admonish them never to disgrace it, Charge them to practice out of the Lodge those duties which they havO been taught in it By amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct convince mankind of the goodness of the Insti - tution, so that when any one is said to be a Freemason the world may know that he is one to whom the Brotherhood may pour forth its sorrows, to whom dis - tress may prefer its suit, whose hand is guided by jus - tice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence” 8IXTH PRPROGATIVE AND DUTY To be the cus - todian of the Charter of the Lodge. and transmIt it to his successor. At his installation the Worshipful Master receives in charge the Charter of the Lodge Under its authority alone can the Lodge be organized: its presence is neces - sary to the legality of all meetings, and it follows that the powers of the Master can only be exercised under its sanction, It is therefore but Just that he should at all times be in possession of the evidence of his author - ity He should cerefully preserve it, and transmit it to his successor in office, SEVENTH PREROGATIVE To determine all queri - tions of order and the Order of Business. If a Master is competent to fill the station he occu - pies, he ought to be, and is, the best judge of what to do and when to do it His decisions should not be made in such a manner as to call forth criticism or Opposi - tion, but to secure the best results for the good of the Lodge, He should remember that the “good of Masonry in his Lodge’~ is in his keeping, and that he alone is responsible to the Grand Lodge for the good order, peace and harmony of his Brethren. SEVENTH DUTY, To perform the ritualistic work of the Lodge and lnatrllct the Brethren therein. The Masonic drama presents a beauty and sublimity calculated to arouse a desire for excellence in every intelligent mind, Nothing outside the Holy Scriptures is so grand, solemn, and sublime as the dramatic lessons which make up the theory of a Freemason’s life. ‘1’o"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"112 MISCELLANEOUS each ceremony there is a sequence that explains the preceding and hints at the subsequent passage In each symbol is a practical thought that binds together In perfect harmony, and each points to higher attainments in the present life as a trust for a place in the world of bliss to come Each suggests. in some degree, that kind - ness to our fellowmen is a means of pleaaing God, and that pleasing Film is the highest source of human hap - piness Is not the place of hierophant of such mysteries a desirable one?

To refuse to initiate a candidate, notwithstanding his acceptance by the Lodge, if in his judgment, such inItia - tion would be improper. To Order a second ballot when the first is unfavorable —he taking care that the necesary precautions be ob - served and that the re-balloting be done before any Brother partIcipating in the first ballot has left the Lodge room, To discuss all questions wIthout regard to the par - liamentary etiquette of leaving the chair, hecaisse it is his duty at all times to give the Craft good and whole - some instruction. To be exempt from trial by his Lodge. The Grand Lodge alone has penal jurisdictIon over him THE DUTIES OF WARDENS AND OTHER OFFICERS With Excerpts from “Masonic Jurisprudence” THE WARDENS The duties of the Senior Warden are, in the absence of the Master, to presIde, and govern the Lodge in his presence, to assIst him in the government of it. In the absence of the Master, the SenIor Warden gov - erns the Lodge. This Is his inherent right, He may, and often does, as a matter of courtesy, realgis the chair to some Past Master present, but such Past Master always acts under the authority of the Warden, who has first to congregate the Lodge, that Is to call the Breth - ren to labor, before he resigns the gavel of his authority into the hands of the Past Master, All the dutIes that devolve upon the Senior Warden, in the absence of the Master, devolve in lIke manner, and precIsely to the same extent, upon the Junior War - den, in the absence of both the Master and the Senior Warden. But if the Master be present. and the Senior Warden absent, the Junior Warden does not assume the functions of the latter officer, but retains his own sta - tIon, and a Senior Warden pro tempore must be ap - pointed by the Master, In assistIng the Master in the government of the Lodge, it is the duty of both officers to see that due silence is observed around their respective statIOns, and that the orders issued from the East are strictly obeyed. THE TREASURER The duties of the Treasurer are to receive all monies from the Secretary, to keep an accurate account of the same, and to pay them out by Order of the Worshipful Master, with the consent of the Lodge. As the banker simply of the Lodge, he has nothing to do with the collections, which should be made by the Secretary, and handed over to him. These funds he re - tains in his hands, and disburses them by the order of the Lodge, which must be certified to him by the Mas - ter. His accounts should be neatly and accurately kept, and be always ready for the inspection of the Lodge or of the Master. THE SECRNTARY The duties of the Secretary are to observe the pro - ceedings of the Lodge; to keep a fair record of all things proper to be written; to receIve all monies due the Lodge and to pay them over to the Treasurer, tak - ing his receipt for the same. The Secretary acts, in his relation to the Lodge, in a threefold capacity He is its recording, corresponding, and collecting agent As the recordIng agent of the Lodge, it is his duty to keep a minute of all the proceedings, except such as are of an esoteric nature, and whIch the peculiar constI - tutIon of 6ur society forbIds him to commit to paper. It is also his duty, whenever called upon, to furnish the Grand Lodge or the Grand Master with a fair transcript of any portion of his records that may be requIred As the recording agent, he is also expected to furnish, at every communIcation of the Lodge, a statement of the unfinIshed busIness which is to be called up for action. As the correspondIng agent of the Lodge, he receives and reads all communications which have been addressed to the Lodge, and replies to them, under the dIrectIon of the Lodge or the Master, whenever action has been taken upon them. He also issues notifications and sum - monses for special or stated communications This duty. particularly In reference to the stated communications, is sometimes Improperly neglected. Every Mason is en - titled to notification, either verbal or written, for every meeting of his Lodge The Secretary is also the proper officer to make out the returns to the Grand Lodge, an~ to communicate to it, through the Grand Secretary, no - tices of rejections, suspensions, and expulsions He is, in fact, the organ of communication between hIs Lodge and the Grand Lodge, as well as all other Masonic bodies. As the collecting agent of the Lodge, he keeps the accounts between itself and the members, receives all"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"116 MISCELLANROU~ dues, and all fees for initiation, passing, and raising; and alter making an entry of the sums and the occa - sions on which they were paid, he transfers the money forthwith to the Treasurer, and takes his receipt. The books and accounts of the Secretary, like those of the Treasurer, should be examined at least once a year by a committee appointed by the Lodge. and they should be at all times ready for the Inspection of tbe Master, THE DEACOIgS The dutIes of the Senior Deacon are to attend at the altar, to attend to all alarms at the inner door, to pre - pare, receive, and conduct candidates; to welcome, In- traduce, and accommodate visiting Brethren; and Ic carry orders from the Worshipful Master in the East to the Senior Warden in the West, and elsewhere, that the business of the Craft may he expedited thereby. He also takes charge of the ballot box in all ballots. places it on the altar in the customary form, and after all the members have voted, exhIbits it for Inspection tO the Junior and Senior Wardens, and Master, in rotation, The Junior Deacon is the especial attendant of the Senior Warden; and his duties are to see that the Lodge Is duly tiled; to attend to all alarms at the Out5r door, and to carry messages from the Senior Warden in the West to the Junior Warden in the South, and else - where about the Lodge as he may direct. THE STEWARDS The Stewards are to assist the Senior Deacon in the preparation, reception, and conduct of candidates, also. in the introduction and accommodatIon, when neceesafy, of visItors, Webb adds to these the further duties of seeIng “that the tables are properly furnished at refreshment, and that every Brother is suitably provided for.” and he makes them the assistants generally of the Deacons and other offIcers in performing their respective duties. TEl TYLER The first and most important duty of the Tyler is SO guard the door of the Lodge. and to permit no one to paas in who is not qualified, and who has not the per - mission of the Master Of these quatifications, In doubtful cases, he is not himself to judge, but on the approach of any one who is unknown to him, he should apprise the Lodge by the usual formal method As the door is peculIarly under his charge, he should never for MISCELLANEOUS 117 an instant be absent from his post He should neither .,pen the door himself from without, nor permit ii to bc opened by the Junioi Deacon from within, without the preliminary alarm A necessary qualification of a Tyler Is, that hs should be a Master Mason Although the Lodge may be Opened in an inferior degree, no one who has not ad - vanced to the third degree can legally diacharge the functions of Tyler, THE CHAPLAIN It is the special duty of the Chaplain to conduct ths devotions of the Lodge, and to present before the throne of Heavenly Grace the spiritual necds of the Brethren. THE MARSHAL It is the duty of the Marshal to organize the Lodge, to form and conduct all processions, and attend to such other duties, as the Worshipful Master may direct THE LANDMARKS LANDMARK PIRST The Modes of Recognition are, of all the Landmarks, the most legitimate and unquestioned They admit of no variation, and If ever they have suffered alteration or addItion, the evil at such a violation of the ancIent law has always made Itself subsequently manifest. An admission of this is to be found in the proceedings of the late Masonic Congiess at Paris, where a proposition was presented to render these modes of recognition once more universal—a propositIon which never would have been necessary, if the integrity of this important Land - mark had been rIgorously preserved. LANDMARK SECOND The Division of Symbolic Masonry into Three Degrees is a Landmark that has been better preserved than almost any other, although even here the mischievous spirIt of innovation has left its traces, and by the dis - ruption of iti concluding portion from the third degree. a want of uniformity l’as been crested in respect to the final teaching of the Master’s order, and the Royal &rch of England, Scotland, Ireland and America, and the “high degrees” of France and Germany, are all made to differ in the mode in whIch they lead the neophyte to the great consummation of all Symbolic Masonry In 1813, The Grand Lodge of England vindicated the ancient Landmark, by solemnly enacting that Ancient Craft Ma - sonry consisted of the three degrees of Entered Appren - tice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason, including the Holy Royal Arch, Bul the disruption has never been"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"MISCELLANEOUS 119 118 MISCELLANEOUS healed, and the Landmark, although acknowledged in its IntegrIty by all, still continues to be violated. LANDMARK THIRD The legend of the Third Degree is an important Landmark, the integrity of which has been well pre - served. There is no rite of Masonry practiced in any country or language, in which the essential elements of this legend are not taught The lectures may vary, and indeed are constantly changing, but the legend has ever remained substantially the same And it is necessary that it should he so, for the legend of the Temple Builder constitutes the very essence and identity of Masonry Any rite which should exclude it or materi - ally alter it. would at once, by that exclusion or alter - ation, cease to be a Masonic rite LANDMARR FOURTH The Government of the Fraternity, by a presiding offIcer called a Grand Master, who is elected from the body of the Craft, is a fourth Landmark of the Order. Many persons ignorantly suppose that the election of the Grand Master is held, in consequence of a law or regu - lation of the Grand Lodge Such, however, is not the case The office i 5 indebted for its existence to a Land - mark of the Order Grand Masters are to he found in the records of the Institution long before Grand Lodges were estahilahed, and if the present syatem of legislative government by Grand Lodges were to he abolished, a Grand Master would still be necessary. In fact, al - though there has been a period within the records of this history, and indeed of very recent date, when a Grand Lodge was unknown, there never has been a time when the Craft did not have theIr Grand Master LANDMARK FIFTH The Prerogative of the Grand Master to Preside Over every assembly of the Craft, wheresoever and whenso - ever held, is a fifth Landmark It is in consequence of this law, derived from ancient usage, and not from any special enactment, that the Grand Master assumes the chair, or as it is called in England. “the throne,” at every communication of the Grand Lodge. and that he Is also entitled to preside at the communication Of every Subordinate Lodge, where he may happen to be present LANDMARK SIXTH The Prerogative of the Grand Master to Grant Dispen - sations for conferring degrees at irregular times, Is an- other and very Important Landmark The statutory law of Masonry requires a month, or other determinate pe - riod, to elapse between the presentation of a petition and the election of a candidate But the Grand Master has the power to set aside or diapense with this pre - bation, and to allow a candidate to be initiated at once This prerogative he possessed in common with all Mas - ters. before the enactment of the law requiring a pro - bation, and as no statute can impair his prerogative, he still retains the power, although the Masters of Lodges no longer possess it. LANDMARK SEVENTH The Prerogative of the Grand Master to GIve Dispen - satione for opening and holding Lodges is another Land - mark He may grant, in virtue of this, to a sufficient number of Masons, the privilege of meeting together and conferring degrees The Lodges thus establishd are called “Lodges under Dispensation “ They are strictly creatures of the Grand Master, created by his authority, existing only during his will and pleasure, and liable at any moment to be dissolved at his command They may be continued for a day, a month, or sIx months, hut whatever he the period of theIr exIstence, they are indebted for that existence solely to the grace of the Grand Master. LANDMARK EIGHTH The Prerogative of the Grand Master to Make Masons at Sight. is a Landmark which is closely connected with the preceding one There has been much misapprehen - sion in relation to this Landmark, which misapprehen - sion has sometimes led to a denial of its existence In jurisdictions where the Grand Master was perhaps at the very time substantially exercising the prerogative, with - out the slightest remark or opposition. It is not to be supposed that the Grand Master can retire with a profane into a private room, and there. without assistance, confer the degrees of Preemasonry upon him. No such prerogative exists, and yet many be - lieve that this is the so much talked of rIght of “making Masons at sight.” The real mode and the only mode ol exercising the prerogative is this The Grand Master summons to his assistance not less than six other Ma - sons, convenes a Lodge, and without any previous pro - bation, hut on sight of the candidate, confers the de - grees upon him, after which he dissolves the Lodge. and dismisses the Brethren Lodges thus convened for spe - cial purposes are called ‘Occasional Lodges ‘ This is the only way In which any Grand Master within the records of the institution has ever been known to “make a Mason at sight” The prerogative is dependent upon that of granting dIspensat~ons to open and hold Lodges If the Grand Master has the power of granting to any other Mason the privilege of presiding over Lodges workIng by his dispensation, he may assume this privilege of presiding to himself, and as no one can deny his right to revoke his dispensation granted to a number of Breth - ren at a distance, and to dissolve the Lodge at his plea - sure, It will scarcely be contended that he may not re -"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"120 MIS CELLANEOUS MISCELLANEOUS yoke his dispensation for a Lodge over which he himself has been presiding, within a day, and dissolve the Lodge as soon as the business for which he had assembled it is accomplished The making of Masons at sight is only the conferring of the Degrees by the Grand Master, at once, in an Occasional Lodge. constituted by his dis - pensing power for the purpose, and over which he pre - sides in person. LANDMARK NINTH The Necessity for Masons to Congregate in Lodges is another Landmark. It Is not to be understood by this that any ancient Landmark has directed that permanent organization of Subordinate Lodges which constitutes one of the features of the Masonic system as it now pre - vails But the Landmarks of the Order always prescribed that Masons should fiom time to time congregate to - gether, for the purpose of either operative or speculative labor, sod that these congregations should he called Lodges Formerly these were extemporary meetings called together for special purposes and then dissolved. the Brethren departing to meet again at other times and other places, according to the necessity of circumstances But warrants of constitutiOn, by-laws, permanent offi - cers and annual arrears, are modern innovations wholly outside of the Landmarks, and dependent entirely on the special enactments of a comparatively recent period LANDMARK TENTH The Government of the Craft, when so congregated in a Lodge by a Master and two Wardens. Ia also a Land - mark. To show the influence of this ancient law, it may be observed by the way, that a congregation of MaaOnS meeting together under any other government, as that for Instance, of a president and vice-president, or a chairman and sub~chairm5n, would not be recognized as a Lodge The presence of a Master and two Wardens Is as essential to the valid organization of a Lodge as a warrant of constitution is at the present day The names, of course, vary in different languages, the Mas - ter, for instance, being called “Venerable” in Prench Masonry, and the Wardens “Surveillants,” but the off I- cars, their number, prerogatives and duties, are every - where identical. LANDMARK ELEVENTH The Necessity that Every Lodge, Wben congregated, Should Be Duly Tiled, is an important Landmark of the institutIon, which is never neglected The necessity of this law arises fiom the esoteric character of Masonry As a secret institution, its portals must, of course, be guarded from the intrusion of the profane, and such a law must. therefore, always have been in force from the very beginning of the Order It is, therefore, properly classed among the most ancient Landmarks The office of Tyler is wholly independent of any special enactment of Grand or Subordinate Lodges, although these may and do piescribe for him additional duties, which vary in different jurisictions But the duty of guarding the door, and keeping of f cowans and eavesdroppers, is an ancient one, which constitutes a Landmark for his gov - ernment LANDMARK TWELE’rH The Right of Every Mason to be Represented in all general meetings of the Craft and to instruct hia repre - sentatives, is a twelfth Landmark Formerly, these general meetings, which were usually held once a year, were called “General Assemblies,” and all the Frater - nity, even to the youngest Entered Apprentice, were per - mitted to be present Now they are called “Grand Lodges” and only the Masters and Wardens of the Sub - ordinate Lodges are summoned But this is simply as the representatives of their members Originally, each Mason represented himself, now he is represented by his officers This was a concession granted by the Fraternity about 1711, and of course does not affect the integrity of the Landmark. for the principle of representation is still preserved The concession was only made for purposes of convenience LANDMARK THIRTEENT II The Right of Every Mason to Appeal from the decision of his Brethren in Lodge convened. to the Grand Lodge or General Assembly of Masons, is a Landmark highly essential to the preservation of justice. and the preven - tion of oppression A few modern Grand Lodges, in adopting a regulation that the decision of Subordinate Lodges, in cases of explusion, cannot he wholly set aside upon ~n appeal, have violated this unquestioned Land - mark, as well as the principles of just government LANDMARK FOURTEENTH The Right of Every Mason to Visit and sit in every regular Lodge is an unquestionable Landmark of the Order This is called “the right of visitation “ This right of visitation has always been recognized as an in - herent right, which inures to every Mason as he travels through the world And this is because Lodges are justly considered as only divisions for convenience of the uni - versal Mayo-sic family. The right may, of course, be impaired or forfeited on special occasions by various circumstances, but when admission is refused to a Mason in good standing, who knocks at the door of a Lodge as a visitor, It is to be expected that some good"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"122 MISCELLANEOUS and sufficient reason shall be furnished for this viola - tion of what Is in general a Masonic right, founded on the Landmarks of the Order. LANDMARK FIFTEENTH It is a Landmark of the Order that no Visitor Un - known to the Brethren Present, or to some one of them as a Mason, can enter a Lodge without first passing an examination according to ancient usage Of cons se. if the visitor is known to any Brother present to be a Mason in good standing, and if that Brother will vouch or his qualifications, the examination may he dis - pensed with as the Landmark refers only to the cases of strangers, who are not to be recognized unless after strict trial, due examination, or lawful InformatIon LANDMARK SIXTEENTH No Lodge Can Interfere in the Business of Another Lodge. nor give degrees to Brethren who are members of other Lodges This is undoubtedly an ancient Land - mark, founded on the great principles of courtesy and Praternal kindness, which are at the very foundation of our institution It has been repeatedly recognized by subsequent statutory enactments of all Grand Lodges LANDMARK SEVENTEENTH It is a Landmark that Every Freemason is Amenable to the Laws and Regulations of the Masonic Jurisdic - tion in which he resides, and this although he may not be a member of any Lodge Non-affiliation, which is, in fact, in itself a Masonic offense, does not except S Mason from Masonic jurisdiction LANDMARK EIGHTEENTH Certain qualIfications of Candidates for Initiation are derived from a Landmark of the Order These qualifica - tions are that he shall be a man—shall be unmutilated, free born, and of mature age That is to say, a woman, a cripple, or a slave, or one born In slavery, is dis - qualified for initiation into the rights of Masonry Stat - utes, it is true, have from time to time been enacted. enforcing or explaining these principles; but the qualifi - cations really arise from the very nature of the Ma - sonic institution and from its symbolic teachings, and have always existed as Landmarks LANDMARK NINETEENTH A Belief in the Existence of God as the Grand Ar - chitect of the Universe, is one of the most Important Landmarks of the Order It has been always deemed essential that a denial of the existence of a Supreme and SuperIntending Power, is an absolute disqualifica - tion for initIation The annals of the Order never yet MISCELLANEOUS 123 have furnished or could furnish an instance in which an avowed atheist was ever made a Mason The very Ini - tiatory ceremonies of the first degree forbid and prevent the possibility of so monstrous an occurrence LANDMARK TWENTINrE Subsidiary to this belief in God, as a Landmark of the Order, is the BelIef in a Resurrection to a Future Life This Landmark is not so positively impressed on lbs candidate by exact words as the preceding; but the doctrine is taught by very plain implication, and runs ibrough the whole symbolism of the Order To belIeve in Masonry, and not to believe in a resurrection, would be an absurd anomaly, which could only he excused by the reflection, that he who thus confounded his belief and his skepticism, was so ignorant of the meaning of both theories as to have no rational foundatIon for his knowledge of either LANDMARK TWENTY-FIRST It is a Landmark, ihat a “Book of the Law” shall constitute an indispensable part of the furniture of every Lodge I say advisedly, a Book of the Law, be - cause it is not absolutely lequired that everywhere the Old and New Testaments shall be used The “Book of the Law” is that volume which, by the religion of the country, is believed to contain the revealed will of the Grand Architect of the Universe Hence, in all Lodges in Christian countries, the Book of the Law is composed of the Old and New Testaments. in a country where Judaism was the prevailing faith, the Old Testament alone would be sufficient, and in Mohammedan coun - tries, and among Mohammedan Masons, the Koran might be substiluted Masonry does not attempt to interfere with the peculiar religious faith of its discIples, except so far as it relates to the belief in the Existence of God, and what necessarily results from that belief The Book of the Law is to the speculative Mason his spirit - ual Trestle-Board, without this he cannot labor, what - ever he believes to be the revealed will of the Grand Architect constitutes for him this spiritual Trestle-Board, and must ever be before him in his hours of specula - tive labor, to be the rule and guide of his conduct The Landmark, therefore, requires that a Book of the Law, a religious cods of some kind purporting to he an ex - emplar of the revealed will of God, shall form an 55- sential part of the furniture of every Lodge LANDMARK TWENTY-SECOND The Equality of all Masons is another Landmark of the Order Thia equality has on reference to any sub - version of those gradations of rank which have been instituted by the usages of society The monarch, the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"124 MiSCELLANEOUS 125 MISCELLANEOUS nobleman or the gentleman is entitled to all the in - fluence, sod receives all lbs respect which rightly belongs to his exalted positlon But the docirine of Masonic equality implies that, as children of one great Father, we meet in lbs Lodge upon the level—ihat on that level we are all traveling to one predestined goal— that In the Lodge genuine mesit shall receive more respect than boundless wealth, and that virtue and knowledge alone should be the basis of all Masonic honors, and be rewarded with preferment When the labors of the Lodge are over and the Brethren have retired from their peaceful retreat, to mingle once more with the world, each will then again assume that social position, and exercise the privileges of that rank, to which customs of society entitle him. LANDMARK TWENTY-THIRD The Secrecy of the Institution is another and most important Landmark There is some difficulty in pre - cisely definlng what is meant by a “secret society If the term refers, as perhaps, in strictly logical lan - gisage It should, to those associations whose designs are concealed from the public eye, and whose members are unknown, which produce their results in darkness, and whose operations are carefully hIdden from the public gaze—a definItion which will be appropriate to many political clubs and revolutionary combinations in des - potic countries, where reform, if It is at all to he ef - fected must be effected by stealth—then clearly Freema - sonry is not a secret society Its design is not only publIcly proclaimed, but is vaunted by Its discIples as something to be venerated—its disciples are isnown. for its membership is considered an honor to be coveted—It works for a result of which it boasts—the civilization and refinement of man, the amelioration of his condI - tion, and the reformation of his manners But if by a secret society is meant—and this is the most populaf understanding of the term— a society in which there is a certain amount of knowledge, whether it be of methods of recognition, or of legendary and traditional learning, which is imparted to those only who have passed through an established form of initiation, the form itself being aiso concealed or esoteric, then in this sense is Freema - sonry undoubtedly a secret society Now thIs form Of secrecy is a form inherent in it, existing with it from Its very foundation, and secured to it by its ancient Landmarks. If divested of its secret character, is would lose his identity and would cease to he Freemasonry. Whatever objections may, therefore, be made to the institution on account of its secrecy, and however much some unskilled Brethren have bean willing In times of trial, for the sake of expediency, to divest it of its secret character, it will be ever impossible to do so, even were the Landmark not standing be~Ore us as Sn unsurmountable obstacle: because such change of its I I character would be social suicide, and the death of the Order would follow its legalized exposure Freemasonry. as a secret association, has lived unchanged for centuries —as an open society it would not last for as many years LANDMARK TWENTT-FOURTH The Foundation of a Speculative Science upon an Operative Art, and the symbolic use and explanation Of the terms of that art, for purposes of religious or moral teaching, constitute another Landmark of the Order. The Temple of Solomon was the cradle of the institu - tion, and, therefore, the reference to the operative Ma - sonry, which constructed that magnificent edifice, to the macerials and implements which were employed in Its construction, and to the artists who were engaged In the building, are all component and essential parts of the body of Freemasonry, which could not he subtracted from it without an entire destruction of the whole iden - tity of the Order. Hence, all the comparatively modern rites of Masonry, however they may differ In Other re - spects, religiously preserve this temple hIstory and these operative elements, as the substratum of all their modi - fications of the Masonic system. LANDMARK TWENTT-FIFrH The last and crowning Landmark of all is, that These Landmarks can Never be Changed Nothing can be sub - tracted from them—nothing can he added to them—not the alightest modification can be made in them As they were received from our piedecessors, we are bound by ihe most solemn obligations of duty to transmit them to our successors Not one Jot or one tittle of these un - written laws can be repealed, for in respect to them, we are not only willing, but compelled to adopt the lan - guage of the sturdy old barons of Bngland—”NolumiSs leges mucari ALBERT G.

CONCERNING GOD AND RELIGION A Mason is obligated, by his tenure, to obey the moral law, and if he rightly understands the art, he will never be a stupid atheist, nor an Irreligious libertine But though In ancient times Masons were charged In every counlry to be of the religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, yet tis now thought more expedient only to obligate them 10 that religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves, that is, to be good men and true, or men of honour and honesty, by whatever denominations or persuasions they may be distinguished, whereby Masonry becomes the center of union, and the means of conciliating true lriendship among persons that must have remained at a perpetual distance. II. OP THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE, SUPREME AND SUBORDINATE A Mason Is a peaceable subject to the civil powers, wherever he resides or works, and is never to he con - cerned in plots and conspiracies against the peace and welfare of the natIon, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior magistrates, for as Masonry hath been al - ways injured by war, bloodshed and confusion, so an - cient kings and princes have heen much disposed to en - courage the Craftsmen, because of their peaceableness and loyalty, whereby they practically answered the cay- lie of theIr adversaries, and promoted the honour of the Fraternity, who ever flourished in times of peace. So that if a Brother should he a rebel against the state, he is not to he countenanced in his rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man, and if convicted of no Other crime, though the loyal Biotherhood must and ought to disown his rebellion, and give no umbrage or ground of political jealousy to the government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his relation to It remains indefeasible, m. op LODGEE A Lodge I. a place where Masons assemble and work, hence that assembly, or duly organized society of Masons, is called a Lodge, and every Brother ought to belong to one and to be subject to its By-Laws and the General Regulalions It is either particular or general, and will be best understood by attending it and by the regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annexed In ancient times, no Master or Fellow could he absent from It, especially when warned to appear at It, without incurring a severe censure, until It appeared to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hindered him The persons admitted members of a Lodge must be good and true men, free born, and of mature and dis - creet age, no boodmen, no women, no immoral or scan - dalous men, but of good report [V.

There Is an overwhelming emphasis in this solemn silence; and as we follow our friends to the brink of the grave, and stand seemingly on the shores of a vast ocean, we feel our own feet slide from the bank on which we stand; and are gently reminded that we, too, must pass this way. Let us resolve to seek the favor of the eternal God, so that when the moment of passing comes, even as it has to our Brother, we may be enabled to prosecute our journey without dread or appre - hension, to that far-distant land from whose bourne no traveler returns. To the relatives and friends of our Brother, we have but little of this world’s consolation to offer; we can only, sincerely, deeply, and most affection - ately sympathize with them, and assure them that Re, who looks with infinite compassion upon the afflicted, will fold the arms of His love and pro - tection around those who put their trust in Him. CEREMONIAL 215 The Lambskin, or White Leathern Apron, is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason. It reminds us of that purity of life and conduct so essentially necessary to gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides (The Master deposits apron on the coffin and, displaying an evergreen sprig, continues.) The evergreen is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. By this we are reminded that we have an immortal spark within, which shall survive, and springing into newness of life in realms beyond the skies, shall never, never die. (The Master drops the evergreen on the coff in.) Worshipful Master: Earth to earth (Senior Warden, with trowel, scatters earth in the grave); dust to dust (more earth scattered); ashes to ashes (more earth scattered); there to remain until the dawn of that resplendent day, when again the morning stars shall sing together and all the sons of God shall shout for joy “To him who sees, who understands, How mighty Masonry appears, A Brotherhood of many lands, A fellowship of many years, A Brotherhood so great, so Vast, Of all the Craft of all the past And so I say, a sacred trust Is ours to share, is ours to keep I hear the voice of men of dust, I hear the step of men asleep, And down the endless future, too, Your own shall echo after you” ANY SUITABLE PRAYER MAY BE USED or Master or Chaplain: Almighty and most merci - I"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"I,.

The Officers will take their proper positions and after the Deacons have formed an arch with their rods over the Master, and the Stewards have formed an arch with their rode over the Senior Warden, the Master will proceed with the Service) Worshipful Master: One by one they pass away—the Brothers of our adoption, the com - panions of our choice. A Brother whose hands we have clasped In the bonds of Fraternal fel - lowehip now lies before us In the rigid embrace of death. All that remains of one near and dear to our Fraternity is passing from our sight, and we know that we shall meet him on earth no more. We who knew him so well in our Brotherhood, feel that in his passing from among the living, something has gone out of our own lives that can never be again. Thus, as human ties are broken, the world becomes less and less, and the hope to be reunited with friends who are gone, grows more and more. Here is Immediate com - pensation, which, while it cannot assuage our grief, may teach resignation to the inevitable doom of all things mortal. While we stand around the open grave, in the presence of a body, once, and so lately, warm with life and animate with thought, now linger - ing for a brie! moment at the dark portal of the tomb—like a beam of holy light the belief must come: This cannot be all there is of a day! Stricken human nature cries out: There must be a dawn beyond this darkness and a never-setting sun, while this short life is but a morning star. The cycles of time roll with the procession of seasons. Spring is bloom; summer is growth; autumn is fruition; winter is the shroud, and beneath Its cold, yet kindly fold, live the germs of a new life. Spring comes again; growth inn - tures, and fruit is eternal. This is the religion r CEREMONIAL and lesson of nature, and the universal example cannot fail in relation to man. Let us draw comfort and consolation from things visible in this sad scene, and lift our eyes to the Invisible Father above with renewed confidence that we, too, axe in His holy hands. Besides His infini - tude of worlds, we have his Word, “that He is all, and all-upholding.” We can do nothing for the dead. We can only offer respect to our Brother’s inanimate clay, and cherIsh his memory in the abiding faith that our temporary loss is his eternal gain. In this belief let us commIt him with due reverence to the keeping of the Almighty, who is supreme in wisdom, infinite in love, and ordereth all things well. It is an ancient and honorable custom of the Order of Free and Accepted Masons to perform the rites of burial over the remains of a depart - ed Brother. In the character of Masons we are now assembled and address ourselves to that solemn duty. And while we pay this tribute of respect and love to the memory of our departed Brother, let us not forget to extend our Fraternal sympathy to his deeply afflicted and sorrowing family (or relatives) in their bereavement. As he, for whom we are all mourners, was true to us and faithful to the ties of Brotherhood, so shall we be true to them in the practice of the principles of Free - masonry and in tender memory of our loved and lost. We owe a grateful acknowledgment to them for his social companionship and service, and mingle our sorrows with theirs, his near and dear relations. Farewell, Brother (Name in full), until we meet you and greet you on that ever-shining shore, to be parted never more, forever and forever.

The lambskin or white leathern apron is an em - blem of Innocence and the badge of a Mason; more honorable than the crown of royalty or the emblazoned insignia of princely orders, when worthily worn. (Deposits apron on coffin.) Our Brother was worthy of its distinction, and in the grave it shall bear witness of his virtues and our confidence In the sincerity of lila profession. (The Master, displaying an evergreen sprig, con - tinues.) The evergreen is emblematical of our Faith In the Immortality of the Soul. This green sprig in the symbol of that spark of our being which continues to grow more divinely when the breath leaves the body, and can never, never die. (The Master drope the evergreen on the casket and the Brethren remain in place They should march around the grave in an orderly line It would be weil to have a Brother familiar with the ceremony to lead the line in passing the coffin.) Worshipful Master: Change is the universal law of mortality and the theme of every page of its history. Here we view the most striking Illus - tration of change that can come to mortal eyes, minds, and hearts. Ties of Fraternity, love, all broken; earthly pursuits, hopes and affections laid waste by death. Let us profit by thin exam - ple of the uncertainty of the world and resolve to live pure, worshipful and upright lives in daily preparation for the summons that will sooner or later, surely come. It came to our Brother whom remains we have here laid to eternal rest, and reminds us that we too, are mortal—subject to the universal law. Our Brother is dead and can - not speak for himself. Let us defend lila good name. Frailties he may have had, as what mor - tal man has not. To err is human, charity in Divine, and judgment is with the Almighty and All-Merciful. In this resting place of the body, CEREMONIAL 221 virtues only are remembered, and sweet memories bloom. All must pass through the dark valley of the shadow of Death, and each must make the jour - ney alone. Let us all hasten to secure the pass - port of an upright life, to the glories of a better land. Unto the grave we have resigned the body of our Brother. Earth to earth (Senior Warden scatters earth In the grave, with trowel); dust to dust (more earth scattered); ashes to ashes (more earth scattered); there to remain until the dawn of that resplendent day, when again the morning atars shall sing together and all the sons of Clod shall shout for joy. (PRAYER) Master or Chaplain: Thou, 0 God, knowest our down-sitting and our uprising, and under - standest our thoughts afar off. Shield and de - fend us from the evil intentions of our enemies, and support us under the trials and afflictions we are destined to endure, while traveling through this vale of tears. Man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with Thee; Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; turn from him that he may rest, till he shall accomplish his day. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
