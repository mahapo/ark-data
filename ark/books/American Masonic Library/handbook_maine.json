[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I wish to thank the many people who have helped me in the preparation of this manual. Some sections such as the section on \"How To Get Mew Members Involved\" are mine alone. Other sections were taken wholly from others such as the letter to the new Masons wife which was written by Bro. Alan J. Morgan. All such items were extensively adapted for Maine and for our usage most particularly a series of items written by Bro. Thomas Ard of the Grand Lodge of California. I thank Bros. Walter Macdougall, Brian Paradis and Norris Dwyer for their suggestions which greatly improved this Handbook. And finally, I thank my secretary, Karen Schiegel, who is becoming quite knowledgeable about Masonry in Maine. INTRODUCTION This Handbook is part of a project of the Committee on Masonic Education and Lodge Services to make available to the Craft both new materials and materials which have been published in the past but which have become dated. \"HIRAM'S HANDBOOK\" is a companion to 'HIRAM DRUMMOND'S TRESTLEBOARD\". The Trestleboard is a planning guide for Senior Wardens preparing for their year in the East. This Handbook is tool especially designed for the Master who wants to be an inspiring leader and an efficient manager. Because each Lodge is different and each Master unique, the material presented is not intended as a template to be imposed on your administration, but as suggestions for consideration and adaptation. Study and reflect upon it. Share it with your officers. Keep it handy in your briefcase. CONTENTS HOW YOU AS MASTER CAN...

The words from the installation ceremony still ring in your ears. You have been told that the honor, reputation and usefulness of your Lodge depend in your ability to manage its concerns. Are you prepared? In future years, will your picture hanging in the anteroom call to mind the work of a leader or the memory of an ncompetent caretaker? You have this one opportunity to leave an example for others to follow. The choice is yours. Keep in mind that your Lodge is not governed by a textbook: only the Master ossesses such authority and that~person is you. Make each moment count and everyone around you a success. This is your year. How will it be remembered? MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER Organizations, large and small, government and private, fraternal and corporate, successfully operate only by paying strict attention to the needs, aspirations and concerns of people. Successful organizations, either fraternal or private, can trace their success directly to the amount of concern that they exhibit for the people they serve. When was the last time you returned to a restaurant that provided poor service, or served you a substandard meal for the high price you paid? When did you return to a store that exhibited a lack of concern for your business or sold you an inferior product? The same holds true for your Lodge. The amount of attention you pay to \"customer service\" for your membership, their families and the community will dictate the success or failure of your term. * Are your refreshments and meals well prepared, attractive and served promptly? * Is your Lodge clean and orderly and reflective of the beauty which our ritual dictates? * Is every Brother and his family greeted in a manner which reflects the brotherly love of our fraternity? * Are you and your Lodge fulfilling the needs and aspirations of every member? If the answer is no, then you are not providing that important \"Customer Service\" aspect of every successful organization - You are now the proprietor of a long established business. Think for a moment - what services can you and your Lodge provide to attract present and future customers back into your store? We often forget that people make organizations. It is not the required paperwork, the beautiful ritual, the fancy organizational charts, or elaborate trestle boards. The management principles in this chapter will assist you in administering your Lodge by properly managing people. AUTHORITY vs. LEADERSHIP There is only one Master bIT a Lodge, only one authority and only one leader. The Constitution and regulations of the Grand Lodge of Maine expressly delegate full authority to the Master to govern the Lodge in accordance with those laws. In plain terms, my"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Brother, you are the boss, the leader and the manager. BUT WAIT! Our Constitution and Regulations, our customs and usages create a tension is our leadership structure. By Masonic law and custom we grant the Presiding Master unusual authority and great deference. The wise Master does not let that go to his head. He knows that he cannot use his gavel arbitrarily, but must constantly work to inspire and encourage his team, to unite them in a common goal, and to help them achieve that goal. Leadership exists in every Lodge. In some cases the leadership is exercised by the Master. In other cases, regrettably, leadership is not exercised, and the Master stands back allowing others, such as Past Masters or Secretaries, to wield an unseen gavel. In successful Lodges the Master takes charge. In unsuccessful Lodges the vacuum is filled by others. How will it be during your year? Will you be in charge or will you sit regally in the East, wield a hollow gavel and allow others to assume the legitimate authority you have abandoned? The emblem of power is in your hands. Wield it with discretion, courtesy and above all, brotherly love. Never forget that the opportunity to lead the Brethren of your Lodge and to manage its affairs has been given to you. How well you take advantage of this opportunity will determine the success or failure of your year in the East. There is no excuse for allowing a leadership vacuum to occur. THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU Harry S. Truman, Past Grand Master of Missouri, proudly displayed a sign on his desk in the Oval Office which succinctly described the term Responsibility. It read 'THE BUCK STOPS HERE\". That world-famous sign, in symbolic form, is forever displayed to all the brethren, silently resting upon the Master's podium, in front of the Oriental Chair. You cannot escape it; it cannot be thrown away; it cannot be destroyed, or placed into another Brother's hands. No matter how hard you may try to avoid it, \"THE BUCK STOPS HERE\" is that proverbial shadow which will never fade away. It is yours and your alone. Everyone will take credit for increased membership, excellent ritual, a beautiful Lodge and good participation by the membership at all functions. Few will share responsibility for failure. You, as Master, will not be able to escape the responsibility for what occurs during your year. The Brethren know this. They long to hear a Master say: \"I wish to thank the brethren for the confidence they have reposed in me. The authority of the Oriental Chair is now in my hands for this Masonic year. I assume tptal responsibility for the leadership and management of this Lodge. I will give credit to everyone for the things that go w~ll, and I will carry the burden of blame for that which does not go well. My Brethren, I lCnow that, 'THE BUCK STOPS HERE'.\" BUILDING YOUR TEAM ~ to set the craft at work with proper instruction. How many times have you heard this essential duty of the Master proclaimed at the opening and closing of each meeting? They are not just empty words"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"required by ritual. They describe a leadership function essential to the success of your Lodge. No man can accomplish every task that is required to build a vibrant and progressive Lodge. Team Building is the process in which you, as Master, assemble, mold and direct a group of participants to labor on differing tasks toward a common and well defined goal. Your Lodge officers and membership are your team. Many are at home on inactive reserve status. Some are the \"active reserves\" sitting on the sidelines waiting and wanting to become involved. Others are the officers, your \"first string\", who are in the trenches on a daily basis. The successful team utilizes each category of participant to the fullest extent. The unsuccessful team, no matter how skilled the quarterback, neglects the full roster and thereby suffers the consequences. Review your team, list the jobs that are required and personally ask your members to complete just one assignment. Then set them \"work with proper instructions\" and let them pursue their labors. Each player, every sideliner and even your inactive reserve must be thoroughly educated in what needs to be accomplished (crossing the goal line); how it is going to be accomplished (the play); and who is going to do the work (who blocks and carries the ball). For the play to be successful, eacitof the participants must know the goal, provide input on how to achieve the goal and know the duties and responsibilities of each team member. As the quarterback, you may be scoring a multitude of touchdowns, but never forget the example of Joe Montana. Symbolically take your linemen to dinner and show your appreciation for their efforts. Their picture may never appear on the cover of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED but they will be pleased with your success and be ever ready to contribute more. HOW TO DELEGATE Delegation of authority and responsibility to accomplish limited tasks is the management principle which assures that all tasks, large and small, are accomplished according to plan. As Master of the Lodge, you must utilize, to the fullest extent, the manpower resources that are available to you: the inactive reserve, the sideliners and the first string. \"Ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you\" is that perfect timeless pirase that best describes the principle of Delegation. Ask a Brother to do a task; give him the necessary authority and resources to carry out his mission, make him responsible for its success and check with him frequently to insure that he is on the proper track. If he is proceeding according to plan, leave him alone. If he is not accomplishing the task, provide him with some assistance or find another person to carry the ball. Here are some essential elements to remember when you delegate authority and responsibility to complete a task: A. You can delegate authority but, you, as Master, are responsible for the final product. You can't point the finger and say \"but I asked him to do it\". The brethren on the sidelines will simply shake their heads. They know who is responsible and who didn't tend to detail. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"B. KISS \"keep it short and simple\" - Explain in simple terms what needs to be done. You might offer some helpful ideas, but respect their ability do the job. People resent being given a task and then being told exactly how to do it. Very soon they think, \"If he wants to do this his way, he can do it\". C. Discuss the project with those assigned to determine what manpower, materials and money are required to adequately complete the task. Each assignment requires resources. Some jobs cannot be completed without adequate tools. So make an agreement; provide the proper tools and set them to work. D. Set realistic time limits for each phase of the assignment. You can't expect major duties to be completed yesterday and you cannot allow the job to extend indefinitely. Remember that work expands to fill the available time. So be reasonable, yet firm, with the amount of time you allocate to a specific assignment. Human nature requires deadlines. Otherwise procrastination will leave you with last minute difficulties and possibly failure. B. Check back often with those who have been delegated the task to ascertain their progress and/or problems that have been encountered. If you wait until the last day, you risk being caught short without enough time to complete the job properly. F. Give public praise and recognition to all who have successfully completed their assignments, no matter how small the task. Everyone likes to be recognized for his contributions. Those who have received suitable recognition will soon volunteer again, and those who witnessed the praise being given will want a piece of the action. Remember, honey, not vinegar, will attract the worker bees. FOLLOW UP As Master of your Lodge you will develop goals and objectives, formulate plans for their execution and delegate to others. However, controlling these efforts is mandatory to insure successful completion. Your delegated staff is like an unbridled team of horses pulling a wagon loaded with valuable cargo. If the entire project is left only to those pulling the wagon, your cargo (goals) may arrive at a different destination, at a later date or it may have never left the barn and the horses are still standing there eating their oats. Every project requires a leader (the Master) to handle the reins, to spur them on, to turn them either left or right and to stop them when necessary. The Master must continually make a determination as to whether the horses are strong enough and in sufficient numbers to pull the required weight. Additionally, when trouble arises, he must know when to dismount, put his shoulder to the wheel and help push the cart over a steep hill. Every project requires the leader to expend his prestige and authority, when necessary, to keep the cart on path and on time. The reins are in your hands. Use them only when necessary. If your project has had trouble getting started or is wandering off track, gently take up the slack and guide them back on the road. Never jerk harshly or use your whip, for your team may become frustrated and stop in their tracks. Issuing proper instruction at the beginning and regularly following up by either personal contact or by telephone is usually all that is required to control your team and to determine if you have the right horses and that they are strong enough for the load. TRAINING YOUR OFFICERS"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" \"Yesterday I couldn't even spell Worshipful Master and today I are one.\" This simple statement, regrettably illustrates the dilemma in which many Lodges find themselves when the elected leadership either neglects or fails to expose and train the junior officers in the duties and responsibilities that are required when they arrive in the East. Masonry attracts \"I good men from all levels of society, \"The high and the low, the rich and the poor On one hand, the different backgrounds of our membership provide a rich mixture of diverse experiences and opinions. On the other hand, very few, without prior training and orientation, possess the knowledge and experience to be successful in the Oriental Chair. By starkly facing the critical reality that few of us are initially qualified to be Master, we must take the opportunity to begin the long process of preparation, training and orientation required to prepare our officers for leadership. \"I feel like a mushroom! Kept in the dark and fed fertilizer\". This common attitude, which may prevail among your junior officers, is one which you must understand, attack and eliminate. The bottom line is that each Lodge and every member must appreciate the fact that, when entering the line of succession, there is no single person within this jurisdiction who is fully prepared to assume the Oriental Chair. A good Master trains his junior officers in both leadership and ritual. The often repeated phrase \"when you finally learn the job, your year as Master is finished\" must be eliminated from usage. The benefits of such training to you and your Lodge are substantial. As in any profession those properly trained perform their tasks at an increased level of competence, resulting in Lodge improvement and member satisfaction. Additionally, seeing help and proper training being given may induce some sideliners to make the transition from the sidelines to the chairs. Who is responsible? The Grand Lodge is not responsible. Neither is it the responsibility of your District Deputy or the Past Masters . Each Master is fully, totally and completely responsible for insuring that each officer is fully prepared to competently assume the duties and responsibilities of the succeeding chair prior to installation. In simple terms, you do not have the luxury of \"spring training\". You and your officers must be in mid-season form from the moment the first ball is thrown. The following are some helpful hints when instituting an officers' training program: A. Prepare and distribute the descriptions of the duties and responsibilities of each position to each officer. Set deadlines for each officer to be proficient in the skills required. B. Hold frequent officers' meetings and communicate the methods and rationale behind all your decisions and actions and request their input. C. Utilize a \"Big Brother\" or \"Mentor\" approach by delegating to each officer the responsibility of training next year's officer the duties of his position. D. Require each officer, committee chairman, the Treasurer and the Secretary to explain the function of his position and the manner in which he executes his responsibilities. E. Allow each junior officer to actually perform the duties of the next chair when qualified."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"F. Obtain, distribute and discuss the many instructional materials available through the Grand Lodge and use your officers to attend the training classes held by both the Leadership Academy and the Masonic Education Committee. G. Organize a visit to the Grand Lodge office for your officers and members. If within a reasonable distance spend the day not only to view the beautiful temple but to learn of the extensive resources that are available to you, your officers and the Lodge. If you come from a great distance use your time at the Annual Communications for this educational experience. The staff is friendly, courteous and ever willing to assist you in every manner possible. H. Prepare your officers for the next position not only in ritual, but in the other responsibilities at least by July. I. Communicate your officers training program to the membership. A member who may otherwise be reluctant to assume a leadership position may step forward because he now realizes that a program to improve his skills is available and that he is not alone as he assumes greater responsibilities. Always remember those important principles that we have previously discussed. Plan, organize, communicate, delegate and control are vital when implementing a staff training program. MAKE YOUR LODGE KNOWN \"Masons make themselves known by certain... Internally, we do a pretty good job on signs of recognition, lapel pins, rings, etc. However, we do not do a good job making ourselves known within the communities where we live. During our better years, in the 1940's and 1950's, it was easy. Most civic, professional and business leaders were members of the fraternity. Regrettably, this is no longer the case. We must make a solid and concerted effort to expose our principles and beliefs to the communities in which we live. No one will do it for us. Each community is umque and therefore different strategies are required. There is simply no excuse for sequestering ourselves in our temples while the community swirls around us. One of your goals is to improve public awareness of your Lodge and of the Masonic fratermty. The objectives you can develop to reach that goal are limited only by your imagination. Pick up and read your community calendar and decide how you and your Lodge can be a vital part of these planned activities. Your only limitation is soliciting the public for funds for your internal use. Information booths at festivals, participation in parades, attendance at local churches, community groups and service clubs is appropriate. Every time you go out, invite others to come in, as guests or program speakers. These are but a flew examples of thousands of ideas. Your primary task is to get that team thinking and working on a program to increase our public awareness. MANAGING YOUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET: YOUR TIME You now have that top hat firmly in place, the gavel in hand and stand ready to govern the lodge during your Masonic year. 365 days, 8760 hours and 585,600 minutes are available for your use. Your committees are in place, the program is set and the officers and members stand ready to assist in building the lodge. The question remains, \"How can I possibly accomplish all that needs to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"be done in the short time frame of one year?\" Time, your most valuable resource, can either be squandered, without hope of recovery, or efficiently managed and put to effective use. Absent the time required to accomplish mandated Masonic tasks, i.e., stated meeting, degrees, funerals, etc., you have full control of your time. You must realize that each hour wasted is one less hour you have to accomplish your goals. Each hour effectively utilized is one further step towards improving your Lodge. The choice is yours. How will you manage your most valuable resource? A. Be Master of Your Own Schedule You must first realize that it is your time you are spending and you can be either its boss, or you can allow it to boss you. Your year can be either a rewarding experience, or it can become an exhausting ordeal. The difference is in the manner in which you manage your time. The following are some helpful hints that will assist you in changing your time use habits and achieving your goals for the year. B. Time Savers Each of us have valuable commitments to our family and employer that must be satisfied prior to scheduling time for the Lodge. To take full advantage of every hour, it is mandatory that you evaluate your work habits and eliminate those activities which are unproductive and waste your valuable time. Eliminate time wasters and utilize the following to increase your productivity. 1. Schedule a portion of each day strictly to conduct the business of the Lodge. That scheduled hour will accomplish more than many hours grabbed at random. 2. Station yourself in a quiet place and do not take any telephone calls, receive visitors or allow yourself to be otherwise interrupted. Ask mother to keep the kids quiet, answer the telephone and take messages. Protect your time. 3. Inform your officers and members of your schedule so that they will not be annoyed when told that you are now busy and will get to them at another time. Additionally, they will cooperate in reducing the potential for interruptions during your work period. 4. Schedule yourself the previous day by writing down important tasks, in order of priority, on a THINGS TO DO TODAY pad that can be purchased at any stationery store. During your scheduled time, begin on #1 and stay with it until you are completed. Recheck your priorities and then begin on #2. Make this your habit every working day and you will find that things get done and you will still have extra time for other important tasks. 5. All your telephone calls should be short, to the point and strictly business. Use other time to socialize on the telephone. Your schedule dictates only work for this period. 6. Don't put off until tqmorrow what you can do today. Those who procrastinate habitually become interruption prone. Take a difficult task, set priorities, time limits and focus on the problem until it is resolved. 7. Don't be a perfectionist: If you wait until you are absolutely sure of everything you will never get anything done. 8. Learn to say no. You cannot accomplish everything for everybody. Many activities are in the \"nice to do, but not essential\" category. Do not"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"spend time on efforts that are not included in your goals. It is much easier to just say NO than to waste time on unproductive endeavors. 9. BE decisive! Delaying a decision or talking an issue to death will not result in a solution. Face up to a problem, make your decision and move on to another issue. Don't waste time because of a reluctance to take on a decision. 10. An \"I'll 'do it myself' attitude will result in you spending your time on nonessential tasks that can be done perfectly well by others. Decide what is important for you to accomplish and what should be delegated to others. As Master, don't waste time on minor matters. There will not be enough left for what is important. 11. Make appointments and keep them. Don't allow unscheduled meetings to occur at times when you should be socializing with the brethren. Those times are for relaxation and fellowship, not business. If cornered, simply acknowledge that the Brother has an important concern and schedule a time to get together for either a meeting or simply a telephone call. This will make him feel important, and you have not wasted time that should be devoted to others. 12. Constantly evaluate your use of time. Most time management experts strongly recommend that you keep a simple log of your activities so that you can evaluate exactly how your time is being utilized and then make the necessary adjustments to increase productivity. Your present habits must give way to your new responsibilities otherwise you will never find quality time to properly complete your required tasks. Our ritual eloquently speaks of the importance of managing time. \"Whereby we find eight hours for service to GOD and a distressed worthy Brother, eight hours for our usual vocations and eight hours for refreshment and rest\". This is instruction given to your newest candidate. You should also follow that example by allocating your time for the benefit of your Lodge and your brethren. You can make your job exceedingly difficult and time consuming or you can make it seem like \"a piece of cake\". The difference between the two is in the manner in which you manage your time. SECTION 2 HOW TO ESTABLISH YOUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES No organization, either fraternal or private, can be successful, in the long term, without establishing well defined goals and objectives from which to direct the membership. Successful goals are those which are conceived with the participation of the membership and executed with their support. Human nature dictates that a person will strive to achieve a goal if it is well defined, understood and accepted. He will not, however, endeavor to work if he has no idea what the ultimate purpose of his labors are. A Lodge without defined and accepted goals is a Lodge without committed and enthusiastic members. Establishing goals for your Lodge is a group process which should involve your entire roster. Naturally, some, principally your officers, are more important and should be brought into the process early for their participation, ideas and ultimate support. Others, the sideliners and inactive reserve, should be advised of the results of your labors and their input requested. Thus everyone is aware of the existing problems and the manner in which they are going to be resolved. WhaX we are going to do, when it is going to be done and how it is going to be"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"accomplished. Start the process of establishing goals for your Lodge by following this simple group process: A. Assemble your officers and perhaps a few interested sideliners in a suitable meeting place, one that offers relaxation and comfort. Obtain and utilize a large \"flip\" chart and a handful of colored marking pens. Also provide some suitable refreshments to keep the assembled brethren contented. B. With one man assigned to the chart, begin by asking each man individually - What in your view is the biggest problem existing within our Lodge? Allowing each participant to list only one response, go around the room and solicit an answer from every individual. Continue around the room numerous times until all perceived problems are listed. Remember that every man is different and each has an individual view on what the real problems truly are. Every response must be respected. To ridicule someone's view will effectively remove him from the process and insure his ultimate opposition. C. Once all the problems are listed, then the group should review the work accomplished and begin to list them in priority. Once completed, you now have a listing of the perceived problems within your Lodge. Some problems will be minor and can be easily resolved by an immediate decision. Others will be major and require extensive plans and work to be achieved. D. The solutions to these listed problems should be the foundation for the ultimate goals which the leadership of your Lodge should establish. Allow your group to renew the problems and establish a few achievable goals, both short term and long term. Then communicate your goals and plans of action to the membership for their input and ultimate acceptance. B. Stay on track, continue communicating your goals, and announce all progress and/or problems that you have encountered. What have you just accomplished? Think for a moment. You have begun team building, communicated through a group process, outlined what needs to be accomplished and achieved a \"buy in\" from both the present and future leadership and the membership. Everyone now knows, in writing, what direction that you and the future Masters of your Lodge are travelling. Additionally, they are aware of what is going to be required of them to accomplish the tasks at hand. The following is just one example of setting proper goals and objectives for your Lodge. During your meetings, you and your team have concluded that the financial base for your Lodge has been eroded over the past few years and the team has determined that something must be done to correct this deficiency. Therefore, as a group, you have set the following as a goal: Increase the Financial Resources of the Lodge by $10,000 within three years. Objective A. Review present spending to insure that all funds are now being utilized efficiently. Objective B. Review the historical pattern of spending and saving to ascertain how you arrived at your present levels. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Objective C. Review all sources of income into your Lodge - dues, donations, rentals, dinners, social events, candidate fees, etc., each as a percentage of total income. Objective E. Determine what present spending can be reduced to assist in achieving the goal. Objective F. Determine what fees can be raised and to what levels to achieve the goal. Objective C. Communicate the findings of your team to the membership through the trestle board, special newsletters and at all meetings. Objective H. Develop a plan of action with specific time frames for implementation of all fee increases and/or spending decreases that will meet the goal that your team has set. Objective I. Bring the goals and objectives before the Lodge for full discussion and approval by a vote of the membership. The work of your team is now an official goal of the Lodge, fully approved, and awaiting implementation. Objective J. Continually review the plan of action and update it as the need arises to make sure that you and the future leaders are meeting the established goals of your Lodge. The above is only an example of many such goals and objectives which your Lodge may wish to adopt. The important lesson to be learned is that your Lodge and its membership require specific direction if they are to be concerned and active. Don't hesitate: Wade on in: the water's fine. PLANNING: THE KEY TO YOUR SUCCESS The magnificent Temple that was constructed by King Solomon was not accomplished without detailed and concise plans which outlined all the tasks that were required, when they were to be constructed and who was to do the work. Proper planning leads to concise execution and results in superior performance and ultimately user satisfaction. It is mandatory that you need to establish an overall extensive plan for your year that includes separate detailed plans for each of your term's activities and programs. The planning process may be thought by some to be unnecessary and a waste of time. However, it is a short sighted view which, in many cases, will result in a severe decline in the quality of \"customer service\" provided within a Lodge. There are all sorts of plans: some are short term which may relate to a program for a specific evening, and others are long term which may extend over a period of years. The important issue for you to be concerned with is that you and your Lodge have specific plans for every activity and every improvement that is desired, both short and long term. Team building and establishing goals and objectives as outlined above are the beginning of the planmng process. You now have the officers and the Lodge communicating with one another for the purpose of improving your Lodge. Now you must begin the process of preparing plans for implementation. Prior to embarking upon any task, you first must know where you are. Then and only then can you plan which roads you must take and which vehicle you must ride to get you to your desired destination. It is easy to meet,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"discuss problems and then establish some goals and objectives. The hard part is to actively put them into effect. You can talk all day about the trip you are going to take. The difficulty comes when you must decide where to go how to go and low much it is going to cost you. The results of the \"problem sharing\" and \"goal setting\" meetings that you have held with your officers and members is the point of departure for the planning process. IRECTION Direction is more than setting your goals and objectives or developing extensive plans. Direction combines the above with specific guidance on completing assigned tasks or overseeing the work. Taking into consideration our present society and the fact that a Lodge is an assembly of volunteers, care must be given in the manner in which direction is given. It is easy to bark orders in an authoritarian manner. However, little will be accomplished because your membership will soon return to their homes and find something else entertaining to do. Additionally the absence of direction will create a leadership vacuum and absolutely nothing will be accomplished. Each task within a Lodge requires proper direction if the job is to be completed according to plan. When assigning a task to a member tell him in polite terms what you wish accomplished. Request his input, decide what path to take and strike an agreement as to what is going to be done. If a disagreement arises regarding the process, praise him for his ideas but then inform him of the manner in which you would like the task to be completed. Use words such as \"That is a great idea but if you don't mind I would really like it done this way\". In every instance when giving direction, think about the best way to approach a Brother and ultimately obtain his support. Common courtesy and good manners is the \"honey that attracts those worker bees\". Direction can also come through a detailed explanation of what the requirements are for each job within a Lodge. Did you give your officers and Committee chairmen a job description of their duties and responsibilities? Verbal descriptions often times are insufficient to provide adequate direction. Call a meeting with your team and completely review each task within the Lodge and assign it to an individual. Section 6 of this Handbook have excellent examples of job descriptions for your officers and committees. Use them where appropriate or change them to reflect the traditions of your Lodge, but above all, commit the routine and required duties of each officer and committee member to writing. Finally, distribute the materials to those involved and make sure that they understand what is required of them. SECTION 3 HOW TO ORGANIZE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF YOUR LODGE Every organization needs an adequate flow of funds to support its goals and objectives. Has your Lodge kept pace with the financial demands and expectations of modern life and inflation? Is it a comfortable location for the leaders of our communities to congregate and socialize? Are your social events adequately funded to insure the quality that separates the Masonic fraternity from other social organizations? Unfortunately, the answer to these important questions, in a great many Lodges, is NO. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Take a long hard look at yourself, your Lodge and your goals and objectives. Can you accomplish all the items on your priority list of goals and objectives with present resources alone? Probably not. If this is true, now is the time for action. To delay establishing a firm financial foundation only makes the situation worse and creates a larger problem for those in succeeding years. You may be thinking, \"I don't want to be known as the Master who raised dues\" or \"We can get by forthis year, but YOU will certainly have to do something about it next year\". If this is the situation in your Lodge, determine that YOU will be part of the solution and not part of the problem. A positive approach towards establishing a firm financial base will yield a positive result. Be proud of the fact that you and your officers saw the problem, studied the alternatives, established financial goals and moved towards a solution. Masons by nature are generous and accommodating. If given the facts, and a plan for action, they will respond in a positive manner. There will always be those who complain about the slightest increase in any fee. If you do your homework well, they will be silenced by the broad support you have enlisted from your officers and members. To establish the Lodge on a path of financial stability is a badge of honor you should wear proudly. \"You can lead them to water, but you can't make them drink\" is an expression that is appropriate in this instance. Your job is to lead the members of your lodge to water. If you don't, who else will? Once at the well, explain the importance of the water. If they are smart, and most of them are, they will soon dip in and enjoy it. If they are not, they will soon know the alternative. At least, you had the courage and foresight to lead them in the right direction. A. THE NEED FOR A BUDGET One of the least understood and most feared principles of management is preparing a budget. Think of a budget as your road map for planning the programs and activities of your Lodge for the entire year. As Master, you can forget about the easy financial devices available in your personal budget. A Lodge budget does not include charge accounts, credit cards or overdraft capabilities. Although all your transactions may be in the form of checks, the principle is very simple: cash money in and cash money out. You can only spend what you have earned. That is a budget. Preparing a budget for your Lodge is a simple process. Whether or not a budget already exists in a Lodge is of no consequence. The budget process must start from scratch each year if you are to be effective in properly administering the funds of your Lodge. It starts, not with a review of the Lodge's finances, but with goals and objectives. 1. THE BUDGET AND FINANCE COMMITTEE A budget that is to be submitted for approval by the membership must be much more than just a document prepared by the Master for his specific year. To achieve wide spread support by the Brethren for your spending plan, it is necessary that you involve an appropriate number of respected and knowledgeable members to ensure that you consider all the various concerns of the Lodge. An active Budget and Finance Committee, which involves your Officers and selected members will be able to provide you with additional"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"valuable input and information upon which to make valid budget decisions that will be accepted and supported by the membership. 2. INVOLVING THE MEMBERSHIP Once the document has been adjusted to reflect your revenue, spending and savings, publish it in your trestleboard to inform the membership. At your first Stated Meeting, distribute additional copies to all those attending and conduct a complete discussion. If questions arise, address them forthrightly and honestly. When your budget is approved by the Lodge, it now becomes their spending plan, not yours. The bottom line is that everyone has had the opportunity to discuss the plan and they fully realize the resources required for implementation. The rest is up to them. B. HOW TO STAY WITHIN YOUR BUDGET It is vital to the integrity of your budget to monitor your expenditures to insure that your spending is within the authorized budget. If you can add, subtract and say \"NO\" you can effectively control the Lodge's budget. At the start of your year, ask both the Secretary and Treasurer to submit to you, prior to each Stated Meeting, a year-to-date statement of the total amount of revenue received and a list, by budget categories, of all expenditures. When compared to the approved budget, you now have a picture of your fiscal condition. If you are in the red, you must then say \"NO\" to further spending. If you are in the black, then you can continue to implement your spending plan. Simple as that. 1. PLAN AHEAD Be extremely careful not to become elated if you find that you have early fiscal year budget surpluses. Be aware that what may appear to be excess revenue at the beginning of the year is due to receiving dues income early and not making major expenditures until later. Plan ahead and follow your system of traditional expenditures so that you may remain fiscally solvent for the entire year. 2. HANDLING UNEXPECTED EXPENSES It never fails to happen that, during each fiscal year, there will be some new unanticipated expenditure that appears vital to your Lodge and cannot be delayed until next fiscal year. When this occurs, and it will, be extremely careful to insure that the expenditure is in accord with both your spending plan and the wishes of the membership of the Lodge. The first order of business is to assemble your Budget and Finance committee and review the existing appropriations and expenditures to prepare a recommendation to the membership. If the new expenditure can be accommodated by utilizing excess revenue from either under-expended accounts or increased revenue sources, then present the recommendation to the membership with a request for a budget category adjustment. 3. BUDGET HMITS Each budget category, by necessity, must have limits. Some adjustments can be made in categories that are under-expended to make up those areas which are deficient, due to unexpected expenses or unforseen circumstances. Be careful to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"insure that your limits are reasonable and monitored carefully. 4. AUTHORIZED EXPENDITURES Insure that your budget plan and expenditures conform to both the requirements of the Grand Lodge and the budget which has been approved by your membership. Each Master must insure that the Lodge expends only that which is authorized. Review the Constitution of the Grand Lodge of Maine, its Standing Regulations, and the By-laws of your own Lodge to insure that the expenditures are consistent with both the letter and intent of the law. C. DUES AND DUES COLLECTION Now that you have just finished deciding how to spend your Lodges' money, you had better determine how much your dues are going to be and how you are going to collect it. monitored and available revenues considered, then you must be forthright and communicate with your membership. Otherwise you could experience serious problems and possible defeat. Continually make your case at Stated Meetings and in your trestleboard. Inform them about the financial situation within the Lodge and enlist their support. You will get some complaining, but with accurate information that is widely distributed, the membership will understand and respond. As you are aware, a dues increase requires an amendment to the By-laws of your Lodge and the approval of the Grand Master. Notify the membership in writing of your intent before the By-laws can be changed. Make this a personal message from you to each member of the Lodge. c. The Lodge Officers Enlist the aid and support of your Lodge Officers in this important venture, especially those in line. If your officers are supportive of your endeavor and are willing and able to assist you with the membership, it would be very difficult for the Brethren to discount the impact of a united unit of Lodge Officers. D. DETERMINING THE INITIATION FEE The initiation fee for the privilege of becoming a Mason has, for the past many years, been a grossly neglected source bf revenue for most Lodges. Many Lodges maintain initiation fees without regard to either the true worth of membership or the actual costs that are incurred in presenting the degrees and administratively supporting the new member. Some real important questions you should ask yourself are as follows: 1. How long has our initiation fee been at its present level? 2. What should it presently be, considering the impact of inflation since the last revision? 3. What is the actual cost of presenting the degree, i.e., Lodge use (heat), presentations, apron, candidate education materials, etc.? 4. How can an increase in fees assist in balancing our budget or increasing the quality of programs and services?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 5. What will the market reasonably bear? Often times, we forget that what is received cheaply is not respected. Review your fees and if an increase is appropriate, prepare to change the By- laws of your Lodge to reflect both the increase in delivery cost and the true worth of Masonic membership. 1. DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF DUES The amount of dues depends entirely upon the membership and the level of expenditures you need to make. A wealthy Lodge, of which there are some, may not require a large amount of dues to support its program because its revenues are ample for its needs. The majority of Lodges do not have large financial resources, and dues income is the single largest revenue category. In such cases, when dues are low, the program and services provided to the membership reflect the dues status. To determine appropriate dues, consider the following: The first step is to take your plan of activities and your building costs and compare it with the financial resources that are necessary for implementation. The budget simplifies your plan for those activities which you foresee during your year in the Oriental Chair. It is nothing more and nothing less. Assemble your Budget and Finance Committee and have them review each category of income and expenditures. Everyone must understand how the money comes in, how it goes out and what is left for savings. Now it is important to superimpose your goals for this and future years. The next question is simple to ask, but hard to answer. Can we pay for it and how? If there are sufficient funds, no problem. If there are not sufficient funds, then you are left with only four alternatives: 1. Eliminate or reduce the scope of the plan. 2. Reduce expenditures in another existing category. 3. Raise additional funds to cover additional costs. 4. A combination of the above. The initial choice is now up to you and your team. What financial plan do you prepare and take before your Lodge? It doesn't take an experienced budget manager to conclude, for example, that even a goal of increasing membership by 10 applications per year will result in increased expenditures. This is due to increased Lodge occupancy (heat), additional aprons, trestleboards, etc, etc. There is no such thing as a free lunch. Your budget therefore must be adjusted to compensate for your planned activities and programs either by reduced expenditures or an increase in revenues. After the team has placed a firm dollar figure behind each budget category to reflect your goals for the year, you must now direct your attention to the revenue expenditure \"How do we now pay for our lunch?\" The anticipated revenue should exceed your expenditures by a minimum of 10 - 15%. The excess is necessary to provide both an emergency reserve and a hedge against inflation. To break even, in the long term, is to lose money. Your dues must be adjusted to pay for your program. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2. WAYS TO COLLECT DELINOUENT DUES Delinquent dues is a continuing problem for each Lodge Master and certainly the Secretary, whose responsibility it is to \"collect all money from the Brethren\". To reduce the problem of delinquent dues, consider the following: a. Be certain that each Brother is notified, in a timely manner, of his annual dues responsibility. Be sure that statements are sent to each member's residence not later than November of each year. You cannot depend upon the Brethren to remember to pay their dues. Most individuals pay their bills monthly. Give them a bill, and the vast majority of the Brethren will promptly pay. b. Each Lodge needs a Delinquent Dues Committee to review quarterly the dues income, list those who have not yet paid and to notify the Secretary that the required delinquent notices must be sent to those in arrears. Don't be bashful about notifying a delinquent member. Many have just forgotten or overlooked the responsibility. Make sure that the letter is a simple reminder, not abrupt or harsh. c. Before notifying a delinquent Brother of the possibility of suspension, be sure to make personal contact with him to insure that some problem doesn't exist. The required suspension notice can be very upsetting to an individual, so be especially careful to insure personal contact prior to suspension. 3. A DUES INCREASE - HOW TO SELL IT Dues are, in most Lodges, the single most important source of operating revenue. It is important to establish, as high priority, a program to increase dues, if necessary and justified. The following are some suggestions to assist you in that important task. a. The Budget and Finance Committee Make sure that the Budget and Finance Committee is composed of individuals who are respected within the Lodge as Brethren of integrity and responsibility. It is their report and recommendations that will be submitted to the membership for ratification. If the Brethren believe that the committee is faithfully observing the best interests of the Lodge, then the proposal will obtain fair consideration. b. Communication With the Membership Inform your membership of the financial situation within the Lodge. If a dues increase is necessary, and all categories of expenditures have been carefully E. INVESTMENTS AND MAXIMIZING YOUR INCOME You have an obligation to your Lodge and its membership to insure that the dollars collected are earning maximum return for the benefit of the Lodge. Too often, Lodges will place their funds into what is convenient and easy, instead of where their funds can earn income. The Budget and Finance Committee should review with the Treasurer how the Lodge funds are invested and what is the rate of return. Some simple hints are as follows: "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1. In the checking account, keep only such funds as are necessary to pay the monthly obligations. Insure that you are receiving the highest interest on your checking account available within your community. 2. Retain in a liquid savings account enough to fund unanticipated emergency expenses. 3. Invest the remaining funds in accounts that provide the highest reasonable return in the safest possible manner. SECTION 4 HOW TO PREPARE YOUR LODGE BUDGET A budget should be used in every Masonic Lodge. You may not have thought about it, but everyone makes use of budgets in one way or another. This is true in every aspect of life, whether it be conserving energy for use in the final minutes of a game, or reducing automobile speed to stretch-out the remaining gasoline supply until you can reach a gas station. Budgeting is necessary to attain your desired goals and to keep your planning within the realm of reality. It requires a systematic evaluation of estimated income and expenditures to ensure that funding will be available for programs, activities and building maintenance. A. RESOURCES The first step in creating a budget is to estimate the income that the Lodge will receive. All budgets must eventually relate to the resources or income available. These resources are determined by the size of your Lodge's membership, amount of investment yield, and other sources. It is not, however, the most important aspect of the budgeting process, as we shall see later. These Lodge resources are typically made up of one or more of the following: 1) Dues 2) Interest and Dividends 3) Sale of Stocks or Bonds 4) Income from rental property 5) Applications and Affiliations 6) Donations 7) Other Consult with your Secretary and Treasurer to learn how much money is available in the several accounts held by the Lodge, and to determine the amount of the annual income which may be expected from each account. Funds available to your Lodge may be estimated by filling out the budget form shown in Appendix D. B. FIXED COSTS OR NON-DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES The second element is to determine the costs associated with your Lodge, and without which it cannot function. These are the fixed costs, and should be itemized separately from non-fixed or discretionary expenses. Fixed costs should include the following: 1) Rent/Maintenance"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2) Utilities 3) Salaries and associated taxes 4) Trestleboard printing and postage 5) Telephone 6) Per-Capita tax This list is presented as a suggested guide for planning. Actual fixed cost items can only be determined by considering your Lodge's unique situation. C. NON-FIXED EXPENDITURES OR PROGRAM BUDGET Once the resources and fixed expenses are identified and cataloged, the real task of budgeting can begin. After all revenues are identified, and the totals compared, you will have a good idea of the amount of money available for your special programs or your program budget. This is the point where dreams become realities as your ideas for the Lodge start to take shape in the form of realistic programs. D. PROJEUlI' AND PROGRAM CHOICES When you have determined what your budget allows, you will have to make some project or program choices. Projects and programs can be very expensive or very inexpensive. It all depends upon what you plan and how you execute it. The costs of various projects and programs must be carefully estimated if you are to come up with a realistic budget. The following items should be considered in your estimates: 1) Printing costs (special trestleboard inserts, flyers, programs, tickets, etc.) 2) Postage for flyers and/or tickets 3) Entertainment costs (Musicians, entertainers, scenery and misc. for home or local talent, etc.) 4) Decoration costs 5) Food or refreshments (include condiments, paper goods, etc.) You may not have all the details for each of your programs worked out to the level shown above; but the closer that you can come, the better your estimate will be. E. MATCHING PROGRAM COSTS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES As soon as you have determined what your budget allows, and how much your proposed projects and programs cost, you will have to make the hard decision as to which programs you can afford, and which you will have to drop. Benefits of possible programs are not easily evaluated, but they must be considered if you are to present your lodge with an interesting plan of activities. You need to choose programs that will be enjoyable for the majority of the members and will be well attended. The following points may help you in this decision process: "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1) Would the majority of the members be likely to attend? (Are most of the members interested in this type of program or is it too specialized - for example, a bridge tournament as opposed to a cribbage tournament?) 2) Is there a cost to individuals attending? (If the cost is beyond the means of the members of your Lodge, then you can't expect very many to attend. In addition, Senior Citizens often have a limited income and cannot afford functions that are too expensive.) 3) Is the distance to the event too far for most members? (Should a bus or other transportation be provided?) 4) Is the event too late in the day for most members? (Again, Senior Citizens would be unlikely to attend late evening events, but could be available to attend week-day activities.) 5) What is the accessibility of the facility where the program is to be held? (Uneven terrain or a great many steps could mar tfre enjoyment of those members who are Senior Citizens or who are disabled). Finally, you must estimate the value or benefit to the membership of a proposed program, and relate it to the cost of the program. The relative benefits of alternative programs must each be considered in light of their respective cost. Those programs which yield the greatest benefit to your lodge for the least cost are the most effective. F. ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF PROGRAM FUNDING Not all programs need to be funded entirely by the Lodge revenues. A significant portion of the costs related to some kinds of programs could properly be borne by those who choose to participate. For example, a Family Night Program that involves a dinner with a Magician's act following the dinner could properly charge those attending a donation for the dinner plus some or all of the entertainment. In those instances, it is recommended that the precise amount of lodge contribution to the program be identified early, and that the user portion of the program costs be advertised in the trestleboard well in advance of the event. Be sure to state definite cutoff dates for reservations. Also any necessary deposits should be requested at that time. This will have the effect of reducing the number of \"no-shows\" and will also provide working capital for the program. In many instances, programs can be put together which cost very little and yet are still of great interest to many people. Examples of these might include a tour of some private or public facility such as a major dam and powerhouse, a pulp mill factory, a historical museum, train or car museum or... Look around your area, and use your imagination. Your local Chamber of Commerce is a great resource tool that you can use for facilities appropriate to your area. Also, public relations offices are established by many firms and public agencies to make their services known and to establish good rapport with the general public. They often welcome guided tours of interesting operations. Taking advantage of such services may materially reduce your program costs and at the same time provide an interesting program. In some cases, it can even make a good program possible in the first place. An excellent program does not have to be expensive. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"G. FINALIZING THE PLAN You now come to the best part of the budgeting process. You have by now completed the project or program evaluation process and know how much revenue is available for these items. In some instances you may have determined that the benefits to be derived from a particular program warrant its full support by lodge funds. In others, participant charges for all or a portion of the program costs may be warranted. For still others, you may have decided that the lodge cannot afford the program at this time and may have chosen to give the idea to one of your Wardens for their use at a later date. You are now ready to finalize your plan and to correlate your budget with the calendar from your Annual Plan. Your preliminary budget, with your calendar, should be submitted to your budget committee for review and their comments. The final budget should ten be prepared by the budget committee for submittal to and approval by the Lodge. After the budget is approved by the Lodge your plan is ready to submit to your Entertainment Chairman for implementation. REMEMBER, your budget is a plan and as such is subject to change. Don't hesitate to change the plan, with the approval of the Lodge, when it becomes necessary. SAMPLE LODGE BUDGET BOAZ LODGE NO. 59, A. F. A. M.

Respectfully submitted, BUDGET AND FINANCE COMMI'ITEE SECTION 5 HOW TO PUT TOGETHER A TEAM The most important decision made by a Master for his year is the selection of the people who are going to help him throughout the year. In many cases, the decision is taken lightly and the resulting performance is poor. Successful Masters only select and appoint those who are willing to sacrifice the time and energy required to achieve the goals established by the Lodge. Unsuccessful Masters usually continue the appointments of the preceding year with little thought as to the anticipated results. Consider your past and/or present experiences with your own profession and then equate them with your staffing requirements for the Lodge. The staffing for a private company or corporation is not left to chance. Positions are created, job descriptions formulated, employment standards written and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"then people are recruited with the abilities to complete the required assignments. Should it be any different for the many differing positions within your Lodge? The Master has sole discretion to appoint all committee chairmen, committee members and junior non-elected officers. Use this power wisely and with consideration as to what you wish accomplished during your year. Simply to copy that which has come before you is a disservice to you, your Lodge and its membership. This is your time to infuse your Lodge with fresh ideas and new enthusiasm A. OFFICERS When making officer appointments, you have essentially dictated who will inherit the leadership positions within the Lodge in the future years. Utilize input from the present Lodge officers and discuss fully the capabilities of each potential candidate in fulfilling the requirements of present and future offices. Discuss fully with those under consideration exactly what their duties will be and the magnitude of the commitment that is expected from them and their families., now and into the future. Finally, make each decision carefully with full consideration of the requirements that are mandatory to successfully lead the Lodge during the ensuing years. It is far better to leave a position vacant than to appoint one who is not capable of the important duties that await those who ascend to the East. B. RECRUITMENT Some believe it is difficult to find members to fill the required offices and that a warm body is better than nothing. Keep in mind that you are offering a man an opportunity to improve himself as well as serve his lodge. Organizations become successful by diligent attention to their staffing requirements. You must do the same to build a successful Lodge. Here are some helpful hints on officer recruitment: 1. As a Junior Officer, be continually evaluating the entire membership for those who show leadership potential. 2. Begin discussions early with those selected few who share your vision of the Lodge's future potential. 3. Involve them in the meetings which are developing the Lodge's goals and objectives. 4. Solicit their input on solutions to the various problems that have been identified within the Lodge. They already know what those problems are, so only talk about how they are going to be resolved. 5. Create an air of excitement about the prospects of your year and the future of the Lodge. Instill within them a desire to be a part of your winning team and ultimately become the coach. We, regrettably, only support those who are winners, so it is up tQ you to develop your team, set your goals and produce a winner for both ths season and, future years. 6. Maintain a positive attitude about all aspects of Lodge leadership. A \"can do -will do\" instead of a \"can't do - won't do\" attitude will attract"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"many interested individuals. Everyone wants to be a part of a winning team and no one loves a loser. 7. Explain, in real terms, what will be accomplished during the next year and what their role will be in achieving success. Additionally, point out that building a successful lodge is not a one year process and that the planning process will require excellent leadership in future years. There will be many exciting projects remaining for their year in the East. 8. If they agree to join your team, make a commitment to stand by them during their year to assist in achieving their goals and objectives of the Lodge. Recruitment for your team starts with your initial appointment to the progressive line of officers. If you wait until the last moment, you will field a team of substitutes instead of the required 1st string. C. COMMITTEES Start with a fresh slate. Decide which committees are required to implement your program for the year. Talk to the membership about the qualities that are required to accomplish the envisioned tasks. Select a few Brothers who express an interest and appoint them. Fully brief them on what your requirements for the specific assignments are. Once you have selected your teams for the differing committees, follow up your previous conversations with a written description of their duties and responsibilities together with preliminary time frames which you think reasonable to accomplish those tasks. D. THE MASONIC FAMILY A huge untapped resource of manpower available within many Lodges is the Masonic family i.e., the wives and children of members in addition to the membership within the concordant bodies of your temple. Develop positive relations with your total Masonic family and utilize their resources to develop not only your Lodge, but the family as a whole. You need them and, more importantly, they need a successful Lodge from which to expand their membership and achieve their goals. It's a \"'no lose\" situation. The more people who are involved in your activities, the more successful your Lodge will be. Recognize the concordant bodies within your temple or in your area by including them into your planning process. Hold periodic, but frequent, meetings with their leadership and involve them and their membership in achieving the goals and objectives of your Lodge. It is far better to ask their participation and assistance than to ignore their specific problems and create resentment. SECTION 6 HOWTO SET YOUR OFFICERS TO WORK WITH PROPER INSTRUCTION SUGGESTED DUTIES FOR LODGE OFFICERS A. INTRODUCTION By their conduct, their dress, their attendance, their enthusiasm, the proficiency in their work and their attitude, the officers of your Lodge set the tone for the entire lodge operation. Each officer can do much to convey to the candidates and to all members of the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"lodge, the seriousness, the beauty and the honor of Masonry as well as the fun and fellowship. The duties on the following pages are provided as guidelines to achieve the above goals. B. GENERAL GUIDELINES The following topics apply to the operation of all lodges. 1. PROMPTING Only one person present during a degree should by allowed to prompt. Multiple prompting, no matter how well intended, results in confusion and spoils the effect of the ritual. The officer in charge should either do the prompting or assign a prompter. All others. should remain quiet. The official prompter should be announced with the officer line-up. If the Certified Ritual Instructor is present, he should be the prompter. 2. SPECIAL DUTIES OF ThE OFFICER IN CHARGE This refers to the Master, in the case of Stated meetings and Third Degrees; the Senior Warden for Second Degrees; and the Junior Warden for First Degrees. He should take full charge for the evening, being personally responsible for the following: a. Prepare a list of the brethren assigned to fill each station during the degree. Inform them in advance, of the station that they are to fill, giving them time to go over the work before the degree night. b. See that the Tiler knows the degree and the candidate's name(s) so that he is property informed when greeting visitors. c. Be responsible, both inside and outside the lodge room, for all decorum, visitor's comfort and introductions. d. If a visitor is to take part in the work, make sure that he is reasonably proficient in the work of the station involved e. When preparing to close, see that sideliners who are not proficient in the closing ritual are removed from the stations they have filled during the degree so as not to embarrass them. C. ADVANCEMENT NIGHT The officers preparing to advance to the next station in line should be prepared sometime during the middle of the year. There is no official line in a lodge. Every member eligible to vote at an election is eligible to hold office in the lodge. However, most lodges establish an unofficial line that their officers follow as they progress from station to station. The Lodge Officer's duties outlined in this chapter are based upon an assumed line of progression as follows: Junior Steward - Senior Steward - Junior Deacon - Senior Deacon-Junior Warden - Senior Warden - Worshipful Master. This line of progression and the respective duties of each position will prepare the officer for the administrative positjon of Worshipful Master as he progresses through the line. Each officer shall have assigiled duties that provide challenges and experiences that prepare an officer to hold the office of Worshipful Master."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Each officer has the potential of serving his lodge as Worshipful Master. Therefore, it is very important that no Mason should be asked to serve as an officer if you would not be proud to have him as your Worshipful Master. The following duties should be modified and adapted for each lodge as the Master sees fit. They are only to be used as a guideline and as a suggestion for the operation of a lodge. D. SUGGESTED DUTIES FOR LODGE OFFICERS A suggestion is just that, nothing more. A Master has wide latitude to allocate duties. In allocating duties among your officers you will need to keep the limitations in mind: (a) Our Grand Lodge cares for him; (b) The By- laws of your Lodge; and (c) The special utilities of each of your officers. The following is a suggested model. It will need to be adapted to meet the special requests of your Lodge and the differing abilities of each of your line officers. Its value is that it accounts for merely all of the values which will have to be done by someone. Don't drop the ball. Make sure that every task that needs to be done is assigned to someone. SUGGESTED DUTIES FOR A WORSHIPFUL MASTER The Master shall have power to: A. Convene his Lodge whenever he deems it proper; B. Issue, or cause to be issued, all summonses or notices which may be required; C. Discharge all the executive functions of his Lodge; and D. Perform all acts, by ancient usage proper to his office, which are not prohibited by the Constitution and Regulations of Grand Lodge. DUTIES - GENERAL It shall be the duty of the Master to: A. Preside at all meetings of the Lodge; B. Confer or have conferred all degrees in strict accordance with the ritual which has been, or may hereafter be approved by Grand Lodge; C. Give, or have given, in full, the lectures appertaining to each degree, at the time it is conferred in accordance with the ritual; D. Appoint those officers as provided for in the By-laws; E. Attest, at each Stated Meeting of the Lodge, all minutes or records of proceedings as approved at such meetings by the Lodge; F. Superintend the official acts of all the officers of his Lodge and to see that their respective duties are properly discharged; G. Carefully guard against any infraction, by the members of his Lodge, of its own By-laws, or the Constitution and Regulations of Grand Lodge."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" H. Provide for the election of his successor. DUTIES - SPECIFIC 1. To prepare the Lodge's Annual Program. 2. To prepare the Lodge's Annual Budget. 3. To prepare the Master's Trestleboard articles. 4.

SECTION 7 HOW TO GET NEW MEMBERS INVOLVED IN YOUR LODGE If we want our newly raised candidates to take an active part in lodge life, we need at least to give them an introduction to Masonry. Ritual alone, no matter how well done, is not going to make a knowledgeable Mason or an active lodge member. If we want a man who believes in Masonry, a man who is an active lodge member, we have to take the time to show, to teach, to guide that new Mason to a clearer understanding of the tenets of his profession as a Mason. In short, we cannot just raise a candidate and then drop him. We have to start by making sure that we, ourselves, have a positive attitude. Masonry has much to offer. It has been a source of wisdom and"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"personal satisfaction to millions of good men. Its principles and its benefits are as valuable and as timely today as they ever have been. Still, this question confronts us: Why are more young men today not more interested in joining and participating in our fraternity. Many believe the men we want are activity oriented. We want the men who would rather do something than be something. Let us look at some of the community activities which compete for young men's time. Service clubs are growing. They explain to men their community projects and how they raise money to fund them. They are able to show a committed group of people doing something to make a positive impact on their communities. Public safety groups such as fire companies and rescue squads are growing. They show young people the scope of their activity. They demonstrate their equipment and their training programs, and they show a committed group of members intent on doing something to improve their skills. Social clubs, usually centered around sports such as golf, tennis, hunting or fishing, have no trouble maintaining membership. They are able to show interested people their facilities, their schedule of events and activities. They are able to show a group of people who are passionate about their sport and about doing something to improve their performance. New members have joined your Lodge because they want to do something. They want to become more effective in what they do. They want to be involved with others, to be part of an effort, and to share goals. What does Masonry offer them? We can start with brotherly love, relief and truth. The elements of brotherly love are our perfect points: the obligation to go out of our way to serve a worthy brother; the obligation to be ever mindful of the brother in our meditations; the obligation to keep a confidence; the obligation to help a brother and to protect his good name; and finally, the obligation to warn a worthy brother of an approaching danger. We offer this bond to a man who is willing to reciprocate. Relief need not be material relief It can be a helping hand or an understanding ear, a favor or a word of encouragement. The underlying commitment is a willingness to help another Mason or his family with the same level of concern that a man might show to his own brother. We can offer this commitment to a man who is willing to reciprocate. Truth is a value and a measure of the values we are committed to. Each of the three degrees of symbolic Masonry teaches by precept, allegory and symbol the virtues of fidelity, temperance, fortitude, prudence and justice, all of which we hold to be true - true today, true yesterday, and true tomorrow. We are willing to share the legends and the allegories and symbols which illustrate them with men who are willing to commit themselves to the virtues they represent. Brotherly love, relief and truth require personal activity and commitment. We have to do something to put them into practice. Masonry can provide men with an opportunity to do something to improve themselves in pursuit of those truths. Our own legends teach us that in former times apprentices and fellowcrafts learned to improve their skills under the 'guidance and tutelage of Masters. That was true in a operative Masonry. It can become true in your Lodge. Do not permit a candidate simply to \"take\" the three degrees. We should"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"demonstrate to him that the tenets of his profession as a Freemason offer him a way of thinking and a way of living. Here is a twelve point apprenticeship plan to get new members involved, to give them something to do, twelve tasks which are closely related to the tenets of our profession as Freemasons. Let us first consider BROTHERLY LOVE. The candidate needs to get to know his new brothers. Here is what a presiding master can do: Task 1. Make sure the candidate's sponsor introduces him to everyone present the night he is initiated. We have all seen a candidate prepared for his degree sitting alone in a room where a whole group of Masons were chatting with each other, none of whom had been introduced to him or had taken the time to introduce themselves to him. Task 2. Request the candidate and his sponsor to be greeters at the door the night of his second and third degrees. This is a good opportunity for him to speak to the members he met earlier and to meet additional members who are attending that evening. Task 3. ivite the candidate to help out on the first three suppers following his initiation. Remember, he sought membership because he wanted to do something. Involving him in the work of the lodge will make him begin to feel a part of it. Now lets look at RELIEF. Each new Mason needs to learn first hand some of the aspects of Masonic relief and caring. Task 4. Invite the new Mason to work on the first special ladies night following his initiation and see that he personally meets several of them. Task 5. Include the new Mason on the team delivering flowers or baskets or whatever the Lodge may do for widows and elder Brothers during the holiday season. Task 6. Invite him to accompany the Master on a visit to a hospitalized Brother or to a Brother who is shut-in. Task 7 Request him to attend the first two Masonic Memorial Services following his initiation to witness the concern our fraternity feels for the family of a departed Brother. Our third tenet is TRUTH. The candidate should be told that he is expected to obtain a basic familiarity with the legends and symbols which illustrate truths we value. Task 8. Make sure the candidate has the benefit of the four instructional sessions outlined in our Instructor's Manual. You seriously shortchange a man if you make him a member of your Lodge but fail to give him a basic familiarity with the ritual which is at the heart of our fraternity. Task 9. See to it that the candidate visits another lodge three times as he progresses through his degrees, each time to witness the degree he has just taken. This will give him a better understanding of the degree. It will also show him that he is part of a wider fraternity, one that he can take with him wherever he goes. It goes without saying that he ought to be accompanied by his sponsor or brothers he knows well."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Task 10. Invite the new Mason to take a non-speaking chair within a month or two after he is raised either for a degree or simply for a stated meeting. He may never want to do it again, but it is important for him to do it at least once and have the opportunity to feel a part of that ritual. Task 11. Arrange for the candidate to give his third degree lesson either alone or with other recent candidates within the prescribed time. The rule, after all, is ours. We have many, many new Masons who feel that they have failed to do something they should do. They haven't failed. You have failed when you tell them they are expected to do something and then never follow up. Brotherly love, relief and truth are the tenets of our profession as Freemasons. There is another characteristic of Masons that is as old as the history of our country. Every community in this country is a better place to live because of the public spirited Masons who, in hundreds of ways, keep their communities and this country going. They contribute as volunteer firemen, rescue squad members, little league coaches, church deacons and sunday school teachers, as members of boards of hospitals and libraries and in countless other ways. Masons are the bedrock of every community in this country. Task 12. Tell each new Mason, if he has not already done so, that you would like to see him identify one civic, community or church endeavor where he could carry into his community some of the lessons he has learned in his lodge. Twelve points. You should tell a man who indicates an interest in Freemasonry what he would be expected to do in becoming a member. You might give him a pamphlet describing this apprenticeship plan so that he will understand in advance what it is, why you are asking him to do it and how it will benefit him. Such a commitment might discourage a few do-nothing types who simply want to be known as Masons, but men who want do something are attracted to membership in organizations which clearly state their principles, which ask them to make a commitment, and which relate those principles to a specific plan of activity for them. You, as presiding Master, can do a great service to Masonry, to your Lodge, and to your candidates if you will just give them something to do. We have the greatest fraternity in the world, founded on the noblest of principles. Do not forget that it is not enough simply to make a man a member. Our fraternity will grow as an influence for good, our lodges will prosper and our members will grow as good men and Masons only if we focus our thoughts and efforts and the thoughts and efforts of our candidates on Masonry as a way of thinking and a way of living in which brotherhood is the vehicle, the mission and the goal. SECTION 8 HOW TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY How many times have you heard the old excuse from previous Masters: \"Well, if they would just read the trestleboard, they would have known about it\" or \"I put it in the trestleboard and announced it at our last stated meeting\"? In today's society, you must commumcate effectively if you wish to accomplish the goals and objectives you have established for yourself and the Lodge. Relying on techniques that are"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"traditional and only partially successful will leave you with an empty Lodge and an uncommitted membership. You must communicate effectively with your membership if your goal is to build an active and growing Lodge. There are many types of communications: verbal, written, word of mouth, body language, appearance and listening. Each is important if you are going to communicate the three principal tenets of Freemasonry: brotherly love, relief and truth. A. VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS Effective public speaking by the Master and his Officers is a necessity to properly communicate with the membership and their families. Many Masters neglect to develop this important skill, and when placed in front of their public, fail to communicate their goals and programs. They fail to recognize that leadership requires effective and persuasive verbal communications. Would you follow a leader who cannot verbally inspire you to greater effort? What would you think of a Master who stumbles and mumbles when placed before a group of people? The answer obvious. You will shake your head with pity and wait for another year. Don't let that person be you. Reciting ritual during our degrees will help you in developing some speaking ability. However, ritual is simply memory work that is drilled into one's mind and performed repeatedly during practices and degrees. Public speaking requires different skills that can be developed through training and practice. Very few people in this world can be classified as \"natural\" public speakers. In almost every instance when you have heard someone deliver an effective speech, that person has taken the time and effort to prepare himself to communicate effectively. Remember that everyone starts at the bottom, everyone has problems with public speaking and everyone can benefit from further practice and instruction. You may never be the best public speaker, but you can certainly improve. Take the time and make the effort to develop your thoughts, to jot down an outline and to think though it until you have found the words you are comfortable with. You will never regret the time and effort expended, and your members, employer and friends will certainly appreciate your new found skill. B. WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS It is not possible to communicate verbally with your entire membership. You must rely on written materials to get your message out to and be understood by those you wish to reach. The quality and style of your written communications will determine whether or not the materials are actually read. 1. The Trestleboard Reflect back during your years as a junior officer. Did you read your monthly trestleboard? If not, why not? Was it relevant to the actual activities of your Lodge? Take the time to review the actual materials that are included in the trestleboard. Are they necessary? Are the contents interesting and stimulating to read? If the answer is 'no\", then you must do something about it because the response of your membership will be the same. The following are some helpful hints regarding the publication of an interesting trestleboard."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" a. Eliminate the \"garbage\". Some information need not be duplicated month after month, and year after year. Select only those materials that people will actually enjoy reading. b. Select a format that will attract the reader's interest. Small type that is not easily read will save you printing costs, but it will also insure that your trestleboard will quickly find its final destination, with the other junk mail, in the nearest wastebasket. c. Utilize representative graphics when possible to attract the reader's attention and to accentuate the writer's purpose. d. Accentuate the positive! All messages and articles should make the reader want to be a part of the good times that are occurring within your Lodge. Talk about your past, present and future activities in a positive manner. Nobody wants to join in or be part of a negatively oriented Lodge. e. Check the final product. Poor quality paper, graphics and production will lead straight to the wastebasket. f. Plan your monthly production cycle to insure that your readers have the materials in their hands at least two weeks prior to your next stated meeting. A late trestloboard is the same as no trestleboard. g. Invite your membership to submit, for publication, guest articles on different items of interest. 2. Special Mailers The trestleboard is a poor vehicle for some information that must actually be read and understood by the membership. The following are examples of alternate means of written communications that you should consider. a. Special Events Grand Master visitations, picnics, receptions, fund raisers, etc. require a special type of notification to the membership. A special flier with fun graphics will command attention for your fund raising or social events that may otherwise be forgotten in a trestleboard long thrown away. b. Goals and Objectives Utilize a special mailer, which includes the entire package of the results of your teams efforts, to insure that each member is aware of the established goals and objectives pf the Lodge. Your membership will read materials that are in letter form and well produced. c. Signs and Posters All who enter your Lodge should be immediately struck with a graphic display of upcoming special and/or social events planned by the Lodge. Leave nothing to chance. Constant reminders by the trestleboard, letters and posters will effectively promote your activities and assist in achieving success, not only for your Lodge, but for you as Master. C. PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Each person communicates messages to others by the very manner in which he dresses, acts and looks. Take care to see that you are communicating the proper message to those that you wish to influence. The following are some helpful hints: 1. Word of Mouth Your example as Master of the Lodge will be communicated rapidly throughout your Lodge. Human nature, being what it is, will insure that everyone will become informed, either positively or negatively, of your actions. The trick is to \"accentuate the positive\". By doing so, you set the climate for others to do likewise. Every Lodge and every organization has its share of nay-sayers. If you listen and react to those who display a negative attitude, you will also become infected with that frame of reference and the entire Lodge will suffer. On one hand, you have been told to discuss your problems and yet, on the other hand, we want you to \"accentuate the positive\". Are the two directions compatible? They most certainly are. Discussing problems places everything on the table. There is no further need to discuss the negative aspects of your Lodge. Your goals and objectives together with your plans of action are all that now need to be discussed. Discussing solutions to your problems is the finest way to \"accentuate the positive\". If you communicate positively you will find all the brethren communicating by \"word of mouth\" the positive aspects of your Lodge. Positive thinking infects others with a positive attitude. Even those who do not attend Lodge regularly will be proud of your accomplishments. Our fraternity is essentially a social organization designed to provide happiness and brotherly love. If negative thinking has seeped into your Lodge, change it. A successful Lodge is a positive, forward moving Lodge. Act now and insure that all \"word of mouth\" communications are positive. 2. Body Language Communication is more than the written and/or spoken word. Many times we tell others more about ourselves and our attitude by the way we look and act. Emotions of anger, disappointment and frustration, if they are apparent to the membership, not by your words, but by the manner in which you communicate with your body and facial expressions, will create a similar atmosphere within your Lodge. Likewise, if you communicate confidence, satisfaction, and brotherly love by your actions, those positive emotions will also infect the brethren. Who will ever follow a leader whose words say \"charge\", but whose appearance and demeanor indicates \"retreat\"? Changing your body language is easy to say, but hard to do. To be successful, you must continually consider how your attitude and actions will effect your brethren. Every Master has problems and frustrations. The plain facts are that your burden will become heavier and the response of the membership lighter if you communicate disappointment and frustrations. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" If you are going to lead the troops out of the trenches and up the hill, you must communicate to those who must do the climbing that you are in charge and the hill is not that high. Consider the following as you lead the charge: a. Leave All Your Blues At Home Your burdens and frustrations must be kept to yourself. As you prepare to go to Lodge, sit alone for a few minutes, dispel all your problems, and then concentrate on all the positive issues within your Lodge. Think about how you are going to greet your brethren and about the good things you have to say. The important thing is for you to prepare yourself emotionally before you enter any meeting of your Lodge. b. Put On A Happy Face While you are driving to Lodge, keep that positive attitude flowing. Park your car, grab your briefcase, brace yourself from within, put on your happy face and, with a little spring in your step, greet your brethren with joy and brotherly love. You may be unhappy within, but that negative disease will not infect others. c. A Personal Greeting For Everyone Every single person who enters the front door of your Lodge should feel that his presence and participation is vital to the success of the Lodge. Every officer and every member must greet each other with joy and enthusiasm for their participation that evening. A Brother who is not greeted and brought into the circle is a Brother who feels neglected and unwanted, the worst possible emotion. As Master, let others do the routine preparation for your meeting and stand by that front door and personally greet everyone who enters. If a new member or a visiting Brother arrives, have someone standing by to personally introduce him to all in attendance. This is their home away. d. The Clique Includes Everyone Everyone should feel welcome to participate and be an actual part of every Lodge event. The human need to be a part of a social group dictates that, within a Masonic Lodge, every member and every visitor should feel that he and his family are a vital part of the in~~ group. There must never be anyone who feels that he is an \"outsider\" within your Lodge. Extend genuine invitations to everyone, not only by your words, but by your actions. No matter what the event is, either within the Lodge or perhaps a gathering following a meeting, invite all to attendance. Most probably won't attend but they will not feel excluded. Those who do attend will feel closer to the Lodge and its members. They will be driven to greater participation. Remember your emotions when you felt excluded from a group important to you. Those excluded will go elsewhere. Those included will return. 3. Appearance Your personal appearance and that of your officers communicates the manner in which you lead the Lodge. Take a long look at yourself and your officers. Are you, by your very appearance and manner of dress, silently communicating the message to the brethren of the leadership style reflective"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"of your Lodge and the Masonic fraternity. The body language of dress and appearance has forever been important to all successful organizations. The age old saying, \"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it surely must be a duck\", is absolutely true. If you want to be a leader, you must look, act and talk like a leader. The brethren will accept nothing less. The historical traditions of Freemasonry dictate that our meetings and ritual be performed in a formal dignified manner. Do you and your Lodge uphold this standard of excellence or does your manner of dress reflect the standards of less formal clubs or organizations? The sideliners will appreciate that look and feel of a distinguished corps of officers and respond accordingly. A casual and unkept appearance will result in casual and sloppy leadership and ritual. Remember the message you wish to communicate to the membership: leadership and competence. 4. Listening Communication by the absence of the spoken word is, at times, the most effective communication skill that a Master can utilize to achieve his goals. Positive communication only occurs when two or more parties are able to fully and honestly exchange their views on a particular issue. How many times in your own private or employment situation have y%u experienced a person \"who likes to bark orders, but refuses to listen\"? Be open, patient and understanding with your brethren. Be open by continually talking with, not to, the membership. Everyone should feel that you are open minded and will listen to their particular ideas or complaints. Be patient by taking the time to hear them out. If an issue can be readily resolved, do it. If not, explain the reasons why you cannot. The bottom line is that you took the time, listened and communicated back your decision. Everyone should leave a discussion feeling good about the exchange and understanding of each other's positions. If a Brother's view is opposite from your goals and objectives, attempt to brief him fully on the direction which you and your officers have established and ask for his support. Every Lodge has it's nay-sayers. Your challenge is to stay on track with your goals and attempt, through continual persuasion, to bring those opposed into the fold. You may never accomplish this task. A few may fall by the wayside, but the others, who are sitting on the fence, will be impressed by your approach and will offer their support.

Through the ages free men everywhere have aspired to membership in this great fraternal order, and only as the mysteries of Masonry have unfolded before them have they comprehended fully the honor bestowed upon them. The spirit with which you approach your Masonic experience will determine largely how much it will mean to you. One seeking material reward in some selfish form is likely to derive little benefit. One with \"a sincere wish to be serviceable to his fellow creatures,\" as expressed in his application -\"thereby entering with the desire to give of himself in service, sacrifice and fellowship will surely reap a hundred-fold. Come to your Initiation prepared for a time-honored and memorable ceremony. Dismiss from your mind any of those harmless jokes you may have heard about \"riding the goat\" and so on. As you knock at the door of this venerable Institution, enter only with the prayer in your heart that you may be found worthy. Please invite any relatives and friends whom you understand are Master Masons to attend your Initiation. They will be warmly welcomed. It is considered an honor in Masonry to be present when someone you know is receiving the degrees. I wish for you successful programs in your Masonic work and true happiness in your new associations. As we come together in the close fellowship of the Lodge, feel free to call upon me at any time for such advice and assistance as I may be able to provide.

His membership will occasionally take him away from you for an evening meeting. You may be reflecting on his new outside interest. You may have unspoken questions about Masonry itself We can understand your feelings and would like to ease your mind in this regard. It is one of Masonry's ideals that its influence on a member may make him more loving, considerate and thoughtful of those in his home and in his community. Those who respond to the influence of Masonry are likely to grow in the qualities a wife appreciates. This growth cannot be guaranteed, but it is our goal. We sincerely hope that you will find that you have exchanged his occasional evening out for an increasingly devoted husband because of his affiliations with Masonry. We also hope that, in the future, we shall have the pleasure of your company at our semi-public installations and other lodge programs especially planned for the wives of Masons. Should you ever be in the need of assistance, we trust you will remember that there is a body of Freemasons who care. Very shortly we will schedule a meeting to give your husband an overview of Masonry and the three degrees he will be taking. You are cordially welcome to attend that meeting and we look forward to seeing you.

Simon Greenleaf 123 Maple Street Centerville, Maine 04046 Dear Bro. Greenleaf: Now that you have been initiated an Entered Apprentice Mason, I congratulate you on taking this first step toward full membership in Boaz Lodge. Since this is a totally new experience for you, a few points are listed below which may be of interest and of help. 1. You have participated in a time-honored ceremony, the Masonic ritual of the First Degree. I am sure you understand the complete and binding requirement of total secrecy with regard to our ritual. While we have secret signs, words and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"tokens, which we use as means of recognition, vie are not a secret society. The location of our lodges can be found in the local phone book. Similarly, many of our members openly wear Masonic symbols signifying that they are Masons and belong to a Masonic Lodge. Nor is the philosophy that we stand for secret - Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth; and the brotherhood of man. 2. Before you can be passed to the degree of Fellowcraft, you now must commit to memory a portion of the lecture of the First Degree. Do not delay in getting stated with this work. It is not too difficult a task, but the longer you wait, the harder it is to learn. Moreover, the degree schedule of the Lodge assumes that you will proceed promptly to the next step. 3. Remember that Masonic teachings have been passed down through the ages by word of mouth with the help of a cipher. Your Elder Brother is a dedicated Mason who has volunteered to impart these learned phrases to you as you work toward advancement. He is responsible to assist you in becoming proficient in the candidate's lecture of the Entered Apprentice Degree and to prepare you for examination before proceeding to the next step. 4. Your Elder Brother is Brother John P. Jones, 111 Main Street, Centerville, Maine 04046, 207-943-2331. Get in touch with him if you have any questions or need help with your lesson. 5. Your rights and privileges in the Lodge are limited until you become a Master Mason. As an Entered Apprentice Mason you may not attend the Stated Meeting on the first Thursday of each month while business is transacted because Stated Meetings are opeped in the Third or Master Mason's degree. You are most welcome at all sod al functions of the Lodge not restricted to Master Masons. You may not visit another Masonic Lodge, except to observe an Entered Apprentice Degree. You are expected to be present at each Lodge meeting when a First Degree is scheduled, not when Second or Third Degrees are scheduled. Read the Trestleboard which will be mailed to you, and attend Lodge faithfully at the proper times. 6. As I suggested to you previously, remember to invite friends and relatives whom you understand are Master Masons to attend Boaz Lodge, particularly on the nights when you are to receive a degree. We heartily welcome visitors, and any Mason considers it a compliment to be invited when someone he knows is to receive a degree. 7. Finally, understand that all the rules and regulations, such as those I refer to, have been established for a purpose and that all Masons who have preceded you have been governed by the same procedures. Do not hesitate to ask questions as they may arise - of your Elder Brother, of any officer or any member of the Lodge - but, above all, remember that I am as close to you as the nearest telephone and always available for consultation and advice. 8. Very shortly you will be invited to attend an informal review and discussion of the degree you have just taken. Please feel free to raise at that meeting any questions you have about Masonry or about the Entered Apprentice Degree. Good luck as you go forward in your Masonic work. I look forward to the occasion when I may take your hand as a Master Mason and welcome you into full membership in Boaz Lodge.

Box 357 Centerville, Maine 04046 March 2, 1997 Mrs. Simon Greenleaf 123 Maple Street Centerville, Maine 04046 Dear Mrs. Greenleaf: Your husband has received his First Degree in the Masonic Fraternity. He is now an Entered Apprentice and you are now a Mason's Lady. While you personally have not joined our organization, there are certain things that may be helpful for your to know in the future. At the same time, there are matters of general interest about your Mason and his new Fraternity that we think you would like to know. WHEN AND WHERE DID IT BEGIN? The Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons (F.&A.M.) is the oldest, largest and most widely known fraternal organization in the world. It has its roots in antiquity and is directly descended from the association of \"operative masons\", the cathedral builders of the Middle Ages, who traveled through Europe employing the skills of their craft. The organization, as we know it today, began in 1717 in England when cathedral building was on the decline and the \"operative masons\", or \"free masons\" as they were known, started to accept members who were not members of the mason's craft, calling them \"speculative masons\" or \"accepted masons\". Freemasonry was brought to the United States by our early settlers. Today, there are 194 Masonic Lodges in Maine with membership totaling nearly 28,000. Through out the world, there are approximately five million Masons, with nearly three million of them in the United States. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF FREEMASONRY? The basic purpose is to make \"better men out of good men\"; better fathers, better husbands, better broiheis, and sons. We try to place emphasis on the individual man by strengthening his character, improving his moral and spiritual outlook and broadening his mental horizons. We try to build a better world...by building better men to work in their own communities. Membership is limited to adult males who can meet recognized qualifications and standards of character and reputation."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" IS FREEMASONRY A SECRET ORGANIZATION OR A RELIGION? The answer is NO. A secret organization is one which conceals its membership, which has secret meeting places and which conceals from the public, its organization or its principles. This description does not fit the Masonic Fraternity at all. Our secrets are very few in number and deal 9tily with methods of personal recognition, some details of our degrees and privacy of each member's ballot. Freemasonry is not a religion, although it is religious in character. Every applicant for Masonry must express a belief and a trust in God. Masonry does not take the place of religion. It stresses the personal commitment and involvement of each member in the religious community of his own choice. WHAT ARE THE DEGREES? Lessons in Masonry are taught in three separate stages in our Masonic Lodges. The degrees, in order are Entered Apprentice (first degree), Fellowcraft (second degree), and Master Mason (third degree). Each blends Masonic moral philosophy in a unique lesson which is intended to have a serious impact and influence on the man who receives the degree. WHAT ARE MASONIC APRONS? The symbolic apron was worn by operative masons to protect themselves from rough stones and tools. Presently, it is a badge of fraternal distinction. It represents the white lambskin, a symbol of innocence. Some decorations may appear on Masonic Aprons and often designate an officer or special recognition. All are, however, a proud display of membership in this world-wide Fraternity. WHAT DO MASONIC SYMBOLS MEAN? The most widely recognized symbol of the Fraternity is the Square and compasses with the letter \"0\" in the center. Members wear it to remind themselves of their obligation to the lessons learned in their Lodges, and to identify their membership to other Masons and all people. Masonic symbols have wide meanings, some directly relate to the tools used by actual operative masons and some, represent the need for order and direction in life. The letter \"0\" represents God, the Supreme Architect of the Universe. WHEN ARE MEETINGS HELD? Lodges meet in regular monthly sessions called \"stated meetings\" and on such other days as are necessary to conduct its business and ritualistic work. While every Masons's attendance is earnestly solicited, yet it is not intended that a Lodge should interfere with his work or with his obligations to his family or his God. Your husband has invested time and money in joining our Fraternity. He can best receive all that he should by frequently participating in its deliberations and events. We hope that you will approve and encourage him to attend regularly, and we hope also, that you, too, will join us whenever possible for the guest activities held by the Lodge. SHOULD I CONTACT ANYONE WHEN MY HUSBAND IS ILL OR HOSPITALIZED?"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" In the event any member of our Lodge becomes ill, we want to know. You may call the Master or Secretary of this Lodge. Your husband has joined an organization which wants to assist him and you when in need, and we need your help to do it. WHAT CAN YOUR INVOLVEMENT BE? Countless opportunities abound through active participation and membership in any of the numerous Masonic-related ladies organizations. You are encouraged to share in many activities of the Lodge. Non-Masonic friends and families may also take part in many Masonically supported programs. We hope you will be proud that your husband has chosen to become a member of the world's oldest and best fraternity. We welcome you as a \"Mason's Lady\".

Simon Greenleaf 123 Maple Street Centerville, Maine 04046 Dear Bro. Greenleaf: Now that you have been passed to the degree of Fellowcraft, I again take pleasure in congratulating you on your advancement in Masonry. Only one more step remains before you earn full membership in Boaz Lodge. As you know, our Head Candidates' Coach is Brother John P. Jones, 111 Main Street, Centerville, Maine 04046, 207-943-2331. Get in touch with him promptly and work out your coaching schedule with the Second Degree Coach, thus relieving him of the responsibility of seeking you out in connection with this necessary work. With respect to attendance, you are now invited to be present at the Lodge on all First Degree and Second Degree nights. Not, of course, when Third Degrees are scheduled. You will be welcome to attend Stated Meeting of the Lodge after you have received the Master Mason Degree. I hope that you will take advantage of all such occasions to become better acquainted with the members of your Lodge. Remember my suggestions about inviting relatives, business associates or other friends whom you understand to be Master Masons, particularly on the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"evening of your Third Degree. It will mean a great deal to those friends of yours to be present and in later' years, as you look back, it will mean much to you.

Greerileaf: This is the last of the series of letters I address to each new Brother as he progresses through the Masonic degrees. Again, let me offer you warmest congratulations and welcome you as a Master Mason and member of Boaz Lodge. It is now timely to consider your future course of action in Masonic affairs. As you have learned, Masonry is a progressive science, and you will find more and more of its inspirational teachings unfolding through the years as you participate in our Lodge activities. Privileged as I am to serve as Worshipful Master, I find that each new Masonic experience brings a deeper awareness of Freemasonry. It is a continuing, enriching and enlarging philosophy. First, of course, prepare for your final proficiency examination in the Master Mason Degree. I suggest that you do not delay as the memory work is much easier while the experience of the degree is still fresh in your mind. Secondly, look at the various avenues for participation in the activities of Boaz Lodge so as to find the areas where you will be the happiest in your new Masonic home. There is such a variety of ways to serve and to benefit: a period of duty on the Stewards' Committee, waiting on the Brothers who have waited on you; learning to participate as a sideliner in some aspects of the degree work; supporting the Lodge simply by regular attendance at Stated and Special Meetings; calling on a Brother who is ill; bringing wives, families and friends to our social functions; taking up the study of Masonic research; and, of special importance, partaking of all the good fellowship which is available to you through your Lodge."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" May you chart your Masonic course with wisdom and humility, and may you experience the rewards which are yours to earn and receive.

I would appreciate a call from you on those occasions. This is particularly true on Stated Meeting nights as we are counting on you to be there. The Stewards and the Committee have the responsibility of setting up the dining room and serving either dinner before or refreshments after the meeting.

Sincerely yours, Hiram Drummond Worshipful Master SECTION 10 HOW TO MAKE YOUR TRESTLEBOARD MORE INTERESTING Communication is necessary to a successful life or to a successful lodge. In order to be effective, an employer must communicate clearly to his employees, a father to his children, and a Master to his officers and members. Trestleboards are the essential communication tool of the Master. It takes the lodge to 100% of the membership, whether they are active members who participate in the lodge activities or are housebound non- driving members who cannot attend any of the lodge functions. For many members it is the ONLY contact that they have with their lodge and gives them a feeling of knowing the active members of the lodge by reading their names in the trestleboard. A. TRESTLEBOARD APPEARANCE The trestleboard projects' the lodges s image to its members and, perhaps more importantly, to non-members. You never know who will pick up a copy of your latest trestleboard, and after reading it come away with an impression of Masonry and your lodge. The impression can be favorable or"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"unfavorable depending on how well the trestleboard is written and its overall appearance. How does your trestleboard look? How can it be improved? Take a critical look at your present trestleboard. Is it too big or too small? Having a large trestleboard means that you can put more in it. But sometimes the content of the articles suffer when you have to fill those large spaces. On the other hand, a larger size gives you the opportunity to increase the print size - this make it easier for your older members to read. Should you use photographs in the trestleboard? It costs more money, but as the old saying goes \"A picture is worth a thousand words\". Whatever you decide to do, make your trestleboard eye appealing and don't forget that it projects your lodge's image. Keep it well written. B. IDEAS FOR TRESTLEBOARD ARTICLES There are many sources available to you - almost everywhere you look! Previous trestleboards from your own lodge and from other lodge's; your own periodicals or your Maine Mason, news magazines, the Reader's Digest, local newspapers, and others all provide inspiration. Publications from concordant bodies such as Scottish Rite's Northern Light, the York Rite's Knight Templar, etc., are also excellent sources of ideas. Books on Masonry from your personal library, the local library or the Grand Lodge library are other possible sources. In addition, the Research Lodges have more material, from their monthly articles to books that you can purchase or borrow, than you can ever use. A less obvious source is to use notes taken while you are attending Masonic or non-Masonic functions. Look around you. You're sure to find many more sources. If you quote an article or a part of an article you must obtain the permission of the author and in many cases the publisher as well. You will probably find that it is easier to obtain the permission of Masonic authors, but you must still get their permission. So now what? Well you don't have to use the article directly. Instead use the idea of the article. You don't have to have permission to use the idea when you use your own words. So, rewrite the article using the idea behind its words. Sometimes the article lends itself directly to your words. For example, one Master read an article that had left all of the o's out. This made the article very difficult to read. So he wrote a trestleboard article using this technique. In this article he told the members of his lodge how hard it was to lead the lodge without their support and presence. This idea could be used in any number of ways. You only have to use your imagination. Remember if you use direct quotes - YOU HAVE TO HAVE PERMISSION; if you use your own words, you don't. C. WHEN TO START COLLECTING IDEAS When should you start collecting articles/ideas for your trestleboard? AS SOON AS YOU CAN. Start when you are the Junior Warden or even earlier if possible. Why? Some articles you would like to use are jime related. They appear about a year ahead of the time that you need them. For example, articles on George Washington's Birthday usually only appear once a year in February. If you wait until you need this article you can't get it into your February trestleboard as it needs to be written and submitted to your trestleboard editor in January. Collect early and be sure to gather two to"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"three times the quantity that you'll actually use. Some ideas don't look as good on review at a later date. D. GETTING ORGANIZED The best way to organize your items for trestleboard articles is to cut and paste the. newspaper or magazine articles onto 3x5 cards. For books or magazines that you can't or don't want to deface, copy the pages first and then cut and paste. If you carry a few 3x5 cards with you when you attend Masonic functions you can make your notes directly on these and you will be prepared to use your notes directly when you return home. Next file your 3x5 cards by topic or by theme. For example, George Washington's Birthday, the 4th of July, Valentine's Day, Masonic Affiliated Youth Orders, Masonic education articles, etc. Then shortly after the Annual Communication of Grand Lodge, when you have completed your annual plan as Senior Warden, you can start putting your ideas for next years trestleboard articles together. Sort the articles and ideas that you have collected into monthly files. Use the monthly themes that you have established for your annual plan. For example, if in February you have planned a Sweetheart's Night program, articles or ideas about Valentine's Day could be placed in this month. In May, you might have decided to have a Founders Day, programs and articles about the history of the lodge or local area would be appropriate here. In June, you might have planned a trip to the Seadogs. This is a good time to use articles on Masonic Education such as - Where the expression Meet me on the level\" come from? or Why does the Master wear a top hat?\", as you probably won't be writing about baseball. Having a well thought out plan will make the sorting of your articles easier. When you have finished sorting the articles and ideas that you have collected, you will find that you have many left over. Pass these files on to your junior officers. These files will help them get started get started on their own collection, and in a very short time the Lodge will have an impressive resource file. E. THE MASTER MESSAGE Masters have given the writing of the Master's message different priorities. Some look forward to the opportunity of contacting the membership of the Lodge and presenting them with ideas that they have. Others feel that this is the worst thing that has ever happened to them, so they use their Lodge Secretary or even their printer to write their articles. There is nothing wrong with using an Editor or Trestleboard Committee to edit and setup the trestleboard, BUT THE MASTER MUST WRITE THE MASTER'S MESSAGE. It cannot be delegated. The Master has an obligation to communicate with his Lodge. So, if it is so tough, what can you do to make it easier? The above paragraph - GETTING ORGANIZED - has already given you some ideas that you can use to make the job easier. The following are some additional ideas you might use: 1. For the first trestleboard use your annual plan. Lay out your plans for the coming year. Let everyone see what you have planned and the date it is planned for. Then use your annual plan to provide you with other ideas for the month as suggested above."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 2. You might write about important upcoming Lodge events such as a Ladies's Night program or Mason of the Year Awards. Or perhaps your Past Master's Night line-up. But, leave the monthly description of your other Lodge events to others. 3. Recognize members who have given community service, i.e., a man who has been Scoutmaster for many years, the president of the local Rotary, or adult leaders of Rainbow and DeMolay. 4. Recognize the youth leaders of DeMolay and Rainbow. Give a short biography of the leaders and a history of the youth group itself. 5. Enlighten the members with some Masonic education. Write an article on \"What does this mean? or \"Where does that come from?\" For example, where does the \"blue\" in \"Blue Lodge\" come from? The possibilities are endless. 6. Use topical articles tied to the time period. For example, Washington's Birthday, the 4th of July, Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, and Election Day. (You can't talk about who's running, but you can encourage the membership to get out and vote. Remind them it's a privilege and an obligation.) But whatever you write, be optimistic, enthusiastic and informative. There is no faster way to drive your membership away than to blast them, month after month, with a guilt trip for not attending Lodge. As the old saying goes \"Honey attracts more bees than vinegar ever will\". F. TRESTLEBOARD HELPERS Unless you, as Master, want to write the entire trestleboard yourself, you had better enlist some help. The two naturals are the Junior and Senior Wardens. Its good experience for them and will give them some preparation for their year as Master. Make sure their assignments are clear: it would be unfortunate if each wrote on the same topic. The Senior Warden might write on the degrees that are to be exemplified in the coming month or give a thumbnail sketch of your newest Master Mason. The Junior Warden might review last month's program giving a brief overview of the program and mention how good it was to welcome back any brethren (by name) who might be infrequent attendees to the Lodge. He might preview nex$~month's program, its entertainment, or the supper. If either of the Wardens is chairman of a committee, this is a good opportunity to report to all the Brethren what that committee is doing. The Secretary could also write some articles regarding membership, dues, and information address change reminders. He might also write a \"Secretary's Corner\" giving about members who have moved away or are travelling and what their families are doing. Miscellaneous articles could also be written such as a Sunshine Report (sickness and distress), memorials (obituaries), monthly calendar of events, a thumbnail sketch of your officers (one at a time, please), and a list of your appointments (semi-annually). The list goes on and on. G. TIME LINE SCHEDULE FOR PRINTING "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" It is critical that the trestleboard reach the membership in a timely fashion. If it arrives after the events have occurred, you have frustrated your membership and wasted valuable time, effort and money. One way to ensure the timely arrival of your trestleboard is to establish a time line schedule. The development of a time line is described as follows: 1. Itemize the tasks involved in producing and distributing the trestleboard. These tasks might include writing the articles, organizing the contents, printing, stuffing and sorting for mail, mail time, time required for the trestleboard to be in the members hands before the Stated Meeting (reading time). 2. Next, determine the number of days that each task requires, Then, starting with the coming month's Stated Meeting, and work backwards through the month. For example, if your Stated Meeting is on March 6th, the time line would end with March 6th and you would count backwards through February. 3. Mark off the days that each task would take, starting with the last task and work through to the first task. In the example shown, it would be necessary for you to start writing your trestleboard articles on February 3rd. All of the articles would have to be completed, ready for organizing. By February 10th. You, of course, will have to establish your own time line requirements. SECTION 11 HOW TO...SET UP A TELEPHONE TREE There are many times when a Master wants to get word out quickly and directly to the membership. Those include Memorial Services, a public supper or some other Lodge event where he would like to have a good turn-out. It is not possible for him to contact everyone himself, but with a good telephone tree, he can do it. These are the steps: First, identify your members who live locally who would like to be called and who are able to attend your events. Second, pick your Chairman. Third, enlist one conmiittee member for each ten brothers you would like to be able to contact. Fourth, give each of your Committeemen a list of ten (10) members he is to call and tell him to put it in his wallet. Here is what it looks like in outline: TELEPHONE COMMI'ITEE leboard Secretary Wardens MASTER Care & Share Activity AL Committee Chairman Chairman / Transporation xTelephone Conunittee Committee / Chairman airman"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" I Coffimittee Committee Committee Committec members may be house-bound or bed-ridden. Enlist their aid by personal contact. As a control to verify that each committeeman is doing his job regularly, it may be worthwhile to have one officer or regular attender on each committeeman's list. If he does not receive his call on time, he can contact the Master or committee chairman. The Master receives input from his Wardens, Secretary and various commiltee chairmen and from this, determines what the telephone information will be. He gives this to the Telephone Committee chairman who passes it along to the committee members, who in turn pass it to the Brethren on their list. Feedback from the members such as sickness, need for transportation to a meeting, future change of address, etc., is sent back to the chairman who passes it to the Master or the Secretary. The above chart is made for a Lodge with a calling list of 100 members. It can be enlarged or reduced, to suit the size of the Lodge and its membership within the \"toll free\" calling radius. The Chairman might be one of the regular officers. SECTION 12 HOW TO... RUN A GOOD BUSINESS MEETING Meetings, meetings and more meetings, is that all I have to do as Master? Assembling your officers and members, soliciting their input and judgement in a properly managed meeting is a primary function of the Master. There is no question that your effectiveness in the East will be greatly enhanced if you manage your meetings properly. Conversely, your Lodge will suffer if you fail to execute this important element of your leadership responsibility. Many types of meetings will be held. Some will be small, with individuals or committees and some will be large to include Stated Meetings and Degrees. The important principles of managing meetings remain the same. Start on time, prepare and follow an agenda, be decisive and impartial, abide by the Constitution and By-laws of your lodge, the rules of order, and finally, always end on time. A properly planned and executed meeting results in good participation. A poor meeting achieves the opposite results. For the purpose of this discussion, meetings are divided into three categories: stated meetings, degree meetings and committee meetings. A. STATED MEETINGS The primary forum by which the business of Freemasonry is conducted in your Lodge is the stated meeting. You may make decisions, committees may meet and agree on specific issues, but nothing is firmly resolved until it has been"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"brought before and voted upon by the brethren at a Stated Meeting. Then and only then can these decisions be considered the policy and practice of the Lodge. An astute Master will realize the limits of his authority and seek approval, by a vote of the membership, prior to proceeding on any new policy and/or practice. Even if the issue is insignificant, the brethren will be offended if not consulted. Your Stated Meeting is of utmost importance. If you use it to your advantage, you will be successful. 1. The Stated Meeting As An Event A simple line in the trestleboard \"Stated Meeting - Thursday, July 6, at 7:30 pm\" is totally inadequate to inspire the brethren to attend and participate. Each Stated Meeting should be promoted as an event not to be missed. Something important, interesting and exciting are the ingredients for a good evening program. Plan and develop exciting evenings and then promote them extensively. You might consider appointing a chairman and small committee for each stated meeting. This will give others a sense of involvement and, if a junior officer is delegated, it will offer him some vital training and experience. Start with a supper for the members, their families and even invited guests. A good meal at a reasonable price always attracts additional members. Follow up your supper with a program of activities, i.e., guest speakers, awards, etc. Always have some program that will attract the interest or encourage others to feel an obligation to attend. Everyone should feel that they should attend so that they will not miss out on something important. Following your program, adjourn to the Lodge room, but provide for additional activities or programs for the ladies and guests that you have left behind. 2. Planning a Stated Meeting Prior to every Stated Meeting, plan your agenda for the business that must be transacted. Do not leave agenda planning to others such as the Secretary. Stated Meetings are your meetings and must be planned and executed by you alone with input from others. Delegating this responsibility allows others to dictate the priority of business and severely reduces your authority. YOU ARE THE BOSS. Once the agenda has been developed, publish the highlights of the next meeting in the trestleboard to attract the interest of the brethren. Let them know what business is to be conducted, what decisions are going to be made and perhaps, they may find something of interest and attend. If there are a number if important items to be considered, place a stack of prepared agendas outside the lodge room for every member to take a copy for reference. Everyone can now be aware of the order of business and can become involved. 3. Start On Time and End on Time The By-laws of your Lodge dictate the starting time for your Stated Meeting. The starting time is specific. A meeting should not commence either before or after the designated time. Meetings that start on time, end on time. Meetings that start late, either end late or the business is rushed and poorly transacted. If the meetings begin to start late, you can depend upon attendance declining. When the clock strikes the designated hour, the gavel must sound. 4. Stick To The Agenda"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" The order of business is clearly outlined in the Officers Manual - follow it. Conduct your business \"by the numbers\", and you will find that decisions are made, time will remain for a lively informal time after the meeting. The brethren can then depart at a reasonable hour. A meeting that lasts approximately an hour should be sufficient to conduct your required business. Anything longer, on a routine basis, will result in declining participation. B. DEGREE-MEETINGS The evenings of degrees are of vital importance to the success or failure of your Lodge. The first impression that you and your Lodge make upon the candidate occurs during his initial exposure to the manner in which the degrees of Masonry are conferred. For the purposes of this publication, we have not dwelled upon ritual. However, you know in your heart the importance of properly executing our ritual to make that first impression positive and lasting. That lasting first impression can also be greatly enhanced by proficiently organizing, planning and executing the degree nights of your Lodge. The following are some helpful hints that can assist you in achieving successful degree nights: 1. Orientation The orientation of a candidate starts before he is initiated into our fraternity. A simple letter or conversation with him is not enough to provide him and his family with the necessary information on what is expected of him during the process of his becoming a full member of your Lodge. After the election and before his initiation, schedule a meeting with the candidate and his family to discuss exactly what is going to happen to him and what are the expectations of your Lodge. He should be fully informed on the process, his proficiency requirements, and the proper conduct and dress expected within the Lodge. A candidate embarrassed over a trivial mistake is a candidate that may never return. After the initial meeting and the initiation ceremony, the candidate's coach should be fully trained to continue the education of the new member. There is ample information available through the Grand Lodge assist you in this endeavor. USE IT. 2. Consistent Scheduling Attending Lodge is a duty that must be ingrained into the membership. Consistency in the scheduling of the dates and times for your degrees is desirable if candidates are available, or at least a practice, on the days chosen, if candidates are not available. \"If this is Thursday, there must be a degree\", should be the scheduling system with every Lodge. Scheduling degrees on different nights and at different times will confuse the membership and result in less attendance. Establish a system and, except for unusual circumstances, stick with it. Always be consistent! Although it is not always possible in each Lodge, an example of such a system is as follows: 1st Thursday Stated Meeting 2nd Thursday 1st Degree 3rd Thursday 2nd Degree 4th Thursday 3rd Degree If a certain degree is not scheduled for a particular month, leave the night vacant or schedule an additional practice. If a double degree, especially a"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"third degree, is scheduled, utilize the vacant night. Keep with your schedule and your members will know what to expect. 3. Have Your Act Together The number one order you must give to each officer concerning degree nights is that arrive they must notify you, in advance, if they will be unable to attend a specific degree. To at the Lodge, with the candidate standing by and not have a full complement of the required officers to properly confer the degree is inexcusable. To hurriedly scramble to assemble a degree team, immediately before a meeting, certainly puts doubts in a candidate's mind as to the quality of your organization. Every officer cannot be present at every degree. Recognize this fact of life and prepare for the inevitable. Maintain a list of the members of your Lodge who can properly perform the required ritual in specified stations. Call the day prior to each degree, make a list of the stations required for the specific degree and personally confirm wnh each individual that he will be present and ready to participate. Your other officers should always be present and only notify you when they cannot. You need to keep a list of members who can do the parts in each degree. If a vacancy occurs, fill from your list. Always accomplish this task well before arriving at the Lodge, never just before. 4. Greet Your New Brethren Special care must be made to assure that the new candidate is personally greeted and introduced to each member in attendance. Delegate this task to one of your officers on a permanent basis. Your Head Candidates' Coach may me a good selection for this assignment. The new candidate should feel that he is among brethren, not strangers. 5. Don't Forget The Family The first degree evening also presents an excellent opportunity for the wife of the candidate to meet counterparts within the Masonic family which they are soon to join. Make this a full evening by scheduling, during the degree, a meeting at a home with all the ladies of your Lodge. After the degree, invite the brethren to the home so that they can also meet and socialize with the new candidate and his lady. They will be able to enjoy new friends and, most importantly, learn the practices and customs of your Lodge and its Masonic Family . Try it - You will enjoy it and so will your new candidate and his lady. 6. Keep on Schedule Degrees can be as short as the ritual requires or as long as you allow them to drag out. The secret to successful degree nights is to (again) start on time. Secondly, make the required breaks in ritual short, but adequate, for the brethren to take a break and briefly socialize. Lastly, keep the comments at the conclusion of the meeting pertinent to the situation. Some comments are best left to the banquet room during refreshments. If you run an orderly and efficient degree meeting, the brethren will appreciate it and your attendance will reflect your efforts."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 7. Have a Supper Take the necessary time and make the necessary effort to make the refreshment time an enjoyable occasion. Poorly prepared refreshments and sloppy presentation in cluttered surroundings equal a negative impression on the new candidate and also with your membership. There is no excuse for poor refreshments. Your Junior Warden has the specific responsibility for this task. He should do his job. If he isn't, your job is to correct the situation. At a minimum, the following standards should be met: a. The tables should be arranged in an orderly fashion, properly covered, set and ready for use. b. Either the Stewards or the Refreshment Committee should be dismissed, prior to the closing of Lodge, so that refreshments are served and waiting on the table for the arrival and enjoyment of the brethren. c. The Stewards or Refreshment Committee are standing by to serve the needs of those attending. They, themselves, should not be seated until all have been served and no further service is required. d. Conduct a short program: introductions, comments, etc. Make it short and to the point so that the brethren may depart at an appropriate time. 8. Follow up Immediately The degree night should never end until the candidate has been introduced to his coach and arrangements have been made for instruction in the candidate's lecture. The assigned coach should be present at the degree and, before the evening is over, arrangements must be finally established as to the time and location of his first proficiency lesson. Start immediately and your chances of success are greatly enhanced. C. COMMIITEE/OFFICER MEETINGS The following are some helpful hints for planning and conducting your committee/officers meetinaw 1. Scheduling As you plan your term, preparation of a calendar of events for the entire year is mandatory to properly schedule and notify members of your activities. Prior to the beginning of your year, you have formed your committees, designated your chairmen and appointed officers. Now is the appropriate time to schedule the dates and times of the your meetings of each committee. It is certainly easier to cancel a pre-scheduled meeting than to hurriedly assemble the brethren for an unscheduled and unplanned meeting. Some committees must meet frequently and others only on a periodic basis. Determine beforehand the frequency you wish each committee to meet and designate firm dates and times on your master schedule for the entire year. Notify each member of each committee, in writing, to calendar the date, time and location of each scheduled meeting. Never forget that last minute scheduling will result in low"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"attendance, little interest and a poor product. It is important that your committee meeting be first on a member's calendar before other activities create a conflict. 2. Notification Regrettably, some people forget, others lose their calendars and a few are able to manufacture the world's greatest excuses why they did not attend a meeting. You may not be able to guarantee full attendance at these meetings, but you surely can increase your odds by utilizing the following system of reminders: a. Publish your committee meetings in the trestleboard in sequence with your other Masonic events. b. Routinely publish small articles in the trestleboard on the results of past meetings and items presently under discussion. c. Order and supply each of your committee chairmen with a quantity of pre- printed post cards and stamps that allow them to fill in the blanks on committee meeting dates and times. Delegate to them the responsibility of mailing a card to each committee member at least two weeks prior to the scheduled meeting. d. A follow up telephone call, by the committee chairman, the weekend prior to the meeting, will reinforce the importance of their participation. You have now done everything possible to insure full participation. If unsuccessful, your only other alternative is to replace those not attending with others who will. A committee member who does not attend is of no value to your ad ministration. 3. Committee Meeting Procedures Committee meetings can be short, to the point and very productive if your committee chairmen follow a few easy rules. Hold a planning meeting with each committee chairman and discuss the manner in which all meetings will be held. Share with them the ideas following contained within this chapter and attempt to get everyone off on the right foot and the same format. Committee chairmen should, at a minimum, accomplish the following: a. Be familiar with your goals and objectives for the committee. Meet with you a few days before the scheduled meeting and prepare an agenda of the work to be accomplished. b. Arrive at least 45 minutes before the scheduled meeting time. Arrange the furniture, distribute the agendas, plug in the coffee pot, set the table and be ready to greet the brethren and start your meeting. Do not consume the valuable time of the committee with extraneous nonsense or housekeeping arrangements. c. Start on time. Waiting for stragglers will certainly agitate those who arrive on time. The informal message that is being conveyed is that there is no need to arrive on time because meetings never start as scheduled. If delays are allowed to begin, they will compound themselves at future meetings. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"d. Begin each meeting with a short overview of the agenda, what business you wish to transact and the goals you wish to achieve at the conclusion of the meeting. e. Designate a Brother to take minutes and prepare final resolutions to be presented, when required, for consideration by the Lodge. f. Stick to the agenda. Do not allow any side discussions to occur until all the planned business has been transacted. g. Follow the established rules of order. (A brief discussion on Rules of Order can be found in Appendix A.) h. If time has elapsed and business remains, then you have only three options schedule an additional meeting, hold the business over until the next scheduled meeting or extend the meeting for a specified time. If this occurs, (it shouldn't if you have done your job right) seek the will and pleasure of the committee and abide by their majority vote. SUGGESTED DUTIES FOR A HEAD CANDIDATE COACH 140Th: There is no official title \"Head Candidate's Coach.\" The Senior Warden is in charge of all candidate coaching, but he may assign someone with that overall duty; hence, the reason for the \"Head Candidates Coach\" title. However, the Senior Warden is not relieved of the responsibility. DUTIES - GENERAL 1. To keep a list of all candidates, record their progress in learning their lessons in all degrees and report the same to the Senior Warden and to the Master; 2. To see that every candidate is supplied with an Elder Brother; 3. To see that every Elder Brother is supplied with an Instructor's Manual; 4. To certify that all candidates are qualified in their lesson prior to giving it in open Lodge; 5. To be qualified to give the Candidate's lesson questions in all Degrees; 6. To be prepared to examine the candidates in open Lodge. 5. SECTION 13 HOW TO... RECEIVE THE DISTRICT DEPUTY Your District Deputy will visit you several times during your term. On his unofficial visitation, you should ask him beforehand if he would like to join you in the East. Most District Deputies decline to join you in the East on an"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"unofficial visitation. It would be good if more District Deputies accepted because having the District Deputy there on unofficial visitations sometimes makes a Master less uncomfortable when he is there on his official visitation. It is always important to introduce or acknowledge a District Deputy when he is visiting unofficially. Most District Deputies decline any grand honors when they are visiting unofficially, but in most districts it is the custom to give public grand honors, the first time a newly installed District ,Deputy visits a Lodge. A visiting District Deputy should be afforded the last opportunity to speek, even when he is visiting unofficially. The exception would be if the Grand Master or Deputy Grand Master were also present. At your official visitation or inspection much more formality is required. There is a format for receiving the District Deputy. You should ask the acting Grand Marshal before the meeting if the District Deputy has any changes to the format which follows: Open your Lodge through to the point where the Jr. Deacon reports that the Lodge is tyled and the Wor. Master has said, \"I thank you Bro. Jr. Deacon.\" The Grand Marshal makes an alarm at the tyled door by * * * raps. W.M. \"Bro. Sr. Deacon' (rises and salutes) \"you will ascertain the cause of that alarm.\" S.D. (With Rod, goes to tyled door, gives* * * raps, opens door and says.) \"Who comes here?\" Gr. Mar. \"The Acting Grand Marshal with a communication.\" S.D. (Goes behind altar, salutes and says.) W.M. the Acting Grand Marshal awaits without with a communication.\" W.M. \"Bro. Sr. Deacon you will inform the Acting Gr. Mar. that he has permission to enter.\" S.D. (Salutes, returns to tyled door, opens it and says.) \"Bro. Or. Mar. you have permission to enter.\" (Sr. Deacon remains by tyled door.) Thereafter, if the District Deputy presents an unofficial visit, private grand honors should given. All past and present Grand Lodge officers should be attending this honor at the same time. Gr. Mar. (Goes behind altar, salutes and says.) \"Wor. Master, the R.W.D.D.G.M. of the 19th Masonic District is without with his Suite and awaits to be admitted.\" W.M. \"Bro. Grand Marshal, you will inform our R.W.D.D.G.M. that a proper escort will await upon him. (The Acting Gr. Mar. salutes and goes out. Sr. Deacon opens and closes door then returns to his station.) W.M. \"Bro. Marshal, you will form an escort consisting of the Sr. and Jr. Stewards and Sr. and Jr. Deacons and escort our R.W.D.D.G.M. and his Suite into the lodge room.\" "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"(Escort goes out tyled door. Marshal, Sr. and Jr. Stewards and Sr. and Jr. Deacons form in front of the Suite.) (Procession enters the Lodge Room, Lodge Marshal enters far enough to leave room for Stewards and Deacons, then steps to right. Stewards enter, halt behind Marshal, open to the right and left and cross rods. Deacons stop beside Stewards.) Gr Mar. 'The R.W.D.D.GM.\" W.M. (***Rises and removes his hat) Gr. Mar. Acting Or. Mar. forms Suite behind altar. Conducts the D.D.G.M. behind altar, salutes and says.) \"Wor. Master, it is my pleasure to introduce R.W. Bro. James Smith, R.W.D.D.G.M. of the 25th Masonic District of Maine.\" W.M. \"Bro. Gr. Mar., you will escort the R.W.D.D.G.M. to the East.\" (Wor. Master descends all the way to the floor. Escort breaks and go directly to their stations, W.M. says.) \"R.W. Bro. Smith, on behalf of the officers, members and guests of - Lodge I welcome you. Would you please face the West?\" \"Brethren, it is my pleasure to introduce to you Bro. James Smith, R.W.D.D.G.M. of the 25th Masonic District of Maine. You will with me accord him the Private Grand Honors, taking your time from the East.\" (Private Grand Honors, due guard and sign of the three degrees, no Grand Hailing Sign, to be given only in tyled lodge. And now, R.W., it is my pleasure to present you the gavel of _______ Lodge that you may continue with the introduction of your Suite. R.W.D.D.G.M. (Continues with the introduction of the Suite and returns the gavel to the Wor. Master.) W.M. \"R.W. Bro. Smith, I welcome you to a seat in the East.\" W.M. gives one rap * to seat the brethren then continues with the opening of the Lodge NOTE: Other than the title \"Most Worshipful\", there is only one change in the foregoing for the reception of the Grand Master. When the escort goes out the tyled door, the Senior and Junior Deacons form in the rear of the Grand Master. SECTION 14 HOW TO... ARRANGE INTERESTING PROGRAMS Here is a step by step procedure that you can use to help you put together a program for your lodge. This procedure can be used for any program. For the purposes of the example a Mason of the Year program has been used. Be sure to contact the various Grand for help with any programs that you might want to put on Lodge Committees (Constitution, Observance, Public Schools,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Youth Orders, Layman's Night, widows - to just name a few). Many of them also have planning procedures that they tailored for their program. A.. Select a committee for the program night. The committee may already exist. For example - the Fellowship Committee - could handle a Sweetheart's Night program while the Care and Share Committee could handle the planning for a Veterans' Night program during the month of June or September. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that the Mason of the Year Committee h~s already selected the candidate and that a separate cornrriittee has been selected to plan and execute the program. B. Give the committee some specific tasks that you want accomplished. For example, I you might want the Fellowship Committee to pian a program for a specific date that would bring in the widows of the lodge, recognize them and provide some entertainment that would interest all the members of the lodge. C. Let the committee plan the event and report back to you with their plans. Their plans should be competed within 60 - 90 days prior to the event and should include the following: 1. LOCATION. If your lodge dining room is too small for the anticipated crowd, don't hesitate to find a larger place. However, one of the advantages of having the program in the lodge is to bring in and acquaint outsiders with Freemasonry and particularly with your lodge. This gives you an excellent opportunity to show off your lodge to non-Masonic guests. 2. MENU. The menu for a special event, like a Mason of the Year presentation, should be special, but don't lose sight of the cost. If the dinner is too expensive, you may have some members who would like to attend but can't because of the expense. 3. PUBLICITY. Articles should be inserted in the trestleboard for at least two months prior to the event. In addition, particularly for a large event, your committee should plan an having one article submitted to the local newspaper. (Check with your Grand Lodge Public Relations Con'rxnittee for sample articles and help with this publicity). For any activity honoring a member of your lodge, whether it's a Mason of the Year Award, a 50 year medal or other, you should take into account any contacts that the recipient has outside of Masonry and be sure to inform them of the event with an invitation to attend. 4. PHOTOGRAPHER. An experienced photographer should be selected for the program. He should take photographs of the activities taking place in the dining room as well as during the presentation itself Copies of the photos should be given or made available to the recipient. Good contrast black and white prints can be sent to your local newspaper and to the Maine Mason magazine for inclusion with a small article telling about the recipient and his award. 5. ENTERTAINMENT. The main event for a Mason of the Year is the presentation of the award to the recipient. However, you should prearrange with several members of the Lodge and some of his friends to be present to talk about him. You might even roast him. Depending upon how long he has been in the community and a member of the lodge you might separate the speakers"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"into different time periods, his early high school days, recollections of his first days as a Master Mason, his involvement with his work, his activities on behalf of youth orders, his church or synagogue activities and of course what he has been doing for the Lodge. Unless you know the speakers personally, and whether or not they will be entertaining, you should ask them to speak five minutes each. There is nothing more boring than having to listen to someone drone on and on about past events. Sometimes, of course, you want more if the speaker is dynamic and funny. But it is always better to leave the audience wanting more than wishing they had never come. 6. MASTER OF CEREMONIES. The Master of Ceremonies should be dynamic and entertaining and someone that the lodge members look up to. If possible, he should know the recipient personally so that he can relate to the stories being told by the speakers. 7. DECORATIONS. The dining room as well as the lodge room should be decorated for the event. This presents another opportunity to involve additional members and their wives in the program. (If you have divided the speakers into different time periods, you might-use decorations that suggest these different periods in the recipient's life.) 8. SET UP AND CLEAN UP. The Stewards Committee should be used to set up and then after the program is over to clean up all of the tables and the dining room. This will reinforce the members with the feeling of helping the lodge and again give another committee something to do. 9. SERVERS. Call on one of your local Masonic Affiliated Youth Groups to help serve the dinner. In this way they will also feel a part of the program. NOTE: The Stewards should oversee the serving. 10. RESERVATIONS. It is suggested that reservations be taken for the dinner with a cut-off date one week prior to the event. In this way you will be able to correctly plan for the number of dinners required for the evening and the members will be making a coimnitment to attend the program. If you leave the cut-off date until the night of the program, you won't know how many dinners to prepare for. Worse than that, if something better comes along, TV show or football game, etc , your members won't feel committed to corning to the lodge program and will probably stay home or go to the game. The reservations should probably be handled by the Senior Steward. 11. MASON OF THE YEAR AWARD CERTIFICATE. The award selection committee should arrange for a certificate or placque. 12. AGENDA. The committee should put together an agenda for the evening. outlining the events that will take place, from the entrance of the lodge officers pnor to the dinner, to the presentation of the Award. A sample agenda follows: a) 6:30 PM - Entrance of Lodge Officers into the dining room. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"b) 6:35 PM - The Worshipful Master raps the audience up and asks the Chaplain to give an invocation. c) 6:40 PM - Dinner is served (head table is sewed first. It should be made up of the recipient, the Worshipful Master, the Master of Ceremonies, any visiting dignitaries and the Chaplain and their guests. The Wardens and any other officers can be added as room permits.) d) 7:30 PM - The Worshipful Master introduces the head table and the Lodge Officers. (This should be done in the dinning room coincident with the members and guests finishing their desserts. Just prior to the introduction of the lodge officers, he could introduce the Past Masters of the lodge, if he so desires.) e) 7:40 PM - The Worshipful Master invites everyone to adjourn to the lodge room where the rest of the program will take place. f) 8:00 PM - The Master of Ceremonies introduces the Worshipful Master who gives a short welcome to the members and their friends. (If you have a public address system, make sure that it is in good working order.) g) 8:05 PM - The Master of Ceremonies asks for the American Flag to be presented at the altar. This is another good place to use one of our Masonic Affiliated Youth Groups. The Flag is then placed in its proper place in the East. h) 8:10 PM - The Master of Ceremonies individually introduces each of the speakers for the evening and, as they are introduced invites them to come to the podium to speak. (You should have no more than six or seven speakers for this part of the program. Too many will drag the evening out.) i) 8:30 PM - The Master of Ceremonies introduces the Grand Lodge representatives (with a brief summary of fraternal background where appropriate). j) 9:00 PM - The Grand Lodge representative hands the framed certificate to the Worshipful Master who makes the presentation to the recipient. After the Master has presented the certificate to the recipient, he requests all previous recipients who are present to rise and be recognized. k) 9:10 PM - The Master then asks the recipient if he has any remarks that he would like to make. 1) 9:30 PM - After the remarks of the recipient, the Master thanks all the committees that made the evening possible and everyone for coming and then asks the Chaplain to give a benediction which closes the program. This procedure can be modified to accommodate any other programs that you want to put on. In place of the speakers for the evening substitute your entertainment. To make the evening less formal leave out the introduction of your Lodge Officers and the presentation of the flag or have a pot-luck in place of the special meal for the evening. Whatever you do remember the fii'e \"F's of planning: ** PRIOR PLANNING PREVENTS POOR PERFORMANCE ** "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"SECTION 15 HOW TO ORGANIZE LODGE ACTIVITIES A. ACT WITIES Activities are at the core of a successful lodge. If a member finds it interesting and enjoyable to attend lodge, no one will have to solicit his attendance. He will come because he wants to. Non-Masons should be encouraged to come to pubic lodge functions. Programs can be planned that will attract members as well as non-members. Every meeting of your lodge is, and should be, thought of as an activity. This is true whether it is a Stated Meeting, or a Special Meeting, such as an installation, a degree, a visit with another lodge, an official visit from a Grand Lodge officer, or a time set aside for a special activity or program. B. MASONIC EDUCATION Our Grand Lodge encourages Masonic Education. The Master should implement this by scheduling educational programs. Few men ever learned much about Masonry simply by taking degrees. The Research Lodges are able to give you much valuable assistance in this regard. It is hoped and expected that the Research Lodges will be able to stimulate a spirit of inquiry among lodge members throughout this Jurisdiction. Research means education, particularly Masonic Education, and you as Master should promote Masonic education in your Lodge. C. PLANNING AN ACTIVITY There are no hard and fast rules to follow when considering and planning an activity. For example, there may be times when your lodge may wish to limit attendance at an activity to Master Masons only; while at others, you may enthusiastically welcome friends and families who are non-Masons. Meetings and activities are most effective when planned and scheduled well in advance so as to encourage members to invite friends and neighbors. Be sure to get the word out so people can plan their schedules to include lodge functions. Create interest in coming events by using your trestleboard, mailers, announcements, reports at meetings, and your telephone committee. Unfortunately, many members don't read very much of the trestleboard, so one proven way of attracting their attention towards your coming event is to include an insert in the trestleboard highlighting the important features of the coming event. Not all activities need to be held at the Lodge. Some outstanding functions are held at an outside location - a railroad ride, a bus trip, a Ladies Night at a restaurant, or a picnic. Just to name a few. Be creative! Your local Chamber of Commerce can probably suggest many activities you never thought of. One approach to scheduling interesting activities is to survey the interests of your lodge members. Note their hobbies and don't overlook those members with interesting or unusual professions. Consider your own interests; if you are interested in a subject, chances are good that you will approach an activity related to that interest with enthusiasm. Remember that enthusiasm is contagious."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" D. SAMPLE PROGRAMS Some program suggestions for consideration are presented in the following list. These are general categories presented as suggestions for brain-storming sessions. From these general categories it is hoped that specific ideas will develop. Some of the suggestions may assist your Lodge in improving interest and attendance: others are listed for non- members to come into contact with the Lodge through your programs. Don't overlook the possibility of combining ideas. Some sample programs follow: Youth Night - join with the local DeMolay Chapter and go to a baseball game. Theater Night - Plan a theater party for family and friends and escort the widows. Movie Night - Show a major studio preview, slides from a members latest trip, studio \"out takes\", travelogues, etc. Grand Lodge NiTht - Invite a Grand Lodge officer to attend one of your meetings and have him speak on a subject familiar to him. Historical Site Visitation - Visit the Cornthin Hall at Grand Lodge, The Scottish Rite Museum at Lexington or some other historical site. Research Lodge Speakers - Masonic History, clandestine lodges, women in Masonry, the development of Masonry in Maine. Sports Events - Football, baseball and basketball games, visit your local high school, college or pro- team. Christmas/Hanukkah Party - Celebrate these holidays with your Masonic Affiliated Youth Groups, needy children or convalescent hospitals. Volunteer Work Parties for Lodge Visibility - Sekct a modest home needing clean-up and paint (perhaps a Masonic widow's home); clean up a local park, etc. Picnic - Encourage your members to bring their friends and neighbors. Potluck Dinners - Have them before your Family Night programs and invite your friends and neighbors. Note: theme dinners make the evening seem less ordinary. Mystery Trip - Pick a location and keep it a secret; if going by public transportation or chartered bus, don't tell anyone until you arrive; if going by private auto, you may want to have two or three rendezvous points where additional directions are distributed at each stop. Golf Tournament - Scotch \"eightsome\", include the ladies. Laymen's Night Program - Make sure that your members know to invite their non- Masonic friends and neighbors. Give them ample notice. Mason of the Year Award Take advantage of this night to also invite your non- Masonic friends and neighbors. Family Night Programs: Local school concert or play Barbershop quartets"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Shrine Bands, Chanters, or Shrine Club Visitations \"Oldies but Goodies\" program Public recognition for key people in the community Hopefully, this chapter has presented some ideas which will help you to start the task of planmng your programs. Many activities are available; only you can decide those that will best serve your lodge's needs. Naturally, a Handbook such as this cannot outline complete and detailed programs - nor should it. To do so would encourage a stereotyped set of activities among Lodges which would tend to dilute the richness of quality, unique to each Lodge. Pick and choose, use your Grand Lodge Committees or local library for other ideas, but most of all, THINK about programs which will help stimulate participation and interest in the Craft. Finally, let your District Officer and other Presiding Masters know of your progress. If you have other suggestions which should be included, or if you have tried something and it didn't work, let them know so they can benefit from your experience.

SECTION 17 HOW TO ORGANIZE A FELLOWSHIP NIGHT Men are often attracted to Masonry through a family member or friend, who is a Mason and whom they respect. Often they join as the basis of that"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"relationship alone, believing that some good men would only belong to a worthwhile institution. But what of the men who have no family connection or whose masonic friends are not good at explaining masonry or its purposes? This question has confronted many Masters who know that there are many men in his community who would make good Masons and who would join if they just knew more about it. For some men, many Masons feel uncertain about explaining the Craft to non-Masons. In response to this problem, Grand Master George Pulkkinen organized a series of Fellowship Nights with the purpo&e of explaining masonry to non- Masons. Over a period of time, he and R.W. Brian Paradis learned what appeals to non-Masons and developed a format that has been successful everywhere it has been used. Lodges or Districts are, of course, free to try something different. If you want something which is tried and true, and yields results, the formula on the attached sheets worked everywhere it has been used. TWELVE SIMPLE (Gut eoA~eltiae) STEPS rtnt M~UKInt GROWTH IN THE MASONiC FRATERNITY BY PLANNING AND EXECUTING A SUCCESSFUL FELLOWSHIP NIGHT Help Brethren realize they want/need to have candidates in their lodges to survive and grow and spread the good works of Freemasonry (Lodges must raise 5% of their base memberships every year for 20 years to replace the members of today who average 64 years old.) • Select a Lodge Membership Leader for each lodge. He must be a man who understands the need to raise 5% of the base membership annually. And he must be a man who gets things done. • Help the Brethren identify two friends/relatives they would like to share their Freemasonry with. Suggest they consider as prospects their sons, brothers, sons-in-law, cousins, the men they fish or golf or bowl with, or go to church with. Just two names because the Brethren have a responsibility to get these guests to the meeting, and two guests (plus their wives) is about all anyone can easily handle. Get the names and addresses of these two men on a guest sheet and make certain they get to the lodge Membership Leader. (Sheet attached.) 3. Choose a Fellowship Night date. (IT TAKES 8-10 WEEKS TO ADEQUATELY PREPARE!) Lodge Membership Leaders shotdd send invitations to guests selected to attend. All invitations for the same Fellowship Night should be mailed at the same time, about two weeks prior to the FbI. (Sample invitation attached.) 3. 3-4 days after invitations are mailed, each brother should contact his invited guests and tell them \"I'll be by to pick you (and your lady) up at 6 p.m.\" Then do it. We are inviting these guests to an evening of friendship. It's pretty unrealistic to expect a man to show up alone at a strange place. And it's not a very friendly thing to do, either. Remember, the guest doesn't know where the invitation came from until his friend -- our brother -- calls and tells him. 2-3 days before the Fellowship Night, the brother should call his invited guests again to remind them of the event and that he'll be by to pick them up."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" II.Fellowship Nights work well with 6:30 suppers followed by 7:30 meetings with everyone on the; way home by 9 p.m. 1..Program should be kept simple with a tight focus.

Attempts to talk about too much makes: for a confusing meeting with a garbled messagP. Part of the great beauty of Freemasonry is its simple, timeless truths. There's plenty of time to talk about our other parts later on. Remember!

You can request financial relief, in moderate amounts, from the Masonic Charitable Foundation. The first step is to get an application form. A copy is attached. The second step is to interview the recipient in order to obtain the information needed to complete the form. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" These are the things the Foundation looks for in evaluating an application and deciding on the appropriate level of relief: 1. Application. Your application will receive a quick response if you submit a complete application with all the blanks filled in and with bills reflecting the outstanding obligations. 2. A narrative. The Foundation has no independent means of evaluating an application. It is always helpful if you enclose a letter giving some background on the individual and his or her situation. 3. Participation by the Lodge. It is not required, but it adds credibility to your application to show how much the Lodge, itself, has done to relieve the distress of a Brother or his family member. 4. Negotiation. Many applications indicate obligations far in excess of the Foundation's ability to relieve. Many Lodges take a very active role in assisting a Brother to negotiate or compromise his obligations. In a recent case, a Brother had medical expenses in excess of $41,000.00. The Brother and his Lodge very skillfully negotiated this down to slightly more than $6,000.00 which he, his Lodge and our Foundation were able to pay in full. 5. Allocation. When the application is complete, the background information provided, all other sources tapped, and the obligation reduced as low as it can be, the Foundation can respond quickly taking into consideration the extent of funds available and the needs of other applicants.

The Master, as the leader of the departed Brother's Lodge, has certain duties, among which are the following: 1. Immediately call on the widow or family of the deceased Brother, and to express sympathy and condolences at the time of bereavement. 2. Offer the assistance of the officers and brethren of the Lodge. 3. Determine whether a Masonic Memorial Service is desired, or requested. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"4. Make certain that you or a fully qualified Brother is available to perform the Memorial Service. 5. Arrange attendance of officers and brethren at the Memorial Service. 6. Maintain contact with the widow, and render whatever assistance is requested during the period of adjustment, following the immediate period of bereavement. Keep the following points in mind in regard to the Memorial Service to insure the proper respect due to your departed Brother, his widow, your Lodge, and to Masonry in general. First, faithful discharge of the duties listed. Secondly, provide the best possible rendition of the Memorial Service. This is imperative, not only for the comfort provided to the family, but also for the good name of Freemasonry as exemplified on such occasion to the general public. Third, give consideration to the Service itself, maintaining an uninterrupted continuity from beginning to end; complying with any reasonable request of the family that is not inconsistent to our established customs and instructions; and cooperating with any clergyman performing a religious funeral service in conjunction with our Memorial Service. Fourth, make certain that the instructions contained within the Maine Masonic Textbook are fully complied with. Fifth, establish a Telephone Committee charged with contacting Brothers to attend. A good turnout of members is important. Sixth, be certain that a Lambskin Apron and twigs of Acacia are on hand for the Service and that white aprons, in sufficient number, are available for the Brethren attending. Seventh, if a eulogy is requested by the family to be a part of the Memorial Service, or it be deemed appropriate, be certain that the Brother to give the Eulogy is well informed and prepared to render it. A short eulogy is appropriate, when well done, as part of the Masonic Memorial Service. Eighth, keep in mind that there are two types of Services; namely, (1) the Funeral Service; and (2) the Evening Memorial Service. The Evening Memorial Service may be used as a graveside service. There are instructions that must be observed for each Service. The Funeral Service is used very rarely and only at the request of the family. APPENDIX A ROBERTS RULES OF ORDER (Simplified) Civilized society has, for the past five hundred years, recognized that adherence to a standardized process of conducting business provides the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"difference between chaos and order. For centuries, societies promulgated rules to govern their meeting process. From Parliamentary England came the rules of order which governed our first legislature, the House of Burgesses. Following the establishment of the United States Constitution, the Presiding Officer of the Senate, Vice President Thomas Jefferson, further refined the rules of order by writing his Manual Of Parliamentary Practice. This manual was adopted by both houses of Congress and the then existing state legislatures. Within a few decades, the organization of societies of various types - political, cultural, scientific, charitable, religious and fraternal - created a need for additional rules other than those utilized by legislatures. To meet this need, Luther S. Cushing, a clerk of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, wrote, in 1845, the Manual of Parliamentary Practice: Rules of Proceeding Debate in Deliberative Assemblies. In 1871, Major Henry M. Robert recognized that a comprehensive set of rules was required to govern societies at every level. Thus, Major Robert became convinced of the need for a new kind of parliamentary manual \"'based, in its general principles, upon rules arid practices of Congress, and adapted in its details, to the use of ordinary societies\". In 1876, Robert's Rules of Order was printed and, to this date, the revised editions provide the foundation for the manner in which we conduct the business of society, including the Masonic fraternity. The purpose of this section is to review briefly the proper rules of order for you to follow while conducting the important business of your Lodge. It would be impossible, for the purpose of this notebook, to cover completely everything contained in the 594 page Revised prior to ascending the Edition. However, each Lodge should maintain a copy and East, you should review the material so that you are familiar with its contents and can quickly reference applicable sections should the need arise. The following is a brief explanation of the basic rationale and principles which govern the manner in which you should govern your Lodge: 1. Protection for The Membership The rules of order are designed to protect the rights of the majority, the minority against the majority, each individual member, those absent from meetings and all the above groups together. 2. Pattern of Formality To insure peace and harmony among the brethren, it is vitally important for you to insist that all members of the Lodge, the Master included, adhere to strict guidelines in the use of the following formal modes of address and behavior: a. Always insist in the use of formal titles and the term \"Brethren\" when speaking within the Lodge. b. All members should only address the Master. If speaking to another, their comment should be conducted through the Master. c. To speak, a member must first rise, address the Master and be recognized before obtaining the floor. d. Follow the standardized order of business found in your Manual."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" e. Never allow the motives of another Brother to be addressed from the floor. Every Brother is to be considered honorable and seeking the best interests of the fraternity. When finished with one category of business, announce the next order of business so that the brethren can be aware of the flow of the meeting. You are Master of the Lodge and the pattern of formality is only governed by the manner in which you wield the gavel. Insist upon proper decorum and you will increase the peace and harmony that prevails within the temple. 4. Making a Motion It is important to remember that business can only be brought before the membership in the form of a motion unless it is a routine task such as reading the minutes of a previous meeting. The process of bringing business before the Lodge is as follows: a. A Brother must rise and obtain recognition from the Master. In the case of a committee report, the Brother is called upon by the Master to give his report. b.The Brother then makes a motion or makes his committee report and then a motion. In either case, he resumes his seat. Long or complicated motions should be in writing and then immediately forwarded to the Master. Also, a few words spoken in preparation, prior to making a motion, is appropriate, but allow no speeches and leave extensive comment to the debate. c.If the motion is inconsistent with the order of business, the Master should state: \"I declare the motion is out of order.\" Never state \"You are out of order or your motion is out of order\". d. The purpose of a second is to insure that time is not wasted when only one member is concerned about an issue. A second to the motion means that the issue should come before the Lodge. No specific recognition is required to make a second. Additionally, making a second only reflects the intention that the issue should come before the Lodge, not that another Brother favors the proposal. If no second is given,drop the motion and proceed to other business. e. When a motion and a second are completed, the Master repeats the motion calls for discussion, and then, after the debate has ended, asks \"Are you ready for the question?\" 5. Discussion or Debate The issue is now before the Lodge for debate and decision. If a Brother does not rise for recognition, proceed to vote. If a Brother rises for recognition, proceed with the debate utilizing the following procedures: a. The Brother who made the motion has first priority in debate. b. If two or more Brothers rise, the first standing has the right to be recognized. The Brother recognized has the floor and should not be interrupted unless he has violated the rules of order or proper decorum. He maintains the floor until seated. There is no prior claim to the floor by rising before the floor is yielded. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"c. If any modification to the motion is made, it must be made prior to the Master repeating the motion and asking \"Are you ready for the question?\" d. No Brother, except the mover of a question (who has the right to the last debate), should speak more than once. This rule may be dispensed with by the Master if he deems it proper to permit it. e. A speaker should confine his comments to the merits of the motion. He should only address his comments to the Master and not engage in personal attacks, allusions to the motives of others, or the mentioning of names. 17. The Master must, at all times, be fair and impartial. Make sure all sides are heard and attempt, as much as possible, to afford ample opportunity for both sides of the question, alternating the sides, if necessary. g. The Master may, at any time, speak. The Brother on the floor should sit down while the Master is speaking, unless his remarks are in the nature of a question directed to the Brother. The Master should not enter into the debate. However, if it appears necessary to do so, he should turn the meeting over to a Warden or a Past Master, leave the East and make his comment. h. The debate cannot be closed or the question moved, unless by special rule or a 2/3rd vote of those assembled, until all members have been afforded the opportunity to speak. i. There are other classes of motions that can be interjected at this point to assist in treating or disposing of a main motion. These will be discussed later in this chapter. 6. Voting After the debate has closed, the Master again asks \"Are you ready for the question?\" repeats the motion and calls for a vote. If there is any confusion or doubt as to the motion's intent the Master should explain the motion and describe the effect of both a yes and no vote. Utilize the following procedures for voting: a.The voting procedure in Masonic Lodges is usually by a show of hands, a voice vote or a rising vote. The only exceptions are votes on petitions for degrees, affiliation, restoration and an objection after initiation. Votes in these instances are by the ballot box. Also excepted are elections of officers with more than one candidate, when a written ballot should be used. b.The Master should call for the vote by saying All those in favor of the motion signify by raising your right hands. -Those opposed'. Always call for the no vote, no matter how overwhelming the affirmative vote. In this instance, the Master simply annoqnces the result of the vote. c.If a member rises to demand a standing vote, abide by the request unless the vote is obvious or the tactic is being utilized to delay the meeting. d.If a vote is not conclusive, then it is proper to have a standing vote. In announcing such results, state the number of votes for and against. e.The majority rules except when required by the Constitution, By-laws or the rules of order.
