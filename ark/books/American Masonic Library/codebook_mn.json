Recognized Masonry, Laws and Decisions SECTION G5.01 The Grand Lodge recognizes as Ancient Masonry only the degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason. (a) The Grand Lodge having in 1869 formally adopted the work and lectures of the degrees as then exemplified by its District Deputies in its presence, and as then amended, as the work and lectures of the Grand Lodge of Minnesota, said work and lectures are confirmed and re-adopted; and all Lodges of this Jurisdiction are required to conform thereto, save as to modifications which were then orally communicated and allowed and as since taught and exemplified by the Custodians of the work, and except as to the modification of the language of any charge or lecture thereof, to correspond with these regulations. The second section of the Second Degree lecture may be given at the discretion of the respective Lodge. (b) In the exemplification of the ritual, words shall be pronounced in accord with the pronunciation given in the latest edition of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.

At the Annual Communication of 1953 the Certified Cipher was adopted, repealing all prior resolutions concerning the Official Cipher. (d) In 1955, the Grand Lodge approved the printing and use thereof in separate pamphlet form for the convenience of officers, members and candidates, that portion of the work as is required to be committed to memory in all three degrees as it appears in the Official Cipher. The Master of each Lodge is responsible for the pamphlets and is required to account for them to the Board of Custodians when requested.

It is the duty of the Master, when a candidate has been raised that he be instructed in the proficiency of the Degree, that he pass a satisfactory examination of the same in open Lodge, and that he complete the educational program as soon as possible. SECTION G5.03 The Grand Lodge, in 1890, in order to preserve the harmony of the Craft, recognized and will continue to recognize as Masonic the following societies or organizations: The General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, together with the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of the State of Minnesota, and those Chapters and Bodies existing under and by virtue of its authority: the General Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters of the United States of America, together with the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters of the State of Minnesota, and those Councils and Bodies existing under and by virtue of its authority; the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar of the United States of America, together with the Grand Commandery of Knights Templar of the State of Minnesota, and those Commanderies and Bodies existing under and by virtue of its authority; the Supreme Council of the Thirty-third Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry of the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States of America, of which Venerable Brother Albert Pike was in 1890 the Sovereign Grand Commander, and its Subordinates, meaning all the Bodies existing under and by virtue of its authority; and as they so long have done in the past, without objections from the Grand Lodge, they may continue to adopt the first three (3) degrees of Masonry, namely, Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason, as the base upon which to erect their so-called higher degrees, and may, within their duly organized bodies, with the usual Masonic obligations and precautions to preserve the same, use so much of the esoteric ceremonies of said first three (3) degrees as may be necessary for the purpose. The Grand Lodge, from time to time, may recognize other societies or organizations as regular Masonic Bodies, and agree to their exercising the rights and benefits of regular Masonry. SECTION G5.04 In all cases of doubt as to any Masonic law or usage, application for the proper construction thereof should be made to the Grand Master only. SECTION G5.05 A decision should be made by the Grand Master upon controverted matter only, and his decision thereon governs the matter until disapproved by the Grand Lodge, having the force of interpretation of existing law only, and is not a law of itself. SECTION G5.06 An opinion given by the Grand Master as to the law upon a question submitted without controversy is not a decision; if given to a Lodge or its Master, it is official to that extent only and should be reported to the Grand Lodge by the Grand Master. If given to anyone else, it is unofficial and should not be reported. SECTION G5.07 No ruling of the Grand Master shall remain in force and effect after the expiration of one (1) year after the conclusion of the term of office of the Grand Master making such ruling, unless the Jurisprudence Committee of the Grand Lodge shall deem such ruling to be of interpretive value and such committee consequently orders such ruling to be preserved as an annotation under the specific Section or sections of the Grand Lodge Constitution or the General Regulations pursuant to which it was made. SECTION G5.08 Brethren who have held the office of Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, Grand Warden, Master or Warden to the end of their terms for which installed respectively are recognized as possessing honors in Masonry, according to such past rank. The taking of a demit by such a Brother possessing honors does not extinguish them, except that the same shall be in abeyance pending his affiliation in this Jurisdiction. 37 GENERAL REGULATIONS April 5, 2003"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"If a permanent member of the Grand Lodge takes a demit, his membership in the Grand Lodge is suspended pending his affiliation with another Lodge in this Jurisdiction.

Unmasonic Conduct SECTION G6.01 A Lodge has the power, and it is its duty, to discipline any member thereof, wherever he may reside, for any unmasonic conduct he may have committed anywhere. SECTION G6.02 It also has the power, and it is its duty, to exercise the same power over any other Mason whether affiliated or not, a resident of, or sojourning in its territorial jurisdiction, for unmasonic conduct occurring in that jurisdiction, unless he is a member of another Lodge having concurrent jurisdiction, in which case his own Lodge must discipline him. Between Lodges of concurrent jurisdiction, the Lodge first receiving charges of unmasonic conduct against a Mason of another jurisdiction, resident of, or sojourner, has exclusive right and should see that he is tried thereon. When such charges are filed against any officer of a Lodge for clearly scandalous conduct, bringing the Fraternity into disrepute, the Grand Master should arrest the jewel of such an officer and suspend him from exercising the duties of his office, pending trial. SECTION G6.03 Beside violation of Section C8.01, of the Constitution, the following specific acts shall be deemed unmasonic conduct and shall render the offender subject to discipline. (a) To improperly solicit the petition of a profane for the degrees of Masonry before he shall have clearly indicated some interest in Freemasonry. Proper solicitation shall consist of the following: A man of sterling qualities may be approached and informed, but only once. He must be left to make his own decision. He should not be badgered. (b) To ask or solicit an Entered Apprentice or Fellowcraft to apply for the degrees of any organization recognized by the Grand Lodge until he is a Master Mason. (c) To talk about or discuss degree work in the presence of a non-mason. (d) To discuss the character or the merits or demerits of a petitioner, either for degrees or membership, in a Lodge convened or, after rejection, to express regret at the action taken, or how he or anyone voted upon the ballot. A violation of paragraph (d) shall require immediate charges filed with the Master and, if found guilty, the penalty shall be expulsion and no other.

(g) To place in the hands of a candidate for the purpose of instruction any cipher or key to the degrees except such as is specifically authorized by the Grand Lodge. (h) To use the word \"Mason,\" \"Masonic\" or \"Freemason,\" or any emblem of Blue Lodge Masonry as a part of a business name, or in business advertising of any kind; to say or infer in any publication that the same is published or recognized by Masonry as a Masonic publication unless authority to state that: \"This publication is issued with the permission of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge A.F. and A.M. of Minnesota,\" has been expressly given by the Grand Lodge. No Master Mason shall solicit, accept, prepare or submit advertising to be placed in any magazine, pamphlet or other publication which is violating the provisions hereof and shall be deemed guilty of unmasonic conduct for so doing. No Master Mason shall become a policy holder in any insurance company using Masonic words or emblems either in its name, its policies or in its advertising.

(l) To defame the character of a Mason, by printing or otherwise, and to use insulting, libelous or profane language of, or to, any Brother of the Masonic Fraternity.

Trial Commission SECTION G7.01 In every case where charges are filed for unmasonic conduct the procedure prescribed in this Article shall be substantially followed; and except for failure to pay dues, contempts and neglect or refusal to obey a Lodge summons, no penalty shall be imposed without formal and specified charges against, notice to, investigation and trial of the Brother accused. SECTION G7.02 Makeup of Trial Commission (a) The tribunal for such trial, if the jurisdiction of the charge lies in and is made to a Lodge, shall be a Trial Commission consisting of three (3) Past Masters, of which one (1), whenever possible, shall be an attorney-at-law, who shall all be members in good standing in a district or districts other than that in which such charges are filed. (b) The Grand Master upon installation shall divide the State into regions and, as soon as practical thereafter, he shall, and with the advice of the Committee on Jurisprudence, appoint Past Masters as Trial Commissioners, one (1) from each region into which the State was divided, to serve as such for one (1) year or until their successors are appointed. A Chief Trial Commissioner shall be designated by the Grand Master from among those appointed, who shall serve as such Chief Trial Commissioner at the will and pleasure of the Grand Master. It shall be his duty to organize the Trial Commissioners, assign cases and instruct them in their duties. In like manner and for like terms the Grand Master may appoint alternate Trial Commissioners for any or all Trial Commissioners. From such Trial Commissioners or alternates the Chief Trial Commissioner shall select three (3) to serve as a Trial Commission in a given case, none of whom shall be a relative of the accuser or accused, nor of any person directly interested in the case, nor shall they be members of the same Lodge as any of the above. A Trial Commission once appointed shall retain jurisdiction until the matter has been adjudicated or until the Grand Master or a subsequent Grand Master shall appoint a new Trial Commission. (c) The Chief Trial Commissioner shall name one of the Commissioners so appointed as chairman, who shall preside at the trial and hearings; and the Commission shall select its own Secretary. The Commission must keep accurate minutes of all proceedings from the time of appointment until it reports its findings and judgment, including the testimony, when proper to be written, and other evidence offered or filed with it, substantially according to the form provided in these regulations. Any witness having testimony not proper to be written, who cannot be at the trial to give it orally, may testify orally before a member of the Commission, who will then testify at such trial what such omitted testimony disclosed and, in case of appeal, repeat it before the Committee on Appeals and Grievances. SECTION G7.03 If unmasonic conduct occurs while the Lodge is at labor, it may be dealt with summarily; or the Master may direct the Senior Warden to prepare and file formal charges against the alleged offender, to be tried in the regular manner. SECTION G7.04 If unmasonic conduct occurs during \"refreshment\" (the interval between communications of a Lodge) any member cognizant thereof may file formal charges or may bring the matter to the attention of the Master, whose duty will be to direct the Junior Warden to investigate and, if proper, to file formal charges against the alleged offender. SECTION G7.05 If the alleged unmasonic conduct is against a member of a Lodge other than that of the complainant, the latter should bring it to the attention of the Master of the alleged offender's Lodge; it shall then be the duty of the Master so notified to direct the Junior Warden of his Lodge to investigate and, if proper, to file formal charges against the alleged offender. SECTION G7.06 If any Warden who has been directed to prepare and file charges against an alleged offender fails, neglects or refuses to do so promptly, the Master shall appoint some other qualified member to prepare them.

The Grand Lodge has exclusive jurisdiction over charges involving unmasonic or official misconduct of any of its own members, and concurrent jurisdiction with its Constituent Lodges over all charges of unmasonic conduct upon the part of all other Masons. SECTION G7.08 All formal charges must be in writing (if Masonically proper to be written) and state for \"unmasonic conduct\" and particularly specify the conduct, offense or violation complained of, and shall also state the time, place and circumstances thereof, and shall be signed by the member making the charge, who shall be known as the \"accuser.\" The name of the member against whom the charge is made shall also be given, and he shall be known as the \"accused.\" Such charges must be filed with the Secretary of the Lodge of which the accuser is a member, the original to be retained in his office and the Master notified at once of the fact. The Secretary shall forthwith send one (1) copy to the Grand Master, who shall decide as to form and content and, if proved, would constitute unmasonic conduct, he shall so notify the Secretary who shall at the next Stated Communication read such charges to the Lodge, enter them upon the minutes of that communication and notify the Grand Master that he has done so, as well as any Lodge which might have had jurisdiction, that charges have been filed against the accused. Should the Grand Master decide that the charges are not in proper form, he shall return them to the Secretary for correction as he may indicate, and when so made they shall again be sent to the Grand Master. Should the Grand Master decide that the charges do not constitute unmasonic conduct, he shall dismiss them, notify the Secretary of such dismissal, who in turn shall notify the accuser that the charges have been dismissed by the Grand Master and his grounds therefor, and enter in the minutes of the next Stated Communication such dismissal. SECTION G7.09 The accuser may withdraw his charges only with the consent of the Lodge, and then before the taking of evidence begins. In such case, the Secretary's record should show that the accused is hence free of such charges, because withdrawn. A withdrawal of charges does not preclude a refiling of another charge for the same offense, when the accused has never been actually tried. SECTION G7.10 Upon the appointment of a Trial Commission, the Grand Master shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Lodge in which charges are filed, the names of the members thereof, who in turn will promptly notify the accused in writing, who will be allowed ten (10) days in which to file an objection of prejudice with the Grand Master; and if none is filed, the Commission shall proceed, the Grand Master giving his copy of the charges to the Chairman of the Commission, and the Secretary of the Lodge in question mailing his second copy to the accused. SECTION G7.11 The Trial Commission acquires jurisdiction immediately upon its appointment by the Chief Trial Commissioner, and its first duty shall be the sending of a summons to the accuser, the accused and all witnesses at least ten (10) days before the date set for trial, if the accused resides locally; twenty (20) days if the accused is within the State of Minnesota, but in a different town from where the trial is set; thirty (30) days if the accused is outside the State of Minnesota, but within the United States; and ninety (90) days if the accused is in a foreign country. Such notices shall be by registered mail and a receipt card shall constitute proof of service. The Trial Commission has full power and authority to hear, try and determine the guilt or innocence of the accused upon the charges filed against him and, if found guilty, to fix the penalty. Said Commission shall be the sole judge as to evidence or objection to evidence offered. 41 GENERAL REGULATIONS April 5, 2003"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The accuser and accused may appear with or without counsel, such counsel being Master Masons, in good standing, belonging to this Grand Jurisdiction. Strict and technical rules shall not be insisted upon in such trials, the aim and purpose being to ascertain the true and relevant facts concerning the charges. The testimony of a witness shall not be impeached by that of another witness to the effect that he would not believe that of an earlier witness given under oath, but any witness may give testimony contradictory to that of another. All witnesses who are Masons shall affirm that their testimony is given on their honor as Masons. Witnesses who are not Masons shall be sworn to tell the truth before an official qualified to administer an oath. All witnesses shall sign their names to their testimony, which shall be recorded and transcribed. The Grand Master, the accuser and the accused with their respective counsel, the witness being examined and a reporter, if necessary, shall be the only ones present during the taking of evidence by the Commission. If the reporter is not a Mason, care should be taken when testimony touching esoteric matters is offered and be excluded if necessary. A Masonic summons is a call of authority, and failure to obey is cause for punishment, unless excused for a reason, such as a critical illness of one's self or family; such business necessity as shall appear reasonable; or absence from the Jurisdiction. The testimony of a witness may be given in the form of a deposition, upon order from the Trial Commission to some Master or Warden of a Lodge near such witness, authorizing him to take and certify to the testimony given. For such purpose interrogatories and cross-interrogatories shall be prepared on behalf of the accuser and accused and sent to such Master or Warden, who shall secure the answers, have them signed in his presence and returned to the Commission with a certification that they are true answers made by such witness. SECTION G7.12 Whenever charges are based upon a conviction of the accused by a State or Federal Court of competent jurisdiction for a crime which is a felony, a court certified copy of the final judgment of conviction entered therein and the sentence imposed thereon shall be supplied by the accuser and shall be conclusive evidence of the crime of which the accused was convicted and the accused shall be notified in writing accordingly. Such cases will be heard by a single Trial Commissioner. The accused shall be given twenty (20) days after the mailing of said notice to forward to the Trial Commissioner any written statement or evidence in explanation of or in mitigation of the offense of which he stands convicted. The Trial Commissioner or one of the Trial Commissioners appointed by him, on the certified record of conviction and the accused's response thereto, shall determine with the approval of the Grand Master the penalty which shall be imposed on the accused under the provisions of Section G7.13 of the General Regulations. On other charges, including misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, involving moral turpitude, on a conviction of the accused by a State or Federal Court as defined above, however, a Masonic trial shall be held in the hall of the Lodge in which the charges are filed, and behind tiled doors at a time fixed in the notice, and the Trial Commission shall ask the accused if he is willing to admit his guilt and, if he does so, may upon such confession and admission fix the penalty as hereinafter provided. If the accused does not admit his guilt the Commission will then proceed to take the evidence produced by the accuser to substantiate his charges, and thereafter the evidence of the accused in defense of, or in mitigation of the offense charged. Witnesses need not be Masons to give testimony material to the charges, but it is the duty of any Mason having knowledge of any fact pertinent to the charges to be a witness. When the charges of unmasonic conduct are filed as a result of a conviction of the accused by a State or Federal Court of competent jurisdiction for a crime which is a felony or involves moral turpitude, the accused shall be suspended from all of the rights and privileges of Masonry, subject to a decision of an appeal, if an appeal be taken.

When a Trial Commission has arrived at its conclusions, a transcript of all testimony taken and all exhibits and documentary evidence received and considered in connection with the case will be transmitted to the Chief Trial Commissioner, who will notify the Grand Master of the findings. The accused, if convicted, shall be notified by the Chief Trial Commissioner of said conviction and penalty and his rights of appeal.

SECTION G8.02 At such Stated Communication the Master of the Lodge shall order the offending Brother to show cause why he should not be punished for such contempt, by vote of the Lodge then assembled. Such order of the Master shall constitute the charge against him and shall be entered in the minutes by the Secretary, together with the offender's oral answer, if any. The offending Brother shall be allowed to make such explanation as he desires and shall then be required to retire from the Lodge hall and await the action of the Lodge, by vote. If found guilty, the Lodge shall fix the penalty-not exceeding suspension for a limited time. Lodge voting shall be by the voting sign of a Mason. SECTION G8.03 If any member of a Lodge fails or refuses to obey a summons, the Master shall order the offending Brother to show cause why he should not be punished for such disobedience, as for a contempt, except for such excuse as is provided in General Regulations Section G7.11; and Section G8.02 shall govern the procedure.

The accused shall be notified promptly by the Secretary, under the seal of the Lodge, of such Lodge action. SECTION G8.05 Any member whose dues are not paid within one (1) year after they are due and payable shall be deemed delinquent, and his name shall be stricken from the roll of the Lodge, unless there is a good reason, in the following manner: (a) At the first Stated Communication of the Lodge held four (4) months after any member becomes delinquent, notice shall be given that at a subsequent Stated Communication named in the notice, a motion will be made to strike from the roll the delinquent member or members, naming him or them, for failure to pay the dues therein stated. (b) On the day following the communication at which such notice is given, the Secretary shall notify the member by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at his last known address, of the amount of his delinquent dues and that at the communication named in the notice a motion will be made to strike his name from the roll. Such registered or certified letter shall constitute proof of service. If a member's address in unknown, no notice need be sent. (c) At the communication named in the notice, the Lodge shall strike the name, or names, from the roll, unless payment of delinquent dues has been made; and such member shall thereafter be known as an Unaffiliated Mason, with no further Masonic rights or privileges, except to pay everything necessary to make him clear on the books of the Lodge. Upon such payment he becomes a Nonaffiliated Mason and may petition his old Lodge for restoration or any other Lodge for affiliation. (d) Any action striking a member from the rolls, without notice, is void; and when such fact is discovered, upon payment by the member of the amount for which he was illegally stricken, the Master shall order his name restored to the rolls without formal petition to, or vote by, the Lodge.

The Master must arrest such jewel upon an order from the Grand Master. The Grand Lodge may punish summarily for a contempt, any offense committed in its presence by any member in attendance. The effect of arresting a jewel of an officer is to suspend him from exercising the functions of his office until the jewel is restored, but does not otherwise affect his rights as a Mason. SECTION G8.11 An officer whose jewel is arrested is entitled to have the matter reviewed on appeal to the Grand Lodge, whether or not the term of office of the officer affected expires in the meantime. The matter will be heard before the Committee on Appeals and Grievances, and final action taken by the Grand Lodge upon the Committee's report thereon.

SECTION G9.08 A Brother stricken by his Lodge for non-payment of dues may be restored to membership by majority vote of the Lodge, without re-petitioning or investigation if within a year of being stricken he pays everything necessary to make him clear on the books of his Lodge. If after one year he wishes to be restored to membership it will be necessary that he petition the Lodge for restoration, after having paid everything necessary to make him clear on the books of the Lodge.

It shall show the petitioner's age to be no less than eighteen (18) years. It shall be signed with the full name of the petitioner and must be recommended by two Master Masons in good standing, at least one of which must be a member of the of the Lodge petitioned and the other may be a member in good standing of a Lodge recognized by this Grand Lodge.

SECTION G14.02 A petition for plural membership or for affiliation shall show the petitioner to be a Master Mason, and be accompanied by either a demit, a certificate of non-affiliation or a certificate of good standing as defined by these General Regulations, that he is not then under any sentence of suspension or expulsion and knows of no reason why he should be; that, with a full recognition of the duties and responsibility of membership, he desires affiliation with the Lodge petitioned and promises, if accepted, to conform to the requirements of its by-laws and all usages and customs of the Fraternity.

A petitioner for affiliation or plural membership need not be a resident of the State of Minnesota. SECTION G14.03 A petition for reinstatement or restoration shall require the same information as for affiliation, with such additional facts as will show the present status of the petitioner. 57 GENERAL REGULATIONS April 5, 2003"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"SECTION G14.04 All petitions, whether for degrees, affiliation, reinstatement or restoration, if in proper form, shall be read at a Stated Communication and referred by the Master to a committee of three (3) members of the Lodge, whose names shall not be made known nor recorded in the minutes, nor read with the report. Except the Lodge may, by majority vote, on an individual basis, waive the requirement of referring a Petition to a committee of three (3) members for investigation. However, if the requirement for such an investigation is waived, the petition may not be voted upon until the first Stated Communication after its initial reading. This committee must not be a standing committee of the Lodge nor referred to as the usual committee for investigation; their duty is to make a careful investigation of the statements in the petition, particularly to determine whether the Lodge has jurisdiction over the petitioner, and ascertain as to his moral, intellectual, social and physical qualifications, and to report in writing in accordance with the form provided in the Code, on the blanks sold by the Grand Secretary, at the next Stated Communication, unless further time is granted. The Master, in his discretion, may discharge an investigating committee or any member thereof for failure to report and appoint a new committee or another member thereof. No member of the committee can withdraw his report after filing the same with the Secretary. The original petition shall always remain in possession of the Secretary. Petitions for degrees or affiliation received by a Lodge having concurrent jurisdiction with another Lodge and holding more than one (1) Stated Communication in each month shall not be balloted upon until after one (1) Stated Communication of the Lodge has been held; and in such cases the report of the investigating committee cannot be read until such second Stated Communication. When Lodges hold but one (1) Stated Communication during the summer months, the ballot must be postponed until the second Stated Communication after such petition has been received. SECTION G14.05 While each Lodge subject to the limitations imposed by Masonic law and usage is the judge of the character and qualifications of those who apply to it for degrees or membership, yet it is the privilege of any other Lodge, upon request of a member thereof, to file an objection, stating the reasons therefor, to the acceptance of, or conferring the degrees on, a petitioner. Such objection shall be mailed to the Master of the Lodge petitioned by the Master of the Lodge to which the Brother objecting belongs. The Master of the Lodge petitioned shall in turn make known the objection to the Committee on Investigation, if not already reported. If the committee has reported and the petitioner accepted, the same course shall be followed in all respects as if a similar objection had been filed by a member of the electing Lodge, and the petitioner stopped \"by objection,\" or his advancement stopped \"by charges.\" SECTION G14.06 A Lodge may receive the report of a majority of the investigating committee, by a vote by the usual sign, but it may also vote to insist upon a report of the full committee, and grant further time. When the report is received the committee is discharged and no record of the character of its report shall be made in the minutes. The petitioner must be given the benefit of the ballot, without discussion, immediately following the committee report, whereupon the report is destroyed. Ballots elect to all degrees; every member present must vote, and each petition must be balloted upon separately. When the Master has examined the ballot box, he shall empty it of the ballots before announcing the result. SECTION G14.07 After a petitioner for degrees has been elected by unanimous ballot of the Lodge, he is entitled to receive them at the reasonable will and pleasure of the Master, and as early as permissible.

SECTION G14.08 A petitioner can be initiated in the regular way as an Entered Apprentice, the same night he is elected. A non-affiliate holding a demit from a Lodge in this Jurisdiction, who is again elected to membership, whether in the Lodge from which he demitted or another, receives a new Lodge number, but not a new Grand Lodge number. If he comes from another Grand Jurisdiction, he takes both a new Lodge and Grand Lodge number. No ballot upon a petition can be reconsidered or reopened, except that one (1) additional ballot is allowed at the discretion of the Master in accordance with Section C9.11 of the Grand Lodge Constitution. An elected petitioner for degrees must present himself within one (1) year after his notification of election, or he must file a new petition which must take the same course as the original. The Lodge may, for good cause, grant the petitioner additional time; and the minutes shall show such extension, otherwise he cannot have the Entered Apprentice degree conferred upon him by courtesy. An Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft Brother who has been duly notified to present himself to receive the succeeding degree and who fails so to present himself within one (1) year after such due notice shall be notified by certified or registered mail that if he does not appear within three (3) months from the date of notice his rights to receive the succeeding degree or degrees will be terminated, unless he can show just cause why he is unable to appear for such degree. The Lodge may grant him additional time for cause shown, which shall be recorded in the minutes of the Lodge. An Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft Brother thus dropped may petition to continue on with the degrees by petitioning the Lodge which terminated his degree work. The Fellow Craft or Master Mason degree fee must accompany such said petition, which shall be investigated and balloted upon as required in Section C9.11 of the Grand Lodge Constitution. If such petition be rejected, the Fellow Craft fee or the Master Mason fee shall be returned to the petitioner, along with notice of the rejection. Any petitioner whose petition is rejected must wait not less than six (6) months before he may petition again. SECTION G14.09 Any form of petition, legally received, may be withdrawn by written request of the petitioner, signed by him. It is not necessary that he state his reason for asking that it be withdrawn. Masonry is a voluntary institution. SECTION G14.10 At any time after six (6) months from rejection, a petitioner for degrees may file a new petition with any Lodge having Jurisdiction. A rejected petitioner for plural membership, affiliation, reinstatement or restoration may petition again at any time, and for affiliation, he may present it to any Lodge anywhere. When a petitioner is rejected, he shall be informed thereof in writing by the Secretary, and any money paid for degrees shall be returned, and his demit or certificate which accompanied his petition likewise returned. The Secretary shall also notify all Lodges which were entitled to receive notice of the receipt of the petition, as per Section C9.07(a) of the Constitution, of the petitioner's rejection. Wherever the word petition or petitioner is used in this article the same shall mean for the degrees or affiliation. Any and all Regulations of the Grand Lodge, if any, inconsistent with the Constitution of the Grand Lodge governing the receipt of petitions for the degrees or affiliation are not effective. SECTION G14.11 When a petition is received from one who has been rejected by another Lodge, the rejecting Lodge or Lodges must be notified thereof by the Secretary of the Lodge receiving the petition. 59 GENERAL REGULATIONS April 5, 2003"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Such notice shall be sent in time to reach the rejecting Lodge or Lodges before their next Stated Communication, and sufficient time given thereafter for a reply. No report from the investigating committee shall be received and no action taken by the Lodge petitioned until after sufficient time for the rejecting Lodge or Lodges to make reply has elapsed. SECTION G14.12 When it is discovered that a petition has been illegally received, all unfinished work must be stopped at once. The Lodge shall notify the petitioner and return all fees collected. It shall also notify all Lodges having concurrent jurisdiction of its action and furnish a certificate to the petitioner, under the seal of the Lodge, with which he makes a new petition to the Lodge having jurisdiction. Upon election by such Lodge he may be \"healed\" as to degrees received, and upon receiving the Master Mason's degree become a member of such Lodge. SECTION G14.13 Residence, as applied to the question of eligibility to petition for degrees, means the permanent fixed abode of the petitioner which, named from choice, he calls his home. It may be with his family, where he votes or with his parents. A person not having such fixed and sufficient residence, either because of length of time or because his movements are too unsettled and uncertain, is not eligible to petition. An unmarried man cannot claim residence with his parents if he has voted elsewhere, unless he returns to them for a year. SECTION G14.14 A petitioner who is eligible as to residence when he files his petition does not lose such eligibility by subsequently changing his address. One who accepts an appointment under the United States government, which necessitates his removal for an indefinite period from his old place of residence to another, loses such former residence; he must become eligible in his new residence or, if he subsequently moves back to his old residence, must wait ninety (90) days before he petitions. SECTION G14.15 The degrees of Symbolic Masonry, or Blue Lodge degrees, can never be communicated nor abbreviated; provided that the dramatic portion of the Master Mason's degree may be shortened upon all but the last candidate. In all degrees the lectures must be given in full. SECTION G14.16 A petitioner for the degrees, elected in a foreign Jurisdiction, who removes to this Jurisdiction before receiving any or all the degrees may, after ninety (90) days residence in this Jurisdiction and upon presenting the consent and waiver of the Lodge which first elected him, under the seal and over the signature of the Master and Secretary, petition a Lodge in the Jurisdiction in which he now resides for the degree or degrees not yet received; and if elected, shall upon receiving the Master Mason degree become a member thereof. SECTION G14.17 All fees received by a Lodge conferring any of the degrees, at the request of another Lodge, must be forwarded to the requesting Lodge unless it directs otherwise. SECTION G14.18 The posting or coaching of a candidate of one Lodge by a Master Mason of another Lodge is permitted with the consent of the Masters of both Lodges. SECTION G14.19 A Master Mason, who is a member of a Lodge in a Jurisdiction which does not allow demission, nor issue certificates of good standing, until after such member has petitioned and been elected to membership in another Lodge, may petition for affiliation in this Jurisdiction, accompanied by a receipt for current dues and stating in his petition the law as to demits and certificates of good standing existing in the Jurisdiction to which he belongs. Upon election, the Secretary of the Lodge electing shall certify the facts to the Lodge in which he holds membership, accompanied with a request for a demit; and, when received, the Secretary shall announce that such Brother is now a member upon previous election and the receipt of his demit.

Any violation of the above having occurred, the Grand Master may rescind the permission and authority given by him. SECTION S1.19 Freemasonry and Religion Basic Principles . Freemasonry is not a religion, nor is it a substitute for religion. It requires of its members belief in a God as part of the obligation of every responsible adult, but advocates no sectarian faith or practice. Masonic ceremonies include prayers, both traditional and extempore, to reaffirm each individual’s dependence on a supreme being and to seek divine guidance. Freemasonry is open to men of any faith, but religion may not be discussed at Masonic meetings. The Supreme Being. Masons believe that there is one God and that people employ many different ways to seek, and to express what they know of, God. Masonry primarily uses the appellation, “Grand Architect of the Universe, “ and other non-sectarian titles, to address Deity. In this way, persons of different faiths may join together in prayer, concentrating on a Supreme Being, rather than differences among themselves. Masonry believes in religious freedom and that the relationship between the individual and God is personal, private, and sacred. Volume of the Sacred Law. An open volume of the Sacred Law, “the rule and guide of life,” is an essential part of every Masonic meeting, The Volume of the Sacred Law to a Christian is the Bible; to Freemasons of other faiths, it is the book held holy by them. The Oath of Freemasonry. The obligations taken by Freemasons are sworn on the volume of the Sacred Law. They are undertakings to follow the principles of Freemasonry and to keep confidential a Freemason’s means of recognition. The much-discussed “penalties,” judicial remnants from an earlier era, are symbolic, not literal. They refer only to the pain any honest man should feel at the thought of violating his word. Freemasonry Compared with Religion. Freemasonry lacks the basic elements of religion. (a) It has no dogma or theology, no wish or means to enforce religious orthodoxy. (b) It offers no sacraments. (c) It does not claim to lead to salvation by works, by secret knowledge, or by any other means. The secrets of Freemasonry are concerned with modes of recognition, not with the means of salvation. Freemasonry Supports Religion. Freemasonry is far from indifferent toward religion. Without interfering in religious practice, it expects each member to follow his own faith and to place his Duty to God above all other duties. Its moral teaching are acceptable to all religions.
