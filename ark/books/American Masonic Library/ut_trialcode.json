GRAND LODGE of FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS OF UTAH As approved by Grand Lodge at the Annual Communicat ion of January 22 and 23, 1951. The symbol (*) is shown immediately following the t itle of each Section that has been revised or added to. SECTION 200. MASONIC OFFENSES. (*) Masonic Offenses are defined to be: First: A violation of the laws of the United State s, or of the State in which the offender may reside or be, invol ving commission of a felony or other offense involving moral turpit ude. Second: Willful violation of the offender’s obliga tions as a Mason, of the Constitution or laws of Grand Lodge o r of the by-laws of the Lodge in which the offender holds membership . Third: Any other act which tends to impair the sta nding or reputation of the Fraternity before the world. Fourth: Any misrepresentation made for the purpose of obtaining the degrees of Freemasonry. SECTION 201. JURISDICTION OF OFFENSES. (a) Every Lodge has jurisdiction over its own members wheresoever dispersed. If the accused is a member of a Lodge of this Jurisdiction, the charges shall be sent to that Lod ge for trial; but if the Lodge waives its right, or refuses or fails to ente rtain said charges at the next regular meeting thereof, the Lodge within whose jurisdiction the alleged offense was committed shall entertain s aid charges and proceed in the premises as in this Trial Code provi ded. 2 (b) Every Lodge has jurisdiction over all non-affil iated and sojourning Masons residing, or charged with com mitting a Masonic offense, within its jurisdiction. If the a ccused is such a Mason, charges may be preferred either in any Lodge having jurisdiction over the place of such residence or so journ, or in any Lodge within whose jurisdiction the alleged offense took place; and the Lodge in which such charges are first filed sha ll have exclusive jurisdiction in the premises. Whenever the attenti on of the Grand Secretary shall be called to any Masonic offense co mmitted by any non-affiliated or sojourning Mason, the same shall be referred to the Grand Master of his action thereon. SECTION 202. PROCEDURE Whenever a Mason is charged with any Masonic offens e, the proceedings in the premises shall be conducted subs tantially in accordance with the rules and procedure in the Tria l Code provided. SECTION 203. CHARGES, HOW PREFERRED. (*) (a) If a Masonic offense be committed without the Lodge, or when the Lodge is not in session or at la bor, charges against the offender may be preferred by any Master Mason or Master Masons. If no other accuser makes charges, and it be brought to his attention that there is probable cause to believe t hat a Masonic offense had been committed, it shall be the duty of the Junior Warden to prefer charges. (b) If any Masonic offense be committed in the Lodge while in session or at labor, the Master may direct the filing of charges, or may summarily dispose of the offense by requiring the offender to show cause why he should not be dealt w ith by the Lodge without further delay. In the latter case, he shal l cause the alleged offender to stand, shall state to him the nature of the offense charged against him, and by whom preferred, and permit him to offer such extenuation or excuse for his conduct as he may wis h to make. If the accused denies the charge, and demands trial, charg es shall be filed and the matter disposed of as herein otherwise prov ided. On any such summary disposal of such matter, the offender may b e barred from further attendance at the meeting, suffer reprimand or such other punishment, short of suspension, expulsion or fine, as the Master may impose with the approval of a majority of the membe rs present."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 (c) Proceedings against the Master of Lodge may be taken only in the manner thereinafter provided. SECTION 204. FORM AND FILING OF CHARGES. (*) All charges of Masonic offenses, except those commi tted in open Lodge, shall be in writing and signed by the a ccuser, shall specify with common certainty the nature of the act or acts charged as constituting the offense, and state the time and pl ace where the same was committed. Such charges shall be filed with th e Master or the Secretary. The Master in any case shall examine th e charges before further action thereon, and may, if he deems them i nsufficient to state a Masonic offense or wanting in certainty, return t hem to the accuser or accusers for amendment, if such be possible, to correct such defect. Upon his determining that the charges as filed, or amended state a Masonic offense and are sufficiently specific to in form the Lodge and the accused of the nature and details of the offens e charged, the charges shall be filed with the Secretary, and they shall be read by him at the next regular meeting of such Lodge, and entered in full upon its minutes. Notice shall be given all member s of the Lodge by the Secretary that election of a Trial Commission t o hear and act upon such charges will take place at the next regular me eting. SECTION 205. TRIAL COMMISSION. (*) Trial of any such charges shall be by a Trial Commi ssion, consisting of five members of the Lodge in good sta nding, who shall be elected by a written ballot and by a majority vo te of those present, at the next regular meeting of the Lodge following the reading of such charges. The elective officers and the member s of the Committee on Grievance and Appeals of Grand Lodge, the Master, Junior Warden, and Secretary of the Lodge, the accu ser or accusers, the persons designated by the Master to act as pros ecuting attorney and defense counsel and any person who may be known to have such knowledge of the facts respecting the charges as to qualify him as a witness, shall not be eligible to sit on such Trial Commission. Upon any new trial of the charges, no person who activel y participated in the former trial may act as Commissioner. If any s uch ineligible person be selected as a Trial Commissioner he shall make the fact known at the earliest time possible, and his place on such Commission shall be filled by the Lodge, by electio n in the same 4 manner at its next regular meeting, or if no such m eeting occurs prior to the trial by appointment by the Master, concurre d in by a majority of the remaining Trial Commission.
