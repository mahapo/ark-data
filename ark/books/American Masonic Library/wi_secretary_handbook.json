Your good inclination to Masonry and this Lodge, will induce you to discharge the duties of your office with fidelity, and by so doing, you will me rit the esteem and applause of your Brethren.\" These are the instructions that are giv en to the Secretary at the time of being installed into office. If this was the total extent of the duties of a Secretary, that office would be one of very little work and never-ending pleasure, but such is not the case.

So me of the general duties, wh ich pertain to all Lodges, are listed herein. There are, however, di fferences in Lodges and, as a result, different duties for the Secr etary. This Handbook will not try to list any of the special duties of each Lodge, for to do so would be an endless listing. THE DUTIES 1. Attend all regular and specia l communications of the Lodge. 2. Record the proceedings of each comm unication and report the same to the Lodge on order of the Worshipful Mast er. Transmit a copy to the Grand Lodge when requested. 3. Receive all monies paid into the Lodge and pay them over to the Treasurer, taking his receipt therefore. 4. Establish an accounting system, which will account for, in detail, all the monies received by, or paid out by t he Lodge. This does not include any monies in the hands of the Trustees. 5. Receive, answer and originate all correspondence received by the Worshipful Master and turned over to the Secretary for action. 6.

They are the account of what transpired wit hin the tiled communications. THEY ARE THE HISTORY OF THE LODGE. Great care should be exercised in the writing of the minutes to be sure that the correct hi story of the lodge is functioning at that time. Well-written and orderly minutes are t he best proof that the lodge is in good hands. Many members will agree that well-wr itten minutes are a pleasure to hear and read, whereas poorly written minutes seem to be a bore to everyone. The secretary should always rememb er that he is writing hist ory, and any history to be interesting must be well written. Add a li ttle color to your minutes and see how the members on the sidelines appreciate them. There are some very old and well-established rules and uses in Masonry and some of them apply to the writing of mi nutes. Here are a few that will aid the secretary in writing his minutes: • The minutes of a lodge, after appr oval, cannot be altered or expunged. Should errors be found in the minutes, a fter they were approved, they are to be corrected upon the minutes of a subsequent communication. See the Wisconsin Masonic Code, R egulations for Lodges, 52.06. • All constituent lodge communications are always opened and closed in DUE FORM. • If the Most Worshipful Grand Master opens an/or closes a lodge, either Grand Lodge or a constituent lodge, it is always done IN DUE AND AMPLE FORM. The order of business used in the minutes of a lodge may vary fr om year to year. The Worshipful Master has the authority to establish any order of business that he desires. See Wisconsin Masonic Code, Regulations for Lodges, 56.06. The wise secretary will write his minut es in the same order as the Worshipful Master conducts the communication. If this met hod is followed, future generations will note that various Worshipful Masters conducted the business of the lodge in different manners. The following pages show a sample of the minutes for a Stated Communication. It is for the purpose of helping the secretary to see what adding co lor to the minute's means. Always remember the more colorful your minutes, the more interest you will command from the member s on the sidelines. Try and make the HISTORY OF YOUR LODGE as colorful and interesting as possible.

The color of the pages is yellow, green, pink, and white. This has been done to be certain that each member of the committee receives the correct questions an d that the same questions are not sent to all members of the committee in e rror. The distribution is as follows: 1. If the lodge HAS a Master's Committ ee, each member of the committee of Three will be sent ONE page of the questionnaire, yellow, green or pink. The fourth or white page will be reta ined by the Lodge Secretary and given to the chairman of the Master's Co mmittee to be used when that committee interviews the petitioner. 2. If the lodge DOES NOT HAVE a Mast er's Committee the yellow and green pages are to be sent to TWO member s of the Committe e of Three, one page to each member. The pink and whit e pages are to be sent to the THIRD member of the Committee of Three. When a petition has been received by a lodge and the Worshipful Master has appointed a Committee of Three, the secretary of the lodge will then prepare each page of the interview packet by entering the following data relative to the petitioner. 1. Full name 2. Date of birth 3. Place of birth 4. Age 5. Residence, house number. stre et name, city and zip code 6. Name of employer 7. Names of two Brothers w ho recommended the petitioner. The secretary of the lodge will send to each member of the Committee of Three the correct copies as designated above together with one copy of “The Interviewing Committee”. The committee mem ber who receives the pink and white pages (if the lodge does not have a Master's committee) is to be sent a copy of the Grand Lodge publication \"Freemasonry\" which he is to give to t he petitioner. If the lodge has a Master's Committee the copy of \"Freemasonry\" is to be given to the petitioner by the Master's Committee. The secretary of the lodge will also notif y the Chairman of the Master's Committee of the pending petitio n in order that t he chairman may call a meeting of that committee. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 FINANCIAL RECORDS Introduction It is a well-known fact, that Lodges, which have a good accounting system seldom, if ever, find themselves in fi nancial difficulties. In Lodges where the Secretary and Treasurer keep a good and de tailed accounting of all monies received and/or paid out, it is easy to ma ke spot checks from time to time to determine the financial condition of the Lodge. It is also easy to determine if the Lodge is adhering to the budget under which the Lodge is operating. There are many pitfalls for a Lodge that has not established good accounting procedure. One of these pitfalls is the failure of the Lodge to separate the \"DUES\" paid by each member into the two parts. These two parts are dues to the Lodge for the operation and support of the Lodge, and the Per Capita Tax due to the Grand Lodge. The Per Capita Tax, which is part of the \"DUES\" paid by every member, is not money, which belongs to the Lodge. The Lodge is only the AGENT for the Grand Lodge in collecting the Per Capita Tax. By March 1 st, the Secretary has to send a copy of the Re capitulation Report, together with the Per Capita Tax, which is due at that time, to the Grand Lodge. The Finance Committee of each Lodge, together with the Secretary and Treasurer, can look over the past financia l reports and determine what accounts it will be necessary for the Secretary and Treasur er to keep, in order to be able to inform the Lodge at all times of their financial condition. There may be other accounts, which the Secretary keeps for his own personal benefit to lighten his work in preparing the Annua l Financial Statement. Each Lodge is to decide for itself which accounts are necessary to main tain a clear and accurate picture of its financial condition at all times. Make use of the Lodge Budget Worksheet in the Wisconsin Masonic Handbook Appendix, Form 8. . A good policy would be to set up your ledger accounts using the Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet accounts found on our Annual Financial Statement as a guide. That way, at the end of the year you could tally your accounts and have all the figures you need to complete your Statement.

If you have any questions at all regarding your Financial Statement, please call the Grand Lodge Office. Often, a phone call will help solve a problem before it gets out of hand. LODGE BUDGET It is extremely important that each and every lodge have a budget. Each spring, a new budget should be planned for the next y ear. This may seem premature, but when you realize that your dues amount for the coming year must be set by September 15th, spring is the perfect time to begin planni ng for the next year. Since your lodge dues will make up the bul k of your income, dues should be the primary concern of the budget committee. If your dues are t oo low, you will not have enough money to function. Social reimbursement is also an import ant factor. A lodge should never plan a deficit. Barring unforeseen factors, your social events should all break even, or make a slight profit. Budgets are not an easy thing to plan. You, as the secretary, will need to provide information such as is listed on t he Lodge Budget Worksheet. All of this information should be in your ledgers or at least in your copies of the Financial Statement from the previous year. This will give the committee a good basis on which to plan a sensible and realistic budget.
