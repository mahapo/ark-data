They are particularly emblematic of th e great public school system of our country, the foundation of that universal enlightenment that is the crowning glory of our institutions. Devoted ch ampionship of our public schools is a cardinal teaching of the Order of De Molay. We are unalterably opposed to the same building housing a school, a church and a seat of civil government. Civil, religious and intellec tual liberty are the three sources of our country’s greatness, but they mu st stand alone, upon separate foundations and under sep arate roofs. ‘These book s, representative of those being carried to an d from the public school s by millions of boys and girls each day, are just as vital symbols of our liberties as the Holy Bible, which is the rule and guide of our fa ith, or the flag which protects the church, the school and the seat of civ il power. We, therefore, place these books upon the Altar and I solemnly en join you ever to stand unswervingly for the protection and perpet uity of the free public sc hools, the citadel of our safety and the source of the only real freedom possible in a government of the people, by the people and for the people.

In all the crises of the nation’ s history, we have called upon our young manhood and thank God they have nev er failed to respon d. Young men have fought every war our country ha s ever waged and the red upon that glorious banner is dyed a richer hue wi th the precious blood the nation’s youth has shed.

When a Mason dies, the Master of the lodge and on e or more of the members should call upon the widow and family, express sympathy and extend Masonic courtesies, which include: • Offering to provide a Masonic memorial service. • Offering to provide a Masonic apron, if the deceased brother's apron is not available. • Offering to provide personal servic es such as pallbearers (active or honorary), drivers or notification of friends and relatives. 2. The Masonic Memorial Service is conducted at the request of the deceased brother's family. The Servic e is to be in the memory of the deceased brother. When asked to perf orm the Masonic Memorial Service, it is an honor and privilege to serve th e family and friends of the deceased brother. 3. The Masonic Memorial Service should not be confused with a funeral service, which should be conducted by the clergy chosen by the family. The Masonic Memorial Service should not be longer than 30 minutes and should be conducted in advance of the rel igious service. It is imperative to consult with the clergy involved to avoid duplication or embarrassment . Remember that the purpose of the serv ice is to supple ment the brother's personal religion, and not upstage it. 4. The deceased brother's clergy should be invited to the Masonic Memorial Service.

Many Lodges organize a telephone committee to invite members to attend the service. 5. The Masonic Memorial Service mu st be executed with proficiency, sensitivity, dignity and in a worshipful attitude and atmo sphere. The format of the service should be well-prepared , large type and double-spaced for easy reading. It need not be memorized. The Brother leading the service, who may be the Master or a Master Ma son designated by him, should be practiced and familiar with the material so he is able to present it in a manner which will convey the feeling and meaning of the words and, at the same time, maintain rapport with thos e who are listening in a fluent and smooth manner. 6. A Masonic Memorial Service is public. For many persons, the only exposure they have to Freemasonry is a Memorial Service. A positive impression must be left with those in attendance . 7. In the rare situation where no funera l service is to be conducted by the clergy, the Lodge may do so w hen requested by the family. 8. The clergy should perform the commi ttal. if no clergy is available for that purpose, the Lodge may do so , when requested by the family. 9. In every case, the wishes of the family shall be respected. 10. Any of the following Memorial Serv ices are appropriate to be used. It is also acceptable and may even be desirable to comb ine, edit, or otherwise amend these recommended services to ma ke them fitting and right for the individual brother or situation.

Freemasonry believes that a rational God, who could create the wonder, which is man, would not do so only to destroy him. God's reasonableness is balanced by His love for His creat ure. And man's faith has been so inspired by th is conviction, that he has dared persecution, and even death, rather than deny this sust aining trust. Freemasonry, therefore, refuses to believe that extinction is the ul timate fate of such worth. It insists that to believe in God is to believe in His ability to bring to completion that which He has begun. Hence, the as surance of immortality brings to every Mason the hope once expressed by t he Psalmist who said, \"The Lord will fulfill His purpose for me.\" In the time of sorrow, when men need comfort and consolation, let us turn reverently to God, who, in the midst of the trials and tribulations that are a"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 part of life can alone endue us with t hat quietness of spirit, that peace of mind and heart, which the world can neither give nor take away.

It used the tools of the bu ilder as emblems and symbols to teach Masons how to build the temple of the soul a nd thus fit us for that house not made with hands, eternal in heavens. The term \"builder\" is not lightly felt nor lightly used by Masons. The Mason is taught, first to build his own temple ... the temple of his own existence. He is taught, also, to build with ot hers, pledging his ti me and energy to a common life and welfare and, in all th e building to seek the will of God. The Mason is a worker in the quarri es of life where he cuts and shapes stones for the foundation of the great buildings: t he buildings of freedom, understanding, peac e and brotherhood. Masons believe sincerely that when life on earth comes to a close, the soul is translated from the imperf ections of this mortal sphere to that all-perfect and glorious home where God, the G rand Architect of the Universe, presides. With these truths and Etern al and everlasting God, we look to Thee in faith and confidence knowing that Thy love has power to bring comfort and consolation, even in this time of bereavement, to those near and dear to our Brother.

There are some outside our Craft who seem to think Freemasonry is a religion. It is not. It has neither dogma nor creed. And yet, it is religious. It is religious because its entire structure is erected on the foundation of a belief in, and a reliance on, the one true God, the almighty and loving father of us all. The lessons we teach ar e as old as the words in the Holy Scriptures that lie open on our altar whenever we meet. In fact, our lessons can all be found between the cove rs of that beautiful old book.

This common faith in immortality has created and sustained a gre at historic, heroic fellowship, in which are united, the brave and true of every age, who set among dangers and difficulties, struggled, endured, an d triumphed. When through long ages, men of every station in life, the st rong and the tender; the wise and the simple; the doer and the dreamer; ar rive at the same conclusion, the verdict is overwhelming - if a m an dies, his soul shall live. On occasions like this, the Holy Sc riptures, the great light in every degree of Masonry, brings us its most hopef ul message. it imbues us with a sense of the dignity of the human personality, its sacredness, its august destiny. It teaches us that our mortal lives, brief, broken and frail as they may be, have a meaning for God; that death is not the end; that beyond its shadows awaits a more beautiful and nobler life.

Our passing from the mortal to the eternal presents the deepest paradox of life. Out of the shadow of death, which seems to destroy hope, comes faith in immortality. At t he moment when nature seems to destroy, when man seems forsaken of God, there rises in his soul courage, confidence, spiritual aspiration whic h all the tragedies of time have been impotent to extinguish, affirming the liv ing truth that \"Life is ever Lord of death and love can never lose its own.” \"Let these flowers be to us a symbol of remembrance of the virtues of those departed brothers who have prec eded us to that hallowed land, a token of that fraternal alliance which binds us together while here on earth and which we are sure will re-unite us in heaven.” "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 W.M.: (Taking the apron and displaying it to the assembled mourners:) The lambskin, or white apron, is an emblem of innocenc e, and the badge of a Mason.

Happy indeed is the occasion when years of age stand united with y ears of service, and when an honor may be conferred upon a Brother who is both worthy and esteemed. Masons have learned that we progress t hrough life in three principal stages - Youth, Manhood and Age. In Youth, we may occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, we apply that knowledge to the discharge of our duties to God, our neighbors, and ours elves; so that in Age, we may enjoy happy memories of a life well spent. Our present gathering a ffords an opportunity to reflect upon the past; from experiences of the past. The present receives that useful counsel and guidance which enable us to erect a more glorious future. To those of mature years we look for wisdom, and upon wisdom Freemasonry builds each laudable enterprise.

You, along with all the other Past Mast ers of this lodge, have been a great source of inspiration in preparing me to carry out the work of Freemasonry as Master of this Lodge. No Master is chosen by his seniority, but is elected by his merit. As in all earthly endeavors, there is a phrase that most uni quely applies to those who have earned a position of leadersh ip. \"From the ranks you arose, and to the ranks yo u shall return.\" Brother <NAME>, you will now be returning to join the elite company of those brethren who have distinguished themselves by serving their respective Lodges as its Master, and now proudly wear the title PAST - MASTER . You have suffered the trials and tribulat ions of leading a Lodge, and as in all endeavors, at each point you lear ned something that would prepare you for the future; be it in Masonry, or in life itself. As you progressed through the line of officers, it prepared you for many things, and often one is not fully p repared to be the Mast er of a Lodge until he has served as Master of a Lodge. Though your y ear as Master may have been short compared to the cal endar of time, the designs, which you laid down on the trestleboard during your term will inspire and bear fruit for many years to come. "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 Your experiences of having served as the Master of a Lodge has prepared you for a greater service to mankind and to Masonry. You may, and will, be called upon by any of the future Masters of this Lodge to aid and assist in perpetuating the ideals and traditions of Freemasonry; practicing and teaching in all stations in life those excellent tenets of our institution: Friendship, Morality, and Brotherly Love. I now have the pleasure of presentin g you with your Past Master's certificate and card. <Done. > The Past Master's jewel is co mmonly recognized as a square and compasses extended sixty degrees on the fourth part of a circle, or quadrant, with a sun in the center. This is a very fitting jewel, as its components speak volumes to all wh o truly understand Freemasonry, and are certainly worth reiterating on this occasion. The square is dedicated to the Master, and is the proper emblem of his office. By the square, Freemasonry in stills in its members the quality of virtue. We continually attempt to squ are our actions by t he square of virtue, which is exactly what is meant when we hear \"Square up with him,\" or \"A square deal.\" It is the type of behavior we expect from a man who has demonstrated his skills as a Master, and will now practice them forever as a Past-Master. Freemasonry uses the compasses to im press the ideal of circumspection. As the compasses draws a complete circle , we continually use this tool to remind us that our behavior, desi res, and passions should be equally circumspect and always kept within d ue bounds. If done successfully, this tool aids us to be referred to by al l as \"well-rounded individuals.\" As before, this type of levelheaded, controlled behav ior is expected of a Past Master, and should serve to remind him to se t an example for all whom for now him. The significance of the compas ses open to an angle of sixty degrees is that it cannot help but form a square when bisected with the arc. Since the Past Master is equipped wi th the knowledge and tools to form a square, this jewel represents that ideal to all who are still striving to attain it. The sun in the center can take on a my riad of meanings. To Freemasons, it has two primary meanings. First, it is a symbol of light; a term used by Masons and the world to mean knowledge. It is believed that you have now acquired sufficient knowledge in Masonry to be considered a \"Master\" of"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 155 the craft. It is now your responsibility as a Past Master to impart it to others. Second, and undoubtedly most import ant, it is an emblem of Divine Providence; God's power, His goodness, omnipresence, and eternity that Masonry teaches should live in the he art of every human being. In that respect, let it mean to you as a Past -Master that which is stated in the Bible, \"Let your light so shine bef ore men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.\" (You may use the Optional below fo r the wife to invest jewel.)

No one but a Past Master has a full conception of the hours spent and the sacrifices made on behalf of the interest of the craft.
