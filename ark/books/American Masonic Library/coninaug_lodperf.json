This ceremonial is prepared especially to be used when a Lodge of Perfection is to be constituted and inaugurated and its officers installed, by the Grand Commander-in-Chief of a Grand Consistory, assisted by members of the same. A Sovereign or Deputy Grand Inspector General, performing it, with or without assistance, will easily make the necessary changes, observing that the passages included within double asterisks will be omitted by him. The installation ceremony will be used by itself, where the Lodge has been previously consktuted. The Hall is arranged as for a reception. The triangle over the East, with the name ~ ‘7Y in the center, is lighted. The pedestal, on which is the cube, is covered with black cloth. The 3, 5, 7 and 9 lights are not lighted. The censer for the perfumes is on the altar of incense; the bread and wine on the table of shew-bread; the oil and trowel on the altar of incense; and the brazen basin of water on the column in front of the Senior Warden. I The Officers and Members are all in full dress. The three ligbts in front of the Junior Warden form a triangle; those in front of the Senior Warden, a square, with one in the center; those in front of the Orator, a hexagon, with one in the center; and those in the East, a triple triangle; the three lights in the center forming a small circle. One sentinel only is stationed on the outside.

We understand, Illustrious Brother, how significant it is, that we have received that TRUE WORD of a MASTER, of which those commonly called Masters receive only an insignificant substitute. We under - stand that the title of “lU2zster” also meant, among our Ancient Hebrew Brethren, Teacher, and Sage, as well as Chief and Leader.

We are painfully conscious that we shall fall far short of being all that the word “Master” implies. No one acts as well as he resolves. We can only promise that we will not cease from labor and endeavor; that we will not lower the standard of Masonic duty, nor - consent that the Masonry of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, divesting itself of its high prerogatives shall look with indifference on the evils of Society and the State, and declare itself neutral in the controversy between good and evil, right and wrong, liberty and 2 ii ii"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"S 15 OON5TITUTION AND INAUGURATION oppression.

We reciprocate your kind feelings, and fully concur in what you have so wisely said. If ‘V your body should continue to be actuated by these, it cannot fail to attain high honor and to do good service to Masonry. A king, it has been said, may abdicate for his own person, but he cannot abdicate for the monarchy. An individual Mason or a Masonic body V may by both theory and practice declare that Masonry is, for him or it, neither the royal nor the sacerdotal art, that it has neither a religious nor a political faith, and lb that its super-excellence consists in obedience to despotism, in its indifference to political evils, in a general inefficiency and incapacity; but Masonry itself V has authorized no one man nor any number of men so to drag it down from its old high estate. It is true that man rarely acts as nobly as he resolves. But it is not to be lamented that we always have before us an ideal of excellence, to which, with all our exertions, we cannot attain. It is thus that the soul asserts its superiority, and shows that there is in it something of the Divine. We effect little, when we do not aim at a mark higher than we can reach.

There will never be a new Atlantis. Yet to believe it possible is the only way to make possible a well-ordered Republic. It is not even possible to have a free government in which there shall not be ineradicable evils—corruption, misuse of powers, legislation by the incompetent, large powers of execution entrusted to base and unclean hands. Perhaps no free government can be long-lived; the day of anarchy must come to all, of insecurity of property, of intestine feuds and civil wars, and after them the Dictatorship, the Protectorate or the Empire. Nevertheless, we must hope that this is not inevitable, and that premature decay is not the implacable doom of all republics, or we shall effect ~nothing for the State. The atrocities of civil war, the ungenerous, ignoble and despicable revenges taken by the victors, and the unmanly compliances by which the conquered, fonder of life than of honor, seek to conciliate them, may seem to warrant us in believing that men are unfit to be free, unworthy to be died for, incapable of self-government; but if we think so, discouragement will paralyze us, and we shall cease to struggle against the current or to think liberty worth contending for.

You owe, them to your family and relatives, to friends and neighbors, to those~ with whom you deal in business, to the city or village in which you live, to the State, and above all to God. To perform these duties well, requires constant effort. and constant resistance to temptation, and a watch - fullness over ourselves that never sleeps.

To - A! devote many hours of a short life, at regular intervals, Vip. and these often too frequent, to an incessant repetition of the same formulas of words, and to going over the same ceremonies; reducing the lecture, which was meant to be interesting and instructive, to half a dozen stereotyped and utterly insignificant questions and answers, inevitably narrows the mind, and makes it live on trifles. Words become more serious and sacred than things; and what is really substantial, being regarded as unimportant, is utterly lost sight of. To have an accurate and tenacious memory, to know by heart- the lectures, the formulas of opening and closing, the ceremonials of reception—all this is really but a small portion of Masonry, and will by no means make a man a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sub - lime Mason.

It is, therefore. indispensable that you should make yourself familiar with these subjects, so that you may be able to instruct and 4 enlighten the Brethren; and so that your addresses and discourses may be worthy to be laid up and pre - served in the archives of the Lodge.

A trust your office may not prove a sinecure. Masonry is singularly boastful, and yet expends little in charity, in proportion to the means of her members, and even to the abundance of her revenues. The expenses of the varied machinery of Representative Masonic Gov - ernment are enormous, and out of all proportion to the value of the governing Bodies and their proceed - ings. We hope it may be the pride of this Lodge to distinguish itself by its abundant and thoughtful charities. It is your peculiar duty to seek out deserving objects for these charities, to see the widows and orphans of the Order provided for, and the sick watched with and tenderly cared for. You will particularly see that your Lodge never closes until the Box of Fraternal Assistance has been passed round; and that no Brother withdraws before that time arrives, without depositing his contribution with one of the Wardens. And you will always be careful, in bestowing the funds so obtained, never to let it be known by the recipient from what source such relief proceeds."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"I 64 OFFICE5 OF INSTALLATION It is our earnest wish that you may so administer IC the affairs of your office, that, when you lay it down, the exchequer of the Lodge may overflow with the thanks of widows and the gratitude of orphans.

My Brethren, Elected Officers of the Lodge, it was said by the Romans, “No bilitas ut ohm ab ofi2cio,” Nobility, as of olden time, from office. Office ennobles, when it is deserved, is .gained by no unworthy arts, and is honorably filled, with honest performance of duty. That you deserve the offices conferred upon you, the choice of your brethren gives reasonable ground to believe. That yow have not gained them by those despicable practices which, lately borrowed from political demagogues, begin to infest Symbolic Masonry, we do not need to be assured. It only remains that you should so perform all your official duties as to deserve well df Masonry. We call ourselves Perfect Masons, and our Lodges, Lodges of Perfection. - We ought to know at least what these words mean, and to what duties we become bound by accepting them.

The spirit or intellect is sacrificed by faith; the will by obedience; the senses by austerity; and life itself by martyrdom. To overcome the attractions of pleasure and interest, and to sacrifice these to duty, constitutes the whole merit of honor. To overcome the apprehension of pain and sorrow, and even of death, in order to obey honor, is heroism, is human perfection. We arrive at it by a progressive education of the will. Self—denial is apprenticeship for martyrdom. You are to be the chiefs, each in his station~ of this body of Free, Elect and Perfect Masons. It is self- denial, self-sacrifice that are G~rand and Sublime. It is those who are capable of these, that are Elect Masons; and those who perfect the sacrifice of self, are Perfect. These alone serve humanity efficiently. Each of you and of these brethren has firmly and solemnly apprenticed himself to honor and duty; and the sentiment of these is a religious sentiment. That it is a duty to sacrifice -one’s self for others; that a voluntary sacrifice is not unjust; that grace and the law are in harmony, is the one great religion of humanity, always revealed to faith by genius, and always the same under the veils of all mythologies and symbols.

If you do that, office will ennoble you. Then you will indeed be, what otherwise you cannot become, perfect Masons. So to aim at and advance toward Perfection, you must love it; and the love of Perfection is the Spirit of 4 Charity or Loving-kindness. Renunciation, self-denial, charity, are the heroism of all the virtues. We know God, only by the spirit of charity, mani - fested in teachings and acts. In these all revelation consists. Charity is Divine; and wherever the spirit of it is found, God is present, acting and manifested. Duty is clearly traced and easy to follow in all the relations of life. Hate and revenge, jealousy and envy are never duties. To embody these, or selfish interests, in individual action or in legislation, is a sad mistake. The spirit of charity, and duty, cannot be separated from each other. Masonry is the spirit of charity; for it is Brotherhood, permits no evil-speaking of each other, and inculcates the love so continually insisted on by John the Apostle. Persecutions and revengefhl legislation are alike follies as well as crimes. IHeaven would be hell, if the spirit of charity were V absent from it; and hell would be heaven, if it were present there.

They are not even united together for any great and common purpose, and thus drawn more closely together by the ties of a common danger and a common destiny; for Masonry, as an organization and a unit, has now no objects at all. Much less have they a disinterested affection for each other; but only pretense and idle words. The acerbities of religious and political feuds are as bitter between Masons as among the profane. All this necessarily resulted, when Masonry deter - mined to become the empty shadow of a name, by denuding itself of its old characteristics, parting with its old energies, and assuming an unarmed and inglo - rious neutrality in the many controversies between the Right and the Wrong; whereby it could not but become the passive and despised ally of Thrones and Demagogues. To restore Masonry to its old place, the old ties of brotherhood must be restored. Masonic relations must be again set above all others.
