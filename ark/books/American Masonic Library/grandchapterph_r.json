The motions necessary for Chapter purposes may be readily learned, and the result will more than compensate for the time spent in acquiring. The following will serve as a guide for proper use of the sword: DRAW SWORD Seize the scabbard near the top with the left hand and grasp the handle of the sword with the right hand; draw sword quickly, raising the arm to its full extent at an angle of forty—five degrees, the sword in a straight line with the arm; make a slight pause, drop the left hand by the side. CARRY SWORD Bring the back of the blade against the right shoulder, the blade perpendicular; arm nearly ex - tended downward, the thumb and first two fingers embracing the handle; left side of handle with thumb against thigh. PRESENT SWORD Carry the sword vertically to the front, raising the hand as high as the neck, and sIx inches from it; the thumb on the back of the handle; back of the handle to the right, elbow close to the body; blade Inclined to the front at an angle of thirty degrees. Left hand down at side. SALUTE SWORD Execute PRESENT SWORD, then drop point of the sword by extending the arm, so that the right hand is brought near the right thigh; back of hand down; the blade inclining downward and to the front. —5—"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"RETURN SWORD Take the position of PRESENT SWORD, at the same time grasp the scabbard near its top with the left hand; carry the right hand opposite and six inches from the left shoulder; lower the blade and pass it across and along the left arm; the point to the rear; turn slightly to the left, fixing the eyes on the opening of the scabbard; return the blade; turn head to the front and drop the hands by the sides.

At the building of King Solomon’s Temple there were eighty thousand Fellowcrafts employed. Among so large a number, itwouldbe natural to suppose that our Grand Masters would have been imposed upon by unskillful craftsmen presenting work unfit for use. But they were not; for King Solomon took the precaution that each craftsman should choose for himself a mark and place it upon his work, so that it should be known and dis - tinguished when brought up promiscuously for inspection. A brother’s mark therefore becomes synonymous with his name and you would have no more right to alter or change your mark, lend or sell it, than you would your name. You have also solemnly sworn that you will re - ceive the mark of a brother Mark Master Mason when offered to you as a pledge, and will grant his request if in your power; if not, you will re - turn his mark with the price thereof, which is a Jewish half shekel of silver, equal in value to the fourth part of a dollar.

HISTORICAL LECTURE My brothers, this degree is founded on the key stone of a certalnarchof King Solomon’s Temple. It was wrought by our Grand Master Hiram Abiff, but before he had given orders tohavelicarried up, he was slain, as we haVe had an accountin the pre~ed— ing degree. It so happened that on the sixth day of a certain week, when the Craftsmen were carrying up their work for inspection, a young Fellowcraft see - ing this piece of work, and concluding it designed for some portion of the Temple, brought it up. He presented it to the Junior Overseer at the South gate who observed that it was neitheroblongnor square, nor had it the mark of any of the workmen upon it, but for its singular form and beauty, he was unwill - ing to reject it, and su.fferedittopass to the Senior Overseer at the West gate. He for similar reasons suffered it to pass to the Master Overseer at the East gate, who called together his brother Over - seers and held a consultation. They observing, that it was neither oblong nor square, not having the mark of any of the workmen upon It, and not knowing the mark which was upon it, concluded it unfit for use and heaved it over among the rubbish. The Senior Warden then Informed King Solomon that the Temple was nearly compLetedbut for a cer - tain key stone, which none of them hadhad orders to furnish. King Solomon confidently belfeving that our Grand Master Hiram Abiff had completed this piece of work agreeable to the original design, made In - quiry of the Overseers to see if a piece of work —58— —59—"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"bearing a certain mark, had beenpresentedtothem for inspection. Upon inquiry, It was found there had, but for the reasons already given they had concluded it unfit for use and heaved it over among the rub - bish. King Solomon then ordered strict searchtobe made to see if it could be found. Search was ac - cordingly made, the stone found, and afterwards applied to its intended use. Its color was white, and to it alludes a certain passage of Scripture: “To him thatovercomethwill I give to eatof the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.” The new name Is composed of words of which the letters on the key stone are the initials, namely H. T.W. S.S. T.K. S. in passing an examination you will alternate these words, as I now do with the Senior Deacon. Brother Senior Deacon, commence. (Words are given In proper manner.) This was the mark of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff. It is now the general mark of this degree, In the center of which eachbrotherplaces his own pri - vate mark, to which the tie inthe obligation alludes. It will be necessary for you to select a mark, and cause It to be filed with the Secretary, to be re - corded in the Lodge book of marks before you can lawfully receive the degree of Royal Arch Mason. This degree was founded to be conferred on all who should be found worthy and well qualified, not only as an honorary reward for their zeal, fidelity and attachment to Masonry, but to render It Im - possible that any brother, who should be found worthy of being advanced to this honorary degree, should never be reduced to such extreme Indigence as to suffer for the common necessaries of life, when the price of his markwouldprocure the same. A brother presenting his mark and craving as - sistance represents our Grand Master Hiram Abiff, who was a poor man; but for his regular and upright conduct, his great skill in architecture and the sciences became eminently distinguished among the craftsmen. A brother receiving the mark and grantingassist - ance, represents our Grand Master Solomon, King of Israel, who was a rich man and eminently dis- tinguished for his great liberality. WORKING TOOLS The working tools of a Mark Master Mason are the Chisel and Mallet. The Chisel is usedhy opera - tive masons to cut, carve, mark, and indent their work. It morally demonstrates the advantages of discipline and education. The mind, like the rough ashiar when taken from the quarries, is rude and un - po]ished; but as the effect of the chiselin the hands of the skillful workman soon outlines and perfects the carved capital, the stately shaft, and the beauti - ful statue, so education discovers the latentvirtues of the mind and draws them forth to range the large field of matter and space, to display the summit of human know]edge, our duty to God and man. The Mallet is used by operative masons to knock off excrescences and to smooth surfaces. It morally teaches to correct Irregularities and reduce manto a proper level; so that, by quiet deportment, he may In the school of discipline, learntobe content. What the Mallet is to the workman, enlightened reason is to the passions; it curbs ambition, it depresses envy, it moderates anger, and It encourages good dispositions; whence arises among masons that comely order: “Which nothing earthiy gives or can destroy, The soul’s calm sunshine, andtheheartfelt joy.” LEC TURE Q. — Are you a Mark Master Mason?

XX, 1—16 verses or from the quotation below. ‘It is like unto man that is an householder, which went out early in the Morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with thelaborersforapennyaday, he sent them into his vineyard, and he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market—place, and said unto them, go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right I give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise, and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto him, because no man hath hired us, He saith unto them go ye aLso into the vineyard; and what so ever is right, that shall ye receive. So when the even was come, the Lord ofthevineyard saithunto his steward, Call the laborers and give them their hire, beginning from the last until the first. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny, but when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received it they murmured against the good man of the house, saying, these last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and the heat of the day. But he answeredone of them, and said, Friend I do thee no wrong; Didst notthouagree with me for one penny? Take thine is and go thy way; I will give unto this last even unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last.” ([F DES~ED THE FOLLOWING LECTURE MAY BE USED) My Brother, the Keystone of the degree is duty. “Stern daughter of the voice of God.” We live not merely to breathe, but to act, therefore remembering that our works live after us, “Let us do our might, what our hands find to do.” The Chisel and the mallet teach us not to be found in the market-place, idly standing with folded hands, but to “Work while the day lasts,” for life was not given for a possession, but for use. This degree morally teaches us thatwe are to be honest in our work — not demandLng wages that we have not earned — to let our hands bear the mark of our work, whether in the burden and heat of the day, or in the coolness of the eventide. We are also admonished that there is an Eye that looks to our work, to see if it bears the stamp of His name, and Lest we should weary as we toil from day to day, we are encouraged by the promise of reward if we faint not. And this inspires us to put ourselves — soul and body, talent and energy — faithfully to perform the work that lies before us; that, when the shadows of night falL, and we can workno more, we shall hear with gladness the command, “Call the laborers and give them their hire.” “Then shall each brother’s tongue declare how bounteous his wages are.” The design of all Masonry is a search for truth, and he who earnestly seeks it shall be —70— —71—"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"rewarded for his labors in the attainment of his desires. So, in the vineyard of Masonry, it matters not whether we begin with the morning sun— bearing the heat and burdens of the day—or in the darkening twilight, at the eleventh hour, if we but do our work faithfully and earnestly, we shall receive our wages in a clear conscience and with the commendation “well done, good and faithful servant.’ RWM — (To the Senior Warden) The Right Worship - ful Masters Station.

It was originally, and is to this day, an honorary degree, and shouldbe con - ferred only on the newly electedMasterofa Lodge. But as it hasbecome a permanent component part of the Capitular. System, it is therefore useless to con - tend with what is often termed the “inconsistency” of conferring an honor where no equivalent services have been or are expected to be rendered. As the rulers of Masonry are, and should only be, selected for their superior skill and intelligence, they alone should be permitted to receive the valu— able light and information contained in the cere— monies of this degree. Those who receive the degree inthe Chapter are termed “Virtual” Past Masters, incontradistinction to those who have been elected and installed in a regularly constituted Symbolic Lodge, who are called “Actual” Past Masters; the former having no rights or privileges, as such, out of the Chapter. In order to harmonize many of the controversies that were constantly arising in respect to the con - tending rights of Past Masters, the General Grand Chapter of the United States, in 1856, adopted a resolution, recommending the Chapters under its jurisdiction “to abridge the ceremonies now con - ferred in the Past Masters Degree within the nar - rowest constitutional limits, only retaining the in - ducting of the candidate into the Oriental Chair, and communicating the means of recognition.” The regular officers of a Past Masters Lodge correspond exactly with those of a Lodge of Master Masons. The officers of a Chapter take rank in a Past Masters Lodge are as follows: —The High Priest, as Master; The King, as Senior Warden; The Scribe, as Junior Warden; The Secretary, Treasurer, and Tiler occupy the corresponding stations; The Cap— tam of the Host, as Marshal; The Principle Sojourn - er, as Senior Deacon; The Royal Arch Captain, as Junior Deacon. The Symbolic Color of the Past Masters Degree is purple. The Apron is of white lambskin, square at tl~e corners, edged with purple, and the Jewel of the degree inscribed upon it. The collar is purple, edged with gold.

ADDRESS TO CANDIDATE RWM — (Or some designated brother of the Lodge) My brothers, the conferring atthls time, of a de - gree which has no historical connectionwith the other Capitular degrees is an apparent anomaly, which, however, Ls indebted for Its existence to the following circumstances. Originally when Royal Arch Masonry was under the government of Symbolic Lodges, in which the Royal Arch degree was then always conferred, it was a regulation that no one could receive it unless he had previously presided as the Master of that or some other Lodge, and this restriction was made because the Royal Arch was deemed too important a degree to be con - ferred only on Master Masons. But, as by con - fining the Royal Arch to those only who had been actually elected as the presiding officer of their Lodges, the extension of the degree would have been materially circumscribed, and its useful - ness greatly impaired, the Grand Master often granted upon due petition his dispensation to per - mit certain Master Masons, although not elected to preside over their Lodges, to passthe Chair, which is a technical term, intended to designate a brief ceremony, by which the candidate is In - vested with the mysteries of a Past Master, and like him entitled to advance in Masonry as far as the Royal Arch, or the perfection and consmn - mation of the third degree. When, however, the control of the Royal Arch was taken from the Symbolic Lodges and intrust— ed to a distinct organization, that namely, of Chapters, the regulation continued to be ob - served, for it was doubtful to many if it could be —84— —85—"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"legalLy abolished, and, as the law still requires that the august degree of Royal Arch shallbe re - stricted to Past Masters, our candidates are made to pass the Chair simply as apreparation and qualification towards being invested with the solemn instruction of the Royal Arch. Your receiving this degree confers uponyou no offlcialrank outside the Chapter. The honors and peculiar privileges belonging to the Chair of Symbolic Lodges are confined exclusively to those who have been duly elected to preside over and govern such Lodges, andwhohavebeen called “Actual Past Masters,” whereas those who receive the degree in the Chapter are termed “Virtual Past Masters,” for although they are invested with the secrets of the degree, yet they are not entitled to the rights and pre - rogatives of “Actual Past Masters.” With this brief explanation of the reason why this degree Is now conferred upon you, and why you have been permitted to “Preside as Master In the Chair” you will retire and suffer yourself to be prepared for those further and profounder researches into Masonry which can only be consummated in the Royal Arch Degree. CHARGE TO CANDIDATE My Brother, The Past Master degree unlike all the other degrees of Free—masonry, sheds no light upon itself. It was formerly conferred only on Masters of Lodges, to instruct them In the duties they owed the Lodges over which they were called to preside, and likewise the duties of the brethren to the Chair; but we, as Royal Arch Masons, confer this degree, not only asapreliminary step, but also for the more important purpose of guarding against a breach of our Masonic obligations. We are all, my brother, too apt to come forward and kneel at our sacred altar and take upon ourselves the most solemn obligations to perform certain duties and then behave as if we had not done so. This, my brother is not as it should be. Let the scene which you have this evening wit - nessed be a striking lesson to you, and not only to you, but to us all as Masons, never to lose sight of the solemn obligations which we have all taken upon ourselves of our own freewill, and in the most sol - emn manner promised that we would never violate. It becomes your duty as a Past Master, by amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct, to convince mankind of the goodness of the Institution; so that when a person is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he Is one to whom the burden - ed heart maypour out its sorrows; to whom distress may prefer its suit; whose hand Is guidedby justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence. If you have any doubt of the extent of your obli - gations, a daily recourse tothe Scriptures of Divine Truth will set you right. It will make your duties plain, and the discharge of them a pleasure rather than a burden. Make then the Holy Bible, that Great Light In Masonry, the man of your counsels, and the meditation of your heart. It will never mislead nor deceive you, but a strict observance of its holy precepts will fit and prepare you for usefulness In this life, and for a glorious Inheritance In that which is to come.

The masonic tradition upon which the degree Is founded Is described in the ancient bdok of constitu - tions, in the following words: “The temple was finished In the short space of seven years and six months, to the amazementof all the world; when the cape—stone was celebrated by the fraternity with great joy. Butthelrjoywas soon interrupted by the sudden death of their dear Master, Hiram Abiff, whom they buried in the Lodge near the temple, according to ancient usage.” “After Hiram Abiff was mourned for, the taber - nacle of Moses and its holy relics being lodged in the temple, Solomon, in a general assembly, dedi - cated or consecrated it bysolemnprayerandcostly sacrifices past number, with the finest music, vocal and instrumental, praising Jehovah, upon fixing the holy ark in its proper place, betweenthecherubim; when Jehovah filled his own temple with a cloud of glory. ~ None but those who, through diligence and in - dustry, have progressed far toward perfection; none but those who have been seated inthe Oriental Chair by the suffrages of their brethren, can be admitted to this degree. In its original establishment, when the Temple at Jerusalem was finished, and the fraternity cele - brated the cape—stone with great joy, it is demon - strable that none but those who had proved them - selves to be complete masters of their profession were admitted to this honor; and, indeed, the duties incumbent on every Mason, who is “recleved and acknowledged” as a Most Excellent Master, are such as rendered it indispensible that he should have a perfect knowledge of all the preceding degrees. It is therefore apart of the wisdom and justice of Solomon’s plan to bestow upon many of his most skillful workmen some distinguishing mark of his approval. No higher appreciation of valuable ser - vices could have been rendered to the worthy and meritorious than conferring upon them an Order of Merit, with the honorable title of “Most Excellent Master.” And it Is still retained by us as a memo - rial of the method adopted by the King of Israel to distinguish the most skillful portion of the craft, and to reward them for their services in behalf of the fraternity. The officers of a Lodge of Most Excellent Mas - ter are: 1. RIght Worshipful Master 2. Senior Warden The officers of a Chapter rank as follows: The High Priest as Right Worshipful Master and the King as Senior Warden, and forthepur— poses of reception, the Captain of the Host act as Marshal or the Master of Ceremonies; the principal Sojourner as the Senior Deacon; the Royal Arch Captain as the Junior Deacon, and the Treasurer, Secretary and Tiler as in the Chapter. The RIght Worshipful Master represents King Solomon, and may appropriately be clothed in the Kings Robes. The symbolic color of the Most Excellent Mas - ter’ s degree is purple. The Apron of white lamb - skin, square at the corners, edged with purple, and the color of purple edged with gold. In this, as in the other preparatory degrees, It Is customary to use the clothing of the Chapter. Lodges of the Most Excellent Masters are dedicated to the “memory of King Solomon.” A candidate receiving the degree is said to be “Re - ceived and acknowledged as a Most Excellent Master.” —92— —93—"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MOST EXCELLENT MASTER OPENING RWM — (r) Bro.

HKT — Most Excellent King Solomon, it is indeed ~ fitting time for the performance of the solemn ceremonial of the dedication of the Temple, and it is my desire to participate in that sacred service; but I recall with profound sorrow the death of one long associatedwithus in the build - ing of the Temple, and deeply deplore his absence from an occasion that must present to every builder astonishing evidence of the mag - nitude and excellence of his handiwork. KS — Alas, poor Hiram, his death was indeed un - timely. I would that he werewithus this day; but as that cannot be, let us console ourselves with the reflection that the perfectness and beauty of his workmanship, his virtue, his integrity, and his piety will be revered by all true craftsmen throughout the earth to the latestposterity.

But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; andhavechosenDavidtobe over my people Israel. Now it was in the heart of David, my father, to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel. But the Lord said to David, my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thoudidstwellinthat it was in thine heart; notwithstanding, thou shalt not build the house; bul thy son, which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shallbuild the house for my name. I The Lord, therefore, hath performed his word that he hath spoken; for I am risen up in the room of David, my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the Lordpromised, and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel; and in it I have put the Ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, that he made with the children of Israel.

Now then 0 Lord God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hastspokenuntothyser— vant David. But will God in very deed dwell with men on earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how mucliless this house which I have built I Have respect, therefore, to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, 0 Lord, my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee; that thine eyes may be upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou —114— —115—"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.

HISTORICAL LECTURE My brother, in the course of the ceremonies of this degree you have received a sign in addition to those given you at the altar. It is this (gives sign.) This is the Sign of Admiration. It alludes to the wonder and admiration expressed by those of our ancient brethren who were permitted to view the interior of that magnificent edifice which King Solomon had erected, but more es - pecially to the admiration and astonishment of those who beheld the sublime manifestations of the Supreme Being at the dedication of the Temple, when fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrLfices, and the glory of the Lord filled the Lord’s house. The ceremonies of this degree are intended to represent those of the completlonand dedica - tion of King Solomon’s Temple. You have now arrived at a period of Masonrywhen the labor is over. The keystone has been placed in the princi - pal arch, the temple finished, and the Ark, which has been so long without a resting place, has been at length safely seated. We have imitated our ancient brethren in assembling on that occasion, repairing to the place designated, and participating in those solemn ceremonies. We have imitated them in gathering around the altar, engaging in prayer, and have witnessedarepre - sentation of the fire coming down from heaven, consuming the burnt offering andthe sacrifices. We have also Imitated their astonishment on be - holding it, by falling down upon the ground and exclaiming “He Is good; for his mercy endureth forever.” A perusal of the books of Chronicles and Kings will give you a minute description of the Temple and of the ceremonies here intended to be represented. You will there find that the foundations of the Temple were laldby King Solomon in the year of the world 2992, and the building was finished in the year 3000. About seven years and six months were con - sumed in its erection. It was dedicated in the year 3001, with the ‘I most imposing and solemn ceremonies, to the worship of JEHOVAH, who condescended to make it the place for the special manIfestation of his glory. The ceremonies lasted fourteen days. Seven days of this festival were devoted to the dedication exclusively, and seven to the Feast of the Tabernacle. —116— —117—"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"—. -— —U -———- S —— .. - U -a I ~ This structure, for magnificence, beauty, and expenses, exceeded any building that was ever erected. It was built of large stones of white marble, curiously hewn, and so artfully joined together that they appeared like one entire stone. Its roof was of olive wood, covered with gold; and when the sun shone thereon, the re— flection from it was of such refulgent splendor, that it dazzled the eyes of all who beheld it. Its various courts and other apartments were capable of holding three hundred thousand per - sons. It was adorned with 1,453 columns, of the finest Parian marble, twisted, sculptured, and voluted; and 2,906 pilasters, decoratedwith magnIficent capitals. The oracle and sanctuary were lined with massive gold, adorned with em - bellishments In sculpture, and setwith numerous gorgeous and dazzling decorations of diamonds and all kinds of precious stones. In the emphatic language of Josephus, “the Temple shone and dazzled the eyes of such as entered it by the splendor of the gold that was on every side of them.” The multitude on beholding it were struck with bewildering amazement and raised their hands in admiration and astonishment at its wondrous magnificence, as well as to protect their eyes from the effect of its exceeding brilliancy. Nothing ever equalled the splendor of its consecration. Israel sent forth her thousands, and the assembled people beheld, In solemn adoration, the vast sacrifice of Solomon ac - cepted. The flame descended upon the altar and consumed the offering; the shadow and glory of the Eternal proclaimed his presence between the cherubim, and the voice of his thunders told to the faithful of the Craft that the perfectness of their labor wa~ approved. —118— Bright was the hour When Israel’s princes, in their pride andpower Knelt in the Temple’s court; the living flame The accepted sacrifice to all proclaim Brightly the splendor of the Godhead shone In awful glory from His living throne; Then bowed was every brow — no human sight Could brave the splendor of that flood of light That vailed his presence and His awful form — Whose path the whirlwind is — whose breath the storm. ADDRESS TO CANDIDATE Our mystic Temple Is now completed and dedi - cated. You have wrought more than seven years with zeal and fidelity, and have been received and acknowledged as a Most Excellent Master. You are invested with power to travel into foreign countries, work and receive IViaster’s wages, and dispense true Masonic light and knowledge to all uninformed brethren. The temple which we have just completed represents the temple of the present life. The foreign country into which, after its completion, a Mason is expected to travel, is that “undis - covered country from whose bourne no traveler returns.” The wages which he is to receive are the rewards of a well—spent life and the knowl - edge of divine truth, which the Grand Master of the Universe will bestow upon all who have faith - fully performed their task. You have seen the foundations of the Temple laid deep and strong. You have, as an Entered Apprentice, served your Master with freedom, fervency, and zeal; and as a bearer of burdens, brought up from the quarries of Zarthan many a rough ashiar for the buildIng. You have wrought your full time as a Fellowcraft and under the skillful touch of your working tools, these rough ashiars have become perfect ashlars — stones, — 119 —"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"we doubt not, fitted to adorn and beautify our temple. As a Master workman, you have watched with unceasing care the wondrous beauties of the temple Increase wider the skillful hands of the Widow’s Son; and now you have at length seen the object of our hopes completed and the last arch bound together by the rejected though priceless key-stone. We have now dedicated the Temple to the service of the Supreme Being, and by this we are reminded that we should also dedicate our spiritual building — that temple which we have been erecting within ourselves — to the service of the Supreme Being. And al - though we know of a certainty that all earthly things are transient, and that in process of time, even at the best, decay of ages will crumble our magnificent temple into dust, yet we are persuaded, that, if we have erected the temple of our inner life by Square, Plumb-line, and Rule, its foundations shall never fail, and its fabric shall never crumble nor decay. Then let us, my brother, take care that we so labor in the erection of our temple here, that when we leave this, for that far—distant country from whence we shall never return, we may there receive the wages of faithful crafts - men.

CHARGE TO CANDIDATE My brother, your admission to this degree of Masonry Is proof of the good opinion the Breth - ren of this Lodge entertain of your Masonic abilities. Let this consideration Induce you to be careful of forfeiting, by misconduct and in— attention to our rules, that esteem which has raised you to the rank which you now possess. It Is one of your great duties, as a Most Ex - cellent Master, to dispense light and truth to the uninformed Mason; and I need not remind you of the impossibility of complying with this obligation without possessing an accurate ac - quaintance with the lectures of each degree. If you are not already completely conversant in all the degrees heretofore confered on you, remember that an indulgence, prompted by a belief that you will apply yourself with double diligence to make yourself so, has induced the brethren to accept you. Let it, therefore, be your unremitting study to acquire such a degree of knowledge and Information as shall enable you to discharge with propriety the various duties incumbent upon you and preserve unsullied the title now conferred upon you, it being that of Most Excellent Master.

RWM — (r) ROYAL ARCH This degree is indescribably more august, sub - lime and important than all which precede it; and is the summit and perfection of ancient Masonry. It impresses on our minds a belief of the being and existence of a Supreme Deity, without beginning of days or end of years, and reminds us of the rever - ence due to his holy name. It also brings to light many essentials of the Craft, which were, for the space of four hundred and seventy years, buried in darkness, and without a knowledge of which the Masonic character cannot be complete. A Chapter of Royal Arch Masons consists of the following officers, viz: 1. HIGH—PRIEST, whose title is “Most Excel - lent.~’ He represents Joshua, the first High—Priest of the Jews, after their return from the Babylonish captivity. He is seated in the East, and is dressed in a robe of blue, purple, scarlet and white, and is decorated with the ephod, breastplate and miter — the garments and decorations of the ancient High— Priest of the Jews. On the front of the miter, upon a golden plate, is inscribed, in Hebrew characters, Holiness to the Lord. His jewel is a miter. 2. The KING, whose title is “Excellent.’ He represents Zerubbabel, a Prince of Judah, who was the leader of the first colony of Jews that returned from the Babylonishcaptivityto rebuild the Temple. His station is in the East, at the right of the High- Priest, clothed in a scarlet robe, with a crown on his head and a scepter In his hand. His jewel is a level, surmounted by a crown. 3. The SCRIBE, whose title is “Excellent,” represents Haggal the prophet. His station is inthe East, at the left of the High—Priest, clothed in a purple robe, and wearing a turban of the same color.

Yet now be strong, O’Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong O’Joshua, Son of Josedech, the High Priest; and be strong all ye people of the land, saith the Lord; and work: for I am with you, saith the Lord of Hosts: According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: Fear ye not. For thus saith the Lord of Hosts: Yet once it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the sea and the dry land; and will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of Hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine. The glory of this latter house sha]l be greater than the former, and in this place will give peace. In the day will I take thee, 0. Zerubbabel, my ser - vant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee.

The Triple Tauina tri - angle, within a circle is the emblem of emblems of a Royal Arch Mason, typifying the Sacred Name, the Author of Eternal Life. It is worn as a mark of distinction, separating us who know and worship the true Name from those who are ignorant of this august mystery. May you wear it as one who, knowing and believing, may find it the highest hope and faith ever given to man. (Candidates are now seated by Excellent High Priest.) HISTORICAL LECTURE My companions, the mysteries of the Holy Royal Arch are founded uponthe Great and Sacred Name of God, that name which we as Royal Arch Masons are taught to reverence above all others. This degree brings to light many valuable treasures of the craft after they had lain buried in darkness for the period of 470 years, the most important of which are the long lost master’s word and the Book of the Law. The Holy Royal Arch is the completion and ful - fillment of the Master Mason Degree, for herein is received the supreme mysterious symbol which was there lost. The ceremonies of this degree are designed to portray the historical and legendary event connected with the recovery of the masonic treasures upon which this degree is founded. Mter Cyrus had issued his proclamation liberating the Children of Israel, the principal people of the tribes of Judah and 168 169"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Benjamin together with the priests of the Levites departed immediately for Jerusalem where they erected a Tabernacle near the ruins of King Solo - mon’s Temple. In the Sanctuary they set up the altar and there the Grand Council consisting of Joshua, High Priest, Zerubbabel, King, and Hagai, the Scribe, held their convocations. Among those left behincflnBabylonwerethreeof our ancient brothers, who afterwards went up to Jerusalem to assist in rebuilding the House of the Lord. These three Sojourners whom you have repre - sented, discovered and brought to light certain treasures of inestimable value tothecraft,andas a reward were exalted to be the Masters of the Vails. These treasures owe their profound masonic sig - nificance to a series ofcircumstances and events of which you have had a partial account in the Master Mason degree. You will remember that Grand Master Hiram Abiff was slain for refusing to give the Masters Word. The reason why he could not do so is now obvious, for according to the Hebrew law no one alone was permitted to pronounce it except the High Priest, of Israel, and he only within the Holies of Holies. As the personal name of God was considered by the Hebrews too sacredtobeuttered, it was the practice to syllable the Word, J H V H, meaning our Lord, whenever the Tetragrammaton wa~ tobe spoken. When the first Temple was destroyed by the Chaldeans, it is probable that the Ark of the Cove - nant was also destroyed, but masonic information informs us that before the completion of the Temple, King Solomon built a secret vault under the Sanctu - ary, where our Grand Masters held their meeting and entered into a solemn covenant never to give the Masters Word unless they three were present and agreed. In this secret vault they depositeda copy of the Ark of the Covenant and placed within it imi - tations of the pot of manna and Aaron’s rod, and also the Book of the Law. Mter the death of Grand Master Hiram Abiff this secret vault was closed with all its sacred treasures. King Solomon then substituted a word for that which was lost, and that substitute word you received in the Master Mason Degree. And you will also remember that King Solomon vaguely express - ed the hope that the wisdom of future generations might discover and bring to light the true word. That hope you have at last seen realized. (The following may be demonstrated by the High Priest or some designated Companion) This word (indicating) which you see enclosed within the triangle is the ancient Tetragrammaton which is composed of four Hebrew characters, namely from right to left, JAH HE VAH HE, cor - responding in our language to J H V H, and cannot be pronounced as one wordwithouttheaidof vowels which are supplied by those contained in the Chaldeic, the Egyptian, and the Syriac names of Deity, which were engraved on the three sides of the triangle. In the Chaldeic name of Deity BEL is the vowel E, in the Egyptian OM is the vowel 0, and in the Syriac JAH, the vowel A. By placing these vowels in their proper positions in the Tetragram - maton, gives us the true pronunciation of the Great and Sacred Name. The key to the mysterious characters pertaining to this degree, and which you have solemnly sworn never to unlawfully reveal, and to immediately destroy when the same has served its purpose, is thus explained. This key consists of six straight lines bisecting each other at right angles. The figures thus formed, and with the addition of a dot, form twenty-six distinct characters, corresponding with the twenty—six letters of the English alphabet, as follows: 170 171"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"a b C ILiLZDEI7HK K” E17F1r 1 11 z A This is the correct arrangement of the Royal Arch key, as may be noted by comparing it with the characters on the sides and base of the triangle. WORKING TOOLS The Working Tools of a Royal Arch Mason, in addition to the Crow Bar, Picka.xe, and Spade are the Square and Compasses, which have been presented to your view in every degree of Masonry through which you have passed. The square teaches us, as Royal Arch Masons, that God has made all things square, upright and perfect. The compasses are used by operative masons to describe circles. All the parts of the circumference of a circle are equally near to the center. The circle, therefore, is a striking emblem of the relation in which the creature stands to his Creator. For, as all the parts ofthe circumference of a circle are equally near to its center, so are all creatures whom God has made equally near to him. (Note) Optional Use THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE The Equilateral or perfect triangle was adopted by the ancients as a symbol of the Deity — embrac - ing in himself the three stages of time — the Past, the Present, and the Future. Among the Hebrews a yod, or point in the center of an equilateral tri - angle was one of the modes of expressing the incom - municable name of For this reason, the number three has always been held in high esti - mation by the Fraternity. We find it pervading the whole ritual. There are three degrees in ancient craft masonry, three principal officers of a lodge, three supports, three ornaments, three greater and three lesser lights, three movable and three im - movable jewels, three principal tenets, three rounds of Jacob’s ladder, three working tools of a Fellow- Craft, three principal orders of architecture, three important human senses, three ancient Grand Masters. The secrets of a Master Mason, or Mas - ters word, were three times demanded by the three ruffians at the three gates, and the body of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff was buried three times. In short, the allusion to the triangle may be found wherever we turn our steps in Freemasonry. It is held in still higher estimation by all Royal Arch Masons.

ROYAL ARCH BANNER The Royal Arch Banner which shouldbe display - ed in every Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, is com - posed of the four standards used to distinguish the four principal tribes of the children of Israel, who bore their banners through the wilderness, namely Judah, Reuben, Ephraim and Dan; and under each of these standards were assembled three tribes. There were, consequently, four divisions, with three tribes in each numbering 150,000 making 600,000 fighting men or men of war. They marched in a hollow square in traveling through the wilderness inorder 173 172"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"to guard and protect on every side the sacred Ark of the Covenant. The escutcheon or shield on the banner is divided into four compartments by a green cross over which a narrow one of yellow is placed. On each compartment formed by the limbs of the cross is delineated the peculiar emblem of one of these tribes, to wit: in the first quarter, a golden lion on a field of blue, representing Judah; in the second, a man on a field of purple representing Reubin; in the third, a black Ox on a field of gold representing Ephrain and in the fourth, a golden eagle on a field of white representing Dan. Each of these is a component part of the hieroglyphic of the Cherubim, which represents the children of Israel; and they teach us that, in the erection of our second temple of “Holiness to the Lord” as well as in the prosecution of every great and important undertaking, we should display, as did our ancient brethren in the erection of the first temple, the strength and boldness of the lion, the patience of the ox, the swiftness of the eagle, and the intelligence of an upright and perfect man. As a crest, the banner is surmounted by the Ark of the Covenant, guarded by two Cherubim, with their wings touching in the center. LECTURE Q. Are you a Royal Arch Mason? A Q.

You have ascended by regular graduations to the summit of our sublime and royal art. You have been conducted around the outer courts of the temple, viewed its beautiful proportions, its massive pillars, Its starry—decked canopy, its Mosaic pavement, its lights, jewels, and furniture. You have been introduced into the middle chamber, and learned, by the example of our ancient brethren, to reverence the Sabbath day, andtokeep it holy. You have entered the unfinished Sanctum Sancto - rium and there, in the integrity and inflexible fidelity of the illustrious Tyrian, witnessed an example of firmness and fortitude never surpassed in the history of man. You have wrought in the quarries, and exhibited suitable specimens of your skill, and have been taught how to receive, in a proper manner, your Masonic wages. 176 177"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"You have regularly passed the chair, and learned Its important duties — a knowledge of which can alone qualify you to preside over the sons of light. You have been present, and assisted at the com - pletion and dedication of our mystic temple; and for your zeal and fidelity to the Craft, have received the congratulatory title of Most Excellent Master. You have now witnessed ~the moul7nful desolation of Zion, the sack and destruction of the city and temple contained in the Holy of Holies. You have seen the chosen people of God forced by a foreign despot from the pleasant groves and peaceful vineyards of their native Israel, and dragged into captivity on the banks of the (aroff Euphrates. But you have seen those afflicted sons of Zion visited, in the darkest night of their adversity, by a peaceful light from heaven, which guided them over rough and rugged roads to the scene of their former glory. You have seen them enabled by the signet of Eternal Truth, to pass the vails that interposed between them and their fondest hopes. You have seen them successfully engaged in the great and glorious work of rebuilding the house of the Lord. And finally, you have seen the sacred treasures of the first temple brought to light, and the blessed book restored to the longing eyes of the devout Israelites to be the rule and guide — the comfort and support — of the people of God throughout all future time. And, my companions, if, in all these things, you have seen only a series of unmeaning rites — if the spirit of truth has not applied to yeur hearts the morals of these ceremonies, — then, indeed, have we labored in vain, and you have spent your strength for naught. But, I am persuaded to believe better things of you. I trust that you have entered into the spirit of these solemn ceremonies, and understand the full import of these interesting symbols; that all the forms and ceremonies through which you have passed, from the moment you first trod the outer courts of the temple until your final reception within the vails, have impressed deeply on your minds the great fundamental principles of our time-honored institution; for then, and only then, can you justly claim the noble name of Mason; then, and only then, can you feel that friendship, that union, that zeal, and that purity of heart, which should actuate every one who would appropriate to himself the proud title of a workman that needeth not to be ashamed. CHARGED TO THE CANDIDATES My Companions, by the consent and assistance of the members of this Chapter you are now exalted to the sublime and honorable degree of Royal Arch Mason. The rites and mysteries developed in this degree have been handed down, through a chosen few, unchanged by time, and uncontrolled bypreju - dice; and we expect and trust they will be regarded by you with the same veneration, and transmitted with the same scrupulous purity to your successors. No one can reflect on the ceremonies of gaining admission into this Holy Place without being forcibly struck with the important lessons which they teach. Here we are necessarily led to contemplate, with gratitude and admiration, the sacred source from whence all earthly comforts flow. Here we find ad - ditional inducements to continue steadfast and im - movable in the discharge of our respective duties; and here we are bound by the most solemn ties to promote each other’s welfare and correct each others failings, by advice, admonition, and re - proof. As it is our earnestdesire, and aduty we owe to our companions of this Order, that the admission of every candidate into this Chapter should be attended 178 179"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"by the approbation of the most scrutinizing eye, we hope always to possess the satisfaction of finding none among us but such as will promote, to the ut - most of their power, the great end of our institution. By paying due attention to this determination, we expect you will never recommend any candidate to this Chapter, whose abilities and knowledge of the preceding degrees you cannot freely vouch for, and whom you do not firmly and confidently believe will fully conform to the principles of our Order, and fulfill the obligations of a Royal Arch Mason. While such are our members, we may expect to be united in one object, without luke—warmness, inattention, or neglect, but zeal, fidelity, and affection, will be the distinguishing characteristics of our society; and that satisfaction, harmony, and peace may be enjoyed at our meetings which no other society can afford.

Just a short while ago, our Companion was with us, the hand of affection was felt, his words of coun - cil were given for the betterment of our Chapter; he laboured for the advancement of the cause he espoused. But in the midst of life, we are in death, How strange is death to life and yet how sure. The law which dooms each living thing to die what e’er is outward cannot long endure cold hands. We touch thee, perished friend, for we know that years of mutual joy are gone with thee. Yet something still somewhere needs abide of all those being e’er has filled our thought. Thou still livest with us more than empty nought. PRINCIPAL SOJOURNER: SONG: “ABDE WITH ME” 1. AbIde with me, fast falls the eventide.

PSJ — (Offers Prayers) Most Holy and Glorious God, In whose Holy sight centuries are but as days; to whose omniscience that past and the future are but as one eternal present; look down upon Thy children, we implore Thee, and suffer a ray of Thy divine light to penetrate into our hearts, that in them may awaken and bloom the certainty of life, reliance upon Thy promises, and assurance o laplace on Thy right hand.

HP — “Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations; for Thy mercy endureth for - ever.” Companions, the solemn notes that be - token the dissolution of this earthiy tabernacle have again alarmed our outer portals, and we are again called upon to behold that “Narrow house appointed for all living.” Our father who art in heaven hathbeenpleas— ed to take from among us our beloved Com - panion thus sever - ing another link in the fraternal chain that binds us together. As time heals the wound thus in - flicted upon our hearts, letusbeconsoledby the reflection that the love and wisdom of God are equally infinite, and that our sorrow is but the result of the great law of harmony by which everything is conducted to a good and perfect end in the fullness of time. In the midst of life we are in death, and the wiseth knoweth not what a day may bring forth. We live but to see those we love passing from this transitory existence to a land of endless duration. It is appointed that all men once to die, and after death cometh the resurrection. The dust shall re - turn to the earth, and the spirit to the God who gave it. In the grave all men are equal. The lofty thoughts; the gooddeeds; the heroic sacrifices alone survive and bear fruit in the lives of those who strive to emulate them. While nature, therefore, will have its way, let the evergreen symbol of our belief in immortal life remind us that it is only through the eye of faith, can we behold what is to come hereafter, and through a firm reliance upon the divine promises, we shall meet where there is no parting, andwherewe shall enjoy eternal life. — HYMN — (Selected) KING — The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein.

This emblem of mortality, once the abode of a spirit like our own, and now sightless and mute, eloquent, only in the lesson it teaches us. Think of those Companions who but a few days since were among us in all the pride and glory of life. Think of yourselves. Thus will you be when the lamp of your brief existence is burned out. Man’s life is like a flower which blooms to - day, tomorrow is faded, cast aside, and trodden under foot. And when God sends his angelstous with the scroll of death, let us look upon it as an act of infinite mercy and lay down our heads softly and go to sleep. To bear grief honorably and tem - perately, and to die willingly and nobly are the duties of a good man and true Mason. To those of the immediate family and friends who are heart stricken at the loss we have sus - tained, we have but little of this world’s con - solation to offer. We can only sincerely and deeply sympathize with them in their afflictive bereavement. But we can say that He whose mercy endureth forever, looks down with infinite compassion upon them, and will fold his arms of 200 love and protection around those who put their trust in Him, enabling them to say: “The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters. He re— storeth my soul; He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name sake. Yea, though I walk through the shadow of death I shall fear no evil, for Thou art with me, Thy rod and staff they comfort me. Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for - ever.” HP — Let us pray. PSJ — (Offers Prayer) Almighty and Heavenly Father, bestow upon us the riches of Thy ever - lasting grace. Thou alone art a refuge and help in trouble and affliction. In this hour of bereave - ment, we look to Thee for consolation and sup - port. As we mourn the departure of our beloved Companion from the circle of our Fraternity, may we trust that he hath been exalted to a higher brotherhood, and there enjoy that unin - terrupted and unceasing felicity which is allotted to the souls of just men made perfect.
