E.A.’s and F.C.’S, RIGHTS AND DUTIES 6.1. E. A.’s and F. C.’s are not members of the Lodge and are not required to pay dues, nor permitted to participate in the business of the Lodge. They have the right, however, to be present when the Lodge is convened in those degrees, even though their advancement has been stopped by vote or objection. They are also amenable to Masonic law, and charges may be preferred against them and trial had, as provided in this Code. [before 1933] 6.2. CERTIFICATE FOR ADVANCEMENT — No Lodge in this jurisdiction can pass or raise a candidate who has been initiated or passed under another jurisdiction, unless he produces a certificate of good standing and dismission from the Lodge in which he was initiated or passed, if such Lodge is still in existence. However, when there is no record of the fact, or when the Lodge initiating, or initiating and passing him, has ceased to exist, and the records are lost or destroyed, the Lodge to which he makes application may, upon satisfactory proof thereof, receive his petition for advancement. [before 1933] 6.3. CONSENT: WHEN NOT REQUIRED — When one has been initiated, or initiated and passed in another State, and receives his dismissal certificate and removes to this State, he may apply to any Lodge in this Grand Jurisdiction to be advanced therein. In such case he may be elected by unanimous secret ballot to and receive the degrees without the consent of the Lodge which granted him the dismissal certificate. 6.4. EXAMINATION ON DEGREE — An applicant for advancement must be examined as to his proficiency in the preceding degree before advancement. The examination of the candidate should be to the extent of demonstrating that he understands the ceremonial work of the degree, but not necessarily to the extent of qualifying him to confer the degree."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 6.5. PROFICIENCY IN DEGREE — Proficiency in a degree is determined by viva voce vote in a lodge of a higher degree held the same day the examination on proficiency was had. A majority of the members present may declare the candidate proficient. Provided however, that the W. M. may, in his discretion, refuse to pass him on his proficiency and grant further time. The Lodge may refuse to pass a candidate on his proficiency when it sees proper, which refusal automatically grants the candidate further time to become proficient. Proficiency has nothing to do with election for the degrees. [amended 1998] 6.6. OBJECTION — Any member may, in his Lodge, at any time before the obligation, stop the advancement of a candidate for the F. C. or M. M. degree, which objection is in force and effect for thirty days during which the objector must prefer charges against the candidate in accordance with the prescribed rules set forth in the Constitution and Edicts. The failure of the objector to bring charges against the candidate during the prescribed thirty days will be construed as the objection being withdrawn, and if no other objection is made the Lodge may proceed to advance the candidate. The objection may be made in open Lodge or privately to the Master. In no case shall the objector be required to state his reasons for objection during the thirty day period but if charges were preferred they must be specific and in accordance with the Constitution and Edicts; neither shall the Master divulge the name of the member making the objection during the thirty day period. However, if charges are brought by the objector his identity must be revealed and he must follow the rules set forth in the Constitution and Edicts concerning trials. An E. A. or F. C. is entitled to a Dismissal Certificate when he has not been stopped for advancement by objection, when he removes from the territorial jurisdiction of the Lodge granting it, which Certificate is in the nature of a Demit. A majority of the members present may grant such a Dismissal Certificate. If, in case of the removal of an objection for any reason more than a year has elapsed since the last degree was received he shall not thereafter be advanced until an investigating committee appointed by the Master of the Lodge shall have rendered a favorable report to the Lodge at a subsequent"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 61 CD-R — 2001 regular communication and the Lodge by majority vote of the members present approve the favorable committee report. A Dismissal Certificate or transfer cannot be granted while an objection is in force. [amended 1998] 6.7. If one is objected to before initiation, his status is that of one rejected and all fees must be returned to him. 6.8. OBJECTION TO E. A. or F. C. — A Master Mason cannot object to an Entered Apprentice sitting in an Entered Apprentice Lodge of which both are members. Same applies to a F. C. in a F. C. Lodge. 6.9. FORBIDDEN TO WEAR PIN — The wearing of Masonic pins or other Masonic emblems is the prerogative of Master Masons only. 6.10. CHARGES — E. A.’s and F. C.’s are amenable to Masonic law and charges may be made against them in the manner prescribed by the Constitution; but the trial shall be had in that Lodge or degree of which the accused is a member. The statements made by the accused in his trial shall be accepted in the same manner as though he were a Master Mason. In such trial, after the evidence is closed and argument had, a Master Mason Lodge is opened and a verdict rendered and punishment assessed if found guilty as in the trial of a Master Mason. 6.11. RESTORATION — An expelled E. A. or F. C. may be restored to rights and privileges as such. 6.12. LOSS OF LIMB — An E. A. or F. C. who suffers the loss of a leg, foot, arm or hand, or who in any way becomes physically defective, is not necessarily rendered ineligible thereby. His eligibility shall be determined by the Lodge with the approval of the District Lecturer or Assistant Lecturer of that District in writing as provided in the case of applicants for the degree.

When one has been elected on his petition, he may be initiated, passed and raised without further ballot provided he has not been stopped by objection; however, when one has been elected to receive the degrees, and fails to present himself for initiation, or having received one or two of the degrees, yet fails to advance for a period of one year from the date of receiving the degree, he shall not thereafter be initiated or advanced until an investigating committee appointed by the Master of the Lodge shall have rendered a favorable report to the Lodge at a subsequent regular communication and the Lodge by majority vote of the members present approve the favorable committee report. Any member of the Lodge may prevent his advancement by objecting in accordance with Edict 6.6. Should the report of the committee be unfavorable, charges may be made against the brother if the gravity of his conduct justifies. 6.14. ADVANCEMENT—When an Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft affiliates with a lodge on transfer or Dismissal Certificate the one year allowed for advancement shall begin with the date of his affiliation. [amended 1998] 6.15. DEGREES CONFERRED THROUGH ERROR — If for any reason an applicant has received the E. A. or F. C. Degree in a Lodge other than that of his residence without the required questions being asked and answered, and such fact is ascertained before he is passed or raised, the questions required in the first instance must be asked and the same procedure had as hereinbefore provided, before the candidate can be advanced."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 63 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER VII. LODGES AND THEIR CREATION 7.1. EXAMINATION OF OFFICERS — When a proper number of Master Masons present a petition in the required form and apply for examination and recommendation for a new Lodge, it is the duty of the nearest Lodge to the proposed location of the new Lodge to examine the brethren proposed for officers as to their competency to confer the degrees, and to certify to the same, also to inquire as to the character of the petitioners as required by the Constitution. This examination may be held at a regular communication or at a special one called for that purpose. [before 1933] 7.2. RECOMMENDATION — When a Lodge recommends a dispensation for a new Lodge, it must state whether said proposed new Lodge is more than ten miles from the nearest Lodge, or whether it is to be located in a city or town, and said recommendation shall not be considered complete unless such fact is stated. Only a majority vote of the members present is required to make this recommendation. [before 1933] 7.3. TOWN — A town, within the meaning of Section 7, Article 1, of the Constitution of the Grand Lodge, is a “Collection of houses occupied by a number of inhabitants” sufficiently numerous to build up and sustain one or more Lodges; such houses being in close proximity to each other as to constitute a city or town in the common acceptation of these terms and in contradistinction to what is called a thickly settled neighborhood. [before 1933] 7.4. BY WHOM ORGANIZED — All new Lodges shall be organized by some officer of the Grand Lodge, or some competent brother, to be appointed by the Grand Master or Deputy Grand Master for that purpose. [before 1933]"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 7.5. NAMES — In selecting names for Lodges, those as a rule should be chosen having ethical, moral, poetical, historical or Masonic signification."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 65 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER VIII. LODGES: THEIR POWERS AND DUTIES 8.1. BY-LAWS — A chartered lodge has the right to make, alter or amend its by-laws provided, the same are consistent with the Constitution and edicts of the Grand Lodge and the Ancient Landmarks of the Order. The by-laws of a Lodge cannot be suspended, even by unanimous consent. Neither has the Grand Master a right to issue a dispensation to do any act violative of such by-laws. During the recess of the Grand Lodge new or revised by- laws shall be submitted to the Committee on By-Laws who may give tentative approval subject to final disposition by the Grand Lodge at the next Annual Communication. 8.2. LIFE MEMBERSHIP — A lodge may provide in its by-laws for life membership in the Lodge after a specified age or after a specified number of years membership in the Lodge without the payment of Lodge dues, but such life membership does not relieve the Lodge of the payment of the Grand Lodge Dues to the Grand Lodge for such member nor does it entitle him to membership in any other Lodge without payment of dues. [amended 1999] 8.3. FIFTY YEAR AWARD — Any Brother having completed fifty years membership in the Fraternity and now retaining membership in Alabama shall be appropriately recognized by the Grand Lodge. He shall be presented with an appropriate gold Emblem designed and approved by the Grand Lodge. When a Lodge has a member eligible for this award the Secretary of that Lodge shall make application to the Grand Secretary. The award shall be made by the Grand Master or other distinguished Mason appointed by him for that purpose. [1999] 8.4. ASSESSMENT — When a brother holds a life membership and under the by-laws of the Lodge is exempt from dues, he is not exempt from paying any assessment the Lodge"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 may legally levy, unless this exemption was specifically stated in the terms on which the life membership was granted. 8.5. SEAL — A seal is to authenticate documents from the Lodge and no one has authority to affix it to any paper or document unless it is a document from the Lodge and issued by its authority. [before 1933] 8.6. SEAL REQUIREMENTS FOR — A Lodge seal is not required to bear the letters “F. and A. M.” The law requires only that the name and number of the Lodge be engraved thereon. Whether more is placed on it rests in the discretion of the Lodge. 8.7. SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS — A Lodge cannot make a special assessment upon its members except by amendment to its by-laws in the same manner that dues are assessed. 8.8. MEETING PLACE — A Lodge cannot have two meeting places at the same time, even in the same building. 8.9. HALL — A Lodge may join with one or more orders in the purchase of real estate, and the erection thereon of a hall to be used jointly for their several lodge purposes, and in such case it must reserve the right to the undisturbed use of the hall for its regular communications as well as the right to its use when not occupied and used by its co-owners, but such hall cannot be dedicated by the Grand Master for Masonic purposes. A Lodge may rent its hall to another order, or it may rent a hall jointly with such other order, or it may rent a hall from another order, firm or individual, but in all cases it must provide for the use of such hall for Masonic purposes. A Lodge may rent its hall to other people for various purposes, but should use sound discretion and mature judgment as to the use of it. It is preferable and advisable that Masonic halls or lodge rooms be not jointly owned, controlled, occupied or used by other than Masons. [amended 1999] 8.10. HALL — A Lodge should not rent its hall to a labor union; if any member of the Lodge objects to such rental or if"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 67 CD-R — 2001 there are members of the Lodge affiliated with rival labor unions; to do so may possibly lead to unpleasant relations between members of the Lodge. The dignity and honor of the Fraternity demands that the sanctity of the Lodge and respect for its members be the constant care of the brethren. 8.11. LODGE ROOM — The room containing the altar and three stations is the Lodge room. While the banquet hall, preparation and reception rooms are a part of the Masonic building, neither of them can be denominated the Lodge room. 8.12. UNDER DISPENSATION — A new Lodge working under dispensation cannot elect its officers; they must be appointed by the Grand Master. But it has its right and duty to do so as soon as practicable after it receives its charter. The officers so elected hold office until the officers elected at the last regular communication preceding the 24th day of June are installed. A Lodge working under dispensation has the right to issue demits; also the right to try its members. it is not required to have a seal, but may adopt and use one. The foregoing applies only to new Lodges, and does not apply to a Lodge which has lost its charter by fire or other cause and is working under a temporary dispensation, such Lodge must pay dues and elect officers. 8.13. REPORTS — The reports from the subordinate Lodges required by Section 21, Article VI of the Constitution of the Grand Lodge shall be made up to midnight the 14th day of July in each year and said reports shall be forwarded to the office of the Grand Secretary on or before the fourteenth day of August. In addition to said Annual Report, quarterly reports shall be made up to midnight the 14th day of the months of October, January and April respectively and said reports shall be forwarded to the office of the Grand Secretary within thirty days thereafter. Each and all fees for the first degrees as specified in Section 14 of Article VI of the Constitution, and each and every reinstatement for the quarter covered by the report shall be remitted to the Grand Secretary with said report. At the close of business on August 31 any Lodge or Lodges"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 then past due filing with the Grand Secretary the July 14 report shall be reported by the Grand Secretary forthwith to the Grand Master that he may take steps to effect the incoming of those reports then 45 days delinquent as he may be advised. 8.14. WHO INCLUDED — All Master Masons who are members of the Lodge at midnight on July 14th shall be included in the report. 8.15. CHARITY — It is the duty of each Lodge to give special attention to the education of orphans of deceased and indigent worthy Master Masons within its jurisdiction, and to report at each Annual Communication of the Grand Lodge the extent of the charity thus dispensed. All property, both real and personal, and the income derived therefrom is dedicated for charitable purposes as prescribed by law. 8.16. CERTIFICATE AT DEATH — Upon the death of any Master Mason in good standing, and who is a member of a Lodge under the jurisdiction of this Grand Lodge, it shall be the duty of such subordinate Lodge to furnish to the widow or orphans of such deceased member a certificate, under the seal if the Lodge, showing his membership, standing and death, without any application or charge therefor. [before 1933] 8.17. WIDOW AND CHILDREN — When the widow of a Master Mason marries a profane, she thereby forfeits her rights to aid and assistance from the fraternity; but his children are not thereby cut off. The death of the second husband restores such widow to all her rights. The widow and children of a non-affiliate who was entitled to Masonic burial, are entitled to Masonic relief and assistance. The widow and children of a Master Mason who died while under sentence of suspension are deprived of their rights to Masonic relief. The marriage of a Master Mason’s daughter to a profane does not necessarily deprive her of her rights as the daughter of a Master Mason. This is a matter for determination under the facts in each particular case."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 69 CD-R — 2001 8.18.

SAME FAILURE TO REPORT — In all cases where Lodges fail to report action upon proposed amendments, when properly sent to them, as required by the Constitution, the Masters of such Lodges shall be summoned to appear before the Grand Lodge at its next Annual Communication, to give their reasons for failing to report their action or non-action on the proposed amendments. 8.20. APRON — Every subordinate Lodge must give to every E. A. at the time of his initiation a Lambskin or White Leather Apron which shall be his personal property.

LODGES: REMOVAL; CONSOLIDATION 9.1. REMOVAL — For the purpose of removal of a Lodge from its regular place of meeting in a city or town to another place in the same city or town, the W. M. shall cause notice to be given to each member of the Lodge and to appear at a specified regular communication of the Lodge for the purpose of consideration of removal, and, should a majority of the members present vote for removal, they may do so upon consent of the Grand Master. Without each requirement herein set out being complied with, the Grand Master cannot issue a dispensation for a Lodge to hold even a single regular or special communication at any place other than the regular place of meeting. However, in case of destruction of a Lodge rendering it unsafe or insecure for meeting therein, the Lodge may meet temporarily in another suitable building until the above provisions can be carried out. [1950] 9.2. CONSOLIDATION — Two or more Lodges, all being clear on the books of Grand Lodge, may be allowed to consolidate and form one Lodge upon petition to the Grand Lodge or Grand Master; such petition must be signed by a majority of the members of each Lodge present at a meeting especially called for that purpose. The consolidation of two Lodges confers all the rights and powers that the two former Lodges had on the new Lodge and preserves intact all the rights privileges of membership of the two Lodges and members of either of the old Lodges who have been suspended for non-payment of dues may be reinstated in the regular manner by application to the new Lodge."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 [This page left blank intentionally]"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 73 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER X. LODGES: FORFEITURE AND RESTORATION OF CHARTERS 10.1. REPORT — When the charter of a Lodge is subject to forfeiture for any cause, the same shall be reported to the Grand Lodge at any regular communication by the Grand Secretary or any other member, and the Grand Lodge shall take such action thereon as may be proper. 10.2. MAY BE CONTINUED — When in any case the cause for forfeiture has been fully removed, the Grand Master may in his discretion, upon petition of not less than eight members of said Lodge, who were in good standing when the charter was forfeited, and who have not obtained certificates from the Grand Secretary, issue a dispensation to continue work until the convening of the next regular communication of the Grand Lodge, at which time the Grand Lodge shall take such action as it deems proper. 10.3. FAILURE TO PAY FOR CHARTER — A Lodge working under a Dispensation, which has been granted a charter, but fails to pay for and obtain the charter, becomes at once defunct. Members of such defunct Lodge can obtain a certificate from the Grand Secretary in the manner provided for members of other defunct Lodges. [before 1933] 10.4. MEMBERSHIP — When the charter of a Lodge is arrested the standing of the membership thereof is not affected. 10.5. DISPENSATION SURRENDERED — A Lodge under Dispensation which cannot secure a quorum owing to the death or removal of some of its members must surrender its dispensation. [before 1933] 10.6. RESTORATION OF CHARTER — In order to restore the charter of a defunct Lodge the petition therefor must be signed by eight members who were in good standing when the charter"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 was forfeited and have not affiliated with another Lodge. 10.7. RESTORATION — EFFECT — The restoration of the charter of a subordinate Lodge revives the charter of such dormant Lodge, restores all its property and rights of property, both real and personal, unless previously disposed of by the Grand Master. It also reinstates the membership to all their rights and privileges as well as disabilities, existing at the time of forfeiture, except as to such members as during the dormancy of the Lodge have paid their dues to the Grand Secretary and received their certificates when the charter is restored. The Lodge may proceed to elect its officers as soon as convenient and report the same forthwith to the Grand Secretary. 10.8. AFFILIATE FROM LODGE DEFUNCT — When a Mason whose Lodge is defunct, and there is no record of his standing in the records of the Grand Lodge having jurisdiction, desires to affiliate with a Lodge under this jurisdiction, he may make application setting forth the facts above mentioned, and upon the proof of such statements that he was in good standing at the time his Lodge became defunct, be received into membership by application, and the Lodge shall send to the Grand Lodge a report of the proof of membership, and the action of the Lodge thereon for record of the Grand Lodge. Such application shall be received and acted on in the same manner as a petition for affiliation by demit. 10.9. DEGREES AFTER FORFEIT — Where degrees are conferred by a Lodge whose charter has been forfeited, the parties thus receiving the degrees must be regularly “healed” by the Grand Master or the Grand Lodge. [before 1933] 10.10. CERTIFICATE IN LIEU OF DEMIT — When a Lodge forfeits its charter, any member thereof who was in the last annual report of such Lodge before such forfeiture shall be provided with a certificate in the nature of a demit from the Grand Secretary, upon the payment to the Grand Secretary of the amount of Grand Lodge Dues due by the Lodge on the brother. A brother who"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 75 CD-R — 2001 stood suspended for nonpayment of dues at the time of such forfeiture of charter is entitled to the foregoing certificate upon the payment of the amount for which he was suspended. No dues accrue while charter is forfeited. Members of defunct Lodges who were in good standing at the time of forfeiture of charter are not suspended Masons. The certificate from the Grand Secretary is not a demit from the Grand Lodge but from the defunct Lodge. 10.11. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY — When a Lodge forfeits its charter, all its property both real and personal, becomes the property of the Grand Lodge, and a new Lodge afterwards formed at the same place by the same membership has no right to the property of the former Lodge. However, the Grand Secretary may by resolution of the Grand Lodge turn over or donate such property to the said new Lodge, and in such a case it is the duty of the new Lodge to pay such debts as the former Lodge may have owed at least to the extent of the value of the property so acquired. The above does not apply to the restoration of charter of old or former Lodge. The restoration of charter in this case restores its property and its liabilities. It is the duty of the first three officers of a Lodge having forfeited its charter to turn over to the Grand Secretary all the personal property and the deeds to the real property of said Lodge. The Grand Lodge does not assume the liabilities of a subordinate Lodge, but in cases where the said defunct Lodge owes all or in part for any item of its property whether it had executed a mortgage or lien on it or not, the Grand Master, with the assistance of the Grand Secretary, shall take up the matter with the mortgagee, lienee or creditor and fairly adjust such claims, as justice to all concerned would demand, and report their actions at the next annual communication of the Grand Lodge. 10.12. EXPENSES OF PROXY - DEFUNCT LODGE — The proxy of a Master or Warden of a defunct Lodge is not entitled to be paid his expenses for attending Grand Lodge out of the funds of the Lodge unless the by-laws of the Lodge contain a provision to that effect. 10.13. REORGANIZATION — When the charter of any"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 Lodge has been forfeited, and no steps have been taken looking to a restoration of its charter, not less than eight of those who were members of said Lodge in good standing at the time of forfeiture, and who have not accepted certificates from the Grand Secretary, may petition the Grand Master for a reorganization of said Lodge, and he may in his discretion issue to such a Lodge a dispensation to work till the next regular communication of the Grand Lodge, at which time such action shall be taken as Grand Lodge deems proper. The effect of such reorganization shall be that the reorganized Lodge shall be entitled to the name, number and property of the old Lodge, but only those shall be restored to membership in the Lodge as were in good standing at the time of forfeiture and who have not accepted certificates from the Grand Secretary, and shall successfully pass a unanimous ballot at a meeting of the members of said Lodge to be held at a time and place of which reasonable notice has been given, said ballot to be conducted under the supervision of a special deputy of the Grand Master."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 77 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XI. JURISDICTION OVER MATERIAL 11.1. RESIDENT — A resident is one who has a fixed permanent home in this State to which he has the intention of returning when absent. When one actually leaves the State with the intention of remaining away, and changes his residence, and returns, he must live in the State, upon his return, six months before being eligible for membership, no matter how short a time he may have remained away. On the other hand, no matter how long he may have remained away, if such absence was with the intention of returning, he is eligible for membership in this State. Residence is largely a question of intention. Hence, one may have his residence within the jurisdiction of a Lodge, although away from his residence a greater part of the time. [amended 1999] 11.2. RESIDENT OF THE STATE SIX MONTHS — No subordinate Lodge shall initiate any person who has not been a resident within the jurisdiction of this Grand Lodge for six months. Provided, this prohibition does not apply to Military men if stationed within this Grand Jurisdiction at the time the petition is received and acted upon in the Lodge. The above requirement does not apply to ministers actively engaged in their calling and corresponding leaders in other monotheistic religions, a demitted Mason, or an E. A. or F. C. with a dismissal certificate. The six month requirement may be waived by the Grand Master in writing and further if the applicant is a resident of another Grand Jurisdiction recognized by this Grand Lodge, written consent from that Grand Lodge must be obtained before he is eligible for membership. Also any waivers granted shall be reported by the Grand Master at the next succeeding Annual Communication of the Grand Lodge. [amended 1998 & 1999] 11.3. CHANGE OF RESIDENCE — When a person moves from another State into this State with the intention of acquiring permanent residence here, he immediately falls under the jurisdiction of this Grand Lodge, even though he may not be"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 eligible to membership here until the expiration of six months. The Grand Jurisdiction from which he removed has no jurisdiction over him and he cannot be initiated here by obtaining consent from that Grand Jurisdiction. He must reside in this State six months before he can be initiated. Conversely, where a profane removes from this State, this Grand Lodge at once loses jurisdiction over him and no consent can be given to his initiation in another State. [amended 1999] 11.4. MILITARY — Officers and enlisted men of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard, residents of other states, in order to come within the exceptions of the provisions of the edicts of the Grand Lodge as to residence, must be men whose profession is that of arms. Provisions of this edict shall apply to active duty personnel only and not to members of the National Guard or Reserve component of any of the aforementioned military services. 11.5. MASONS MADE IN WRONG STATE — A resident of another State, made a Mason in this State, or a resident of this State made a Mason in another State, are illegally made Masons, and until they are restored to rights and privileges by being healed, a petition for affiliation accompanied by a demit obtained through such procedure cannot be received. 11.6. PETITION BEFORE SIX MONTHS — Should a profane make application for initiation before he has been a resident of the State for six months, his application may be continued beyond six months, or may be returned, together with the fee and such fact and reason therefor noted on the minutes. [amended 1998 & 1999] 11.7. A man desiring to be made a Mason may petition the Lodge of his choice. [Deleted 1999] 11.8.

No action shall be taken on the petition until consent has been received from the Lodge of Rejection. 11.9. HOW EVIDENCED — Consent shall be in writing and under the seal of the Lodge. Consent thus given is a release of jurisdiction to that and all other Lodges, and no future request for consent is required. 11.10. DUTY OF LODGE RECEIVING REQUEST — Lodge receiving request for consent, cannot act on same at that meeting, but it must lie over until the next regular communication, at which time it must be acted on, and Lodge failing to act then, or as soon thereafter as practicable, is guilty of a discourtesy, and subject to charges by the Lodge making the request. A majority of the members present may give consent. A Lodge cannot be required to give its reason for refusing consent. 11.11. PENALTIES — The fact of having been rejected, when and by what Lodge, must be stated in any petition and failure to do so subjects the candidate to charges. Any Lodge violating the provisions of the Constitution and this edict relative to this consent is guilty of unmasonic conduct and subjects itself to discipline by the Grand Lodge, and the loss of its charter. Any brother assisting in conferring the degrees on one whom he knows to have been rejected by another Lodge, and the provisions as to consent have not been complied with, renders himself liable to expulsion."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 [This page left blank intentionally]"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 81 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XII. TIME AND PLACE OF MEETINGS 12.1. REGULAR COMMUNICATION — A Lodge cannot hold a regular communication at any time except on the day and hour provided in the by-laws, and that can be changed only by amending the by-laws. 12.2. FESTIVAL DAYS — The anniversaries of St. John the Evangelist and St. John the Baptist are days for festivals, installations and celebrations. Subordinate Lodges ought not to confer degrees or transact Lodge business on those days. It is not prohibited that degrees be conferred on those days, but it is better not to do so. But if the regular communications fall on those days, degrees may be conferred, and any other business transacted. [before 1933] 12.3. NOT CALLED OFF BEYOND THE DAY — A regular communication cannot be called off or continued to a day beyond the day on which it is held, but it may be done to any subsequent hour of the same day. While a communication cannot be called off from one day to another, this does not mean it may not have a continuous session until after midnight. [before 1933] 12.4. SUNDAY — It is unmasonic for a Lodge to hold a communication, regular or special, on Sunday for the transaction of any business except conducting a funeral or holding a Lodge of Sorrow. And no Lodge should let or lease its Hall on that day except for divine worship. 12.5. SPECIAL COMMUNICATIONS — The W. M. may call a special communication at a regular communication, or at any time he may deem it advisable; but in all cases the object of the call must be stated, and due and sufficient notice be given as to the time. No business shall be transacted at a special communication except that specified in the call. Degrees may be conferred at a special communication called for that purpose, providing the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 candidate had been elected at a regular communication.

Lodge may hold special communication on Sunday for the burial of a brother. The W. M. cannot at a special communication, call another at a later hour same day except for burial of a brother or some important special ceremony. The minutes must show the call and object of a special communication. 12.6. PLACE — The Masonic tradition of “High hills and low vales” does not apply to modern conditions, therefore, Lodges need not hold their meetings in the cellars or upper floors of building. It is sufficient if the place of meeting can be properly and securely guarded against outside observation, hearing or intrusion. [before 1933] 12.7. MAY HOLD DURING GRAND LODGE — Notwithstanding the Master and Wardens of a Lodge may be represented by proxies in the Grand Lodge, they may legally and constitutionally open the Lodge, transact business and confer degrees during the Communications of the Grand Lodge. This, however does not apply to Lodges working under dispensation."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 83 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XIII. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS 13.1. SEVEN MEMBERS PRESENT — To open a Lodge and transact any business there must be ne less than seven Master Masons, who are members of the Lodge, and the Master or one of the Wardens must be included in the number. The District Lecturer or Assistant Lecturer may count in the quorum for opening the Lodge he is visiting if within the Lecturer/Assistant Lecturers assigned District. The Lecturer or Assistant Lecturer will have no right to vote on any regular business. [amended 1998] 13.2. OPENED IN M.M. DEGREE — A Master Mason Lodge may be opened without opening either the E. A. or F. C. Degree. 13.3. MASTER OR WARDEN PRESENT — A Lodge cannot be opened in the absence of the Master and both Wardens. One of these officers must not only be present to congregate the Lodge, but must remain during its entire session. If one of the Wardens be present to congregate the Lodge, he may, however, by courtesy call on a Past Master or Present Master, or Warden of another Lodge to preside, provided he remains in the Lodge room during the meeting of the Lodge. Provided, further, that for the purpose of conducting a funeral, any Past Master of the Lodge may open the Lodge and conduct the funeral in the absence of the three principal officers of the Lodge. 13.4. MASTER NOT DESIGNATED — A Lodge has no right to elect or designate any person to act as W. M. for a special purpose or a special meeting. The regularly elected and installed Master always has the right to preside if present, and in case of his absence or disability the S. W. or J. W. must perform his duties. [before 1933] 13.5. DEMITTED CANNOT PRESIDE — A Past Master who has demitted for six months or longer cannot confer degrees,"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 open a Lodge, preside, or install officers, even though requested to do so by the W. M. or presiding Warden. This holds true even though his petition for affiliation may be pending in that or another Lodge. [before 1933] 13.6. PRAYER — No Lodge should ever be opened or closed without prayer, which should be before declaring the first Lodge opened and before closing. [amended 1928] 13.7. MASONRY AND RELIGION — Freemasonry is a Fraternity and not a Religion. Freemasonry has no plan for salvation, by works or otherwise. Salvation is between man and his God, according to the dictates of his religion. The term “religion” used here does not refer to any denomination, sect or creed. Masonry has no religious dogma other than that it requires a belief in Deity. Any man, good and true, whether he be Christian, Jew, Mohammedan, Parsee, Buddhist, Brahman or Deist may be admitted to Masonry because all these religions require a belief in Deity. [2000] 13.8. SECTARIANISM — A Mason offering prayer in the Lodge may pray to his God observing his own conception of Deity. It is therefore proper and in accordance with Masonic law and tenets for a Mason who believes in the Christ or Jesus to offer prayer in the Lodge in His Name. None should take umbrage because he addresses his prayer to his own conception of Deity. He must use prayer in the Ritual in all ritualistic ceremonies. Any other prayer is out of order in such ceremonies. 13.9. OBEDIENCE TO GAVEL — If members refuse to obey the gavel of the Master he has the right, in order to stop further confusion and disorder, to declare the Lodge closed and take himself and the charter out of the Lodge, even while at labor. [before 1933] 13.10. CONSTITUTION AND PROCEEDINGS — It shall be the duty of the Secretary of each subordinate Lodge under this jurisdiction to keep constantly in his Lodge a copy of the latest"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 85 CD-R — 2001 edition of the Constitution, Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions of the Grand Lodge and also a copy of the last printed proceedings of the Grand Lodge and the latest abridged report. [amended 1998 & 1999] 13.11. SUMMONS — A summons to attend a Communication of the Lodge may be given in either one or more of the following ways: 1st. By the Worshipful Master in open Lodge to all present. 2nd. By the Secretary in writing by order of the Lodge or Master. 3rd. By a member, verbally, when authorized by the Lodge or Master in writing. 4th. By the Tiler, verbally, when ordered by the Master. A summons or notice to the members of the Lodge for a meeting to be held for the trial of a brother should state the purpose of such meeting. [before 1933] 13.12. FAILURE TO OBEY SUMMONS — There is no fixed distance of travel which would excuse a member of a Lodge from obeying a summons. Each individual case must be judged by the circumstances. 13.13. DISOBEDIENCE OF SUMMONS — That the brother has a grievance against the Master or any other brother in the Lodge is no excuse for the willful failure to obey a summons to attend a communication of the Lodge. [before 1933] 13.14. PROXIES NOT PERMITTED — One brother cannot act as proxy for an absent brother. In order to participate in the deliberations of a subordinate Lodge a member must be present. 13.15. EDICTS READ IN OPEN LODGE — All edicts and decisions adopted by the Grand Lodge shall be read in open Lodge as soon after receipt of the printed proceedings as practicable. 13.16. LODGE MAY RECONSIDER — A Lodge has the right to reconsider its action on any business, except petitions for"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 initiation, transfer or affiliation, upon motion of a brother voting in the majority, at the same or communication succeeding the one at which such action was taken, if there is no by-law to the contrary. 13.17. DISBURSEMENTS — All disbursements of the Lodge funds must be made by the Treasurer, by order of the W. M., and the consent of the Lodge, and such consent must be by a majority vote at a regular Communication. 13.18. CONSENT OF LODGE — When a Lodge has voted at a regular communication to do a thing which requires the expenditure of money, this of itself constitutes the “consent of the Lodge” and will authorize the W. M. to order a warrant drawn for the amount required. However, the W. M. should not order such warrant until that “consent” is given. [before 1933] 13.19. ONE CANDIDATE AT A TIME — It is improper to confer the degrees or any part of any one of them on two or more candidates at one and the same time, except the Lectures, Charges, and Proficiency Examination on the Lessons. [amended 1993] 13.20. DEGREES CLOSED SEPARATELY —When a Lodge has been opened in different degrees, each degree must be closed separately, except that the Worshipful Master, when recognizing the lateness of the hour and fatigue of the brethren, and in his sound judgment the interest of the Craft should warrant it, may close by one declaration all the lodges opened at that communication. 13.21. WHO MAY INSTRUCT — The Master may appoint a qualified brother or brothers to teach and lecture candidates and the Lodge and also confer degrees, regardless if whether such brother has held office in the Lodge or not. 13.22. ONLY ALABAMA WORK — No other work than that adopted by the Grand Lodge of Alabama shall be practiced in this grand jurisdiction, except as hereinafter expressly provided,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 87 CD-R — 2001 and no person, not even a member of the Committee on Work shall teach or practice any change therein until adopted by the Grand Lodge; nor can any monitor other than the Masonic Ritual of Alabama be used, and any Lodge using or permitting the use of any Ritual or other book of instruction on Masonic work, published and sent out by any other Grand Jurisdiction, or by any individual, subjects its charter to arrest and discipline by the Grand Lodge. Any brother violating the spirit of either of the foregoing provisions is guilty of unmasonic conduct. 13.23. FOREIGN WORK — A degree team from another jurisdiction may visit a Lodge in this jurisdiction and exemplify the conferring of degrees on their own candidate, using their ritual, but only the ritual approved in this jurisdiction shall be used under the auspices of a Lodge in this jurisdiction. 13.24. MUST HAVE CERTIFICATES — No one shall be permitted to visit a subordinate Lodge in this Grand Jurisdiction, unless he shall present a properly accredited receipt from a regularly constituted Lodge of this jurisdiction or of a jurisdiction with which this Grand Jurisdiction is in fraternal relations, or a certificate of membership properly issued under the seal of the Grand Lodge; provided, the Master may waive such requirements, if he is satisfied such person is a regularly made Mason and entitled to the privilege of visitation. [before 1933] 13.25. LEGAL INFORMATION — No visiting brother can be allowed to sit in the Lodge excepting upon legal information derived in one of two ways: 1st. From personal knowledge that such an one is a M. M., which knowledge can only be acquired after due trial and strict examination, or having sat in regular Lodge of M. M. with the party. 2nd. From the oral declaration of a known M. M. that such an one is a M. M., such declaration being made as an avouchment and in the presence of the party vouched for; provided, that the voucher has personal knowledge acquired as above that the one vouched for is a M. M.

LETTER OR DEMIT — A letter of recommendation under the seal of the Lodge or a demit, is not sufficient evidence that the possessor thereof is a Mason. Before admission in the Lodge he must be vouched for or pass a satisfactory examination. [before 1933] 13.27. SITTING IN OTHER BODIES — The fact of having sat in Chapter, Council, Commandery or Scottish Rite with another is not of itself sufficient evidence to vouch for the latter as a Master Mason. [before 1933] 13.28. EXAMINATION — Strict trial and due examination are difficult terms to define, but means such a trial on the grips, proceedings, etc., and examination as to the secret work which will satisfy the examining brother or committee that the person being examined is a Master Mason. [before 1933] 13.29. NEED NOT BE BY DIRECTION — The trial and examination need not be in the ante-room or by order of the Lodge, nor for admission to the Lodge, but may be at any time and place, so long as they are conducted in a proper Masonic manner. [before 1933] 13.30. OBJECTION TO A VISITOR — A member of a Lodge who is not present at the communication cannot object to a Master Mason in good standing in another Lodge being received as a visitor. Any member of the Lodge present at the communication can object to a visitor from another Lodge being admitted unless such visiting brother is an officer or representative of the Grand Lodge of Alabama or of the Grand Master whose duty it is to make such visit. 13.31. VISITATION BY NON-AFFILIATE — Visitation by a non-affiliate is a privilege subordinate to the rights of the Lodge. He cannot visit a Lodge or join in a Masonic procession except by courtesy of the Lodge. The by-laws of a Lodge may prohibit a non-affiliate from revisiting it. It is the duty of the W."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 89 CD-R — 2001 M. to exclude any visitor when his presence mars the peace and harmony of the Lodge. 13.32. MINUTES; BY WHOM SIGNED — It is not necessary that the minutes of a Lodge be signed by the Master unless so required by the by-laws of the Lodge; the signature of the Secretary is sufficient. [before 1933] 13.33. MINUTES READ — The minutes of a meeting are to be read at the succeeding regular communication, at which time they may be amended and adopted. [before 1933] 13.34. MINUTES AMENDMENTS OF — The minutes can be amended by a majority vote of the Lodge present at the communication at which they were read. [before 1933] 13.35. MINUTES EXPUNGED — The Lodge may, for sufficient reason, expunge any report from its minutes, but the fact that a brother against whom charges were preferred was not convicted is not sufficient reason for so doing. While it is in the power of a Lodge to expunge a part of its minutes, the report of a committee on investigation should not be expunged arbitrarily or without the best of reasons therefor. [before 1933] 13.36. MINUTES - OMISSION SUPPLIED — If on the trial of a brother, the Secretary fails to take down the evidence of a witness, the Lodge may, at its next regular communication, amend its minutes and supply such omission. [before 1933] 13.37. MINUTES INCLUDE REPORT — The report of a committee appointed to investigate charges against a brother should be spread in full on the minutes.

ELECTION OF OFFICERS 14.1. MASTER - ELIGIBILITY — Any one is eligible for election as Worshipful Master who is a member of that Lodge at the time of his election, and who has served as a duly elected and installed Warden of a Lodge in this Grand Jurisdiction, and provided that if in the forming of a new Lodge none of its members have previously served as Master or Warden, as above defined, the Grand Master may appoint such member to be W. M. as he may deem proper. A Master or Warden under charges but not tried, is eligible for W. M. Loss of arm or other limb does not disqualify one for election as W. M. Inability to read or write does not disqualify one for election as W. M. Not being a naturalized citizen does not disqualify one for election as W. M. One who was appointed by the Grand Master and served as Master or Warden of a Lodge under Dispensation is eligible for election as Worshipful Master. 14.2. PAST MASTER DEGREE — The degree of P. M. has nothing to do with the qualifications for office in a M. M. Lodge, and whenever the word Past Master is used in this Code it refers to a Past W. M., and not to one who has taken the P. M. Degree. [before 1933] 14.3. REQUIRING PROFICIENCY — A Lodge cannot enact a by-law requiring a proficiency test in conferring the degrees, in order to be eligible to election as Master or Warden. 14.4. TILER - ELIGIBILITY — The Tiler, as well as other officers, must be a member of the Lodge at the time of his election or appointment. [before 1933] 14.5. A blind brother shall not be elected or installed as Tiler of a Lodge. 14.6. CONDUCT OF ELECTION — While it is not improper for brethren to confer in a fraternal spirit as to the election of officers of the Lodge, it is improper and unmasonic for them to prepare"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 ballots and distribute them with the request that they be voted. [before 1933] 14.7. DISQUALIFIED VOTE — The mere fact that one who has been suspended or demitted voted at an election of officers does not invalidate the election, unless this vote was necessary to and did secure the election of one of the officers chosen. [before 1933] 14.8. ELECTION OF OFFICERS — Is unmasonic to nominate any candidate for office in Masonry, but a subordinate Lodge may by unanimous consent delegate a brother to cast the entire vote of the Lodge for a certain office, but a motion that he cast it for a certain person for such office would be unmasonic. 14.9. INSTALLATION OF OFFICERS — Any officer-elect may refuse to be installed and has the right to demit. No one is a legal officer of a Lodge until he has been installed. The installation of subordinate Lodge officers shall be as soon as practicable after their election, or appointment, but in no case longer than forty-five days after such election or appointment. In no case shall they be installed prior to the 24th day of June. That day, by Masonic custom is installation day, and if officers are not installed on that day, they should be installed thereafter as soon as practicable. The retiring W. M. has the prerogative of installing the officers-elect of his Lodge, but any present or Past Master is eligible to install except that a demitted Past Master cannot, neither can a Warden. The W. M. elect after his own, may install the other officers. Public installations are permissible and any number of Lodges may join in a public or private installation, and the officers of each Lodge be installed at the same time and under the same ceremonies. In case of a joint installation, all the Lodges whose officers are to be so installed may meet with one of the Lodges, and that Lodge shall be opened and remain open in the M. M. Degree until after the installation, when it shall be closed. When a joint public installation is had, the brethren may form a procession, and have a general celebration without a dispensation. At the first regular communication of each Lodge after the joint installation of their officers, the W. M. shall report same in open Lodge and order the Secretary to show same in detail on the minutes. No officer can be installed by proxy. Any officer when reelected need not be installed."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 93 CD-R — 2001 Officer installed with those of another Lodge is legally installed. 14.10. VACANCIES IN FIRST THREE OFFICES — The government of the Lodge is vested in the Master and Wardens, and their respective powers and duties are in force and effect until their successors are elected and installed. They can neither resign nor demit after being installed and neither of their offices can be vacated except by death, expulsion, suspension to a term beyond that for which they were elected, or removal so far away that they are unable to attend Lodge. Should a vacancy occur in the S. W. or J. W. station, the G. M. may issue a dispensation to fill such vacancy by election. Should a vacancy occur in the W. M. station while the S. W. station is filled by a regularly elected and installed officer, no dispensation can be issued to fill such vacancy, as the powers and duties of the W. M. survive in the S. W., he then is the S. W. and Acting Master. Should the office of S. W. be vacant at the time of the vacancy in W. M. station, the J. W. succeeds to powers and duties of W. M. and shall so hold until the vacancy in S. W. station is filled. When neither the W. M. or either of the Wardens have been installed, and any one of them dies, removes in the manner above set out, or refuses to be installed, the G. M. may issue dispensation to elect another brother to fill such office. A Lodge cannot be opened except by the Master or one of the Wardens, but in case of absence of the first three officers, or in case of vacancy in all three stations, the G. M. cannot issue dispensation for other members to open the Lodge; but he, or the Deputy Grand Master may do so, or he may deputize some Past Master to open and preside over the Lodge. 14.11. VACANCY IN OFFICE OF W. M. — In case of a vacancy in the office of W. M., all the rights, powers and duties of the office survive in the S. W. or J. W. as the case may be. This, however, does not create a vacancy in the Warden’s office. He is still Warden and “Acting Master”. [before 1933] 14.12. J. W. DOES NOT SUCCEED S. W. — When the office of the S. W. becomes vacant the J. W. does not succeed to his station, nor has he the right to be elected to such station in case of vacancy therein, as he cannot resign his office of J. W. [before 1933]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 14.13. FAILURE TO BE INSTALLED — A Warden who refuses to be installed, creates a vacancy in that office, which should be filled by appointment, pro tem., or by election after Dispensation granted therefor by the Grand Master. 14.14. DEFINITE SUSPENSION — When a Warden is suspended for a definite period his office is not thereby vacated, and when his sentence of suspension has expired he is thereby reinstated to membership and is still Warden, and must assume his duties as such, provided his term of office has not expired. [before 1933] 14.15. FILLING VACANCY — Vacancy occurring in a minor office may be filled by appointment or election at any time without dispensation. Vacancies in either of the first three offices can only be filled after dispensation from the Grand Master. [before 1933] 14.16. BY-LAW - FILLING VACANCY — A Lodge may enact a by-law providing for filling any vacancy that may occur in any office in the Lodge except the first three, by election, or appointment by the Worshipful Master. In the absence of such by-laws the W. M. may fill such vacancy by appointment. 14.17. VACANCY — When any officer of the Lodge, except the first three, removes from the jurisdiction of the Lodge or is unable to attend to the duties of the office, the Lodge may, by resolution, declare the office vacant and proceed to elect a successor thereto. [before 1933] 14.18. MINOR OFFICER SUSPENDED — When any duly elected or appointed officer, other than the Master or Wardens is definitely suspended by due Masonic trial, it is the duty of the Worshipful Master to appoint some member to act as and for such officer until the expiration of his sentence. If such officer has been expelled or indefinitely suspended, or definitely suspended, beyond the term for which he was elected, then the W. M. shall declare a vacancy and the Lodge shall proceed to fill such vacancy in the manner provided in the by-laws."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 95 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XV. POWERS AND DUTIES OF OFFICERS 15.1. MASTER’S RIGHT TO VOTE — The Master has the right to vote on any proposition before the Lodge, including a change in the by-laws. 15.2. INDUCEMENTS–The laws and ancient landmarks of Freemasonry prohibit the offering of inducements of any nature to obtain members. Masons under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Alabama may properly inquire of a worthy, qualified person ‘if he has ever considered petitioning for membership in Freemasonry?’ This, or a similarly phrased question, is a proper question to determine intent. In addition, the said person shall be advised that ‘he must petition of his own initiative and that he will not be asked to petition.’ Further, he may be told that Masonic literature is available and will be furnished upon request. 15.3. MASTER’S AUTHORITY — No appeal lies from his decision to the Lodge, and he is amenable only to the Grand Lodge, but subject to suspension by the Grand Master, under certain restrictions. It is his privilege to decide all points of order, all questions as to ceremonial work and Masonic law, subject only to the Constitution, Rules and Edicts of the Grand Lodge, the by-laws of his own Lodge, and the ancient landmarks and usages of the Order. 15.4. WARDENS SUCCEED — In case of the absence or disability of the Master, the S. W. first and then the J. W. succeed to all his powers, duties, prerogatives and privileges and must preside unless through courtesy he calls on someone in his stead, and he must sign warrants on the Treasurer for appropriations made by the Lodge while he was presiding. 15.5. ATTENDING GRAND LODGE — Each of the principal officers of the Lodge have the right to attend the Grand Lodge and they possess equal powers and privileges. The payment"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 of the expenses of each is a matter for the regulation of the Subordinate Lodge. [amended 1998] 15.6. MINUTE BOOK — The minute book, records and papers are in the Secretary’s possession and he should hold them until a new Secretary is elected and installed, or they are demanded by the Worshipful Master or the Lodge. It is also his duty to preserve and safeguard the property that passes into his possession and he should see that the minutes or all papers in his possession necessary for the conduct of the business of the Lodge are present when the Lodge is open. 15.7. SECRETARY’S BOOKS — It is improper for the Secretary of a Lodge to have any person not a Mason to keep his books or to conduct his correspondence. If he is unable or unwilling to do this work, he should resign. 15.8. SECRETARY — It is the duty of the Secretary to collect all money due the Lodge, and he is liable to the Lodge for all money so collected, and is entitled to such credits as the Lodge may have authorized. 15.9. SECRETARY — It is the duty of the Secretary to forward a notice of all dues and assessments to each member of his Lodge prior to June 24th of each year and in advance as to allow ample time for said member to respond prior to June 24th of each year. It is the duty of the Secretary to report the full names and mailing addresses of the Master and Secretary of his Lodge immediately after their election to the Grand Secretary. Such addresses shall show street number, post office box number, R. F. D. route and box number and delivery zone where applicable of the city or town in which each resides. 15.10.

LODGE MEMBERSHIP: RECEIVING DEGREES 16.1. ELIGIBILITY — A foreign-born citizen and not naturalized is eligible. Illegitimate birth does not disqualify a man. The fact of being separated from one’s wife does not disqualify. One who can neither read or write is eligible for the degrees. No religious test is required of a candidate, other than that he shall believe in God, the Creator and Governor of the Universe. Neither the indictment by a Grand Jury, nor the conviction for crime in the courts, does not of itself render one ineligible for the degrees; it is a matter for the investigating committee to consider in making its report, and members in balloting. One who is engaged in or participates in any manner in the illegal selling or disposing of intoxicating liquor is disqualified from taking the degrees. A Communist is not qualified to receive the degrees of Masonry. 16.2. DOTAGE — As used Masonically the word “dotage” means feebleness or imbecility of understanding or mind, or physical senility. One possessed of his physical and mental faculties may be made a Mason although old in point of years. [before 1933] 16.3. MADMAN — A non compos mentis is a “madman” within the meaning of Masonic law. Such a person is ineligible to be made a Mason and should he present a petition it should be returned to him as soon as his mental condition is discovered, and if anything concerning the matter has gotten into the minutes they should be made to show clearly why it was returned. 16.4. BLIND — A blind man is eligible to be made a Mason provided he complies with Article VI, Section 7 of the Constitution. 16.5. PETITIONS — A petition for affiliation or initiation must be signed by the applicant, and a petition for initiation must state whether he had ever applied to another Lodge, and if so, to what Lodge, and if he had ever been rejected."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 16.6. RECEIVED ONLY AT REGULAR COMMUNICATION — The Grand Master cannot grant a dispensation for a petition to be received at other than a regular communication. 16.7. RECOMMENDATION A Master Mason should not recommend or vouch for a petitioner unless he can conscientiously do so, as far as he then knows of the character of the petitioner, and is willing that he should be made a Mason. Should he voluntarily recommend an applicant, and then attempt to have him rejected on account of facts known to him at the time, and not upon subsequent events or after acquired knowledge, he is guilty of unmasonic conduct. 16.8. MADE UNDER MISAPPREHENSION —When through misapprehension or ignorance a brother recommends one who has been rejected by another Lodge he may withdraw his recommendation along with the petition. 16.9. PETITION CANNOT BE REFUSED —When the petition is properly presented and accompanied with money for the fee, no brother has the right to object to its being received; nor can a Lodge by a motion refuse to receive it provided it is not barred by other provisions of law. 16.10. PETITIONS RETURNED — A brother recommending the applicant cannot demand that the petition be returned to him. If after receiving a petition and before it is balloted on, the Lodge finds that for any legal reason it is barred from taking further action on such petition, for instance, lack of jurisdiction, physical disqualifications, the lack of six months’ residence in the State by the applicant, or that the applicant was under the age of 21 years at the time of signing the petition, or was in his dotage or of unsound mind, or that the petition was received by mistake, it being intended for another Lodge, in either of such events the petition together with the fee shall be returned and the facts noted on the minutes. 16.11. DEATH; REMOVAL — In case of the death of the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 99 CD-R — 2001 applicant while his petition is pending, or after having been elected, but not having received a degree, the fee shall be returned to the proper person and all the facts pertaining thereto shown on the minutes. When before his petition has been balloted on, the applicant removes permanently to another State, upon his request his petition and the fee may be returned and the reason therefor noted on the minutes. 16.12. INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE — When the petition is received, the W. M. shall refer it to a committee of three Master Masons, who are members of that Lodge, announcing their names in open Lodge. All of which procedure to be shown on the Minutes. The duty of such committee shall be to carefully investigate the character and standing of the applicant and report in writing either favorably or unfavorably within thirty days. The by-laws of a Lodge cannot provide for further time than that, but the Lodge may by a motion, grant the committee further time to make report. Should a member of the committee be unable to agree with the other two, he may submit a minority report. No member can report and sign for another member of the committee. A majority of the committee may report if the other member is absent, which report authorizes the Lodge to proceed with the ballot. When only two of the committee are present and ready to report, but do not agree on the report, the W. M. may appoint another brother as a substitute for the third member of the committee, but such substitute cannot make a report at that meeting, and the report of the committee is thereby postponed until the next regular communication. The committee may by consent of the Lodge withdraw its report, before the ballot is taken, and further time be granted them. 16.13. PETITION DISPOSITION — A petition cannot be withdrawn or disposed of, except by ballot, excepting when it is discovered to be barred by another legal requirement, or the applicant withdraws for conscientious reasons, in which case the Lodge should return all the fees paid except for such degrees as he has received. An unfavorable report does not obviate the necessity for a ballot. The report may be re-referred to the same, or to another committee for further investigation. The W. M. may appoint a standing committee"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"100 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 to procure information and otherwise assist the committees on petitions, also with the prerogative of interviewing the petitioner. 16.14. DEATH OF AVOUCHER — A brother dying or demitting while petition is pending which he recommended, does not affect the validity of the petition. 16.15. FEES FOR DEGREES — The Grand Master cannot issue a dispensation authorizing a subordinate Lodge to confer any one or all the degrees on any person or number of persons for smaller fees than those prescribed in Sec. 14, Art. VI of the Constitution. Fees must be paid by an instrument upon which cash can be immediately obtained, and at least the E. A. fee must accompany the petition. The F. C. and M. M. fees may be paid to the Secretary at any time before advancement. A Lodge cannot loan the amount of the fees back to the candidate after receiving the degrees, if such is done for the purpose of extending him credit, or giving him time to pay for the degrees. A member may loan money to the applicant to pay for the degrees as an individual, but the Lodge is in no way responsible for the payment of such loan. 16.16. MINISTERS — The degrees may, in the discretion of the Lodge, be conferred on ministers, without the payment of fees for the degrees, but every person before taking the first degree must pay the sum of ten dollars for the use and benefit of the maintenance fund of the Alabama Masonic Home; this sum shall be remitted by the Secretary of the subordinate Lodge to the Grand Secretary as may be required by Grand Lodge. A minister in this sense is any person ordained or set apart for the ministry, and who pursues, or has retired from, that profession as his chief vocation. It does not apply to one whose chief business is something else, or who only preaches occasionally. [amended 2001] 16.17. BALLOT SECRECY — It is unmasonic for a brother to disclose how he voted on a petition for affiliation or initiation, or to declare how he will vote on same, and when a candidate is rejected on his petition for either, no brother has the right to demand the name of the brother who balloted against the candidate; nor has any brother"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 101 CD-R — 2001 the right to criticize in open Lodge or elsewhere a brother or brethren who cast an adverse ballot, and the minutes must show the rejection of the candidate. [before 1933] 16.18. CHARACTER DISCUSSED — A brother may disclose to the committee or to the Lodge any information he may have as to why the applicant should not be elected. This is not only his right but his duty. The members may discuss the character and qualifications of a candidate before the ballot is taken, but not afterwards. 16.19. BALLOT ON PETITIONS — Each petition for initiation or affiliation must be balloted on separately, and every member present must vote, and if he should persist in refusing to vote, charges should be preferred against him. However, the W. M. may in his discretion excuse a blind brother from voting, or he may, on request, designate some brother to cast the ballot for him as directed. If on the vote only one black ball appears, the W. M. shall thereupon order a new ballot on the petition taken in the regular manner before the result is declared. A ballot cast under misapprehension or by mistake does not affect the rules of balloting as to results, and the same must be accepted and treated as intentional. 16.20. CANNOT BE RECONSIDERED — A ballot can never be reconsidered after the result thereof has been declared, but if only one black ball appears, it is the duty of the Master, before announcing the result to order a new ballot, but if a black ball appears the second time the candidate must be declared rejected. [before 1933] 16.21. ONE REJECTED MAY RENEW — One rejected on his petition for initiation cannot file a new petition during the same meeting but he may do so at any subsequent communication, which petition must take the same course a the original and all other petitions. However the by-laws of the Lodge may provide that a specified time shall elapse before a petition can be renewed. In the absence of such by-law, the petition may be renewed under the provisions above stated. 16.22. DEGREES IN THREE MEETINGS —Conferring of"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"102 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 the degrees in less than three meetings conflicts with the Constitution of Grand Lodge and the Grand Master is not empowered to grant dispensation to confer the degrees in less than three meetings. 16.23. NEGLECT TO TAKE DEGREES — One who fails or refuses to take the degrees or either of them, or finds it impossible to do so, is not of a matter of right, entitled to have the fee therefor refunded to him. The Lodge may, at its option, retain or refund same. A Lodge may by its by-laws limit the time for a candidate to take the E. A. Degree after election thereto. [before 1933] 16.24. COURTESY DEGREES — A subordinate Lodge may, by request, confer any one or all of the degrees for another Lodge, either in this or another Grand Jurisdiction, and in such cases the membership of the person so initiated or advanced would be in the Lodge for which the work would be done and the fees belong to same. This request must be made in an official way, and the act of the Lodge. Such request from the Master or Secretary or any number of members is not sufficient. No Lodge shall request another Lodge to confer a degree as a courtesy until the requesting Lodge has collected the fee for all of the degrees. All requests for courtesy degrees in other Grand Jurisdictions must be cleared through the office of the Grand Secretary. 16.25. ASSUMED NAME — A Masonic obligation taken by one under an assumed name is binding. [before 1933] 16.26. MAY AFFIRM — A candidate for the degrees of Masonry who entertains conscientious objections to the use of the term “swear” may be obligated and made a Mason, the person conferring the degree on him being authorized to substitute the word “affirm” for the word “swear” wherever it may occur in any of the obligations. [before 1933] 16.27. MASTER MASON NOT EXAMINED — A brother who has been raised is not required to be examined on his proficiency in the M. M. Degree. Yet it is the duty of the W. M. or presiding officer to impress on the newly raised brother the importance of such proficiency."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 103 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XVII. LODGE MEMBERSHIP: DEMIT AND AFFILIATION 17.1. WHO MAY RESIGN OR DEMIT — Any officer, except the first three, may resign HIS OFFICE WITHOUT EFFECTING HIS LODGE MEMBERSHIP. Any member, except a duly installed Master or Warden, whose dues or assessments are paid up to that date or remitted by the Lodge, and against whom no charges are pending, may apply for a demit FROM LODGE MEMBERSHIP either orally in open Lodge, or in writing received at a regular communication, and in no case can he be required to give any reason or excuse for so doing. A demitted Mason shall have the right to visit Lodges, lecture and instruct candidates for a period of six months after the date of his demit. If demitted for a period longer than six months, his right to lecture and instruct candidates, visit Lodges, receive pecuniary aid, or join in any Masonic procession is forfeited so long as non-affiliation continues. 17.2. UNDER CHARGES — When a request for a demit is made in this manner and upon the statement of the Secretary that the applicant has complied with the above requirements, the Lodge must grant this demit without vote of the Lodge. This severs the membership of the Brother instantly, effective upon the date of such request provided that no member at that time offers to prefer charges against the applicant, and if charges are so preferred the demit cannot be granted. Should the Brother be acquitted, he is then entitled to a demit. 17.3. GROUP APPLICATION — Any number of members may apply jointly for their demits, but in no case can a demit be granted if in so doing the membership of the Lodge would be reduced below the required constitutional number. 17.4. WHEN NOT ISSUED — The Secretary has no right to issue a demit until it is properly presented and if there be no objections by the Lodge. A brother convicted of a Masonic offense"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 and sentenced to suspension or a reprimand, is not entitled to a demit until he has received his punishment. A demit cannot be granted on condition that the holder pays his dues or that it be contingent on any other matter. A Lodge cannot require a brother to be examined in open Lodge before granting him a demit. Owing the Lodge money does not debar a brother from taking his demit. 17.5. DUPLICATE OF DEMIT — Where one loses his demit by fire or otherwise, he may apply to the Lodge which granted it for a duplicate, which should be given. But if it is impracticable to issue the duplicate the Lodge should grant a certificate, under seal and signed by the Secretary, that a demit had been granted and had been lost or destroyed. Said certificate shall then have the force and effect of a demit. 17.6. TRANSFER — A person may transfer his membership from one lodge in this state to another Lodge in this State without demitting, in manner as follows: He may make application to any Lodge within this State for membership therein by transfer, a copy of which shall be filed with the Lodge of his membership. Such application shall give his name, age and residence; the name, number and location of the lodge of which he is then a member and shall state that he is at that time in good standing therein, and desires to transfer his membership therefrom to the Lodge to which he is making application. 17.7. RECEIPT OF TRANSFER — Such application shall be received by the Lodge to which made, referred to a committee and take the same course as petition for affiliation on a demit. If elected by the Lodge to which application is made, the Secretary shall so notify the Lodge of which the applicant is a member and thereupon upon the payment of all dues to date and if no charges are pending against him, the Lodge shall issue a transfer of membership to the new Lodge and thereafter the membership of the brother shall cease in the old Lodge and become and be in the new Lodge."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 105 CD-R — 2001 17.8. TRANSFER VALIDITY — The provisions for transfer of membership shall be applicable only between Lodges within this Grand Jurisdiction and those of other Grand Jurisdictions having similar laws. 17.9. The foregoing provisions do not affect in any way the rules and regulations as to issuance of demits and affiliation thereunder, and the same shall be and remain in force, but it is an alternative method for the transfer of membership. 17.10. WHEN EFFECTIVE — A Lodge receiving an application for transfer and electing a brother upon such application, shall not enter such brother’s name on its records as affiliating upon the date of such election, but shall wait until it has received from the Lodge of first membership a formal release of such applicant, and shall thereupon enter the brother as affiliating on the date such release shall bear and not otherwise. The above provisions apply to Fellow Crafts and Entered Apprentices as well as to Master Masons. 17.11. PETITIONS FOR AFFILIATION — A demitted Mason may apply to any Lodge in this State without the consent of the Lodge of his residence. The fact of all previous rejections on such demit shall be shown in the petition. The petition shall be accompanied by a demit on the margin of which the applicant has affixed his signature or by legal certificate in the nature of a demit. 17.12. DEGREES NOT CONFERRED — A brother holding a demit from a Lodge in this or a foreign Grand Jurisdiction can become a member only by affiliation. He cannot be advanced as a profane by taking the degrees, even though he cannot be avouched for and cannot pass the examination. 17.13. WHEN RECEIVED — A petition for affiliation or dual membership can be received at a regular communication only, and the report of the committee on such petition must be made in a subsequent regular communication. [amended 2001]"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 17.14. DISPOSAL OF — A petition for affiliation must take the same course as for initiation by reference to a committee, even though it be the Lodge which granted the demit. The same rules governing balloting, withdrawing, or otherwise disposing of petitions for initiation shall apply to petitions for affiliation also. 17.15. AGE OF DEMIT — A demit is not affected by age. A brother dying while his petition is pending cannot be elected after his death, as death abates the petition and demit and fee must be promptly returned to the proper person. A resident of this State may affiliate with a Lodge in another State and a resident of another State may affiliate with a Lodge in this State. 17.16. RIGHTS OF REJECTED — A brother holding a demit who petitions a Lodge for membership is entitled, if rejected, to the return of his demit, and the fee, if there be a fee, must be returned to him. He does not forfeit his right to apply to any Lodge in this Grand Jurisdiction for membership, notwithstanding the fact that he has been rejected. 17.17. DISMISSAL CERTIFICATE — A profane receives the E. A. degree after having been elected to receive the three degrees and then gets a dismissal certificate, and joins a Lodge in another State, but after two years and before he takes the F. C. degree, he moves back to his former home and applies for affiliation as an E. A. with the Lodge that initiated him, presenting a dismissal certificate from the Lodge in the other State. The Grand Master’s ruling, which was adopted by the Grand Lodge, was that he had no connection with the Lodge he first joined and that the petition should be referred to a committee as in all cases of petitions for affiliation. 17.18. CERTIFICATION OF DEMIT — No demit issued by a Lodge working under this Grand Jurisdiction shall be recognized unless it bears the seal of the Lodge or is accompanied with a certificate of the Grand Secretary that the Lodge which issued it is a just and regular Lodge working under dispensation at"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 107 CD-R — 2001 time of granting same. No Lodge shall receive a petition for affiliation, the demit accompanying same being from a Lodge without the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Alabama, until the Lodge has ascertained from the Grand Secretary that the Lodge issuing the demit is a regular Lodge under the jurisdiction of a Grand Lodge recognized by the Grand Lodge of Alabama. 17.19. DEMITS FROM CLANDESTINE — A person holding a demit from a clandestine Lodge or from a subordinate Lodge in the jurisdiction of a Grand Lodge never recognized by this Grand Lodge is a profane and can only become a member by petition for the degrees in the prescribed manner. A demit issued by a Subordinate Lodge whose Grand Lodge had been recognized by this Grand Lodge, but with whom fraternal relations have been severed, is acceptable provided such demit was issued to the brother before the aforesaid fraternal relations were severed. 17.20. DUAL MEMBERSHIP — A Master Mason can be a member of two Masonic Lodges in this Grand Jurisdiction, provided both Lodges record him as a dual member, and his membership is reported to the Grand Lodge. However, a dual member cannot hold elected office in both lodges at the same time. Furthermore a Master Mason of a Lodge in this Grand Jurisdiction may also hold membership in another Grand Jurisdiction provided this Grand Jurisdiction is in fraternal relations with the other Grand Jurisdiction and that said Grand Jurisdiction legalizes dual membership. [amended 1998] Should a Master Mason holding dual membership within Alabama desire to withdraw his membership from one Lodge, he shall notify the Lodge from which he desires to withdraw his membership of his decision, and if he has paid current dues and no charges are pending against him, the Secretary of that Lodge will carry him as withdrawn and notify the other Lodge in which dual membership was held of the date that the member is no longer a dual member. Should a Master Mason holding dual membership in Alabama and another Grand Jurisdiction desire to withdraw his dual membership from the Lodge in Alabama, he will notify the Lodge from which he desires to withdraw his membership of his"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 decision, and if he has paid current dues and no charges are pending against him, the Secretary of that Lodge will issue a demit marked “Demit from Dual Membership” and send the demit to the Grand Secretary for his endorsement, who will then forward the demit to the Grand Lodge of the other jurisdiction to be forwarded to the other Lodge in which dual membership was held. In no case shall the Secretary issue a demit to a member who holds membership in another Lodge. Any matter that affects membership in either Lodge will likewise affect membership in both. [amended 1996] 17.21. RENUNCIATION — When a Master Mason requests that his name be stricken from the roster of the Lodge of which he is a member, this amounts to a renunciation by him of Masonry, and strips him of all the rights and benefits of Masonry. WHEN A MASTER MASON, WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY RENOUNCED HIS MASONIC MEMBERSHIP, EXPRESSES HIS DESIRE TO BE RESTORED TO GOOD STANDING, HE MUST FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES AS PROVIDED FOR IN EDICTS NO.31.1 THRU 31.4 OF THIS MASONIC CODE."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 109 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XVIII.

AMOUNT FOR REINSTATEMENT — The by-laws of a Lodge may specify an amount, the payment of which will reinstate any of its members from suspension N.P.D., provided such amount does not exceed that for which he was suspended. 18.2. MINISTERS EXEMPT — It is within the discretion of the subordinate Lodge as to whether they shall charge dues against Ministers, actively engaged in, or retired from, their calling. A Minister not actively engaged in his calling is not exempt from fees, as provided in the Constitution. [amended 2001] 18.3. DUES — A by-law increasing the dues, when properly adopted, is not an assessment. 18.4.

Any member in good standing in a constituted Lodge of this Grand Jurisdiction may become a Perpetual Dues Member in that lodge.

D. — At the last regular communication preceding the 24th of June, the Secretary shall before the election of officers for the ensuing Masonic year, read out in open Lodge, the names of all members whose dues remain unpaid for two years or for one year if the by-laws of the Lodge so provide. The W. M. shall then declare each one of them suspended as of midnight, June 23, announcing each name, and order the Secretary to write the word “Suspended N. P.

But it cannot extend the time for a period longer than two years, and any by-law providing for it is null and void. 18.9.

OBLIGATORY — The requirement for suspension for non-payment of dues as above stipulated, is obligatory, though it reduces the membership below the constitutional number. A brother owing two years dues, cannot at the annual communication prevent suspension as above defined, except on the payment of at least one year’s dues, or the Lodge by majority vote of those present remits the same. 18.11. SNPD ERRONEOUSLY — Should the Lodge ascertain that a member had been erroneously suspended for non- payment of dues by reason of clerical error on the part of the Secretary or otherwise, the records of the Secretary shall be corrected and the facts in the case shown on the minutes.

EFFECT OF SNPD — A brother who stands suspended N P D has no right to visit his own or any other Lodge. All his rights dependent upon Lodge membership are suspended until he is reinstated. The widow and children of a brother who dies while suspended N P D have no masonic privileges. 18.15. SUSPENDED MEMBER IN LODGE — If after the Lodge is opened and it should be ascertained that a suspended member is present, the W. M. or presiding officer shall not close the Lodge on such account, but shall order from the Lodge room the suspended member. 18.16. MEMBERSHIP CARD BY MISTAKE — A brother was suspended for N P D for two years and his name read out at the proper time. He later sent the Secretary one year’s dues and through an oversight was given his card. Ruling: The payment of one year’s dues does not reinstate the brother or entitle him to the privileges of the Order, and he is a suspended Mason. If the card was given through oversight it should be recalled. 18.17. VOTE NECESSARY — When a brother has been suspended for non-payment of dues and applies for reinstatement, he shall file a formal request and the Worshipful Master may appoint a committee of three members of the Lodge to make an investigation if he deems it advisable, or shall appoint such a committee upon request of a member of the Lodge, which committee shall, at a subsequent meeting make a report of their findings to the Lodge. If no committee is appointed, such application may be balloted on at the regular communication at which it is received and a favorable vote of a two-thirds majority of the members present shall be required to reinstate the applicant. The Master may submit the question of reinstatement to the members present either by rising vote or secret ballot, provided that if any member present requests the Master to obtain the vote by secret ballot, the vote shall be so taken, using paper ballots instead of the ballot box."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 18.18. CARD TO BE GIVEN — When a suspended member pays to the Lodge the amount of dues in arrears at the time of suspension, or such less amount as the Lodge may by due action have fixed, and the Lodge votes to reinstate him, he shall be furnished with a certificate showing him reinstated to good standing in that Lodge as of the date the vote to reinstate him was taken. The dues to be paid the Lodge from date of reinstatement to next June 24, should be fixed by each Lodge in its by-laws. 18.19. LODGE DEFUNCT — If Lodge is defunct, he may be reinstated by making the necessary payment to the Grand Secretary, accepting a certificate to that effect. A new Lodge at the same place and composed mostly of the membership of the suspending Lodge (now defunct) has no right to accept the suspended brother’s money, for reinstatement. 18.20. NO REINSTATEMENT — A brother cannot be reinstated after death, either by payment of or remittal of his dues. 18.21. DUES REMITTED — A majority of the members present at a regular communication has the authority to remit any part or all the dues owed by one of its members. The remission of such dues, however, does not exempt the Lodge from paying to the Grand Lodge the Grand Lodge dues on the brother. If the Lodge remits the dues of a brother, the Secretary or any one else is without power or right to exact any part of such dues from him. The Lodge must pay the Grand Lodge dues on any of its members to whom it has granted life membership without dues."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 117 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XIX.

If he was a member of a Lodge whose charter was forfeited within six months prior to his death. 3. If he had made application to a Lodge for affiliation which application was pending at the time of his death. 19.9. WHEN NOT ENTITLED — One who has been suspended or expelled and restored to the rights and privileges of Masonry, but not to Lodge membership, occupies the position of a non-affiliated Mason, and therefore not entitled to Masonic burial. [before 1933] 19.10. SNPD — A Mason who stands suspended N. P. D. at the time of his death is not entitled to Masonic burial. 19.11. SUICIDE — The fact that a brother in good standing commits suicide is no reason why he should be denied Masonic burial.

M. presiding at a Masonic burial may call a Past Master or W. M. or Warden, or other qualified brother, to conduct the ceremony. In such cases the minutes should show the W. M. who presided and note the fact that the other brother conducted the services by request. 19.13. WHEN DEFERRED — When it is reasonably impracticable and inconvenient to perform the burial service at the time of the interment of the deceased brother, it may be done as soon thereafter as practicable; but this does not warrant the willful or careless neglect of performing the service at the time of the burial. 19.14. OMISSIONS — In such cases all passages in the service relating to the presence of the body and the open grave should be omitted. [before 1933] 19.15.

The Emergency Fund having been consolidated with the Masonic Home Fund, the Grand Master is authorized to provide for relief as set out in the rules and regulations governing the Emergency Fund, and cause such relief to be charged to and paid from the Masonic Home Fund. 21.2. The Emergency Fund shall consist of the ten cents per capita mentioned in Art. VI, Sec. 21, of the Constitution of the Grand Lodge and such further sums as may from time to time be donated or bequeathed to it or appropriated to it by the Grand Lodge. 21.3. HOW EXPENDED — The Emergency Fund shall be expended under the direction of the Grand Master for the relief of distressed worthy brother Master Masons, their wives, widows, children and other dependent relatives who are members of their households. This relief shall not be granted unless the Mason upon whose membership the claim is based is or was at death and for four years prior thereto, a member in good standing in a Subordinate Lodge of the Grand Lodge; provided that only in extreme cases and for strong reasons the Grand Master may dispense with this requirement of good standing and provided further that all claimants against the fund must be found worthy and provided further that a brother who has demitted in good faith for the purpose of affiliating with another Lodge and has within six months thereafter actually petitioned a Lodge for affiliation, and whose petition therefor was pending at the time of death shall be deemed in good standing within the meaning of this Edict. 21.4. WHO ENTITLED — The name of no person shall be placed upon the list of beneficiaries from this fund until after the Grand Master by careful inquiry among the officers of the Lodge nearest to such person’s residence or among well informed Masons"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 of his community, satisfied himself that such person is both worthy and in distress and entitled to assistance from this fund. 21.5. LODGE ASSISTS — It shall be the duty of the subordinate Lodge in which membership is or was held by the Mason on whose membership claim to relief from this fund is based to pay one-third of the amount agreed upon by the Grand Master and Master of the Lodge as necessary for the relief of such distressed person. In such case, the consent of the Master or presiding Warden is sufficient to bind the Lodge. 21.6. FAILURE TO ASSIST — If such Lodge and its Master or presiding Warden refuse after earnest solicitation by the Grand Master to contribute its one-third of said amount, the Grand Master may in his discretion nevertheless place the name of such person on said list, but he shall report the facts fully to the next communication of the Grand Lodge, with his opinion as to whether such refusal was justified, for such action as the Grand Lodge may see proper to take. 21.7. GRAND MASTER’S DISCRETION — The granting of relief out of this fund is at the enlightened discretion and responsibility of the Grand Master, who shall at each communication of the Grand Lodge place at its disposal all correspondence and information concerning each case. 21.8. GRAND MASTER’S DUTY — In January of each year, the Grand Master shall make diligent inquiry of the officers of the Lodge nearest the residence of each beneficiary as to the continued worthiness and distress of such person, and shall drop therefrom all found to be unworthy or no longer in need of such relief."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 129 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XXII. MISCELLANEOUS 22.1. MASONIC RESEARCH — The Grand Master is authorized to issue a warrant to any club, circle or other organization of Masons formed for the purpose of Masonic research or study, and to permit the use of the word “Masonic” in connection therewith, after he has examined and approved in writing its by-laws and constitution, and is satisfied of the good faith and purpose of such organization. Any change in its by- laws or constitution must also be submitted to and approved in writing by the Grand Master. Such warrant may at any time within the discretion of the Grand Master be withdrawn. [amended 1931] 22.2. PUBLICATION PROCEEDINGS — It is not violative of Masonic law to publish any proceedings of a Masonic body proper to be written, but the propriety of such publication should be governed by sound judgment and enlightened discretion. An abuse of this privilege is a Masonic offense. 22.3. APPEALS FOR ASSISTANCE — Where appeals for assistance, etc., are made by a Lodge to other Lodges, the endorsement of the Grand Master is necessary. 22.4. BUSINESS OR POLITICAL PURPOSES — Masonry is neither a political nor a business organization, and no Mason should use the Order or appeal to the brethren of the Craft, to further his political aspirations or business interest, simply because he is a Mason. However, this edict does not prevent a Master Mason from including his Masonic affiliation as part of a list of organizational memberships and civic activities. [amended 1989] 22.5.

TRIALS: THE TRIBUNAL 23.1. LODGE SOLE TRIBUNAL — A Subordinate Lodge is the sole tribunal having jurisdiction to try a Mason for a Masonic offense and every accused Mason is entitled to such trial. 23.2. A QUORUM IS SUFFICIENT — If a quorum of the Lodge is present, there is a sufficient number present to legally try a Mason. 23.3. WHEN W. M. CANNOT PRESIDE — In a Masonic trial the Master of the Lodge may preside although he preferred the charges, but if he actually engages in or conducts the prosecution, or acts as counsel for the Lodge, or if he be related to the accused by blood or marriage within the fourth degree, he cannot preside and he must retire while the vote is taken. 23.4. WHEN OFFICER CANNOT ACT — No officer of a Lodge shall act as such at his own trial. Another must be appointed to serve as such in that case only to its final disposition. 23.5. RELATIONSHIP — The father, brother, son, uncle, nephew and cousins to the third degree; father-in-law, son-in-law, brother-in-law, uncle-in-law and husband of a first cousin of the defendant or of the brother preferring the charges are disqualified to vote in the trial of a brother, as being of such close relationship “as would likely bias his verdict”. More remote relationship might disqualify if the evidence showed that association together with relationship between the parties was so intimate “as would likely bias his verdict”. The question of disqualification is decided by the Master.

TRIALS: JURISDICTION OF OFFENDERS 24.1. JURISDICTION — Every subordinate Lodge has the right to try its own members, except the Master, except as herein noted, and there is no authority conferred by the Constitution and Laws in this jurisdiction which would authorize the Grand Lodge while in session, or the Grand Master in vacation, to order a change of venue in Masonic trial. 24.2. CONCURRENT JURISDICTION — Where two Lodges have concurrent jurisdiction of a Masonic offense and one Lodge institutes charges, the latter may by unanimous consent dismiss the charges, and the other Lodge may then institute new proceedings, but the first Lodge cannot “transfer” the case from itself to the other Lodge. 24.3. OFFENSE PRIOR TO DEMIT — When a Lodge grants a demit to a brother, who moves into another jurisdiction and affiliates with a Lodge there, and after the granting of the demit the first Lodge prefers charges against the brother for an offense committed before the granting of the demit, and tries and suspends or expels him, such action is legal and proper, although the Lodge to which he then belongs had no notice thereof. It is proper, however, in such case for the Lodge to give the Lodge to which the brother belongs notice of such charges. In any event it is the duty of the Lodge to which the brother belongs to abide by the action of the Lodge trying him, and if suspended or expelled make such order on its rolls. 24.4. CHARGES PREFERRED — It is the especial duty of the Junior Warden to prefer charges for Masonic offenses; but he has the privilege of asking for a committee of investigation, and should the Worshipful Master grant such request he may appoint such committee with instruction to also prefer the charges, if after investigation they deem the facts to justify. It is the duty of any Master Mason to report the unmasonic conduct of any other"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"134 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 brother to the Master or Junior Warden of the offender’s Lodge. Any member of the Lodge has the right to prefer charges, if he be in good standing. 24.5. A Lodge has no right to ignore reports or complaints of unmasonic conduct of one of its members when such complaints are made by a member of another Lodge. The Worshipful Master must either instruct the Junior Warden or appoint a committee to investigate the matter. A Lodge may have a standing committee to investigate complaints as to violations of Masonic law, and in proper cases prefer charges against the offender. Only Master Masons who are members of the Lodge and in good standing have the right to prefer charges. The Worshipful Master may prefer charges himself, but it is preferable that the Junior Warden or a committee, or some other member of the Lodge do so. Neither a nonaffiliate, nor one suspended or expelled, or one suspended N. P. D. has the right to prefer charges. 24.6. SHOULD BE DEFINITE — The charges and specifications should be definite. Some offenses, however, are so often repeated that they become habitual, and if so charged, need not be definite as to the time and place, as in the case of a single offense. [before 1933] 24.7. MAY BE AMENDED — The charges and specifications may be amended at any time before the voting is done, the accused being present; but when amended, the accused may continue the trial, if he is not prepared to meet the amended charges.

Any conduct of a Mason involving “moral turpitude” whether committed before or after initiation, is a Masonic offense. 25.2. MORAL TURPITUDE — The term “Moral Turpitude” means more than “Immorality”; there must be involved in the offense charged not only immorality but also an element of inherent baseness, vileness or depravity. 25.3. Any conduct unbecoming a gentleman and which tends to bring discredit upon the brother and embarrassment or disrepute upon the Fraternity is a Masonic offense. 25.4. BEFORE INITIATION — Only such conduct as involves “moral turpitude” can be made the basis of Masonic charges when committed before initiation. 25.5. INSTANCES OF MASONIC OFFENSES — The following acts by a Mason have been held to be Masonic offenses: (1) To violate any of his obligations; (2) Willfully to absent himself from a communication of his Lodge after receiving a legal summons to attend the same; (3) The use of abusive or insulting language in writing or speaking about a brother; (4) Challenging a brother to fight a duel; (5) Treating his wife cruelly or abandoning her without good cause; (6) Teaching or practicing the doctrine of polygamy; (7) Making illicit proposals to a lady; (8) To have illicit intercourse with another Master Mason’s wife, widow, mother, sister or daughter even though she be not chaste; also any attempt on his part to do so; (9) Disloyalty to his government; (10) A false statement of a material fact willfully made by an applicant in his petition for the degrees is a violation of Masonic"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 Law, for which he may be tried and convicted after the degrees are conferred; (11) General worthlessness and having the reputation of a common liar; (12) Secretly to dispose of one’s property and leave the country without settling his debts or saying anything to his creditors; (13) To be guilty of drunkenness and profanity; (14) To cruelly and shamefully chastise his child; (15) To refuse or willfully neglect to pay back money borrowed from the Lodge; (16) To speak evil of a brother Master Mason or his family; (17) For the Secretary to fail to pay over all the money to the Treasurer or to be behind in his accounts and not promptly make good the deficit; (18) To tell a newly made Mason that he had thrown away his money in being made a Mason; (19) To threaten that a Lodge shall not grow any more; (20) To declare that he did or will blackball a candidate for the degrees of Masonry, because the Lodge had previously rejected a friend of his or for any reason which does not affect the character and qualifications of the candidate; (21) Aiding in illicit distilling of intoxicating liquors or beverages; (22) To engage in the business of illegally retailing spirituous, vinous or malt liquors; (23) To swindle one’s creditors or anyone else, whether they are Masons or not; (24) For a Mason to become a Communist, to embrace, practice or espouse the Communistic theory. A brother found guilty of such offense shall be expelled from all rights and privileges of Masonry. [amended 1998 & 1999] 25.6. BELIEF IN DEITY — In Alabama it is a Masonic offense for a Mason to declare that he does not believe in Deity. 25.7. MASON DRUNK — Any Mason who visits another Lodge or attends his own, or joins in a Masonic procession or"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 137 CD-R — 2001 funeral while intoxicated, is guilty of unmasonic conduct and should his own Lodge, upon being informed of such conduct, fail or refuse to prefer charges against him, the said derelict Lodge should be reported to the Grand Master or the Grand Lodge for discipline. 25.8. PARODIES — Any Lodge on being informed that any member of same has printed or written or authorized the printing or writing of any parody on the unwritten work, or has displayed or read same publicly shall prefer charges against the brother for a shameless desecration and flagrant violation of his obligation. 25.9. A Secretary who refuses to turn over the books and property of the Lodge which he may have in his custody, by order of the Worshipful Master and the consent of the Lodge, is guilty of unmasonic conduct and subject to charges. 25.10. USE OF WORD “MASONIC” — Unless recognized and approved by resolution of the Grand Lodge, the use of the word “Masonic” in connection with any club, organization, business or publication constitutes a Masonic offense. 25.11. CRIMINAL LAW — A violation of the criminal law of the State may or may not be a Masonic offense, according to the facts and circumstances, and an indictment thereof is not of itself sufficient reason why charges should be preferred. Charges should be preferred in the event of a supposed unmasonic conduct, regardless of indictment. A plea of guilty, Nolo Contendere, or guilty verdict may be used as evidence to convict a Mason of unmasonic conduct. 25.12. TO PLEAD USURY — It is not unmasonic to plead usury to a debt. [before 1933] 25.13. DUES OR ASSESSMENT — The non-payment of dues or a special assessment made by the Lodge is not of itself a Masonic offense, nor can it be made so by the by-laws of the Lodge. The only penalty for non-payment of dues is suspension."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"138 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 25.14. CARD PLAYING — It is not unmasonic to play cards, but a Lodge may by its by-laws prohibit its members from playing for money. [before 1933] 25.15. NON-PAYMENT OF DEBTS — It is not unmasonic to plead the statute of limitations in any case in which it is allowed to be pleaded by the laws of the State, but the refusal of a Mason to pay his just debts, when he has the ability to do so, is a Masonic offense. The mere refusal to pay a debt is not a Masonic offense. There may be an honest contention as to its justice or validity. The contention, however, should be in good faith, and not a mere pretext. 25.16. BANKRUPTCY — Taking benefit of the bankrupt law is not of itself, a Masonic offense."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 139 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XXVI. TRIALS: PROCEDURE 26.1. ADDRESS OF ACCUSED — When the address of the accused is unknown, the Lodge may, after a reasonable time, and after due diligence by the Lodge, through its Secretary or committee, to ascertain his whereabouts or address, proceed with the trial as if the accused were present. 26.2. ACCUSED FAILS TO APPEAR — When the notice required has been given and the accused willfully fails to appear, he may be tried as if present, but some brother should be appointed to defend him. 26.3. POSTPONEMENT — The granting of a postponement of a trial is within the sound discretion of the Master, and after being granted should not be questioned or discussed. 26.4. CIVIL COURT — Subordinate Lodges are not required to defer action against a member because a prosecution may be pending against him in the civil courts. Whenever charges are preferred against a brother the Lodge must proceed to hear the case under the rules prescribed. 26.5. ACCUSED IN PRISON — When the accused is in the penitentiary or prison, he should have the notice and be permitted to have counsel, and if he has none, the W. M. should appoint counsel to represent him, and he should have the right to submit his own testimony, if he so desires. 26.6. SOJOURNER OR RESIDENT — A sojourner or resident brother is one who is residing or living within the jurisdiction of the Lodge other than that of his membership, and that is true whether the Lodge of his membership is in the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Alabama or any other Grand Lodge."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 26.7. CHARGES WITHDRAWN — Charges having been submitted to the Lodge, cannot be withdrawn except by unanimous consent. Where there is more than one specification, the brother may plead guilty to one and the others may be withdrawn, but only by unanimous consent. If such consent is not given, the trial must proceed under the specifications to which no plea of guilty was entered. Where unanimous consent is given, the brother cannot be tried on the specifications withdrawn. They may, however, be made the basis of a new charge, in which case notice must be given as required by the Edicts and Constitution. 26.8. TRIAL ON COPY — Where the original charges have been lost or mislaid, the trial may be had on a copy of the charges. A true copy is to all intents and purposes as good as the original. 26.9. CHARGES — The recommendation of a Committee appointed to investigate complaints against a brother that no charges be preferred does not deprive a member of the Lodge of the right to prefer charges against the brother if such member sees proper to do so. 26.10. SETTLEMENT — When one or more members of a Lodge have been guilty of unmasonic conduct in a personal difficulty or variance, the settlement of such differences between the parties does not necessarily relieve the offending party or parties from liability to charges and trial. 26.11. DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL — A member of the committee or a brother preferring the charges should not act as counsel for the accused. 26.12. JOINT TRIAL — More than one Master Mason may be tried at one time if the offense is the same, provided there is no objection from the Lodge or from any of the defendants. In case of objection they must be tried separately. A Fellow Craft or Entered Apprentice cannot be tried with a Master Mason, though the offense be the same and no objection is interposed."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 141 CD-R — 2001 26.13. OUT OF JURISDICTION — When a brother commits a Masonic offense outside the territorial jurisdiction of membership Lodge, the Lodge where the offense committed shall draw up the specifications on which it deems charges should be based, and under the seal of the Lodge forward same to membership Lodge. On receipt of said specifications, the membership Lodge shall either prefer charges on the specifications received, and notify the other Lodge of its action, or request the other Lodge to proceed with the trial. Should the membership Lodge neglect to make reply in either manner as defined, the Lodge where offense committed at the expiration of thirty days is vested with sole jurisdiction over the matter. In all cases the trial Lodge shall officially notify the membership Lodge of the result of the trial. The action of the trial Lodge is conclusive except subject to appeal, and suspension or expulsion by trial Lodge means not only from the fraternity, but from the Lodge of which he was a member. 26.14. TRIAL OF ONE SUSPENDED — Upon the presentation of charges against one who has been suspended, the Lodge should appoint a committee to take the testimony. A copy of the charges, notice of the appointment of the committee, and the day set for them to take the testimony must be served on the accused at least ten days before the day set. The committee must meet at the appointed time, examine the witnesses presented by both the prosecution and defense, reduce their testimony to writing, and report same back to a Lodge called for trial. The Lodge so met must have the testimony read and determine the cause as in other cases. A brother who stands suspended for unmasonic conduct is subject to charges and trial for unmasonic conduct other than that for which he was suspended. This is true, although an appeal to the Grand Lodge is pending from the first offense. 26.15. TRIAL OF ONE SNPD — A brother who stands suspended for non-payment of dues is subject to charges, and when a brother against whom charges have been preferred has been suspended N. P. D., he has not the right to appear in open Lodge while so suspended, but the trial must be conducted in the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 same manner as one suspended for unmasonic conduct. One suspended N. P. D. has no right to appear even as a witness. His deposition must be taken as a profane. 26.16. TESTIMONY — The testimony of a Mason is taken upon his honor. The testimony of a Mason may not be directly impeached, but it may be contradicted by other witnesses to a given statement of facts. 26.17. PLEA OF ACCUSED — If both the accused and counsel for the Lodge announce ready for trial, counsel for the Lodge arraigns the accused by reading the charges aloud, to which the accused in person enters a plea to each specification and to each charge. How can the accused plead? The accused may plead guilty, not guilty, self-defense or set up matter in extenuation, excuse, or justification."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 143 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XXVII. THE EVIDENCE 27.1. BURDEN OF PROOF — The burden of proof is on the Lodge. The guilt of the accused is not to be presumed, but it must be established by competent and satisfactory evidence, before a conviction can be had. 27.2. RECORD OF EVIDENCE — A court reporter who is a Master Mason in good and regular standing may be appointed Secretary pro tem and record the evidence, verbatim, at a Masonic trial, regard being had to the requirements of Con, Art. VII, Rule 9. [Sec. 3] 27.3. PROPER NOTICE — It is not necessary that the notice given by the committee of the time and place of taking testimony be signed by the Secretary or attested by the Seal of the Lodge. 27.4. TESTIMONY OF E. A. OR F. C. — When an Entered Apprentice is a witness in a Masonic trial his testimony shall be taken in an Entered Apprentice Lodge. When a Fellow Craft is such witness his testimony shall be taken in a Fellow Craft Lodge, and the testimony of either shall be taken in the same manner as that of a Master Mason. 27.5. TESTIMONY OF PROFANES — The testimony of persons not Masons and of Masons suspended or expelled may be used in a Masonic Trial. Such testimony may be taken in writing or by electronic means before a committee appointed by the Master to take depositions. The witnesses shall swear or affirm to the testimony before a person authorized to administer oaths. The accused, his counsel, and counsel for the Lodge, having proper notice of the time and place of said deposition, has the right to cross examine the witness. 27.6. TESTIMONY OF NON-RESIDENT — When"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"144 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 testimony of Masons living in a foreign jurisdiction is desired, written interrogatories may be propounded to such witnesses and filed with the W. M. to which the opposite party may file cross-interrogatories. The interrogatories, both direct and cross, should then be sent to the Secretary of the Lodge in whose jurisdiction the witnesses reside. The deposition of the witnesses should then be taken in open Lodge, and returned by the Secretary under the seal of the Lodge. The time in which cross-interrogatories may be filed should be prescribed by the W. M. and notice thereof given. The opposing party may, at the time of filing cross- interrogatories, demand notice of the time and place of taking depositions. The testimony of persons not Masons and of Masons suspended or expelled living in another jurisdiction to be used in a Masonic trial shall be taken in the same manner as those of non- resident Masons, except it is not taken in open Lodge. 27.7. ACCUSED MAY TESTIFY — The accused has a right to testify in his own behalf. [before 1933] 27.8. WIFE A COMPETENT WITNESS — When a brother is accused of abusing or whipping his wife, on a trial therefor his wife is a competent witness, and should be examined as any other profane. [before 1933] The wife is a competent witness for or against a defendant, even though her husband be the prosecutor or injured party. 27.9. WHEN NOT — A wife is not a competent witness for or against he husband except in cases of mistreatment of her by him, nor is a divorced wife a competent witness as to matters and things which transpired during coverture, except in some cases. [before 1933] 27.10. CONFESSIONS OR ADMISSIONS — A voluntary confession or admission made by the defendant may be introduced as evidence against him on his trial for a Masonic offense. 27.11. TESTIMONY OF PREVIOUS TRIAL — The"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 145 CD-R — 2001 admissibility of testimony on a former Masonic trial is governed by the analogous rules of evidence that prevail in law courts of the State. 27.12. CONVICTIONS OF CRIME — The conviction of a Mason in the criminal courts of a crime and the testimony on which it was based may be offered in evidence upon any trial of such Mason in the Lodge and shall be given such weight as the Lodge in its fair judgment may deem it entitled. Upon being informed of such conviction in the criminal courts it shall be the duty of the Master and the Junior Warden to cause the facts of such conviction to be investigated by a committee or otherwise and to cause charges to be preferred if the facts justify."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 [This page left blank intentionally]"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 147 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XXVIII. TRIALS: THE DECISION 28.1. ARGUMENTS — There should be no argument or discussion of a case either by counsel or the brethren after the prosecutor and defendant have retired that the Lodge may take a vote. They are, however, permissible before, and the prosecution has the right to close the argument. 28.2. EVERY MEMBER MUST VOTE — Every member of the Lodge, who is present and can hear the evidence submitted at a trial, not only has the right, but is required, to vote, except where there is such near relationship by blood or marriage to the accused, or to the brother preferring the charges as would likely bias his verdict, or where by bias, prejudice or a fixed opinion is made known at outset of trial by a member and in such event he shall not sit on trial, and shall retire from the Lodge when the vote is being taken. [1950] 28.3. VOTE — The vote of the Lodge shall be taken by a call of the roll, 1st, as to the guilt of the defendant; 2nd, as to the punishment. The Master should vote. 28.4. ROLL CALL — The vote on the trial of a brother shall be taken as follows: Each brother present shall sign his name to a roll before the Lodge is opened. Each and every name on such roll shall be called each time a vote is taken. It shall be the duty of the Worshipful Master to ascertain that every brother present has signed the roll. 28.5. MEMBER CHANGING VOTE — After the Lodge has closed at which a brother has been tried, and either acquitted or convicted, the members cannot change their vote. A brother may, however, change his vote before the result has been declared. However, even after the result has been declared, either as to guilt or innocence, or on the assessment of punishment, a member voting in the majority may make a motion to reconsider, and it"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"148 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 may be reconsidered; provided, no brother has left the hall. [before 1933] 28.6. VOTE AGAIN — In the event no motion is made to reconsider, the Master may, upon being informed that the brethren did not understand the question, again put the question without a motion; provided, no brother has left the hall. [before 1933] 28.7. WHAT MINUTES MUST SHOW — In case of a trial the minutes of the Lodge shall show the number of members present and the number voting aye and nay on each question."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 149 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XXIX. APPEALS 29.1. APPEALS — Questions affecting the action of a subordinate Lodge in a Masonic trial can come to and be heard by the Grand Lodge only through an appeal. An appeal while pending does not vacate or supersede the sentence; such sentence is in force and effect and is final unless reversed by the Grand Lodge. 29.2. GRAND LODGE ACTION — Upon appeal the Grand Lodge or during its recess the Grand Master, may reverse or affirm the judgment or order, or modify the same in any way, including a finding of guilty when acquitted by the subordinate Lodge or the increasing or decreasing of the penalty on a finding of guilty; or may, if necessary and proper, order a new trial. 29.3. VOID CONVICTION — When on appeal the Grand Lodge holds the proceedings in a trial to be null and void, for reason of the trial Lodge’s failure to comply with the legal requirements, the membership of the accused brother is undisturbed. 29.4. ERRONEOUS CONVICTION — The Grand Lodge’s reversal of sentence of suspension or expulsion restores the brother to the rights and privileges of Masonry, but not to membership. His status is then that of an unaffiliate and is entitled to the Grand Secretary’s certificate of restoration. 29.5. RESTORATION — When the Grand Lodge reverses a judgment of acquittal by a subordinate Lodge and suspends or expels the brother, he cannot be restored to rights and privileges by the subordinate Lodge, but by the Grand Lodge only. 29.6. REVERSAL — When on appeal the Grand Lodge reverses a sentence of indefinite suspension or expulsion and affixes a definite suspension, such action by the Grand Lodge restores the brother to rights and privileges of Masonry upon the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"150 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 expiration of the period of suspension fixed by the Grand Lodge, but does not restore him to membership at the expiration of such sentence. 29.7. CERTIFICATE AND VISITATION — The Grand Secretary should issue to the brother a certificate of restoration in the nature of a demit stating the facts thereon. The brother’s status is then that of an unaffiliate and may petition the Lodge of his choice on such certificate. He also has the right of visitation, subject to the courtesy of the Lodge as applies to all unaffiliated Masons. 29.8. RESTORATION PENDING APPEAL —Pendency of appeal does not prevent a Lodge from restoring the appellant to rights and privileges, but if he is reinstated, the appeal should be withdrawn. 29.9. DEATH OF APPELLANT — When before an appeal and the transcript has reached the Grand Secretary’s hands the appellant dies, the appeal is thereby abated, and the fact of the death and abatement shall be shown on the minutes of the Lodge. If, at the time of death, the brother’s appeal has reached the hands of the Grand Secretary, the trial Lodge shall immediately notify the Grand Secretary, who shall file such notice with the appeal and enter thereon an order of abatement. 29.10. NOT ENTITLED TO DEMIT — He is not, however entitled to a demit if an appeal is pending under such sentence, even though the sentence has expired. He must await the disposition of the appeal before the demit can be granted. 29.11. NEW TRIAL — A Lodge may, by a majority vote, order a new trial, based either on newly discovered evidence, or on the fact that a conviction was had upon evidence subsequently found to have been false. The motion to grant a new trial must be made at a regular communication, or soon thereafter, and a new trial may be ordered by a majority of the members present at such communication, the resident members of the Lodge having been"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 151 CD-R — 2001 duly notified of the pending motion, provided, however, if the accused was acquitted and no appeal was taken, he cannot be tried again for the same offense. [1950] 29.12. WHEN ORDERED — When a brother is tried and found guilty and sentenced, and the trial Lodge closed, the Lodge cannot be called together again and the error corrected, but a new trial may be ordered. 29.13. TRANSCRIPT — On all appeals the “transcripts” should be made out with care; each paper copied in a neat and legible hand, and the whole fastened together in their proper order, and the style of the case marked on the papers, and directed to the Grand Secretary. It must be affirmatively shown by the transcript that every requirement of the Grand Lodge has been complied with or that it has been waived. The failure of the Secretary of the subordinate Lodge to make up and forward the transcript as required does not nullify the appeal. The Grand Lodge may, and should, on application, order same sent up without delay."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"152 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 [This page left blank intentionally]"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 153 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XXX. THE PUNISHMENT 30.1. PUNISHMENT — The by-laws of a Lodge cannot provide for a fixed punishment for designated offenses. No punishment can be assessed except after a legal trial and conviction, and the only way to fix punishment is by roll call of the members; and when a brother is found guilty he must be either expelled, indefinitely suspended, definitely suspended or reprimanded, although the accused pleads guilty, and the Lodge failing to fix punishment of a brother found guilty is grossly derelict of duty. Should the Lodge fail to fix a punishment on the first roll call, the W. M. shall put the vote again, and so repeat it until the Lodge either fixes a punishment or the W. M. becomes convinced that the Lodge will not vote a punishment; in which case it is the duty of the W. M. to take an appeal to the Grand Lodge, and pending such appeal the status of the accused is that of a brother under charges. The W. M. may refuse to assess an inadequate punishment and appeal to the Grand Lodge. After the punishment is fixed, the Lodge cannot remit or reduce such punishment. It, however, may for good cause grant a new trial by a majority vote of those present. When punishment is not proportionate the Grand Lodge will on appeal order new trial. Only a majority vote of the members present is required to convict or affix punishment of a reprimand. A two-thirds vote is necessary for expulsion or suspension. A Lodge can forgive a brother before conviction, but has no right to forgive him after he has been tried and found guilty. 30.2. NOT CONTINGENT — Suspension must be either indefinite or for a definite period. It cannot be imposed to continue until the happening of a particular event. 30.3. MODE OF FIXING — In fixing the punishment of a brother found guilty in a Masonic trial the W. M. shall put the question first on expulsion, and if two-thirds of the members present do not vote for expulsion, he shall then put the question on indefinite suspension. If this does not receive the required"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"154 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 two-thirds vote, he shall put the question of definite suspension. Should the Lodge by a two-thirds vote refuse to suspend the brother for as long a term as the W. M. names in the question, he shall put the question on definite suspension for a shorter term, and then still a shorter term as his judgment may dictate. Should the Lodge refuse to expel or suspend the brother, they shall then by a majority vote order a reprimand. It is permissible for a member to name the period of definite suspension in a motion. In the event the Trial Commission finds an accused guilty and affixes the penalty of reprimand, the following procedure shall be followed to impose the penalty. The acting Chairman of the Trial Commission who presides over the trial shall write a reprimand and send it to the District Lecturer of that district, who shall read the reprimand to the sentenced member without addition or amplification at a regular communication of that lodge with no other visitor present, within sixty days. The District Lecturer delivering the reprimand shall notify the Chairman of the Trial Commission of the date the reprimand was delivered. [amended 1996] 30.4. EFFECT — The practical effect of definite suspension, indefinite suspension and expulsion is the same in each instance, the only difference being as to the time. In every case the brother is deprived of the rights and privileges of Masonry during the period of his sentence. But when a brother has been definitely suspended and his term of suspension shall have expired before the next session of the Grand Lodge and on appeal the Grand Lodge reverses the sentence by an acquittal, the Secretary of the Lodge shall set out the fact of such acquittal on the page of the minutes showing the brother’s conviction. 30.5. REPRIMAND — Where the punishment is a reprimand and the brother refuses to attend to receive his punishment, he is thereby deprived of the rights and privileges of Masonry until he receives his punishment, or appeals from the conviction. 30.6. RESTORED IMMEDIATELY — When one is suspended for a definite length of time, and his term of suspension"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 155 CD-R — 2001 expires, he is, immediately, restored to all the rights and privileges of Masonry, as well as to Lodge membership. 30.7. OTHER BODY SUSPENSION — The suspension or expulsion of a Mason from his membership in any of the so- called “higher-Masonic bodies” is not a suspension or expulsion from his subordinate Lodge."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"156 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 [This page left blank intentionally]"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 157 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XXXI. RESTORATION AND REINSTATEMENT 31.1. PROCURED — In order to be reinstated to membership one who has been expelled or indefinitely suspended, must first be restored to the rights and privileges of Masonry, and then proceed regularly by petition, which petition must be referred to a committee and be balloted on following report of committee as in all cases of petitions for affiliation. A quorum of the Lodge can reinstate, but the vote must be unanimous. If rejected, he may renew petition as often as he may desire. 31.2. RESTORATION TO R. AND P. — When a petition to be restored to the rights and privileges of Masonry is received, it shall be read in open Lodge at a regular communication. The W. M. shall then fix a day for action thereon, which must be at some regular communication, and order the Secretary to notify or summon every resident member of the Lodge to be present. 31.3. At the meeting so had, an affirmative vote by two- thirds of the members present taken viva voce, restores the brother to the rights and privileges of Masonry; and if restored he may then at that meeting, or at a subsequent meeting, petition the Lodge for membership therein; such petition to be considered and acted upon in all respects as a petition for affiliation, by reference, to a committee. If he does not petition for membership, or if he is rejected, then the Lodge shall on request, issue him a certificate of restoration, under the seal of the Lodge, which certificate shall have the same force and effect as a demit, as per form here set out. If the application for restoration be refused, he may renew it at any subsequent communication unless restricted by individual Lodge By-laws. One restored to rights and privileges has status of an unaffiliated Mason. FORM “This is to certify that _______________ was a member in good standing of ______________________ Lodge No. ____ and was"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 _________________ from said Lodge, but has been restored to the rights and privileges of Masonry, and is entitled to petition for membership in any Lodge.” (To be signed by the Master and countersigned by the Secretary, with seal of Lodge attached.) 31.4. WHO CAN RESTORE — No subordinate Lodge except that one which suspended the Mason can restore him to the rights and privileges of Masonry. If such Lodge is defunct he must apply by petition to the Grand Lodge, and if restored by the Grand Lodge he is entitled to a certificate in the nature of a demit from the Grand Secretary. 31.5. SOJOURNER, RESTORATION — When the defendant was a sojourner and was suspended or expelled by a Lodge other than that of which he was a member, he must make application to the Lodge which tried him for restoration to the rights and privileges of Masonry, and if that is granted he may then apply to his own or any other Lodge for membership. 31.6. RESTORATION BY GRAND LODGE —When a brother who has been suspended by a subordinate Lodge for a definite period, and on appeal the Grand Lodge suspends him indefinitely, he can be restored to the rights and privileges of Masonry only by the Grand Lodge and not by the subordinate Lodge."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Digest of Edicts, Decisions and Resolutions 159 CD-R — 2001 CHAPTER XXXII IMPEACHMENT OF WORSHIPFUL MASTER 32.1. A Lodge cannot try its W. M., but any five of its members may file with the Grand Master, impeachment proceedings against the W. M. for official misconduct, as provided in Art. VI, Sec. 25 of the Constitution. The members of a Lodge have the right and it is their duty to investigate any creditable rumor reflecting on the character of their W. M., and if their findings justify it, any five of them may institute impeachment proceedings, by preparing the petition for impeachment, setting out in same the full specifications of the W. M.’s misconduct, and each of the five go before the Secretary of the Lodge and sign the petition. The Secretary shall then endorse thereon that the five petitioners signed the same in his presence, and that each one is a member of that Lodge and in good standing. He shall then affix the seal of the Lodge thereto and forward it promptly to the Grand Master, who will then proceed in the matter as set out in Sec. 25, Art. VI of the Constitution. The Suspension of the W. M. on report of three investigators suspends such W. M. from his office, and he is thereby prohibited from presiding or discharging any duty as W. M. The impeachment of a W. M. affects his official status only, and his membership is undisturbed. After his impeachment is made final he is subject to charges as any other Mason for unmasonic conduct before he was W.

RIGHT TO OFFICE — Any officer of the Lodge has the right to hold office and perform the duties pertaining thereto while charges are pending against him. Provided however, that the W. M. has no such right when through impeachment proceedings he is suspended from his office by the Grand Master. Any officer or member of a Lodge is eligible for election to office while charges are pending against him.

They are intended as helpful guides to the Lodge, the officers, the witnesses and the parties and here, following the provisions relating to Trials and Appeals, is deemed a convenient place to set them out. A Masonic code for the guidance and direction of a whole Grand Lodge jurisdiction would be incomplete with- out a chapter upon the subject of trials and appeals. The following has, therefore, been prepared with a special view to that subject, and the directions and decisions of the Grand Lodge have been implicitly followed as a matter of course, so far as the Constitution has given directions, and the Grand Lodge made decisions, and it is hoped that the forms here presented will be found of service to the Masters of Lodges whenever they may be called upon to preside during a Ma- sonic trial, the most unpleasant duty that a Master can be required to perform, and yet one of the most imperative. Sev- eral authorities have been consulted and the chapter has been prepared with all the care and deliberation that could be bestowed upon it. THE CHARGE The first step to be taken towards a Masonic trial is, of course, to prefer charges, or make a complaint. The charges and specifications must be made in writing and over the signature of a Master Mason, or by a committee of the Lodge. The important requisites of a charge or complaint are that it should be brief and yet comprehensive; clearly defin- ing the nature of the offense charged, and specifying, with reasonable certainty, the time, place and circumstances of its commission. Thus: To the Worshipful Master, Wardens and Brethren of Orien- tal Lodge, No. 164:"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Suggestions for Trials 163 CD-R — 2001 The undersigned, a Master Mason (or the undersigned, a committee appointed by the Worshipful Master for that purpose), charges Brother A. B. with immoral and un-Ma- sonic conduct: First Specification—In that the said A. B. on the 1st day of April, last past, in public, in the county of Jackson, was in the state of intoxication from the use of spirituous liquors, in violation of his duty as a Mason, and to the scan- dal and disgrace of the Masonic Fraternity. Second Specification—And also, in that the said A. B., on the 1st day of April, last past, and on divers other days before the exhibition of this complaint, in the county of Jackson, was in a state of intoxication from the use of spiri- tuous liquors and other intoxicating drinks, in violation of his duty as a Mason, and to the scandal and disgrace of the Masonic Fraternity; and it is hereby demanded that the said A. B. be dealt with therefor, according to Masonic law and usage. The complaint must be signed by the brother who pre- fers the charges, or by the committee appointed by the Mas- ter. Or the form for a different offense may be thus: To the Worshipful Master, Wardens and Brethren of Orien- tal Lodge, No. 164: The undersigned, a Master Mason (or the undersigned, a committee appointed by the Worshipful Master for that purpose), charges Brother A.

Second Specification—And also, in that the said A.

B. be dealt with there- for, according to Masonic law and usage. The complaint must be signed as before directed. These forms might be indefinitely multiplied, but these will be sufficient to show the manner, and the importance of specifying with reasonable certainty of the time, place and circumstances under which the alleged offense was commit- ted, that the accused may know what he has to answer, and how to prepare for his defense. For, of course, he cannot be charged with one offense and convicted of another. It may be amended, however, before the vote. The main object in view in having several specifica- tions is to be certain to have some one of them that will conform to the proof, where there may be doubt as to what the proof will be. Thus, if a party was charged with saying that Masonry was a humbug, a cheat and a swindle, it would not do to prove that he said he did not believe in Masonry or that he said it was not a good institution. Either would be a Masonic offense, but then the proof must sustain the of- fense with which the party is charged, and not some other offense. Technicalities are not so much regarded in a Ma- sonic trial as they are in courts of law; but still the proof must sustain the particular charge made and not un-Ma- sonic conduct in general. THE EVIDENCE The charge having been presented to the Lodge, the Master appoints a day for the trial, sufficiently distant to notify the party, to summon the witnesses and to have time to take testimony. The notice which the party must have is"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Suggestions for Trials 165 CD-R — 2001 specified in Article VII of the Constitution, and need not be repeated here. If the witnesses are Master Masons, their evidence is heard in open Lodge; if they are not, the Master appoints a committee to take their testimony in writing and it must be sworn to before some person authorized to admin- ister oaths; but the testimony of a Master Mason is taken upon his honor as a Mason. All persons are competent witnesses in a Masonic trial that are competent in a civil court at common law, and none others. This rule excludes idiots, madmen and children who are too young to be sensible of the obligations of an oath. But this rule only requires of them a belief in God, and that He will punish falsehood. It excludes persons who are ren- dered infamous by reason of their conviction of certain crimes, as perjury, subornation of perjury, etc. All others are compe- tent witnesses in a Masonic trial, as they are in a trial before a civil tribunal. But all persons are not equally credible; and while a person may be simply competent; yet he may be of such notorious bad character that one would not believe him on oath. Witnesses who are not Masons may be im- peached, but a Master Mason cannot be impeached. He may be contradicted by the introduction of witnesses to prove a contrary state of facts to that alleged by him, but no witness can be allowed to testify that they would not be- lieve him on oath. Each party has the right to introduce testimony, the accuser to sustain his charges, and the accused to show his innocence. To procure the attendance of witnesses on ei- ther side, no process is necessary if the witness is a Mason and a member of the Lodge, because he is bound to obey the summons of the Master when the Lodge is called to- gether for the trial, and he will then be present to give his testimony. But if he be a member of some other Lodge in the same city, the Secretary of the Lodge in which the trial is to take place will issue his summons under the seal of the Lodge requiring his attendance. If the witness be not a Mason, his"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"166 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 attendance before the committee appointed to take testi- mony must, of course, be voluntary. If a witness whose testimony is desired be a Mason and a Member of some other Lodge in the same town or city, and he refuses to attend and give evidence, charges should be preferred against him in the Lodge of which he is a mem- ber. Or, if he be an unaffiliated Mason, charges may be pre- ferred against him in any Lodge in the same Lodge jurisdic- tion. But if the witness resides in the jurisdiction of another Lodge his evidence may be taken by a committee. THE TRIAL When the time set for the trial arrives, the Master opens the Lodge in the third degree. In the jurisdiction of Alabama the trial is had before the Lodge itself, and at a Communica- tion especially notified for that purpose (Cons., Art. VII, Sec. 3, Rule 6) at which no visitors are admitted except wit- nesses and counsel, and then only in case they are Master Masons. If the party on trial be not a Master Mason, the exami- nation takes place in the highest degree to which he has attained, but none are admitted except Master Masons and the accused; after the examination is closed the Lodge is opened in the third degree and the final decision is made. When the Lodge is open, the trial proceeds if both parties are ready. But either side may ask for a postpone- ment, and it is the duty of the Master to grant it if good cause is shown. If the Master refuses to grant a postpone- ment, the party that asks for it should request that a memo- randum of the fact be entered upon the minutes, together with the reasons for which it was asked, and it is the Master’s duty to require this to be done, that it may go before the Grand Lodge in case an appeal should be taken. So, also, if either party objects to any testimony that is proposed to be introduced, and the Master overrules the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Suggestions for Trials 167 CD-R — 2001 objection, it is the duty of the Master, at the request of the party to cause the objection and his decision thereupon to be entered upon the minutes, that it may go up to the Grand Lodge upon the record. And if the Master rules out any testimony that is proposed to be introduced, the same course must be taken if the party wished to obtain the benefit of it. If both parties announce themselves ready, the accused is considered as pleading “not guilty”: without any formal pleading to that effect, but he may if he choose, plead spe- cially, admitting some specifications and denying others. Or he may admit some of the specifications, or even the whole charge, and set up matter in extenuation or excuse, or justifi- cation. But he may adduce the same matter in evidence, and have the benefit of it under the general plea of “not guilty”. Both parties being ready, the trial proceeds. The testi- mony to sustain the charge is first introduced. The evidence is heard in open Lodge, where witnesses are Masons; and where they are not Masons, by deposition, as already indi- cated. The testimony to sustain the charge having been heard, accused introduces his testimony, and then testimony in rebuttal may be heard if any is considered necessary. The testimony having all been delivered, the accused may be heard in argument by himself, or by his counsel, if he have one, and he be a Mason. The case being closed, both parties withdraw—the accuser and the accused. But if the charges are drawn up and presented by a committee appointed by the Master for that purpose, the committee does not withdraw, as it is merely the instrument through which the Lodge has acted, and is supposed to be as uninterested in the matter as any other member of the Lodge. Upon every trial, the Secretary of the Lodge shall write down, in a fair hand, the whole of the evidence in the case that is proper to be written. (See Art. VII, Sec. 3, Rule 9.) The question is then, upon each specification, to be distinctly put by the Master to every member present, be-"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"168 Alabama Masonic Code - November, 2001 CD-R — 2001 ginning with the youngest, “Is the accused guilty or not guilty?” The answer shall be given standing and in an au- dible manner, and the Secretary shall record the answer (Rule 10.) If the accused be found guilty, the Lodge by vote shall assess the punishment due to the offense. There are four modes of punishment known to Ma- sonry, as the result of a trial, if the brother be found guilty. These are Reprimand; Definite Suspension, or for a certain period of time; indefinite Suspension, and Expulsion. As the Master has to put it to the Lodge what punishment shall be assessed after the brother has been found guilty, he shall put it upon the highest, Expulsion, first. If the requisite ma- jority will not assess that, then upon the next, Indefinite Suspension, and so on down, until the Lodge has agreed upon the proper one. In this jurisdiction Rule 12 of Article VII, Sec. 3 of the Constitution requires that all cases of suspension or expul- sion two-thirds of the votes of all the members present shall be required. The case having terminated and the decision of the Lodge entered upon the record, the accused ought to be notified of the result as early as possible, in order that he may take an appeal to the Grand Lodge, if the decision should be against him, and he chooses so to do, within the time prescribed in the Constitution. The notice should be given by the Secretary of the Lodge, and under the seal of the Lodge, and if conveyed to him in any other manner it is not official notice. Any member of the trial Lodge who feels aggrieved by the decision of the Lodge upon the trial of any brother may take an appeal to the Grand Lodge; but the manner of taking the appeal, and the time in which it must be done, is fully laid down in the Constitution, in Article VII, that it need not be enlarged upon here."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Suggestions for Trials 169 CD-R — 2001 APPEALS If an appeal is taken to the Grand Lodge, either by the brother accused, or any other member of the Lodge, the Secretary of the Lodge shall immediately record the appeal and transmit to the Grand Lodge at the next Communication thereof, the appeal, certified under his hand and the seal of the Lodge (Cons., Art. VII, Sec. 3, Rule 16.) Of course, a full and perfect record of the whole case must be sent up, be- cause the record must show affirmatively that every requi- site of the Grand Lodge has been complied with. And in sending up appeals to the Grand Lodge the transcript should be made out with care; each paper should be copied in a neat and legible hand and the whole fastened together in their proper order and the style of the case marked on the papers and directed to the Grand Secretary. Otherwise, the Grand Lodge will order the proceedings returned and order the Subordinate Lodge to send them up in regular and constitu- tional form.
