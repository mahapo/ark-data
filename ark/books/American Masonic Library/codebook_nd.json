THE GENERAL HEADS, viz.: I. Of God and Religion. II. Of the Civil Magistrate, supreme and subordinate. III. Of Lodges. IV. Of Masters, Wardens, Fellows and Apprentices. V. Of the Management of the Craft in working. VI. O f Behavior, viz.: 1. In the Lodge while constituted. 2. After the Lodge is over and the Brethren not gone. 3. When Brethren meet without Strangers, but not in a Lodge. 4. In Presence of Strangers not Masons. 5. At Home and in the Neighborhood. 6. Towards a strange Brother. I. Concerning God and Religion A Mason is obliged, by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist nor an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancient Times Masons were char g’d in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves; that is, to be good Men and true, or Men of Honor and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasions they may be distinguish’d; whereby Masonry becomes the Center of Union, and the means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remain’d at a per petual Distance. II. Of the Civil Magistrate, supreme and subordinate. A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers , wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concern’d in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior Magistrates; for as Masonry hath been always injured by War, Bloodshed and Confusion, so ancient Kings and Princes have been much dispos’d to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their Peacea bleness and Loyalty, whereby they practically answer’d the Cavils of their Adversaries, and promoted the Honor of the Fraternity, who ever flourish’d in Times of Peace. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanc’d in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy Man; and, if convict’d of no other Crime, though the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time being , they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his relation to it remains indefeasible. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" III. Of Lodges A Lodge is a Place where Masons assemble and work: Hence that Assembly, or duly organiz’d Society of Masons is called a Lodge, and every Brother ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its By Laws and the General Regulations. It is either particular or general, and will be best understood by attending it, and by the Regulations of the General or Grand Lodge here - unto annex’d. In ancient Times, no Master or Fel low could be absent from it, especially when warn’d to appear at it, without incurring a severe Censure, until it appear’d to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hinder’d him. The Persons admitted Members of a Lodge must be good and true Men, free - born, and of mature and discreet Age, no Bondsmen, no Women, no immoral or scandalous Men, but of good Report. IV. Of Masters, Wardens , Fellows and Apprentices. All Preferment among Masons is grounded upon real Worth and personal Me rit only; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to Shame, nor the Ryald Craft Despis’d; Therefore no Master or Warden is chosen by Seniority, but for Merit. It is impossible to describe these things in Writing, and every Brot her must attend in his Place, and learn them in a Way peculiar to this Fraternity: Only Candidates may know that no Master should take an Apprentice unless he has sufficient Imployment for him, and unless he be a perfect Youth, having no Maim or Defect in his Body, that may render him uncapable of learning the Art of serving his Master’s Lord, and of being made a Brother, and then a Fellow - Craft in due Time, even after he has served such a Term of Years as the Custom of the Country directs; and that he shou ld be descended of honest Parents that so, when otherwise qualifi’d, he may arrive to the Honor of being the Warden, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Master of all the Lodges, according to his Meri t. No Brother can be a Warden until he has pass’d the part of a Fellow - Craft; nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand Warden until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor Grand Master unless he has been a Fellow - Craft b efore his Election, who is also to be nobly born, or a Gentleman of the best Fashion, or some eminent Scholar, or some curious Architect, or other Artist, descend’d of honest Parents, and who is of singular great Merit in the Opinion of the Lodges. And for the better and easier, and more honorable Discharge of his Office, the Grand Master has the Power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular Lodge, and has the privilege of acting whatev er the Grand Master, his Principal, should act, unless the said Principal be present, or interpose his Authority by a Letter. These Rulers and Governors, supreme and subordinate, of the ancient Lodge, are to be obeyed in their respective Stations by all the Brethren, according to the old Charges and Regulations, with all Humility, Reverence, Love and Alacrity. V. Of the Management of the Craft in Working. All Masons shall work honestly on Working Days, that they may live creditably on Holy Days; and the time appointed by the Law of the Land or confirmed by Custom, shall be observed. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The most expert of the Fellow - Craftsmen shall be chosen or appointed the Master or Overseer of the Lord’s Work; who is to be called Master by those that work under him. The Craftsmen are to avoid all ill language, and to call each ot her by no disobliging Name, but Brother or Fellow; and to behave themselves courteously within and without the Lodge. The Master , knowing himself to be able of Cunning, shall undertake the Lord’s Work as reasonably as possible, and truly dispend his Goods as if they were his own; or to give more Wages to any Brother or Apprentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Mason receiving their Wages justly, shall be faithful to the Lord and honestly finish their Work, whether Task or Journey; nor put the Work to Task that hath been accustomed to Journey. None shall discover Envy at the Prosperity of a Brother, nor supplant him, or put him out of his Work, if he be capable to finish the same; for no man can finish another’s Wor k so much to the Lord’s Profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the Designs and Draughts of him that began it. When a Fellow - Craftsman is chosen Warden of the Work under the Master , he shall be true both to Master and Fellows, shall care fully oversee the Work in the Master’s Absence to the Lord’s Profit; and his Brethren shall obey him. All Masons employed shall meekly receive their Wages without Murmuring or Mutiny, and not desert the Master till the Work is finish’d. A young er Brother shall be instructed in working, to prevent spoiling the Materials for want of Judgment, and for increasing and continuing of Brotherly love. All the Tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge . No Labo rer shall be employ’d in the proper Work of Masonry ; nor shall Free Masons work with those that are not free, without an urgent Necessity; nor shall they teach Laborers and unaccepted Masons as they should teach a Brother or Fellow. VI. Of Beha vior. 1. Behavior in the Lodge While Constituted. You are not to hold private Committee; or separate conversation without Leave from the Master , nor to talk of anything impertinent or unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens , or any Brother speaking to the Master; Nor behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn; nor use any unbecoming Language upon any Pretense whatsoever; but to pay due Reverence to your Master, Wardens and F ellows, and put them to Worship. If any Complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the Award and Determination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent Judges of all such Controversies (unless you carry it by Appeal to the Grand L odge ) and to whom they ought to be referr’d unless a Lord’s Work be hinder’d the meanwhile, in which Case a particular Reference may be made but you must never go to Law about what concerneth Masonry , without an absolute necessity apparent to the Lodge. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 2. Behavior After the Lodge is Over, and the Brethren Not Gone. You may enjoy yourselves with innocent Mirth, treating one another according to Ability, but avoiding all Excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his Inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occasions call him, or doing or saying anything offensive, or that may forbid an easy and free Conversation; for that would blast our harmony, and defeat our laudable Purpose. The refore no private Piques or quarrels must be brought within the Door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about Religion, or Nations, or State Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholic Religion above mention’d; we are also of all Nations, Tongues, K indr’d, and Languages, and are resolv’d against all Politics as what never yet conduc’d to the Welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This Charge has been always strictly enjoined and observ’d; but especially ever since the Reformation in Britain, or the Dis sent and Secession of these Nations from the Communion of Rome. 3. Behavior When Brethren Meet Without Strangers, But Not in a Lodge Formed. You are to salute one another in a courteous Manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freel y giving Mutual Instruction as shall be thought expedient without being overseen or overheard and without encroaching upon each other, or derogating from that Respect which is due to any Brother, were he not a Mason; For though all Masons are as Brethren u pon the same Level, yet Masonry takes no Honour from a Man that he had before; nay, rather it adds to his Honour, especially if he has deserved well of the Brotherhood, who must give Honour to whom it is due, and avoid ill Manners. 4. Behavior in Presence of Strangers Not Masons. You shall be cautious in your Words and Carriage, that the most penetrating Stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated, and sometimes you shall divert a Discourse, and manage it prudently for the Honour of the Worshipful Fraternity. 5. Behavior at Home, and in Your Neighborhood. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise Man; particularly not to let your Family, Friends and Neighbors know the Concerns of the Lodge, &c., but w isely to consult you own Honour, and that of the ancient Brotherhood, for Reasons not to be mention’d here. You must also consult your Health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from Home, after Lodge Hours are past; and by avoiding of Glutto ny or Drunkenness, that your Families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working. 6. Behavior Towards a Strange Brother. You are cautiously to examine him, in such a Method as Prudence shall direct you, that you may not be impos’d upon by an ignorant, false Pretender, whom you are to reject with Contempt and Derision, and beware of giving any Hints of Knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in Want, you must rel ieve him if you can, or else direct how he may be reliev’d; you must employ him some Days, or else recommend him to be em - 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" ploy’d. But you are not charged to do beyond your ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, that is a good Man and true, before any other poor People in the same Circumstances. Finally, All these Charges you are to observe, and also those that shall be c ommunicated to you in another way cultivating Brotherly Love, the Foundation and Capestone, the Cement and Glory of this ancient Fraternity, avoiding all Wrangling and Quarreling, all Slander and Backbiting, nor permitting others to slander any honest Brot her, but defending his character, and doing him all good Offices, as far as is consistant with your Honour and Safety, and no farther. And if any of them do you Injury you must apply to your own or his Lodge; and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lod ge , at the Quarterly Communication , and from thence to the annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable Conduct of our Forefathers in every Nation; never taking a legal Course but when the Case cannot be o therwise decided, and patiently listening to the honest and friendly Advice of Master and Fellows when they would prevent your going to Law with strangers, or would excite you to put a speedy Period of all Law - suits, so that you may mind the Affa irs of Masonry with the more Alacrity and Success; but with respect to Brothers or Fellows at Law, the Master and Brethren should kindly offer their Meditation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the contending Brethren; and if that su bmission is impracticable they must, however, carry on their Process, or Law - suit, without Wrath and Rancor (not in the common way), saying or doing nothing which may hinder Brotherly Love, and good Offices to be renew’d and continu’d that all may see the benign Influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the Beginning of the World, and will do to the End of Time.   11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"GENERAL REGULATIONS * Compiled first by Mr. George Payne, Anno 1720, when he was Grand Master and approv’d by the Grand Lodge on St. John Baptist Day, Anno 1721, a t Stantioner’s Hall London; When the most noble Prince John, Duke of Montague, unanimously chosen our Grand Master for the Year ensuing; who chose John Beal, M.D., his Deputy Grand Master ; and Mr. Josiah Villeneau were chosen b y the Mr. Thomas Morris, Jun. Lodge Grand Wardens . And now, by the Command of our said Right Worshipful Grand Master Montague, the Author of this Book has compar’d them with, and reduc’d them to the ancient Records a nd immemorial Usages of the Fraternity, and digested them into this new Method with several proper Explications, for the use of the Lodges in and about London and Westminster . I. The Grand Master or his Deputy hath Authority and Right, not only to be present in any true Lodge, but also to preside wherever he is, with the Master of the Lodge on his Left hand, and to order his Grand Wardens to attend him, who are not to act in particular Lodges as Wardens, but in his Pres ence, and at his Command; because there the Grand Master may command the Wardens of that Lodge, or any other Brethren he pleaseth, to attend and act as his Wardens pro tempore. II. The Master of a particular Lodge has the Right and Authority of congregating the Members of his Lodge into a Chapter at Pleasure, upon any Emergency or Occurrence as well as to appoint the Time and Place of their usual forming; And in case of Sickness, Death, or necessary Absence of the Master, the senior Warden shall act as Master pro tempore, if no Brother is present who has been Master of that Lodge before for in that Case the absent Master’s Authority reverts to the last Master then present though he cannot act until the said senior Warden has once congregated the L odge, or in his absence the junior Warden. III. The Master of each particular Lodge, or one of the Wardens , or some other Brother by his Order, shall keep a Book containing their Bylaws, the Names of their Members, with a list of all the Lodges in Town, and the usual times and places of their forming, and all their Transactions that are proper to be written. IV. No lodge shall make more than Five new Brethren at one Time, nor any Man under the Age of Twenty - five, who must b e also his own Master ; unless by a Dispensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy. V. No Man can be made or admitted a Member of a particular Lodge without previous notice one month before given to the said Lodge in order to ma ke due Enquiry into the Reputation and Capacity of the Candidate; unless by the Dispensation aforesaid. *Or the “Anderson Constitutions;” so called, because written by Br. Jas. Anderson, A.M., the W.M. of the Lodge which was numbered 17 at the time the G rand Lodge was formed. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"VI. But no Man can be enter’d a Brother in any particular Lodge, or admitted to be a member thereof, without the unanimous consent of all the members of that Lodge then present when the Candidate is propos’d, and their Consent is formally ask’d by the Master ; and they are to signify their Consent or Dissent in their own prudent way, either virtually or in form, but with Unanimity; Nor is this inherent Privilege subject to a Dispensation; because the Members of a particular Lodge are the best Judges of it; and if a fractious Member should be impos’d on them, it might spoil their Harmony or hinder their Freedom; or even break and disperse the Lodge, which ought to be avoided by all good and true Brethren. VII. Every new Brother at his mak ing is decently to cloath the Lodge, that is, all the Brethren present, and to deposit something for the relief of indigent and decay’d Brethren, as the Candidates shall think fit to bestow, over and above the small Allowance stated by the bylaws of that p articular Lodge which Charity shall be lodg’d with the Master or Wardens , or the Cashier, if the Members see fit to chuse one. And the Candidates shall also solemnly promise to submit to the Constitutions, the Charges and Regulations, and to such other good Usages as shall be intimated to them in Time and Place convenient VIII. No Set or Number of Brethren shall withdraw or separate themselves from the Lodge in which they were made Brethren, or were afterwards admitted Members, unless the Lodge becomes too numerous; nor even then, without a Dispensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy, and when they are thus separated they must either immediately join themselves to such other Lodge as they shall like best, with the unanimous Consent of that other Lodge to which they go (as above regulated,) or else they must obtain the Grand Master’s Warrant to join in forming a new Lodge. If any Set or Number of Masons shall take upon themselves to form a Lodge without th e Grand Master’s Warrant, the regular Lodges are not to countenance them, or own them as fair Brethren and duly formed, nor approved of their Acts and Deeds; but must treat them as Rebels, until they humble themselves, as the Grand Master , shall, in his prudence, direct and until he approve of them by his Warrant, which must be signifi’d to the other Lodges as the Custom is when a new Lodge is to be registered in the List of Lodges. IX. But if any Brother so far misbeh ave himself as to render his Lodge, uneasy, he shall be twice duly admonish’d by the Master or Wardens in a formed Lodge; and if he will not refrain his Imprudence and obediently submit to the Advice of the Brethren, and reform what gi ves them Offence, he shall be dealt with accordingly to the bylaws of that particular Lodge, or else in such a manner as the Quarterly Communication shall in their great prudence think fit; for which a new Regulation may be afterwards made . X. The Majority of every particular Lodge, when congregated; shall have the Privilege of giving Instructions to their Master and Wardens before the assembling of the Grand Chapter, or Lodge, at the three Quarterly Communications hereafter mention’d, and of the Annual Grand Lodge , too; because their Master and Wardens are their Representatives, and are supposed to speak their Mind. XI. All particular Lodges are to observe the same usages as much as po ssible; in order to which, and for cultivating a good Understanding among Free Masons, some Members out of every Lodge shall be deputed to visit the other Lodges as often as shall be thought convenient. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"XII. The Grand Lodge consists of, and is form’d by, the Masters and Wardens of all the regular particular Lodges upon Record, with the Grand Master at their Head, and his Deputy on his Left hand, and the Grand Wardens in their proper Places; and must have a quarterly Communication about Michaelmas, Christmas, and Lady - Day, in some convenient place, as the Grand Maste r shall appoint, where no Brother shall be present, who is not at that time a Member thereof, without a Dispensation; and while he stays, he shall not be allow’d to vote , nor even give his Opinion without Leave of the Grand Lodge ask’d and given, o r unless it be duly ask’d by the said Lodge. All Matters are to be determin’d in the Grand Lodge by a Majority of Votes, each Member having one Vote, and the Grand Master having two Votes, unless the said Lodge lea ve any articular thing to the Determination of the Grand Master for the sake of Expedition. XIII. At the said Quarterly Communication all Matters that concern the Fraternity in general, or particular Lodges, or single Brethren, are quietl y, sedately and maturely to be discours’d of and transacted. Apprentices must be admitted Masters and Fellow - Craft only here, unless by a Dispensation. Here also all differences that cannot be made up and accommodated privately, nor by a particular Lodge, are to be seriously considered and decided: And if any Brother thinks himself aggrieved by the Decision of this Board, he may appeal to the Annual Grand Lodge next chusing a Grand Master or Wardens . Here also the Master or the Wardens of each particular Lodge shall bring and produce a List of such Members as have been made, or even admitted in their particular Lodges since the last Communication of the Grand Lodge : And there shall be a book kept by the Grand Master , or his Deputy, or rather by some Brother whom the Grand Lodge shall appoint for Secretary , wherein shall be recorded all the Lodges, with their usual Times and Pl aces of forming, and the Names of all the Members of each Lodge; and all the Affairs of the Grand Lodge that are proper to be written. They shall also consider of the most prudent and effectual Methods of collecting and disposing of what Money shall be gi ven to, or lodged with them in Charity, towards the Relief only of any true Brother fallen in Poverty or Decay, but of none else. But every particular Lodge shall dispose of their own Charity for poor Brethren, according to their own Bylaws, until it be ag reed by all the Lodges (in a new Regulation) to carry in the Charity collected by them to the Grand Lodge at the Quarterly or Annual Communication in order to make a common stock of it, for the more handsome Relief of poor Brethren. They sh all also appoint a Treasurer, a Brother of good worldly Substance, who shall be a Member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his Office, and shall be always present, and have Power to move to the Grand Lodge anything, especially what concerns hi s Office. To him shall be committed all Money raised for Charity. or for any other Use of the Grand Lodge, which he shall write down in a Book, with the respective Ends and Uses for which the several Sums are intended; and shall expend or disburse the same by such a certain Order sign’d, as the Grand Lodge shall afterwards agree to in a new Regulation: But he Shall not vote in chusing a Grand Master or Wardens , though in every other Transaction. As in like manner the Secretary shall be a Member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his Office, and vote in everything except in chusing a Grand Master or Wardens. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Treasurer and Secretary shall have each a Clerk, who must be a Brother and Fellow - Craft, but never must be a member of the Grand Lodge , nor speak without being allow’d or desir’d. The Grand Master , or his Deputy shall always command the Treasurer and Secretary , with their Clerks and Books, in order to see how Matters go on, and to know what is expedient to be done upon any emergent Occasion. Another Brother (who must be a Fellow - Craft) should be appointed to look after the Door of the Grand Lodge ; but shall be no member of it. But these Offices may be farther explain’d by a new Regulation, when the Necessity and Expediency of them may more appear than at pre sent to the Fraternity. XIV. If at any Grand Lodge , stated or occasioned, quarterly or annual, the Grand Master and his Deputy should be both absent, then the present Master of a Lodge, that has been the longest a Free Mason, shall take the Chair, and preside as Grand Master pro tempore; and shall be vested with all his power and Honour for the time; provided there is no Brother present that has been Grand Master formerly, or Deputy Grand Master, for the la st Grand Master Present, or else the last Deputy present, should always of right take place in the Absence of the present Grand Master and his Deputy. XV. In the Grand Lodge none can act as Warden but the Grand Wardens themselves , if present; and if absent, the Grand Master , or the Person who presides in his Place, shall order private Wardens to act as Grand Wardens pro tempore, whose Places are to be suppli’d by two Fellow - Craft of the same Lodge, call’d forth to act, or sent thither by the particular Master thereof; or if by him omitted, then they shall be call’d by the Grand Master, that so the Grand Lodge may be always complete. XVI. The Grand Wardens , or any others, are first to advise wit h the Deputy about the Affairs of the Lodge or of the Brethren, and not to apply to the Grand Master without the knowledge of the Deputy, unless he refuse his Concurrence in any certain necessary Affair; in which Case, or in case of any Difference between the Deputy and the Grand Wardens, or other Brethren, both parties are to go by Concert to the Grand Master who can easily decide the Controversy and make up the Difference by virtue of his great Authority. The Grand Master should receive no Intimation of Business concerning Masonry , but from his Deputy first, except in such certain Cases as his Worship can well judge of, for if the Application to the Grand Master be irregular, he can easily ord er the Grand Wardens or any other Brethren thus applying, to wait upon his Deputy, who is to prepare the Business speedily, and to lay it orderly before his Worship. XVII. No Grand Master , Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wa rdens , Treasurer, Secretary or whoever acts for them, or in their stead pro tempore, can at the same time be the Master or Warden of a particular Lodge; but as soon as any of them has honorably discharg’d his Grand Office, he return s to that post or station in his particular Lodge, from which he was call’d to officiate above. XVIII. If the Deputy Grand Master be sick or necessarily absent, the Grand Master may chuse any Fellow - Craft he pleases to be his Dep uty pro tempore: But he that is chosen Deputy at the Grand Lodge , and the Grand Wardens too, cannot be discharged without the Cause fairly appear to the Majority of the Grand Lodge; and the Grand Master, if he is uneasy, may call a Grand Lodge on purpose to lay the Cause 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"before them, and to have their Advice and Conference: In which case the Majority of the Grand Lodge, if they cannot reconcile the Master and his Deputy or his Wardens, are to concur in allowing the Master to discharge his said Deputy or his said Wardens, and to chuse another Deputy immediately and the said Grand Lodge shall chuse other Wardens in that Case, that Harmony and Peace may be preserved. XIV. If the Grand Master should a buse his Power, and render himself unworthy of the Obedience and Subjection of the Lodges, he shall be treated in a way and manner to be agreed upon in a new Regulation because hitherto the ancient Fraternity have had no occasion for it, their former Grand Masters having all behaved themselves worthy of that honorable Office. XX. The Grand Master , with his Deputy and Wardens , shall (at least once) go round and visit all the Lodges about Town during his Mastership. XXI. If the Grand Master die during his Mastership, or by Sickness, or by being beyond Sea, or any other way should be render’d uncapable of discharging his Office, the Deputy, or in his Absence, the Senior Grand Warden , or in his Absence the Junior, or in his Absence any three present Masters of Lodges, shall join to congregate the Grand Lodge immediately, to advise together upon that Emergency, and to send two of their Number to invite the last G rand Master to resume his Office, which now in course reverts to him; or if he refuse, then the next last, and so backward: But if no former Grand Master can be found, then the Deputy shall act as Principal, until another is chosen; or if there be no Deput y, then the oldest Master. XXII. The Brethren of all the Lodges in and about London and Westminster, shall meet at an Annual Communication and Feast, in some convenient place, on St. John Baptist’s Day, or else on St. John Evangelist’s Day, as the Grand Lodge shall think fit by a new Regulation, having of late Years met on St. John Baptist’s Day: Provided, The Majority of the Masters and Wardens , with the Grand Maste r , his Deputy and Wardens, agree at their Quarterly Communication, three months before, and there shall be a Feast, and a General Communication of all the Brethren: For if either the Grand Master, or the Majority of the particular Masters, are against it, it must be dropt for that Time. But whether there shall be a Feast for all the Brethren, or not, yet the Grand Lodge must meet in some convenient Place annually on St. John’s Day : or if it be Sund ay, then the next Day, in order to chuse every Year a new Grand Master , Deputy and Wardens . XXIII.

But that the Work may not be too burthensome to the two Grand Ward ens and that all Matters may be expeditiously and safely managed, The Grand Master or his Deputy shall have power to nominate and appoint a certain Number of Stewards, as his Worship shall think fit, to act in concert with the two Grand Wardens; a ll things relating to the Feast being decided among them by a Majority of Voices except the Grand Master or his Deputy interpose by a particular Direction or Appointment. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"XXIV.

If the Grand Master pleases, he may in due time summon all the Ma sters and Wardens of Lodges to consult with them about ordering the Grand Feast, and about any Emergency or accidental thing relating thereunto, that may require Advice; or else to take it upon himself altogether. XXV. Th e Master of Lodges shall each appoint one experienc’d and discreet Fellow - Craft of his Lodge, to compose a Committee, consisting of one from every Lodge, who shall meet to receive, in a convenient Apartment, every Person that brings a Ticket, and shall have Power to discourse him, if they think fit, in order to admit him or debar him, as they shall see cause: Provided they send no Man away before they have acquainted all the Brethren within Doors with the Reasons thereof, to avoid Mistakes, that n o true Brother may be debarr’d nor a false Brother, or mere Pretender, admitted.

And his Worship declaring his consent by a Bow or a Speech, as he pleases, the said deputed Member of the Grand Lodge shall proclaim his Grand Master, and all the Members of the Lodge shall salute him in due Form. And all the Brethren shall for a few Minutes have leave to declare their Satisfaction, Pleasure and Congratulation. XXIII. But if either the Masters and Wardens have not in private, this Day before Dinner, nor the Day before, desir’d the last Grand Master to continue in the Mastership another Year, or if he, when desir’d has not consented: Then, The last Grand Master shall nominate his Successor for the year ensuing, who if unanimously ap prov’d by the Grand Lodge , and if there present, shall be proclaim’d, saluted, and congratulated the new Grand Master as above hinted, and immediately install’d by the last Grand Master, according to Usuage.

There has been some diversity of opinion among Masonic writers as to the nature of Landmarks, but to quote Mackey again, “The safest method is to restrict th em to those ancient, and therefore universal, customs , which, either grew gradually into rules of action or if enacted by authority were, enacted so long ago that no record account of their origin is found in Masonic histo ry.” and the Landmarks are therefore of higher antiquity than memory or history can reach. The first requisite to constitute a Landmark is its antiquity. Another peculiarity of Landmarks is that they are unrepealable — cannot be changed by any existing authority , being older than such authority. To change them would be to destroy the foundations of Masonry itself. The Landmarks of Masonry , computed by Mackey, are twenty - five briefly stated as follows: 1 st . T he Modes of Recognition. 2 nd . The Division of Symbolic Masonry into three degrees . 3 rd . The Legend of the Third Degree. 4 th . The Government of the Fraternity by a Grand Master . 5 th . The Prerogative of the Grand Master to Preside over every assembly of the Craft. 6 th . The Prerogative of the Grand Master to Grant Dispensations for conferring degrees at irregular times. 7 th . The Prerogative of t he Grand Master to give dispensations for opening and holding Lodges. 8 th . The Prerogative of the Grand Master to make Masons at Sight. 9 th . The necessity for Masons to congregate in Lo dges. 10 th . The Government of the Craft when congregated in a Lodge, by a Master and two Wardens . 11 th . The necessity that every Lodge when congregated, should be duly Tyled. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"12 th . The right of every Mason to be represented in the general meetings of the Craft, and to instruct its Representative. 13 th . The right of every Mason to appeal from the decision of his brethren in Lodge convened to the Grand Lodge or General Assembly of Masons. 14 th . The right of every Mason to visit and sit in every Regular Lodge.* 15 th . That no visitor unknown to the brethren present, or to some of them, as a Mason, can enter a Lodge without passing an examination . 16 th . That no Lodge can interfere in the business of another Lodge. 17 th . That every Freemason is amendable to the Laws and Regulations of the Masonic Jurisdiction in which he resides. 18 th . That certain Qualifications of candidates for Initiation shall be that he is a man, unmutilated, freeborn, and of mature age . 19 th . A belief in the existence of God as the Grand Architect of the Universe. 20 th . The Belief in the Resurrection to a Future Life. 21 st . That a “Book of the Law” shall constitute an indispensable part of the Furniture of every Lodge. 22 nd . The Equality of all Masons. 23 rd . The Secrecy of the Institution. 24 th . The Foundation of a Speculative Science upon an Operative Art, and the Symbolic Use and Explanation of the Terms of the Art, for purposes of Religious or Moral Teaching. 25 th .

(Best, 1896) Affiliation . The ordinary residence and jurisdiction requirements do not obtain in the case of a petitioner for affiliation . (Gifford, 1883; Schrader, 1885) Pe tition of former member takes same procedure as that of any other application for affiliation (Best, 1896) A secret objection to petition for affiliation cannot be interposed. (Merrifield , 1929) Assessment. The failure to pay an assessment legally voted subjects a member to suspension the same as non - payment of dues . (Blatt, 1887) Ballot. The Master and Wardens alone have the righ t to inspect the ballot , and when declared, the Worshipful Master should destroy the same. (James, 1901) Ballot — Illegal Unless Black Cubes in Box . Unless there are black cubes in the ballot box when a ballo t is taken, the ballot is illegal and void. (Haig, 1921) Ballot begins with reading of report of investigating committee and ends with announcement by Master of result. (Forkner, 1935) Bond. A Lodge may require a bond of either the Secretary or the Treasurer. (Cloes, 1890) Business at Special Communication . Conferring of degrees , conducting trials, performing Masonic funeral service, and such business as may be specifically mentioned in call for such special communication , can properly be transacted at the same. All members within the jurisdiction of the Lodge must be notified of such special communication. (Schra der, 1885; Best, 1896) Bylaws - Signing.

(McDonald, 1894) 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Candidate neglecting to apply for initiation or advancement within one year must be balloted upon again. In case the fault as above is on the part of the Lodge, a new ballot is not necessary. (Perkin1897; James, 1900) A knowledge of preceding degrees is necessary for advancement . (Gifford, 1884) The examination of a candidate for advancement must be in open Lodge. (Thompson, 1891) An elected candidate may be initiated at the communication at which he is elected. (Schroeder, 1885) A Lodge holds perpetual jurisdiction ove r an elected candidate so long as he resides in this Grand Jurisdiction ; however, the electing Lodge may waive jurisdiction and may return the fee . (Herrick, 1893) The symbolic degrees , except the second section of the Master Mason Degree, may be conferred upon more than one candidate at the same time. (Braden, 1889) A candidate , having been irregularly elected , initiated or passed through inadvertence as to jurisdiction lines, is not entitled to advancement in the Lodge within whose jurisdiction he resides without first petitioning for such advancement and receiving an e lection for the same. (Keyes, 1899) Candidate’s Qualifications Explained . Candidates for Masonic light should possess qualifications of three kinds: Mental, moral and physical . First, mental , in that the candidate shall be literate , with sufficient education to understand the ceremonies and principles of Masonry . (Gifford, 1884) Second, moral , in that the candidate should be a man who respects the moral law and obeys the laws of the state and nation. (Foley, 1905; Jacobson, 1906; James, 1901) Third, physical , the theory of perfect youth belonged to the age when Masonry was operative and not speculative. It is the mental and moral qualities , not physical, that determine whether a man is a suitable candidate for Masonic light, hence the Grand Lodge of North Dakota does not hold to the rule of physical perfection (bylaws, Chap. V, Sec. 14 ( y )) Charges . It is the duty of a Master Mason to prefer charges , or cause the same to be done by the Junior Warden, against any brother whom he knows to be guilty of un - Masonic cond uct . (Keyes, 1899) Charity. The funeral expenses of a deceased brother need not be assumed by a Lodge except when there is absolute need of charity . (Blacklock, 1904) Charity bestowed voluntarily upon a bro ther not a member of the contributing Lodge, is not a legal claim against the recipient’s Lodge. When aid is given at the request, or with direct consent of another Lodge, it constitutes a legal claim against said Lodge. (Blatt, 1887) 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Decision, Effect of . Decisions of the Grand Master during recess of the Grand Lodge have the effect of law, unless modified or revoked by himself or the Grand Lodge. (Gifford, 1882) Degree on Which Lodge Be Op ened . A lodge must never be opened on a degree lower than that in which the work is to be done. Should the Lodge be opened on the Master Mason degree, the other symbolic degrees are technica lly opened, and work may be done by calling from one degree to the other. (Best, 1896) Degrees by Courtesy. Compliance to such requests between Lodges in this grand jurisdiction is expected unless good grounds for refusal exist. A majority vote , vive voice, is all that is necessary to warrant such action unless charges are preferred. (Carothers, 1898) Demits. The Worshipful Master and Wardens of a constituent Lodge c annot demit (Thompson, 1891). (Committee on Jurisprudence, 1896) A demit issued to an E. A. or F. C. in another grand jurisdiction should be accepted by lodges here. Petition for advancement takes regula r course. (Stockwell, 1903) A diploma does not answer the same purpose as a demit . (Schrader, 1885; Herrick, 1893) A demit cannot be refused because a brother is owing his lodge for other than dues and as sessments. If his dues and assessments are paid and there are no charges pending, he is “clear on the books.” (Elton, 1926) Dues . Filing of charges for non - payment of dues must not be repeatedly delayed. Reasonable time should be given delinquents , after which the regular procedure shall obtain. (Carothers, 1898) During the time of suspension , dues are not chargeable and cannot be collected against a suspended brother. (Carot hers, Acting G.M., 1897) Irregular suspension for non - payment of dues is not valid. (James, 1901) A lodge may remit part or all arrearages of a brother suspended N.P.D. applying for restoration. (Merrifield, 1929) Elec tion. Election of Officers must be by majority vote . A mere plurality is not sufficient. (Bitzing, 1934) 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Expulsion . An expelled Mason may be re - instated upon petition , which petition must take the course as any petition. If elected a re - obligation alone is necessary. (See bylaws, Chapte r VI, Sec. 3(k) (Blacklock, 1904) A Lodge loses jurisdiction over an expelled Mason when he moves without its jurisdiction. (Blacklock, 1904) An expelled Mason remains under the jurisdiction of the Lodge from which h e was expelled so long as he remains a resident of this grand jurisdiction. (Committee Revision, 1916). If expelled after 1927 refer to Chapter VI, Sec. 3(k) of bylaws. Fees . The full amount of fees set by Lodge bylaws must be collected. No remission is permissible. (Robinson, 1933) Funds in Defunct Bank . If funds are deposited in a bank in the name of the Lodge as provided by Grand Lodge bylaws, the Treasurer of the lodge c annot be held personally responsible if the bank fails. (Haig, 1921) Funerals. Every Master Mason in good standing is entitled to Masonic burial . A non - affiliate of known good character may receive Masonic burial by vote of the Lodge and the approval of the Worshipful Master. (Blatt, 1887) Entered Apprentices or Fellow Crafts cannot be given Masonic burial . (Forkner, 1935) The funeral expenses of a deceased Master Mason are not a legal claim against his Lodge unless authorized. However, when such courtesy is extended in the belief that the same was authorized, it is a legal claim and must be paid by the Lodge to which the deceased belonged. (Blacklock, 1904) The flag of our country, supported by a guard, may precede the lodge in marching. If a lodge participates in the burial of a de ceased brother, it must be in complete charge and control of same, but it may consent to another organization participating in the funeral , subject to our regulations and at such time and place as the Master d irects. After the Masonic ceremony is commenced, however, nothing can interrupt or follow. The lodge service, including the committal to the grave, shall be the final rite. The single exception to this rule is that by Grand Lodge resolution in case of funerals of ex - servicemen, permission has been granted for the sounding of taps and a volley by a firing squad following the Masonic service. (Murfin, 1928) Funeral, Participation by American Legion . The American Legion may be permitted by the Master to participate in a Masonic funeral to the extent of firing a volley and sounding taps after the Masonic committal services.

No dispensation is necessary for lodge to change its place of meeting p rovided the hall is located in the same municipality. (Braden, 1889; Thompson, 1891) Hall, Renting of . A Masonic hall may be rented to another organization. (Cloes, 1890) Jurisdiction . Residence in this grand jurisdiction is not essential to affiliation . (Stockwell, 1903) Jurisdiction is never lost by a Lodge over an Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft even though he moves out of its jurisdiction . (Bla cklock, 1904) (Modified by an approved decision authorizing the issuance of a special demit to an Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft moving permanently outside this jurisdiction .) Invasion of jurisdiction carries with it the relinquishment of candidate , as well as the payment of fees collected, to invaded Lodge. (Keyes, 1899) Waiver of jurisdiction lies solely within the province of the lodg e holding jurisdiction. (Blatt, 1887) Residence in the jurisdiction of one Lodge is lost by removal therefrom and not gained with another Lodge under six months. (Perkins, 1897) An elected candidate removing permanently to another grand jurisdiction and remaining there longer than one year, without receiving any degrees , loses his Masonic residence in the original instance. The electing lodge has also lost jurisdiction. A North Dakota Lodge has no jurisdiction outside the state. (Keyes, 1899) (See Chapter V, Section 2. 4) Concurrent Jurisdiction with Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Saskatchewan.) A Lodge which has confe rred the Entered Apprentice , or the Entered Apprentice and Fellow Craft Degrees upon a candidate , does not lose jurisdiction . (Carothers, 1898) (Except as modified by the approved de cision permitting the issuance of a special demit to an E.A. or F.C.) When Master Mason Degree is conferred by request, the usual Investigating Committee is not necessary. (Carothers, 1898) Jurisdiction, Waiver of. An application for a Waiver of Jurisdiction over rejected material lies over until the first stated Communications in succeeding month. Application can be granted only upon a unanimous, secret ballot . (Blatt, 1886; Cloes, 1890; Perkins, 1897) 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Jurisdiction, Waiver of. Rejection of Candidate . When a lodge waives jurisdiction in favor of another lodge, it has no further claim upon the candidate in question. If the candidate is rejected by the lodge in whose favor jurisdiction is waived, he is still the material of the rejecting lodge so long as he continues to reside within the jurisdiction of the lodge which originally had jurisdictio n over him. (Haig. 1921) Life Membership . A lodge cannot grant Life Membership except to Masons who have been members of the order thirty years as provided in the Grand Lodge bylaws. It is illegal to grant life memberships upon the payment of a definite sum in advance in lieu of dues . (Elton, 1926). (Modified by Chap. V, Section 14(W) of bylaws.) Liquor . No portion of a building owned or controlled by a lodge c an be rented or used for the sale of beer or liquor. (Forkner, l935) The portion of a building that is not owned, controlled, or used for tiled meetings by a constituent Lodge , or the Grand Lodge , is not s ubject to the restrictions of paragraph (6), Section 1, Chapter VI of the bylaws of the Grand Lodge of North Dakota. (Skogley, 1980) Lotteries and Gambling . Engagement in lotteries or other games of chance by lodges , or by individuals in Masonic Temples is forbidden . (Merrifield, 1929; Thompson, 1936; Pollock, 1938) Misrepresentation in Petition . A false statement in a petition subjects the petitioner to discipline. (Blacklock, 1904) Offenses, Masonic . All offenses against the criminal statutes of the state when committed by a Mason are Masonic offenses . It does not follow, however, that all Masonic offenses are criminal. (Carothers, 1898) It is not a Masonic offense for a Brother to petition the wrong Lodge through inadvertence. (Keyes, 1899) Officers of the Lodge . When the Master and both Wardens are absent, Lodge cannot be regula rly opened. No business can be transacted, hence no minutes are made. (Schrader, 1885) In the absence of the Worshipful Master and Senior Warden , the Junior Warden is the legal presiding officer. An acting Senior Warden has no rights of succession. (Foulks, 1902) The Master of a Lodge assumes the duties of his office upon installation . (Braden, 1889) The general rule of eligibility for a Wor shipful Master is that he must have been installed and served as a Warden in a constituent Lodge previous to his election and installation as Master. 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Exceptions: In a new Lodge, the Grand Master may appoint any well - qualified Brother. In an emergency in a constituent Lodge , this general rule may be waived by dispensation from th e Grand Master, but consent of those eligible who are residents of town wherein Lodge is located must be secured.

Such action is by affirmative vote of the Lodge and with the approval of the Grand Master . (Foley, modified, 1905) Only Master Masons may act as Master, Wardens or Tyler . (Forkner, 1935) An elective officer can refuse to serve. (Cloes, 1890) The Worshipful Master and Senior Warden of a Lodge cannot demit during the term of their office . (Best, 1896). (Modified, 1916) Status of Senior Warden . The permanent removal of the Worshipful Master from the jurisdiction of his lodge makes the Senior Warden the Acting Master until such time as the Office of Worshipful Master shall have been declared vacant and a new Worshipful Master elected . as Acting Master, he must assume all the r ights and duties of the office . He cannot avoid responsibility; however, he may invite any Brother to preside temporarily and confer degrees , but the Brother so invited acquires no right or powers beyond those of the moment. The status of the Junior Warden is not affected when the Senior Warden becomes Acting Master. (Jacobson, 1906, as modified by bylaws, 1916; Best, 1896) Officers, Appointive; May be Removed . The Worshipful Master may declare vacant an appointive office and appoint and install an appointive officer. (Lenhart, 1920) Petitions. It is the duty of a Worshipful Master to arrest a petition for degrees and stop furt her proceedings in case the petitioner does not comply with the qualifications as to residence .

(REV.2002)    76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Freemasonry And Religion a ) Basic Principles. Freemasonry is not a religion, nor is it a substitute for religion. It requires of its members belief in a God as part of the obligation of every responsible adult, but advocated no sectarian faith or pract ice. Mason ceremonies include prayers, both traditional and extempore, to reaffirm each individual’s dependence on God and to seek divine guidance. Freemasonry is open to men of any faith, but religion may not be discussed at Masonic meetings. b ) The Sup reme Being. Masons believe that there is one God and that people employ many different ways to seek, and to express what they know of, God. Masonry primarily uses the appellation, “Grand Architect of the Universe,” and other non - sectarian titles, to addre ss Deity. In this way, persons of different faiths may join together in prayer, concentrating on God, rather than differences among themselves. Masonry believes in religious freedom and that the relationship between the individual and God is personal, priv ate, and sacred. c ) Volume of the Sacred Law. An open volume of the Sacred Law, “the rule and guide of life,” is an essential part of every Masonic meeting. The Volume of the Sacred Law to a Judeo - Christian is the Bible; to Freemasons of other faiths, it is the book held holy by them. d ) The Oath of Freemasonry. The obligations taken by Freemasons are sworn on the Volume of the Sacred Law. They are undertakings to follow principles of Freemasonry and to keep confidential a Freemason’s means of recogniti on. The much - discussed “penalties,” judicial remnants from an earlier era are symbolic, not literal. They refer only to the pain any honest man should feel at the thought of violating his word. e ) Freemasonry Compared with Religion. Freemasonry lacks th e basic elements of religion. 1 ) It has no dogma or theology, no wish or means to enforce religious orthodoxy. 2 ) It offers no sacraments. 3 ) It does not claim to lead to salvation by works, by secret knowledge, or by any other means. The secrets of Freemasonry are concerned with modes of recognition, not with the means of salvation. (REV.1999) Freemasonry Supports Religion . Freemasonry is far from indifferent toward religion. Without interfering in religious practice, it expects each member to follow his own faith and to place his Duty to God above all other duties. Its moral teaching are acceptable to all religions.
