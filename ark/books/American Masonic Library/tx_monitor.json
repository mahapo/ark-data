To those actively engaged in the dissemination of our ritualistic work, it has been for some time apparent that the main body of our Monitor needed revision and a slight rearrangement, in order that some typogiaphical and grammatical errors might be eliminated, and the language, in certain places, maae to harmonize more closely with our excellent, and now uniformly disseminated, esoteric ritual. When we take into consideration the fact that it has been nearly a half century since Bro. Taylor compiled the splendid Monitor which, since then, has borne his hon9red name, the great wonder is that he was able, at that early period n our Grand Lodge history, to an~ange a Monitor so admirably adapted to meet the wants of Masonry in Texas for so long a time, and that even now, after being in use br forty-nine years, so few corrections are found to be necessary. The beautiful and inimitable language found in all Monitors was formulated and systematically ar - ranged tn 1772, by Preston, fxom the ancient oral teachings of Masonry, and, in 1797, die same was adapted, by Webb, to the American Rite. In 1819 Cross added to this the feature of illustrated em - blems. Since their day, this ~restonian language, and those Lilustratlons, have comprised the main 2 I I ‘I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 (F PREFACE body of all Monitors, and ‘have become so hallowed by age and cositinued usage, that any change, other than that of adaptation, would %ry justly be looked upon as an innovation, and “deviation from our established customs.” The monitorial. text and the illustrations, as well as most of the forms~ ceremonies, regulations and other explanatory matte~ usually included in Mon - itors, being “set’ language, and very little original composition being iequired in the Monitor itself, it would have b~en entirely proper, had stich been my desire, to have brought this out as an independent Momtor. Suchr however, is my high regaid for the mempry of our deceased Past Grand Master that it is my preference to bring it out as a “revision” of Taylor’s Monitor, so that his name may continue to be handed down as a household word among the Craft in Texas, and his memory thus perpetuated in our ritualism, that department of Masonry in which he rendered his most devoted and efficient service. We have every reason to believe that our ancient brethren looked upon Masonry as the very embodi - ment of truth and virtue, and that they had every confidence in the verity of its sacred legends and traditions. Would that all Masons so considered them today! But we find that-the baneful influence of so-called “higher-criticism” has, in these latter days, led niany learned and accomplished Craftsmen into the meshes of iconoclasfic thought, and the vain attempt has been made to rob Masonry of its heaven-born attnbutes, and to reduce it to the level PREFACE q of a finite, human institution, and all this has been done regardless of the many internal and e aternal evidences of its mysterious correlation with that which is obviously infinite, and therefore beyond the comprehension of the finite mind. With a desiie to counteract, to some extent at least, this insidious form of skepticism now endan - gering our young and inexperienced Craftsmen, and even some older ones, it has been deemed expedient to incorporate, in this edition, some introductory remarks (for which the writer alone is responsible), relative to the origin and dual nature of Masonry. If a zealous attachment to Masonry in Texas for more than thirty-five years (the last twenty de - voted particularly to the study of our esoteric and monitorial ritual, and generally to Masonry upon all lines), shall have enabled me to revise our pres - ent excellent Monitor, so as to make it more accept - able and useful to the Craft, my highest aim and most ardent desue will have been attained, and the approval of my brethren, and the satisfaction of having, in this humble way, done something to forward the best interests of Masonry, will amply compensate me for the service rendered Grateful acknowledgment is hereby tendered to R W.

If A TRADITIONAL SUMMARY. From the commencement of the world we ~ trace the foundation of Masonry. Ever since sym - metry began, and harmony displayed her charms, our Order has had a being. During many ages, and in many different countries, it has flourished. ¶ No art, no science, preceded it. In the dark periods of antiquity, when literature was in a low state, and the rude manners of our forefathers withheld from them that knowledge we now so amply share, Masonry diffused its influence. This sci.nce unvailed, arts arose, civilization took place, and the progress of kno~sledge and philosophy gradually dispelled the gloom of ignorance and barbarism. Govemment being settled, authority was given to laws, and the assemblies of the Fratem - ity acquired the patronage of the great and the good, while the tenets of the profession diffused un - bounded philanthropy—Preston (1772). ii ___________ 1’ - ~~-~~---.,—= <I"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"3hitrnburtinti. For the especial benefit of our younger brethren, and for the good of the Craft in general, it has been deemed expedient to incorporate, in this revised edition of the Monitor, a few deductions, based en’ tirely upon the testimony of Masonry in reference to itself. While Masonry must, in the very nature of things, evet remain, to our finite riiinds, a deep, abstruse and incomprehensible mystery, yet, when viewed in the light of THE SACRED SCRIPTURES, and of the revelations preserved and handed down to us in the sacred legends and traditions of Maionry, we can learn much in regard to our ancient and .1 honorable Order, calculated to refine our social and -I mosal nature, and thereby make us better Masons. Its mysterious antiqueness, the wisdom couched in its symbolic mode of instruction—its unexampled survival, and its strange, mysterious, supernatural influence over our inner nature, all bespeak for 5 Masonry an origin higher than human, and a sphere of influence not limited to earth. For many centuries, learned men have vainly en - deavored, by taxing the utmost resources of human wisdom, to solve its mysterious nature, to establish 13"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"#1 14 INTRODUCTION its metes and bounds, and to locate, with some degree of certainty, the date of its origin. Thousands of volumes have been written and published, numerous theories have been advanced and ably championed by men of great intellectual ability and literary attainments, and yet, no satis - factory conclusions have been reached. This conclusively demonstrates the fact that ANCIENT CRAFT MASONRY remains, and ever will remain, a ~p, unfathomable mystery, unless, by faith, we accept as true the hght of Divine revelations and Masonic tradition. As Masons, we are in search of Truth, and as Masons, we are taught the necessity of more light than hun-ian science can afford us Then let us see what light Masonry will shed upon itself. What does it testify in regard to THE ORIGIN OF MASONRY? It declares, in plain and unmistal<eable terms, that it is of “a Divine nature.” This, as we can readily see, is equivalent to an assertion of Divine ong in, for had man originated Masonry, it is clearly evident that he could not have imparted to it a Divine nature. We are, therefore, inevitably driven to the conclusion that Masonry is not of human, but is of DIVINE ORIGIN, and this will become more and more apparent as we advance. Relative to its scope and extent, it proclaims, in a plain and emphatic manner, that such is infinite! 13 INTRODUC’I ION The possession of this attribute, as we can see, at once lifts Masonry above the plane of a simple, finite, earthly 9rganization, and proclaims its spirit - uality, and this further substantiates its Divine origin. Thus, at the very threshold of our investigations upon this line, we have uncovered two fundamental truths, we have discovered that Masonry is not only of Divine origin, but that IT IS INFINITE AND SPIRITUAL, and upon this solid base, we can plant our feet, and with much assunince of success, proceed to further investigate the subject. We can now see why it is that our visible, finite form of Masonry is symbolic and representative, for it could not be that, and at the same time, be the original. It thus becomes clear to our minds that the real entity of Masonry is spiritual, and that our finite form of it is but a representation of the original Then the question naturally arises, “When and how did we come into possession of that upon which our representative Masonry is predicated?” Masonry again comes t~o our relief and informs us that it is founded upon DIVINE REVELATIONS, and these, as we learn in the Sacred Scriptures, were made to mankind, in the earliest ages of the world. Thus was Masonry revealed to man, and at -once reduced to practice, and this was the beginning of ‘F"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"16 INTRODUCTION our Order on earth, the origin of,, ir finite form of Masonry. • In proof of the correctness of this assertion, let the “ANCIENT CHARGES OF A FREEMASON” testify, for, in the last clause of this ancient and universally accepted document, we read. “That all may see the benign influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the beginning of the world, and will do to the end of time. Amen So mote it belt Our fathers believed this, why should not we? If this be true, and it certainly is, then why is it that such a vast amount of time and learning, so much scientific and antiquarian research, has been lavishly expended in the vain attempt to disprove the truthfulness of our ancient traditions, by en - deavoring to attribute its ongin to ,the Egyptian Mysteries, or to the time of the building of KING SOLOMON’S TENPLE, or numerous othet dates? How can we account for this, when Masonry solemnly and most emphatically affirms that it has been actually existing among men, and has been practiced by them, from the very dawn of Creation? It certainly is high time that we were returning to the fa[th of our Masonic ancestry, and thus shake off the vagaries of MODERN SKEPTICISM. To the true and devoted Craftsman, Freemaspnry must ever be esteemed to be the very personifica - r INTRODUCTION 17 tion and embodiment of Truth and Virtue—for, the very moment a Mason gets his consent to question the truth of its ~declarations, that very moment his faith in it is shaken, and his appreciation of. itis lessened. We have every reason to believe that our ANCIENT BRETHREN • reposed implicit confidence in the eternal verity of Masonry, and that in it they traced the handiwork of Deity. Halcyon days, indeed, must those have been, when our brethren of the Mystic Tie, with happy hearts and buoyant tread, marched along life’s pathway, following the lead of Faith, as it held aloft the light of Divine revelations, singing as they trod life’s otherwise weary pilgrimage, paeans of praise to their SUPREME GRAND MASTER, for the gift of such a beneficent boon as Freemasonry. They saw in our human form of Masonry, the re - flected image of the infinite This brings me, naturally and logically, up to the presentation of a theory which has been reached by reasoning by analogy, and, for the lack of a better term, we will call it the DUALITY OF FREEMASONRY, and by this is meant that strange, mysterious in - carnation, in the body of our visible, organized Masonry, of the spint of Masonry. Although this is incomprehensible to us, so is a 2 11"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"is ISTRODUCTIOB 19 INTRODUCTION similar blending of the spirit of man, in the body of man, also incomprehensible by our finite minds, and yet it is an accepted fact. If we accept it in thh human being, why not accept it in regard to Masonry? - If man’s nature is part human, and part spiritual, and if Masonry was designed by the GREAT CREATOR to minister to man’s necessities, how could Masonry fulfill its mission,, unless it, too, was spiritual, as well as natural? This theory, therefore, is in harmony with the Divine revelations, Masonic tra - ditions and is not contrary to human reason. This theory of thc duality of Masonry is also in harmony with the accepted duality of man. Although, when viewed in the abstract, it is a very abstruse and metaphysical subject, yet when we use the duality of man’s nature, by way of il - lustration, we avoid all such difficulties, and it is made quite plain. We know, from observation and experience, that when the spirit of Masonry is fully reflected in the life of a Mason, or in any Masonic Lodge, or other body of Masonry, that it everts a great power for good in the world, and we also know, that when that spirit is wanting, Masonic life and influence ceases, just as human life and influence ceases just as soon as the spirit leaves the body of man. We learn, in Masonry, “that it is the ‘internal,’ and not the ‘external,’ that Masonry regaids.’ Masonry is here, in its own quaint, ancient way, calling oui attention to the supernatural excellence of the real, essential, spiritual part. of Masonry, that must havc its abode within us, for, unless it does, and unless we are vitalized by the ‘indwelling spirit of Masonry, our profession of it is vain, and it will, so far as we are concomed, cease to exert its salutary influence in the world The spirit of man is the life of man, and the SPIRIT OF MASONRY, is the life of Masonry It is by means of this ana - logous duality that we can rationally account for that strange infatuation which has prompted most Masons, and even Masons of the profoundest erudi - tion, to mistake our visible form of Masonry for its real entity We learn, under the head of “Astronomy,” in the Fellow Craft’s degree, that it sometimes becomes necessary to ‘‘correct the fallacy of the senses by the light of truth In this instance of mistaking the external, visible form of Masonry, for the real, internal and invisible spirit of Masonry, we have a striking example of “the fallacy of the senses.’’~ As the same mistake is made by us all, in regard to our fellow-beings ddring life, we can see how easy it is for the same mistake, the same “fallacy of the senses,” to occur in regard to FREEMASONRY, that so naturally occCirs to each of us with reference to each other. During his lifetime, we mistake the visible form of"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"I —j INTRODUCTION our friend for his ieal entity, and this “fallacy of - the senses” is not dispelled, until death calls hence the real personage, and then “the light of truth” dispels the fallacy, and we become aware of our mis - take It is in like manner that we are prone to mistake the flnite~ form, the representative medium through which the real entity of Masonry manifests itself to us, for the real, spiritual entity of Free - masonry - Now, my Brethren, let us realize that God is the author of our great and glorious institution, that its divine truths were revealed by Him to the earliest representatives of our race—that these God- given principles have been espoused and practiced in every age of the woild, and that Masonry is in - finite, eternal and spiritual, and that, to be Masons in deed, and in truth, the spirit of Masonry must dwell within us, and dominate our lives Let us remember, that it has numbered among its devotees, many of the greatest and best men in every age and country—yet Masonry did not need the prestige of their names to add to the lustre of its glory—but in order for them to achieve true greatness they needed the VITALIZING, REFINING INPLUENCE of Freemasonry, and thus equipped, together with their great intellectual endowments, and a heroism that challenged admiration, they went forth to champion the right and to bless humanity. Neatly twenty centuries ago Gamaliel, a learned doctor of the Jewish law, gave expression to this INTRODUCTION 21 truth, “if this counsel or this work be of men, ‘it will come to naught; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it.’ The survival’ of Masonry th oughout the ages, when all else has passed away, is one of the strongest collateral evidences that we have of its Divine origin and supernatural excellence. Let us, then, study it in the light of its own God- given revelations, practice its principles and worship the God of Masonry at its altars as long as we live Then. when the mallet of Death shall call us hence, may each one of us, by faith in the merits of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, be welcomed to a blessed immortality, and, in the glorious morn of the Res - urrection, may our bodies rise and become as in - corruptible as our souls.

Smelling Is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. [Animal and vegetable bodies, and indeed most other bodies, while exposed to air, continually send forth effluvia of vast subtlety, as well in the state of life and growth as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction These effluvia, being drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all bodies are smelled Hence it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator’s having l)lanted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal, through which the air continually passes in respiration Tasting Enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food [The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smell guards the entrance of the canal for respira - tion.

This science is truly congenial to the nature of man, for, by its powerful ch~rms, the most discordant pas - sions may be harmonized and brought into perfect - unison, but it never sounds with such seraphic harmony as when employed in singing hymns of gratitude to the Creator of the Ijniverse.3 Astronomy [s that sublime science which inspires the contem - plative mind to soar aloft and read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the great Creator in the heavens. [How nobly eloquent of the Deity is the celestial hemisp here t — spangled with the most mag - nificent heralds of his infinite glory! They speaJ’ to the whole universe; for there is neither speech so barbarous but their language is understood, nor nations so distant but their voices are heard among them. ‘The heavens proclaim the glory of God; The firmament declareth the worki of Ins hands” Assisted by Astronomy, we ascertain the laws which govern the heavenly bodies, and by which their motions are directed; investigate the power by which they circulate in their orbs, discover their size, determine their distance, explain their vairous phenomena, and correct the fallacy of the senses by the light of truth.] The fifth of these sciences, Geometry, is deemed principally essential in Masonry. By it the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs, the gen - eral, to arrange his soldiers, the engineer to mark out grounds for encampments, the geographer to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empir~s, kingdoms and prov - inces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the dura - tions of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the foundation of archi - tecture and the root of mathematics. * * * * * I"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w~ stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus. n 1 w. stichtingargus. n I w. stichtingargus. ‘ii w.stichtingargus. iii xv.sfichtingargus. iii xv. stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingargLI~. iii xv.stichti ngargu~. n I xv.stichtingaI’~II~J ill xv. stichd ii~ii i~j i~. iii xv.stichtin~ria ~tII~J iii I, I,i 81 * * * * * 6 . 80 THE MONITOR * * * * * THE EMBLEM OF PLENTY * * * * Ft LLOW-CRAFT * * * * * * * * * -~ m~ ’"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"82 THE MONITOR * * * * * The Moral Advantages of Geometry. Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Freemasonry is erected. By Geometry we may curiously trace nature, through her va - ½ riouswindings, to her most concealed recesses. By it we disc6ver the power, wisdom and goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Urn- verse, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their dif - ferent orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us (all framed by the same Divine Artist), which roll through the vast expanse, and all are conducted by the same unerring laws of nature. A survey of Nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined, man to imitate the divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to So - cieties, and birth to every useful art. The F FELLOW-CRArT 83 architect began to design, and the plans whic& he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the ~dniiration o~ every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ig norance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable mon - uments~ of antiquity, On which the utmost ex - ertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of ~olomon, so spacious and magnificenl, and constructed by so many cele - brated artists, escaped not the unsparing rav - ages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still sur - vived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the sacred mysteries are safely lodged in the repository of farthful breasts. Tools and implements of architecture, sym - bols the most ‘expressive? are selected by the Fraternity, to imprint on the memory wise and serious truths; and thus, through a suc - cession of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired the excellent teziets of our institution."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"TIlE MONITOR m * * * * * * * Corn, Wine and Oil. * * * * * This closes the second section, and finishes the degreewith the exception of the charge, which is as follows: - Charge to the Candidate.

As a man, he should be of approved integ - rity and irreproachable morals, frebd from the dominion of hasty temper and ill-governed passions; of good repute in the world, and practicing, as an example to the Craft, the cardinal virtues of Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice.

MASONIC BIJRIAL SERVICE. The custom of interring the d 9 ad with some solemnity is general among all nations— whether savage and ignorant, or ~ivilized and enlightened. In discharging a duty v~e owe to all, it insures proper respect to the mortal re - mains of a deceased brother, whatever may have been his failings; and it affords an op - portunity for the happy recollection of his virtues, as well as of giving a testimony of the estimation in which they were held. It also chiefly serves to remind those who par - ticipate in it of their Own mortality, and of the importance of being prepared for Death, which must come upon all. The ceremonies ob - served on such occasions vary in different nations and societies. Those observed by Ma - sons have an ancient origin, and refer to one of the most important traditions of the Order. They are uniform throughout the Masonic World, in some general and essential matters; and, though they differ in details, being sub - ject to regulations by the legislative authority 177 12"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"1w. stichtingargus•i ~I iw.stichtingargus.ril ‘xv. stichtingargus.nI iw.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~rw. stichtingargus.nl ~rw. stichtingargus.nl vxv.stichtingargus.nl iw.sti chtingargus.nl vw ‘~aichtingargiis.n1 ~xx ~hIchtIngargus.n1 xx ‘dichtingargus.nl xx .stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~‘w.stichtingargus.n1 iw stichtingargus.nl /W .stichtingargus.nI iw. stichtingargus.ni ‘xv. sticht ~ngargus.n1 iw.stichtingargus.nl 1w. sticht ingargus.nl 1W.Stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W.Stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichti ngargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus~n I ‘xv.stichtingargus iii 178 THE MONITOR of the Order, they should be uniform in each Grand Lodge jurisdiction, and to that end—• The Grand Lodge of Texas hereby estab - lishes the following as the Burial Service to be used by Subordinate Lodges in Texas: Rules. 1.

Extracted from the Ancient Records of Lodges beyond the sea, and of those in England, Scotland, and Ireland, for the nse of the Lodges in London; t6 be read at the making of new brethren, or when the Master shall order it. I. Concerning Cod and Religion.—A Mason is obliged by his tenure to obey the moral law, and if he rightly understands the art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious libertine. But though in ancient times, Masons were charged in every country to be of the religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, yet, it is now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves, that is, to be good men and true, or men of honor and honesty, by what - ever denominations or persuasions they may be distinguished; whereby Masonry becomes the center of union, and the means of concil - iating true friendship among persons that must have remained at a perpetual distance."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"248 THE MONITOR III. Of the Civil Magistrates, Supreme and Sub - ordinate—A Mason is to be a peaceable sub - ject to the civil powers, wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in plots and conspiracies against the peace and wel - Thre of the nation, nor to behave himself un - dutifully to inferior magistrates, for, as Masonry hath been always injured by war, bloodshed, and confusion, so ancient kings and princes have been much disposed to encourage the Craftsmen, because- of their peaceableness and loyalty, whereby they practically an - swered the cavils of their adversaries, and promoted the honor of the Fraternity, who ever flourished in times of peace. So that if a brother be a rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanced in hs rebellion; however, he may be pitied as an unhappy man; and, if convicted of no other crime, though the loyal brotherhood must and ought to disown his rebellion, and give no umbrage or ground of political jealousy to the government for the time being, they can - not expel him from the Lodge, and his rela - tion to it remains indefeasible. III. Of Lodges—A Lodge is a place where Ma - sons assemble and work; hence, that assembly, or duly organized society of Masons, is called r GRAND LODGE CONSTITUTION -249 a Lodge, and every brother ofrght to belong to one, and to be subject to its by-laws, and the general regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annexed. In ancient times, no Master or Fellow could be absent from it, especially when warned to appear at it, without incurring a severe censure, un - til it appeared to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hindered him. The persons admitted members of a Lodge must be good and true men, free-born, and of a mature and discreet age; no bondman, no woman, no immoral or scandalous men, but of good report. IV.

It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every brother must at - tend his place, and learn them in a way pe - culiar to this Fraternity.

No brother can be a Warden until he has passed the part of a Fellow Craft; nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor a Grand Warden unless he has been Master of a Lodge; nor Grand Master unless he has been a Fellow Craft before his election, who is also to be nobly born, or a gentleman of the best fashion, or some eminent scholar, or some curious architect, or other artist, descended of honest parents, and who is of singular great merit in the opinion of the Lodges. And for the better and easier and more honorable discharge of his office, the Grand Master has a power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular Lodge, and has the privilege of acting whatever the Grand Mas - ter, his principal, should act, unless the said principal be present, or interpose his authority by a letter.

GRAND LODGE CONSTIrJJT,oN 253 VI. 1. Of Behavior in the Lodge While Con - stituted. \\‘uu are not to hold private committees, or separate conversation, without leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinent or unseemly, nor interrupt the ~4aster or Wardens, or any brother speaking to the Master; nor behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn ;~nor use any unbecom - ing language upon any pretense whatsoever; but to pay due reverence to your Master, Wardens and Fellows, and put them to wor - ship. If any complaint be brought, the brother found guilty shall stand to the award and de - termination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent judges of all such contro - versies (unless you carry it by appeal to the Grand Lodge), and to whom they ought to be referred, unless a lord’s wurl< be hindered the meanwhile, in which case a particular ref - erence may be made; but you must never go to law about what concernetla Masonry, with - out an absolute necessity apparent to the Lodge. 2. Behavior after the Lodge is over, and the Brethren not gone. You may enjoy yourselves with innocent mirth, treating one another according to abil -"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"254 THE MONITOR ity, and avoiding all excess, or forcing any brother to eat or drink beyond his inclina - tion, or hindering him from going when his occasions call him, or doing or saying any - thing offensive or that may forbid an easy and free conversation; for that would blast our harmony and defeat our laudable pur - poses. Therefore, no private piques or quar - rels must be brought within the door of the Lodge, far less any quarrels about religion, or nations, or state policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholic religion above men - tioned, we are also of all nations, tongues, kindreds, and languages, and are resolved against all politics, as what never yet con - duced to the welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This charge has been always strictly enjoined and observed; but especially ever since the reformation in Britain, or the dis - sent and secession of these nations from the communion of Rome. 3. Behavior when, Brethren meet without Strangers, but not ~n a Lodge formed. You are to salute one another in a courteous manner as you will be instructed, calling each other brother, freely giving mutual instruction, as shall be thought expedient, without being overseen or overheard, and without encroach - ing upon each other, or derogating from that respect which is due to any brother, were he not a Mason; for though all Masons are as brethren upon the same level, yet Masonry GRAND LODGE CONSTITIJI ION 2S~ takes no honor from a man that he had be - fore; nay, rather, it adds to his honor, espec - ially if he has deserved well of the brother - hood, who must give honor to whom it is due, and avoid ill manners 4. Behavior in presence of Strangers not Masons. You shall be cautious in your words and carriage, that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and, sometimes, ~you shall divert a discourse, and manage it prudently for the honor of the worshipful Fraternity. 5. Behavior at Home and in your Neigh - borhood. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise man, particularly, not to let your family, friends and neighbors 1<now the concerns of the Lodge, etc., but ~visely to consult your own honor, and that of the ancient brother - hood, for reasons not to be mentioned here. You must also consult your health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from home, after Lodge hours are past; and by avoiding of gluttony or drunkenness, that your families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working. 6. Behavior toward a strange Brother. You are cautiously to examine him, in such •a method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant —I C j"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"256 THE MONITOR GRAND LODGE CONSTITUTION 257 false pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and derision, and beware of giving him any hints of knowledge.

You must employ him some days, or else recommend him to be em - ployed.

And if any of them do you injury, you must apply to your own or his Lodge, and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge at the quarterly communication, and from thence to the annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable conduct of our forefathers in every nation, never taking a legal course, but when the case cannot be otherwise decided, and patiently listening to the honest and friendly advice of Master and Fellows, when they would prevent your going to law with strangers, or would excite you to put a speedy period to all law suits, that so you may mind the affairs of Masonry with the more alacrity and success, but with respect to brothers or fellows at law, the Master and brethren should kindly offer their mediation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the contending brethren; and if that submission is impracti - cable, they must, however, carry on their process or law suit, without wrath and rancor •(not in the common way), saying or doing nothing which may hinder brotherly love and good offices to be renewed and continued; that all may see the benign influence of Ma - sonry, a~ all true Masons have done from the beginning of the world, and will do to the end of time.
