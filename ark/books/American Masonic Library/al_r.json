Freemasonry is not only the most ancient, but most moral science known to man. Every character, emblem and figure depicted in a lodge has a moral and useful meaning, and forcibly inculcates the practice of virtue A LODGE is a certain number of Masons duly assembled, with the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses and a Charter or Warrant empowering them to work. Ic— Our ancient brethren usually held their Lodges on high hills or in low vales, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eaves - droppers, either ascending or descending. ENTERED APPRENTICE. 19 THE FORM OF A LODGE is an oblong square—from east to west, and between north and south, from earth to heaven, and from surface to centre. These vast di - mensions denote the universality of Masonry, and a Mason’s charity should be equally ex - tensive. OUR INSTITUTION is supported by three great pillars, Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, because it is necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MASONIC RITUAL. 20 ENTERED APPRENTICE, 21 T xv. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl tw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw . stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl ;w.stichtingargus.nl W N lie h ii ngargus.nl ‘Wst ichtingargus.nl ‘W .Stlchtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtinga4us.nl w.stichtingargus.nl T xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.n 1 w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.sfichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.hl w.stichtingargus.nl ITS COVERING is no less than a clouded canopy or starry- decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by aid of the theological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw extending from earth to heaven; the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope and Charity, and which admonish us to have faith in God, hope in immortality, and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity, for faith may he lost in sight; hope ends in fruition; but charity extends beyond the grave through the boundless realms of eternity.

MY BROTHER As you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honorable Oider—ancient, as having existed from time immemorial, and honorable, as tending in every particular so to render all men who will be conforniable to its precepts No institution was ever raised on a better pi iiiciple or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the seveial Masonic lectures The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dig - nity to level themselves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties which, I as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate-—to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, In never mentioning His name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Greatoii to implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you, and to yourself, in avoiding all irregulasity and intemperance which may impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous at - tachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet and peace - ful subject, true to your government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor, be par - ticularly careful to avoid censure and re - proach. Although your frequent appearance at em regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry shall interfere with your necessary vocations; for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"34 MASONIC RITUAL. rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ~ rw.stichtingargus .nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl tw.stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.iil 1W .stichtingarguS.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl 1W.sti cht ingargus.nl ,w.stichti ngargus.nl iw.~iiichtingargus.n1 ‘w,st chtingargus.nl /w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W .stichtingargus.nl 1W.stlchtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingar~us.nl rw.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.ni w.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘W.stlchtingargus .nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stlchtingargus.nl u; vtiohtinhyrarrni~ ni into argument with those who, through ignor - ance, may ridicule it.

Finally, keep sacred and inviolate the mys - teries of the Order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly attentive not to recommend him unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory and reputation of the institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects.

The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to raise perpendiculars; the Square, to square the work, and the Level, to lay horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes. The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations before God and man, squaring our actions by the Square of viitue, and remember - ing that we are traveling upon the level of time to “that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns * * * * C * * SECTION SECOND The second section of this degree refers to the origin of the institution and views Masonry under two denom - nations, operative and specuiative The period stipulated for rewarding merit is here fixed, and the inimitable moral to which that circumatance alludes is explained.

It furnishes us with dwellings and con - venient shelters from the vicissitudes and in- clemencies of seasons; and while it displays the effects of hunian wisdom, as well in the choice, as in the arrangement, of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demon - strates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man, for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. SPECULATIVE MASONRY. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligation to pay that ra - tional homage to the Deity which at once con - stitutes our duty and our happiness.

By Order in Architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornaments of columns and pilasters, or It 15 a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole ITS ANTIQUITY. From the first formation of society, Order in Architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from FELLOW CRAFT. 41 the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on ends, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at the top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: The Tus - can, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE. The ancient and original Orders in Archi - tecture revered by Masons are no more than three—the Done, Ionic and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two—the Tuscan and the Composite. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, are we indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in Architecture. * * * i * * * As the Five Orders of Architecture are considered in this section, a brief description of them may not be improper."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"FELLOW CRAFT. 48 rw.stichtingargus.nI rw.stichtingargus.nl ~ rw.stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingargus.nl SW.stichtingargus.nl SW.stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl ,‘w.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl SW. sticht ingargus.nl /w.Ntichti ngargus.nl iw~d ichti ngargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl SW.stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl SW.stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingar~us.n1 rw.stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 w. stichtingargus.ffl ~xv.stichtingargus.n1 ~‘v. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.fil w.stichtingargus.nl 42 MASONIC RITUAL THE FIVE SEN S~ES OF HUMAN NATURE. The Five Senses of Human Nature, which are Hearing, Seeing, Feeling. Smelling and Tasting. are next referred to and explained. * k * * * * * THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy. The science of Geometry is most revered by Masons. Geometry treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered; from a point to a line; from a line to a super - ficies; and from a superficies to a solid. A point is position without magnitude. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity—namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions —namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions— namely, length, breadth and thickness. THE ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY By this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general, to arrange his soldiers; the geog - rapher, to give us the dimensions of the world and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observa - tions, and to fix the duration of time and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, geometry is the foundation of architecture, and the root of mathematics. * * i * * * * A SYMBOL OF PLENTY. -~ What does it denote? How was it represented?

By it we may discover the power, the wisdom and the goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with de]ight the propor - tions which connect this vast machine. By it we may discover how the planets move in their different orbits, and demonstrate their various revoluUons. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse and are all con - ducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, ahd the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the divine plan, and study sym - metry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monu - ments of antiquity, on which the utmost exer - tions of human genius have been employed. FELLOW CRAFT. 45 Even the temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent and constructed by so many cele - brated artists, escaped not the unsparing rav - ages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, not - withstanding, has still survived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. Tools and instruments of architecture, and symbolic emblems, most expressive, are selected by the fraternity, ~o imprint on the mind wise and serious truths; and thus through a succession of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired, the most excellent tenets of our institution. * ,A * * * * i CHARGE AT PASSING TO THE DEGREE OF FELLOW CRAFT.

You are not to palliate or aggravate the offenses o~ your brethren; but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnest]y rec - ommended to your consideration, especially the science of Geometry, which is established as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the won - derful properties of nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now conferred, and in your new character it is ~x- pected that you will conform to the princ~ples of the Order, by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue.

The high and distinguished honor of perfoiming this sacred service was denied David, King of Thiael, because he had becn a man of blood. But he i eceived a pronnse from the true and living God that he would raise up a seed to serve him, which divine and gracious promise was fulfilled in the person of Solomon, his son, who succeeded him in the kingdoim No sooner had this wise k]ilg ascended the throne of his father and begun to wield the sceptre over Israel than he took measui es to execute the high and holy task which had been imposed upon hIm, that of building a house to the Lord his God At this time the noise of war had ceased in all the land, and peace reigned throughout its boi ders. The children of Israel now looked forward with peculiar satisfaction for a display of that wisdom which was to astonish the world. We are informed by the writings of Josephus, as well as the Holy Scriptures, that in the second month of the fourth year of King Solomon’s reign, and in the third year after the death of David, he began to build the temple; and during its whole progress, which was about seven years and six months, Masonic tradition informs us that it rained not, except in the night or at a time when the craft was at refreshment, thereby evincing a miraculous inteiposition of divine providence in that great and glorious work. This famous edifice was situated on Mount Moriah, near the place where Abraham, the father of the faithful, was about to offer up his son Isaac in trial of his faith, and where David met and appeased the destroying angel, who was visible over the threshing floor of Oman, the Jebusite, and when near its com - pletion it shone with such refulgent splendor as to excite the wonder and admiration of all who beheld it. * * ~ * * * *"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"56 MASONIC RITUAL. ~w.stichtingargus.nI 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.StiChti ngargus .nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w .stichtingargus.nl iw.stichfingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nI ~ ~l k I di ii~uirgus.nI \\‘~ ~dichttngargus.n1 ‘w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus .nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.StiChti ngar~us.n1 1w.Stichtiflgargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.hl w. stichtingargus.nl These three pillars have been explained in a former degree.

In youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to oc - cupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in manhood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to Cod, our neighbors and ourselves; that so in age as Master Ma - sons, we may enjoy the happy reflections con - sequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. THE POT OF INCENSE is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so should our heai ts continually glow with gratitude to the great boneficeni Author of our exist- ence, for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. THE BEE HIVE is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created be - ings, from the highest seraph in heaven to the lowest rep - tile of the dust. it teaches us that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones, never sitting down contented while our fellow creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve them without incon - venience to ourselves.

This wise philosopher en - riched his mind abundantly in a general knowl - edge of things, but more especially in geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many pioblems and theorems; and among the most distinguished, he erected this, which, in the joy of his heart, he called iiEureka~~ in the Grecian language signifying, “I have found it”, and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb.

I. CONCERNING GOD AND RELIGION. A Mason is obliged by his tenure to obey the morai iaw, and if he rightiy understands the Art he will never be a stupid atheist nor an irreiigious iibertine. But though in aneient times Masons were charged in every country to be of the reiigion of that country or nation, woatever it was. yet it is now thought more expedient oniy to obiige them to that reilgion in which sii men agree, leaving their particuiar opinions to themselves —that is, to be good men and true, or men of honor and honesty, by whatever denominations or persuasions they may be distinguished, whereby Masonry becomes the centre of union, and the means of conciliating true friendship among persons that must have remained at a perpecu~sl distance. II. OF THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE, SUPREME AND SUBORDINATE A Mason is a peaceable subject to tne civil powers wherever he resides or works, and is never to be con - cerned in plots and conspiracies agairst the peace and welfare of the nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior magistrates, for as Masonry bath been oisvays injured by war, bloodshed and confusion, so ancient kings and princes have been much disposed to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their peaceabieness and 1nsalty. whereby they practically answered the ravils of rneir adversaries, and promoted the honor of the Fraternity. who ever flourished in times of peace; so that if a brother should be a rebel against the State, he is not to tie coun - tenanced in his rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy roan, and if convicted of no other crime, though the loyal brotherhood must and ought to disown his re - hellion, and give no umbrage or ground of political jeal - ousy to the government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge and his reaction to it remains indefeasible III. OF LODGES. A Lodge is a place where Masons assemble and work: hence that assembly or duly organized society of Masons is called a Lodge, and every brother ought to belong to one, and be subject to its by-laws and general regulations It is either particular or general, and will be best under - stood by attending it. and by the regulations of the Gen - eral or Grand Lodge hereunto annexed. In the ancient times no Mason or Fellow could be absent from it. es - pecially when warned to appear at it, without incurring a severe censure, until it appeared to the Master or Warden that pure necessity hindered him. The persons admitting members of a Lodge must be good and true men, free born and of mature and discreet age. No boodmen, no women, no immoral or scandalous men, but of good report. IV OF MASTERS, WARDENS, FELLOWS AND APPRENTICES All preferment among Masons is grounded upon real worth and personal merit only, that so the Lord may be well served, the brethren not put to shame, nor the Royal Craft despised, therefore no Master or Warden is chosen by seniority, but for his merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every brother must attend in his place, and learn them in a way peculiar to his Fraternity Only candidates may know that no Master should take an apprentice unless he have sufficient em - ployment for him, and unless he be a perfect youth, having no maim or defect in his body that may render him incapable of learning the Art, of serving his Master’s Lord, and of being made a brother, and then a Fellow Craft in due time, even after he has served such a term of years as the custom of the country directs, and that he should be descended of honest parents, that so, when otherwise qualified, he may arrive to the honor of being the Warden, and then the Master of the Lodge. the Grand Warden and at length the Grand Master of all the Lodges, according to his merit."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"68 MASONIC RITUAL.

And far the better and easier and more hon - orable discharge of his office, the Gratid Master has a power to choose his awn Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been foi-rnerly, the Master of a particular Lodge, and has the privilege of acth2g whatever the Grand Master, his principal, should act. unless the said principal be present, or interpose his authority by a letter. These rulers and governors, supreme and subordinate of the ancient Lodge. are to be obeyed in their respective staUons by a!! the brethren, according to the old charges and regulations, with aD humility, reverence, love and alacrity. V. OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CRAFT IN WORKING. AU Masons shall work honestly on working days, that they may jive creditably on holy days. and the time appointed by the jaw of the land or confirmed by custom, shall be observed. The most expert of the Fellow Craftsmen shall be eho~en or appointed the Master or Overseer of the Lord’s work, who is to be culled ?~1aster by those that work under him The Crattsmen are to avoid all ill language, and to call each other by no disobliging name, but Brother or Fellow, and to behave themselves courteously within and without the Lodge. The Master, knowing himself to be able of cunning, shall utidertake the Lord’s work as reasonably as possible. and truly disperid his goods as if they were his own, nor to give more wages to any Brother or Apprentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons receiving the¶r wages justly shall be f~uthfuI to the Lord, arid honestly finish their work, whether task or ~ourne~I, nor put the work to task that has been accustomed to ~ou~ietj. None shall discover envy at the prosperity a~ a brother, nor supplant him, or put him out of his work, if he be capable to finish the same. Cor no man can finish an- others work so much to the Lord’s profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the designs and draughtB of him that began When a Fellow Craftsman is chosen Warden of the work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fellows: shall carefully overRee the work in the Master’s absence, to the Lord’s profit, atid his brethren shaU obey him. A~J Masons employed shall meekly receive their wages, without niurrnurzng or mutiny, and not desert the Master until the work is finished. A younger brother shall be instructed in workiiig. to prevent spoiling the materials for want of judgment, arid for increasing and continuing of biotherly love. A]! the tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge. No Jaborcr shall be empIo~’ed in the proper work ot Masonry nor shall Freemasons work with those that are not free, without an urgent necessity, nor shall they teach Jaboreys and u’.~accepted Masons, as they should teach a Brother or Fellow. VI OF BEHAVIOR—VIZ: I In the Lodge Wh~le Co,istrtuted. You are not to hold private committees, or separate cotiversabon, without leave from ~he Master, nor to talk of anyUiing impertinent or unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any brother speaking to the Master: nor behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious arid solemn, nor use any unbecoming language upon any pretense what-. soevel-. but to pay due reverence to your Master. Wardens, arid FeUows, and put them to worship. If any complaint be brought, the brother found guilty shall stand to the award nnd determination of the Lodge, who are the proper and corn”etent audges of all such con - troversies (unless you carry it by appeal to the Grand Lodge) and to whom they ought to be referred, unless a Lords work be hindered the meanwhile, in which case a particula reference may be made, but you must never go"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"70 MASONIC RITUAL. rw.stichtingargus.nI 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl iw. sticht ingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl XX’ ~;IIt Id I l1~lhI~gLIS.flI ‘A ‘~iicliflflgargusflI /w. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus .nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtingargus.nl 1w.Stichtiflgargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.i-il w. stichtingargus.nl to law about what concerneth Masonry, without an ab - solute necessity apparent to tue Lodge. I. Behavior After the Lodge is Over, and the Brethren sot Gone. You may enjoy yourself with innocent mirth, treating one another according to ability, but avoid - ing all excess, or forcing any biother to eat or drink beyond his inclination, or hindering him from going when his occasion calls him, or doing or saying any - thing offensive, or that may forbid an easy and free conversation, for that would blast our harmony and defeat our laudable purposes Therefore, no private piques or quarrels mutt be brought within the door of the Lodge, far less any quarrels about religion or nations or State policy We being only, as Masons, of the catholic religion above mentioned, we are also, of all nations, tongues, kindreds and languages, and are resolved against ali politics, as what never yet conduced to the welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will This charge has always been strictly enjoined and observed, but especially since the reformation in Britain, or the dissent and seces - sion of these nations from the communion of Rc,nie 3 Behavior when Brethren Meet W,fhout Strangers, but not in a Lodge Formed, You are to salute one another in a courteous mannei, as you wiii be instructed — calling each other brothei, freeiy giving mutual instruction, as shall be thought ,xpeilient, without being overseen or overheard and ~vith- out encroaching upon each other, or derogating from that respect which is due to any brother were he not a Mason, for, though all Masons are as brethren upon the same Level, yet Masonry takes no honor from a man that be had before—nay, ruther it adds to his honor, especially if he has deserved well of the Brotherhood, who must give honor to whom it is due, and avoid ill manners 4. Behavior in Presence of Strangers Not Masons, You shall be cautious in your words and carriage, that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to dis - cover or find out what is not pioper to be intimated; and sometimes you shall divert a discourse, and manage it prudently, for the honor of the Worshipful Fraternity ANCIENT LANDMARKS. 71 ii. Behavior at Home and in Your Neighborhood. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise man, par - ticularly not to let your faniily. fiiends and neighbors know the concerns of the Lodge, etc, but wisely consult your own honor, and that of the ancient brotherhood, for reasons not to be mentioned here You must also consult your health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from home after Lodge hours are past, and by avoid - ing of gluttony and drunkenness, that your families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working. 6 Behavior Towards a Strange Brother. You are cautiously to examine him on such a method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be im - posed upon by an ignorant, false pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and derision, and beware of giving him any hints of knowledge, but if you discover him to be a true and genuine brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be re - lieved, you must employ him come days, or else recom - mend him to be employed But you are not charged to do beyond your ability—only to prefer a poor brother, that is a good man and true, before any other poor people in the same circumstances, Finally, all these charges you are to observe, and also, those that shall be communicated to you in another way— cultivating brotherly love, the foundation and capStone— the cement and glory of this ancient Fraternity, avoiding all wrangling and quarreling, all slander and backbiting, not permitting others to slander any honest brother, but defending his character and doing him all good offices, so far as is consistent with your honor and safety, and no farther. and if any of them do you injury, you must apply to your own or his Lodge, and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge at the Quarterly Com - munication, and Irom thence to the Annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable conduct of our fore - fathers in every nation—never taking a legal course but when the case cannot be otherwise decided, and patiently listening to the honest and friendly advice of Master and Fellows, when they would psevent you going to law with strangeis, or would excite you to put a speedy period to all law suits, that so you may mind the affairs of Masonry with more alacrity and success But with"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"72 MASONIC RITTJkL.

Amen, So mote it be. Masonic Funeral Service GENERAL DIRECTIONS. I. No brother can be interred with the formalities of the Order unless he has received the Third Degree of Masonry. II.

The Master here takes the roll on which is inscribed the name, age and Masonic history of the deceased, and says: ALMIGHTY FATHER! In thy hands we leave, with humble submission, the soul of our de - parted brother. The brethren will respond three times, giving the funeral grand honors each time. The will o~ God is accomplished. So mote it be. Amen. The Master here deposits the roll in the archives and repeats the following or some other suitable prayer: Most glorious and merciful Lord God! Our Heavenly Father! Author of all good and giver of all mercy! Pour down Thy blessings upon us, and strengthen our solemn engage - ments with the ties of sincere affection! May the present instance of mortality remind us of our approaching fate, and draw our attention toward Thee, the only refuge in time of need: that, when the awful moment shall arrive that we are about to quit this transitory scene, the enlivening prospect of Thy mercy may dispel the gloom of death; that after our departure hence in peace, we may be received into Thine everlasting kingdom, and there enjoy, in union with our departed friends, the just reward of a pious and virtuous life.

Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is. For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work; and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye, therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; lest coming suddenly, he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all. Watch. (*St. Mark xiii, 33-37.) Master—What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? (Ps. lxxxix, 48.) Response—I will ransom them from the power of the grave: I will redeem them from death. O death, I will be thy plagues: 0 grave, I will be thy destruction! (Hosea xiii, 14.)

The Lodge of Sorrow, on th* contrary, is intended to celebrate the memory of our de parted brethren; and while we thus recall to our recol lection their virtues, and temper anew our resolutions so to live that when we shall have passed the silent portals. our memories may be cherished with grateful remembrance We learn to look upon death from a more elevated point of view, to see in it the wise and necessary transition from the trials and imperfections of this world. to the perfect life for which our transient journey here has been ihe school and the preparation. Vocal and in - strumental music are indispensable to the proper effect of the ceremonc. The brethren should wear dark clothing and white gloves and aprons. There is no necessity for any attempt at secrecy in the ceremonies of Sorrow Lodges.

Masons should always remember that when human strength and wisdom fail, they have an inex - haustible fountain of both open to them from above, through the medium of prayer. Brothers Senior and Junior Wardens, join me around these solemn emblems of mortality, and assist me in paying the last Masonic honors to our departed brethren. The wardens, Deacons and Stewards will now ap. proach the East and form a procession, thus: Two Stewards with white rods; Two wardens with columns; The worshipful Master, supported by the Senior and 3unior Deacons with black cods. The procession will move once around the catafaique to slow and solemn music (Pleyci’s Hymn is very ap - propriate). On arriving at the East, the procession will halt and open to the right and left. The 3unior warden will then advance to the catafaique, and, placing upon it a bunch of white flowers, will say Junior Warden—In memory of our departed brethren, I deposit these white flowers, emble - matic of that pure life to which they have been called, and reminding us that as these children of an hour will droop and fade away, so, too, we shall soon follow those who have gone before us, and inciting us so to fill the brief span of our existence that we may leave to our survivors a sweet savor of remembrance. 1’ RITUAL FOR A LODGE OF SORROW. 111 Here the Funeral Grand Honors are given once.

Senior Warden — Worshipful Sir, man judgeth not of man. He, whose infinite and tender mercy passeth all comprehension, whose goodness enduretli forever, has called our brethren hence. Let Him judge. In ancient Egypt, no one could gain admit - tance to the sacred asylum of the tomb until he had passed under the most solemn judg - ment before a grave tribunal. Princes and peasants came there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted the history of their lives, and threw the penetrating light of truth on their actions. If it were adjudged that the dead man had led an evil life, his memory was condemned in the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. Masonry has no such tribunal to sit in judg - ment upon her dead; with her, the good which her sons have done lives after them, and the evil is interred with their bones. She does require, however, that whatever is said con - cerning them shall be the truth; and should it ever happen that of a Mason who dies noth - ing good can be truthfully said, she will mourn - fully and pityingly bury him out of her sight, in silence. RITUAL FOR A LODGE OF SORROW. 119 Worshipful Master—Brethren, let us profit by the admonitions of this solemn occasion; lay to heart the truths to which we have listened, and resolve so to walk that when we lay us down to the last sleep, it may be the privilege of the brethren to strew white flowers upon our graves, and keep our memories as a pleas - ant remembrance. Brother Senior Warden, announce to the brethren that our labors are now concluded, and that it is my pleasure that this Lodge of Sorrow be now closed. Senior Warden—Brother Junior Warden, the labors of this Lodge of Sorrow being now ended, it is the pleasure of the Worshipful Master that it be now closed. Make due an - nouncement to the brethren, and invite them to assist.

Suffer me to point it out to you, and to impress upon your minds the ennobling sentiments they are so well adapted to convey. This hall, designed and built by Wisdom, supported by Strength, and adorned in Beauty, we are first to consecrate in the name of the great Jehovah; which teaches us, in all our works, begun and finished, to acknowledge, adore and magnify Him. It reminds us, also, in His fear to enter the door of the Lodge, to put our trust in Him while passing its trials, and to hope in Him for the reward of its labors. Let, then, its altar be devoted to His service, and its lofty arch resound With His praise. May the eye which seeth in secret witness here the sincere and unaffected piety which with - draws from the engagements of the world to silence and privacy, that it may be exercised with less interruption and less ostentation. Our march around the Lodge reminds us of the travels of human life, in which Masonry is an enlightened, a safe, and a pleasant path.

In its prosperity, we find our joy; and, in pay - ing it honor, we honor ourselves. But its worth transcends our encomiums, and its glory will outsound our praise. Brethrei’, it is our pride that we have our names or. tht record of Freemasonry. May it be our high ambition that they should shed a lustre on the immortal page! The hall is also dedicated to Virtue. This worthy appropriation will always be duly regarded, while the moral duties which our sublime lectures inculcate, with effective and impressive pertinency, are cherished in our hearts and illustrated in our lives. As Freemasonry aims to enliven the spirit of Philanthropy and promote the cause of Charity, so we dedicate this hall to Universal Benevo - lence; in the assurance that every brother will dedicate his affections and his abilities to the same generous purpose; that while he displays a warm and cordial affection to those who are of the Fraternity, he will extend his benevo -"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"1w.stichtingargus .nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.StlChtl ngargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stiChtingargus.nl 1W.stiChtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl /w.NI ichi i ngargus.nI rwi;iI kiui I iigargus.nl 1W ~dichtingargus.n1 ‘w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stiChtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus .nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 1w.StiChtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.ni w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.fd w. stichtingargus.nl 148 MASONIC RITUAL. lent regards and good wishes to the whole family of mankind. Such, my brethren, is the significant mean - ing of the solemn rites we have just performed, because such are the peculiar duties of every Lodge. I need not enlarge upon them now, nor show how they diverge, as rays from the cen - tre, to enlighten, to improve, and to cheer the whole circle of life. Their import and their ap - plication is familiar to you all. In their knowl - edge and their exercise may you fulfill the high purposes of the Masonic Institution. How many pleasing considerations, my breth - ren, attend the present interview! While in almost every other association of men, political animosities, contentions and wars interrupt the progress of humanity and the cause of benevo - lence, it is our distinguished privilege to dwell together in peace, and engage in plans to per - fect individual and social happiness. While in many other nations our Order is viewed by politicians with suspicion, and by the ignorant with apprehension, in this country its members are too much respected and its principles too well known to make it the object of jealousy or mistrust. Our private assemblies are un - molested and our public celebrations attract a more general approbation of the Fraternity. Indeed, its importance, its credit, and, we trust, DEDICATLON OF MASONIC HALLS. 149 its usefulness, are advancing to a height un - known in any former age. The present oc - casion gives fresh evidence of the increasing affection of its friends; and this noble apart - ment, fitted up in a style of such elegance and convenience, does honor to Freemasonry, as well as reflects the highest credit on the re - spectable Lodge for whose accommodation and at whose expense it is erected. We offer our best congratulations to the Worshipful Master, Wardens, officers and members of the Lodge. We commend their zeal and hope it will meet with the most ample recompense. May their hall be the happy re - sort of piety, virtue and benevolence; may it be protected from accidents and long remain a monument of their attachments to Freema - sonry! May their Lodge continue to flourish, their union to strengthen, and their happiness to abound! And when they and we all shall be removed from the labors of the earthly Lodge, may we be admitted to the brotherhood of the perfect, in the building of God, the hall not made with hands, eternal in the heaven.

Charge them to practice out of the Lodge those duties which they have been taught in it, and, by amiable, discreet and virtuous conduct, to con - vince mankind of the goodness of the institu - tion, so that, when a person is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows; to whom distress may prefer its suit; whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is e,cpanded by benevolence.

From the spirit which you have hitherto evinced, I entertain no doubt that your future conduct will be such as to merit the approval of your brethren and the testimony of a good conscience. CHARGE TO THE BRETHREN OF THE LODGE. Brethren of Lodge U.~.D.. (who are called up by three raps): You have been formed under a dispensation into a Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, and are empowered to confer the several degrees of Ancient Craft Masonry, and to transact the necessary busi - ness incident thereto. Your authority is strictly limited by the law of the Grand Lodge, of F.. & A.. M... of Alabama, and your continuance as a Lodge under dispensation is subject to the will and pleasure of the Grand Master, who may at any time revoke the authority under which you are now working. It is your duty, as officers and members to strictly obey ~he law, and in order to do so you should carefully study all of its provisions, as any departure therefrom may subject you to censure, and might result in the recalling of your dispensation. Lodges are first instituted under dispensa - tion as a test of ~he ability of the officers and brethren to properly perform the duties in - cumbent upon them, and if, after due trial, they are found worthy and well qualified, they are constituted and formed into regular Lodges, with full power to work under charter. In addition to observing the law, it will also be the duty of the officers to conform to the iules and regulations of the Grand Lodge in regard to work. The Grand Lodge has its own esoteric or secret work, and has District Lec - turers to teach it, and Lodges are required to conform strictly thereto. The ritual adopted by the Grand Lodge must be used, and no other. The desire on the part of Lodges under dispensation to confer degrees upon applicants too often results in the admission into our Fra - ternity of some who are not worthy and well qualified.

The jewels of the several officers should be laid orderly and conveniently upon a table in front of the installing officer. This ceremony, like that of constituting a Lodge under charter, or dedicating Masonic Halls, may be conducted in public or in the presence of Masons only. The Lodge should be opened in the Third Degree at its hail, and march in procession to the place where the ceremonies are to be performed; and, after they are finished, return to its hall and close. If public services are held at its hall, the Lodge should be opened and closed in an ante - room, and never in the pi’esence of profanes All things ~eiirg in order the exercises will be opened with a’-. appropriate MUSICAL SELECTION.

In the absence of the Master you are to govern the Lodge, and in his presence assist him in the government of it.

In the absence of the Master and Senior Warden, upon you devolves the government of the Lodge; but to you is especially committed the superintendence of the Craft during the hours of refreshment; it is, therefore, not only necessary that you should be temperate and discreet in the indulgence of your own inclina - tions, but carefully observe that none of the Craft convert the purpose of refreshment into intemperance or excess.

It is to age we look for wisdom and it is upon wisdom that Freemasonry builds each and every laud - able enterprise. rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingar~us.n 1 rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl - w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.hl w. stichtingargus.nl There are three steps which are symbolic of the three principal stages of human life, namely: Youth, Manhood and Age. In Youth we may industriously occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Man - hood we may apply that knowledge to the dis - charge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor and ourselves; but it is only in Age, that we may enjoy the happy reflections con - sequent upon a life well spent. It is, therefore, a source of great pride and pleasure that Lodge No. , F. & A. M. has within its midst, upon this occasion, a beloved mem - ber, who for fifty years has been a Mason.

My Brother, within the Sacred Book of Law, which always rests upon our Holy Altar, it is written that length of life is an award be - stowed by the Grand Architect of the Universe upon the righteous. The Psalmist has declared that “The days of our years are as three score and ten” and “if by reason of strength they be four score years” the additional days are the heritage of those who fear the name of the Lord. It has been your blessed privilege, My Bro - ther, to be a Mason for fifty years. For half a century, you have given of your time and your substance. Therefore, My Brother, in recognition of your record as a Mason for fifty years, the ‘-‘I Grand Lodge of Alabama has seen fit to pre - pare and bestow upon you a gold emblem as I’ a fitting award for your fifty years of Ma - sonic service. (W M. calls up the Lodge) My Brother, by virtue of the authority in me vested, it is now my happy privilege, for and on behalf of the Most Worshipful Grand FIFTY- nIAR AWARD. 21J1 Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Alabama, to present to you the Ala - bama Grand Lodge Award of Gold, as a visible token of its fraternal love and grateful ap - predation.

We congratulate you upon your high and distinguished recognition. Brother Senior Deacon: Conduct our Hon - ored Brother to a seat in the East upon the left of the Worshipful Master.

Whenever a Grand Master or a Grand Officer visits a Lodge in an official capacity he should be received with honors due to his official station. It having been made known that a brother entitled to be received with honors Is about to visit a Lodge, the Master should appoint a committee composed of those whose rank most nearly corresponds with that of the visitor, to attend upon him and ascertain his pleasure and accompany him to the Lodge. Being in the ante-room, the Tiler gives the alarm and announces Brothers A, B, C and D, escorting M. w. Brother E F, Grand or Past Grand Master of Masons In __________ unless it be on the occasion of an official visit by the Grand Master, when the announcement will be, The Most Worshipful the Grand Master, or the R. W. the Deputy Grand Master, or the R. W. the Senior Grand or Junior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge. The Master then places the Deacons at the sides of the door with their rods crossed. The brethren arrange them - selves in line from the door, on each side, extending to - wards the altar with a sufficient interval between them. The Deacon opens the door and the visitor, escorted by the committee, passes up through the lines to the altar, where the usual sign of recognition is given. The Master or some one deputed by him will then welcome the visitor. At the conclusion of the remarks the private Grand Honors will be given, when the visitor will respond If he sees fit; after which he will be escorted to a seat in the East. when the Grand Master visits a Ledge and Is escorted to the East. the Master resigns to him the seat and gavel If there be other Grand Officers, the corresponding officers of the Lodge will resign their respective seats to them also. The Grand Master, if he desices, may appoint pro Iota. Grand Officers to assist him in the visitation and in - spection. In such case they enter the Lodge immediately following him. All being seated, the Master then delivers to the Grand Master the Charter. the Treasurer’s and Secretary’s books, and a statement of the funds of the Lodge for his inspection. Having examined them and made such in - quiries as he may deem necessary concerning the affairs of the Lodge, etc. he expresses his approbation, or makes such observations as the circumstances and situa - tion of the Lodge may seem to require. The Grand Master may then resign the chair to the Master, the Grand Off icei’s (if there be any) leaving their seats and repairing to the East, the officers of the Lodge resuming their stations, and its labors will proceed as the Grand Master may direct. Reception of Visiting Bretben When a brother visits a Lodge and has been examined or vouched for, the Worshipful Master will send the Senior Deacon to introduce him. That officer conducts him to the West of the altar and says: Worshipful Master, I have the pleasure of introducing to you Brother , of_______ Lodge, No , of the Grand Lodge of_______ The Worshipful Master calls up the Lodge and says: Brother , it gives me pleasul-e to introduce to you the members of _____________ Lodge, No. , and to welcome you to a seat among us.
