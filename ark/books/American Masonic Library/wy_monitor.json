And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there he Light, and there was Light. * * * * * The three great Lights of Masonry are the Holy Bihle, Square, and Compasses. The Holy Bihle is the rule and guide of faith, the Square to square our actions and the Com - passes to circumscrihe and keep us within due hounds with all mankind, hut snore especially with a hrother Mason.

Takeit ‘~ * * * * * * * THE WORKING TOOLS The working tools of an Entered Apprentice Mason are the Twenty-four inch Gauge and the Common Gavel. THE TWENTY-FOUR INCH GAtTGE The Twenty-four inch Gauge is an implement made use of by operative masons to measure and lay out their work, but we as Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divid - ing our time. It heing divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emhlematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which ~e are taught to divide into three equal parts; wherehy we find eight hours for the service of God and a distressed f f ENTERED APPRENTICE 13 worthy hrother; eight for our usual vocations; and eight for refreshment and sleep. THE COMi~.ION GAVEL The Common Gavel is an implement made use of hy operative masons to hreak off the corners of rough stones, the hetter to fit them for the huilder’s use; hut we, as Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more nohle and glorious purpose of di - vesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life; therehy fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spiritual huilding — that house not made with hands — eternal in the heavens. SECOND SECTION THE RIGHT I-lAND The right hand was supposed hy our ancient hrethren to he the seat of fidelity; which was said sometimes to he represented hy two right hands joined, at others hy two human figures holding each other hy the right hand. ‘The right hand, therefore, was made use of as a token of our sincerity and a pledge of our fidelity in the husiness we were then entering upon. BADGE OF A MASON The lamh has in all ages heen deemed an em - hlem of innocence; he, therefore, who wears the lamnh skin as a hadge of Masonry is therehy continually reminded of that purity of life and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 ENTERED APPRENTICE conduct which is essentially necessary to his gaining admission into the celestial lodge ahove, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. THIRD SECTION A LODGE A Lodge is an assemblage of Masons duly congregated, having the Holy Bihle, Square and Compasses, and a Charter or Warrant of Con - stitu tion, authorizing them to work. WHERE HELD Our ancient hrethr~n usually met on a high hill or in a low dale, the hetter to discover the approach of cowans and eaves-droppers, either ascending or descending. Lodges at the present day are usually held in upper chamhers, prohahly for the het~er security such places afford. THE FORM The form of a Lodge is an ohlong square; in length from east to west; in hreadth, from north to south; in height, from the earth to the highest heavens; in depth, from the surface to the center. It is of such vast dimensions to show the uni - versality of Masonry, and that Masonia charity should he equally extensive. THE SUPPORTS This great fahric is supported hy three great pillars, called Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, and are so called because it is necessary there should I I 4 ENTERED APPRENTICE 15 he Wisdom to contrive, Strength to support and Beauty to adorn all great and important under - takings. * * THE COVERING Its covering is no less than the clouded canopy, or starry-decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive, hy the aid of that theo - logical ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw reaching from earth to heaven; the three prin - cipal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity; which admonish us to have faith in God, hope in immortality, and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity: for our faith may he lost in sight; hope ends in fruition; hut charity extends heyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. THE JEWELS A Lodge has six jewels; three inovahle and three immovahle. The immovable jewels are the Square, Level and Plumh. The Square teaches morality, the Level, equality, and the Plumb, rectitude of life. The movable jewels are the Rqugh Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle-hoard. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The Per - fect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of the Fellow Craft. The Trestle-board is for the Master-workman to draw his designs upon."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"16 ENTERED APPRENTICE ENTERED APPRENTICE 17 HOW SITUATED The Lodge is situated due East and West because that was the situation of King Solomon’s Temple. THE FmIN[TURE The furniture of a Lodge consists of the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses. The Bible is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man, * * * the Square to square our actions, and the Com - passes to circumscribe and keep us within due bounds with all mankind, but more especially with a brother Mason. THE ORNAMENTS The ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; and the Indented Tessel of that beautiful tessel - laied border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life checkered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel, of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. THE LIGHTS A Lodge has three lights, situated in the east, xvest and south. There is no light in the north, because King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was placed so far north of the ecliptic that the sun and moon at their meridian height could dart no rays into the northern part of the building. The north, therefore, we Masonically term a place of dark- ness. TO WHOM DEDICATED Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solomon, but Masons professing Christianity, dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist, who taught the same prin - ciples upon which Masonry is founded. TENETS The three great tenets of our profession in - culcate the practice of those truly commendable virtues, Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. BROTHERLY LOVE By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as~. one family — the high, the low, the rich, the poor — who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of- the same planet, are to aid. support, and protect one another. On this prin - ciple, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who lnight otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF To relieve the distressed, is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I 18 ENTERED APPRENTICE sincere affection To soothe the unhappy; to sympathize with their misfortunes; to compas - sionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. TRUTH Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true, is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are un - known among us; sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us; and the heart and the tongue join in promoting one another’s welfare, and rejoicing in one another’s prosperity. * * * * * THE FOUR CARDINAL VIRTUES are Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice. TEMPERANCE Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions, which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid contracting any vicious habits which would subject him to the contempt of all good Masons, as well * 4 * FORTITUDE Fortitude is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo ENTERED APPRENTICE any pam, terror or danger when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice, and should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every Mason as ~ safeguard or security against any illegali attack which may be made to extort from him any of those valuable secrets with which he has been so solemnly entrus ted and which were emblematically represented upon his first ad - mission into the Lodge. * * * * * PRUDENCE PrudenCe teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge and prudentially determine on all things relative to our pre~ent as well as our future happiness. It should be particularly attended to at all times, never to let fall the least sign, token or word, whe5eby the secrets of Masonry might be un - lawfully obtained. * * * * * JUSTICE Justice is that standard or boundary of right which enables us to render to every man his just due without distinction. This virtue is the very cement and support of civil society; and it should be the invariable practice of every good Mason never to deviate from the minutest principle thereof."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ENTERED APPRENTICE ENTERED APPRENTICE * * H OW ENTERED APPRENTICES SERVE As in former times, Entered Apprentices should serve their Masters with Freedom, Fervency and Zeal, which are represented by Chalk, Charcoal and Clay. There is nothing freer than Chalk, the slightest touch of which leaves its trace. There is nothing more fervent than Charcoal, for to it, if properly ignited, the most obdu rate metals will yield. Nothing more zealous than ‘Clay, our mother earth, which of all elements, has ever proved friendly to man. CHARGE TO THE CANDIDATE BROTHER: As you are now introduced into the first principles oI~ Freemasonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honor - able Order:— ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial; and honorable, as tending, in every particular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down, than are inculcated in the sever~d Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men, in all ages have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have aided in extending its privileges and supporting its assemblies. There are three great duties which,~’as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate: I to God, your neighbor and yourself. To God, in never mentioning His name, but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his creator; to implore His aid in all your laud - able undertakings, and to esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you. And to yourself, in avoid - ing all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties or debase the dignity oF your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the State, you are to be a quiet and peaceful subject, true to your government and just to your country; you are not to countenance dis - loyalty and rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are, on n& account, to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into argument with tbose who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Miasonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will always be as ready to give, as you will be to receive, m - struction."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ENTERED APPRENTICE Finally, keep sacred and inviolable tfre mys - teries of the Order; as these are to distinguish you from the rest oI~ the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly careful not to recommend him, unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. ADDRESS TO A NEWLY INITIATED BROTHER My Brother, I would not have you leave this Lodge room with the ?dea that any portion of the recent ceremony is unmeaning or introduced for the mere purpose of mystification. Masonry is truly a system of morality veiled in allegory, and illustrated by symbols, and the most ap - parently trivial incident, both in your preparation and initiation, has its deep and hidden meaning It is not reasonable to expect that you should at first sight penetrate the outer or allegorical symbol, but I trust you will make it your duty, as a Mason, to arrive at these hidden truths. Initiation alone never did, and never can, make a man a true Mason. It gives to you the key, and it is for you, with such assistance as amongst Masons can always be obtained by~ seeking it in the proper place, to complete the work, and ENTERED APPRENTICE 23 I sincerely trust that in this you will not be found wanting. Finally, my Brother, let me caution you that - you are to know no man as a Mason, except those you have seen in the Lodge this evening, or such persons as these brothers may vouch to be Masons."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"SECOND DEGREE Fellow Craft"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I FELLOW CRAFT CHART"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Fellow Craft Degree ~P~M6iY7iP1riW All 44M•5~ itii.tingf~l,m~a.e,p eq •1114 liii I liii I.e •u1i 1 II’\\LVhhhul iui~•I Ilili I ~ liii, I FIRST SECTION SCRIPTURE READING AMOS VII :7-8 * * * * * ~ Thus he shewed me: and behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand. u And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? hind I said, A Plumb-line.

But we as Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes. The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations before God and man, squaring our actions by the Square of Virtue, and ever remembering that we are traveling upon the Level of Time to that “Un - discovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns.’’ * * * * * SECOND SECTION There are two kinds of Masonry, Operative and Speculative. OPERATIVE MASONRY By Operative Masonry, we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, I’ whence a structure will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will resu] t a due pro - portion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of seasons. \\vINOING STAIRS I."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FELLOW CRAFT FELLOW CRAFT 33 SPECULATiVE MASONRY By Speculative Masonry, we learn to subdue our passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion, as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the con - templative to view, with reverence and admira - tion, the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfection of his Divine Creator. We work as Speculative Masons only, but our ancient brethren worked in operative as well as in speculative Masonry. They worked six days and then received their wages. They did not work on the seventh, because in six days God created the heaven and the earth, and rested upon the seventh day; the seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contemplate the glorious works of creation, and to adore their great Creator. * * * * THE BRAZEN PILLARS * * * PRACE, UNiTY AND PLENTY * * * THE GLOBES The Globes are two artificial spherical bodies, on the ccnvex surface of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other particulars. The sphere, with the parts of the earth de - lineated on its surface is called the terrestrial globe; and that with the constellations and other heavenly bodies, the celestial globe. Their principal use, besides serving as maps to distinguish the outer parts of the earth and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and explain the phenomena arising from the annual revolution of the earth around the sun, and the diurnal rotation of the earth around its own axis. Contemplating these bodies, which denote the universality of Masonry, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and his works, and are induced to encourage the study of the arts by which society has been so much benefited. * * * THE NIThIDER THRER * * * The number three alludes to the three degrees of Masonry, and also to the three principal officers of the Lodge. ) * * * THE NUMBER FIVE * * * * * The number five alludes to the five orders in architecture."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"34 FELLOW CRAFT FELLOW CRKFT 35 By order in architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrange - ment of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole: ANTIQUITY OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. ‘When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. The Doric, Ionic and Corinthian are the most ancient, and wem~e invented by the Greeks. The Tuscan and Composite were contrived by the Romans. The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the five orders. The simplicity of the con - struction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and is the best proportioned of all the orders, the several parts of which it is com - posed being founded on the natural position of solid bodies. The Ionic displays both delicacy and ingenuity in its construction, and bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and the more delicate orders. The Corinthian, the richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art, and is used in stately and superb structures. The Composite is compounded of the other orders, and is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance and beauty are displayed. Of these fiv&orders of architecture, the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian are the most revered by Masons. * * * THE FIVE SENSES The number five further alludes to the five senses of human nature, Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling and Tasting. Hearing is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and to com - municate to each other our thoughts and in - tentions. The wise Author of Nature intended that we should be social creatures, and receive a part of our knowledge from social intercourse with each other. Seeing is that sense by which we distinguish objects. By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. By it, we perceive the tempers and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"36 FELLOW CRAFT FELLOW CRAFT 37 dispositions of our fellow-creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie, the countenance will display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. The rays of light which administer to this sense, are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye clearly demon - strates this organ to be the masterpieice of nature’s work. Feeling is that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion, and ex - tension. Smelling is that sense by which we distinguish the different odors, while Tasting enables us to make a proper selection in the choice of our food. The first three, Hearing, Seeing, and Feeling, are the most revered by Masons, because * * * * THE NUMBER SEVEN * * * THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS A~ND SCIENCES The number seven alludes to the seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, which are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astro - nomy. Grammar teaches us the proper arrangement of words according to the idiom or dialect of any I particular people; and that excellency of pro - nunciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy agreeably to reason and correct usage. Rhetoric teaches us to speak fluently, not merely with propriety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance, wisely con - triving to captivate the hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat or exhort, to gdmonish or applaud. Logic teaches us to guide our reason in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries for Truth. Arithmetic teaches us the powers and proper - ties of numbers which are variously affected by letters, tables, figures and instruments. By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given for finding out any certain number, whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. Geometry treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered — from a point to a line, from a line to a surface, and from a surface to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure or an in - divisible part of space. A line is a point contin - ued, and a figure of one dimension, viz: length. A surface is a figure of two dimensions, viz: length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, viz: length, breadth and thickness. Music teaches us the art of forming concords so as to compose delightful harmony by a mathe -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I 38 FELLOW CRAFT matical arrangement of acute, grave and mixed sounds. It is the medium that gives the natural world communion with the spiritual. Astronomy is that science by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the Almighty Creator in those sacred pages, the celestial hemispheres. Of these seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, Geometry is the most revered by Masons. THE ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY By the science of Geometry the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the engineer, to mark out grounds for encampments; the geographer, to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of lands. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the duration of time and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the foundation of architecture, the root of mathe - inatics, and the basis of Masonry. * * * * THE OUTER DOOR * * * * THE INNER DOOR * * * M. C. FELLOW CRAFT 39 THIRD SECTION THE MORAL ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Free - masonry is erected. By Geometry, we may curi - ously trace Nature through her various windings, to her most concealed recesses. By it, we discover the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Grand Artificer of the universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it, we discover how the planets move in their respective orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it, we account for the return of the seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discern - ing eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed liy the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of Nature, and the observations of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the Divine plan and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many vahiable monuments of anti - quity, on which the utmost exertions of human * * * *"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"40 FELLOW CRAFT FELLOW CRAFT 41 genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, es - caped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The A~ttentive Ear receives the sound from the Instructive Tongue, and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of Faithful Breasts. Tools and i~nplements of architecture are selected by the Fraternity to imprint on the mind wise and serious truths; and thus, through a suc - cession of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired, the excellent tenets of our institution. * * * * * * G. * * T. G. A. 0. T. U. * * CHARGE TO THE CANDIDATE BROTHER: Being advanced to the second de - gree of Freemasonry, we congratulate you on your preferment. The internal, and not the external qualifications of a man are what Free - masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse. It is -unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Fellow Craft, you are bound to dis - charge, or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support; and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offences of your brethren; but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the Liberal Arts, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration; especially the science of Geometry, which is established as the basis of our art. Geometry or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a Divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the most wonderful properties of nature, it demon - strates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now con - ferred; and in your new character it is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Order, by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagement as a Fellow Craft, and to these duties you are hound by the most sacred ties."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Fr- FELLOW CRAFT ADDRESS TO A NEWLY MADE FELLOW CRAFT My Brother, as we look about this world in which we live and consider the various forms of life with which we are familiar, we find a sameness in the general plan that would be monotonousS~ if it were not so beautiful in the infinite variety of the details.

It occupied seven years in its construction, during which time we are informed that it rained not in the daytime, that the workmen might not be obstructed in their labor. ‘[his famous fabric was supported by fourteen hundred and fifty- three columns and two thousand nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. It was symbolically supported, also, by three columns — WISDOM — STRENGTH — BEAUTY — which were represented by the three Grand Masters, Solomon, King of Israel; Hiraln, King of Tyre and Hiram Abif. THE WORKMEN Entered Apprentice Lodges formerly held their meetings on the checkered pavement or ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple, where they met every evening to receive instructions relative to their work on the following day. An Entered Apprentice Lodge consisted of seven or more, one Master Mason and six Entered Apprentices. Fellow Crafts held their meetings in the Middle Chamber of .King Solomon’s Temple, where they met on the evening of the sixth day of each week"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"52 MASTER MASON MASTER MASON 53 to receive their wages. A Fellow Craft’s Lodge consisted of five or more, and when of five only, two Master Masons and three Fellow Crafts. Master Masons held their meetings in the Sanctum Sanctorum, or Hoiy of Holies, where they mel each evening to devise plans for the building of the Temple. A Master Mason’s Lodge consisted of three or more, and when of three only, three Master Masons, representing Solomon, King of Israel; Hiram, King of Tyre; and Hiram Abif. THE THREE STEPS The three steps usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, namely, Youth, Manhood and Age. In Youlh, as Entered Ap - prentices, we oughi industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as~. Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge in the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor, and ourselves; so that in Age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflections consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. NINE CLASSES OP EMBLEMS OR SYMBOLS OP MASONRY There are nine classes of Masonic emblems, eight of which are Monitorial, namely, the Pot of Incense, the Bee Hive, the Book of Constitutions, guarded by the Tyler’s Sword,the Sword pointing to a Naked Heart, the Anchor and Ark, the I- 4 Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid, and the Hour Glass and the Scythe. The ninth one is not Monitorial. THE POT OF INCENSE The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart which is always an acceptable sacrifice to Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with grati - tude to the great and beneficent Author of our existence for the manifold blessings and comforts we en~joy. THE BEEHIVE The Beehive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in Heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so should we ever be in - dustrious ones, never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are in want when it is in our power lo relieve them without inconvenience to ourselves. THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTION, GUARDED BY THE TYLER’S SWOftD The Book of Constitution, guarded by the Tyler’s Sword, reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry — ever bearing in remem - brance Ihose truly Masonic virtues, Silence and Circumspection."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"M MASTER MASON MASTER 1~1ASON 53 THE SWORD, POINTING TO A NAKED HEART The Sword, pointing to a Naked Heart, demon - strates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that ALL-SEEING EYE whom the Sun, Moon and Stars obey, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. THE ANCHOR AND ARK The Anchor and Ark are emblems of a well- grounded hope and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that Divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that Anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID The Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid was an invention of our ancient friend, the great Pyth - agoras. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, which is the foundation of Freemasonry. On th ~s subject he drew oul many problems and theorems; and among the most distinguished he erected the Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid, when, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed: “Eureka!”—in the Grecian language signifying: “I have found it.” It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. I THE HOUR GLASS The Hour Glass is an emblem of human life. How swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot without astonishment behold the little particles which are contained in this machine; and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they are all eKhausted! Thus wastes man. To - day, he puts forth the tender leaves of Hope; tomorrow, b 1 ossoms, a~nd bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. THE SCYTHE The Scythe is an emblem of Time, whkh cuts the brittle thread of lire, and launches us into eternity. Behold! what havoc the Scythe of Time makes among the human race! If by chance we should escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive at the years of manhood; yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all - devoaring Scythe of Time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us. * * * * * The Ninth Emblem is not Monilorial * * ~"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"MASTER MASON MASTER MASON LECTURE MASTER MAS~N’S DEGREE (Optional) * * * Now brethren, let us see to it, and so regulate our lives by the plumb-line of Justice, squaring our actions by the square of Virtue, that when the Grand Master of Heaven shall call for us, we may be found ready.

Membership in a Masonic Lodge can no more make you a Mason than membership in a scientific organization can make you a scientist. It is the involuntary thoughts of your heart and the voluntary acts of your life which determine your character as a man and a Mason. You can attain the highest honors the craft can bestow and be perfectly learned in all of its lore and workings and yet remain as far from being a Mason, as if you had never sought admission into the Order.

The Master of the Lodge, having received noti~e of the death of a brother, (the deceased having attained to the degree of Master Mason,) and of the request to be buried with the ceremonies of the Craft, fixes the day and hour for the funeral, (unless previously arranged by the friends or relatives of the deceased,) and issues his command to the Secretary to summon the Lodge. He may invite as many Lodges as he may think proper, and the members of those may accompany their officers in form But the whole ceremony must be under the direction of the Master of the Lodge of which the de - ceased was a member The Master should procure a short sketch of the life of the deceased, his Masonic record, and other facts that may be of interest to the Craft, and these should be given during the ceremony V Upon the death of a sojourner, the duties prescribed in Article IV will devolTe upon the Master of the Lodge within whose jurisdiction the death may occur, and if in a place where there be more than one Lodge, then upon the Master of the oldest Lodge, unless otherwise mutually arranged."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"76 FUNERAL SERVICE FUNERAL SERVICE 77 VI. Whenever civic societies, or the military, may unite with Masons in the burial of a Mason, the body of the deceased must be in charge of the Lodge having jurisdiction. The Masonic services should in all respects be conducted as f none but Masons were in attendance. VII If the deceased was a Grand or Past Grand officer, the officers of the Grand Lodge should be invited; when the Master of the Lodge having jurisdiction, will invite the Grand Officer present who has attained the highest rank to conduct the burial service. VIII The pall-bearers should be Masons, selected by the Master. LX. The proper clothing for a Masonic funeral is a black hat, black or dark clothes, black neck-tie, white gloves, and a plain square white linen or lambskin apron, with a band of black crape around the left arm, above the elbow, and a sprig of evergreen on the left breast The Warden’s columns, the Deacons’ and Stewards’ rods, the Tyler’s sword, the Bible, and the Marshal’s baton, should be trimmed with black crape, neatly tied with white ribbon The officers of the Lodge should, ‘and Past Masters and Grand Officers may, wear their official ewels X While the body is lying in the coffin, there should be placed upon the latter a plain white lambskin apron XL.

Decrepitude and decay are written upon every living thing. The cradle and the coffin stand in juxtaposition 1o each other; and it is a melancholy truth, that so soon as we begin to live, that moment also we begin to die. It is passing strange that, notwithstanding the daily mementoes of mortalily thai cross our path; we will not more seriously consider o~ir future life. We go on from design to design, add hope to hope, and lay out plans for the em - ployment of many years, until we are suddenly alarmed at the approach of the Messenger of Death, at a moment when we least expect him, and which we probably conclude to be tile meridian of our existence. What, then, are all the externals of human dignity, the power of ~wea1th, thc dreams of ambition, the pride of intellect, or the char~ns of beauty, when nature has paid her just debi? “The paths of glory lead but to the grave.” Fix your eyes on this scene, and view life stript of its ornaments, and exposed in its natural state, and you must be persuaded of the utter e~nptiness of these delusions. In death all fallacies are detected, all ranks are leveled, all distinctions are done away. The most profound problem of human life and the most pathetic cry of the human soul through - out the ages to those who do not believe in the immortality of the soul or who do not fuiiy under - stand its meaning, have been, “If a man die sball he live again, and does his spirit liVe on eter - nally?” To them physical death has been a fearful leap into the darkness and the River oI~ Death bas formed the deep and troubled waters of uncertainty and dread with the farther shore enshrouded in deepest gloom. Such travelers of earth who have journeyed down to its shadowy bank that skirts the plane of the physical life, with rare exceptions have vainly peered out into darkness across its black surface to catch one assuring ray of Light from the other side. One reason why we have been accustomed to look with so much terror on death is the dreadful gloom in which human inventions have shrouded it. The funeral emblems and ri~tes of the olden times, and of the earlier periods of the Christian Church, were exceedingly beautiful and hopeful. But for several centuries many people appear to have lost much of the deep and earnest faith of their ancestors — they have seemed to doubt whether the idea of immortality be, indeed, a verity, and, under the influence of a withering skepticism, have declared that the departed are henceForth nothing to us, and we are nothing to them. Freemasonry rebukes and repudiates such gloomy theories, so repulsive to the warm af - fections of the heart. The Lodge has no limita - tions. It reaches throughout all worlds. It em - braces the visible world of men, and the invisible world of spirits.

It would rather remove every gloomy token and plant in its place, the flowers of hope, and trust, and love. It would rend from the sculptured monuments which cover the physical body of the dead the grim and spectral images of despair, and engrave thereon the symbols of a Hope that burns snore and more brightly through the ages, and of a Love which even death cannot destroy. It would quiet the fears of its children, and bring to their hearts a calm and enduring Faith in the invisible, and an imperishable trust in the Father of the world.
