The Body of man is but the coat of skin, enveloping the sentient, thinking, acting being, who may rise or fall according to his birthright, his sur - roundings and the use he makes of his will and conscience Let us consider further the constitution of a Man, as a type of all humanity. Man is composed of Body, Soul and Spirit. The Body is formed from the Material World The Spirit of man ,is a Ray from the Divine World of God and His angels. The Soul of Man from the Ce!esiial World dwells in the body, and is illuminated by the Divine Spirit from above The Soul of Man may be considered as of two aspects, the higher Rational Soul, which gives the understanding mind, rhe intellect and the human will, and the lower or animal soul which gives the vital powers and the passions. At the death of Man, the Spirit returns unto God Who gave it, the Soul passes to the Judgment Hall for reward or punrshmenr, and the Body returns to the dust from which it was formed The ancient Philosophers spoke of a Macrocosm and of a Microcosm, these names referred to the Celestial World and to rht Soul The Macrocosm 39 --I"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"was the Created Universe, the Sun, Moon, Planets. and Siars the Microcosm was the Soul of Man, it was deemed to be influenced by the heavenly bodies, and so intimate relations between the stars and mans organs and capabilities were traced and explained Joseph, the beloved son of Jacob, dreamed, we are told, that the Sun, Moon and Stars corresponding to the Zodiacal signs appeared to him, bowing dovvn before him and bestowing their hidden influences upon the soul The Signs we call Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer.

Joseph considered these Celestial bodies as Vice- regents of the Great Supreme, Jehovah, and as he watched them pathing the Heavens in ceaseless round, he identified a harmony between them and man, and from this consideration the belief in the Planets as related to men’s character and destiny has fol - lowed.

THE LECTURE ON COLOURS During the primxval Chaos which existed before the creation of our woild, in the absence of light there was darkness and gloom, and this darkness was Blackness And God said,— Let there be Light! and there was Light I, and this was Whiteness Now this White glory of the Beginning was soon diversi - fied, the lighi being reflected in a myriad rays from the air, fire, water and earth of the material world, and Man having at the last appeared to dwell here in this world of beauty became conscious of Colours The glorious rainbow in the heavens showed him the complete series of colours at one glance, and he was soon able to distinguish seven most evident tints, which have received names in all the languages of the earrh We know them as Red, Orange, Yellow, Gieen, Blue, Indigo and Violet These colours of the rainbow are also seen by us on the earth, as well as in the heavens, we see them in our flowers, our fruits, on our hills and in our valleys, in our metals, and on the animals around us Of the seven colours of the Rainbow, there are Three which are by com - mon consent mosi clearly perceived, they are Red, Yellow and Blue, and there are some wild rrbes which can distinguish no others White is the result of a combination of all colours in due propoitron, in nature we see it most clearly on the face of the moon in a clear sky Black is the absence of Light and Colour- black objects are such as absorb all light and colours and reflect none. All nations and all religions have attributed White Light to God, 42 43"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"by whatever name He may be called, it is an emblem of Good and refers to Unity and Purity The priests and ministers of almost all faiths have been clothed in white garments in token of their high office. In the Old Testament we read of the white robes of Aaron and the sons of Levi, and the New Testa - ment refers to white garments as symbols of Christian aims and practice. White robes were worn by the priests of Isis, Osiris and Amon Ra of Ancrern Egypt, and by those who ministered ro Buddhism, or in Brahmin temples, by the Magi of Chaldea and Persia, and by the Celtic Druids The Mohammed - ans also use only white in their religious devotions. White is a symbol of the beatific combination of love, innocence and faith, which leads to purity, peace and perfection of which the Diamond is the emblem Black symbolises evil and the antithesis of all that is beautiful and true, it refers to loss, despair and death. The three primary colours Red, Yellow, and Blue have also been attributed to the Three Great Divine qualities, viz.,—Red to His Omnipotence, Yellow to His Omniscience, and Blue to His Omnipresence; or in other words to His Power, Wisdom and Univer - sality. In relation to Man the Colour Red denotes cour - age, will and force, hence to dominion and royalty, to wai and to each man’s fight with his passions. 44 Yellow refers to intellect and knowledge, and thus to wisdom; it is emblematical also of calm, peace and gladness Blue iefers to honour, love, truth, friendship and fidelity, hence to benevolence, and is so properly exhibited by the Freemasons. In the World around us we associate the Colour Red with fire, and with blood and wine and with the Ruby; Yellow with the sun’s rays, giving life to all Animal and vegetable life, and to gold, corn and oil, and wrth the Topaz, Blue with the vault of the cloudless heaven, the deep sea beneath it, and with the Sapphire These three colours again predominate in the flowers of the plants and trees of the vegetable world, and are supplemented by orange, purple and violet.

Lastly, from the ancient Egypt of the Pharaohs, ruled by mighty priest-kings, who were Initiates in the Mysteries of Isis, Osiris and Serapis Alebymy has two aspects the material and the spiritual The opinion that Alchymy was only a form of Chemistry is untenable by anyone who has read the works of its chief professors The docrrine that Alehymic writings were only religious teachings, and that its chemical references were all foolish allegories, is equally untenable in the face of history which shows that many of its most noted professors were men who had made important discoveries in the domain of chemistry, and were in no way notable as teachers either of ethics or religion Chemistry, the modern science which investigates the constirution of material substances, is the lineal descendant of Medix-val and Ancient AI-Chymy. The syllable Al is the Arabic definite arricle, meaning ‘The,” and so Alchymy was the Higher Chemistry. 56 It treati d of the essential nature of Matter, and of the Elements, of metals, of minerals, and of Tians - mutation Modern Chemistry is a science devoted chiefly to iitilitari~n and commercial uses The earliest cisc of the word “Alchymy is believed to be fond in the works of Julius ljirmicus Maternus, an Astronomer, who lived in the time of ihe Emperor Constantine The oldest Alebymic Volume known is by Zosimus of Panopohis, in Greck, and is en - titled, The Divine Art of Making Gold and Silver it was written about A 0 100 The Mdeival authors often esll Alehymy the Hermetic Art,” implying an origin from Hermes Trismegisttis of Egypt, the historic teacher, to whom was attributed the Emerald Tablet,” which has been not ineptly de - seirbed as being a r~sume of all Alehymic science on a single page.

Let us now turn to quotations from the works of eminent Alehy - mists, which illustrate their religious attitude Geber, the- Arabian, wrote—’ Our Stone has be-en described by me in a way agreeable to the Most High, the Blessed, Sublime and Glotious God, as it has been infused by the grace of His goodness, Who gives and withholds as it pleases Him.

It behooves thee to give thanks to God, Who has be- stowed liberally of His bounty to the wise, and Who 64 delivers us from Misery I am proven by the fulness of his substance and his wonders, and humbly pray that while we live we may come unto Him.’ “The Water Stone of the Wise,” an anonymous tractate ‘In the first place the practice of Alehymy enables us to understand, not merely the marvels of nature, but the nature of the Great Divine One Him - self in His unspeakable glory. Jr shadows forth in a wonderful manner how Man is an Image of a Divine Trinity; he represents the Union of Sub - stances, as well as the difference of Persons- It illustrates our purification from sin, and in brief all the Christian faith; and the reasons why Man must pass through much tribulation and anguish and fall a prey to death before he can rise again to a new and higher life All this we see in our Art as in a Mirror.’’ And then in the next sentence the treatise reverts to the practical chemical part, adding’— ‘Secondly, its earthly use consists in changing all imperfect metals, by means of a Tincture, into pure Gold, as I shall try to show.” From about the year 1650 the work of the Alehy - mists has ceased to be given to the world by printed works.
