Tire common gavel is an instrument made use of by operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the helter to fit them for the build - ei’s use; but we, as Fiee and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for tire more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds as living stones for tlrat spiritual building, “that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” SECOND SECTION PREPARATION There is much analogy between tIre prepaiation of the candidate in l\\lasoniy, and [he picpaiation for entering the Temple, as practiced among the ancient Israelites. The Talmiidical tientise, eu - titled “Beracoth,” prescribes tIre regulation in these words: “No man shall enter the Lord’s house with Iris staff (an offensive weapon), nor with Iris outer garment, iior with his shoes on his feet, not with money in his puise.” Various passages of Sciiptuie auc referied to in this section, as elucidating the traditions of Masonry on the subject of the Temple. “And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of ii on heard in the house, while it was in building.” I Kings vi. 7. “And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shall need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt caru-y it up to Jerusalem.” 2 Clii on. ii. 16. Josephus says: “The wlrole structure of the l’emple was made with great skill, of polished ritonies, and those laid together so very harmoni - olisly and smoothly, that there appeared to the ~Pcct~tors no sign of any hammer or other instru - iiuuit of architecture, but as if, without any use oh’ them, the entire mateu ials had naturally united hicinselves together, so that the agreement of one pin with another seemed rather to have been iuiiiiuial, than to have arisen from the force of ‘ohs upon them” Masonry regards no nian for his worldly wealth honors; it is therefore tIre interndh arid not the u-~dci uial qualifications which recommend a man to Masons."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"20 MANUAL OF THE LODGE ENTERED APPRENTICE’S DEGREE 21 “Now this was the manner in former time in Israel conceining redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things, a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor, and this was a testimony in IsraeL” Ruth iv. i’. In the ancient mysteries the aspirant was al - ways kept for a certain period in a condition of darkiiess. Hence darkness became the symbol - ism of initiation. Applied to Masonic symbolism, it is intended to remind the candidate of his igno - rarice, which Masonry is to enlighten; of his evil nature, which Masonry is to purify; of the world, in whose obscurity he has been wandering, and from which Masonry is to rescue him. “Ask, and it shall be given you, seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” In the ancient initiations, the candidate was never permitted on the threshold of the temple or sacred cavern, in which the ceremonies were con - ducted, until by the most solemn warning he had been impressed with the necessity of caution, secrecy, and fortitude. No man should enter upon any great or im - portant undertaking, without first invoking the blessing of Deity. ThUST IN GOD!

A Masonic Lodge is a symbol of the world.

King Solo - mon’s Temple was situated so far North of the ecliptic, that neither the sun nor moon at meridi - an could dart any rays into the northern part thereof; the North is therefore Masonically termed a place of darkness.

SITUATION OF LODGES ENTERED APPRENTICE’S DEGREE was an exact model of King Solomon’s Temple, for which reason Lodges are so situated. TO WHOM DEDICATED Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solo- noon, who was our first Most Excellent Grand Master, but modern Masons dedicate theirs to Saint John the Baptist, and Saint John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry, and since their time there is represented in every regular and well-governed Lodge, a cer - tain point within a circle, embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing those two Saints, and upon the top rest the Holy Scrip - tures, which point out the whole duty of man; the point representing an individual brother; the circle the boundary line of his duty to God and nian, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, prejudices, or interests to betray him on any occasion. In going round this circle, we Lodges are situated due East and West, that be - ing the situation of King Solomon’s Temple. Aft - er Moses had safely conducted the children of Israel through the Red Sea, into the wilderness, when pursued by Pharaoh and his host, he there, by divine command, erected a tabernacle due East and West, in order to perpetuate the re - membrance of that mighty East wind, by which their miraculous deliverance was wrought, and also to receive the rays of the rising sun.

BROTHERLY LOVE By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to regard the whole human species—the high and low, the rich and poor—as one family; who, as created by one Almighty parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who otherwise might have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particu - larly on Masons, who are linked to - gether by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the un - happy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. TRUTH Truth is a divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true, is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our con - duct; hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain-dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity.

This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess or contracting any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence of which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequently subject him to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons * * * * t.

CHARGE AT INITIATING INTO THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE BROTHER :—As you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you upon being accepted into this ancient and honor. able Order; ancient, as having existed from time immemorial; and honorable, as tending in every particular, so to render all men who will be con - formable to its precepts. No institution was ever naised on a better principle or more solid founda - tion; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best men of all ages have been promoters and encouragers of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and I)atronize their assemblies.

The performance of these duties will entitle you to public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet and peace. able citizen, true to your government and just to your country. You are not to countenance dis - loyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your other duties, for these are on no ac - count to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into argu - ment with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. During your leisure hours, that you may im - prove in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will always be as ready to give, as you will be to receive, instruc - tIoll. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mys - teries of the Order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. — - - IIIII~IUG _ HUG _______________________________________________ _______"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"111111 III II — FELLOW CRAFT’S DEGREE This degree is divided into two sections.

OPERATIVE MASONRY By operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architeciure, whence a structure will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will result a due propor - tion, and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings, and with con - venient shelters from the vicissitudes and in. clemencies of the seasons, and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary, and beneficent purposes. SPECULATIVE MASONRY By speculalive Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of ‘rood report, maintain sec~recy, and practice char - ity.

THE PILLARS OF THE PORCH “Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.” 2 Chron. iii. 15. PEACE, UNITY AND PLENTY THE GLOBES The globes are two artificial and spherical bod. ies on the convex surface of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth; the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions and other particulars. THE USE OF THE GLOBES Their principal use, besides serving as maps to distinguish the outward parts of the earth, and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and explain the phenomena arising from the annual revolution and the diurnal rotation of the earth around its own axis. They are the noblest instru - ments for improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or proposition, as well as enabling it to solve the same.

They fuLiher denote the universality of Masonry. * * * * * * * * ORDER IN ARChITECTURE By oider in architecture is meant a system of all the membeis, proportions, and ornaments ol columns and pilasteis; 01 it is a legular arrange - ment of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. ITS ANTIQUITY Fiom the first formation of society order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive sheltei from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connectcd these trees at top and bottom, me said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally pioceeded the mole improved art of architecture. The five oiders are thus classed: the Ionic, Doric, Corinthian, Tuscan, and Coin posite. Of these the ones most esteemed by Masons are the ancient and original orders which are no more than three, the Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian, -which were invented by the Greeks. To these, the Romans have added two, the Tuscan and the Composite. To the Greeks therefore, and not to the Romans, are we indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. They have a further allusion to the five senses of Human Nature, Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. Of these, the ones most esteemed by Masons are Hearing, Seeing and Feeling, for by * * * * * * * * * to the seven Liberal Arts and Sciences which are Cramma,, Rhetoric, Logic, Arrthmetrc, Geometry, Music and Astron. omy; of these the one most esteemed by Masons is Geometry, or the fifth science. GEOMETRY treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered, from a point to a line, from a line lo a superfices, from a superfices to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure, or an indivis. ible part of space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, namely, length."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"48 MANUAL OF ThE LODGE FELLOW CRAFT’S DEGREE 49 A superfices is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth, and thickness. THE ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY By this science, the architect is enabled to con - struct his plans and execute his designs; the gen - eral, to arrange his soldiers; the geographer, to give us the dimensions of the -world, and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is en - abled to make his observations, and to fix the du - ration of time and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, geometry is the foundation of architec - ture, and the root of mathematics. Astronomy also claims our attention: ASTRONOMY is that divine art by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the Almighty Creator in those sacred pages, the celestial hemi - sphere. Assisted by astronomy, we can observe the mag. nitudes, and calculate the period and eclipses of the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globes, the system of the world, and the pre - liminary laws of nature. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive un - paralleled instances of wisdom and goodness; and through the whole creatron, trace the glorious Author by his works. * * * * * * * G THE MORAL ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Masonry is erected. By geometry, we may curiously trace Nature, through her various windings, to her most concealed recesses. By it we may de~cover the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it we may discover how the planets move in their different orbits, and demonstrate their vari - ous revolutions. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Number - less worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast ex - l)anse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of Nature.

This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of igrro. rance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructrve tongue, and the secrets of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of jaitli/ul breasts. Tools and implements of architecture, and symbolic emblems most expres - sive, are selected by the Fraternity to imprint upon the mind wise and serious truths; and thus through a succession of ages, are transmitted unimpaired the most excellent tenets of our institution. 000 The leciure closes by paying profound homage to the Grand Geometrician of the Universe, before whom alt Masons, from the youngest E.
