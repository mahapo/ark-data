Brethren: You are now to quit this sacred retreat of friendship and virtue, to m~x again with I the world. Amidst its concerns and employments forget not the duties you have so frequently heard inculcated and forcibly recommended in this Lodge. Be diligent, temperate, discreet. Remember that around this altar you have promised to befriend and relieve every hrother who shall need your as - sistance. Remember that you have promised to remind him, in the most tender manner, of his f all - ings, and aid his reformation. Vindicate his char - acter, when wrongfully traduced. Suggest, in his behalf, the most candid and favorable circumstances. Is he justly reprehended? Let the world observe how Masons love ohe another. These generous principles are to extend further. Every being has a claim upon your kind offices. Do good unto all. Recommend it more “especially unto them that are of the household of faith.” By diligence in the duties of your respective callings, by liberal benevolence and diffusive char - ity, by constancy and fidelity in your friendships, discover the beneficial and happy effects of this ancient and honorable jnstitution. Let it not be supposed that you have here “la - bored in vain, and spent your strength for naught; your work is with the Lord, and your recom - pense with your God.” Finally, brethren, be ye all of one mind; live in peace; and may the God of love and peace delight to dweU with and bless you."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"w. stichtingai’gi v~ lit w.stichtingargu~ iii w.stichtingargus.ii I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n1~ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 rw.stichti ngargus.nl tw. stichtingargus.nl tw.stichtingargus.nl tw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl rW. stichtingargus.nl tw.stichtingargus.nl IW. stichtingargus.nl iw.sticht ingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl /w.stichtingarguS.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl lw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~rw.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl YW.

My friend(s) bear in mind that there is nothing in a Masonic initiation which does not have a serious purpose. Nothing will be done to embarrass you, or trifle with your feelings. Your preparation has a meaning which will be explained later. With this preliminary statement, let me express the hope that your mind will be at ease and in a mood to receive the important lessons which Masonry is intended to teach. Before you are prepared you will first give your unequivocal assent to these questions. 12. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, before these gentlemen, that, unbiased by friends, and uninfluenced by mercenary motives, you freely and voluntarily offer yoursell a candidate for the mysteries of Masonry? 13. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, before these gentlemen, that you are prompted to solicit the privileges of Masonry by a favorable opinion conceived of the Institution, a desire for TREsTLE-HOARD. 7 knowledge, and a sincere wisja to be serviceable to your fellow creatures? 14. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, before these gentlemen, that you will cheerfully conform with all the ancient established usages and customs of the Craft? F]RST SECTION.

THE TWENTY—FOUR INCH GAUGE is an m - etrument made use of by operative Masons to measure and lay out their work. But we, as free and accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divid - ing our time. It being divided into twenty-four equal parts is emblematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three parts, whereby we find a part for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother; a part for our usual avocations; and a part for refresh - ment and sleep. 19. THE COMMON GAVEL is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to break off the rough TRESTLE-HOARD 9 and superfluous parts of stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, as free and ac - cepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and super - fluities of life, thereby fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

THIRD SECTION. The third and last section of this degree is perhaps the most interesting and instructive of the three.

A Lodge is a certain number of Masons duly assembled and legally constituted, having the Holy Bible, the Square and the Compasses, and a Warrant or Charter empowerine them to work. Our ancient brethren usually met on high hills, or in low vales, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, ascending and de - scending. ~22. The FORM Of a Lodge is an oblong; from East to West, between the North and the South; from the earth to the heavens, and from the surface of the earth to the centre thereof. It is said to be of these vast dimensions to denote the univer&ality of Masonry, and that a Mason ‘s-charity should be equally extensive 23. A Lodge is metaphorically said to be SUP - PORTED by three great pillars, called Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty; because it is necessary that there should be Wisdom to contrive, Strength to support, and Beauty to adorn all great and impor - tant undertakings. They are represented by the first three officers of the Lodge, via.: the Worshipful Master, the Senior Warden, and the Junior Warden. The Worshipful Master is said to represent the pillar Wisdom, it being presumed that he has wisdom to rule and govern the Lodge over which he is appointed TRESTLE-HOARD. 11 to preside; the Senior Warden is said ~o repre - sent the pillar Strength, it being his duty to assist the Worshipful Master in opening and in closing’. his Lodge; and the Junior Warden is said to i~epre- sent the pillar Beauty, it being his duty to observe the sun at high meridian, which is the glory and beauty of the day. 24. The. COVERING of a Lodge is no less than the clouded canopy of heaven, whither all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by aid of the theolog - ical ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw reach - ing from earth to heaven,—the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity; teaching Faith in God, Hope in immortal - ity, and Charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity; for our Faith may be lost in sight; Hope ends in fruition; but Charity extends beyond the grave, to the boundless realms of eternity. 25. Every well-governed Lodge is FURNISHED with the Holy Bible, the Square~, and the Compasses, which are dedicated to God, the Master, and the Craft The Bible is dedicated to the service of God, it being the inestimable gift of God to man, and on it we obligate a newly admitted brother; the Square to the Master, it being the proper Masonic emblem of his office, and continually reminding him of the duty he owes to the Lodge over which he is appointed to preside; and the Compasses to the Craft, because, by a due attention to their use, we are taught to regulate our desires, and to keep our I."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargllft hi w.stichtingargux,uI w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nlL w.stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichti ngargus.nl rw. stichti ngargus.nl rw. stichti ngargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl Tw.stichtingargus .nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichting&gus.nl 1W .stichting&gus.nl rw.stichtingargus .nl rw.stichtingargus.nl tw. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl ,w.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl jw.stichtingargus.nl iw.suchtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.

The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the In - dented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border, or skirting, which surrounded it,—with the Blazing Star in the centre. The Mosaic Pavement is em - blematic of human life, checkered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel which surrounds it, of those manifold blessings and comforts which sur - round us, and which we hope to obtain by a f~ith - ful reliance on Divine Providence, which is h~ero - 4 glyphically represented by the Blazing Star in.’ the centre. ~< S 27. We have three LIGHTS in the Lodge, situated in the South, the West, and the East~ we have’ none in the North, because King Solomon’s Temple was situated so far North of the ecliptic that neither the sun nor the moon at its meridian height could dart any rays of light into the North side thereof; the North is therefore Masonically ternkd a place of darkness. 28. We have six JEWELS in the Lodge, three mi- movable and three movable. The immovable jew - els are the Square, the Level, and the Plumb; the Square teaches morabty, the Level equality, and ‘1 tRESTLE -BOARD. is the Plumb rectitude of life. The three movable jewels are the Rough Ashler, the Perfect Ashler, and the Trestle-Board. The Rough Ashler is a stone es taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashler is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to he adjusted by the working-tools of the Fellow-craft. The Trestle-Board is for the Master to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashler we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect AshIer, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive, by a virtuous education, our Own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle-Board we are also reminded that, as the operativ& workman erects jhis temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle-Board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and de - signs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great book of nature and revela - tion, which is our spiritual, moral, and Masonic Tr~stle-Board. 29. Lodges are SIT QATED due East and West for sevcral reasons: First, because the sun rises in the East and sets in the West; secondly, because all arts and sciences, as well as Masonry, arose in the East and spread to the West; and thirdly, be~ cau9e this was the - situation of King Solomon’s"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"w.stichting~rgi i~. iii w.stichtingargtui. iii w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl rw. stichti ngargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl Tw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl tw. stichtingargus.nl ~xv. stichtingargus.nl W .stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl /W. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl 14 TRESTLE—HOARD. Temple. King SoVomon’s Temple was so situated, because after Moses had safely conducted the children of Israel through the Red Sea when pur - sued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he there by divine command erected a tabernacle which was situated due East and West 1 to perpetuate a remembrance of that miraculous East wind by which their happy deliverance was wrought; also to receive the firsl rays of the rising sun. This tahernacle was an exact model for King Solomon’s Temple, since the time of which all Lodges have heen so situated. 30. Masons in ancient times DEDICATED their Lodges to King Solomon, he being their first and most excellent~ Grand Master; Masons in modern time, proress~ng Christianity, dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangel - ist, two eminei~’t Christian Patrons of Freema - sonry; and since their time, there has been repre - sented, in every regular and well-furnished Lodge, a certain Point within a Circle, einbordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing St John the Baptist and St. John the EvangelisV. Upon the top of the Circle rests the Book of Masonic Con - stitutions. The Point represents an individual brother; the Circle the boundary line of his duty. In going around this Circle, we necessarily touch on the two parallel lines, as well as on the Book of Constitutio~s; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscrihed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err. TRESTLE—BOARD. 15 S/j 31. THE PRINCIPAL POINT OF FREE MASONRY is three-fold, and comprises the exalted virtues of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth—which are the tenets of a Mason’s profession. They are ~hua explained: 32. By the exercise of Br4herly Love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family,—the high and low, rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support~ and protect each other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conci1ia~ea true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance~. 88 To relieve the distressed is a duty incum - bent on all men; but particularly on Masons, who profess to be linked together hy an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compas - sionate their miseries, and to restore peace to Vheir troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On th[s basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. 84. TRUTH 1S a divine attribute, and the founda - tion of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"K- w. stichtingar~~ INn) w. stichtingarguH. id w. stichtingargus,n I w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl TW. stichtingargus.nl Tw.stichtingargus.nl TW. stichtingargus.nl Tw.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rW. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl 16 TRESTLE—BOARD. us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. To this explanation of tke above principles succeeds an illustration of the four cardinal virtues,—Tem - perance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice. 35. TEMPERANCE iS that due restraint upon our affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or the contracting of any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence in which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequently subject him to the 36. FORTITUDE is that noble and steady purpose of the mind, whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril or danger, when prudentially deemed ezpedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice; and, like the former. should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every Mason, as a safeguard or sec~Irity against any ille - gal attack that may be made, by force or other - wise, to extort from him any of those valuable secrets with which he has been so solemnly in- trusted, and which was emblematically repr~scnted upon his first admission into the Lodge; —— — 17 TRESTLE—BOARD. I 1 2 ~ 37. PRUDENCE teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge, and prudentially determine, on all things relative to our present as well as to our future happiness. This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, word or token, whereby the secrets of the Craft may be unlawfully obtained:— 38. JUSTICE is that standard, or boundary of right, which enables us to render to every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; sad, as justice in a great measure constitutes the real good man, so should, it be the practice of every Mason ncver to deviate from the minutest principles thereof; —— 39.

CHARGE AT INITIATION. 40. My Brother: Having passed through the ceremonies of initiation, allow me to congratulate you on your admission into our ancient and hon - orable Society,—ancient, as having existed from time immemorial; honorable, as tending to make men so, who are strictly obedient to its precepts. It is an Institution having for its foundation the practice of the social and moral virtues. And to so high an eminence has its credit been advanced that, in every age and country, men pre-eminent for their moral and intellectual attainments have en~ ‘4; uraged and promoted its interests. Nor has it $ - been thought derogatory to their dignity that Mon - archs have, for a season, exchanged the sceptre for the trowel, to patronize our mysteries, and join in our assemblies. As a Mason you are to regard the volume of the sacred’ law as the great light of your profession; to consider it as the unerring standard of truth and justice, and to regulate your actions by the divine precepts it contains. In it you will learn the~ im - portant duties you owe to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, by never mentioning his name but with that awe and reverence Which are due TRESvLE—BO ARD. from the creature to his Creator; by imploring his aid in all your lawful undertakings, and by looking up to Him, in every emergency, for comfort and support. To your neighbor, by acting with him upon the square; by rendering him every kind office which justice or mercy may require; by re - lieving his distresses and soothing his afflictions; and by doing unto him as, in similar cases, you would that he should do unto you. And to your - self, by such a prudent and ~eII-regulated course of discipline as may best conduce to the preserva - tion of your corporal and mental faculties in their fullest energy; thereby enabling you to exert the talents wherewith God has blessed you, as well to his glory as to the welfare of your fellow-creatures. As a Citizen, you are cnjoined to be exemplary in the discharge of your civil duties, by never proposing. or countenancing, any act which may have a tendency to subvert the peace and good order of society; by paying due obedience to the laws under whose protection you live, and by never losing sight of the allegiance due to your country. As an Individual, you are charged to practice the domestic virtues. Let Temperance chasten, Fortitude support, Prudence direct you, and Jus - tice be the guide of all your actions. Be especially careful to maintain, in their fullest splendor, those truly Masonic ornaments, Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. 4"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"w.stichtingarguN. iii w. stichtingargus. id w. stichti ngargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichti ngargus.nl rw. stichti ngargus.nl Tw.stichtingargus.nl TW. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rW. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl 20 r TRESTLE—BOARD.

And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, iI~ profiteth me nothing.

The PLUMB, SQUARE, AND LEVEL, are implements peculiar to this degree. 43. The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative Masons to try perpendiculars; the Square, to square their work; a~ad the Level, to prove horizontals; but we, as free and accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes. The Plumb admon - ishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations before God and man, squaring our actions by the square of virtue, and ever remembering that we are travehng upon the level of time to “that undis - covered country from whose bourne no traveler returns.” SECOND SECTION. 44. Freemasonry is a progressive moral science, and is considered under two denominations, oper - ative and speculative. By OPERATIVE MASONRY, we allude to a proper apphcation of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will de - rive figure, strength, and beauty, - and from which will result a due proportion and just correspond- 1” -i ii TRESTLE—BOARD. ence in all its parts. It\\furiiishes us with dwell - ings and convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it dis - plays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arraingement of the sundry mate - rials of which the edifice is composed, it demon - strates that a fund of ~bience and industry is im - planted in man for the best, most salutary, and beneficent purposes. 45. By SPECULATIVE MASONRY we learn to sub - due the passions, to act upon the square, to keep a tongue of good report, to maintain secrecy, and to practice charity. It is so interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contempla - tive to view with reverence and admiration the glori - ous works of the creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections ~f his divine Creator. 46.

At the building of King Solomon’s Temple, Fellow Craft were received and recorded as such in the Middle Chamber. In gaining their way thither, they passed through a porch supported by two brazen pillars, the one upon the left hand and the other upon the right. The one upon the right hand was called Jachin; the one upon the left Boaz. The one upon the left hand denotes strength, the one upon the right to establish; they together allude to God’s promise to David, that “in strength will I establish this my house forever.” These pillars were thirty and five cebits high, and were domed with ehapiters of five cubits each, making all forty cubits in height They were ornamented in ith lily-work, net-work, and pomegranates, em - lematical of- peace, umty, and plenty. The lily, from its purity and the remote situation in which it grows, denotes Peace; the net-work, from the in - timate connection of its several parts, denotes Unity; and the pomegranate, from the exuberance of its seed, denotes Plenty. These pillars were further adorned by a pommel or ball upon the top of each, representing the GLOBES, celestial and terres - trial, on the con vex surfaces of which are repre - sented the countries, seas, and various parts of th~ earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolif - tions, and other particulars TREsTLE—BOARD. -Their principal use, besides serving as maps to distinguish the outward parts of the earth, and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and ex - plain the phenomena arising from the annual revo - lution; and diurnal rotation of the earth round its own axis. They are valuable instruments for improving the mind and giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or proposition, as well as en - abling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and his works, and are induced to en - courage the studies of astrenomy, geography, navi - gation, and the arts dependent on them, by which society has been so much benefited. They denote the universabty of Freemasonry. These pillars were hollow, the better to serve as safe repositories for the Archives of Masonry against inundation and conflagration, and were cast in the clay ground of Jordan, between Siiccoth and Zere - datha, where all the holy vessels for King Solomon’s Temple were cast by Hiram Abiff, a widow’s son, of the tribe of NTaphtali. 48. Passing through this porch we come to a flight of Winding Stairs, consisting of three, five, and seven steps.

The five step~,~allude to the five orders in Architecture. By oaDER,’=i ARcmTEcTXiRE is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regu - lar an~angement~of the projecting parts of a build - ing, which, united with those of a column, form a ‘1 beautiful, perfect, and complete whole From the first formation of society, order in ar - chitecture may be traced. When the rigor of the seasons first obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally pro - ceeded the more improved art of architecture. 50. The five orders are thus classed: the Tuscan, the Doric, the Ionic, the Corinthian, and the Com - posite. 51. The TUSCAN is the most simple and solid of the five orders It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. 52. TEE Donic, which is plain and natural, is he most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. K column is eight diameters high, and has seldom Its TRESTLE—BOARD. 27 any ornaments on base or capital, except mouldings, though the frieze is distinguished by trigl~pbs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the ornaments of - the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and noble simplicity are chiefly required. 53. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is com - posed are founded on the natural position of’ solid bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state. In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric; for ‘when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form the name of Tuscan was conferred • upon it. Hence, the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in, its original state. • 54. TEE IoNic bears a kind of mean proportion, between the more solid and the more delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentils, There are both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the Ionians, as the famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young woman, of an elegant shape dressed in her hair; in contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"w.stichtingar~pi~ iii w.stichtingarguH. iii w.stichtingargu&flI w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus .nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl t ’w. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.iil 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rw.sticht ingargus.nl ~2S ~// 4 TREsTLE—BOARD. 55. The CoiiimmynxAN, the richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves, and eight vohutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with den tils and mo - dillions. This order is used in stately and superb struct - ures. It was invented at Corinth, by Callimachus, who is said to have taken the hint of the pillar from the following remarkable circumstance: Ac - cidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys, covered with a tile, placed over an acanthus root,—it having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up they ecinpassed the basket till, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction, and bent downwards Calhmachus, struck with the object, set about imi - tating the figure. The vase of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus, the tile, and the volutes, the bending leaves. 56. TEE CoMi’ossm is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corin - thian, an&the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has the quarter-round, as in the Tuscan and Done orders; is ten diameters high; and its cornice has dentils, and simple modilhions. This pillar is gen - erally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. v’w.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ~i-w.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.fll vw. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.fll vw.sti chtingargus.nl TRESTLE—BOARD. 29 57. The ancient and original orders of architec - ture, esteemed by Masons, are no more than three —the Doric, the Jonic~ and the Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks To these the Ro - mans have added two—the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Done, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corin - thian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore,and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in archi~ tecture. ~ 58. The five steps further allude to the five senses of human nature, namely: Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. 59. HEARIAG is that sense by which we distin - guish sounds, and are capable of appreciating the agreeable charms of music.

SEEiNO is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and, in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety as displayed in the landscape of nature. By this sense, we find our way on the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, deter - mine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more; by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections, of our fellow creatures when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance will display the hypocrisy to the dis - cerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which ad - minister to this sense are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. 4he structure of the eye and its appurtenances evinces the admirable contrivance of nature for performing all its various eicternal and internal motions; while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals suited to their several ways of life, clearly demon - strates this organ to be the masterpiece of nature’s works. 61. FEELiNO is that sense by which we dis - tinguish the different qualities of bodies; such as ~¾-C r TRESTLE -BoA~D~ heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion, and ex - tension. 62. These three senses—Hearing Seeing, and Peeling~are deemed peculiarly essential to Masons: for by the sense of IRearmg we hear the word; by that of Seeing we perceive the sign; and by that of Feeling we receive the grip or token, whereby one brother may know another in the dark as well as in the light. 63 SMELLiNO is that sense by which we dis - tinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind Animal and vegetable bodies, and indeed - most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth efiluvia of vast subtility, as well in the state of bfe and growth as in the state of fermentation and ~ntrefaction These effluvia, being drawn into ~ostrils along with the air, are the means by ii all bodies are smelled. Hence, it is evident ~ there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in respiration. 64. TASTING enables us to make proper distinc - tion in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration.

The Seven Steps allude to the Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, which are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astron - omy. 66- GRAMMAR is the key by which alone a door can be opened to the understanding of speech. It is Grammar which reveals the admirable art of language and unfolds its various constituent parts, its names, definitions, and respective offices; it un - ravels, as it were, the thread of which the web of speech is composed. These reflections seldom oc - cur to anyone before their acquaintance with the art; yet it is most certain that without a knowl - edge of Grammar, it is very difficult to speak with propriety, precision, and purity. 67. It is by RHETORic that the art of speaking eloquently is acquired. To be an eloquent speaker, 4’ r TRESTLE—BOARD. 33 in the proper sense of the word, is far from being either a common or an easy attainment. it is the art of being persuasive and commanding; the art not only of pleasing the fancy, but of speaking both to the understanding and to the heart. 65. Loaic is that science which directs us how to form clear and distinct ideas of things, and thereby prevents us from being misled by their similitude or resemblance. Of all the human sci - ences, that concerning man’s mind is certainly most worthy of man The precise business of Logic is to explain the nature of the human mind, and th~ proper manner of conducting its several powers in the attainment of truth and knowledge. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation or groundwork of our inquiries: particularly in the pursuit of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons. 69. ARITHMETIC is the art of numbering, or that part of the mathematics which considers the properties of numbers in general. We have but a very imperfect idea of things, without quantity, and as imperfect of quantity of itself, without the help of Arithmetic. All the works of the Almighty are made in number, weight, and measure; there - fore, to understand them rightly, we ought to un - derstand arithmetical calculations; and the greater advancement we make in the mathematical sci - ences the more capable we shall be of considering"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"w.stichtingal’guM.td w.stichtingarguN. iii w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl TW. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W .sticht ingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 iw.stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl 34 TRESTLE-BOARD, such things as are the ordinary objects of our con - ceptions, and be thereby led to a more com~irehen• sive knowledge of our great Creator, and the works of the creation. 70. GEOMETRY, or the fifth science, is the most revered by Masons. It treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered,—from a point to a line, from a line to a superfice, and from a superfice to a solid. A point is the beginning of all Geometrical mat - ter, or an indivisible part of space. A line is a point continued, or a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superfice is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth. and thickness, which form a cube and comprehend the whole. By this science the architect is enabled to con - struct his plans and execute his designs; the gen - eral, to arrange his soldiers; the engineer, to mark out grounds for encampments; the geographer, to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of • the seas, and specify the divisions of empires, king - doms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations of tim~s and seasons, years, and cycles. In fine, Geometry is TRESTLE—BOA RD. 35 the foundation of architecture, and the root of mathematics. 71. Music is that elevated science which affects the passions by sound. There are few who have not felt its charms, and acknowledged its expres - sions to be intelligible to the heart. It is a lan - guage of delightful sensations far more elegant than words; it breathes to the ear the clearest intima - tions; it touches and gently agitates the agreeable and sublime passions; it wraps us in melancholy, and elevates us in joy; it dissolves and inflames; it melts us in tenderness, and excites us to war. This science is truly congenial to the nature of man; for by its powerful charms the most discordant passions may be harmonized and brought into per - feet unison; but it never sounds with such seraphic harmony as when employed in singing hymns of gratitude to the Creator of the universe. 72 ASTRONOMY iS that sublime science which inspires the contemplative mind to soar aloft and read the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the great Creator in the heavens. flow nobly eloquent of the Deity is the celestial hemisphere,—spangled with the most magnificent heralds of His infinite glory They speak to the whole universe; for there is neither speech so barbarous but their lan - guage is understood, nor nation so distant but their voices are heard anfongat them.

Assisted by Astronomy, we ascertain the laws which govern the heavenly bodies, and by which their motions are directed; investigate the power by which they circulate in their orbits, discover their size, determine their distance; explain their various phenomena, and correct the fallacy of the senses by the light of truth. OF THE MORAL ADvANTAGEs OF GEOMETRY. 73. GEOMETRY, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Free - masonry is erected. By Geometry, we may curi - ously trace nature through her various windings to her most concealed recesses. By it we discover the power, wisdom, and goodness of the great Artificer of the universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their respective orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of the seasons and the variety of changes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature A survey of nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imi - tate the divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to N r I TRESTLE—BOAR]). 37 every useful art. The architect began to design; and the plans which he laid down, being improved by time and experience, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spa - cious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing rav - ages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwith - standing, bas still survived. The attentive ear re - ceives the sound from the instructive tonQue, and the mysteries of Masonry are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. Tools and imple - ments of architecture, most expressive, are selected by the Fraternity to imprint on the memory wise and serious truths; and thus through a succession of ages are transmitted unimpaired the most excel - lent tenets of our Institution. cHARGE AT PASSING. 74.

It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Fellow Craft, you are bound to discharge. Your general good reputation affords satisfactory assurance that you will not suffer any consideration to induce you to act in any manner unworthy of the respectable character you now sustain; but, on the contrary, that you will ever display the discretion the virtue, and the dignity which becomes a worthy 2 and exemplary Mason. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support; and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offences of your brethren; but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The impressive lessons of this degree are calcu - lated to inculcate upon the mind of the novitiate the importance of the study of the liberal arts and sciences,—especially of the noble science of Geom - etry, which forms the basis of Freemasonry; and which, being of a divine and moral nature, is en - riched with the most useful knowledge; for while it proves the wonderful properties of nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. To the study of Geometry, therefore, your attention is especially directed. Your past regular deportment and upright con - duct have merited the honor we have conferred In your present character it is expected that at all p. TRESTLE—BOARD. our assemblies you will observe the solemnities of our ceremonies, that you will preserve the ancient usages and customs of the Fraternity sacred and inviolate, and thus, by your example, induce others to hold them in due veneration.

This section illustrates certain hieroglyphical em - blems, and inculcates many useful and impressive moral lessons. It aiso detm2s many particulars t~elative to the building of the TempLe at Jerusalem. — Which magnificent structure was founded in the fourth year of the reign of King Solomon, on the second day of the montb Zif, which is the sec - ond month of the sacred year It was located on Mount Moriah, near the place where Abraham was about to offer up his eon Tsaac, and where David met and appeased the destroying angel. Josephus informs us that, although more than seven years were occupied in building it, yet, during the whole term, it did not rain in the daytime, that the work- TRESTRE-HOARD. 45 men might not be obstructed in their labor. From sacred history we also learn that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard in the house while it was in building. It is metaphorically said to have been supported by three great pillars denominated Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty. They are represented by our three Ancient Grand Masters—Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff. Solomon, King of Israel, is said to have repre - sented Wisdom, as it was his wisdom that con - trived the mighty fabric which immortalized his name. Hiram, King of Tyre, is said to have repre - sented Strength, for by his counsels he strength - ened the hands of King Solomon in his noble and glorious undertakings; and Hiram AbuT is said to have represented Beauty, for by his cunning con - trivance and curious workmanship the Temple was beautified and adorned. It is further said to have been supported by four - teen hundred and fifty-three columns, and two thousand nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest parian marble. There were em - ployed in its building, three Grand Masters; three thousand and three hundred Masters, or overseers of the work; eighty thousand Fellow Craft, or hewers in the mountains; and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices, or bearers of burden.

In front of the magnificent porch were placed the two celebrated pillars, Boaz and Jachin, one on the left, and one on the right. They are supposed to have been placed there as a memorial to the children of Israel of the happy deliverance of their forefathers from Egyptian bondage, and in com - memoration of the miraculous pillars of fire and cloud. The pillar of fire gave light to the Israel - ites, and facilitated their march, and the cloud proved darkness to Pharaoh and his host, and re - tarded their pursuit. King Solomon, therefore, ordered these pillars to be placed at the entrance of the Temple, as the most conspicuous part, that the children of Israel might have the happy event continually before their eyes, in going to and returning from divine worship. ~ Si. There are two classes of Emblems attached to this degree, the first of which consists of the Three Steps, the Pot of Incense, the Bee-Hive, the Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s Sword the Sword pointing to the Naked Heart, the All-Seciug Eye, the Anchor and Ark, the Forty- Seventh Problem of Euclid, the Hour Glass, and Scythe. 82. THE THREE STEPS usually delineated upon the Master’s Carpet, are emblematical of the three TREsTLE—BOARD. 47 principal stages of human life, viz.: youth, man - hood, and age. In youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the p attainment of useful knowledge; in manhood, as Fellow Craft, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to God, our eighhor, and ourselves; that so, in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflection con - sequent on a well spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. 83. THE POT OF INCENSE lS an emblem of a pure beart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent Author of our existence for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. 84. THE BEE-HIVE is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven, to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that, as we came into the world rational and in - telligent beings, so we should ever he industrious ones; never sitting down contented, while our fellow-creatures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them, without inconvenience to ourselves.

Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so de - mean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our pro - tection as Masons. 85. THE BooK OP CONSTITUTIONS GUARDED BY THE TYLER’S SWORD, reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words, and actions, particularly when before the uninitiated; ever bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and circum - ~pection. 86 THE Sworw POINTING TO ¶I~HE NAKED REART, demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words, and actions, may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet the ALL-SEEING Evie, -whom the Sun, Moon, and Stars obey, and under who~e watchful TRESTLE—BOARD. 49 care even comets perform their stupendous revo - lutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. 87.

They are emblematical of that divine ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. ,. 88. THE FORT F—SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID was an invention of the ancient philosopher, the great Pythagoras, who in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several or - ders of Priesthood, and is said to have been raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantl~r in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most distinguished, he erected this, when, in tho joy of his heart, he exclaimed Eureka, signifying in the Grecian language, I have found it; and upon tb~ discovery of which, he is said to have saciificed a hecatomb. ft teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. 89.

Thus wastes man; to-day he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost, which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. 90. THE SCYTHE is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of hfe, and launches us into eternity. Behold what havoc the scythe of time -makes among the human race; if by chance we should escape the numerous evils incident to child - hood and youth, and, with health and vigor, arrive to the years of manhood, yet withal we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring Scythe of time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us. 91.

CHARGE AT THE HAISING. 93. My Brother:—Your zeal for our Institution, the progress you have made in our mysteries, and your steady conformity to our useful regulations, have pointed you out as a proper object for this peculiar mark of our favor.

To your inferiors in rank or office you are to recommend obedience and submission; to your equals, courtesy and affability; to your superiors, kindness and condescension Universal benevo - lence you are zealously to inculcate: and by the regularity of your own conduct, endeavor to remove every aspersion against this venerable Institution. Our ancient landmarks you are carefully to preserve, and not to suffer them, on any pretence, to be in - fringed, or countenance a deviation from our estab - lished customs. Your honor and reputation are concerned in sup - porting with dignity the respectable character you now bear. Let no motive, therefore, make you swerve from your duty, violate your vows, or be - tray your trust; but be true and faithful, and mu- tate the example of that celebrated artist whom you have this day represented. Thus you will render yourself deserving of the honor which we have conferred, and worthy of the confidence we have reposed in you. In place of the above charge it is permissvble to use such other suitable charge as the Master may desire. ‘I"}]
