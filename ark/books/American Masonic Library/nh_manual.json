OF ITS ANTIQUITY. From the first formation of society order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons first obliged men to contiive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to stipport a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and cap - ital of pillais ; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The Orders in Architect - ure are thtis classed the TUSCAN, Doitic, IONIC, CORINTH IAN, and CoMPosITE."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"34 MANUAL. MANUAL. 35 The ancient and original orders in archi - tecture esteemetl by Masons are no more than three—the Done, Ionic, and Corinth - ian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have addetl two— the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Done ; and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The flu st three orders alone, howevet, show invention and partic - ular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only aeci - tientally. The Tuscan is the Done in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Cor - inthian enriched with the Ionic’. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in architecture. THE FIVE SENSES. HEARING, SEEING, FEELING, SMELLING, AND TASTING. The first three, Hearing, Seeing, and Feel - ing, are deemed most essential among Ma - sons; . . THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES. GRAMMAR, RHETORIC, LOGIC, ARITHMETIC, GEOMETRY, MUSIC, AND ASTRONOMY. Geometry treats of the powers and prop - erties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are eonsidered,—froun a taint to a line, from a line to a suterfice, antl from a superfice to a solid. A taint is a dimensionless figure ; or an indivisible part of space. THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHI - T ECTURE mm"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MANUAL. MANUAL. 37 A line is a point continued, or a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superfice is a fignie of two thimensions, —length anti breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, p —length, breadth, and thickness. THE ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY By this science, the architect is enabled to constiuct his plans anti execute his tiesigus the general to arrange his soldiei s the en - gineer to mark otit grounds for encamp - ments; the geographer to give us the di - mensions of the world anti all things thei cm containecl,—to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, king - doms, and piovinees. By it, also, the astron - oiner is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the foundation of aichiteeture, and the root of the mathenmties. * * * * * * ITS iviORAL ADVANTAGES. Geometry, the first and nobiest of sciences, and the basis on which the superstructure of Fi-eemasonry is erected. By Geometiy, we may curiotisly trace Nature through her various windings to her most concealed iecesses. By it we discover the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the Grand Aitificer of the Universe, and view with tiehight the proportions which con - nect this vast machine. By it we discover how the planets move in their respective orbits, and demonstiate their various revolu - tions. By it we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each se~ison displays to the discerning eye. j ~- ~ — 71~~~~~~~"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"38 MANUAL. MANUAL. 39 Numberless worlds are arotind us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all eon - dtieted by the same unerring law of Nature. A survey of Nature, and the observation of hei beatitiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the divine plan, and sttidy symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and biith to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of avery age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laiti waste and destroyed many valuable inon - uments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been em - ployed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spaciodis anti magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still sot - vived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the sacred mysteries are safely lodged in the repositoiy of faithful breasts. Tools and implements of architecture—symbols the most expressive —are selected by the Fraternity to imprint on the memory wise and serious truths ; and thus throtigh a succession of ages are trans - m itteti unimpaired the excellent tenets of our Institution.
