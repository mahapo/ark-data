The greatest of these is charity; for our faith may be lost in sight, hope ends in fruition; but charity extends beyond the grave, through the bound - less realms of eternity. ~0~ The furniture of a lodge is the Holy Bible, Square, and Compass.

They are situated in the East, West, and South. There is none in the North because of the situation of King Solomon’s Temple, it being situated so far north of the ecliptic that the Sun or Moon, at their meridian height, could dart no rays into the north part thereof. The North, therefore, we Masonically term a place of darkness. A lodge has six jewels, three immovable and three movable. The immovable jewels are the Square, Level, and Plumb *** ~l~ I’l’ I;, The ornaments of a lodge are the Mosaic pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple, the Indented Tessel, that beautiful tesselated border, or skirting, which surround it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematic of human life, checkered with good and evil. The beautiful border which surrounds it, those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us; and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence which is hieroglyphical - ly represented by the Blazing Star in the cen - ter. The Square teaches morality; the Level, equality; and the Plumb, rectitude of life. The movable jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"20 MONITOR THE ENTERED APPRENTICE MASON 21 [ F The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state; the Per - fect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman to be adjusted by the tools of the fellow craft; the Trestle Board is for the master workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar, we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive, by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle Board, we are reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal build - ing agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his trestle board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeable to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the great books of nature and revelation, which are our spiritual, moral, and Masonic trestle board. A lodge should be situated due East and West, because that was the situation of King Solomon’s Temple *** In ancient times, lodges were dedicated to Solomon, King of Israel, because he was our first N4ost Excellent Grand Master. Masons professing Christianity, dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry; and, since their time, there is represented in every regular and well governed lodge, a cer - tain Point within a Circle; the Point repre - senting an individual brother, the Circle representing the boundary line of his duty to God and man, beyond which he is never to suf - fer his passions, prejudices, or interests to betray him on any occasion. This Circle is embordered by two perpen - dicular parallel lines, representing St. John the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"22 MONITOR THE ENTERED APPRENTICE MASON 23 Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were perfect parallels in Christianity as well as Masonry; and, upon the vertex, rests the Book of Holy Scriptures, which points out the whole duty of man. In going round this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures; and, while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially err. The three great tenets of Masonic profes - sion are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. Brotherly Love By the exercise of brotherly love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family, the high and low, the rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, sup - port, and protect each other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. Relief To relieve the distressed is a duty incum - bent on all men; but, particularly, on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhap-~ py, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis, we form our friendships and establish our connections. Truth Truth is a divine attribute, and the founda - tion of every Virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme, we contemplate, and by its dictates, en - deavor to regulate our conduct; hence, while in - fluenced by this principle, hypocricy and deceit are unknown among us. Sincerity and plain dealing distiguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. **** and allude to the four cardinal vir - tues, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice, and are thus explained: Temperance Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions, which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the all urements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason; as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or contract - ing any licentious or vicious habit, the indul - gence of which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequently subject him to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons Fortitude Fortitude is that noble and steady purpose of the mind, whereby we are enabled to under-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"24 MONITOR THE ENTERED APPRENTICE MASON 25 go any pain, peril, or danger, when prudential - ly deemed expedient. This virtue is equally dis - tant from rashness and cowardice; and, like the former, should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every Mason, as a safeguard or security against any illegal attack that may be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from him any of those secrets with which he has been so solemnly intrusted, and which were emblematically represented upon his first ad - mission into the lodge Prudence Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge and prudentially determine all things relative to our present as well as to our future happiness. This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token, or word whereby the secrets of Masonry might be un - lawfully obtained *** Justice Justice is that standard, or boundary of right, which enables us to render to every man hisjust due without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and, asjustice in a great measure constitutes the real good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every N4ason, never to deviate from the minutest principle thereof **** * * * * CHARGE My Brother; as you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honorable order; ancient, as having existed from time immemorial; and honorable, as tend - ing, in every particular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No in - stitution was ever raised on a better principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lec - tures. The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate: to God, your neighbor, and your - self. To God, in never mentioning His name but F"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"26 MONITOR THE ENTERED APPRENTICE MASON 27 with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings; and to esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you. And to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attach - ment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the state, you are to be a quiet and peace - ful subject, true to your government, and just to your country; you are not to countenance dis - loyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. My brother, I would that you could fully realize what it is to be without a family, without a home, and without a country. And if you ever are tempted to say a word, or do a thing that should put a bar between you and your family, your home, and your country, pray God in His mercy to take you, that instant, home to His own heaven. Stick by your family, my brother; forget you have a self, while you do everything for them. Think of your home, my brother; write and send and talk about it. Let it be nearer and nearer to your thought the farther you have to travel from it; and rush back to it when you are free. And for your country, my brother, and for that flag; never dream a dream but of serv - ing her as she bids you, though the service carry you through a thousand hells. No matter what happens to you, no matter who flatters you or who abuses you, never look at another flag. Never let a night pass but you pray God to bless that flag. Remember, my brother, that behind all these men you have to do with, behind of - ficers and government, and people, even, there is the Country Herself, your Country; and that you belong to Her as you belong to your own mother. Stand by her, my brother, as you would stand by your mother. In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid cen - sure or reproach. Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity, or influence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations; for these are, on no account, to be neglected. Neither, are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ig - norance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well informed brethren, who will be al - ways as ready to give, as you will be ready to receive, instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the brder, as these are to distin - guish you from the rest of the community and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a per - son desirous of being initiated into Masonry,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"28 MONITOR be particularly careful not to recommend him unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects.

THE FELLOW CRAFT MASON Masonry is a progressive science, and is divided into different degrees, for the more regular advancement in the knowledge of its mysteries. According to the progress we make, we limit or extend our inquiries; and inpropor - tion to our capacity, we attain to a lesser or greater degree ofperfection. Masonry includes within its circle almost every branch ofpolite learning. Under the veil of its mysteries is comprehended a regular sys - tem ofscience. Many of its illustrations may ap - pear unimportant; but, the man of enlarged faculties wiliperceive them to be, in the highest degree, useful and interesting. To please the accomplished scholar and ingenious artist, Masonry is wisely planned; and; in the inves - tigation of its latent doctrines, the philosopher and mathematician may experience equal delight and satisfaction. To exhaust the various subjects of which it treats would transcend the powers of the brightest genius; however, nearer approaches to perfection may be made, and the man of wisdom will not check the progress of his abilities, though the task he at - tempts may at first seem insurmountable. Per - severance and application remove each difficulty as it occurs. Every step he advances, newpleasures open to his view, and instruction of the noblest kind attends his researches. In the diligent pursuit of knowledge, the intellec - tual faculties are employed in promoting the glory of God and the good of man."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"30 MONITOR ThE FELLOW CRAFT MASON 31 The EnteredApprentice degree is well cal - culated to enforce the duties of morality and imprint on the memory the noblest principles which can adorn the human mind It is, there - fore, the best introduction to the Fellow Craft degree, which not only extends the same plan, but comprehends a more diffusive system of knowledge.

Speculative By Speculative Masonry, we learn to sub - due the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion, as to lay us under obligation to pay that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative Mason to view, with reverence and admiration, the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most ex - alted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator. **** in six days God created the heaven and the earth, and rested upon the seventh day; the seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labors; thereby enjoying frequent Qpportunities to con - template the glorious works of creation, and to adore their great Creator. * * * * /1 [ I The Globes are two artificial spherical bodies, on the convex surfaces of which are represented the countries, seas, and various parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions and other particulars.

Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and His works, and are induced to encourage the studies of asironomy, geog - raphy, navigation, and the arts dependent upon them, by which society has been so much benefited. * * * * L Order in Architecture By order in Architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornamenis of columns and pilasters; or it is a regular ar - rangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. From the first formation of society, Order in Architecture may be traced. When the rigor of the seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint, originally, proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Com - posite. The Tuscan The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the five orders. Ii was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and en - tabulature have but few moldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be su - perfluous. The Doric The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"38 MONITOR THE FELLOW CRAFT MASON 39 most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has sel - dom any ornaments on base or capital, except moldings; though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Ionic The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high, its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has den - tils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity dis - played in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the famous temple of Diana at Ephesus was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young woman, of an elegant shape, dressed in her hair, as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man. The Corinthian The Corinthian, the richest of the five or - ders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is orna - mented with curious devices, the cornice with dentils and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth, by Callimachus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the following remarkable circumstance. Acci - dently passing by the tomb of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys covered by a tile, placed over an acanthus root, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encompassed the basket, till, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction, and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with the ob - ject, set about imitating the figure. The vase of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus, the tile; and the volutes, the bending leaves. The Composite The Composite is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corin - thian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has quarter rounds, as the Tuscan and Doric or - ders, is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentils or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. Three orders, alone, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other. The two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state; and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"40 MONITOR THE FELLOW CRAFT MASON 41 the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. Of these five orders, the Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian, as the most ancient, are most es - teemed by Masons. The Ionic, from the skill and ingenuity displayed in its construction, is emblematic of the column of Wisdom, which is situated in the east part of the lodge, and is represented by the Worshipful Master; the Doric, from the massive strength of its struc - ture, is emblematic of the column of Strength, which is situated in the west part of the lodge, and is represented by the Senior Warden; and the Corinthian, from the exuberance of its or - naments, is emblematic of the column of Beauty, which is situated in the south part of the lodge, and is represented by the Junior War - den. The Five Senses of Human Nature * * * * Hearing Hearing is that sense by which we distin - guish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. We are en - dowed with hearing, that by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete. Seeing Seeing is that sense by which we distinguish objects. Nay, more; by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and af - fections of our fellow creature, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. Feeling Feeling is that sense by which we distin - guish the different qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion, and extension. Smelling Smelling is that sense by which we distin - guish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Hence, it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the Great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in respiration. Tasting Tasting enables us to make a proper distinc - tion in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Smelling and tasting are inseparably connected; and it is by"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"42 MONITOR THE FELLOW CRAFT MASON 43 the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices. On the mind, all our knowledge must depend; what therefore, can be a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons? By anatomical dissection and observation, we be - come acquainted with the body; but, it is by the anatomy of the mind alone, we discover its powers and principles. To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God’s bounty to man, we shall add that memory, imagination, taste, reasoning, moral perception, and all the active powers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field for philosophical disquisition, which far exceed human inquiry, and are peculiar mysteries, known only to nature and to nature’s God, to whom we are all indebted for creation, preser - vation, and every blessing we enjoy. Hearing, Seeing, and Feeling **** Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences * * * * Grammar Grammar teaches the proper arrangement~ of words according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people; and that excellency of pronunciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeable to reason and correct usage. Rhetoric Rhetoric teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with propriety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance; wisely contriving to cap - tivate the hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat and exhort, to admonish or applaud. Logic Logic teaches us to guide our reason disc re - tionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce, and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted, or granted; and, in it, are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning, and disposing; all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally determined. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation, or groundwork, of our in - quiries; particularly, in the pursuit of those sub - lime principles which claim our attention as Masons. Arithmetic Arithmetic teaches the power and proper - ties of numbers, which are affected by letters, tables, figures, and instruments. By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given for find - ing out any certain number, whose relation or affinity to another is already known or dis - covered."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"44 MONITOR f THE FELLOW CRAFT MASON 45 Geometry Geometry treats of the powers and proper - ties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered, from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a superficies to a solid. A point is a di men - sionless figure, or an indivisible part of space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity; namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions; namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions; namely, length, breadth, and thickness. In fine, geometry is the foundation of architecture, and the root of mathematics. Music Music teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose delighful harmony, by a math - ematical and proportional arrangement of acute, grave, and mixed sounds. Astronomy Astronomy is that divine art by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the Almighty Creator, in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive unparalleled instances of wisdom and goodness; and, through the whole creation,, trace the glorious Author by His works. * * * * Of the Moral Teachings of Geometry * * * * Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"F 46 MONITOR Masonry is erected. By geometry, we may curiously trace nature, through her various windings, to her most concealed recesses. By it, we discover the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the propor - tions which connect this vast machine. By it, we discover how the planets move in their dif - ferent orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it, we account for the return of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye. Number - less worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same un - erring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observations of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ig - norance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monu - ments of antiquity, on which the utmost exer - tions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, not- THE FELLOW CRAFT MASON 47 withstanding, has still survived. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. Tools and implements of architecture are selected by the Fraternity to imprint on the memory wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired, the excellent tenets of our institu - tion. * * * * The letter G, wherever spoken of in Mason - ry as a symbol, is merely a modern substitute for the Hebrew letter Yod; which was the ini - tial ofJehovah, the Tetragammaton, and there - fore constantly used as a symbol of Deity.

You are not to pal - liate, or aggravate, the offenses of your brethren; but, in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends, so effectual - ly, to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration. Especial - ly, the science of geometry, which is estab - lished as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the wonderful properties 0 [nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new character, it is ex - pected that you will conform to ffie principles of the order, by steadily persevering in the prac - tice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagements as a Fellow Craft Mason; and, to ihese duties, you are bound by the most sacred ties. THE MASTER MASON SYMBOLISM OF THE DEGREE If the first degree is intended as a repre - sentation ofycuth, and the secon4 ofmanhoo4 the thir4 or Master Mason, is emblematic of old age, its trials, with its sufferings, and its final termination in death. The time for toiling is now over; the opportunity to learn has passed away; the spiritual temple that we all have been striving to erect in our hearts is now nearly completecL and the wearied workman awaits only the summons from our Father, to call him from the labors of earth to the eternal refreshment of Heaven. Hence, this is byfarthe most solemn and impressive of the degrees of Masonry; and it has, in consequence of the profound truths which it inculcates, been dis - tinguished by the Craft as the sublime degree. As an Entered Apprentice, the Mason was taught those elementary instructions which were to fit him for further advancement in his profession~, just as the youth is supplied with that rudimentary education which is toprepare him for entering on the active duties of life. As a Fellow Craft the Mason is directed to con - tinue his investigatipns in the science of the in - stitution, and to labor diligently in the tasks it prescribes, just as the man is required to en - large his mind by the acquisition of new ideas, and to. extend his usefulness to his fellow crea - tures; but~ as a Master Mason, the Mason is"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"50 MONITOR V taught the last, the most importan4 and the most necessary of truths, that having been faithful to all his trusts, he is at last to die, and to receive the rewards of his fidelity. It was the single object of all the ancient rites and mysteries practiced in the very bosom ofpagan darkness, shining as a solitary beacon in all that surrounding gloom, and cheering the philosopher in his weary pilgrimage of life, to teach the immortality of the soul. This is still the great design of the Master Mason Degree. This is the scope and aim of its ritual. The Master Mason represents man, when youth, manhoo4 old age, and life itself have passed away as fleeting shadows, yet raised from the grave of iniquity, and quickened into another and a better existence. By its legend and all its ritual; it is implied that we have been redeemed from the death of sin and the sepulchre ofpol - lution. “The ceremonies and the lectures, “as a dis - tinguished writer has observea; “beautifully il - lustrate this all engrossing subject, and the conclusion we arrive at is, that youth, p roper - ly dire cte4 leads us to honorable and virtuous maturity, and that the life of man, regulated by morality, faith, and justice, will be rewarded at its closing hour by the prospect of eternal bliss.” This has very properly been called the sub - lime degree of a Master Mason~, as well for the solemnity of the ceremonies which accompany it, as for the profound lessons of wisdom which THE MASTER MASON 51 it inculcates. The important design of the de— gree is to symbolize the great doctrines of the resurrection of the body and the immortality of the soul. FIRST SECTION The ceremony of raising a candidate to the sublime degree of a Master Mason is par - ticularly described in the first section, which, though brie]; will be found essentially useflil. The Compass is peculiarly consecrated to this degree; because, within its extreme points, when properly extende4 are emblematically said to be enclosed the principal tenets of our profession; an4 hence the moral application of the Compass in the MasterMason Degree is to those precious jewels of a Master Mason, Friendship, Morality, and Brotherly Love. * * * *"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"52 MONITOR Ecciesiastes XII. 1-7 Stars (~) denote raps of the gavel. ~r Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain; ~ in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, ~ and those that look out of the windows be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the streets, ~ when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low.

The legend of the third degree has been con - sidered of so much importance that it has been preserved in the symbolism of every Masonic rite. No matter what modifications or altera - tions the general system may have undergone, no matter how much the ingenuity or the im - agination of the founders of rites may have per - verted or corrupted other symbols, abolishing the old and substituting new ones, the legend of the Temple Builder has ever been left un - touche4 to present itself in all the integrity of its ancient mythical form. The idea of the legend was undoubtedly borrowed from the Ancient Mysteries, where the lesson was the same as that now conveyed in the Master Mason Degree. Viewed in this light, it is evi - dent that it is not essential to the value of the symbolism that the legend should be proved to be historical. Whether considered as a truthful narrative of an event that actually transpired during the building of the Temple, or simply as a myth, embodying the utterances of a religious sentiment, the symbolic lesson of life and death and immortality is still contained in its teach - ings, and commands our earnest attention. * * * * “Nearer, My God to Thee” or other suitable hymn may be sung if desired2 * * * * Again, is the lesson taught here, as it was in the first degree, that a Mason should not enter upon any great and important undertaking without first invoking the blessing ofDeity. But, the symbolism here is still further extende4 and the candidate, representing one who is about to enter upon the pilgrimage of life, and all its danger and temptations, first is supposed to lay down upon his trestleboard the designs of labor, of honest ambition, or of virtuous pleasure, upon which he is about to enter; and then, to invoke the protection and blessing of God upon his future career.

The number twelve was celebrated as a mystical number in the ancient systems, of which it has already been said that Masonry is a philosophical development. The number there referred to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and in those Masonic rites in which the builder is made the symbol of the sun, the twelve Fel - low Crafts refer to the twelve signs in which alone the sun is to be sought for. But, in the York Rite, this symbolism is lost, because Hiram there represents man, and not the sun. But, the ancient number has still been preserved. Portal says the number twelve was a perfect and complete number. The number thirteen indicated the commencement of a new course of life; and hence, it became the emblem of death The number twelve has al - ways been considered as a sacred number; wit - ness the 12 great gods of the Greeks and Romans; the 12 altars ofJanus, referring to the 12 months of the year, the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 Apostles, and a hundred other instances that, if necessary, might be cited2 A Seafaring Man A seafaring man is one who follows the sea as a calling. In modern times they are called sailors. There were many of them in and around the ancient seaport ofJoppa which was a port of call for ships sailing the Mediter - ranian Sea.

At the time of the building of the Temple it was the only seaport possessed by the Israelites, and was therefore the point through which allpas - sage out of or into the country was effected The word means a traveler, (one who pas - ses over the roaa; derived from way or road), and the word fare, in its old meaning of to pass or go over. Bailey defines a wayfaring man as ~~one who is accustomed to travel over the roads. “it is with this meaning, frequently found in Scr4ture, as inJudges XIX. 17; “And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city.” Such a man, having perhaps just landed at Joppa, and on his way to the interior would be most likely to be met near that city and would be best enabled to give any information wanted as to the con - dition of the shipping in the harb or, or in rela - tion to any other matter connected with a passage. Mount Calvary The small hill near Mount Moriah can be clearly identified by the most convincing analogies as being no other than Mount Cal - vary. Thus Mount Calvary was a small hill; it was situated west from the Temple, and near Mount Moriah; it was on the direct road from Jerusalem to Joppa, and is thus the very spot where a weary brother, traveling on that roaa; would find it convenient to sit down to rest and refresh himself; it was outside of the gate of the Temple, and lastly, there are several caves, or clefts in the rocks, in the neighborhooa; one of which, it will be rememberea; was, subsequent to the time of this tradition, used as the sepulchre ofourLord. The Master Mason will readily perceive the peculiar character of the symbolism which this identification of the spot on which the great truth of the resurrection was unfolded in both systems, the Masonic and the Christian, must suggest."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"60 MONITOR The Sprig of Acacia The Sprig ofA cacia is an important symbol in Freemasonry. It is an evergreen that grows in great abundance in the vicinity ofJerusalem. The tabernacle and its furniture, with the Ark of the Covenant, was made out of it, and it was consecrated; from among the other trees of the forest, to sacred purposes. As a symbol, it received; among the an - cients, three interpretations. 1. In consequence of its incorruptible and evergreen nature, it was readily adopted as a symbol of the immortality of the soul. 2. In allusion to the derivation of its name, among the Greeks, from a word which signifies freedom from sin, it was also adopted as a sym - bol of innocence. 3. Like all the other sacred plants, such as the myrtle, the mistletoe, and the lotus, which were used in the Ancient Mysteries, it became a symbol of initiation. The three interpreta - tions combined teach us, by the use of this one symbol; that in the initiation of life and death, of which the initiation in the third degree is simply emblematic, innocence must, for a time, lie in the grave; at length, however, to be called by the Grand Master of all things to immor - tality.

From Josephus, we learn that, although seven years were occupied in building it, ye4 during the whole term, it rained not in the daytime, that the workmen might not be obstructed in their labor; and; from sacred hi story, it appears that there was neither the sound of the hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard in the house"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"66 MONITOR THE MASTER MASON 67 while it was building.

There were employed in its building, three Grand Masters; three thousand and three hundred Masters, or overseers of the work; eighty thousand Fellow Crafts; and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices, or bearers of burdens. All these were classed and arranged in such a manner, by the wisdom of Solomon, that neither envy, discord, nor confusion were suffered to interrupt that universal peace and tranquility which pervaded the world at this im - portant period.

I f I The Three Steps The three steps, usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet, are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life; namely, Youth, Manhood, and Age.

The Beehive The beehive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust.

The Forty-Seventh Problem of Euclid {"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"73 72 MONITOR The forty-seventh problem of Euclid was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythagoras, who in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of priesthood, and raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and, more espe - cially, in Geometry, or Masonry. On this sub - ject he drew out many problems and theorems; and, among the most distinguished, he erected this, when, in thejoy of his heart, he exclaimed, “Eureka” in the Grecian language, signifying “I have found it;” and, upon the discovery of which, he is said to have sacrificed a hundred head of cattle. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences.* * This problem is thus enunciated by Euclid: “In any right angled triangle, the square which is described upon the side subtending the right angle is equal to the square described upon the sides which contain the right angle.” Euclid; Book I, Problem #4 7. The discovery of the proof of this proposi - tion is attributed to Pythagoras (550 B.C.), and the proposition is usually called the Pythagorean Proposition.

My Brother, the second, or last, class of Masonic emblems consists of the Setting Maul, the Spade, the Coffin, and the Sprig of Acacia.

My Brother, be ever mindful of that great change, when you will be called from your labors on earth to everlasting refreshment in the Paradise of God. Let me admonish you, in the most solemn manner, in reference to the close of life, that, when the cold winter of death shall have passed, and the bright summer morn of the resurrection appears; when the Son of Righteousness shall descend and send forth His angels to collect the ransomed dead; then, if you are found worthy, by the benefit of having lived a pure and blameless life, with a firm reliance on Divine Providence,yOu shall receive a ready admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe forever presides and forever"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"76 MONITOR THE MASTER MASON 77 reigns.Then shall you see the King in the beauty of His holiness, and with Him enter into an endless eternity.

No, bless God, we pause not at the first or second step; but, true to our principles, look forward for greater Light; and as the embers of mortality are faintly glim - mering in their sockets of existence, the Bible removes the dark cloud, draws aside the sable curtains of the tomb, bids hope and joy arouse us, cheers and sustains the departing spirit. It points beyond the grave and bids us turn our eyes with faith and confidence upon the open - ing scenes of eternity. And now, my Brethren, let us see to it, and so regulate our lives by the Plumb line of Jus - tice and Truth, squaring our actions by the Square of Virtue; so that, when the summons for our departure comes, we shall be found ready. Let us practice, assiduously, the noble tenets of our profession, Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. From the Square, let us learn morality; from the Level, equality; and from the Plumb, rectitude of life.

Finally, my Brethren, let us all keep in memory this solemn truth: we know not how soon the hour of our dissolution may come, when the cold winds of death are sighing around us, and their cjPlly dews glisten on our foreheads; for man that is born of woman is of a few days and full of trouble; he cometh forth as a flower and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not; in the midst of life we are in death.
