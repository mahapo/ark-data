The simple method will be explained here. If the auditorium has an outer and inner curtain, a good portion of the worry is elim - inated. The front curtain, of course, is the regular “house curtain.” An inner curtain is one that is about four feet behind the front curtain and usually works on a “traveler” or track, opening from side to side. This inner curtain should ‘be used for the Prologue and Epilogue. It can also be used for the Tomb scene by merely placing a few decrepil5 looking tombstones (scene painted, of course, and easy to handle) on and a large one in center between the two curtains to place the candidate therein, or merely place the candidate between the opening of the curtains, surmising it to be a tomb. You must keep the lights on a dim blue or green for this scene. The MOKANNA Court scene should be set about half stage—using the inner curtain when open as a neutral leg drop. The throne ‘chair and shrine with the glowing heart and other court decorations are used to glorify the scene and you can have guards and courtiers in gala attire as you desire. The Haunted Forest drop should be hung down stage behind the inner curtain. When this drop is in position you clear or “strike” the Mokanna set and make ready the Grotto or Caidron scene. All these should be pre-set before you start your show. To go into the Caldron scene you merely “take away” the Haunted Forest drop. From the Caldron you go into the Tomb scene. This can be another painted drop or use the inner curtain as above suggested. If you use a painted drop, it should be hung immediately behind the Haunted Forest drop. While the Tomb scene is on, you pre~pare for the Storm scene. The back drop for this can be a special one— your Grotto drop—or a plain gray or dirty back wall. Your cloud machine and lighting effects, with the wave cloth, boat, etc., are what make this scene. It should not be brightly lighted, but a dim blue used. The Imperial Chamber of Gehenna can be another special drop, or the cave or Grotto scene can be again utilized. Just give His Majesty a fiery-looking throne, on a dais if possible, with red lighting, etc., and you have your scene. Back to the court of Mokanna as before—then “close in~~ with the inner curtain for the Epilogue and you have your show. 15"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"is U isO lxii.J ‘~ ‘is’ 0; is,. ~ 1 I-i ~ z E IMPORTANT MONITORIAL SUGGESTION TO THE CAST Nothing but most careful study of the Ritual will qualify the members of the cast to properly present the ceremonial work of the Grotto Each member must not only commit his part so r thoroughly that the words will flow easily and naturally, but he must also make himself so familiar with the entire ‘work that he will have a clear conception of his role, as it relates to other parts, in word and action. .~ ~ Just as the professional actor seeks to give the stamp of individuality to his work; so should the leading members of the cast aspire to present really artistic creations which will illuminate the text of the drama and make it intensely interesting. a bt a In this connection it may ‘be said that the notes which accompany the lines of the drama are intended to be merely suggestions, and are not to be considered as absolutely binding. THE CAST 0 ~~Iti Ca . The cast should be organized as a Degree Team and o ~ be under the management of a director. z S The director should have power to select the niem - 2j~ ~4141 hers of the cast, be should also select his assistants, U and be held responsible for the training of the team.

STAGE EQUIPMENT Whatever scheme of stage equipment is adopted will have to be worked out according to the circumstances surrounding each case, but, in a general way, it may he said that the equipment must include a curtain, and drops as follows: Mokanna’s Court, Eaunted Forest, Wood Scene, rocks, stumps, etc., Caidron, tomb, Storm and River, Imperial Chamber of Gehenna, also wing, fly and borders to match each drop.

The stage should be large enough to accommodate the cast and to set the v~rious scenes necessary to make a full presentation 6f the 5 ania. It niust be equipped with paraphernalia especially designed for the work, and so arranged that the necessary changes of scenes can be made with the least possible loss of time. When a ceremonial session is to follow a business session of the Grotto, the curtain must be down during the business session, also during the presentation of the Prologue. Everything possible to save time should be (lone when a ceremonial session is to be held, therefore, the stage should be fully set in advance, and the cast should dress while the business session is progressing, so that the ceremonial can procesd immediately after tuisiness is disposed of. Transaction of business and preparation of candi - dates may be done in the afternoon, then, after ad - journment for refreshments, the Grotto can proceed with the ceremonial without loss of time. GROTTO ORGANIZATIONS Whenever possible, it is advisable for the Grotto to form within its membership, one or more organizations for special purposes, such as Grotto Band, Drill Corps, Glee Club, Orchestra, Greeters, Cast Club, Lunch Club, Bowling League, etc. Suoh organizations contribute greatly to the welfare of the Grotto, because they serve to entertain and keep up an active interest on the part of the membership; they also serve as valuable adjuncts in ceremonial work. PROLOGUE Note: The Monarch, Chief Justice, Master of Cere - monies, Orator and Grand Chamberlain enter from rear of the hall, down the center aisle, onto the stage and take their stations in front of the curtain. If an or - chestra is in pit, it will then play march. Candidates places in front rows. (The above is optional, the offi - cern can be on the stage when the curtain goes up, or can enter from center or sides of the stage, with the exception of the ‘Grand Chamberlain, wh.o should be on the level of the candidates.) CEREMONIAL DRAMA SECTION The Prologue and Epilogue being definitely not a part of the dramatic section, should not be given in costume or the heavy colored uncomfortable and ter - rible looking robes that are so often used. These two portions of the ceremonial are much better and more impressive if the officers, or cast members doing this part are dressed in tuxedos, or neat uniform, business suits, alike if possible. (If summertime dress alike in sports clothing is distinctive ) A ribbon with the name of the Grotto thereon, worn over the shoulder as a baldric, as a touch of color; or a wide red ribbon over a toxedo is colorful. The Prologue and Epilogue should be played before an inner curtain, a’ curtain hung four or five feet behind the front or mare curtain; ‘this enables the pre-setting of the Mokanna Court scene, and if that is set in half-stage, the Caldron scene can also be pre-set. If the inner curtain is not available, then before the regular curtain, if there~- is sufficient “APRON” (space between curtain and edge of stage) to stand in comfort The poem, “IN A FRIENDLY SORT OF WAY”, has been so terribly given on so many occasions that it would have been better to have eliminated it en - tirely. However, it is so appropriate and fitting that it should be given, with the speaker facing the audi - ence, talking out so that the Prophet in the last row hears him as well as the candidate in the first row. The poem should not be given too fast, nor should the last word o’f each line be dropped or lost. Each word should be spoken clearly and distinctly. There should be no movement among the candidates while the poem is being recited, so that there is nothing to distract attention from the speaker. It is not necessary that the Grand Chamberlain re - cite the poem It can be given by any one of the Prophets on the stage at the time In some Grottoes it is done very well by someone off stage speaking through a microphone as though the words were com - ing from another world. The Grand Chamberlain should place the candidates in position before the poem is started, with a Grotto member at the left end of each line so that the left end candidate will have someone to place his hand upon. It is not necessary that the Monarch or Line Officers give the Prologue and Epilogue. They are usually busy with other duties and sometimes do not do it as effectively as the regular members of the cast who would repeat it year after year and are trained and coached in their lines. 22 23"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CHARACTERS IN PROLOGUE AND EPILOGUE Monarch Chief Justice Orator Chaplain Grand Chamberlain CHARACTERS IN THE DRAMA Goodfellow or Narrator (oPtional) Mokanna Sarpedon Guards and Courtiers Wizard Melancholy Despair His Majesty Grand Marshal Mines—Chief Justice of the Realm Charon—Faithful Ferryman of the River Styx Cerberus—Faithful Watchdog of the Realm Chaos—The God of Confusion Rhadamanthus—An intelligent demon and brother of Mines Imps You will note that Goodfellow and Narrator are now two different characters with parts in the Ritual writ - ten for each one.

We are now ready to proceed with your induction, but be - fore you can proceed further in the ceremony, you must give the Prophets here assembled, -.positive assurance of your sincerity, in seeking admission to the Order, by consenting, of your own free will, to proceed and take the Obligation of Veiled Prophet, which will solemnly bind you to secrecy, obedience and loyalty, as a member of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm. This requirement is imperative, and must be cheer - fully complied with, if you wish to proceed farther. In order that you may be better informed before making the irrevocable decision, our Prophet Orator will now briefly explain to you, the nature and purpose of our Order. I charge you to give close attention to his words. ORATOR: Candidates, the Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm originated with Master Masons, good and true. It is therefore fundamentally Ma - sonic. None but Master Masons in good standing ~re eligible to membership, and its superstructure is erected upon the enduring basis of Masonic moral precepts, but it is in no sense a part of Symbolic Craft Masonry, and makes no claim to be such. Its purpose is to foster the spirit of good- fellowship among its members without infringing upon the solemn dignity of the Lodge. For the accomplishment of that purpose, the Order ‘establishes Grottoes wherein Master Masons of all Lodges may meet and cultivate the cheerful side of life, through the enjoyment of social pleasures that serve to break down the barriers of reserve and unites them in a spirit of sympathy and good- fellowship, which brightens their lives and makes them better men and better Masons. Cheerful goodfello’wsWP fcunded upon the prm - ciples of Masonic brotherhood, graced with the charm of true sympathy, is the ideal for which the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm stands. If this ideal appeals to you as being worthy of your loyal support, you will proceed; if not, you will retire. MONARCH: Candidates, the decisive moment has arrived. If there be any who do not wish to proceed, they will now retire. All who wish to proceed raise their right hands in token of their sincerity Grand Chamberlain, you will place the candidates in position.

It makes the sun come out again, It makes the pulses start, You feel a happy throbbing In the region of your heart; You feel a lump within your throat— You don’t know what to say, When a hand is on your shoulder In a friendly sort of way. This world’s a curious compound, With its honey and its gall, Its hopes and disappointments, Rut a good world after all; And a good God must have made it, At least that’s what I say— When a hand is on your shoulder In a friendly sort of way.

During this jeriod many strange cults of fire-worshippers sprang up in Persia, and one with a large following was that of the Prophet Mokanna. This Prophet had been afflicted with a terrible disease known as the black small pox, but so that his followers would not see his affliction, he covered his face wilh a veil, and told them that he was descended from God and that his eyes were so dazzling that humans, until purified, could not look upon his face. To enable the Neophyte to join the ranks of this Prophet, it was necessary that he undertake a long and dangerous journey, overcome all obstacles and return with the Priceless Jewel of the Enchanted Realm, which the Prophet dedicated as Truth. Neophytes, soon you will be introduced into the presence of the Veiled Prophet, the Great Mokanna One of you will be chosen lo venture forth in quest of the Priceless Jewel! His journey will take him through the haunted forest to the borderland be - tween earth and hell into the land of Erebus, the God of Darkness, where he is beset by Melancholy and Despair and other dwellers of this Realm of shade. A stranger in a strange land, he is warned to depart, but heedless of all warnings, he wanders near the borders of the forbidden land where he is discovered by Cerberus, the Watchdog, who guards the entrance to Hades, and is taken before Minos the Chief Justice and Executioner of the U nder - world. His Satanic Majesty is summoned, and the mortal condemned to the usual tortures from which he is saved by Rhadamanthus, the kind and just judge, who discovered that he had stood in the northeast corner of the lodge. The Neophyte is put to the Supreme Test. He makes a perilous journey, beset by all the horrors of the underworld but finally with the assistance of old Charon, he safely crosses the River Styx, where he is again met by his Satanic Majesty, who congratulates him upon his successful journey, and tries to reward him by making him a full fledge Imp. However, because the light of good- fellowship is discovered shining on his brow, he is 30 driven from Hell at the order of his majesty who gives him the Priceless Jenel of the Enchanted Realm which was all that remained to remind him of his lost estate. The quest is ended. The powers of evil have been overcome by a heart glowing with sympathy and a countenance beaming with the war mth of goodfellowshiP. The purpose of this drama is primarily initiation, but it also serves as a noble example of the Neophyte overcoming all obstacles and returning with the Priceless Jewel of the Enchanted Realm, and culminates in a grand climax, when the NeQ - phyte returns triumphant and is hailed with joyous enthusiasm and acclamation amid the splendor of 1~fokanna’s court. And now on with the play (Spotlight off and curtain up on the Mokanna Court Scene.) (If you decide to continue using the “Goodfellow” part instead of the new !‘Jarration, you will start thus—) (After the obligation, Monarch says): Candidates, be seated. (As candidates are seating themselves, lights are dimmed to a blackout—Cfficers leave stage and Goodfellow enters in the dark—slips in on either side or in center——between the center of the curtain, if it is a track-operated one, and with the curtain itself for a background, a green spotlight is slowly focused upon him. This Goodfellow should be a rather tall man if possible, and dressed as DANTE —a long, greenish robe which covers the feet. There should be a hood on the robe with a slight peak in the rear and the front should be so that merely the face shows. He should have a smile on his face, rather sardonic—a smooth face—no beard—perhaps make-up, rather light-brown on the lips. He should speak SLOWLY for the most part, and where there may be a doubt as to the success of the journey he is describing, the sardonic grin helps give assurance of a bit of bewilderment or doubt to the candidates. GOODFELLOW should be in place at the end of each scene so as to be “spotted” and then “slink off” at the end of his lines. This little interval by the Goodfellow should fill any ~ap or time required so that there be t’4O WAITS between scene changes. This drama or ritual should be given and is so being done by many Grottoes, that there are absolutely NO WAITS from the moment that the Prologue begins and the Epilogue ends. A little judicious planning and cooperation is all that is neccessary.) (Green spotlight upon Goodfellow 31 I If 0"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1 hut! tin! Ho!

So now—let us go back—back 100 years—another hnndred—500 years—1,000 years—1,200 years. Behold! We find ourselves in the court and in the presence of’ the Veiled Prophet Mokanna himself. (Spotlight off and curtain up on Mokanna scene.) SCENE 1 MOKANNA COURT (This can be as elaborate an ancient Persian Court as you care to make it. It is recommended, however, that it be confined, if possible, to only half-stage depth, thus permitting the main part of the Caidron or Grotto Scene to be pre-set. This also permits the Haunted Forest drop to be lowered in front of the main proper - ties of this scene, and then removed QUIETLY while the Haunted Forest scene is in progress. The Veiled Prophet is seated on his throne in rear of stage, left of center, the shrine can be upstage in center, or it can be a little to the right, of these positions. Mokanna’s throne and shrine can be reversed. These scenes cnn be dressed up with courtiers, guards, magicians, enter - tainers, etc. Music and entertainment can be in progress as curtain nses and continuesi for a few minutes, then Sarpedon, down right addressing Mokanna, says): SARPEI) ON: Oh, Mighty Mokanna! These Neophytes, all bravery and belief, bow in suppliance before thy throne, and vow subservience to thy laws and mysteries till in the grave. MOKANNA: Neophytes, we greet ye! Welcome to our glorious standard. (Standard can be on stage and referred to by mdi - catron, or brought in by guard and placed and re- ferred to at the time.) From this hour ye are forever bound to my service. Yet, ere ye can enter into my Fellowship and stand with the faithful of the Realm, ye must be proved worthy by supreme tests. He on whom the lot shall fall must make the quest through Earth and Air, through grisly paths of black despair, the flaming depths of Hell must dare, for the Priceless Jewel of the Enchanted Realm. Are ye, all bravery and be - lief, still minded to join my faithful host? NEOPHYTES: I am. MOKANNA: Then bow thy luckless heads, the lot shall fall. Sarpedon, cast the fateful lot. (Sarpedon draws name from urn or vase and reads slowly the name of the candidate selected. Grand Chamberlain brings him on stage and places robe on him.) (A very effective way to get name is to have iron kettle on stage with small electric heating unit in same. Sarpedon has small can with a little black powder in it which he throws into iron pot as the powder hits the heat unit, up comes a cloud of smoke, out of which Sarpedon appears to read the name of candidate.) MOKIANNA: When fell the fateful lot, Neophytes, ye faltered not. Thus proven, all bravery and belief, I take ye for 32 33"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"miuine own, bounden forever to my throne. Go forth at the trumpet’s call, my glorious banner to uphold. (Then turning to Neophyte) But woe to see thou luckless wight, clothed in pilgrim garb. Seek thou alone the Priceless Jewel of the Enchanted Realm. Thy quest will lead thee to the depth of Hell, to that place of horrors, where demons dwell. May the genial glow of a vision splendid attended thy quest in triumph ended. Ere l~hou depart, I present thee an amulet. (Sarpedon procures the amulet, which is a Grotto emblem on a cord. It can be on a small etand near Mokanna. He hands it to Mokanna who places it around the Neophyte’s neck like a necklace). Wear thou it constantly, for it holds a charm to shield thee from all danger and harm And now, Sarpedon, conduct the bewildered hopeful to the edge of the Haunted Forest, that mystic and gruesome domain, betwixt earth and hell. Thou wilt there leave him alone) Then addressing Neophyte Thou wilt be dolorously and ghoulishly greeted by gloomy denizens and demons that inhabit the regions through which thou wilt pass. Dependent upon thy deportment, courage, cheerfulness, depth of sincerity and honesty of purpose will be the re - ception and personal treatment which thou wilt ex - perience through the ordeals which will surely follow. And so, farewell! (Trumpet blows, and Sarpedon slowly conducts Neo - phyte off tsage as curtain fails (At end of Mokanna Court Scene curtain closes and lights dim out, then green spotlight upon Goodfel - low, who has taken his place in front of curtain as before. Note: Stage crew should now QUIETLY remove or “Strike” the Mbkanna scene and place the Haunted Forest drop in place. This drop should be “down stage.” i e, towards the audience and about four or five feet if possible behind the front curtain. This change can be made in a fraction of a minute. The Mokanna scene should be set in not more than half stage—i e., about half way back This ~. ran ient also eiiables the Caidron and Cal - dron urop be pre-set. That is all set before the show starts. In this way you merely “talie away” for the first few scenes, or set while one scene is being played. (QUIETLY, of course.) (Stage crew prepares Haunted Forest scene. Good- fellow on and green spotlight on him.) 34 GOODFELLOW: Leaving the court of Mokanna you will again use your imagination and we will go f ar—far—far - away to the land of Mythology—(This line should be done slowly and impressively with a slow sweep - ing gesture and with the proper expression on the face and with the eyes, indicating the mental trans - portation to the realms of mythology) where you will find strange creatures mocking at you—Mel - ancholy and Despair x~ill grip your soul—but—with your hope, determination, laughter and reason— you persistently journey on—so—again let us trav - el farther—farther on into the realm of phantasy —into the land ot’ Mythology—to that region of horrors—betwii~t Earth and Hell — the Haunted Forest! (Spotlight out—Goodfellow slinks off and curtain up on Haunted Forest Scene—in blue or green light —at end of scene as Meiancholy drives Neophyte to his “doorn”—lights slowly out—curtain down— Goodfelloxv in place and green spotlight on him— remove Haunted Forest drop and have Caldron ready—lighted in red.) SCENE TWO THE HAUNTED FOREST This should be set in what we call one or one and one-half. Which means down stage, utilizing about one- third or one-fourth of the stage depth. This enables the stage crew to QUIETLY strike or remove the Mokanna Court scene and set the Caldron or Grotto scene. The Haunted Forest should be dimly lighted in blue with a green spotlight focused upon MELANCHOLY, who should be squatted left of center as far back as possible. If the spotlight is used, it can be switched to catch and follow DESPAIR when he enters from left. Remember right and left means the right and left as the actor faces the audience. Curtain up slowly, when it is up, MELANCHOLY speaks gloomily, dis - dainfully, slowly and with pessimistic conviction— sort of thinking out aloud. MELANCHOLY: 0! dismal abode of grief and woe, through all eter - nity, am I destined to linger harrowing here, stealing away the effulgence of HUMAN ASPIRATIONS endlessly the pilgrims come, endlessly I strive to disillusion them, with the philosophy of bitter truth.

DESPAIR: Come, come, my dear fellow, come! I am DESPAIR, you know—and may take ANYONE. (Nodding head.) Yes, I torture and twist the mind—thwart worldly ambitions, cajole into madness, even lead to SUICIDE, Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha! I have been lurking, in the background of your being for a long, long time, and have followed you closely since Sarpedon left you at the edge of this forest. You have been hopelessly, aimlessly, wandering for many days, and, I ask you, what for! WHAT FOR, I ask! Why? (stepping closer to him and smiling). I am getting closer, closer, with hopelessness, despondency, des - peration. These, I give you (getting a closer look at his face, then with a change of intonation and a slight step backward) What? Thou fearest me not but appear joyous and contended, BAR! I like this not in thee. Smiles, laughter, the joy of doing for others, contentment, happiness, these characteristics in mortals are not to my liking! They only frustrate the aims of despair.

That is better, flow come, come with me to the cave of DESPAIR. (Take Neophyte by left arm and start a few steps toward center, as WIZARD enters from left, sees DESPAIR and Neophyte, peers at them with astonishment and wonder, then speaks.) WIZARD: Despair! DESPAIR: Ah! You old WIZARD, you here again. You who fear not DESPAIR. WIZARD: (Laughingly) Yes, ‘tis I, the old WIZARD, who have mastered thee and fear thee not, I laugh at thee, Ho! Ho! Ho! Get thee gone, go ojin thy companions Melancholy and Confusion. 36 WIZARD: Away with you. Away! (DESPAIR leaves and slinks ‘off right first en - trance, WIZARD then approaches Neophyte, scru - tinizes him from all sides, feels him, then, appar - ently ‘satisfied, nodding his head, speaks. WIZARD should not show anger, ‘but rather kindly advice.)

Depart, ere vials of wrath break upon thy defenseless head and overwhelm thee with un - utterable woe. I tell thee go. (Turns back to Neo - phyte and starts to walk away, stops, looks over shoulder, acts surprised to see Neophyte still there.) What, thou wilt not? Ah, well, be it so. Fools were ever bold and rush in where angels fear to tread. List, Oh, Neophyte! I could to thee a tale unfold, whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, make thy two eyes like stars start from their sockets, thy knotted locks to part, and each particular hair to stand on end like quills of the fretful porcupine (looking hint over with a knowing smirk). But—nay—I will not! I leave thee to thy fate (seeing and indicating Mel - anchol ). Yea, e’en now brooding and mournful Melancholy hovers near. Fare thee well, fare thee well. (Exits right gleefully, chuckling.) MELANCHOLY: (Rising and crossing to Neophyte, looking him over and to him): Alas, as I thought, another pilgrim, and as usual, rosy with hope’s glowing fire.

With the Caldron back in center, this should be so constructed that a person can be placed in it and later removed, flame and fire effects under and about the Caldron, these effects can be worked out by those interested in lighting and stage mechanics. The stage lighting should be predominantly RED. Flash effects for the entrance of His Majesty are also effective.) (At the rise of the curtain, the Grand Marshal is discovered. He gazes inquiringly off stage, left — crosses to left, peers warningly, decides the red light is glaring, then hurriedly crosses to right and calls). GRAND MARSHAL: Dwellers of the realm of shade!

Assemble in grim mysterious council. The red lights glare and mortals wander near our borders.

CHIEF JUSTICE: Are our borders securely guarded? GRAND MARSHAL: Bravest sentinels are now guarding all our borders. MINOS: (C. J.) ‘Tis well, come, ye Imps of Torture, turn on your fiercest flames (Busy imps at Caidron, flames roaring, etc.) And armed with burning tridents, gleaming forks, and barbed spears, execute His Majesty’s commands, unseasoned with mercy, until the luckless mortal shall howl and curse the hour that brought him here. Bring forth the victim. (Victim is dragged out by Imps, he escapes, is captured, then placed in Caidron.) Drive deep your forks into his q-u-i-v-e-r-i-n-g flesh, Ha! Ha! Ha!

CERBERUS: From being found within our horders, we judge he seeks to gain an entrance to our Realm. MINOS: What purpose can he have in this? CERBERUS: From the manner in which he is clothed, we judge his purpose is to gain a knowledge of our mysteries. MINOS: His curiosity may cost him dear. Can you avouch his sincerity? CERBERUS: I cannot. MINOS: Will you say he is no spy? CERBERUS: I will not. MINOS: Dare you recommend him to our mercy? CERBERUS: I dare not.

Have the “mystical glow” at all times and also contain the “good - fellowship” message and give it at the proper moment. Construct a box about 2 ft~ by S in. by S in. out of 7/S-in, by 1½-in, white pine. The bottom should be solid (½-in. or ¼-in, plywood) the top also solid and hinged to the supporting framework. The sides should be covered with muslin and decoratively painted with dye paint so that with a light inside it will give the glowing effect—on one side—which will be the rear, except when properly placed at the last moment—is placed on the inside-a cardboard with the words GOODFEILLOW’SHIP cut out, so that the light shin - ing through, will show up the words through the dec - orative painting on the cloth side. This is rigged up with batteries concealed inside with two flashlight bulbs. The lights are on when it is placed on a pedes - tal at right of His Majesty in the Gehenna scene—Good- fellowship to rear. His Majesty so picks it up that the wording is to his body and hands it to the candidate in like manner so that the reading is to his body. Later, Sarpedon takes it from candidate so that reading is TO HIS BODY, and walks up to shrine with it—places it directly on shrine and steps back and—behold-—with a little lowering ot stage lights—the Priceless Jewel shines out in all its glory with all on stage at the proper sign. This is about as simple a method of han - dling this d~s’playing of the Goodfellowship and the glowing casket as your committee knows. It takes care of two important items—eliminates’ a lot of wiring, ete Care must ‘be exercised and batteries and bulbs definitely checked beforehand each time, however. The casket is supposed to inclose the Priceless Jewel, which is the object of the quest the Neophyte has made. He is supposed to carry it to Mokanna’s Court, where it will be placed on the Shrine of the Glowing Heart, which must be wired so that when the casket is in posi - tion the words GOODFELLOWSHIP wil[ shine out in bright letters above the Head. The Heart should always glow. The casket should be small enough to be carried con - veniently, and the Neophyte should be instructed to carry it carefully, and proudly, back to Mokanna’s Court. The idea of using the casket is that it gives visible evidence of the trimphant ending of the quest, which is lacking i~ he returns empty-handed. Using the casket in connection with the shrine also insures the flashing of the words, GOOD FELLOW - SHIP, in the right place, and makes it possible to end the drama with greater spectacular effect than could be reached by the simple flashing of the word on the stage.) SCENE 6 THE IMPERIAL CHAMBER OF GEHENNA (Indicate some excitement off stage—right—at rise of curtain. This can be an elaborate hellish scene, or if more convenient and economical the cave scene used in the Caldron scene can be used—without the Cal - dron—but a fiery throne, etc., used to dress it up—red should again be the predominant lighting—at rise of curtain the Imps ,ook off stage right in the direction of the excitement—and excitedly report to His Majesty. All characters should salute His Majesty when address - ing him throughout the drama—with the proper sa - lute.) IMPS: Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Old Charon ap - proaches and has with him a mortal. HIS MAJESTY: Bid Charon enter immediately, and some of ye Imps guard well the mortal. (Charon enters and His Majesty contimes.) Your passage was most stormy and I understanl your passenger is yet alive. CHARON: He is, indeed, Your Majesty, and truly he is a mortal possessed of undaunted fortitude. As to our passage it was vulnerable and most hazardous. Huge moun - tainous waves engulfed us—we were in the midst of violent death-dealing storm and tumult throughout the entire crossing—but—the amazing gallantry— valor and deep conviction of ultimate attainnient— as displayed by this mortal—also (with a smile) thanks to my sturdy craft and my skillful guidance —we reached the shores safely. I endeavored to dissuade him from proceeding further—and offered to guide him safely back to Realms above-but—he could not be swerved from his purpose; so I have conducted him to your dread presence and now he awaits your disposal.

That brand was niade with a roll of red hot brimstone; a hoof will grow there soon. I now crown you with that which is the cardinal delight of impish beauty—a pair of horns. (Charon places horns on Neophyte’s head.) And, lastly, as the supreme reward, I invest you with that which devils sigh for; that which devils cry for; that which devils would even die for a tail! (Charon holds up tail, and then fastens it in proper place on Neophyte.) (As Charon is about to attach the tail, he will cause the Neophyte to rise. When tail is fastened, the Neophyte will be made to face the audience for a moment, then Charon will conduct him to a position near the throne.) 54 F HIS MAJESTY: You have now received the adornments of a full fledged Imp of our Realm. Welcome to our Plu - tonian Shades. (At this point Charon and Neophyte silently con - verse—if you use rehearsed or cast Neophyte, he can speak the following lines. Neophyte removes horns and hurls them at the feet of His Majesty, indicating that these “honors” are not the purpose of his quest.) NEOPHYTE: These adornments are not what I seek. They but symbolize evil and uncontrollable hilarity and eter - nal damnation.

CHARON: Your Majesty, this evidently is not what he seeketh. Possession of the adornments of the Imps of the Realm is not sufficient honor or reward for having suffered the excruciating ordeal of the journey here. His fixed determination is truly baffling. He seeks and will not be satisfied until he receives the PRICE - LESS JEWEL OF THE ENCHANTED REALM! HIS MAJESTY: WHAT? THE PRICELESS JEWEL OF THE EN - CHANTED REALM! BAH! (Slowly.)

At the close of his words, when he says, “this tormenting blight of Hell,” he should seize the casket and place it in the hands of the Neophyte When he says, “Demons, drive him from my sight,” Hell should let loose in angry tumult while the Imps drive the Neophyte from the stage.)

ORATOR: So that you will better understand the secret, or in - side password, I will give you a short explanation of its origin. Abdulla, King of Lesser Bucharia, abdicated his throne in favor of his son, Aliris. Shortly afterward he arranged a marriage between his son, Aliris, and the youngest daughter of the Prince of India. The beautiful Princess named Lalla Rookh, started on the long journey to meet her Prince. She was enter - tained on this journey with music and stories by a poet named * * * * * * * ‘ who had attached himself to the safari as a slave. As she neared her destina - tion she became heartsick at the thought of giving herself to a strange Prince, having fallen in love with the poet slave. Being a true Princess, she stepped into the throne room, to carry out her father’s promise. As the Prince turned to take her hand, she beheld the poet * ***** * who had dis - guised himself as a slave to win her love as well as her hand. ORATOR: A Prophet who is wearing his Fez will give the military salute when reciting the Pledge of Alle - giance and during the playing of the National Anthem A military salute will also be given when the Colors are within six paces of him; RE WILL NOT REMOVE HIS FEZ. After the Colors have passed, he should drop his right hand. In case the same Colors pass the same point again, as frequently happens in a ceremonial procession or in display drills, the Colors need not be saluted the second time. The same rule applies to street parades. ORATOR: The characters you see on the Grotto Banner are Persian. They read from right to left, and spell the name M-O-K-A-N-N-A. MONARCH OF THE GROTTO: Prophets, we welcome you, with all the joy of a Prophet’s greeting, to our fellowship, as Prophets of the Enchanted Realm. The friendly smile which always lights a Prophet’s greeting symbolizes the spirit of the Order, because 65 -J"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"it is radiant with joyous impulses that cheer the heart and make it warm with sympathy and good will. The purpose of the Order is written in smiles, because within our mystic Enchanted Realm the spirit of mirth breaks down the barriers of reserve and brings us close together in the spirit of good- fellowship, and makes us laugh together, like boys unburdened with care. Thus while we revel in the joyous freedom of the Enchanted Realm there grows a bond of sympathy and f~llowship between us which abides and makes the heart glad, because it gratifies its natural longing for delightful associations. I trust that you have indeed found the Priceless Jewel of the Enchanted Realm, and will cherish it for your own happiness and for the glory of the Prophets of the Enchanted Realm, to whose fellow - ship you are now duly admitted. (Presentation of Fez.) PRESENTATION OF FEZ As a fitting climax we strongly recommend that at the end of “The Neophyte’s Journey” a Fez be presented to the Activc Neophyte ‘by one of the three principal officers or some Past Monarch, selected for the purpose. This should be done in front of the curtain immediately fojfowing the conclusion of the ritualistic work or epilogue An app topiiate “Fez Lecture” or charge—not too lengthy—should be delivered—not the ordinary, halting, impromptu presentation speech, but one care - fully plepal ed and memorized by the officer selected. The lectures, published herein, are submitted merely as examples and any Grotto is privileged to substitute another or better one of its own.) I. Prophet , it is now my very great pleasure to present to you a Fez (places Fez on candidate’s head—be sure it is straight. Continues) As the white Lambskin Apron- is the Badge of a Mason, so the Fez of Black with Tassel of Red distinguishes you as a member of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the En - chanted Realm It is the symbol of Sympathy and Goodfellowship. While we as Prophets are taught that the Grotto is “in no sense a part of Symbolic Craft Masonry and makes no claim to be such,” yet each of us must ever bear in mind that as an individual he is a Master Mason The fact that you or I may be wearing the Fez of Black instead of the little White Apron does not release us from the vows we as - sumed at the Altar of Masonry. Though we may not claim to be a Masonic Body, yet in the eyes of 66 the so-called profane, regardless of whether we are clothed as Craftsmen or as Prophets, we are all Masons. See to it that you conduct yourself ac - cordingly, never overlooking the fact that any in - discretion on your part as a Prophet discredits the Masonic Fraternity. llEsgrace the Fez of Black and you likewisi dishonor the Apron of White. The Grotto is termed “The Master Mason’s Play - ground”—and so it is. Let us play, but let us not forget the rules. A true Prophet is a good sport. It matters not to him whether he won or lost, but how he played the game. This Fez is yours. Wear it worthily, wear it proudly as a Prophet and as a gentleman. 2. Prophet, as the White Lambskin Apron is the badge of the Mason, so is the Black Fez, with its Tassel of Red, emblematic of Goodfellowship and Good Cheer. (places Fez on head of candidate Hail, Prophet, Neophyte no more, Thy dreadful journey now is o’er; Thou hast thy valor shown right well In upper air, in deepest Hell. So this reward is thine, my son, This Priceless Jewel thou hast won; ‘Twill be a crown upon thy head— The Fez of Black with Tassel Red. No prince upon his royal chair E’er x~ore a diadem so rare As this Black Fez with letters gold, The badge of Prophets young and old. So wear it proudly, son, and smile, Forget thy troubles for a while And ever may thy watchwords be GOOIJFELLOWSHIP AND SYMPATHY —Tom Fox. FEZ LECTURE (Optional—used by Lalla Rookh Grotto) Prophets; each of you remembers well when you were presented with a White Lambskin Apron, an emblem of innocence and the Badge of a Mason. Now you are privileged to wear the Fez of Lalla Rookh Grotto, the badge of a true Prophet. Let neither badge be worn unworthily. The emblems 67"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"honor you. You can honor them by showing sym - pathy and goodfellowship to your brother Prophets who now welcome you into their mystic Enchanted Realm anticipating added joy for you and them. ‘The Black Fez alludes to “loathed Melancholy of Cerberus and blackest midnight born, in Stygian cave forlorn, ‘mongst horr~d shapes and shrieks and sights unholy!” The~~Red Tas~el alludes to the blood of our brothers shed through the centuries in dispelling the darkness of ignorance and bigotry. The gold alludes to the Priceless Jewel of the En - chanted Realm discovered by every true Prophet in his quest through earth and air, even to the flaming depths of the infernal world, as portrayed in the drama of your induction The Gold of the fez also alludes to victory which inevitably follows the conquest of darkness Victory summons hearteas~ng mirth as the reward of ev - ery Prophet for the purpose of our Order is written in smiles. The Grotto Fez thus symbolizes the ban - ishment of gloom and we proudly accept joy and pleasure as the right and reward of our Mystic Realm Wear, then, your Fez with pride, joy and honor, but never wear it in a place you would not be proud to take your mother, sister, wite or daughter. Let joy be unconfined, but do not mistake the pursuit of joy tor the acceptance of unwholesome pleasures which tarnish the gold of victory. Follow the path of righteousness and you will find the fullness of joy and pleasures for evermore. —Barton Baker, Past ]Vlonarch. (The Fez Lecture is monitorial and non-secret and is given here for the instruction of all Prophets.) (If candidate is known to be a good ertemporaneous speaker, the Monarch will ask him to respond in a few words, after which the Monarch will announce the con - clusion of the first section and advise audience when the Revels Sections will begin.) SHORT FORM INITIATION Neither your Ritual Committee nor Supreme Council Officers favor the use of a “Short Form” Initiation as a substitute for a Full Form Ceremonial. We will all agree that the candidate does not receive full value for his fee to which he is entitled. 68 We realize, however, that at times emergencies will arise, making it necessary to initiate candidates in abbreviated form. Therefore, under such circumstances only we recommend the follpwing: Prologue in Full Epilogue in Full Presentation of Fez All Line Officers should ‘be present. In the absence of any officer another may double for him. The cere - monies should be conducted in a dignified manner, all parts memorized and Fezzes should be worn by the officers taking part. Where possible the use of appropri - ate music is recommended. 69 =1"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"2 CEREMONY OF INSTITUTION ‘JZ’he Grand Monarch or his Special Deputy should ap - point a Marshal and Secretary to assist him in the Ceremony of Institution.

There is nothing that will serve to publicize theGrotto or build up good will in a community more than a properly conducted Public Installation of Officers. We suggest the use of the foregoing full form service with the following changes and additions: 1. Posting of the National Colors by the Patrol in uniform. 2. Entrance of the Installing Officer, Chaplain and Marshal, the Installing Officer and Chaplain pro - ceeding to the East and Marshal on floor to left of the East. Next follow the elected and appointed of - ficers who will stand in front of chairs near center of hall behind the Altar. (Note: For the Ceremonies of Installation we sug - gest that the hall be set up in the san~e arrange - ment as the Symbolic Lodge, the chairs, half of them along the South wall, and the other half along the North wall. To make the affair more impres - sive, we suggest also that an Altar with Bible thereon be placed in the center 8. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Installing Officer will rap three times. Invocation by the Chaplain at the Altar, with his hands on the open Bible. One rap to seat audience. Selection by choir or band Installing Officer states purpose of the meeting. Proceed with the installation according to the Rit - ual Be sure no Grotto signs are given during the installation. A nice custom is to have the retiring Monarch act as Installing Officer and as such he may turn over the gavel of authority to his successor in office with appropriate remarks to which the incoming Monarch may respond. (Note: If available within the Grotto, we recom - mend that appropriate musical nurpbers by the band or chorus be used at certain, points in the service. Soloists might also be used.) 91.

These suggestions, however, are not intended to absolutely bind all Grottoes in such a manner as to create a monotonous level. Qualities of materials, trim - mings and ornamentations are left largely to the possible means each Crotto may afford; the style in general, and the color schemes are here recommended, as it would not be advisable for anyone to depart too radically from the suggestions here given, sustained as they are by the best logical interpretations generally adopted by all writers and artists of the past and pres - ent, not forgetting the due leniency compatible in cos - tumes made for Grotto use. It would be a long, tedious task to try here to explain fully the various reasons why these costumes are so suggested, especially in dealing with characters sup - posed to represent in our ritualistic drama a serious and yet also grotesque picture, but here are the main reasons: 1 The production of them at reasonable cost. 2. The simplicity of construction, making possible a quick dressing at ceremonial sessions. 3. The presentation to the Prophets present, of a logical as well as amusing variety of characters form - ing pleasing tableaux, while the romantic, mythologi - cal drama of the order is displayed for their benefit and instruction With these points in view, these suggestions and in - formation are here offered in the sincere hope that they will be indulgently received by the workers, remember - ing always that they are given in the fraternal spirit of mutual help and goodfeilowship.

He proclaimed himself, according to the doctrine of Metempsychosis, or soul transmigration, commonly ac - cepted among many Oriental peoples, as the only true successor and interpreter of Mohammed; in fact, the very Divine F~ssence or Emwnation incarnated first in Adam, Noah, Abraham, Mose’s, Jesus, Mohammed and Abu-Moslem, last Prince of Khorassan. In his white standard he announced freedom to all the world, and preached the final triumph of mind over matter which was going to bring, to his faithful only, the earthly millenium or C olden Age. Thomas Moore’s poetical romance, “Lalla HookY’, gives some very interesting details about this personage, who was called “Mokanna” from the veil of silver gauze (or, as others say, golden) which he always wore to hide his features from public gaze (as the poem states.) I-ha main object, however, was to successfully carry the mysterious mummery of making his followers believe that it was a very dangerous thing to look upon his radiant face, n,ore luminous and resplendent than the countenance of Moses returned iroin Sinai with the Law ‘fablets, upon whose (IuIs/ling brow the people could not stiffer themselves to gaze, and Aaron, his brother, advised him to veil hIs ‘face until the tempo - rary divine effulgency should ulowly have waned from his f4ce.

Of course, the design and decoration of the Shrine should be in harmony with the setting of each particu - lar Grotto’s Court of Mokanna scene, therefore there is n6 absolutely set requirement respecting the design to be followed in its construction. It should be so constructed that, while it is light and easily moved and set, it should stand firm, be high enough to show the Glowing Heart and the words “Goodfellowship” well above the heads of the cast on the stage, so that the words, at least, will be clearly visible to the audience. The framework of the Shrine can be of simple straight-line design and may be covered with canvas wnd painted and gilded so as 1o produce the proper orna - mental effect. The wiring must be in two circuits, one to light the Glowing Heart and the other so arranged that when the casket is placed in position the words “Goodfellowship” will shine above the hearth. The lighting sPystom for the Shrine can be so elabo - rated that the placing of the casket will transform the Shrine into a wonderfu]ly beautiful setting of many colored jewels for the Priceless Jewel Goodfellowship, and thus add to the inipress~veness of the climax. The top of the base of the Shrine, which forms the shelf on which the casket is placed, should be nearly four feet up from the Eloor, and the back, which forms the panel on which the Heart and Words are shown, should go as high as the stage will permit, so that they may be seen from every seat in the auditorium. The width of the Shrine should be in proportion to H the height whenever stage space will permit, but in any event it should be wide enough to give space long enough to spell out the words in large letters. The shelf does not require to be more than 12 inches; less will give space enough for the casket. Goodfellowship is the ideal for which the M. 0. V P. E. R. stands. That ideal breathed the breath of life into the Order; that ideal gave it a mission and a purpose which makes it worthy of continued life, and so long as the Order cherishes that ideal it will live and prosper in its mission. The Shrine of the Glowing Heart of Goodfellowship is an instrumentality through which we are enabled to beautifully and impressively exalt this life-giving ideal in the climax which closss our grand ceremonial. 108 109"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"ALTERNATE CEREMONIAL ~r4t!1~Oe4 SUPREME COUNCIL Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets Of The Enchanted Realm —1966—"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"k Written by: Milton Newman, P.M.

PREFACE TO THE CONDENSED CEREMONIAL - The condensed version of our ceremonial story was created in order to ease the problems that con - front many Grottoes in the performance of a suit - able ceremonial. It was not written with the intention of replacing our present long form ritual. Those Grottoes that have the stage facilities and the cast may continue using the present ritual if they wish. Many Grottoes have had difficulty with the long form ritual for reasons beyond their control. There are 93 Grottoes with less than 150 members. Some reasons are as follows: Inadequate stage facilities or none at all. Some of the smaller Grottoes cannot recruit enough actors to portray all of the characters. These same Grot - toes have trouble ohtaining stage crews to make changes for the seven scenes. Adequate changes of scenery require a greater capital outlay than some Grottoes can afford. The cost of maintenance, re - pair and storage of scenery and costumes, is costly. The element of time is also to be considered since many Grottoes have a limited time to present both the drama and the second section in one evening. The condensed ceremonial was designed to over - come the problems mentioned above, as well as many more. The advantages are: It can be performed either on stage, or on floor level in front of the audience, or in the round on a Lodge floor. There are two simple stage settings for the four acts that can be handled by one stage hand. It can be performed with a minimum of seven actors and will require thirty minutes to portray. In this day when television gets the story across in thirty minutes to a ffiaximum of one hour, we should consider this short ceremonial fav - orably. The story remains the same and it is written in modern English to facilitate better understanding and delivery. Many agree that Units make the Grotto and, with this ceremonial, even the smallest Grotto can organize a Cast Unit to portray their own show. 113"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"F List of Properties Necessary for Putting on the Condensed Ceremonial: Platform (to place under throne).

We will present it to you translated from the ancient Persian to modem day English. A brief exploration into the life of Mokanna re - veals that he had been afflicted very badly with the dread disease known as the Black Smallpox. As a result he wore a veil to hide his horribly scarred face, and in addition, it added to the mysticism surrounding him, which he encouraged. A.mong the things that the Prophet Mokanna was most noted for was the revolt he headed against the despotic rule ef the Caliph of Khorassan for the purpose of allowing greater freedom and to promote Good Fellowship. For those who wished to join his ranks it was re - quired that they undertake a long and perilous series of trials to prove their worthiness before being accepted. And now let us see how worthy you are! We go now to the Court of the Veiled Prophet M okanna. (Curtain rises on ACT 1) ACT 1 COURT OF MOKANNA SARPEDON: Oh Mighty Mokanna! (Bows) These Neophytes have come to your presence to vow obedience to your laws and learn of its mys - teries. They hope that by doing so they may acquire the Priceless Jewel of the Enchanted Realm. 114 115"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MOKANNA: Neophytes, I greet you. Welcome to our glorious kingdom. From now on you are bound to my serv - ice; however, before you can be accepted into the joys of the Realm, you must prove yourselves worthy to be one of us. You will be tested in maiiy ways, and you will be subjected to trials that will wring your very souls. It is hoped you will not fail for the possession of the Priceless Jewel of the Enchanted Realm is worth more than the greatest treasure. If you suc - ceed, the reward is a lasting one and not one that is easily lost. Are you ready to endure the test to prove your woithi ness? NEOPI lYTI~S I am.

You will encounter loneli - ness, terror, torment, and even hell itself, and it is hoped that your desire to obtain the Priceless Jewel of the Enchanted Realm will be strong enough to overcome your almost insurmountable perils. As an aid to help you through the rigors and ordeals, and as a charm to shield you from harm and fatal dangers, place this amulet around your neck. Also, take this scroll with you. It, too, may help. You are now ready to start your journey. Sar - pedon will conduct you to the center of the Haunted Forest. When you arrive there you will be left alone. At first you will ponder your fate. Later melancholy thoughts will dominate your mind, after which the utter hopelessness of your plight will plunge you into despair. In fear of what seems to be your inevitable doom you will panic and in a frenzy to escape, will follow many paths which lead to nowhere except to Hades. Go now Sarpedon. Tahe the Neophyte to the deep center of the dismal Haunted Forest. GO!

CURTAIN RISES ON CALDRON SCENE—ACT 2 This scene is located in the throne room of his Majesty, wherein there is a caldron in which sup - posedly a mortal is being burned.

Neophyte, do you think you have the fortitude to find it? Ha, Ha! (Majesty now gets serious). Neophyte, you are now in the Realm of Shades. From here you must go alone in the dark to the bank of the poisonous river Styx. From there you will be ferried across the angry flood at a point just above the awful whirlpool, by old Charon him - self. You’ll need all the courage and strength you can muster. If and when you are successful in crossing the awful river, your path will be over a rough and rocky way, all slippery w~tli the slime of decayed bodies of those who perished before you.

A misstep on one side of your slippery path flow the mad waters of the venomous river; on the other side, a frightful chasm already paved with the crumbling bones of other victims. Neophyte, do you still persist in your quest? In your heart do you feel your goal, if you attain it, is worth the torment and danger you face?
