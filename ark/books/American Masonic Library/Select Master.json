But I beg Your Majesty to believe that it was not curiosity or disobedienc e that led me hither, but fervor and zeal in Your Majesty’s service. HKT Illustrious King Solomon, if this be tr ue, Zabud is not guilty of the charge alleged against him. His offense was owing to an unguarded explanation of your own. He ought to be pardoned and admitted one of our Select Masters. SKI My worthy companion of Tyre, how can that be? Is not our number full?

To avert so dire a calamity from the Craft and Jewish people, He has enjoined upon us in His Word to deposit those sacred treasures, which the people most revere, in a secret and secure place, for He has promised us that in three score and ten years, He will restore this people to the land which they now inhabit, and He will put it into the heart of a Prince of the House of Judah to rebuild the Temple to His Holy Name, and He will give him a sign as a reward and encouragement for his zeal and fidelity, and the sign shall be the recovery of the Word..

And Moses said unto Aaron, take a pot and put an omer full of m anna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. As the Lor d commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the testimony, to be kept.” SKI hands pot of manna to HKT, and he to HA, who deposits it in the Ark, after HKT has lifted the lid. SKI reads Numbers XVII: 10: “And the Lord said unto Moses, bring Aaron’ s rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token.” Deposit made as before. SKI reads Deut. XXXI:24-26: “And it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying, “Take this Book of the Law, and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.” SKI takes a key and places it in the Book, saying: Within the Book of the Law, we will place a Key to the Characters upon the Ark. Deposit is made as before. We will now deposit on the top of the Ark, this triangle containing the Master’s Word or Great and Sacred Name. Done. And that it may be known that this Ark contains treasures belonging to the craft, we will plac e our three squares on the sides of the triangle.

"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Se lect Ma ster     9   4/15/2003 Lec In giving the history of this degree, we revert to the building of the Temple, Our three Grand Masters, Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff, being in possession of the writings of Moses and the Prophets, well knew that if the Children of Israel deviated from the laws therein contained, their enemies would be let loose upon them, their cities and Temple sacked and destroyed and all the Sacred Treasures in the Sanctum Sanctoru m would be forever lost. In order to prevent this evil, they agreed to erect a secret vault under ground leading from King Solomon’s most retired apartment and ending under the Sanctum Sanctorum or Holy of Holies. This secret vault was divided into nine ar ches or apartments. The ninth Arch was erected by our three Grand Masters as a pl ace wherein to deposit a true copy of all the Holy Vessels and Sacred Treasures c ontain in the Sanctum Sanctorum above; also to meet in Grand Council to confer the Master Mason degree when the Temple should be completed. There were employed on the other eight Arches, twenty-two men from Gebal, a city of Phoenicia, toget her with Ahishar and Adoniram, all of whom were well skilled in the arts and sciences generally, but particularly in sculpture. Their hours of labor were from nine at night till tw elve, the time when prying eyes are closed in sleep. During the erection of this Vault, a circumstance occurred which characterized this degree, and upon which the ceremony of initiation is founded. One of King Solomon’s particular friends , whose name was Zabud, discovered that there was a secret work going on with wh ich he had not been made acquainted and for a long time he grieved in silence. At length be complained to King Solomon and received for an answer, “Be content, friend Zabud, the time will come when a door shall be open for your reception.” Meaning t hat when the Temple should be completed he should receive the Master Mason degree. This satisfied him. One evening, having some particular business with King Solomon, he went to his most retired room in search of him, and fi nding the door to the Secret Vault open, and not guarded, as usual by the Grand Steward, Ahishar, who was sleeping at his post, he took it for granted that it had been left open for his reception, whereupon he entered and was dealt with as you have already learned. When the ninth Arch was completed, our three Grand Masters deposited therein an exact imitation of the Ark of the Covenant, and placed within it an imitation of the Pot of Manna, and Aaron’s Rod, and also a true c opy of the Book of the Law, or all the writings of the Bible up to that period, and that it might be known by whom and for what purpose it was deposited, they placed on three sides of the Ark the initials of their names, and on the fourth, the time when, meaning, “Deposited in the year of light 3000, by Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, Ki ng of Tyre and Hiram Abiff, for the benefit of the Craft in general, but t he Jewish nation in particular.” The Master’s Word was placed on the top of the Ark, engraved on a triangular plate of gold, on the sides of which, in certain mysterious characters were engraved the Key or cover words by which the Master’s Word may be revealed. A key to these characters"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Se lect Ma ster     10   4/15/2003 was placed inside the Ark in the Book of t he Law, so that if the Children of Israel should ever be carried into captivity, and rema in so long as to forget their mother tongue, yet on their return, if found, by means of this Key, the Word might be restored; and that it might be known and distinguished as the Master’s Word when found they placed on the top of the Ark their three Jewels, one on each side of the triangle, knowing that a description thereof would be handed down to the latest posterity. Thus was preserved the long lost Master’s Word , now the Grand Omnificent Word, or Great and Sacred Name, which Royal Arch tradition informs us was first communicated by God to Moses at the Burning Bush and remained in use until near the completion of King Solomon’s Temple. It was then lost at the death of our Grand Master Hiram Abiff, and lay buried in darkness 470 years, when, as you are aware, at the building of the Second Temple after the Babylonish captivity, through the merits of Jeshua, Zerubbabel, and Haggai, it was again restored to the Craft, in whose possession we trust it may forever remain. APR I now present you with the Apron of a Se lect Master. Its color is white bordered in purple. The white is Ancient Masonry’s final reminder of that purity of life symbolized in the first Apron you received as an Entered Apprentice; while the purple, the color of kings, exhorts us to rule will our own lives that we may be numbered with the select nobility who truly practice our Royal Art. The Sword designates us as guardians, whos e particular duty is the preservation of those sacred treasures which are ours through Masonic heritage. The Trowel reminds us that we are builders, and that our lives should be constructive in their influence upon the Brotherhood and upon the world. The Broken Triangle speaks to us of mortality – of the uncertainty of our tenure of life, of the importance of an industrious use of our time and our faculties, and of the place of wages, refreshment and rest which awaits our entrance through the gate of Death. Enclosing this emblem of our mortal life is the Unbroken Triangle, emblematic of Deity whose love enfolds us all, whose justice and mercy are alike infinite and alike perfect, and whose Word points the way of life immortal.
