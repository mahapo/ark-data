The response was overwhelming. As a result of that invitation, we soon printed five new books, including two interesting rituals; but we never anticipated the reception of the material which is now printed here for the first time ever. A reader from upstate New York informed us that his family owned a set of Masonic manuscript rituals which had been its possession since the 1830’s. What makes this more remarkable is that neither the corespondent nor any member of the immediate family belongs to the Masonic fraternity. Intrigued, we traveled upstate to meet with our corespondent and examine the documents first hand. The manuscript collection consists of five leather-bound books (of various sizes), numerous loose pages of “detached degrees” and several letters. Each of the leather-bound books is signed by the original transcriber. Inside the first volume, the ancestor of our corespondent penned the following: These M.S.S. was Purchasd of Mr. [name withheldj, a renouncing & Seceeding Free Mason for $45— & one new Pack & Shoval—this 22 d Day of December 1835. There is nothing Hid but what shall be Seen & known. At the request of the present owners we have withheld both the name of the original transcriber and their ancestor, as the crwners have no desire to part with their heirloom. They wish to make it emphatically clear that they do not wish to be bothered in any way as a result of this publication. Poemandres Press has been requested by the family to protect their pri vacy, and cannot respond to any requests for information regarding the present owners, or the ritual collection itself vi"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"II Table of Contents Be that as it may, the manuscripts are a veritable gold-mine of Masonic information, for they constitute, as far as we are aware, the most complete set of early Scottish Rite rituals in the United Stares. The reader will note that each of the five books was transcribed from rituals belonging to Giles F. Yates, 33¶ Mr. Yates was a member of both the Northern and Southern Supreme Councils, and by 1827 was in possession of most, if not all, of the manuscript rituals of Mr. Frederick Dalcho, one of the founders of the first Supreme Council. 1 At one point the original Dalcho manuscripts (“a strange farrago of bad English”) 2 were lost or sold. When the collection was rediscovered in 1938, it had several rituals missing. 3 Our collection includes all the rituals from the 40 SECRET MASTER, up to and including the 330 SOVEREIGN GRAND INSPECTOR GENERAL 4 Each of the rituals is preceded by a header which frequently gives the dates 1801 and 1802. We believe this indicates the rituals are copies of the Dalcho versions, although we have not had the opportunity to compare them with the originals in the archives of the Northern Jurisdiction, at Boston. It should be noted that for some unknown reason the rituals are divided into two groups, i.e., “first series” and “second series.” The “second series” rituals are all dated after 1804, which may indicate that some type of reconstruction took place. Further, some of the rituals have apparently been switched around in numerical order. Among the more curious instances of revision is the 290 GRAND MASTER ECOS~, OR SCOTrISH ELDER MASTER, AND KNIGHT OF ST. ANDREW. Following the degree (which closely follows the Pike’s version) 5 is the outline 1 R.

Did Pike have this l8O6ritual? Consider the 30TH, 31ST AND 32ND DEGREE, SOVEREIGN, OR SUBUME PRINCE OF THE ROYAL SECRET, which seems to have become the 320 only after a 310 TRIBUNAL OF GRAND INQUISITORS appears in 1804. And then, twenty-three years later, the latter is itself drastically revised. One of the most interesting rituals is the 330 SOVEREIGN GRAND INSPECTOR GENERAL Not only is it the earliest form of this degree, but it includes a copy of a “Letter of Credence” (Patent) and an early version of the Constitutions, Statutes and Regulations. In editing the manuscripts, we have corrected the spelling in many instances (e.g. sholdizers to shoulders, etc.), but tried to retain as much of the original format as possible. Interlineations have been introduced at the points indicated without indication, and several marginal notations have been eliminated, as they are not in the original writer’s hand. Finally, all hand-drawn illustrations in this book, including the Masonic alphabets, were scanned from photocopies of the original manuscripts. 6 We have enhanced and cleaned these up as best we could, and are satisfied with the results. We regret that all of the original illustrations could not be used, but the manuscripts had apparently sustained some water damage many years ago and are barely legible on several pages. In these instances we have reconstructed the original drawings using a computer graphics program. 6 By agreement with the owners, we were not permitted to retain photocopies of any document, once scanned and edited. viii"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"XI"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A ~ZZ BOOK 1St Copied from that of IlltrS Brother Giles F.

Form of Reception. The Blue Past Master or Candidate, must be examined in the Ante-chamber (by the Master of Ceremonies) in his three first Degrees, and in the secrets of the Chair. The Master of Ceremonies having finished, he knocks 7 times on the door, when he is let in and gives an account of the examination to Adoniram, the Inspector, who reports it to the Most Powerful in the following words. “Most Powerful, there is in the Antechamber a Past-Master who solicits the honor of being initiated into the mysteries of the Sublime Grand Lodge of Perfect Masons.” The Most Powerful desires the Candidate to be introduced in the ancient form, if the Inspector will answer for his capacity, zeal and constancy. If the Inspector consents to do so, the Candidate is introduced having his head bound, as if blinded, as square upon his forehead and a Great Light in his hand, and conducted to Adoniram, to whom he must give an account of himseff — Conducted by Adoniram, he advances, then, near the altar, falls on his right knee, and while in this position, the Most Powerful delivers the usual address, and concludes thus, “My Dear Brother, you have seen until now, the thick veil, only, which covers the Sanctum Sanctorum your fidelity, zeal and constancy have gained you the favor which I now grant you. It is to show you the great treasure, and introduce you, in due time, into the holy and secret place. Come and contract your obligation.” Adoniram raises him and leads him to the foot of the altar, where he kneels and takes the obligation of a blue Master with this addition— “And I do furthermore promise and swear, that I will not reveal to any person below me this Degree; that I will be an exact observer of all such laws as 5"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Secret Master u... shall be prescribed to me, and will fulfill and obey all orders and decrees from the Grand Council of princes of Jerusalem and the laws and regulations of this Sublime Grand Lodge; under the penalty of all my former obligations—So help me God, and keep me steadfast in the same.

Adoniram now raises him, and the Most Powerful invests him with the ribbon, key and apron; places on his head a crown (or wreathe) of laurel and olive leaves, and says to him, “My Dear Brother, I receive you Secret Master, and give you rank among the Levites. This Laurel, which I have invested you with, alludes to the victoty which you are to gain over your passions. The Olive is the symbol of that peace and Union which should reign among us. It rests with you to desire the fervor that God may, one day, enable you to arrive at the Secret place; and there to contemplate the pillar of Beauty.

Mahabon, one of Solomon’s Intendants was highly esteemed by him, he was an upright, virtuous man, and a great friend of our deceased Master Hiram Abiff. This man, King Solomon employed, with others, to search for the body of his friend, who was supposed to have been murdered, from the blood which was seen in the Temple. He was also desired to discover the assassins, and the Masters Jewel which Hiram Abiff used to wear. The blood was traced to a well on the North side of the Temple, which induced Mababon to believe that the body had been thrown into it The immediately discharged the water from the well and he descended, but found not the body as he expected, however, they were richly rewarded for their labor by finding the Master’s Jewel, which in all probability, when Hiram Abiff was attacked by the assassins, he tore from his neck and threw there, to prevent it from falling into their hands. Mahabon, with his companions, offered a prayer of thanksgiving to the Almighty, for the discovery of this treasure. They then went in search of the body, which was at length discovered by Stokin, by means of a sprig of Acasia., as is mentioned in the symbolic Degrees. When the body was brought to the temple, Solomon was highly gratified to be able to pay to the memory of that great Man, those high, Masonic, honors, which his talents and virtue so justly entitled him to. He accordingly gave orders to the Noble Adoniram, his Grand Inspector, to make the funeral as magnificent as possible. He also gave orders that the blood which was spilled in the Temple should not be effaced, until revenge should be obtained. The Noble Adoniram, Grand Master Architect and Chief of the Works, immediately gave the plan for a superb monument, which was to be raised to his mourning, and which, was to be composed of black Marble. Through the exertions of the workmen, the monument was finished in nine days. On the top thereof, was a triangular stone, on which was engraved M.B. in Hebraic characters, and a sprig of Acacia ornamented the top. 20 L"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"7 _______________________________________________________________ .-.,w Perfect Master It was erected in the middle of a great hail, in an apartment, separate from the Temple, where Solomon kept his chapter. and conferred with Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff on the sacred mysteries.

His heart was enclosed in an Urn pierced through with a sword, which was placed on the top of a superb obelisk, erected near the West part of the Temple, a little to the North side. The Jewel of Hiram Abiff was carefully deposited among the treasures of the Temple. Three days after the ceremony, Solomon, with his whole court, went to the Temple, where the workmen were arranged in the same order, as they were at the funeral. He examined the tomb, obelisk, the triangular stone with the letters which were engraved on it, when he raised his eyes and hands towards heaven and offered up a prayer to the Lord of Hosts, and said with joy in his heart, it is complete, and by a Sign of Admiration the Brethren raised their eyes and hands towards heaven, leaned their heads on their right shoulders, and then crossed their bands over their bellies, said Amen.

Solomon, having neglected this for a year, King Hiram visited the Cities, and finding the lands barren, the people rude and uncultivated, and their morals bad, he was convinced they would be more expense than profit to him, he therefore determined to go in person to Solomon and complain of his breach of the promise and agreement which he had made. Being arrived at Jerusalem, he passed through the Guards who were in the court, and proceeded directly to the kings Apartment, where he found Solomon, giving himself up to grief for the loss of Hiram Abiff. King Hiram went in, in so hasty a manner, that one of Solomon’s favorites named Joabert, who perceived it, fearing he had gone ion with an intention of executing some evil design against Solomon, followed him to the door and listened. Hiram perceiving it, exclaimed, Oh Heavens they hear us! and ran immediately to the door and dragged him into the chamber and said, here he is. Solomon seeing him, could not doubt and said, what shall we do with him? to which Hiram replied, we must kill him, and seized his sword for that purpose, when Solomon ran from his throne and said, stop your hand my Brother. He then gave a loud knock on the table, on which the guards entered, to whom he said, seize this guilty man, withdraw with him, you will answer for his appearance. When Solomon was alone with Hiram he said, Sire, Joabert is the greatest favorite I have, and of all the Lords in my Court, he is the most attached to me.

Sometime after the death of Hiram Abiff (whose murderers, Solomon was unable to discover) there was an assembly of a great number of Masters, who sat in consultation, on the means of discovering the Assassins of Hiram Abiff whose loss is the constant object of Grief, of all the Knights and Princes of Masons. The Captain of the Guards interrupted their deliberations by announcing that, there was a stranger who demanded to speak with the King in private, and who declared that he knew where the traitor JUBULUM AKIROP, one of the Assassins, had secreted himself, and offered to conduct those whom the King would appoint to go with him. On which all the Brethren desired permission to take ample vengeance for the death of the beloved Chief. Solomon put a stop to their zeal by saying, there should be only 9 to undertake the task, and their names to be wrote and put in an urn, and the first nine that should be drawn from thence, should be the persons elected to proceed in company with the stranger, to seize the Traitor, and when taken, to bring him to his presence, in order to make a memorable example of him. In short, Joabert and Stokin with seven others, departed at night fall with the stranger, and traveled through many difficult and dangerous roads, when the stranger acquainted Joabert that the Cavern which held this detestable wretch was situated by the sea side, on the coast of Joppa, on which Joabert increased his pace with the most ardent zeal and being before his companions, he entered the cavern alone, and by light of a Lamp, discovered the Traitor a sleep, with a pomard at his feet, which, Joabert immediately seized, and stabbed the Traitor with on the head and the heart, who had only time to pronounce NECUM or NECAH, signifying VENGEANCE IS DONE, when he died. Immediately after Joabert had done this, he perceived a spring of which he drank, and being fatigued. he slept until the other Brethren came and awake him, and when they perceived the head of the Traitor daubed with blood, they all exclaimed NECuM, Vengeance is done. When Joabert acquainted them with what had happened, they all envied him the Glory, of having alone, revenged the death of their venerable Chief Hiram 62"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Elected Knights ~.. Abiff and having refreshed themselves at the fountain Joabert cut off the head, and divided the body into four parts, which were burnt and the ashes thrown into the air. After this, Joabert took the head in his left hand and the poniard in his right, and exclaimed VENGEANCE. They proceeded to Jerusalem where they arrived at day break, and when Solomon saw Joabert, with the head of the Traitor in his hands, he was exceeding wrathful, that he should be deprived of inflicting an exemplaiy punishment himself, and that the power of acting, should be thus taken from him, immediately gave orders to Stokin to put him to death for his presumption; but the Brethren being convinced that it was the zeal of Joabert and not an intention of offending, fell on their knees, and begged his life, which at their intercession was granted him a second time. Solomon ordered the head of the Traitor to be fixed on the East pinnacle, until the other two accomplices should be found. Solomon honored with his most Intimate confidence, and gave him, with the eight other Brethren, the title of Elected Knights. and also gave them the following signs, token and words. §.

Q. Which are the Sciences that a perfect Master Architecture ought to possess? A. There are several which have a connection with each other, and cannot be dispensed with, if you wish to exercise Architecture in all its branches. Thus a Grand Master Architect ought to possess the following— viZt. 1St Arithmetic lith Hydraulics 2~ Geometry 12 th Geography 3’~ Trigonometry 13 th Chronology 4~ Optics 1 4th Cutting of Stone 5 th Catoptncs 15d1 Cutting of Wood 6 dI Dioptncks 16 dI Measure ~ Designing 17 th Physics 8 th Perspective l8~’ Music 9 th Mechanics 19 th 10 th Statics Q. What is Arithmetic, and in what manner does it serve a Mason? A. It is the art of calculating, and is called Arabe, because the characters we make use of, come to us from the Arabians—and what we call Algebra, is also Arithmetic, but greatly abridged, and is not much likes, particularly by those who are not Masters of it, but those who have a perfect knowledge of it, delight in the use of it, as it affords the means of finding the incomprehensible quantities, unknown proportions and their roots, with much more case, and in short, to resolve by a little work, all the problems of Geometry. The Algebraic characteristics are + = V A more, less, equal. greater, smaller, &c. You may make use of the first letters of the Alphabet for the known quantities, and the 93"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"...w Grand Master Architect v.... last for the unknown, Arithmetic is the attribute of a good Mason, because it teaches him to multiply his benevolence and knowledge to all his Brethren and to look upon any recompense, as a cipher of Arithmetic, as he had only discharged a duty he owed to himself in doing a good action. Q. What is Geometry, and why is that science an attribute to Masons? A. Geometry is the first of the Sciences, founded on the preceding one, it came from the Egyptians, who were much embarrassed in the bounds of their lands, after every inundation of the River Nile. from which circumstance was suggested the discovery of Measure and limits, upon just and given principles, whereby they might ascertain their respective bounds, when the waters subsided. This art was called by the Greeks Geometras, or measure of land, so that geometry is the art of measuring land, on the surface or superfices but not solids, but from this is derived the art of measuring solids, having several superfices. That is to say, Height and depth. Geometry is an attribute of a good Mason, as he ought continually to measure his actions with the line of Justice, to circumscribe his desires by the bounds or reason, and be content with his portion of property, and not infringe on that of neighbor, that he may render Glory to the Grand Architect of the Universe, and be an example of virtue to his Brethren. Q. Is Trigonometry also necessary, and is it an attribute of Masonry? A. Yes, Grand Architect, this sciences is inseparable from the preceding, by it we measure angles, Tangents and secants, and by a knowledge of Triangles we find the ineffable measure of the unknown sides, Arithmetic and Algebra. The discovery of this art, we owe to Pythagoras. The most essential explanation of the problems of Trigonometry, are cited in the ~ proposition of Euclid. This learned philosopher, sacrificed one hundred Oxen to the Gods, in acknowledgment of the discovery, he would have deserved applause among the Masons, if he had not been an Idolater. Trigonometry is rather an attribute belonging to the Grand Architect of the Universe; than to a Mason. All our actions put in signs, will form a triangle, of which two sides only will present 94"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":".,‘ Grand Master Architect -~ themselves to our conscience, viz the Good and Evil but the Grand Architect of the Universe will find the other, and judge us in the aggregate. Q. Of what do the Sciences of Opticks, Catoptrics, and Dioptrics treat, and how are they attributes of Masonry? A. They treat of the reflection and refraction of the rays of light, and of the Science of Vision generally, both natural and artificial. They are attributes to masons, because every man should look at his own faults, with glasses which enlarge the object, and in viewing the faults of his Brothers, he should use glasses, which diminish and remove them. Q. We know what drawing or designing is, but how are they likewise attributes of Masonry? A. As the most perfect design, has been began by a sketch, so should Masons when they find any good qualities in a Brother, acknowledge him as a sketch. After which they should copy, and complete the picture of perfection. By imitating, the actions of a virtuous Brother, you render him honor, and yourself respectable. Q. What is perspective, and how an attnbute of Masonry? A. perspective is the art of delineating objects in accurate proportion and color. So should Masons, setting out from the point of Virtue, observe a relative proportion and connection in all their actions and pursuits. As in a well drawn perspective, let their conduct in the foreground of their lives, be brilliant in the cause of Virtue, and as they retreat into the background of the piece, or sink into the gulf of time, the sweet recollection of a well spent life, will soften the pillow of death, and give them the sweet pledge of enjoying happiness hereafter. Q. Let us go to Mechanics— A. Mechamcs is the science of motion, or the art of Machinery, by which we carry and raise to the most elevated places, burdens of great weight, with little seeming strength and by the aid of few people, by Levers, Vices, Rollers. Cranes &c. — By this art is constructed Mills, Clocks, Jacks &c. which receive motion by wheels, springs, weights &c. The great spring of a Mason, is in the 95"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Grand Master Architect ~‘- heart. Here the first causes of his actions rise, and here the first impulse of his morals are felt. If he is so fortunate as to make Virtue the primum mobile of his pursuits, and adjusts with nice proportion, the equilibrium of his weights, and gives a due impulse to his moving powers. He may expect to receive that happiness which the Grand Architect of the Universe has promised to those who shall deserve it. Q. Of what use is statics to Masons? A. Statics has a connection with the science of mechanics, and is the knowledge of weights and moving forces, the art of steelyards and balances &c. The judgment of a Mason, should be preserved in so just an equilibrium, that no consideration of Interest or parry spirit can make him deviate from Equity and Justice. Q. What is Hydraulics and of what use to Masons? A. It is the art of conducting, goveming and draining water, necessary for the health and life of our fellow creatures, as well as for the purposes of Commerce, and to embellish palaces, gardens, &c. which a professor of this art conducts scientifically, through canals or pipes, and collect it, in Basins or Reservoirs for the several purposes for which he wants it. An Architect knows how to drain by canals, fields or meadows for Agriculture, and by cutting canals through the highest mountains, is enabled to connect together remote seas, for the purposes of Commerce and Navigation. In short by the use of Hydraulics we can convert into a place of elegance and pleasure, mud pool or a desert. The minds of Masons should be as brilliant canals, flowing with sweetness and ease, and not as remote seas separated by mountains, like two Brothers, whose affections are sometimes divided by misrepresentations, jarring interests or by the follies of youth— ‘till some Mediator, generally, penetrates and divides the obstacles which separate them, and unites them together in the firm bond of reciprocal affection. Q. What is Geography, and of what use to a Mason? A. Geography is the knowledge and description of the Earth, comprising every place by Land or Sea, inhabited or uninhabited, of capital cites and 96"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Grand Master Architect ~ inferior towns and villages, of every Kingdom and nation, of the rivers which water them, and of the seas which wash their shores; of the mountains which separate them, and in short of every thing which you see delineated on the face of a map or on the Terrestrial Globe. Though Masonry is the same in every part of the Earth, yet there are many Temples in divers places, where Masons Assemble to work at their mysteries, under the same statutes, and to sing the praises of the Eternal God. These Temples we call Lodges and Chapters, and a good Mason should possess a knowledge of Geography, that he may know where the different Lodges are held, that he may be able to correspond with them, to improve himself by their labor and talents, and render them the honor due to their merit. Q. Do you know Chronology in the number of indispensable sciences to an Architect Mason? A. Chronology being the science and knowledge of past events. A Mason should be possessed of it, that he may be ready to name those Masons, who have distinguished themselves since the Creation of the World; of Kings, Princes and Pontiffs, and all those in power who have supported Masonry, with honor to the Craft, and reputation to themselves, the various events and revolutions which Masonry has undergone, which should serve as a lesson to our patience, constancy and Resolution. Q. What do you mean by cutting in Stone? A. I mean the most essential science to a Mason, which is the art of describing by means of the square, all the stones which are to compose and edifice, so that when the workmen begin to lay them, they will be found, exactly to correspond, and require no alteration. No man, in any academy in the world, can attain the knowledge and conduction of an Architect, if he has not, himself, cut, dressed and fixed his stones. Thus in the Royal Art of Masonry, no Brother can attain the eminent Degree of Grand Master Architect, who has not disposed his heart to the cause of Virtue, and becomes himself one of the materials in the edification of the Temple, dedicated to the only true and living God. I 97"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Grand Master Architect i’.-. Q. What do you mean by cutting in wood? A. The only difference between cutting in stone and in wood, is in the materials. The timber should be ready prepared before it is brought into the edifice, that when they are going to use it. They will find the pieces correspond, and the points exactly adapted to each other. So should a Mason, in the right propriety of his conduct towards a Brother, endear himself to his affections, which forms the junction of Masons. The exactness and unanimity of their deliberations, the brightness of their works, and their sweet and innocent pleasures should always be in unison. Q. What is measure? A. As an Architect is always to be the Judge of Masons, he ought to know, by measuring their works, what pay is due to them for their labor—he must also measure the materials, to pay the provider agreeably to the quantity, and no Intendant of the Building can pay a farthing, but by order of a Grand Master Architect. For that reason, a Mason, who has attained by his knowledge, the measure in hand, should view it, as the center of Justice and benevolence, and for the use of which, he must render an account to the Grand Architect of the Universe, who will judge him accordingly. Q. How can physic be of any use to a Grand Master Architect? A. That he may be able to determine on the salubrity of a place before he erects his buildings, to avoid muddy or marshy places or stagnant waters—and arrange the windows in such a manner, that they may receive those winds, which bear health upon their wings. A Mason also, should physically vanquish, the difficulties, which an inordinate stomach, oppose to his health, and if he should be of a weak habit of body, prudently to deprive himself of some pleasures, which are prejudicial to him, though not to others. Q. Of what use can Music be in Masonry and to an Architect? A. The knowledge of Music was very necessary to and Architect in the time of the Ancient Romans, in constructing Saloons, Rotunda’s and other places, in which was performed Vocal and instrumental music, for which reason, those Architects must have understood Music, as they placed Columns, vaults, 98"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"..* Grand Master Architect i’. - ceilings &c. and even brass vessels in some places to produce an echo, and increase the sound and harmony of the performance. But in the present day, those buildings are made less, which presents the necessity of increasing the I sound by art, the Ceilings are proportional to the extent of the rooms, by which the vibrations are kept at the required distance. Music is considered as an attribute of Masons, for as the harmony of the different sounds elevate the generous sentiments of the soul, so should concord reign among our Brethren, that by the sweet unison of friendship, the boisterous passions may be lulled and harmony reign throughout all the craft. Q. Are these all the sciences, which a Mason should be possessed of? A. Mathematics is a general term, by which one may comprehend, a great many other sciences, besides those, I have already given an account of. This term is also an attribute of a Mason, for when he says, he is Master of the Mathematics, it signifies, that he has a heart zealous in the cause of Masonry, and that, as he increases in knowledge, he will increase in Virtue. Q. How many orders of Architecture are there? A. There are 5; The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. Q. What difference is there in these orders? A. The Tuscan and Doric, are the most revealed, and the less adorned, the Corinthian and Composite, are the finest and most adorned, and the Ionic is more adorned than the 2 first, but less than the two last. — Q. Are there any other kinds of Architecture? A. An infinite number— Vizt —the Tostille, the Presstille, the DeEstille, the Lamphi prostile, the Pirintore &c. &c. and a vast many others. Q. On what depends the stile of building? A. On the proportion of the Columns, their distance according to their magnitude, the ornaments of niches, panels &c., in short, the standing rules of true Architecture must be adhered to, when raising a building, that it may appear elegant. Q. You have told me my Brother, that Naval and Military Architecture, are necessary attributes of a Mason, how can that be? 99"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"...w Grand Master Architect A. They both are attributes, because masons should work at Sea, as well as upon land for the promotion of the Royal Craft, and the relief of his Brethren, and in Military point of view, he should serve as a rampart for Masons who are attacked. Q. Did King Solomon possess a knowledge of the Science of Mathematics? A. Without doubt, since the Grand Architect of the Universe, was graciously pleased to give him that wisdom, for which he was called the wisest Kings, and especially as God had chosen him to build a Temple to his name. Q. What is the great attribute of a Grand Master Architect? A. It is a case of Mathematical Instruments, in a small compass, which contains all the instruments necessary for the various designs, an Architect may invent. Q. Explain these instruments and their uses to me? A. The simple compass serves to take dimensions, dividing lines in equal parts, denote parallels, to make sections of triangles, equiangular and equilateral, in short, it may be used in an infinite number of Mathematical problems, too long to enumerate, but its use is well known to Mathematicians, and being the principle instrument in Mathematics, it is worn as a Jewel, by the Grand Master of a Symbolic Lodge of Masters. There is another Compass with five points, of which one is moveable and may be altered as occasion requires. This Compass serves to draw circles or parts of Circles, the immovable point being always the point or Center. On different occasion you may use a pencil, a drawing pen or a roller, on the moveable point. The Compass of proportion, is a solid rule, and is an instrument of great importance to an Architect. It saves an infinite deal of trouble, as the calculations of every operation are marked on it. It is a general table in which you will find a scale of parts, the planes, the polygons, the chords of solids, the weights of metals and of bullets, with their sizes &c. &c. The line of equal parts serves to divide a line pursuant to a line given; the line of planes, to diminish or increase it to his mind. The line of polygons is to describe a circle, or regular polygon of such numbers of planes or angles; the solid lines, to increase or diminish a solid, according to a reason 100"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"..~‘ Grand Master Architect i’.-. given; the line, for metals to know the difference and proportion between six metals. The parallel rule and drawing pen are two instruments which must be used together, to draw a strait line which is also an attribute of Masons, as a Mason’s conduct should always be fair and strait, and his inclinations should coincide with his duty and be connected together as these two instruments. The protractor or Quadrate is generally is generally made of brass, and is used in opening of angles, to take their height, and to divide the roses of the simple Compass. This is the Jewel of a Perfect Master, which makes him who wear it, remember, never to make use of it on any occasion except he has a point of perfection in view.

My worthy Brethren, it is my intention at this time to give you a clearer account than you have yet been acquainted with, of Masonry; of which you at present barely know the elements. In doing this it will be necessary to explain to you some circumstances of very remote antiquity. Enoch, the son of Jared, was the sixth son in descent from Adam, and lived in the fear and love of his maker; God appeared to him in a vision, and thus deigned to speak to him: As thou art desirous to know my name, attend, and it shall be revealed unto thee. Upon this, a mountain seemed to rise to the heavens, and Enoch was transferred to the top thereof, where he beheld a triangular plate of gold, most brilliantly-enlightened, and upon which were some characters which he received a strict injunction never to pronounce. — Presently he seemed to be lowered perpendicularly into the bowels of the earth, through nine arches; in the ninth, or deepest of which, he saw the same brilliant plate which was shewn to him in the mountain. Enoch, being inspired by the Most High, and in commemoration of this wonderful vision, built a temple under ground, in the same spot where it was shewn to him, which like that consisted of nine arches, one above another; and dedicated the same to God. Methusaich, the son of Enoch, constructed the building without being acquainted with his father’s motives. This happened in that part of the world which was afterwards called the land of Canaan, and since known by the name of the Holy Land. Enoch, in imitation of what he had seen, caused a triangular plate of gold to be made, each side of which was a cubit long; he enriched it with the most precious stones, and encrusted the plate upon a stone of Agate, of the same form. He then engraved upon it the same ineffable characters which God had shewn to him, and placed it on a triangular pedestal of white marble, which he deposited in the ninth, or deepest arch. When Enoch’s temple was completed, he received the following command, viz.—”Make a door of stone, and let there be a ring of iron therein, by which it I i I 109"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"...‘~ Royal Arch v... may be occasionally raised; and let it be placed over the opening of the first arch, that the sacred matters enclosed therein may be preserved from the universal destruction now impending.” And he did so, and none but Enoch knew of the precious treasure which the arches contained; nor knew the right pronunciation of the great and sacred name mm. And behold the wickedness of mankind increased more, and became grievous in the sight of the Lord, and God threatened to destroy the whole world. Enoch perceiving that the knowledge of the arts was likely to be lost in the general destruction, and being desirous of preserving the principles of the sciences, for the posterity of those whom God should be pleased to spare, he built two great pillars on the top of the highest mountain, the one of brass, to withstand water, the other of marble, to withstand tire; and he engraved on the marble pillar, hieroglyphics, signifying that there was a most precious treasure concealed in the arches under ground, which he had dedicated to God. And he engraved on the pillar of brass the principles of he liberal arts, particularly of Masonry. Methuselah was the father of Lamech, who was the father of Noah, who was a pious and good man, and beloved by God. And the Lord spake unto Noah, saying, “Behold I will punish the sins of mankind with a general deluge; therefore build an Ark, capable of coraaiing thyself and family, as also a pair of every living creature upon earth, and those only shall be saved from the general destruction which I am about to inflict, for the iniquities of the people.”— And God gave unto Noah a plan by which the ark was to be constructed. Noah was one hundred years in building the ark; he was six hundred years old when it was finished, and his son Seth was ninety-nine. His father Laxneth had died a short time before, aged 777 years. There was not at this time any of the ancient patriarchs living, save Methuselah, the grand father of Noah, who was about 969 years old, and it is supposed that he perished in the general ruin. 110"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":".v Royal Arch The ark being finished, Noah, agreeable to the instructions he had received from the Most High, went into it with his family, and took with him such things as he was commanded. The flood took place in the year of the world 1656 and destroyed most of the superb monuments of antiquity. The marble pillar of Enoch fell in the general destruction; but by divine permission, the pillar of brass withstood the water, by which means the ancient state of the liberal arts, and particularly Masonry, has been handed down to us. We learn from holy writ, the history of succeeding times, till the Israelites became slaves to the Egyptians; from which bondage they were freed under the conduct of Moses. We also learn from the Annals deposited in the Archives of Scotland, that in a certain battle, the Ark of Alliance was lost in a forest and was happily recovered by the roaring of a Lion, who couched at the approach of the Israelites—and who had destroyed a number of the Egyptians who attempted to carry it away. — He had kept in his mouth the key of the Ark., and which he dropt at the approach of the High Priest, retiring to a distance without offering any violence to the chosen people. The sacred Bible also informs us, that Moses was beloved of God, and that the Most High, spoke to him on Mount Sinai, in the B.B. To Moses God communicated his divine law, written on tables of stone; with many promises of a renewed alliance. He also gave him the true pronunciation of his sacred Dame, which he told him should be found by some of his descendants, engraved upon a plate of gold. It was at this time that Moses replied “Who art thou?” and God said ~ is my true name, that is, I am that I am, a strong and Jealous God, Most mighty, Puissant.— God gave a strict command unto Moses, that no one should pronounce his sacred name; so that in process of time the true pronunciation was lost. The same divine history particularly informs us of the different movements of the Israelites, until they became possessed of the land of promise, and of the succeeding events until the divine Providence was pleased to give the scepter to 111"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"~“ Royal Arch David; who, though fully determined to build a temple to the Most High, could never begin it; that honor being reserved for his son. Solomon, being the wisest of Princes, had fully in remembrance the promise of God to Moses, that some of his descendants, in fullness of time, should discover his holy name; and his wisdom inspired him to believe, that this could not be accomplished until he had erected and consecrated a temple to the living God, in which he might deposit the precious treasures. Accordingly, Solomon began to build, in the fourth year of his reign, agreeably to a plan given to him by David his father, upon the ark of alliance. He chose a spot for this purpose, the most beautiful and healthy in all Jerusalem. In digging for a foundation they discovered the ruins of an ancient, edifice, amongst which they found a very considerable quantity of treasure, such as vases of gold and silver, urns, marble, porphyry, jasper and agate columns, with a number of precious stones. All the treasures were collected and carried to Solomon, who, upon deliberation, concluded them to be the ruins of some ancient temple erected bcfore the flood; and possibly to the service of idolatry; he therefore declined building in that spot, lest the worship of the Deity should be profaned by the place. He then made choice of another place where the Temple was erected. You have already been informed by the history of Masonry which you have, at different times received, and by the melancholy death of our much respected Master Hiram Abiff, that the Temple of Solomon was constructed by the Craft; but there are some particulars respecting it with which you have not yet been made acquainted. Solomon caused a Cavern to be built under the Temple, to which he gave the name of the SECRET VAULT. He erected in this vault a large pillar of white marble, to support the Sanctum Sanctorum and which by inspiration, he called the pillar of Beauty, from the beauty of the ark, which it sustained. There was a long, narrow descent, which led from the palace of Solomon to this vault, through nine arches, in regular succession; and to this place he used I 112"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Royal Arch to retire privately, in company with Hiram of Tyre and Hiram Abiff when they had occasion to enter upon things of a secret and important nature. There were none else then living, qualified to enter this sacred vault. The loss of Hiram Abiff disordered their system for a time, as two were not permitted to enter the vault, there being absolutely necessaly, and as they were consulting in what manner to supply his absence, application was made to them by some Intendants of the Building, Elected Knights, and Grand Master Architects, who well knew there was a secret place under the Temple, in which the King, &c. before-mentioned, used to meet, soliciting the honor of being admitted there; to whom Solomon replied with an open air “My Brethren, it cannot now be granted. God will permit you one day to arrive at the knowledge which you now solicit.” Some days after this circumstance. Solomon sent for the three Grand Master Architects, JOABERT, STOKIN, and GIBULUM, and directed them to go and search once more, amongst the Ancient ruins, where so much treasure had been already found, in hopes of discovering more. They accordingly departed, and one of them, namely Gibulwn, in working with the pick-axe amongst the rubbish, came to the large iron ring, which he immediately made known to his companions, who all concluded that it might lead to some curious discovery; and accordingly they worked with redoubled ardor, to clear away the earth around it, which, when they had done, they found it fixed in a large stone, perfectly square. With much difficulty they raised it, when the mouth of a deep and dismal cavern appeared. Gibulum proposed to them that he would descend. A rope was accordingly tied round his body, to facilitate his return—he told them, that when he shook the rope violently, they should immediately draw him up. He descended, and presently found himself in an arched vault, in the floor of which was a secret opening, through which he also descended, and in like manner through a third. Being now in the third vault, he found there was an opening for descending still farther, but being afraid to pursue his search, he gave a signal, and was hoisted up by his two companions. 113"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"-~ Royal Arch — He recounted to his companions what he had seen, and proposed to them to descend by turns, which they refused; upon this he determined to descend again, and told them, that through every arch he passed, he would gently shake the rope. In this manner he descended from arch to arch, until he was lowered into the sixth arch; when finding there was still another opening, his heart failed hint, and, giving the signal, he was again pulled up. He acquainted Joabert and Stokin with the particulars of his second descent, and now earnestly urged that one of them should go down, as he was very much fatigued; but, terrified at his relation, they both refused. Gibulum then receiving fresh courage, went down a third time, taking a lighted flambeau in his hand. When he had descended into the ninth arch, a parcel of stone & mortar suddenly fell in, and extinguished his light; and he was immediately struck with the sight of a triangular plate of gold, richly adorned with precious stones; the brilliancy of which struck him with admiration and astonishment, on which he made the Sign of Admiration, which was the same that Solomon and Hiram King of Tyre made to him, when he came first with his two companions, and requested to be admitted into the sublime degrees. Gibulum fell prostrate on his knees, with his right hand forming the sign of the Intimate Secretary, his left hand behind him, shaking the rope three times, his companions assisted him in re-ascending. Gibulum related to his two companions the whole astonishing scene he had been witness to; and they now being desirous of witnessing the discovery, all concluded to go down together, by means of a rope ladder, which they made on that occasion. When they had descended into the ninth arch, Joabert and Stokin were struck with admiration and astonishment, and prostrated themselves with Gibulum. When Joabert and Stokin had recovered themselves, they got up, and seeing Gibulum still prostrate, they went and raised him, and said HAMALACH GIBULUM, (which signifies, Gibulum is a good man, or, more properly, Gibulum is an Angel) we must help him. After recovering themselves they examined the plate more particularly, and found it was encrusted by an agate of a triangular form. They also observed certain characters engraved i 114"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Royal Arch thereon, of the meaning of which they were then ignorant; they therefore determined to carry the treasure to Solomon, and solicit the honor of being admitted to the knowledge of this sublime mystery. Early in the morning they arrived at the apartment of Solomon, who had the King of Tyre with him. To them they presented the precious treasure they had found. When the two Kings beheld it, they were struck with amazement, and made the same Sign of Admiration to the 3 Masters, as they had made in the ninth arch, and falling down on their knees, remained some time in ecstasy. Solomon recovering from his surprise & seeing the King of Tyre still on his knees, raised him and said HAMALACH GIBULUM. They then examined the sacred characters with attention, and immediately knew them to be rnrr, but would not explain them to the three Grand Master Architects. Solomon told them that God had bestowed upon them a particular favor, in having permitted them to discover the most precious jewels of Masonry; by which he seemed to intimate their election, and as a reward for their zeal, constancy & fidelity, he elected them Knights of the Ninth Arch, afterwards called The Royal Arch. He further promised them an explanation of the sacred and mysterious name and characters of the golden plate, when it should be fixed in the place designed for it; and that he would then confer on them the most sublime and mysterious degree of Royal Arch Masonry. Solomon then explained to them, how the promise of God, made to Noah, Moses and his father David, was now accomplished. That promise which assured them, that in fullness of time his name should be discovered, engraved upon a plate of gold; that they were bound to defend the sacred characters, and that they were not at liberty to pronounce the sacred name. The Kings informed the three Knights, that until that time they knew nothing of that word but by tradition, and that in the course of its being handed down, through a succession of ages, it had been much corrupted; but since they were now in possession of the true characters, he would soon give them the true pronunciation, to which honor they seemed to be so justly entitled, both on 115"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":".-“ Royal Arch -~ account of personal merit, as also being so particularly elected by the Almighty, to finish this great work. The sacred name of the Eternal God must never be pronounced; it must be lettered, & that with the greatest circumspection. From the corruption of the said name, springs the Juba of the Moors, the Jupiter of the Romans, and many others of a like nature. The true name is said to have been visible in the Temple, at the time St. Jerome flourished, written in the ancient Samaritan characters, and is still preserved in the hearts of sincere Masons. The two kings, accompanied by the three Knights, then took the sacred treasure, and descended by the private way, through nine arches, into the secret vault. They worked there together, and encrusted the golden plate upon the pedestal of the pillar of beauty, happy in being employed in so glorious a work. After having finished the work, they prostrated themselves before the Grand Architect of the Universe, paying him homage, adoration & praise for his signal decrees in their favor. The brilliancy of the plate and jewels were of themselves sufficient to give light to the place, and to make and mark the principal ages of Masonry, 3, 5, 7 and 9, which when multiplied by our well known calculation, makes 81, which will be more fully explained in our general instructions. The two Kings then changed the name of the place, from the SECRET to the SACRED vault; a place known only to the Grand Elect Perfect and Sublime Masons. It was now time to recompense the virtue of the three elected Masters and Knights of the Royal Arch, Joabert, Stokin and Gibulum; the two Kings gave the degree of Grand, Elect, Perfect, Master and Sublime Masons, explaining to them the sacred word engraved on the golden plate, that which was, and is, the name of the sacred Omnipotence. a pronunciation which has suffered much and been greatly corrupted.

The nine Knights of the Royal Arch tyled the nine Arches, which led to the sacred vault; the most ancient, stood in the Arch next the vault, and so on in regular progression; the youngest taking his station in the first Arch, which was near to the private apartment of Solomon.

These began to be extremely jealous of the pre-eminence shewn to the twenty-five brethren, for they often saw them 118"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":".v Royal Arch ~ I admitted to the apartment of the King, which was shut to them. They deputed therefore, a certain number to wait on King Solomon, with their compliments, to request that similar honors might be conferred on them. The King heard them with attention and with the most benign air imaginable, gave them for answer, that the twenty-five Masters were justly entitled to the honors conferred on them, for their unceasing ardor, and inviolable fidelity in the work that had been committed to them. Go, said he, in peace. God may one day permit, that you may be rewarded according to your deserts. Upon this, one of the deputies, by no means satisfied with this mild reply, turned round to his companions saying (with an unbecoming degree of warmth) what occasion have we for an higher degree? we know the word has been changed; we can travel as Masters and receive pay as such. Solomon was much moved at this, but would not rebuke them, but spoke in the following terms; The ancient members whom I have advanced to the degree of perfection, have in a particular manner deserved this favor from me. They have wrought hard in the ancient ruins, and although the undertaking was difficult and full of horror, they penetrated into the bowels of the earth, from whence they brought in immense treasure to enrich and beautify the temple of God; go in fear, wait with patience, & aspire to perfection by good works. The Deputies returned and made report of their reception to the Masters, who were assembled to hear it. These Masters, hasty and impatient, in their dispositions, and of consequence vexed at the refusal, determined, one and all, to go to the ancient ruins, and search under ground, with a view of arrogating the merit, so necessary for attaining their desires. Accordingly they departed next morning, and presently after their arrival, discovered the iron by means of which they raised the square stone, and found the entrance into the arches. They immediately prepared a ladder of ropes, and descended, with lighted flambeaux; but no sooner had the last descended, than the nine arches fell in upon them, and they were no more heard of. The Ancient Word that was corrupted was lost with them, no person having known it since. 119"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":".-~‘ Royal Arch -~ Solomon soon heard of this dreadful accident, and sent Joabert, Stokin and Gibulum to inform themselves more particularly of the matter. They accordingly departed at break of day, and upon their arrival, were perfectly astonished at the strange appearance of the place. There were no remains of the arches to be seen; nor could they learn, that one single person of all those who had descended, escaped the destruction. They examined the place with diligence, but found nothing of note, except a few pieces of marble, upon which were engraved certain hieroglyphics; these they carried back with them to Solomon, and related what they had seen. The King sent for some persons skilled in hieroglyphic knowledge, and from their interpretation, was fully assured, that those pieces of marble were a part of the marble pillar that had been erected by Enoch; and the ruins in which they had found so much treasure, were those of the Temple which he had consecrated to God before the flood. Solomon ordered the pieces of marble to be carefully put together, and deposited in the sacred vault.

History My dear Brother, your good conduct, zeal and discretion, have been the cause of our determining you give you, in the end, the true knowledge of perfection. You have now received the name of Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Mason—we are also happy to, my venerable Brother, in having a circumspection in giving you this knowledge, without which we should be liable to the same fatality that the 3 first degrees has been subject to. You know, my Brother, when the temple at Jerusalem was finished, the Masons had achieved great honor, their society was established into an order and the extreme niceness of the Brethren in their choice of fit objects rendered them respectable for merit—and merit only proved as yours has been—procured them this advantage. The Grand, Elect, prefect and Sublime Masons were not by any means to be seduced to determine in favor of Candidates who were unworthy, but received those (of at the utmost hazard to themselves) who appeared deserving of that Honor. The principal members of the Grand, Elect, perfect and Sublime Masons, being able workmen, passed from Jerusalem after the dedication of the Temple, and dispersed themselves among the neighboring nations, to instruct them in the Truth of the Royal Craft, but with the precaution of only initiating the males, and those of a free and eminent understanding. Notwithstanding this resolve, Masons in the inferior degrees multiplied over the face of the earth—their numbers increased beyond measure, by which means their secrets were disclosed; their knowledge was made common, and they were held in no high esteem. The Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Masons only, had the precaution to conceal the higher Mysteries, by coming to a resolution not to raise any higher than a Master and if such were not circumspect in their words, actions and lives, to give them no further knowledge. As it was through the imprudence of some of the Brethren in the 3 lower degrees, that Cowans frequently obtained their Signs and tokens. These disorders chagrined the Perfect Masons (who luckily at that time were but few in number,) they took great pains to stop the contagion but all their endeavors were in vain, the Craft degenerated Insensibly. Receptions were obtained too easily, the intervals ‘39"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"-~ Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Mason between degrees were broke into too hastily and were scares separated at all. In the end they were not preferred by merit, but prefemng amusement to Instruction, innovations increased and new doctrines arose, which destroyed the old (that they ought to have adhered to). These differences occasioned disputes, quarrels, heart burnings, and dissensions, which in the end produced a total discovery of our works—for which we grieve, and by which masonry suffered in the three first Degrees. Happy it is for us who have the consolation of knowing the secret of the Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Masons—let us endeavor to render it impossible for this degree to share the same fate as the three lower; let us be animated with zeal to procure that Ancient perfection. We travel to obtain their science and to follow their direction, in order to get a full knowledge of their noble occupation. The study and initiation of the Grand Architect of the Universe were always their principle object, and his holy name was the Ancient Masters Word. Solomon chose that word expressly in order to fill the principle workmen with due reverence for the great God, to whom the temple was dedicated, and also to excite them never to neglect the Execution and Duties of their office; so that the Masters uniformly followed their Occupation with this their Grand secret The Sign, Token and Words of which make a parts of this degree. The sage King knew all the force of this Holy Name—he knew that the Grand Architect of the Universe appeared to Moses in the Burning Bush (near which our Lodge is kept) and declared to him that this was his name, and that he was the only one of the patriarchs that knew it; and further that he would be invoked by no other name in the Temple, which he would order to be built in the land of promise, upon the plan and design of the Tables of the law to be deposited therein. This his holy name having so great a report in, and to, the construction of the temple, was the reason of its being made the Masters Word. When Hiram Abiff was killed, we being convinced of his courage and discretion in never disclosing this secret It was resolved never to entrust a matter of this importance in the future to a single person; therefore the Master’s Sign, Token and Word were changed ass it is before related, and not other than the Ancient Masters knew it, until it was taken by the Knights of the Royal Arch 140"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":".w Grand, Ekct, Perfect & Sublime Mason from the Delta in the ruins of Enoch, where was wrote the true name that was made the principle object of the perfection of Masonry. Solomon and Hiram King of Tyre being satisfied in having placed in safety the precious deposit of the Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons under the 5:5: he named this place the Sacred vault, a denomination truly just; because there was nothing on the Pedestal, save the Divine Delta, and this column was the third that supported the Temple of which you know everything but indifferently, and have always been kept ignorant of the true situation of the Hebraic name thereof, which is that of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and which is called the pillar of perfection and sustains wonderfully the most beautiful place in the Universe. The curious Cowans have not been able to discover the place were this sacred word was deposited, as it was always kept a secret from all Masons, but those of the Royal Arch and of this degree. A strict guard was ever kept at the door, to prevent admission to any but the Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Masons, who repaired there to contemplate the mystery of the sacred word, and there was one substituted in its place for the Inferior degrees, so that it was not possible for any greater precaution to be taken by this wise prince, to preserve this great name from all profane persons, and which rule has always been observed by the Grand Elect, who lived after him, and were possessed of this zeal, and which has been handed down to each other. Then Commenced the unity of the fraternity, which was sworn by the grand, Elect, to which this word was a seal. The Temple was finished in the year of the world 3000, being six months and six days from Solomon’s laying the first stone, and finished with the utmost pomp, brilliancy, and magnificence. This ceremony being over, Solomon gave audience for three days successively to all the Brethren. The first day was to the Elected Masters who were introduced into the sacred vault—the Knights of the Royal Arch took care of the Arches of the vault, & guarded the entrance thereto, at the same time the Grand Masters Architect were in the kings Apartment He qualified with the Degree of Perfection, the most virtuous among the two orders, & made them promise solemnly, to live by themselves in peace and union and benevolence in 141"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"..“ Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Mason Imitation of their deceased Chief, and that the basis of their actions might like him, be that of Wisdom, justice and equity, and to keep a profound silence relative to their mysteries, & never to reveal them to any one who did not deserve this signal favor by their zeal, fervor & constancy, & to assist mutually each other by their works, and to punish severely treason, perfidy & injustice. On which he gave them his blessing 7 discovered to them the Ark of Alliance open, from which the grand Architect of the Universe used to deliver his oracles. He ordered many sacrifices and admitted them to a holy libation, he embraced them and gave to each gold ring, as a proof of the alliance they had contracted with virtue and the virtuous. He gave them many present with permission to stay or retire as they should choose. The second day Solomon gave admittance to the Masters and Knights Elected in the heart of the Temple, & made them promise as the others had done, that they never would depart from the principles of virtue, of which their ancient chief was a model; always to live united & to help each other in their works. He bestowed on them the degree of Grand Master Architect & decorated them with all the honors relative thereto, & made them promise that they would be faithful guardians of their mysteries & never to communicate them to any who did not merit theni. He bestowed on them many favors and permitted them to stay or retire at their discretion. The third day Solomon gave audience to the Fellow Crafts and Apprentices in the Eastern part of the Temple. He gratified the Fellow Crafts who appeared to him to be virtuous, with the degree of Master, and the Apprentices with that of Fellow Craft. He introduced them into the porch of the Temple, and made them of both degrees, promise never to depart from the principles of virtue, of which their Ancient Chief was their pattern, and to be always united, assisting each other mutually, and to keep secret among them, the Sign, Token and Word of each Degree, and never to communicate them to any but those who should merit it, by their goodness, and were known to be virtuous: he loaded them with presents, and permitted them to stay or go where they pleased, he also 142"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":".w Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Mason gave order to his Intendants to defray their expenses, until they should arrive at their own Countries and homes. King Solomon so wise and so just, in all that he had done, became in his latter days deaf to the voice of the Lord, proud of knowing himself to be the greatest Monarch on earth, and having built a Temple so large, that the structure and magnificence of it was the admiration of the Universe: Soon the king did forget the goodness of God, and gave himself up to licentiousness & idolatry; his shameful & excessive complacency to his wives, led him into their vices, and by that means destroyed the piety of his former life, and drew upon him the displeasure of the Almighty. He also profaned the holy temple by offering the incense to the idol Moloch, which should have been burnt in the S:S: This conduct of the King was soon imitated by a great part of the nation, and was viewed with a great deal of concern, anxiety and detestation by all good men and Masons, who brought up their children in his paths of virtue , & according to the tenets they had received by the holy and respectable union that substituted among them. They also endeavored by their counsel and good example to deter & dissuade their fellow citizens from that impiety and sacrilege, which they was so guilty of, but despairing of being able to succeed, they remembered in the bitterness of their hearts the vengeance that god had taken on their forefathers for their disobedience. They imagined that lightning would fall on their heads, and that the superb Temple would be laid low, that Jerusalem would be destroyed, & that their children would suffer for the iniquities of the nation, by a dreadful slavery. These expectations determined the greatest part of the good masons to banish themselves voluntarily out of Judea, so that they might not be inspectors, & sharers in the expected horror & destruction, whenever it should happen. The crime of the name having arrived at their utmost pitch, & the time come, when god had resolved to deliver them into the hands of their Enemies— Nabuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, by means of Nebuzaredan his General, laid siege to Jerusalem which he took, and having Mastered all Judea, he razed the walls and destroyed to the foundation the Temple of the living God, took the 143"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"..w Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Mason inhabitants with their King Zedekiah captive into Babylon, exporting with him all the riches of thier Temple.

They intrepidly exposed themselves to the fury of the soldiers who guarded the door, till they penetrated through the ruins in the sacred vault, and search with great ardor, till they found the golden plate, on the cubic triangular stone of agate. They also found there the body of Galahad, the son of Sophoris, who was a man of note among the Perfect masons, & chief of the Levites. Galahad was, at the time, chief guard of the sacred vault, to take care of the burning lamps, and to adore and contemplate the Ineffable Word. He was a man equal to Hiram Abiff who 400 years earlier had lost his life rather than disclose the secret of the Master. This Galahad preferred being buried alive in the ruins of the Temple rather than discover (by his departure) the Treasure to be defiled by the hands of the barbarians. They all cried MAHA MAHARABAC, God be blessed, we have found it—and this is the 31d pass word and the most necessary to be known by the faithful guardians of the sacred treasure. It is difficult to express the other demonstrations of joy, with which they were filled at this time.

The Grand priest in the middle of a small number of Perfect Brethren who formed a circle like a chain, used to spell it once a year in the Temple, giving orders to the people to make a great noise, less they should be head by them. By their having so great a circumspection, they lost the method of writing & pronouncing this great name. They were uncertain of the number of letters which composed ~t, & by stopping and giving the syllables, the true pronunciation, which has securely rested to this time only with the Grand, Elect, Perfect & Sublime Masons. As God permitted the Ancient Masters, who were not Elected, and who had the knowledge of this word, before the death of Hiram Abiff, & who had treated Solomon so ill, to form the blamable project of penetrating into the ancient ruins of Enoch, by which means they were all destroyed.

Some of the few who preserved themselves from the general corruption, having with a regret of heart seen some of their Brethren depart from the road of virtue, took a resolution of keeping & preserving their secrets, & remembering certain Signs, which the folly of their Brethren made them forget—they separated themselves from them as if they were not countrymen. The time arrived when the Christian princes combined together for conquering the holy land, and delivering Jerusalem out of the hands of the Turks, who had it in possession. The good & virtuous Masons worthy of the heritage of those who built the Temple. voluntarily contributed to the execution of so holy an enterprise, & offered their service to the confederate princes on these conditions, that they should have no other Chief but one of their own choosing. The princes accepted their offer & they hoisted their own Standard and departed. In the tumult and disorder of the war they still retained the principles of virtue of which their father had given them the model; they lived perfectly united, lodging together in the same tents without any distinction of rank they knew any general, but in time of battle, retiring on an Equality & giving mutual assistance to each other, and extending their charity to the indigent & even to their Enemies.

The generous Mason replied that tribute was only due to the Grand Architect of the Universe. That they took up arms to defend the common cause, that Judea was their ancient country, & that their fathers had been obliged to abandon it for many years, the particular circumstances of which, when they reflected on, brought tears from their eyes. The princes were surprised to meet with so great virtue among the Brethren, and requested to be admitted into their society, & to be particularly initiated into their mysteries. The Masons replied that wisdom, justice & probity, peace, good manners & equity, friendship & union, were the principal laws which charmed them, & their zeal & fervor were recompensed, by partaking of the mysteries of which they had become worthy by their constancy.

The King having ceased speaking, the whole Council obseives a profound silence. The Minister of State, gathers the suffrages of each Knight, and reports the same in the Kings right ear, who commands the General of the Army to introduce Zerubabel. After introducing him with a white robe, girded with a broad green ribbon, and in this situation he brings him up to the throne, when falling on his knees, the King says— Rise.

So may God maintain me in uprightness & Justice. Amen. Amen. Amen. After which the Candidate has the Draft explained to him. The Grand Orator then relates the following §. History. The Knights of the East date their origin from the captivity of Babylon, where the Israelites remained 70 years, & after the siege of 2 years, they had their liberty granted them by Cyrus King of Persia. by the solicitations of Zerubabel, a Prince of the tribe of Judah, descended from the race of David, and Nehemias, as Holy Man, and of a distinguished family. Cyrus permitted them to return to Jerusalem, and to rebuild the temple, for which purpose, he restored to them all the ornaments which had been carried away at the distinction of Solomon’s Temple by Nebuzaradan, General of Nebuchadnezzars Army. The ornaments & utensils restored to them amounted to 7410. 165"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Knight of the East, or Sword p... He entrusted the whole to Zerubabel, commanding him to build the new temple 70 cubits high, and as many broad. He issued an edict, enjoining all his subjects, to let the Free Masons, pass through his dominions without giving them any molestation, under the pain of death to those who should infringe his commands. He ordered Satarbuzanes, his General, teach Zerubabel the art of war, he armed him as a Knight, and gave him powers to confer the same degree on such of the masons whom he should judge worthy of so distinguished an honor. Zerubabel then assembled all the Israelites to the number of 42,360, exclusive of slaves. He selected those Free Masons who escaped the general slaughter & fury of the soldiers at the destruction of the Temple, and assembled 7000 of them. he armed them all Knights, and placed them at the head of the people, to fight such as should oppose their passage on the road of Judea. The march of the Israelites was prosperous, until they arrived at the banks of the Euphrates or Starbuzanal, which separates Judea from Syria. The Knights masons who arrived there first, found armed troops disposed to hinder them, from passing the bridge, on account of the treasure of the Temple, which they carried along with them. Neither the remonstrances of the Knights, nor the edict of Cyrus was able to restrain their insolence. They fell upon the Knights, who repulsed them with such ardor, that while they were all, either drowned, or cut to pieces, on the bridge. After this victory, Zerubabel caused an altar to be erected on the field of battle, on which he offered sacrifices to the God of Armies, who had fought for Israel. He took YAVERON HAMAIM for a Pass Word, as it signifies Liberty of Passage. The Israelites passed the river, and arrived at Jerusalem, after a four months march, on the 22~ of June, at 7 o’clock in the morning. After a rest of 7 days, the Architects with their associates, began to lay out the New Temple. They divided the workmen into classes, each of which had a chief, and 2 assistants. Each degree in every class, was paid according to their rank in the work, and each had his respective word. 166"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"—~ Knight of the East, or Sword ~ The word of the 1St Class was JUDEA, and were paid at the Column which stood at the entrance to the Temple. the word of the 2”~ Class was BENJAMIN, and received their wages at the Portico. The 3 id Class received theirs in the middle of the Temple, after pronouncing YAVERON HAMAIM. The same order was observed at the construction of the new temple, as was practiced in the building of the first. The work was begun when the Knights Masons were disturbed by false Brethren from Samaria, who jealous of the glory, which the tribes of Judah and Benjamin would acquire, being now free, resolved to make war against them, and defeat their design of re-building the Temple. But Zerubabel, being informed of their intentions, immediately gave orders that all the workmen should be armed, with the trowel in one hand and the sword in the other, that whilst they worked with the one, they might defend with the other, and be able to repulse the enemy if they should present themselves. The construction of the new temple lasted 40 years. It was began in the reign of Cyrus, and was finished in that of Artaxerxes—this Temple was consecrated in the same manner as the first was, by Solomon. The Decalogue and the ordinances of Moses were observed a new, and a chief was appointed to govern the nation. He was chosen from among the Knights Masons, called Knights of the East, because they were freed and created Knights, by Cyrus, King of Persia. Their 2”~ Temple having been destroyed by the Romans, the Knights Masons of the present age, are descendants of those who constructed it, were obliged, under the conduct of Zerubabel to raise a third to the glory of the Grand Architect of the Universe.

The Saxnaritans having refused to pay the tribute for the sacrifices of the Temple, Zerubabel sent 5 ambassadors of Knights of the East to the Great King Darius whose residence was at Babylon to prefer his complaints to him. The Saniaritans having notice thereof assembled to oppose their passage, but those Knights being filled with zeal and courage valiantly fought and forced a passage to Babylon. where they made known the subject of their embassy to the Great King Darius. The king, to render them Justice, gave them a latter in which he ordered the Saniaritans to submit themselves and pay a tribute to the Jews, his allies. On their return to Jerusalem they were received in royal pomp and magnificence. The people met them without the city & accomplished them, singing songs of joy and praise for their happy return. They proceeded to Zerubabel to whom they delivered the letter of the Great King Darius—Zerubabel read it with a loud voice and gave orders to inform the people of the embassy, & that the Great King Darius had graciously granted their request & in consequence of their fidelity & courage they were appointed Governors and Princes of Jerusalem to render Justice to the people. They were 177"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Prince of Jerusalem ~ ornamented with habits of gold stuff, most rare and precious. They were decorated with a yellow ribbon which hangs from the right shoulder to the left hip, to which was suspended a medal of gold upon which was engraved a balance, to shew that they ought to conduct themselves with Justice and Equity. There was also a hand of Justice on the reverse side of the medal, as a mark of their authority over the people, as Princes of Jerusalem, which dignity was offered to them as a recompense for their services rendered & the courage they manifested in protecting the workmen in the construction of the Temple, & on the embassy. They assembled in the two chambers of the Temple to render justice to the people. This, my dear Brother, is an exact abridgment of the origin of the Princes of Jerusalem. §.

When the Knights and Princes were embodied to conquer the Holy Land, they took a cross to distinguish them, as a mark of being under its banners. They also took an oath to spend the last drop of their blood to establish the true religion of the Most High God. Peace being made, they could not fulfill their vows, and, therefore, returning home to their respective countries, they resolved to do in theory what they could not do by practice—And determined never to admit or initiate, any into their mystic ceremonies, but those who had given proofs of Friendship, Zeal, and Discretion. They took the name of Knights of the East and West, in memory of their homes and the place where the order began; and they have ever since invariably adhered to their ancient customs and forms of Reception. In the year 1118, the first Knights, to the number of Eleven, took their vows between the hands of Garinus, Patriarch and Prince of Jerusalem, from whence the custom is derived of taking the obligation in the same position. 192"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Knights of the East & West i’.. §.

Q. What signifies the seven stars? A. The seven qualities which Masons should be possessed of—Friendship, Union, Submission, Discretion, Fidelity, Prudence and Temperance. Q. Why should a Mason be possessed of these qualities? A. Friendship is a virtue that should reign among Brothers. Union is the foundation of society; Submission, to the laws and regulations, and decrees of the Lodge, without murmuring; Discretion, that a Mason should always be on his guard, and never suffer himself to be surprised; Fidelity, in observing strictly our obligations; Prudence, to conduct ourselves in such a manner that the profane, though jealous, may never be able to censure our conduct; and Temperance, to avoid all excesses that may injure either body or soul. Q. What signifies the 7 candlesticks, with their 7 letters? A. Seven crimes, which Masons should always avoid; viz: Hatred, Discord, Pride, Indiscretion, Perfidy, Rashness, and Calumny. Q. What are the reasons that Masons should particularly avoid these crimes? A. Because they are incompatible with the principles and qualities of a good Mason, who should avoid doing an injury to a Brother, even should he be ill treated by him, and unite in himself all the qualities of a good and upright man. Discord is contrary to the very principles of Society; Pride prevents the exercise of humanity; Indiscretion is fatal to Masonry; Perfidy should be execrated by every honest man; Rashness may lead us into unpleasant and disagreeable dilemmas; and Calumny, the worst of all, should be shunned as a vice which saps the very foundation of friendship and society.

The Master of Ceremonies goes to the Candidate and decorates him in the attributes of the last degree he has received, & also with his sword and white gloves on. He then says to him—”All the temples are demolished; our tools are destroyed with our columns; the sacred word is lost, notwithstanding all our precaution; and we are in ignorance of the means of recovering it, or of knowing each other. The order, in general, is in the greatest consternation— Will you assist us in recovering the word?” The Candidate replies— “Most cheerfully.” The Master of Ceremonies says—”Follow me, if you please”—when he conducts him to the door of the chapter, whereon he knocks as a Knight of Rose Croix. The Senior Warden demands—”Wbat do you want?” A. It is Brother Knight of the East and West, who is wandering in the woods & mountains, & who, at the destruction of the second temple, lost the word and humbly solicits your aid and assistance to recover it.

I have learned three virtues by which to conduct myself in future, Faith, Hope, Chanty—inform me if there are any others.

The Candidate knocks on the door, and the Warden, for answer, shuts the door in his face. The Master of Ceremonies says—’These marks of indignity, are not sufficiently humiliating, you must pass through more rigorous proofs, before you can find it.” He then takes off the Candidate the chasuble and black apron, and puts over him a black cloth covered with ashes & dust, and says to him— “I am going to conduct you into the darkest and most dismal place, from whence the word shall triumphantly come to the glory and advantage of Masonry; place your confidence in me.” He then takes him into the 3 rd apartment, and takes from him his covering, and makes him go three times around, (showing him the representation of the torments of the dammed,] when he is led to the door of the Chapter and the Master of Ceremonies says to him— ‘The horrors which you have just now seen, are but a faint representation of those you shall suffer, if you break through our laws, or infringe the obligation you have taken.” The Master of Ceremonies knocks on the door of the Chapter, and the Warden reports to the Master, who orders him to go and see who knocks.
