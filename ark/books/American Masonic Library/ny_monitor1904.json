Almighty and merciful God, we bless Thee for - ever; hear us with indulgence, have pity for our weakness, and aid us with Thy strength. Thou to whom all thoughts and actions of men are known, give to us the wisdom to judge justly and merci - ful[y. If it be Thy will that we should guide and direct our brethren, preserve us from anger and vanity and error. Keep our feet from going astray. Lead us by the way of truth. Let us not yield to temptation, and seek to usurp those powers and rights whic’h properly belong to all Thy children. Strengthen our good resolutions to prevail against the selfishness and indifference of the world around us. Help us to perform all our duties, to ourselves, to other men, and to Thee. Let the great flood of Masonic light flow over the world. Par - don us when we offend. When we go astray, lead us back to the true path; and help our feeble efforts to remove all obstacles to the final triumph of the great law of love; and, having faithfully performed our duty here below, wilt Thou receive us into Thy Celestial Lodge above, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

[The custom may have had its origin in a practice ob - served by the ancient Jews of building their temples, schools, and synagogues on high hills, a practice which seems to have met the approbation of the Almighty, who said unto the Prophet Ezekiel, “Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof, round about shall be most holy”3"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nJ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargUS.fll w.stichtingarguS.fll w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus.fll w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv- stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv.stichtingargus .nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus .nl rw.stichtingargus .nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus .nl rw.stichtingargus.nl TW. stichtingargus.nl 1W .stichtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.StiCht ingargus .nl 1w.StiCht ingargus .nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 20, MONITOR or THE~ WORK. FORM A~D DIMENSIONS OF THE LODGE. The form of a Lodge is * * * * In length from east to west, in breadth between north and south, as high as the heavens and as deep as from the surface to the center. It is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Freemasonry, and to teach us that a Mason’s charity should be equally extensive. THE SUPPORTS OF A LODGE. It is supported by three great pillars, denomin - ated Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty; because there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important un - dertakings. They are represented by the three principal officers of the Lodge, the pillar ~Thsdom, by the Worshipful Master in the East, who is pie - sumed to have wisdom to open and govern the Lodge; the pillar Strength, by the Senior Warden in the West, whose duty it is to assist the Wor - shipful Master in the discharge of his arduous duties; and the pillar Beauty; by the Junior War - den in the South, whose duty it is to call the Craft from labor to refreshment, superintend them dur - ing the hours thereof, carefully to observe that the EN.TE1IED APPRENTICE. 21 means of refreshment are not perverted to in - temperance or excess, and see that they return to their labor in due season; that the Worshipful Master may receive honor, and they pleasure and profit thereby. THE COVERING OF A LODGE.

The Holy Bible is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man, * * *; the Square to the Master, be - cause it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compasses to the craft, because, by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circum - scribe their desires, and keep their passions in due bounds. ORNAMENTS. The Ornaments are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the In - dented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, check - ered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel, or tesselated border, of the manifold blessings and comforts which constantly surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm reliance on Divine Providenee, which is hieroglyphically represented by the blazing star in the center.

They are so termed because they are appropriated to partieulax parts of the Lodge where alone they should be found—the Square to the East, the Level to the West, and the Plumb to the South. * * * The Square teaches morality; the Level, equal - ity; and the Plumb, rectitude of conduct. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle-Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone in its iude and natural state, as taken from the quarry; the Per - fect Ashlar, one prepared by the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of the Fellow Craft, and the Trestle-Board is for the Master workman to draw his designs upon.

ENTERED APPRENT [CE. 25 PRINCIPAL TENETS. The Principal Tenets of our profession are threefold, including the inculcation and practice of those truly commendable virtues, Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family— the high, the low, the rich, the poor—who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, ahd pro - tect each. other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and con - ciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy; to sympathize with them in their misfortunes; to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis, we form our friendships and estab - lish our connections. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true, is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry.

Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us; s[neerity and plain dealing distinguish us; and the heart and the tongue join in promot - ing each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. FORTITUDE. - Fortitude is that noble and steady purpose of the mind, whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril, or danger, when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness or cowardice, and should be deeply impressed upon your mind as a ~afeguard or secu - rity against any illegal attack that may be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from you any of those valuable secrets with which you have been so solemnly intrusted, and which was emblemati - cally represented upon your first admission into the Lodge. * * * * ~ * * PRTJDEJS CE.

No institution was ever founded on a better principle, or raised on a more solid foundation; nor werc ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the seve - ral Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been eneouragers and pro - moters of the art, and have never deemed it derog - atory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, extend its privileges, and patronize its assemblies. There are three great duties, which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never mentioning His name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator, im - ploring His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and esteeming Him as the chief good; to your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you; and to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intem - perance, which may impair your faculties, or de - base the dignity oil your profession. The perform - ance of these dutie~ will entitle you to public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet and peaceable citizen, true to your government and just to your country.

In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Although your frequent appearance at our regu - lar meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with youi necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. During your leisure hours, that you may im - prove in Mifsonie knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be to receive, instruc - tion. Finally, keep sacred and inviolate the mysteries of the Fraternity, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among IMasous. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly care - ful not to recommend him, unless you are eon - x’inced that he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the Institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. 0"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nJ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargu s.nI xv. stichtingargu s.nI xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.n 1 ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl lxv. stichtingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl FELLOW-CRAFT.

By ORDER [N ARCHITECTURE, is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pi]asters; or, it is a regular ar - rangement of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from ~the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they Ih~st planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom, are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and eapi. tal of pillars; and, from this simple hint, origin. ally proceeded the more improved art of archi - tecture. The five orders are thus classed: the TUSCAN, Donic, IONIC, CORINTHIAN and COMPOSITE. THE TUSCAN is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"r w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargu s.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl -w.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.n 1 ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ,w. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl rxv. stichtingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl rxv. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl 1W .stichtingargus .nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl ixv.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stiChtingargus.nl ixv. stichtingargus.nl 88 MONITOR or THE WORE. THE DORIC, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. [ts column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, except mouldings; though the frieze, is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the orna - ments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Done, is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state. In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Done; for when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan pre - cedes the Done in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in its original state. TI-IE IONIC bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its coinice has dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the fameus temple of DIANA, at Ephesus, was of this order.

The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentils and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. The ancient and orig~nal orders of architecture, revered by Masons, are no more than three, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two, the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Done, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Cor - inthian. The first three orders aloue, however, show invention and particular character, and es - sentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally; the Tuscan is the Done in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian en - riched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the iRomans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in architecture. * * * * * * * THE FIVE HUMAN SENSES are: Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting.

By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires; and thus our reason is rendered capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended by the formation of this sense that we - should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge from social inter - course with each other. For these purposes we aie en - dowed with hearing, that, by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete. SEEING is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of nature. By this sense we find our way on the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars Nay, more, by it we perceive the tempers and disposi - tions, the passions and affections of our fellow-creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the coun - tenance will display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which administer to this sense are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the facnlties, SiGhT is the noblest. The struc - ture of the eye, and its appurtenances, evince the admir - able contrivance of nature for performing all its various FELLOW-CRAFT. 41 external and internal motions; while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demonstrate this organ to be the masterpiece of nature’s works. FEELING is that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of the bodies; such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion and extension. SMELLING is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and indeed most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth efflucia of vast subtility, as well in a state of life and growth, as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effluvia, being drawn into the nostrils along ~vith the air, are the means by which all bodies arc distinguished. Hence it is evident, that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal, through which the air continually passes in respiration. TASTING enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by it we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. 8melling and Tasting are inseparably connected, and it"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv.stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.n 1 ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘xv. stichtingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl ~xv.stichtingargus.n1 cxv. stichtingargus.nl ~xv.stichtingargus.n1 rw. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1W .stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w.StiCht ingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl rxv.stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl 42 MONITOR or THE WORK. is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices. * * * * * * * * * The proper use of these five senses enables us to form just and accurate notions of the operations of nature; and when we reflect on the objects with which our senses are gratified, we become conscious of them, and are enabled to attend to them, till they become familiar objects of thought. On the mind all our knowledge must depend; what therefore, can be a more proper subject for the investiga - tion of Masons? To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of Gon’s bounty to man, we shall add, that Memory, Imagination, Taste, Heasoning, Moral Perception, and all the active powers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field br philosophical disquisition, which far exceeds human inquiry, and are peculiar mysteries, known only to nature, and to nature’s God, to whom all are indebted for creation, preservation, and every blessing we enjoy. SEVEN STEPS. * * * * THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCI ENCES, are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geom - etry, Music, and Astronomy. Grammar is tbe FELLOW-CRAFT. 43 science which teaches us to express our ideas in appropriate words, which we afterward beautify and adorn by means of Rhetoric; while Logic in - structs us how to think and reason, with propriety, and to make language subordinate to thought. Arithmetic, which is the science of computing numbers, is absolutely essential, not only to a thorough knowledge of all mathematical science, but also to a proper pursuit of our daily avoca - tions. Or if desired the following may be given: GRAMMAR is the key by which alone the door can be opened to the understanding of speech. It is Grammar which reveals the admirable art of language, and unfolds its various constituent parts, its names, definitions and respective offices; it unravels, as it were, the thread of which the web of speech is composed. These reflections seldom occur to anyone before his acquaintance with the art; yet it is most certain that, without a knowledge of Gram - mar, it is very difficult to speak with propriety, precision, and purity.

LOGIC is that science which directs us how to form clear and distinct ideas of things, and thereby prevents us from being misled by their similitude or resemblance. Of all the hnman sciences, that concerning man is certainly most worthy of the human mind, and the proper manner of conducting its several powers in the attainment of truth and linondedge. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation or groundwork of our inquiries; particu - larly, in the pursuit of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons. is the art of numbering, or that part of mathematics which considers the properties of numbers in geiieral We have but a very imperfect idea of things without quantity, and as imperfect of quantity itself, without the help of Arithmetic. All the works of the Almighty are made in number, weight, and measure; therefore, to understand them rightly, we ought to understand arithmetical calculations; and the greater advance - ment we make in the mathematical sciences, the more capable we shall be of considering such things as are the ordinary objects of our conceptions and be thereby ‘V FELLOW-CRAFT. 45 led to a more comprehensive knowledge of our great Creator, and the works of the creation. GEOMEFRY. Geometry treats of the powers and properties of magmtudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered—from a point to a line, from a line to a superfices, and from a super- flees to a solid. A point is the beginping of all geometrical matter. A line is a continuation of the same. A superfices is length arid breadth without a given thickness. A solid is length and breadth, with a given thickness, which forms a cuhe and comprehends the whole. By this science the architect is enabled to. con - struct bis plans, and execute his designs; the gen - eral, to arrange his soldiers; the engineer to marh out grounds for encampments; the geographer to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms and provinces.

PLENTY. * ~* * * * * * MORAL ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY. Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on ~vhich the superstructure of Free - masonry is erected. By Geometry we may curi - ously trace nature through her various windings, to her most concealed recesses. By it, we discover the power, wisdom and goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it, we discover how the planets move in their FELLOW-CRAFT. 51 respective orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it we account for the return of the seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discertiing eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse and are all conducted by the same unerring law of nature. A survey of nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design; and the plans which he laid do~vn, being improved by time and experience, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignor - ance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of an - tiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and con - structed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force.

SECTION 3. Sacred history informs us that it was deter - mined in the councils of infinite wisdom, that a Temple should be founded at Jerusalem, Which should be erected to God, and dedicated to His Holy name. The high honor and distinguished privilege of performing this sacred service was de - nied to David, King of Israel, because (as the Scriptures inform us) ‘he had made great wars and shed blood abundantly. We also learn from the same sacred source, that the God of Israel had promised David that out of his loins He would raise up seed to serve Him. This divine and mem - orable promise was afterward fulfilled in the per - son of Solomon, and in the splendid and uner - ampled career of his prosperity. After David had been gathered to the land of his fathers, and the last honors paid to his memory, Solomon wielded the scepter of Israel, peace reigned within her borders, and the children of Israel looked for - ward with peculiar satisfaction for the display of that wisdom which was destined to astonish and amaze the world. In the second month of the fourth year of his reign, Solonion commenced the erection of this edifice, the curious workmanship of which was calculated to excite the wonder and .1 MASTER MASON. 59 admiration of all succeeding ages. It was located on Mount Moriah, near the place where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and where David met and appeased the destroying angel which was visible over the threshing-floor of Or- nan the Jebusite. About this time, King Solo - mon received a congratulatory letter from * * * * offering him every assistance in his power, and manift~sting a strong desire to participate in the high honors then clustering around the Throne of Israel. Thus was the building progressing, with the assistance of * * * * and under the immediate supervisloli of our ancient operative * * * * and was well-nigh completed, when several of the Craft in an attempt to extort from * * * * thus for a short period was the building impeded in its progress. * ~ * * * * * It is said to have been supported by fourteen hundred and fifty-three columns, and two thou’ sand nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest marble.

All these were classed and arranged in such manner, by the wisdom of Solomon, that neithei envy, discord, nor confusion, was suffered to in - terrupt or disturb the peace and good fellowship which prevailed among the workmen. * * * * * * * SYMBOLISM OF THE DEGREE. Thus have I rehearsed to you the legend of the * * * , a history venerated as a remi - niscence of days long past, and regarded by Masons with peculiar reverence, not so much for the history itself, as for the solemn and sublime doctrine it is intended to impress on our minds, viz.: the resurrection of ‘the body and the immor - tality of the soul. But in order that you may fully compre - hend and appreciate the intimate connection oi~ the whole * * * system, by the relative de’ pendenee of its several parts, I propose briefly to review the teachings of the ~wo preceding degrees, before entering upon the field of truth presented - in the sublime degree of * * * * Your admission amoag * * * in a state of * * * * and destitution was emblemati’ cal of the entrance of all men upon this their MASTER MASON. 61 mortal state of existence, when they, weak and beipless, are necessarily dependent upon others for protection and Life. As the noblest emotions of the heart are called forth by helpless infancy, so is the degree of * * * intended to inculcate the striking les - son of natural equality and mutual dependence. It taught you, in the active principles of universal beneficence and charity, to seek the solace of your own distresses by extending comfort and consola - tion to your fellow creatures in the hour of their affliction. It enabled you to free the mind from the dominion of pride and prejudice; to look beyond the narrow limits of human insti - tutions, and to view in every son of Adam a brother of the dust. Above all and beyond all, it taught you to bend with humility and resignation before the G. A. 0. T. U.; to dedicate to Him your heart thus purified from every malignant passion, and prepare your mind for the reception of truth and wisdom. Proceeding onward, still guided by the prin - ciples of brotherly love, relief, and truth, you were passed to the degree of * * * ~, where you were enabled to contemplate the intellectual faculties; to trace them from their origin through the paths of heaven-born science even to the throne ‘F"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"F ~v.stichtingargus.nJ ~v.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nJ w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargu s.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w,stiehtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.ni w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl I w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl C2 MONITOR OF THE WORK. of God Himself. The secrets of nature and the principles of moral truth were thus unveiled be - fore you. You learned the just estimate of those wondrous faculties wherewith God has endowed the creatures formed after His own image, and you feel the duty He has imposed upon you of cultivating those divine attributes with unremit - ting care and attention, that you may thereby be enabled to glorify Him and render yourself a contributor to the happiness of mankind. To the man whose mind has thus been molded to virtue and science, Nature presents one great and useful lesson more, the knowledge of himself. She leads you by contemplation to the closing hours of your existence; and when, by means of that contemplation, she has conducted you through the various windings of this mortal life, she finally instructs you how to die. She leads you to reflect upon your inevitable destiny, and prompts the in - ward monitor to say that death has no sting equal to the stain of fa[sehood, and that the certainty of death at any time is better than the possibility oI~ dishonor. Of this great principle * * * affords a glorious example in the unshaken fidelity and noble death of our * * * ‘~, whom you have this evening represented; and I trust it will be a MASTER MASON. 63 striking lesson to us all, should we ever be placed in a similar rtate of trial.

But these may be overcome; and still strong in faith and hope, he presses forward on life’s journey to meet his second and still stronger enemy, his * * * fitly represented by sorrow and misfortune, by dis - ease or poverty, by the coldness of false friends or the hostility of open enemies.

The Three Steps usual]y delineated upon the Master’s carpet, are emblematical of the three prin - cipal stages of human life, viz.: youth; manhood and age. In youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the at - tainment of useful knowledge; in manhood as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor, and ourselves; that so, in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflection conse - quent on a well-spent ]ife, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. MASTER MASON. 67 POT OF INCENSS. The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity; and, as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent Author of our existence, for the manifold blessings and corn forts we enjoy. THE BEE HIVE. The Bee Hive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven, to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches that as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fel]ow creatures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them; without incon - venience to ourselves. When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for days, months and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inelemencies of the weather.

Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of Gon; and he that will so demean himself as not to he endeavoring to add iio tbe common stock of knowledge and under - standing, may be deemed a drone in the l~ive of nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons. BOON OF CONSTITUTIONS. The Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s Sword reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words, and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry; ever beariug in remembrance those truly masonic virtues, silence and circumspection. SWORD POINTING TO A NAKED HEART. The Sword Pointing to a Naked Heart demon - strates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, ~vords, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of men, yet that MASTER MASON. 69 ALL-SEEING EYE, whom the SUN, Moon, and stars obey, and under whose watehfu[ care, even COMETS perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost re - cesses of the human HEART, and will reward us according to our merits. ANCHOR AND ARK. The Anchor and Ark are emblems of a well - grounded hope, and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that divine Ark, Which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that Anchor, which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.

SCYTHE. The Scythe is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold, what havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race! If by chance we should escape the numerous ills incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive to the years of manhood; yet, withal; we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of Time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us. * * * * * * * MASTER MASON.

The Grand iM aster elect, and the other Grand Offi - cers elect to be installed will be in waiting in an adjoining apartment. The announcement of the Installing Officer may be in the following form: Brethren, the Grand Master and other Grand Officers for the ensuing year having been duly elected, we are now in readiness to perform the ceremony of Installation. The Right Worshipful Grand Marshal will announce to them that we are waiting to receive them.

By immemorial usage and the irre - vocable landmarks of Masonry, you are invested as Grand Master of Masons, with powers and p re - rogatives which are well nigh absolute. The in - terests of the Craft, fo~ weal or woe, are placed in your hands during your term of office. The good resolutions, which I doubt not that you have formed in your own mind that these powers shall not be abused or perverted by you, I would gladly strengthen by a word of admonition, which it will not become me henceforth to utter. The very consciousness of the possession of a great power will ever make a generous mind cautious and gentle in its exercise. To rule has been the lot of many, and requires neither strength of jntellect nor soundness of judgm6nt; to rule well has been the fortane of but few, and may well be the object of an honorable ambition. It is not by the strobg arm or the iron will, that obedience and order, the chief requisites of good government, are secured, but by holding the key to the hearts of men. The office of Grand Master is of great anti - quity and respect, and is one of the highest digni - ties to which we may aspire. Its incumbent, to rule well, should possess and practice several im - portant requisites. As a man, he should be of approved integrity INSTALLATiON 01?

As a Mason, he could cling to the old land - marks, and be sternly opposed to their infringe - ment; be proficient in the laws, language, and literature of the Fraternity; be desirous to learn, and apt to teach; though not for the time a work - man, yet be master of the work and qualified to earn his wages; be prompt to aid and relieve, and slow to demand it; be ever mindful that, though elevated for a time above his fellows, he is elevated by them, is yet a Craftsman, morc sacredly bound by a Craftsman’s obligations, and should cultivate everywhere, and at all times, the golden tenets of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth.

In the Grand Lodge, to control practically the admission of all visitors, to announce specially those who are of rank or eminence, and to aid in tbe preser - vation of order and at all times to render counsel and advice to the Grand Master, are high, and responsible duties requiring circumspection, vigil - ance, and reflection; but when to these is super- added the more onerous labor, in conjunction with I — INSTALLATiON or GlIAND LODGE OFFJOI~~R5. 143 the Junior Grand Warden, of diligently preserv - ing the ancient landiiiarks throughout the juris - diction, it then becomes a trust of dcep momc at to the welfare of the Craft.

The keys forming the Jewel of your office have a twofold significance. They are instruments to bind as well as to loose; to make fast as well as to open.

The coffin having been deposited in the grave, the Master will say: Master—From time immemorial it has been the custom of the Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, upon request, to accompany the body of a deceased brother to the place of interment, and there to deposit it with the usual formalities. In conformity to this ancient usage, we have assembled at this time in the character of Masons to offer before the world the last tribute of our affection, and thereby to demonstrate in the strongest possible manner, the sip - cerity of our past esteem for him, and our steady attach - ment to the principles of the Fraternity. Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. In the midst of life we are in death.

And he said unto me, Son of Man, can these bones live? And I answered, 0 Loan God, thou knowest. Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, 0 ye dry bones, hear the word of the Loan. Thus saith the Loan God unto these bones: Behold I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. And] will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. Then said He unto me, Prophesy unto the wind: prophesy, Son of Man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the LORD God: Come from the four winds, 0 breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.

Brethren we are again called upon by a solemn adinoni - tion to regard the uncertainty of human life, the certainty of death, and the vanity of all earthly ambitions. Dc - erepitiidc and decay are written on everything. But a span—a heart-beat—a breath—divides the cradle from the grave; and it is a melancholy truth, that so soon as we begin to live, that moment also we begin to die. Frailty and imperfection are the incidents of our earthly con - dition; the Almighty fiat has gone forth—” Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” What an eloquent commentary is here exhibited upon the instability of every human pursuit: and how touchingly does it echo the~ sad sentiment of the immortal maxim, “vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” The city of the dead, my brethren, has a devout em - phasis in its solen-m silence. It tells us of the gathering within its embrace of parents’ fondest hopes; of the sever - ance of all earthly ties which bound us to the departed ones who gave us birth; of the darkness which has en- shrouded the bright prospects of the loving husband and the devoted wife; of the unavailing grief of the affectionate brother and tender sister; and of the sleep of death which here envelops many an early, many an instantaneous call into eternity—given in the midst of health, of gaiety and of brightest hopes. The last offices we pay to the dead are useless except as they constitute lessons to the living. The cold, marble form enclosed in the “narrow house” before you, is alike insensible to our sorrows and our ceremonies. It matters not now to him whether two or three gather around the V 158 MONITOR OF THE WORK.

It is of little moment how, or in what manner, his obsequies are performed: whether the wild winds chant his requiem, or it be accompanied with rare and costly music and the ministrelsy of many voices. Hjs spirit has gone to accom - plish the destiny of all our race; while his body, in the slumber of the grave, will be resolved into its original elements. What, then, are all the externals of human dignity— the power ol wealth, the dreams of ambition, the pride of intellect, or the charms of beauty—when nature has paid her 5ust debt? Look on the last scene and view humanity stript of its ornaments; and you must needs be persuaded of the utter emptiness of all human delusions. The monarch, at whose bidding nations pay obeisance, and the beggar at his gate, are equals in death. The one must part with his sceptre and his crown—the other with his staff and his rags—both are indebted to their mother earth for a common sepulchre. In the grave all fallacies are forgotten, all ranks are levelled, and all distinctions are obliterated. It is of record, in the volume of Eternal Truth, that perfection on earth can never be attained. The best of men have erred, and the wisest of our race gone sadly astray. Suffer, then, the apologies of humaii nature to plead for him who can no longer plead for himself. While we drop the sympathetic tear over the grave of our departed brother, let us not withhold from his memory the commendation that his. virtues claim at our hands. I 13UitIAI, Of’ Elf DEAD.
