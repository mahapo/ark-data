FROM darkness unto light I Re only knows Part of the truths which yet may wake his mind From out its former languorous repose, And make him feel how truly he was blind. He scarce can grasp th’ unfolded mysteries, Nor can he comprehend the secret ways Which he has still to trend, e’er he portrays To some apprentice their immensities, In Masonry he ‘s but a child in arms, And should be quite content to rest a while. Until the future all his fear disarms, Until he’s safely crossed the last crook’d stile, Which leads him from the maze into the plain, Where all is clear like sunshine after rain. E. A.

The Twenty-four-inch Gauge js an instrument made use of by operative masons, to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Acepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematical of the twenty-four hours, of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother, eight hours for our usual avocations, and eight for refreshment and sleep. The Common Gavel is an instrument made use of by operative masons, to break off the corner~ of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builders use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our minds and consciences of all the vices and super - fluities of life, thereby fitting our bodies as liv - ing stones for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. CHARGE. W. M.~*** My brother, as you are now in troduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratu[ate you on being accepted into this Ancient and Honorable Order—ancient, as hay - ing subsisted from time immemorial, and honor - able, as tending, in every particular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better prin - ciple, or more solid foundation; nor were ever"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"IIJILIHbII1J~EJ ______ 26 more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men in all ages have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory from’ their dignity to level themselves with the fra - ternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties which. as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—-to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To Cod, in never mentioning His name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable under - takings, and to esteem Him as the chief good To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you would that he should do unto you. And to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, which may im - pair your faculties or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet and peace - ful subject, true to your government and just to your country. You are not to countenance dis - loyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor be particularly eareful to avoid censure or reproaeh. Let not interest, favor or prejudice bias your integrity 27 or influence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no aeeount to be neglected. Neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignor - ance, may ridieu]e it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give as you will be ready to receive in - strijetion Finally, keep saered and inviolable the nlys - teries of the order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequenee among Masons. If, in the eirele of your acquaintanee, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be partleularly careful not to reeom - mend him unless you are convinced he will con - form to our rules, that the honor, glory, and reputation of the institution may be firmly estab - lished, and the world at large convinced of its good effects.

WITHIN my heart, 0 Lord of light, Let no base passion come to stay; Fill it with glory infinite, And give me still the power to pray. Keep everything within my breast Sacred and safe from thoughts profane; Pardon, 0 Lord, the sin confessed, Thy everlasting mercy deign. Vouchsafe, Most High, to give to me A heart to live for Thee alone— A Heart ol! lasting Purity, A Heart, Jehovah, like Thine own. Unto my latest earthly hour, Uphold and ever succour me; Grant, 0 Great God, Thy perfect power, Thy perfect power—Fidelity. Light. By Bro. Cha8. F. Forshaw, LL. D. NO men are Masons till Masonic Light Shines forth upon their awed and eager eyes; Until breaks forth upon their wondering sight The Lodge’s form, and they are bade to rise. And, Oh! The Light is welcomed by us all— What groping wanderer loves the shrouded night? And soon we know that harm could ne ‘er befall, For some true Brother led our feet aright. This is a tender lesson to the Soul— A lesson fraught with all-absorbing good, Which ever points to that ne ‘er-darkened goal, To which we strive to lead the Brotherhood.

Across the panorama of my life, With measured step and cadent march, there comes The constant keeper of my passing hours A gange he holds, whose graded surface marks The daily hours and moments of life And to the fateful hour glass pointing, warns How fast the sands of time are rushing on. He stops; and from his leathern girdle takes His ready gavel. With skillful blows The roughened corners from the unhewn stone He breaks, and fits it for the builder’s hand. Behold! the aproned fellow craft receives, Upon the Temple’s wall, the perfect stone. He in its fitting place, with square and plumb And fault]ess level’s aid, adjusts it true. And now the Master’s eye inspects the work; Which being good, his approbation gains; And o ‘er the accepted stone, with trowel bright He spreads cement. And ~inion makes so firm That of the wall the stone becomes a part. So man by nature, rough as unhewn stone Appears; and from his character must break Those superfluities of life which mar His perfect manhood. Wa]king by the plumb And acting so the square of virtue true And rigid probity shall ever be The rule and standard of his future life, Accepted by The Master he shall fill His rightful place. It matters not to him If down beneath the surface of the earth He lies and forms foundation for the rest; Or in the dark recesses of the wall; Or corner-stone, or keystone of the arch; Or flowered chapter of Corinthian pile. Enough for him that in his Master’s eye He stands approved. That he is worthy found To be a lively stone within that house Not made with hands; eternal in the heaven. E. A Degree Lec., 2nd Sec. W.

W..—The Holy Bible, Square and Com - passes. W. M.—To whom are they dedicated? 5. W.—The Bible points out the path that leads to happiness, and is dedicated to God. The Square teaches us to regulate our conduct by the principles of morality and virtue, and is dedi - cated to the Master. The Compasses teach us to limit our desires in every station, and are dedi - cated to the Craft. W. M.—Why are they thus disposed of? S. W.—The Bible is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man, a on it w oblg a nwl admtd bin; the Square to the Master, because, being the proper W. M.—Why is it o! such vast dimensions? S. W..—To show the universality of Masonry, and that Masonic charity should be equally extensive. COVERING. W. M.—What covering has a Lodge? S. W.—A clouded canopy or starry-decked"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"44 Masonic emblem of his office, it is constantly to remind him of the duties he owes to the Lodge, over which he is appointed to preside; and the Compasses to the craft, because, by a due atten - tion to their use, they are taught to regulate their desires and keep their passions within due bounds. ORNAMENTS. W. M.—What are the ornaments of a Lodge? S. W.—The Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. M. M.—What are they? S. W.—The Mosaic Pavement is a representa - tion of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the Indented Tessel, that beautiful tessellated border or skirting which surrounds it; and the Blazing Star in the center, is commemo - native of the star which appeared to guide the wise men of the East to the place of our Savior’s nativity. W. M.—Of what are they emblematical? S. W.—The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the beautiful border which surrounds it, those bless - ings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. LIGHTS. W. M.—How many lights has a Lodge? S. W.—Three. 45 W. M.—How are they situated? S. W.—East, West and South. W. M.—None in the North? S. W..—None. W. M.—Why not? S.

M.—How many jewels has a Lodge? S. W.—Six-—three movable and three im - movable. W. M.—What are the immovable jewels? S. W.—The Square, Level and Plumb. W. M.—W hat do they Masonically teach? S. W.—The Square teaches morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of life. W. M.—What are the movable jewels? S. W.—The Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ash - lar, and the Trestle-board. W. M..—What are they? S. W..—The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adjusted by the tools of the Fellow Craft. The Trestle-board is for the master workman to draw his designs upon. W. M.—Of what do they remind us? S. W.—-By the Rough Ashiar we are remind- -~-,.,,, ,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"46 47 ed of our rude and imperfect state by nature by the Perfect Ashlar, that state of perfectiou at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous educa - tion, our own endeavors, and the blessing God; and by the Trestle.board we are also minded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his Trestle - board, so should we, both operative and specula - tive, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Book of Life, which is our spiritual Trestle- board. LODGES-.-..HOW SITUATED. lIT. M.—How should a Lodge be situated? S. W.—Due East and West. W. M.—Why so? S. W.—Beean~e that was the situation of King Solomon’s Temple. W. M..—Why was King Solomon’s Temple qo situated? S. W.—Beeaus~, after Moses had safely con - ducted the Children of Israel through the Red Sea, when pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he then, by Divine command, erected a tabernacle and situated it due east and west, in order to perpetuate the remembrance of the mighty east wind by which their miraculous deliverance was wrought, and also to receive the rays of the ris - ing sun. And as the tabernacle was an exact model of King Solomon’s Temple, therefore all Lodges should be situated due east and west. To WHOM DEDICATED. W. M.—To whom were Lodges anciently dedi - cated? S. W.—To King Solomon. W. M.—Why so? S. W.—Because he was our first Most Excel - lent Grand Master. W. M.—To whom are they dedicated in modern times? S. W.—To St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time there is repre - sented in every regular and well-governed Lodge, a certain Point within a Circle; the Point representing an individual brother; the Circle representing the boundary line of his duties to God and man, beyond which he is never to su~er his passions, prejudices or interests to betray him on any occasion. This Circle is embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were perfect parallels in Christianity as well as Masonry; and upon the vertex rest the book of Holy Scriptures, which point out the whole duty of man. In going round this Circle we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially err. j 1/"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"~Yr 48 TENETS. W. M.—What are the tenets of your profes - sion? S. W.—Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. AIIOTH-ERLY LovE. By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family—the high and low, the rich and poor—who, as created by one Almighty Par - ent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every coun - try, sect and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have temained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, wno are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sin - cere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sym - pathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections TRUTH. Truth is a Divine attribute, and the founda - tion of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates en - deavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while 49 unlliienced by this principle, hypocrisy and de - ceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare and re - joicing in each other’s Prosperity.

W.—Ther~ are four, th Gtrl, th Petrl, th Mul a th Pdl, web aId to th. four erdnl vrtus, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice. TEMPERANCE Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason, as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or contracting any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence of which might lead him to disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to con - ceal and never reveal, and which would conse - quently subject him to the contempt and detes - tation of all good Masons, as wI as t th pn o hs oh, wh aIds t th Gtrl.

Fortitude is that noble and steady purpoi~e of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo I II II — ___________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"50 51 any pain, peril or danger when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice, and, like the former, should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every Mason, as a safeguard or security against any illegal attack that may be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from him any of those valuable secrets with which he has been so solemnly intinusted, and which was emblematic - ally represented upon his first admission into the Lodge, where he ws red on th pt o a shp ins at hs nk if b, wh aldst th Potri. PRUDENCE. Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge, and pru - dentially determine, on all things relative to our present as well as to our future happiness. This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the goverument of his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies; never to let fall the least sign, token or word whereby the secrets of Masonry might be unlaw - fully obtained, ever bring i mud tt mininbi perod,, whn on hs If k, bin bnt, hs int finmng a sqin, hs 1 h suptgthll ~,5aC,hsrtinstgthin11,whaldst th Mnl. which enables us to render to every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with Divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and as justice in a great measure constitutes the really good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate from the minutest principles therof, evin inmbrg th tin whn h ws pled in th N-E er o th L, hs ft fing a rt ang, wh aIds t th Pdl.

W.—13y Chalk, Charcoal, and Clay. W. M.—Why do they represent them? S. W.—Because there is nothing freer than Chalk, which upon~ the slightest touch leaves a trace behind; nothing more fervent than Char - coal, to which, when properly lighted, the most obdurate metals will yield; nothing more zealous than Clay, our Mother Earth, which is constant - ly employed for man’s use, and is an emblem to remind us that as from it we came, so to it we must all return. The following may be used: Our Mother Earth alone, of all the elements, has never proved unfriendly to man; the bodies of water deluge him with rain, Oppress him with hail, and drown him with inundations.

Forshaw, LL. D. ADMONISHED by the Plumb we walk upright, And hold the Scale of Justice equally; It shows to us the duty-line of Right, Portraying strict impartiality. It teaches what the medium must be— No constant gloom and no unceasing pleasure; And ruled by it, Freemasons ever see Their joys and sorrows in an even measure. Straight forward conduct, fearless and erect, Putting away all prejudice and pride; Tempering the passions, bidding us reflect, And choose with care whom we would have for guide Thus by the Plumb, we children of the Dust, Are taught at all times to be True and Just. The Level. By Bro. Chas. F. Forshaw, LL. D. WHAT does the Level demonstrate, you say7 And quick the answer cometh in reply! It tells us that we mortals are but clay, That prince and pauper, rich or poor, must Die. Death Levels all men !—On his darksome bed, All men are equal in God’s Holy Sight; For pomp and human greatness then has fled, And “Dust to Dust” all ranks and creeds unite. Social distinctions are-will ever be— Without this nile, chaos would reign supreme, But when the soul would from the body flee, And cross, unfettered, Death ~ relentless stream, Riches and power and titles cannot save- All men are claimed and Levelled by the Grave. The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative masons to raise perpendiculars; the Square, to square their work; and the Level to lay liorizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes. The Plumb ad - nionishes us to walk uprightly in our several sta - tions before God and man, squaring our actions by the Square of virtue, and remembering that we are traveling upon the Level of time to that “undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns.” S.

By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence will result a due propor - tion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelter from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the e ~ects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sun&ry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a Fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness.

They are the noblest instruments for improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea oF any prob - lem or proposition, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and his works, and are induced to encourage the studies of Astronomy, Geography, Navigation, and the arts dependent on them, by which society has been so much benefited.

By order in architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrange - ment; of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with, those oF a column, form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole. Or ITS Ai~rrIQuxTy. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. XVlien the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at the t;op and bottom, are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and, from this simple hint, originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. CLASSIFICATION The five orders are thus classed: The Tus - can, Doric, Fonic, Corinthian, and Composite. THE TUSCA~ Is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base and entablature have but few moldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. THE Doiuc, Which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any orna - ments on base or capital, except inouldings; though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the orna - ments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in strnctures where strength and a noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is com - posed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state. In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric; for when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in its original state. THE IoNIC Bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the inventio~m of which is attributed to the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"82 83 situated in the east part of the Lodge. and is represented by the Worshipful Master; the Doric, from the massive strength of its structure, is emblematic of the column of Strength, which is situated in the west part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Senior Warden; and the Corinthian, from the exuberance of its orna - ments, is emblematic of the column of Beauty, which is situated in the south part of the Lodge, and is represented by the Junior Warden. The number five furth~r alludes to the Fivs SENSES OF HUMAN NATURE, Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling an Tasting. Hx~nINa Is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to com - municate to each other our thoughts and inten - tions, our purposes and desires, and thus our rea - son is rendered capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature in - tended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the great - est and most important part of our knowledge by the information of others. For these pur - poses, we are endowed with hearing, that by a proper exertion of our natural powers, our hap - piness may be complete. Is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of Nature. By this sense, we find our way on the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, de - termine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more; by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections, of our fellow-creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dis - semble, the countenance would display the hy - pocrisy to The discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which administer to this sense, are the most astonishing parts oF the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admira - tion. SEEING Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye and its appurtenances evinces the admirable contrivance of Nature for performing all its various eKternal and internal motions; while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demonstrates this organ to be the masterpiece of Nature ‘s work."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"U FEELING Is that sense by which we distinguish the differ - ent qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smooth - ness, figure, solidity, motion, and extension. SMELLING Is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different iumpres - sions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and, indeed, most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of vast subtlety, as well in the state of life and growth, as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effiuvia being drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all bodies are distinguished. Hence, it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in respiration. TASTING Enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by Nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tast - ing; and by it we are capable of discerning the I The proper use of these five senses enables us to form just and accurate notions of the opera - tions of nature; and when we reflect on the ob- jects with which our senses are gratified, we be - come conscious of them and are enabled to attend to them, till they become familiar objects of thought. On the mind all our knowledge must depend; what, therefore, can be a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons? By an ana - tomical dissection and observation we become acquainted with the body; but it is by the anat - omy of the mind alone, we discover its powers and principles - To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God ‘s bounty to man, we shall add that memory, imagination, taste, reasoning, moral perception, and all the active powers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field For philosophical disquisition, which far exceeds human inquiry, and are peculiar mysteries, known only to Nature and to Nature’s God, to 84 85 changes which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. Smelling and tasting are inseparably con - n ected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices. 111111111111 ______________________________________ _________________"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"86 87 whom all are indebted for creation, preservation, and every blessing we enjoy.

The no sv alds to THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES, Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy. - GRAMMAR Teaches the proper arrangement of words accord - ing to ~he idiom or dialect of any particular people, and that excellency of pronunciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, and agreeably to reason and cor - rect usage. RHETORIC Teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject, not merely with propriety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance, wisely contriving to captivate the hearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat and exhort, to admonish or applaud. conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted or granted; and in it are em - ployed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning and disposing; all of which are natur - ally led on from one graduation to another, till the point in question is finally determined. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation, or ground-work, of our inquiries; particularly in the pursuit of those sublime prin - ciples which claim our attention as Masons. ARITHMET[C Teaches the powers and properties of numbers. which is variously affected by letters, tables, figures and instruments. By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given for finding out any certain number whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. The greater advancement we mah e in the mathemati - cal sciences the more capable we shall be of con - sidering such things as are the ordinary objects of our conceptions, and be thereby led to a more comprehensive knowledge of our great Creator, and the works of the creation. GEOMETRY Treats of the powers and properties of magui - tudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are considered—from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a super - ficies to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure, or an in - divisible part of space. LOGIC Teaches us to guide our reason discretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"88 89 A lIne is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth and thicicness. MUSIC Teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose delightful harmony by a mathematical and proportional arrangcment of acute, grave and mixed sounds. This art, by a series of ex- periments, is reduced to a demonstrative science, with respect to tones and the intervals of sound. It inquires into the nature of concords and dis - cords, and enables us to find out the proportion between them by numbers. ASTRONOMY Is that divine art by which we are taught to read thc wisdom, strength and beauty of the Almighty Creator in those sacred pages, the celestial hemis - phere. Assisted by astronomy, we can observe the motions, measure the distances, comprehend the magnitudes and calculate the periods and eclipses oF the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globes, the system of the world, and the preliminary law of nature. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive nnparallekd instances of wisdom and goodness, and through the whole creation, trace the glorious Author by his works. THE ADVANTAGES O~’ GEOMETRY. Geometry or the fifth science is most revered by Masons. By this science, the architect is enabled to con - struct his plans and execute his designs; the gen- eral, to arrange his soldiers; the engineer, to mark out grounds for encampments; the geog - rapher, to ~give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observa - tions, and to ~x the duration of times and sea - sons~ years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the foundation of architecture, and the root of the mathematics. (Tic stps.) S. D. (As thy aprh th S.)—Aft psg th strs w nx arv at th otr dr o th M C, wch w slil fnd grd b th J.

B.), being advanced to the second degree of Masonry, we congratulate you on your preferment. The internal and not the external qualifications of a man are what Masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge you will improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Mason, you are bound to discharge, or enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have estab - lished their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support, and be always ready to assist in duly enforcing them. You are not to palliate or aggra - vate the offences of your brthren; but, in the de - cision oF every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friend - ship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education which tends so effectually to achitecture, are selected by the fraternity to im - print on the memory wise and serious truths, and thus, through a succession of ages, are trans - mitted, unimpaired, the excellent tenets of our institution.

And though my purse is scant, The poor shall never want, And I am willing to be tried again. My brother goes astray; Ah! I know the way— The slippery way that turns the thoughtless inan. I run to draw him b~k; I point the dangerous track. And I am willing to be tried again. Lo, where yon structure rears its ample dome! ‘Tis light’s abode, ‘tis Masonry’s high hoine; See where its walls, by love cemented, rise, Till their bright turrets pierce the brighter skies; From where the East pours forth the ruddy ray, To where the West receives its fading ray; From the mild South to where the gelid North Marshals its storms and sends thein hurling forth. In form symmetrical the pile extends, Nor with earth’s center nor earth’s concave endB, Three pillars high their polished fabrics rear, And with united force the structure bear. This w,isdom called, that Strength, that Beauty named, Emblems of those whose hands the Temple frained Of work mosaic wrought with matchless skill— The pavement formed, designed the mind to fill With truthful images of man’s estate. To curb proud scorn and suffering truth elate. A blazing sun in liquid azure glows, And o’er the starry roof its luster throws; While all around bright hieroglyphics gleam Like Heaven’s jewels in a slumbering stream. Between the pavement and the starry spheres, Of many steps a rising way appears; Pleasing the path to hun by faith inspired, By hope sustained, by charity attired. But effort impotent and labor vain To hini who strives with carnal steps to gain; From out the Temple, flashing with light’s beams, Three rivers gush, then inix their crystal streams; Still as they roll, their limpid waves expand, Bless every shore and gladden every land, With the full tide of sweet fraternal Zove, Relief and truth, all hallowed from above.

To look, in the light of reason, to the gracious Being above As the infinite source of wisdom, and the source of infinite love, To follow in full submission wherever His will may lead. Such is the Mason’s mission, and such is the Mason’s creed. To trust in His infinite justice, in the light of His word, which saith: “I am thy Father in heaven, ‘ ‘—such is the Mason’s faith. That the spirit of love may guide him, wherever his feet may fare. Such is the Mason’s wish and hope, and such is his con stant prayer. And this is the Mason’s duty—always to live, and move On the plains of the Square and Level, under the law of love. Love which forgives, nor remembers the faults of a brother man; Nor fanneth the dying embers of hate into life again; Which holds up the hands of the helpless, carries relief to the poor, And greets wi±h a hearty welcome the stranger within its door; Which rescues a fallen brother from the gutters of grim despair, And smoothes from the brow of sorrow the wrinkles of doubt and care. —Anon. A Mason’s Landmarks. Dedicated to Bro. Ed. Burnizam, P. G. Al. The first ‘‘landmark’’ of this ancient clan, ‘‘Implicit trust in God” (not in man.) This “landmark,’’ if rightly understood, Teaches ‘‘universal brotherhood.’’ ‘‘Brotherhood,’’ then the second ‘‘landmark,’’ “Is light on the path,’’ where once ‘twas dark. In every clime and in every land These landmarks have and will ever stand. The third “landmark,” “Immortality,” Spirit ever was and will ever be. Life does not consist of fleeting breath; This “landmark’’ teaches, ‘‘there is no death.’’ God’s Word—”the Great Light of Masonry” In its ‘‘Truth’’ reveals a mystery “From One,” ‘‘in One,” ‘‘to One”—Cun’t you see “The landmarks of the Ancient and Free?’’ The “Square” with its angle four and three, A ‘‘landmark” reveals—Could you but see, Behind this Symbol—a truth is found That’s not exposed by speech or sound. The ‘‘Circle’’ in perfect expression To us reveals a sublime lesson, The ‘‘point’’ within its center—Oh see ‘‘Ancient landmarks’’ of eternity! The ‘‘Triangle’’ with three equal sides Teaches “God within us doth abide,’’ ‘‘All wise, all powerful, always here,’’ A “landmark” to every Mason dear. You on the white square—I on the black— ‘‘Three, five and seven’’ on the right track, In health or pain, in the light or the dark, Let us stand by the “ancient landmark.” Though slander may traduce the fair name, Though accused when we’re not to blame, Though assailed, let’s ever press on— Faithful to trust ‘‘as the widow’s son.’’ Ro8•i-cru-eAan. 118 S.

High Twelve. By Bro. Beaj. B. French List to the stroke of the bell— High Twelve! Sweet on the air they swell, To those who have labored well— And the Warden’s voice is heard, From the South comes the cheering word, “In the quarries no longer delve.’’ Again, ‘tis the Warden’s call— “High Twelve!” Lay aside guvel, hammer and maul, Refreshments for Craftsmen all, By the generous Master is given, To those who have cheerfully striven ‘‘Like men in the quarries to delve.’’ There is in each mortal’s life, Eligh Twelve! In the midst of hjs early strife— With earth’s groveling luxurious rife— The voice of the Warden comes, Like the roll of a thousand drums, ‘‘In earth’s quarries no longer delve.’’ List to the tones of the bell— High Twelve! As if oil high they ~e1I, Their silvery echoes swell; And again the voice we hear, As if from an upper sphere, “Hence for heavenly treasures delve.’’ exist, but that noble contention, or rather emu - lation, of who best can work, or best agree.

To glean the wisdom from your lips we sit, As it becomes us, tyros, at your feet; Glad that such privileges will permit~ Our gath ‘ring from your well-filled sheaf of wheat, Clad that we may with joy, having no fears, Draw from a store of half a hundred years. A life begun will never have an end, But, river-like, join the eternal sea, There with new beauties evermore to blend— From earthly cares and imperfections free, Your years with us are counted by the score— Yet will we wish you a half hundred more. There shall ring in the world of bliss High Twelve! When relieved from our work in this— If we ‘ye not lived our lives amiss— The Master shall call us there, Our immortal crown to wear, No more in earth ‘s quarries to delve."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"1W.

Upon the Altar lies the Sacred Law, The Square and Compass—mystic triune great; Their powers, their right, no pen could overrate, Nor yet define their trenchant repertoire. The room is holy where the Altar stands, For God’s own word is read within that place, And His own works are told with winning grace To men with minds that Masonry expands. ‘Tis well our Craft imbues us with the Right, Instilling many a blest and hallowed theme, And teaching, with a Wisdom all supreme, Our glorious Architect’s triumphant might, Preparing us, when our frail body dies, To meet Him ‘fore His Altar in the skies. The Beacon Light. By Bro. Robert Morris. A city set upon a hill Cannot be hid; Exposed to every eye, it will Over surrounding plain and vale, In influence shed, And spread the light o~ peace afar, Or blight the land with horrid war. Each Mason’s Lodge is planted so For high display; Each is a BEACON Lionv, to show, Life ‘a weary wanderers, as they go, The better way; To show, by ties of earthly love, How perfect is the Lodge above I obedienee and submission; to your equals, cour - teay and alfability; to your auperiora, kindness and condeacension. Univeraal benevolence you are alxvaya to ineulcate, and by the regularity of your own behavior, afford tie best example for the eonduet of others less informed. Be this your willing task, dear friends. While laboring here; Borrow from Him who kindly lends The HEAVENLY LADDER that ascends The higher sphere; And let the world your progress see, Upward, by Faith, Hope, Charity."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"153 W.

Make thou the record duly,— Our Mason life is there; Make thou the record truly, With close and anxious care. The labors on the busy stage,— At every step,—from age to age! Make thou the record pLainly,— Bow oft does error lurk. Herein our children mainly Will read their father’s work. Herein v~ill trace with joy or gloom, Our pathway to the closing tomb. Make thou the record kindly, Omit the cruel words; The Mason spirit blindly, A gentle shroud affords. Oh, let thy record grandly prove Freemasonry ‘s a thing of Love. Closing Ode. Hail, Brother Nasons, hail! Let friendship long prevail, - And bind us fast; May harmony and pence Our happiness increase, And friendship never cease While life doth last. May wisdom be our care; And virtue from the square By which we live, That we at last may join That heavenly lodge sublime, When we shall perfect shine With God above. When our last labor’s o’er, And scenes of life no more Charm our frail sight, Then in God’s holy care May each protection share, Bliss find unending there In perfect light. —Anon. Masonic Training.

Then train your boy in Mason’s truth; Lay deep the corner-stone in youth; Teach him to walk in virtue’s line, To square his acts by 5QUARE DIVINE; The cement of true love to spread, And paths of Scripture truth to tread; Then will the youth to manhood grow 156 157 bins, aing win a entn aid ev xst, bt tt nob en tn, or ‘intir emultn, o who bat en wk or bat agin.

Come, brethren of the mystic tie, Let us together meet, And, clasping firm each brother’s hand, Each other fondly greet. Around our kdge room a]tar stand, And pledge ourselves anew, To emulate the virtues of The good, the brave, the true. Be sure no sELfish word or deed Finds place within our hail; But strive to do a brother’s part, And help not one but all. Let no harsh word or unkind thought Profane this sacred place; Drive from your brows all fretful frowns, While smiles i]lume each face. A Fallen Brother. B~i Bro. Chas. F. Forshaw, LL. D. A broken column crumbling to decay, Can sometimes be restored to strength and beauty; And so a Brother erring on life’s way May be awakened to a sense of duty. Forget his faults—forgive his fooLish deeds, And still the hand of fellowship extend— And if he o’er and o’er ignores your pleas, Still o ‘or and o’er perz~uade him and befriend. Then haply ‘round our altar’s sacred shrine Again he’ll labor in the cause of truth; And through your aid gain such of love divine That age departs and leaves a lasting youth. Thus will he cut the ignoble bonds of m eife And like the Phoenix rise again to life."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"_______ II ~I IIII~I~I ~EI I I M. M. Degree Lec., 3d Sec. W.

In youth, as Entered Apprentiees, we ought industriously to oeeupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in manhood, as’ Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the diseharge of our respeetive duties to God, our neighbor and ourselves; that so in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflec - tions eonsequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality.

THE POT OF INCENSE Is an emblem of a pure heart, whieh is always an aeeeptable saerifiee to the Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and 169 benefleent Author of our existenee, ror the niani - fold blessings and eomforts we enjoy. THE B~ HIVE Is an emblem of industry, and recoinmends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven, to the lowest rep - tile of the dust. It teaches us that, as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are n want, when it is in oar power to relieve them without inconvenience to our - selves. When we tak6 a survey of nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; be lies languishing for days, months and years, totally incapable of pro - viding sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attack ~f the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering hirnstilf from the inclemencies of the weather. It inight have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth, to have made man independent of all other beings; but as depend - ence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were niade dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"171 170 common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of Nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy o~ our protection as Masons. TEE BooK OF CONSTITUTIONS, Guarded by the Tiler’s Sword, Reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry; ever bearing in reinembranee those truly Masonic virtues, Silence and Circums pec - tion. THE SWORD, PoINTING To A NAKED HEART, Demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and, although our thoughts, words and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that ALL SEEING EVE Whom the sun, moon and stars obey, and under whose watchful care even comets perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades the ininost re - cesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. THE ANCHOR AND ARK Are Emblems of a well-grounded Hope and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that devine Ark, which safely wafts us over this tem - pestuous sea of troubles, and that Anchor, which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease froin troubling, and the weary shall find rest. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID. This was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia; Africa and Europe, ~vaa initiated into several orders of priesthood, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his inind abun - dantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out inany problems and theo~ reins; and among the most distinguished he erected this, which in the joy of his heart, he called Eureka, in the Grecian language, siguify - ing, I have found it; and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a heeatomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences THE HOUR-GLASS Is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swift - ly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot, without aston - ishment, behold the little particles which are contained in this inachine, how they pass away almost imperceptibly, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they are all ex - hausted. Thus wastes man! Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope, toinorrow blos - soms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost, which nips the shoot, and when he thinks his greatness still L"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our Mother Earth. Tm~ SCYTHE Is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold, what havoc the scythe of Time makes among the human race! If by chance we should escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive to the years of manhood, yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all .devouring scythe of Time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us. t ti’nslt us fm ths imprfe to ~tt al prfe, gli’s a elstl L ab, whr th Suprm Arc o th U pi’s.

We part upon the square, for the world must have its due; We mingle with its multitude, a cold, unfriendly crew; But the influence of our gatherings in memory is green, And we long, upon the level, to renew the happy scene. There ‘s a world where aLL are equal—we are hurrying toward it fast,— We shall meet upon the level tl3iere when the gates of death are past; We shall stand before the Orient, and our Master will be there, To try the blocks we offer by His own unerring square. We shall meet upon the Level there, but never thence depart; There’s a Mansion,—’tis all ready for each zealous, faithful heart; There’s a Mansion and a welcome, and a multitude is there, Who have met upon the level and been tried upon ~the square. 183"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"1184 Let us meet upon the level, then, while laboring patient here,— Let us meet and let us labor, though the Labor seems severe.

That dream found me happy, by tried friends sar• rounded, Enjoying with rapture the comforts of wealth; My cup overflowing with blessings unbounded, My heart fully charged from the fountains of health. That dream left me wretched, by friendship forsaken Dejected, despairing, and wrapt in dismay; By poverty, sickness, and ruin o ‘ertaken, To every temptation and passion a prey; Devoid of an end or an aim, I then wandered O’er highway and by-way and lone wilderness; On the past and the present and fataTe I pondered, But pride bade me tender no sign of distress. [n frenzy the wine cup I instantly quaffed at; And habit and time made me quaff to excess; But heated by wine, Like a madman, I laughed at The thought of e’er giving the sign of distress. Bat wine sank me lower by lying pretenses, It tattered my raiment and furrowed my face, It palsied my sinews and pilfered my senses, And forced me to proffer a sign of distress. I reeled to a chapel, where churchmen were kneeling, And asking their Savior poor sinners to bless; My claim I presented—the door of that chapel Was slammed in my face at the sign of distress; I strolled to the priest, to the servant of Heaven, And sued for relief, with wild eagerness; He prayed that my BulB might at last be forgiven,~ And thought he had answered my sign of distress. I staggered at last to the home of my mother, Believing my prayers there would meet with success, Bat father and mother and sister and brother Disowned me, and taunted my sign of distress. T lay down to die, a Btranger drew nigh me, A spotless white lambskin adorning his dress; My eye caught the emblem, and ere he passed by me T gave, as before, the sign of distress. 187 With godlike emotion that messenger hastens To grasp me, and whisper, “My brother, I bless The bouT of my life when I learned of the Masons To give and to answer your sign of distress.’’ Let a sign of distress by a craftman be given, And though priceless to me is eternity’s bliss, May my name never enter the records of Heaven Should I fail to acknowledge that sign of distress. —Anon.

Es it the lease of Life, and nothing more, When the years have come to the triple score? Is it only the close of a Winter’s day, Where the sunshine fades in the West away? Is it only the tip of the mountain crest Where the lingering rays of the sunligh’t rest; And where, through the mists of the Past are seen The ghosts of the joys that once have been; j While down in the valley, far below, Lie the graves of the things of Long Ago? Nay, nay. Not that. For he who holds By the simple faith that the World enfolds, Finds, unto Life’s last, feeblest spark, That the daylight far exceeds the dark; That the Seasons bring, as they glide away, More days of brightness than days of gray; That the Spring gives place, in its varying moods, To the mellowing tints of the Autumn woods; And stars come out in the evening air, Which we fail to see in the noonday glare. As the day dies out with a golden gleam, And the red West glows with its parting heam. So would I, friends, when it comes my lot, Wish to depart thus calmly, and not As the O]d Year passes, sad and slow, Wrapped in the shroud of the Winter’s snow, But the rather in twilight, fair and clear, Where the quivering discs of the staTs appear.

B.), somewhat of your motives in applying for admissiou into our ancient and honorable Fraternity, we have learned from the declaration, over your signature, contained in your petition; but, in order that you may not be misled as to the character or the purpose of the ceremonies in which you are about to engage, the Lodge addresses to you these preliminary words of advice: Freemasonry is far removed from all that is triv - ial, selfish and ungodly. Its structure is built upon 197 ~he everlasting foundation of that God-giveir law— the Brotherhood of man—in the family whose Father is God. Our ~ancient and honorable Fraternity wel - comes to its doors, and admits to its privileges, worthy men of all creeds and of every race but insists that all men shall stand upon an exact- equality, and re - ceive its ins)ructions in a spirit of due humility, em - phasizing in demeanor, in conduct, in ceremony and in language, the helpless, groping r~ature of man at his birth, an~l his need of reliance upon Divine guid - ance through all the transactions ,of life. You will here be taught to divest your mind and conscience of all the vices and superfluities of life, and the Lodge into which you are now to be admitted expects you to divest yourself of all those worldly distinctions and equipments which are not in keeping with the humble, reverent and childlike attitude it is now your duty to assume, as all have done who have gone this way before you.

Here in this house of God, this temple of brotherly love, and around this sacred Altar, we make our fraternal vows.

Adopting no particular creed, forbidding sectarian discussion within its Lodge-rooms, encourag - ing each to be steadfast in the faith of his acceptance, Freemasonry takes all good men by the hand, and, leading them to its Altars, points to the open Bible thereon, and urges upon each that he faithfully direct his steps through life by the Light he there shall find, and as he there shall find it. If from our sacred Altars the atheist, the infidel, the irreligious man, or the libertine shou]d ever be able to wrest this Book of Sacred Laws, and thus remove, or even obscure, the greatest Light in Masonry —that light which has for ccnturies been the rule and guide of Freemasons—then could we no longer claim for ourselves the great rank and title of Free and Accepted Masons. But so long as that Sacred Light shines upon our Altars, so long as it illuminates the pathway of the Craftsmen by the golden rays of truth, so long and no longer can Freemasonry live and shed its beneficent influence upon mankind. Guard, then, that Book of sacred and immutable law as you would guard your very life. Defend it as yau would defend the flag of your country. Live according to its divine teachings, with its everlasting assurance of a blessed immortality. (Steps back and advances.) CHARGE TO A CLERGYMAN. If tlie Candidate be a Clergyman, the Following May be Added to the Charge an the First Degree. You, brother, are a preacher of that religion, of which the distinguishing characteristics are universal henevolence and unbounded charity. You cannot, therefore, but be fond of the Order, and zealous for the interest of Freemasonry, which, in the strongest manner, inculcates the same charity and benevolence, and which, like that religion, encourages every moral and social virtue; which introduces peace and good will among mankind, and is the center of union te those who otherwise might have remained at a per. petual distance. So that whoever is warmed with the spirit of Christianity, must esteem, mast love Free - masonry. Such is the nature.of our institution, that, in all our Lodges, union is cemented by sincere- attachment, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown, and pleasure is reciprocally communicated by the cheerful observance of every obliging office. Virtue, the grand object in view, luminous as the meridian sun, shines refulgent on the mind, enlivens the heart, and con - verts cool approbation into warm sympathy and cor - dial affection. Though every man, who carefully listens to the dictates of reason, may arrive at a clear persuasion of the beauty and necessity of virtue, both public and private, yet it is a full recommendation of a society to have these’ pursuits continually in view, as the sole objects of their association; and these are the laud. able bonds which unite us in one indissoluble fra - ternity. SYMBOLISM OF THE FIRST DEGREE Which May be Given After the Charge. The first, or E. A. degree of Masonry, is intended, symbolically, to represent the entrance of man into the world, in which he is afterwards to become a liv - ing and thinking actor. Coming from the ignorance and darkness of the outer world, his first craving is for light—not that physical light which springs from the great orb of day as its fountain, but that moral and intellectual light which emanates from the primal Source of all things—from the Grand Architect of the Universe—the Creator of the sun and of all that it illuminates.—Hencc the great, the primary object - -- ~ — ~I hEEL"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"206 207 CLOSING PRAYERS.

SYNThOLISM OF THE SEQOND DEGREE Which May be Given After the Charge. If the object of the first degree be to symbolize the struggles of a candidate groping in darkness for intellectual light, that of the second degree repre - [; sents the same candidate laboring amid all the diffi - culties that encumber the young beginner in the attainment of learning and science. The Entered Apprentice is to emerge from darkness to light—the Fellow Craft is to come out of ignorance into knowl - edge. This degree, therefore, by fitting emblems, is intended to typify these struggles of the ardent mind f or the attainment of truth—moral and intellectual truth—and, above all, that Divine truth, the compre - hension of which surpasseth human understanding, and to which, standing in the middle chamber, after his laborious ascent of the winding stairs, he can only approximate by the reception of an imperfect and yet glorious reward, in the revelation of that ‘‘hieroglyphic light which only Craftsmen ever saw.” CHARGE AT OPENING. The ways of Virtue are beautiful. Knowledge is attained by degrees. Wudom dwells with contempla - tion. There we must seek her. Let us then, brethren, apply ourselves with becoming zeal to the practice of the ercellent principles inculcated by the Craft. Let us ever remember that the great objects of our Fra - ternity are the restraint of improper desires and pas - sions, the cultivation of an active benevolence, and the promotion of a correct knowledge of the duties we owe to God, our neighbor, and ourselves. Let uu be united, and practice with assiduity the sacred tenets of the Craft. Let all private animosities, if any unhappily exist, give place to affection and brotherly love. It is a useless parade to talk of the subjection of irregular passions within the walls of the Lodge if we permit them to triumph in our inter - course with each other. Uniting in the grand design, let us be happy ourselves, and endeavor to promote the happiness of others. Let us cultivate the great moral virtues which arc laid down on our Masonic Trestle-board and improve in everything that is good, amiable, and useful. Let the benign Genius of the Mystic Art preside over our councils, and under her sway let us act with a dignity becoming the high moral character of our venerable institution.
