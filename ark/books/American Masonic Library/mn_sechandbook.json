LIST OF LODGES MASONIC This publication is distributed to all Constituent Lodges by the Grand Lodge of Minnesota each year. This book should be kept by the Lodge Secretary for reference in receiving visitors, and on receiving applications for affiliation. Through the use of this book the Secretary can determine if a visitor or one wishing to affiliate is a member of a recognized Lodge. The first ten pages in the \"List of Lodges Masonic\" have information concerning the law and the practices of other Grand Jurisdictions readily available. This information is invaluable and every Lodge Secretary should become familiar with this publication. The \"List of Lodges Masonic\" is published annually and is made available by the Grand Lodge of Minnesota at no cost to the Lodges. HANDBOOK OF FORMS AND PETITIONS During the 1991 Annual communication a resolution was adopted to remove all of the sample forms from the Masonic Code and issue them as a \"HANDBOOK OF FORMS AND PETITIONS\" in a loose-leaf binder. Every Lodge Secretary has been issued a forms manual. It should be kept in a safe, convenient location. This manual may be used to duplicate the particular form needed. Any forms duplicated should be on Lodge stationery, with the exception of Petitions and Demits."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF A LODGE SECRETARY 1.

NO DEMIT IS ISSUED (Article IX, Section C9.04(j), Minnesota Masonic Code) FOR REINSTATEMENT (After suspension for nonpayment of dues) A Petition for reinstatement is found in the \"Forms Handbook.\" Since the Petitioner was suspended for one reason or another, he will NOT have a Demit, Certificate of Non - Affiliation or Certificate of Good Standing to accompany the Petition. He must pay the Lodge whatever he was delinquent at the time he was suspended, and also the current years dues. He cannot buy back the time he lost while suspended. If it is within a year of his being suspended, he does not have to repetition and the Lodge does not have to investigate him again. Because the minutes state that he had been suspended, it will be necessary that the minutes show that he was reinstated and the date. If after one year, he does have to repetition, be investigated, and voted on in the usual manner. Upon reinstatement the member retains his original register number. (Article IX, Section G9.08, Minnesota Masonic Code) FOR RESTORATION After expulsion, the procedure for restoration shall be by written request to Grand Lodge, at least thirty (30) days before the Annual Communication, using the form on page 28 of the Forms Handbook.

(Same reference as above) If a petition is received from someone who has been rejected by another Lodge, Section G14.11, will apply.

WITHDRAWAL OF PETITION Any form of petition, legally received, may be withdrawn by written request of the petitioner, signed by him. It is not necessary that he state his reasons. (Article 14, Section C14.09, Minnesota Masonic Code ) COURTESY WORK When an elected petitioner, an Entered Apprentice, or Fellow Craft leaves the Jurisdiction and requests to continue his Masonic education, and wishes to do so in a Lodge in Minnesota, courtesy work may be arranged upon the certified request from the Lodge in which the candidate was elected. Generally the Masters of the Lodges concerned mutually agree to such requests in writing. In case the request is to a Lodge outside of the Grand Jurisdiction of Minnesota, such request must be approved by the Grand Master arid pass through the Grand Secretary's offices in each Jurisdiction that is involved. (Article 9, Section C9.18(b), Minnesota Masonic Code) WAIVER OF JURISDICTION Should a man living in another Jurisdiction, or having moved into this Jurisdiction after having taken some degrees in another Jurisdiction, wishes to petition a Lodge for Degrees, or Affiliation for the purpose of continuing his Degrees, a Waiver of Jurisdiction from the other Jurisdiction is necessary. The Request For a Waiver of Jurisdiction form on page 51 of the Forms Handbook should be forwarded through the Grand Lodge Office for transmittal to the other Jurisdiction involved. When the Waiver is received, the Petition would be handled in the usual manner.

The Lodge may grant additional time for cause shown, and the same shall be recorded in the minutes of the Lodge. As before, all information must be completed and the Petition must be recommended by two (2) Brothers, one of whom must be a member of the Lodge being Petitioned. The fee for the Fellow Craft or Master Mason Degree must accompany the Petition. The Petition must again be investigated and voted on as before. If rejected, the fee must be returned to the Petitioner along with the notice of rejection. (Article 14, Section G14.08, Minnesota Masonic Code) (Petition for Further Degree Work is in the Forms Handbook) DEMITS APPLICATION FOR A DEMIT Any Master Mason in good standing, except the Master and Wardens if clear on the books, may apply either to the Secretary, in writing, or orally to the Lodge, at a Stated Communication for a Demit. Same shall be granted if clear on the books and there are no other charges pending, upon such request. A request for a Demit must be acted upon at a Stated Communication and noted in the minutes. If a request, in writing, for a Demit is in the hands of the Secretary on or before December 31st, the applicant is entitled to his Demit, if clear on the books, back dated to December 31st, even though it cannot be acted upon until after January 1st, when Lodge dues are due and payable. The Demit may be back dated in order to avoid the Lodge having to pay per capita for the next year. (Article XVI, Sections G16.01 and G16.03, Minnesota Masonic Code) 5"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP If a Master Mason desires to transfer his Masonic membership from one Minnesota Lodge to another Lodge in Minnesota, it is recommended that he obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from his Lodge to submit with his Petition for Affiliation to the Lodge of his choice. The Lodge receiving the Petition must read the Petition and take no action until the next Stated Communication, at which time a ballot is taken. Upon a vote of the Lodge being Petitioned, it is not necessary to investigate the member. If elected, it is the responsibility of the Secretary of the Lodge petitioned to request a Demit from the former Lodge to complete the transfer. If rejected, the rejection must be endorsed on the margin of the Certificate of Good Standing and returned to the issuing Lodge. As no Demit was issued, his membership will continue in the original Lodge. (Article XVI, Sections G14.04 and G16.01, Minnesota Masonic Code) WITHDRAWAL FROM MEMBERSHIP When a Master Mason wishes to withdraw his membership, he may do so, if in good standing and clear on the books, by written notice filed with the Secretary, and read in Lodge at its next Stated Communication. Such request shall be disposed of in the same manner as an application for Demit, and show that the Brother was dropped from the rolls at his own request A DEMIT IS NOT ISSUED He will then be an Unaffiliated Mason, with no rights except to petition Grand Lodge for restoration, and to defend himself against any charges of unmasonic conduct subsequently made against him, for which he will be as subject to discipline after, as he was before withdrawal. (Article XVI, Section G16.06, Minnesota Masonic Code) WITHDRAWAL FROM DUAL OR PLURAL MEMBERSHIP Anyone who is a dual member and desires to retain only one such membership, may withdraw his membership in one of the Lodges by notifying that Lodge in writing of his intention to withdraw his membership. He must also notify the Lodge he wishes to continue his membership in that he has withdrawn his membership in the other Lodge. The Annual Dues Card from the Lodge being withdrawn from must be returned to the Lodge at the time the notice is given He must be in good standing in both Lodges at the time of withdrawal. The request must be granted with the approval of the Lodge, and so recorded in the Lodge minutes. NO DEMIT IS ISSUED UPON THE WITHDRAWAL OF A DUAL MEMBERSHIP! (Article IX, Section C9.04(j), Minnesota Masonic Code ) 6"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CERTIFICATE OF GOOD STANDING As explained under \"Transfer of Membership\", Certificates of Good Standing are to be used in the transfer of one's membership without first terminating his present membership. Certificates of Good Standing are not to be granted later than the last Stated Communication in October, nor shall one be received later than the first Stated Communication in November of the same year. This is to allow sufficient time to complete a transfer of membership by the end of the calendar year. (Article XVI, Section G16.01, Minnesota Masonic Code) SPECIAL NOTE Always keep in mind that Certificates of Good Standing or Intention to Transfer DO NOT complete the transfer of membership! Only the issuing of a DEMIT does, and it has to be requested by the electing Lodge and/or the member. If not requested, the member remains on the rolls of both Lodges and is responsible for the payment of dues in both Lodges. REINSTATEMENT The procedure to follow when a member suspended for nonpayment of dues (NPD) asks to be reinstated, can follow two courses: FIRST, the member may petition for reinstatement in the usual manner. (See the Petition For Reinstatement form on page 41 of the Forms Manual) In this case, the member would have to be investigated, voted on and restored to membership in his original Lodge. SECOND, the member may submit a request for a Certificate of Nonaffiliation or a Demit from the Lodge, after paying everything due the Lodge. (See Page 43 of the Forms Manual and Section G14.04, Page 76 MMC) Either form will do the same thing. In this case, the member would NOT have to be investigated to receive the form, as long as he was clear on the books. He may take the Certificate of Nonaffiliation, or the Demit, and petition any Lodge of his choice. That Lodge would then have to investigate him before balloting on him. COLLECTION REPORTS For convenience sake, we have combined the \"Raising Report\" and the \"Collection Report\" into one report form which incorporates all of the necessary information on one form. The Collection Report now includes space for the Raising Date and the Spouse's name. The form is printed from the Grand Lodge database and may be photocopied as often as needed. Contact the Grand Lodge office if you need a new original. 7"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Each newly raised member or affiliated member from another Jurisdiction shall pay a one time assessment of $12.50 for the benefit of the Minnesota Masonic Home, and $5.00 for the benefit of the George Washington Masonic National Monument, unless already paid to another Jurisdiction. This report must be submitted on or before the first day of each month following their collections together with your remittance. ANNUAL GRAND LODGE REPORTS PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE COMPLETING THE FORM . ANNUAL RETURNS \"It shall be the duty of each Lodge to make and forward an Annual Return of its membership and financial condition said returns must be in the office of the Grand Secretary by January 15th, of each year. If late, the Lodge will not be paid mileage and per diem to its Representative for attendance at the Grand Lodge Communication in March or April. Only the Grand Master may grant an extension of time. (Article XIII, Section G13.35, Minnesota Masonic Code) The Annual Return forms are sent in October r November to the Secretary of each Chartered Lodge. Four blank forms are sent; one or two completed forms are to be returned to the Grand Lodge Office by January 15th, one for the Lodge files, and one to be used as a work sheet for the following Lodge year. The information supplied on each Annual Return is transferred to the Master Register (Grand Lodge database) in the Grand Lodge Office. Therefore, every effort must be taken to assure accuracy when preparing the Return. Some basic information will be supplied on the form before you receive it, including the total membership as of the previous year ending December 31st. THIS NUMBER MUST NOT BE CHANGED This is the total number of members that per capita to be paid is based on, the previous year ending membership total. The total per capita will have been figured and included on the form prior to being mailed. Lodges having raised Master Masons will also have to include Degree Fees of $8.00 for each newly raised Master Mason.

The Secretary's address should be the mailing address where he wishes to have Lodge mail sent. When possible, include both home and business telephone numbers. On page 3, be certain the form is dated and the proper signatures, as well as the SEAL of the Lodge, are affixed. On this page there is also space for an abbreviated financial statement, showing Lodge assets and liabilities, as well as the total of unpaid Lodge dues owed to the Lodge. The MEMBERSHIP REPORT section on page 4 is simply the recording of totals and determining what the total membership count is as of December 31st of each year. The FINANCIAL ACCOUNT-DEGREE FEES area includes the number of Raisings at $8.00. (Article III, Section G3.01(c), Minnesota Masonic Code), along with the per capita for the number of members on record as of January 1st of the year just ended. This amount is to be included with the Annual Return forms when they are submitted to the Grand Lodge. On the statistical side of the form: All transactions involving the membership changes are to be itemized on this side of the form. The upper most area is used to report all Raisings, Affiliations, and Degree work, and it is helpful to have the information in chronological order (by date). Be very careful to always use FULL NAMES not nicknames or initials. On the lower left side of the form is an area for listing members RESTORED to membership. This would usually include members who had been suspended for NPD. The total of the Raisings, Affiliations, and Restored members are the totals used in the GAINS section in the Membership Report. The balance of the lower left and right side of the form are used to report all losses due to Withdrawn, Stricken, Suspended, Deaths, and Expelled members. It is helpful if the Deaths can be listed alphabetically.

Said Fifty (50) years must have been continuous or cumulative, and in \"Good Standing.\" Requisition forms are available from the Grand Lodge Office. Requests should be made at least sixty (60) days in advance of the planned presentation date. This will allow the Grand Lodge office sufficient time to research the records to determine that the recipient is eligible. Many times it is necessary to write to other Grand Jurisdictions to verify dates, etc., and this takes time. But we will try to accommodate all requests however timely they be. Should the recipient reside outside of the area of his Lodge and is not planning to attend the presentation, arrangements will be made through the Grand Lodge for a courtesy presentation, either within Minnesota or out of State. If it is to be a courtesy presentation, we must have the member's current address so proper arrangements may be made for the presentation. It is sometimes desirable to present the Awards prior to the actual anniversary date, often due to illness or the availability of the recipient. If the presentation date is within a year of the actual anniversary date, a written request for a dispensation from the Grand Master for an early presentation is necessary. Awards are normally sent to the Grand Lodge District Representative for the Lodge, and it is the responsibility of the Lodge to arrange with him early enough for a mutually convenient date for the presentation. 10"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"BY-LAWS AND AMENDMENTS If the By-laws of your Lodge can not be located, or date back to the origin of the Lodge, it may be possible that the Lodge would want to consider approving a completely new set of By-laws. A sample set of By-laws can be found on page 59-64 in the Handbook of Forms and Petitions. We suggest that you first read Article 13, Section G13.32, page 73 of the Minnesota Masonic Code, which outlines the only proper and correct procedure to follow. When a proposal is presented to amend your Lodge's By-laws, it must first be proposed in writing, by Article and Section, and read at open Lodge a first time. At this time the proposal requires only a simple majority vote in favor by those present. Should the proposal receive the necessary majority vote, the Secretary shall forward one copy to the Grand Secretary who shall forward it to the Jurisprudence Committee for approval as to form only, or correction if necessary. Upon the return of the proposal by a member of the Jurisprudence Committee through the Grand Secretary's office, it shall be read a second time to the Lodge at the next Stated Communication. No action is to be taken at this meeting other than to lay the proposal over until the following Stated Communication. At least five (5) days before the subsequent Stated Communication, at which time the final vote is to be taken, a notice by mail MUST be sent to every member at his last known address, with a sufficient summary of the proposal to allow him to understand what the change is, and the date when the final vote is to be taken. If the Lodge has a newsletter, a notice in such newsletter would be sufficient notification. At the Stated Communication, when the final action is to be taken, the proposal is again read for the third time and must receive a two-thirds (2/3) vote in favor by those present and entitled to vote to be adopted, subject to the final approval of the Grand Master. The Grand Secretary shall have forwarded two (2) copies of the Certificate for Approval form for the Lodge Secretary to complete and return, along with a copy of the notification sent to the member for the final approval of the Grand Master. When a new set of By-laws is proposed for adoption, the same procedure as required for amendments shall apply.

The Investigation Reports are NOT to be retained, nor are the names of the committeemen ever to be recorded. Cash receipts journals should be kept as should the cash disbursement journals. However, the supporting bills and receipts need not be retained for more than seven (7) years, so long as proper record has been made in the proper journal for all items involved. It is always good practice to clear your files periodically of excess materials, so long as they are no longer relevant to the proper operation of the Lodge.
