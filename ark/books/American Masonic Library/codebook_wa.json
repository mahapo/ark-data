It was tasked especi ally to correct any typographical or omission errors, and to modify any language in the Code that was unclear, assuring that these changes remained faithful to the original intent. Thei r charge was similar to that given the 1980-83 Commission, “ . . . by restructuring and rewriting th e accumulated material . . . every member of the Constituent Lodges throughout Washington Jurisd iction will find the Code’s wisdom readily accessible and understandable.” The 1983 Code had required nearly three years to complete and was a most worthy product. However, by 2001, the Code had not undergone a comprehensive review for nearly two decades, and the intervening years of legislative modificati ons had materially impaired the Code’s clarity, consistency, and usability. Understandably, in the Spring of 2000 The Grand Lodge Long Range Strategic Plan identified making the Code more “user friendly” as one of the Jurisdiction’s primary goals. To that end, the Code Commissi on remained essentially in tact for two successive Grand Lodge years, 2001 to 2003. Thanks to the application of modern technology, the Commission completed a draft revision of th e Code in less than one year, allowing an extensive period for review and comment by the membership. The Code Commission has spent many hours at the ta sk and the revision presented here is the result of that effort. This revised Code is characteristically a work in progress. As the Commission completed its efforts, it acknowledged th at several areas in the Code will require more complete study. However, both the Code Commission and the Jurisprudence Committee agree this new Code warranted acceptance, a nd it was adopted at the 2003 Grand Lodge Session in Tacoma. M ∴ W ∴ Robert L.

Historical Changes The Constitutional Convention of December 6-8, 1858, at which was formed “The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Washington,” adopted a Constitution which in due time would be expanded as a compilation of Masonic laws and be known as the Washington Masonic Code. The compilation was revised frequently and in 1929, after seventy-one years, had undergone seven re-printings and was due for its eighth. In that year, the delegates to the Seventy-second Annual Communication foresaw the need to guard against potential degrading of the literary quality of the Code. Permanent legislation wa s approved authorizing the designation of the Jurisprudence Committee as a Special Code Co mmission charged with the maintenance of the Code In 1973, deficiencies in the structure and compos ition of the Code had increased to a serious degree. To maintain the quality of the Code, ne w legislation was adopted authorizing the Grand Master to annually appoint an independent Code Commission. Code Commissions were appointed in 1975 and again in 1976 for the purpose of beginning the work of restoring the high quality of the Code. The initial studies revealed the great magnitude and extreme difficulty of the project. The studies were to be helpful by forewarning subsequent Commissions of the extraordinary effort and skill that would be required. M ∴ W ∴ Wayne A. Sparger in 1980 directed the C ode Commission to revise and clarify the Washington Masonic Code. M ∴ W ∴ Herbert M. Edman reappointed the Commission in 1981 with this comment: “The work you are doing is very important and long overdue.” M ∴ W ∴ George R. Bordewick, after examining a prelim inary draft of the Code clarification in 1982 and approving plans for reviews by th e Committee on Jurisprudence and by the Constituent Lodges, expressed hope that dele gates to the 1983 Annual Communication would accept and approve “this monumental work.” The 1983 Edition of the Washington Masonic Code was adopted at the 126 th Annual Communication of Grand Lodge, June 1983. M ∴ W ∴ Robert L. Van Zee in 2001 charges the Code Commission to perform a complete review of the Washington Masonic Code. During this process, the Code Commission were to make any revisions and restructuring necessary to make the Code more accessible and understandable to the Craft. Considering the Washington Masonic Code had not had a complete review in 18 years the time for the change was due. The 2003 Edition of the Washington Masonic Code to be presented to the delegates at the 145 th Annual Communication of Grand Lodge June 2002 for their consideration and action by the Grand Lodge by the next Annual Communication in June 2003.

Most have heard the admonition to the Worshipful Master at installa tion to “Cause (the Book of Constitutions) to be read in your Lodge that none may pretend ignoran ce of the excellent precepts which it enjoins.” It follows logically that every member is entitled to understand what the laws of Masonry require of him and his Brethren. The objective of the Code Commission of 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 has been to bring the Washington Masonic Code into an elevated stat e of usefulness by restructuring and rewriting the accumulated material so that every member of Constituent Lodges throughout the Washington Jurisdiction will find the Code’s wisdom readily accessible and understandable.

I. THE MANUSCRIPT OLD CHARGES From the Thom as W . Tew MS, circa 1680 1* THE CHARGES Every Man that is a Mason take heed right well & wi sely to this Charge, if that you find Your Self Guilty of any of these that You Am end them if you be Against God & Principality’s for they that he Charged m ust take heed that m ay keep thes e Charges: f or it is Great Peril to f oreswear Him self upon the book. 2 1stly The first charge is that you shall be true m en to God and to the holy Church, that you use no heresie or Error to Your understanding or discreet Men Teaching 3 3dly And also You shall be true Each one to Other, that is to say to Every Master and f fellow of the Craft of Masonry that be Masons Allowed, 4 And doe you to them as you would they should do to you. 1 From an unknown date pr ior to the 15 th centur y to an unknown date in the 18 th , when a m an was m ade a br other of our Frater nity , a long legendar y histor y of Masonry was read to him from a m anuscrip t called the Book of Constitutions (Latin constituito , a founding or iginating) , after which one of the elder s held the Bible, and the candidate placed his hand upon it and received “ his charge.” This char ge, though probably originally a distinct docum ent, and older than the legendar y histor y, was, dur ing the per iod m entioned, annexed to the nar rative and r ead fr om the sam e book, Of the M SS, used on these occasions, which are our most im por tant sour ce of knowledge in r egar d to the laws and us ages of our ancient br ethr en, near ly seventy ar e now known to be in existence, and we possess printed copies of a few others which have been lost. Of the form er, one (exclusive of Regius or Halliwell poem ) was copied from an earlier MS, early in the 15 th century, one late in the 16 th (1583) , thir ty-nine in the 17 th , twenty-one in the 18 th , and a f ew in the 19 th centur y. They differ am ong them selves in m any im por tant as well as unim portant particulars; and a full acc ount of each MS will be found in the 1895 edition of HUGHAN ’ S “Old Char ges. ” For the sake of convenience they have been nam ed, and classified into fam ilies and branches. The version of the Ch arges given in the “ Tew MS.” Has been sel ected for printing in this Code for several reasons: It is one not particularly accessible to Am erican students: it bears a very close resem blance to one used by D R . A NDERSON in preparing the ver sion pr inted in Appendix C; it fair ly pr esents the law as it existed just pr ior to the Gr and L odge er a; and it is consider ed by Br other s HUGHAN and BEGEMANN (then whom none stand higher in this br anch of study ) one of the m ost im por tant of all ver sions. The for mer say s (“ Old Charges ” 2d ed. , 105) : “Unquestionably , the Roll is one of the valu able of the ver sions, other than the ‘ Regius, ’ ‘Cooke’ and the ‘ Plot Fam ily of M SS, it being closely related to the last m entioned and a connecting line between the ‘William Watson’ and the later Fam ilies.” Dr. B EGEMANN (in th e “ Zirkel- Correspondenz ,” as translated by Bro. G.W. S PETH in “ Art Quatuor Coronatorum, ” ix, 20) says: “Fir st of all the author of the Cooke M S. Com piled with the help of ‘ Old Booky s of the Char ges” and the cur rent histor ies of hi s tim e, about 1410, a Histor y of Masonry : this was revised and expanded a bout 1480 into a version which served as a m odel for the W illiam W atson MS.: about 1520 or 1530 this was again revised and condensed into a ver sion of which the T ew M S. M ay be consider ed an exam ple: this was fur ther revised and por tions o mitted to give us the version to which the Atcheson- Haven, Buchanan and Beaum ont M SS. Belong: then cam e a last r evision which pr oduced the par ent for m of the m ajority of the manuscripts known to us, and which belong par tly to the Sloane and partly to the Gra nd Lodge Fam ilies: from the first sprang la ter the Roterts fam ily, and from the second the y oungest gr oup of all, the Spencer fam ily .” With the rem ark that these revi sions affected the historical narrative m ore than the Charges proper, we will add that the Tew M S. Is a scroll, com posed of three strips of parchm ent, over six inches in breadth and six and one-half feet in length, contains 280 lines of writing and wa s copied about the y ear 1680 by a scr ibe who appear s to have taken consider able pains with his wor k. It does not cont ain the “ new Articles” or the “ Apprentice Ch arge;” and the “Char ges Singuler ” after the “121y ” ar e not num ber ed. “—y t he am end him self towar ds God & pr incipally you y t. be char ged take good heed, ” etc. – Hugban MS ., cir ca 1680. 2 # This whole introduction is wanting in m any MSS., and it was pr obably originally not in writing. Yet, for the picture it gives of the old m anner of wor king, a longer ver sion m ay be wor th pr inting, viz: “It as likewise or dained y t when any m ason should be m ade y t th e saide book should be r ead to him , & his Char ge given him , whic h he was to keep inviolably with an oath then to be adm inistered to him . “T hese Char ges which we now r eher se to y ou & all other ye secr ets & m ister ys belonging to fr ee m asons y ou shall faithfully & truly keep, together with y e Counsell of y e Assem bly or lodge, or any ot her lodge, or br other , or fellow. You shall not for any gift, or br ibe, or rewar d, favour , or affection, dir rectly or indir ectly , for any Cause whatsoever , devolge y e sam e to father or m other , br other or sister , son or daughter , wife, kindr ed, or relation, or any other per son whatsoever , so help m e God, ye hold lor d & the sentence of this book. • Then after y e oath taken & thje book kissed, ye following precepts & charges, which he or they are to keep, are to be read.” – Du mfries Kilwin ning MS. No . 3, cir ca 1690. 3 W e know of no ver sion of this last clause that is sm ooth E nglish; but the idea is evident: that they ar e not to r ely upon thei r own under standing of r eligious matters, but are to be governed by the t eachings of wise and discreet m en – a fa vorite doctrine of the m edieval Church."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 2        4ly Also that Every Mason keep Councill both of L odge & Chamber, and of the Craft and all other councells that ought to be kept by way of Masonry. 5thly Also that no Mason shall be a thief of Accessory to the thief as far forth as You doe know. 6ly Also that you be true men to the Lords & Mastrs that You serve and tr uly look so to his Profitt and Advantage. 7thly And also you shall Call Masons your Brethren or ffellows and by no other Foule names nor take your ffellow’s wife Unlawfully or Desire his Daughter Unlawfully or his Servt in Villany. 8thly And also that you pay truly for your table & for your Meat & Drink where you are Tabled. 9thly Also you shall Play no Villany in the Hous e where you are board whereby the Craft may be slandered. These be the Generall charges that Every Mason should hold both Mastrs and Fellows. 5 And these be the Charges Singuler for Master’s and Fellows. 1 st That no Master shall take 6 With the know himself Able in Cunning to Perform it, So that the Craft have no Slandr or disworship but that the Lord 7 may be well & truly served. 2ly Also that no Master take any work but that he take it reasonably so that the Lord may be truly served with his owne Good and that the Master may Live Honestly and Pay his ffellows truly as the Mannrs of the Craft Asketh. 3dly Also that no man that is a Master Mason or ffellow shall Supplant any other Man of his work (that is to say) if he have taken a Work of a Lord or Ma ster that you put him not out Unless he be not able in Cunning to Finish the Work. 4ly Also that no Master or ffellow take any Apprentice to be Allowed his Apprentice any longer than Seven Years 8 & that Apprentice to be of Able birth & kindred as he ought to be. 9 4 “Mason Allowed” was a technical expression equivalent to our “Free and Accepted Mas on,” distinguishing members of the Fraterni ty from mere stone- masons. 5 There is much variety in the form of th is sentence in the various versions. There has been much conjecture, but no certainty, as to the reason or theiry of the division of the Charges into two parts. One is, that one set of charges was for Masters of the Work only, and the other for bot h Masters and Fellows. A more probably one is that there was a theory that the “General Charges” had been prescribed – or, more probably, examined and approv ed – by the civil authority; while the “Charges Singuler” were made “at divers congregati ons by the good advice of Masters and Fellows,” under the favorite Masonic claim of the right of self-government. See Ars O.C., vii, 127, note 4, 131. 6 “that noe Master or ffellow take,” etc. – William Watson MS., 1687. 7 “Lord” means employer – the person for whom the work is done. 8 The Tew MS. is one of the very few versions which exactly reve rse the real rule, which was that the apprenticeship must not be for less than seven years, as will appear in the next note. 9 As in charges “4ly” and 5thly” our ancient brethren see down their idea of the Masonic law of physical qualification; and as m odern writers are not agreed as to what that law is, the Code Commission has endeavored to ascertain what the original form of thes e two charges, by a very car eful examination of all the versions of the MS. Charges with his reach – 63 in number, including all the more impor tant versions and all the versions excep t those known to scholars as C 3, D 10, D 23, D 26, D 28, D 35, D 39, E 12, E 14, F 4, G 3, H 3 and H 4, some of whic h are of little value and others are copies of versions included in the examination. From this examina tion he is satisfied that the 4 th charge originally read – spelling modernized – substantially as follows – the punctuation being important: “That no Master nor Fellow take no Apprentice but for seven years; and ye Apprentice to be able, of birth freeborn, and of limb s whole as a man ought to be.” Also, that through the errors of copyists, three classes of cha nges crept into some versions: First – not chronologically – the words “to be learned” were inserted after the word “Appren tice” where it first occurs; as in the Cooke MS ., circa 1430. These words were then corrupted (a) without changing their meaning, as in the Regius MS., circa 1390; and (b) with change of meaning, as into the words “to be allowed” in the Tew MS. S econd, the idea of the words “but for seven years” (Sm. Watson MS., 1687) was more clearly expr essed in some versions; as by, “for lasse terme than VII yer at the lest,” in the Cooke MS.; and was lost in a very few others, as in the Buchanan (circa 1670) and the Tew. Third, the last clause was read as if punctuate d thus: “And ye Apprentice to be able of birth, freeborn, and of limbs whole,” etc.; and the scri be wrote “able of birth, viz.: freeborn” and ot her expressions, in trying to make sense of the passage, notwithstanding the error due to e rroneous punctuation. “Able” probably meant th e same as “able in Cunning” in charge 3.

The law, whatever it was, was understood in at least f our different ways by the scribe, viz.: As forbidding one to ta ke permission [from whom?] (a.) to make Masons (Tew MS.); (b.) to be made a Mason (Watson MS.); and (c.) to be made a Maste r (Waistell MS., 1693); (d.) the Haddon MS. reads, “And also that no Master, nor no Fellow take nor allow any to be made Masons without.” etc. merely an attempt to “make crooked things straight.” The recently discovered Mcnab MS. (dated 1722) has, “You shall not take upon you to make an ey one Mason without ye privity & consent of 5 or 6 of your fellowes.” The Haddon M.S. instead of the consent of fiver or six – or six or seven – Fellows, demands the c onsent of Fellows “that hath s erved Six or Seven years at the least.” A few other versions practically agree with this. 11 By the comparison of versions mentioned in the sec ond note on charge “4ly” above, we reach these conclusions: First, that his charge is probably later than some others. Sec ond, that the original form of the latter, part of it was approxi mately as follows: “And that he that shall be made Mason be able, of degree freeborn and no bondsman, and that he have his right limbs as a man ou ght to have.” After this came to be read as though punctuated, “able of degree, freeborn,” etc., a variety of forms – “able in all manner of degrees” (Phillipps No. 1, circa 1680), “abell in all mainer of dewties” (Aberdeen MS., 1670), “a ble over all Sciences” (Alnwick MS., 1701), etc., - usually followed by the words (that is to day, freeborn,” etc., were deve loped to account for or explain the expression “able of degree.” 12 “His elder,” or “his elder fellow,” in most versions. 13 “Games.” There is considerably variet y in the different versions of this charge. Some say, “except at Christmas.” 14 There are many variations of this charge. Seven Mss. say five miles; three say seven; four, ten; one says thirty; two say fort y; and most of the others say fifty. Bro. HUGHAN considers the latter the true length of th e cabletow, but we think the rule differed in districts of different size. Most vers ions say “Every Master and Fellow” should come. “Gif (if) he has warning” is probably a gloss. “To st and there at Award” means, “to submit to t he award,” and is probably out of place in this charge, having crept in from the 14 th . The Assembly was the annual meeting of all the Ma sters and Fellows of the Neighborhood or district. It seems to have become obsolete in England before the Grand Lodge era. 15 As to “Master” see preceding note. Something has apparently dr opped out of this charge; but the idea was, that if controversy had arisen, or if one had trespassed against the Craft, the brethren were to try to settle the matter at the A ssembly; but if they failed, the manner was to be left to be settled by the laws of the land. See charge 20. 16 The wretched success which the tr anscribers of nearly every version of the MS. Charges had in attempting to copy his charge wo uld alone demonstrate that they were speculative Masons who did not know the meaning of the technical terms of the stone-masons’ trade which they transcri bed. Perhaps the Carson MS>, 1677, states the rule as accurately as any: “Also that no Master nor fellow, make Nor Rule nor Square, nor Mould to no Layer, nor to sett no Layer on worke, within the Lod ge or without to any Moulded Stones.” The word “Layer” – seen in the term “brick-layer” – referred to a workman who had not learned the tr ade and been admitted free of the craft – a profane. “Cowan” is sometimes used in the same connection. 17 Nearly every version has “when they come over the country,” or equivalent words. Every Grand Lodge regulation whic h refuses recognition to unaffilia ted Masons, or brothers of “unrecognized” jurisdictions, or Masons made according to the law of the place of their making but contrary to the regulations of the place they visit, is a direct violation of this very an cient charge."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 4 [20] And also that if any ffellows shall be at Disc ord you shall truly treat them to be Agreed shewing Favour to neither Party but Wisely & truly for both Partie s and that it be in such a time that the Lords work be not hindered.

Few versions mention a “Paymaster” or “Master’s Councell.” The words “Masts Councell” are printed “Mastr Councell” in HUGHAN ’ S “Old charges,” but by a typographical error, as Bro. HUGHHAN authorizes me to say. The expression doubtless means “order of the Master.” The Cooke MS. reads: “when he schalle take his pay that he take hit mekely as the tyme ys ordeynyd by the master to be done and that he fulfylle the accepcious of trauayle and of his rest y ordeyned and sett by the maister.” 20 The Cooke MS. indicates more clearly that if “discorde” arose the parties were to “be stylle” at the bidding of the Master unt il the “holy day folowynge,” when they were bound to “acorde” “at the dispocion of his felaus;” and that such Lodges of Conc iliation were to be held on Sund ays or other holidays, not on work days. 21 “Warden.” – Wm. Watson MS ., 1687. 22 “Alsoe if ye Stand Stewarde either of Lodge Chamber or of common house needs, ye Shall giue true account of ye ffellowes good how yt is dispensed, at what time they will take account.” – Wm. Watson MS. The last clause means “when they wish an accounting.” “Fellowe s good” means “fellows’ goods.” “Lodge (or Lord’s) Chamber or of common house” should doubtless read, “Lodge, chamber or common house.” Th e term “Steward” occurs in few versions. 23 “lese.” – Cooke MS.; “Spoile.” – Wm. Watson MS. 24 The Cooke MS. adds another reason: “that the more loue may encrese amonge hem.” 25 “Rehearsd.” – Hughan MS. 26 There is considerable variety, among the versions, in this concluding clause. The Cooke MS. ends abruptly, - “A MEN SO MOTE HIT BE .” The Buchanan MS., circa 1680, has: “These Charges that you haue Received you shall well and truly keepe, not disclosing th e Secresy of our Lodge to man, woman, no r child: Sticke nor stone; thing moueable nor immoueable, soe god you helpe and hiss holy Doome, Amen. ffinis.” "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 5   II.

A NDERSON was about to issue his Book of Constitutions (see first foot-note in appendix C), an enterprising publisher issued a book entitled – “The Old constitutions Belonging to the Ancient and Honourable So ciety of Free and Accepted Masons. Taken from an Manuscript wr ote about Five Hundred Years since. London: Printed and Sold by J. Roberts, in Warwick Lane. MDCCXXII.” This book contains the “Apprentice charges,” and the “New Articles” – therein styled “Additional Orders” – which were unknown t o the early MS. and were probably drawn up early in the 17 th century. Speaking of R OBERTS ’ book, Bro. W ILLIAM J AMES H UGHAN says: “The ‘Additional Orders and Constitutions’ are declared to have been ‘made and agreed upon at a General Assembly held at *** on the Eighth Day of December, 1663’ but evidently this guess was not explicit enough for Dr. Anderson, as he states in ‘Constitutions’ 1738, tha t the Earl of St. Albans ‘held a General Assembly and Feast on St. John’s Day, 27 th Dec., 1663’ (page101), when these regulations were made. One romance is as good or worthless as the other; and like the claim of Roberts, that th e MS. he copied from was then about 500 years old, is only quoted now to show how Masonic ‘History’ was written at that period.” – Old Charges (Ed., 1895), 122. “The ‘additional’ or ‘new’ articles appear to have been agreed to by some Company or body of Freemasons, having jurisdiction in one form or other over a number of Lodges, about which at the present time we are ab solutely without information, and which seems to have been in part of a speculative character. *** Dr. Anderson does not refer to these ‘Articles’ in 1723, but in the s econd edition of 1738 he gives them, in his own way, as the Regulations made on St. John’s Day, 27 th Dec., 1663. I think that the Roberts’ text was selected (and altered) by him accordingly.” – Id., 124. The MS. from which we quote in the text is considered the oldest in which these Articles are found. We have retained the number s which the articles bear in that MS. The reader will see from Bro. H UGHAN ’ S observations that these Articles, unlike most of the Charges proper, were not general laws for the government of the whole Fraternity, but were local regulations. 28 A NDERSON , in his version, altered the words “unless he shall have a Lodge of five free Masons att ye least,” “unless in a regular Lodge .” 29 A NDERSON changed this to “One Grand Master.” 30 Bro. E. C ONDER , J R ., has pointed out ( Hole Crafte and Fellowship of Masons , 11; and Ars. Q.C., ix. 39) the remarkable sim ilarity of this article to a rule of the Masonic Company of London, that the Company is to be ruled by Master, Wardens and Assistants, but we think he has not shown that the rule of the Company of which he is Mast er is older than Grand Lodge MS. No. 2 31 The oath is given in Harleian MS.

W arden Anderson pr oduced the new Book of Constitutions now in Pr int, which was again appr ov’ d, with the Addition of the antient Manner of Constituting a Lodge.” From the sam ples printed in Appe ndix B, the justness will, in part, be seen of the criticism contained in the “Approbation” mentioned below, that the manuscr ipt ver sions had been – “m uch inter polated, mangled, and m iser ably co rrupted, not only with false Spelling, but even with m any f alse Facts and gross Er rors in HISTORY and CHRONOLOGY , thr ough L ength of T ime, and the I gnor ance of TRANSCRIBERS , in the dark illiterate Ages , before the revival of G EOMETRY and ancient ARCHITECTURE , to the gr eat Offence of all the lear ned and judicious BRETHREN , whereby also the IGNORANT have been deceiv’d.” In the histor ical par t of his wor k, A NDERSON rather added to than dim inished the num ber of “fal se Facts and gross Errors.” How m uch, if any, better he succeeded in digesting the Charges – how cl osely he adhered to his originals and to what extent he m ade alterations, and inc orpor ated ideas of his own, - the r eader can judge by com paring the Char ges her e pr inted with t hose given in Appendix B.

So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State, he is not be countenanc’d in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy Man, and if convicted of no other Crime, though the loyal Brotherhood must and out to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time being; they cannot expel him from the Lodge and his Relation to it remains indefeasible. III. OF LODGES   . I. Concerning GOD and RELIGION 36 A Mason is oblig’d, by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid A THEIST , nor an irreligious L IBERTINE . But though in ancient Times Masons were charg’d in every Country to be of the Religi on of that Country or Nation, whatsoever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more expedient only to oblige themselves to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves; that is, to be G OOD M EN AND T RUE or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasions they may be distinguish’d; whereby Masonry becomes the C ENTER of U NION , and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must else have remain’d at a perpetual Distance. 37 II. Of the Civil Magistrate Supreme and Subordinate A L ODGE is a Place where M ASONS assemble and work; Hence that Assembly, or duly organiz’d Society of Masons, is call’d a Lodge, and every Brother ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its B Y -L AWS and the G ENERAL R EGULATIONS . 38 It is either P ARTICULAR or G ENERAL , and will be best understood by attending it, and by the Regulations of the G ENERAL or G RAND . Owing to its cheapness, legibility and convenient form, as well as to the sanction given it by Grand Lodge, this version quite generally – though not universally – superseded the manuscript versions in English Lodge s; and it served as a shibboleth and palladium to the brethren on the Continent who upheld the cause of pure ancient Masonry against the fanciful systems which over-ran Eu rope in the latter half of the eighteent h century. It is equally valuable in combatting in America numerous errors which gained a footing during a centu ry in which nearly all the history of Masonry was a sealed book even to our most earnest students. Indeed the greatness of our debt to ANDERSON ’ S version has created a school of writers, which is even yet exceedingly influential, which would make this version the touc h-stone even where it differs from the originals which it profes sed to digest – in other words, who place the authority of the printe d Charges of 1723 above that of the MS. Old Charges them selves. But, it seems to u s, to state this claim is to show its untenableness. In his second (1738) edition, Anders on made many changes in the Charges, thus s howing that he attached no peculiar sacredness t o his work, but considered it simply one version of the Old Charges of the Fraternity. Mo st of these changes we have deemed it unn ecessary to note, as the Fraternity has never considered them improvements, and few if any of them appear to have been based upon any authority other than A NDERSON ’ S taste. 36 Upon the fact that the name of God does not appear in this Charge – although it does in the corresponding charge of the MS. versions, - the Grand Orient of France, and some other bodies base their claim of a right to omit all reference to Him from their constitutions and r itual. 37 This charge seems to have met with some disapproval; and Bro. J OHN P ENNELL , in preparing the Book of Constitutions printed by the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1730, omitted all of it from the words “But though” to the word s “to themselves,” inclusive. In A NDERSON ’ S 1738 edition it was changed to read as follows: “A Mason is obliged by his Tenure to observe the Moral Law, as a true Noachida ; and if he rightly understands the Craft , he will never be a Stupid Atheist, nor an Irreligious Libertin, nor act against Conscience. “In Antient Times the Christian Masons were charged to comply with the Christian Usages of each Country wh ere they travell’d or work’d; But Masonry being found in all Nations, even of divers Religions, they are now only charged to adhere to that Religion in which all Men ag ree (leaving each Brother to his own particular Opinions) that is, to be Good Men and True, Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Names, Religio ns or Persuasions they may be distinguish’d;: For they all agree in the 3 great Articles of N OAH , enough to preserve the Cement of the Lodge. Thus Masonry is the Center of their Unior and the happy Means of conditioning Persons that otherwise must have remain’d at a perpetual Distance.” The latter form was in force when L AURENCE D ERMOTT published the first edition of his famous “A himan Rezon,” and was adopted by him, and thus became the law of the “Ancients” or “Athol” Masons. 38 Concerning this clause, which has been i nvoked as a justification for much coercive and unfraternal legislation, in recent tim es, against our unaffiliated brethren, see the Washington Co rrespondence Report of 1895, page 103, where it is pointed out that the clause “and every Brother ought to belong to one,” etc., although consistent with the spirit of Freemas onry, when regarded merely as a general rule, was not based upon anything in the MS. Old Charges, but was one of A NDERSON ’ S additions; also, that it has never been regarded, in th e Grand Lodge which approved it, as a mandate – to be enforced by penalties, - but as advisory only.

It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every Brother must attend in his Place, and learn them in a way peculiar to T HIS F RATERNITY : Only C ANDIDATES may know, that no M ASTER should take an Apprentice, unless he has sufficient Imployment fo r him, and unless he be a perfect Youth, having no Maim or Defect in his Body, that may render him uncapable of learning the Art, of serving his M ASTER ’ S L ORD , and of being made a B ROTHER , 40 and then a F ELLOW -C RAFT in due time, even after he has served such a Term of Years as the Custom of the Country directs; and that he should be descended of honest Parents; that so, when othe rwise qualify’d, he may a rrive to the Honour of being the W ARDEN , and then the M ASTER of the L ODGE , the G RAND W ARDEN , and at length the G RAND -M ASTER of all L ODGES , according to his Merit. 39 No footnote is printed, though one is indicated. 40 It will be noticed that at this time, 1723, - or even in 1738 – the apprentice of a Mason was not necessarilya “Brother” or “E ntered Apprentice.” Among the numerous changes in this Charge made by A NDERSON in 1738, was a clause reading, “and that, when of Age and Expert, he (the ‘Prentice’) may become an Enter’d Prentice , or a Free-Mason of the lowest Degree, and upon his due improvements a Fellow-Craft and a Master-Mason , capable to undertake a Lord’s Work.” Another change makes the Charge declare that, “The W ARDENS are chosen from among the Master - Masons ;” and that, in extr aordinary cases, one who has not been a Warden may be Master of a Lodge. Another declares, “But no Number without 3 Master - Masons can form a Lodge .” Another declares that the Grand Master must have been Master of a Lodge.

In the L ODGE while C ONSTITUTED If any complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the Award and Determination of the L ODGE , who are the proper and competent Judges of all such Controversies, (unless you carry it by A PPEAL to the G RAND L ODGE ) and to whom they ought to be referr’d, unless a L ORD ’ S W ORK be hinder’d the mean while, in which Case a particular Reference may be made; but you must never go to Law about what concerneth M ASONRY , without an absolute Necessity apparent to the L ODGE . 2. B EHAVIOR after the Lodge is over and the B RETHREN not gone. You may enjoy yourselves with innocent Mirth, treating one another according to Ability, but avoiding all Excess or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his Inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occasions call hi m, or doing or saying anything offensive, or that may forbid an EASY and FREE Conversation; for that would blast our Harmony, and defeat our laudable Purposes. Therefore no private Piques or Quarrels must be brought within the Door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about R ELIGION , or N ATIONS , or S TATE P OLICY , we being only, as M ASONS of the C ATHOLICK R ELIGION above mention’d; we are also of all N ATIONS , T ONGUES , K INDREDS , and L ANGUAGES , 41 and are resolv’d against A LL P OLITICKS , as what never yet conduc’d to the Welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. this C HARGE has been always strictly enjoin’d and observ’d; but especially 41 In the 1738 edition, this reads: “of all Nations upon the Square, Level and Plumb; and like our Predecessors in all Ages , we are resolv’d against political Disp utes, as contrary to the Peace and Welfare of the Lodge.” "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 5 But if you discover him to be a true and genuine B ROTHER , you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want, you must employ him some Da ys, or else recommend him to be employ’d.

I. THE GRAND-MASTER, or his DEPUTY, hath Authority and right, not only to be present in any true L ODGE , but also to preside wherever he is, with the M ASTER of the L ODGE on his Left- hand, and to order his G RAND -W ARDENS to attend Him , who are not to act in particular L ODGES as W ARDENS , but in his Presence, and at his Com mand; because there the G RAND -M ASTER ma y com mand the W ARDENS of that L ODGE , or any other Brethren he pl easeth, to attend and act as his W ARDENS P RO .

The M ASTER of a particular L ODGE has the Right and Authority of Congregating the Mem bers of his L ODGE into a C HAPTER at pleasure, upon any Em ergenc y or Occurrence, as well as to appoint the tim e and place of their usual form ing: And in case of Sickness, Death, or necessary absence of the M ASTER , the Senior W ARDEN shall act as M ASTER P RO T EM POR E , if no Brother is present who has been M ASTER of that L ODGE bef ore, f or in that Case the A BSE NT M ASTER ’ S Authority reverts to the last M ASTER then present; though he cannot act until the said S ENIOR W ARDEN has once congregated the L ODGE , or in his Absence the J UNIOR W ARDEN . 45 43 About all that is known of the origin of these Regula tions is stated in their title. They were printed in A NDERSON ’ S “Constitutions.” 1723. Originally styled “ General Regulations ,” they ar e usually cited as “the Old Regulations, ” for the r eason that A NDERSON in his second (1738) edition, after making var ious changes to them , pr inted in par allel colum ns with them what he denom inated, “ The N EW R EGULATIONS , or the Alterations, Improvem ents, and E xplications of the O LD , m ade by sever al Grand Lodges , since the f irst Edition .” The more im por tant of these New Regulations – som e of them m erely com ments by A NDERSON – ar e pr inted as foot- notes in the following pages, and m arked “ New Reg ., 1738.” See note on Regulation XXXIX. 44 “T HAT is, only when the G.

It was agr eed, (But was neglected to be r ecor ded. ) that if a Master of a par ticular Lodge is deposed or dem its, the Senior Wa rden shall forthwith fill the Master’s Chair till the next Tim e of chusing; and ever since, in the Master’s absence, he fills th e Chair, even tho’ a former Master be present.” – New Reg ., 1738."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 2   III. The M ASTER of each particular L ODGE , or one of the W ARDENS , or some other Brother by his Order, shall keep a Book containing their B Y -L AWS , the Names of their Members, with List of all the L ODGES in Town, and the usual Times and Places of their forming, 46 and all their Transactions that are proper to be written. IV. No L ODGE shall make more than FIVE N EW B RETHREN at one time, nor any Man under the Age of T WENTY -F IVE , who must be also his own Master ; unless by a Dispensation from the G RAND M ASTER or his D EPUTY . 47 V. No Man can be made or admitted a Member of a particular Lodge, without previous notice O NE M ONTH B EFORE given to the said L ODGE , in order to make due Enquiry into the Reputation and Capacity of the C ANDIDATE ; unless by the Dispensation aforesaid. 48 VI. But no Man can be enter’d a Brother in any particular Lodge, or admitted to be a Member thereof, without the U NANIMOUS C ONSENT OF A LL THE M EMBERS OF T HAT L ODGE then present when the C ANDIDATE is propose’d, and their Consent is formally ask’d by the M ASTER ; 49 and they are to signify their C ONSENT or D ISSENT in their own prudent way, either virtually or in form, but with Unanimity; Nor is this inherent Privilege subject to a Dispensation; because the M EMBERS of a particular L ODGE are the best Judges of it; and if a frac tious Member should be impos’d on them, it might spoil their Harmony, or hinder their Freedom; or even break and disperse the L ODGE , which ought to be avoided by all good and true Brethren.

But this Regulation is neglected for several Reasons, and now obsolete.” – New Reg . 1738. L AWRENCE D ERMOTT , in a note on a “Short Charge” appended to the Old Charges in th e Masonic Code of the “Ancient s,” bases the objection to dual membership on the ground that a Mason is “not to neglect his own necessary Avocations for the sake of Masonry,” saying: “Here you are to understand that a Mason ought not to belong to a number of lodges at one time, nor run from lodge to lodge, or otherwise, after Masons or Masonry, whereby his business or family may be neglect ed; but yet every Mason is subject to all the bye-laws of his lodge, which he is strictly and constantly to obey; - for the attendance and dues of one lodge, can ne ver prejudice neither him nor his family. – Ahiman Rezon , 1764, p. 36. 48 But if they know the Candidate, they don’t require a Dispensation.” – New. Reg ., 1738. 49 “On 19 Feb . 1724. No Visitor , however skill’d in Masonry, shall be admitted into a Lodge . unless he is personally known or well vouched and recommended by one of that Lodge present. “But it was found inconvenient to insist upon Unanimity in several Cases: And therefore the Grand Masters have allow’d the Lodges to admit a member, if not above 3 Ballots are against him; though some Lodges desire no such Allowance .” – New Reg., 1738. – The earliest record or a Grand Master’s “allowing” what th e law should not be allowed. See the remainder of Regulation VI. 50 After a reference to the Grand Lodge’s “General Charity,” first proposed in 1724, A NDERSON adds: “Only particular Lodges are not limited, but may take their own Method for Charity .” – New Reg., 1739. 51 In other words, they must not, without authority, set up a new Lodge. That this Regulation is not aimed at individual withdraw als, but at the formation of unauthorized Lodges by “sets or numbers of brethren,” sufficiently appear s in the remainder of the Regulation, as well as the following notes thereon:"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 3        If any Set or Number of Masons sh all take upon themselves to form a L ODGE without the G RAND -M ASTER ’ S Warrant, the R EGULAR L ODGES are not to countenance them, nor own them as F AIR B RETHREN and duly form’d, nor approve of their Acts and Deeds; but must treat them as R EBELS , until they humble themselves, as the G RAND M ASTER shall in his Prudence direct, and until he approve of them by his W ARRANT , which must be signify’d to the O THER L ODGES , as the Custom is when a N EW L ODGE is to be register’d in the L IST OF L ODGES .

The term “admitted Ma sters” had reference, in operative Masonry, to the occasion when the apprentice, h aving served seven years in learning his trade, and given proof of his proficie ncy, as released from his indenture, and recognized as a mast er of his trade. Much has been written concerning the inferences to be drawn from this Re gulation and the three expre ssions quoted below, upon the su bject of Masonic “degrees” in 1723, 1725 and 1738.

The G RAND -M ASTER , or his D EPUTY , shall always command the T REASURER and S ECRETARY , with their C LERKS and B OOKS , in order to see how Matters go on, and to know what is expedient to be done up any emergent Occasion. Another Brother (who must be a F ELLOW -C RAFT 57 ) should be appointed to look after the Door of the G RAND -L ODGE ; but shall be no Member of it. But these Offices may be farther explain’d by a N EW R EGULATION , when the Necessity and Expediency of them may more appear than at present to the F RATERNITY . XIV. If at any Grand-Lodge, stated or occasional, quarterly or annual, the G RAND - M ASTER and his D EPUTY should be both absent, then the present M ASTER of a L ODGE , that has been the longest a Free-Mason, shall take the Ch air, and preside as Grand Master Pro Tempore; 58 and shall be vested with all his Power and Honour for the time; provided there is no Brother present that has been Grand-Master form erly, or Deputy Grand-Master; for the last Grand-Master present, or else the last Deputy Present, should always of right take place in the Absence of the present Grand-Master and his Deputy. XV. In the G RAND -L ODGE none can act as W ARDENS but the G RAND -W ARDENS themselves, if present; and if absent, the G RAND -M ASTER , or the Person who presides in his Place, shall order P RIVATE W ARDENS to act as G RAND -W ARDENS P RO T EMPORE , 59 whose Places are to be 56 On 19 Feb . 1724, The Officers of particular Lodges shall bring to the G. Lodge the Lists of all the Members of their respective Lodges to be in the G. Lodge Book .” – New Reg ., 1738. 57 Among the changes which A NDERSON quietly made in the text of the Old Regulations, in the 1738 edition, was the substitution of “ Master- Mason ” for “ Fellow-Craft ” in the accounts of Clerks and Tyler. The reason was that in earlier times “Master” always meant Master of a Lodge, except when a Fellow was referred to as mast er of his trade; but before 1738 our present nomenclature had become established. 58 “In the first Edition, the Right of the G . W ARDENS was omitted in this Regulation ; and it has been since found that the Old Lodges never put into the Chai r the Master of a particular Lodge , bur when there was no Grand Warden in company, present nor former , and that in such a Case a Grand Officer always took place of any Master of a Lodge that has not been a G. Officer . “Therefore in Case of the Absence of all G. Masters and Deputies ; the present Sen. G. W ARDEN fills the Chair; and in his Absence the present Jun. G. W ARDEN , and in his Absence the oldest former G. W ARDEN in Company; and if no Former G. Officer be found, then the oldest Free-Mason who is now the Master of a Lodge . “But to avoid Dispute, the G. Master usually gives a particular Commission under his Hand and Seal of Office, countersigned by the Secretary , to the Senior G. Warden , or in his Absence, to the Junior , to act as D. G. Master when the Deputy is not in Town.” – New Reg., 1738. 59 “Soon after the first Edition of the Book of Constitutions , the G RAND L ODGE finding it was always the ancient Usage that oldest former G. W ARDENS supplied the Places of those of the Year when absent, the G.

XVI. The G RAND -W ARDENS , or any others are first to advise with the D EPUTY about the Affairs of the L ODGE or of the Brethren, and not to apply to the G RAND -M ASTER without the Knowledge of the D EPUTY , unless he refuses his Concurrence in any certain necessary Affair; in which Case, or in case of any Difference between the D EPUTY and the G RAND -W ARDENS , or other Brethren, both Parties are to go by Concert to the G RAND M ASTER , who can easily decide the controversy and make up the difference by virtue of his great Authority. The G RAND -M ASTER should receive no Intimation of Business concerning M ASONRY , but from his D EPUTY first, except in such certain Cases as his Worship can well judge of; for if the Application to the G RAND M ASTER be irregular, he can easily order the G RAND -W ARDENS , or any other Brethren thus applying, to wait upon his D EPUTY , who is to prepare the Business speedily, and to lay it orderly before his W ORSHIP . XVII. No G RAND -M ASTER , D EPUTY Grand-Master, G RAND -W ARDENS , T REASURER , S ECRETARY , or whoever acts for them, or in their stead P RO T EMPORE , can at the same time be the M ASTER or W ARDEN of a particular L ODGE , but as soon as any of them has honourably discharg’d his G RAND O FFICE , he returns to that Post or Station in his particular L ODGE , from which he was call’d to officiate above. XVIII. If the D EPUTY G RAND -M ASTER be sick, or necessarily absent, the G RAND -M ASTER may chuse any F ELLOW -C RAFT he pleases to be his DEPUTY P RO T EMPORE : 60 But he that is chosen D EPUTY at the G RAND -L ODGE , and the G RAND -W ARDENS too, cannot be discharg’d without the Cause fairly appear to the M AJORITY of the G RAND -L ODGE ; and the G RAND - M ASTER , if he is uneasy, may call a G RAND -L ODGE on purpose to lay the Cause before them, and to have their Advice and C oncurrence; In which case the M AJORITY of the G RAND -L ODGE , if they cannot reconcile the M ASTER and his D EPUTY or his W ARDENS , are to concur in allowing the M ASTER to discharge his said D EPUTY or his said W ARDENS , and to chuse another D EPUTY immediately; and the said G RAND -L ODGE shall chuse other W ARDENS in that case, that Harmony and Peace may be preserv’d. XIX. If the G RAND -M ASTER should abuse his Power, and render himself un-worthy of the Obedience and Subjection of the L ODGES , he shall be treated in a way and manner to be agreed upon in a N EW R EGULATION ; because hitherto the ancient F RATERNITY have had no occasion for it, their former G RAND -M ASTERS having all behaved themselves worthy of that honourable Office. XX. The G RAND -M ASTER , with his D EPUTY and W ARDENS , shall (at least once) go round and visit all the L ODGES about Town during his M ASTERSHIP . XXI. If the Gr AND -M ASTER should die during his M ASTERSHIP , or by Sickness, or by being beyond Sea, 61 or any other way should be render’d un capable of discharging his Office, the D EPUTY , or in his Absence, the S ENIOR G RAND -W ARDEN , or in his Absence the J UNIOR , or in his Absence any three Present M ASTERS of L ODGES , shall join to congregate the G RAND -L ODGE immediately, to advise together upon that Emergenc y, and to send two of their Number to invite the L AST G RAND -M ASTER to resume his Office, which now in course reverts to him; or if he can refuse, then the NEXT LAST , and so backward; But if no former G RAND -M ASTER can be Wardens pro tempore; which they have always done in the Absence of the G. Wardens for the Year, except when they have waiv ed their Privileges for that time, to honour some Brother whom they thought more fit for the present Service. “But if no former Grand Wardens are in Company, the G RAND M ASTER , or He that presides , calls forth whom he pleases to act as Grand Warden pro tempore.” – New Reg ., 1738. 60 “The Senior G. W ARDEN how ever supplies the D EPUTY ’ S Place, the Junior acts as the S ENIOR , the oldest former G.

Then the M ASTER and W ARDENS , and all the Brethren, may converse promiscously, or as they please to sort together, until the Dinner coming in, when every Brother takes his Seat at Table. 65 As early as 1735 this Grand Lodge, taking a step which has been ge nerally regarded as a very wide departure from ancient usage s, erected certain favored individuals into a body called the “S tewards Lodge.” which, in consideration of its furnishing the annual feast as its own expense, was accorded extraordinary privileges. The beast was then put in charge of the “Stewards Lodge,” and much of Regulations XXII-XXVII became o bsolete. 66 “In ancient Times the Master , Wardens , and Fellows on St. John’s Day met either in a Monastery , or on the Top of the highest Hill near them, by Peep of Day; And having there chosen their New G. Officers , they descended walking in due Form to the Place of the Feast , either a Monastery , or the House of an Eminent Mason , or some large House of Entertainment as they thought best tyled. “But of late they go in Coaches . • • • .” – New Reg ., 1738. Possibly it is well to caution the young reader that B RO . A NDERSON is supposed to have possessed many of the qualities of a successful romancer. 67 “This old Regulation was found inconvenient; Therefore at the Assembly on 27 Dec . 1720, it was agreed that the New G. Master should by the Present be propos’d to the G. Lodge at their Communication, some time before the Day of the Annual Feast ; and that if he was approv’d then, or no Objection made, he was to be forthwith saluted G.

Some time after Dinner, the G RAND -L ODGE is form’d, not in Retirement, but in the Presence of all the Brethren, who yet are not Members of it, and must not therefore speak until they are desir’d and allow’d. 68 XXXII. If the G RAND M ASTER of last Year has consented with the M ASTERS and W ARDENS in private, before Dinner, to continue for the Year ensuing; then O NE of the G RAND -L ODGE , deputed for that purpose, shall represent to ALL THE B RETHREN HIS W ORSHIP ’ S G OOD G OVERNMENT , &c.

It retained its operative character to the last, although speculative Masons were received as visit ors. Second, it did not unite with either of the three English Grand L odges, or with its nearer ne ighbor, the Grand Lodge of Sc otland, but was still independ ent at the date when its minute book ends, - 1757.

APPENDIX I THE ANCIENT LANDMARKS The rituals and literature of Freemasonry contain many allusions to “THE ANCIENT LANDMARKS’, the immemorial usages and cu stoms, the foundation stones upon which modern Freemasonry has been erected. A noted American Masonic scholar, Dr. Albert G. Mackey, formulated a list of twenty-five landmarks. Opinion as to the falidity of his list is not unanimous. Some Grand Lodges adopted his twenty-five, some as many as fifty, others fewer in number. Bro. Roscoe Pound, a Past Deputy Gra nd Master of Massachusetts, and for many years Dean of the School of Law at Harvard, promulgated a list of seven. The Grand Lodge of Washington never officia lly adopted a list of Ancient Landmarks. The following lists are included here as educational material only, in order that the origins and traditions, the usages and customs, the heritage of our Fraternity may be preserved. THE ANCIENT LANDMARKS as formulated by Dr. Albert G. Mackey: 1. The modes or recognition. 2. The division of symbolic Masonry into three degrees. 3. The legend of the Third Degree. 4. The government of the Fraternity by a Grand Master elected from the body of the Craft 5. The prerogative of the Grand Master to preside over any assembly of the Craft. 6. The prerogative of the Grand Master to gran t dispensation for conferring degrees irregular times. 7. The prerogative of the Grand Master to grant disp ensations for the opening and holding of Lodges. 8. The prerogative of the Grand Master to make Masons at sight. (SEE NOTE BELOW). 9. The necessity for Masons to congregate in Lodges. 10. The government of every Lodge by a Master and two Wardens. 11. The necessity of every Lodge when congregated being duly tyled. 12. The right of every Mason to be represented in all general meetings of the Craft and to instruct his representatives. 13. The right of every Mason to appeal from th e decision of his Brethren, in Lodge convened, to the Grand Lodge or General Assembly of Masons. 16. No Lodge can interfere in the business of another Lodge. 17. very Freemason is amenable to the Laws and Regulations of the Masonic Jurisdiction which he resides. 19. Every Mason must believe in the existence of God as the Grand Architect of the Universe. 21. The “Book of the Law” is an indispensable part of the furniture of every Masonic Lodge. 22. That all men in the sight of God are equal and meet in the Lodge on one common level."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 2 NOTE: 8. MAKING MASONS AT SIGHT.

Hanson (87, 281) The accompanying chart is a graphic outline of the genealogy of the Grand Lodge of Washington, extending back to five foreign Grand Jurisdictions-the Grand Lodge of England (Moderns), the Grand Lodge of Ireland, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, Mother Kilwinning Grand Lodge and the Grand Lodge of England According to old Institutions, also known as the Ancients, the Schismatics, the Atholls and as the Ancient York Masons. The modern Grand Lodge system dates from the organization of the Grand Lodge of England (Moderns), in 1717. The earlier period had been one of Operative Masonry, later admitting Speculative Masons. By 1717 there existed, under the Old Customs, Lodges of Operative Masons, of both Operative and Speculative Masons and of purely Speculative Masons. The new system spread rapidly, but the old Customs continued for a long time, especially in the British Colonies. Instances of the Old Customs appear in the genealogy of the Grand Lodge of Washington. The development of American Masonic jurisprudence has been a process of slow growth. The history of the formation of the American Lodges and Grand Lodges in our chain of Masonic genealogy must be read in the light of the customs and jurisprudence of the time. The Grand Lodge of Washington was organized at Olympia, December 8,1858, by representatives of four Lodges holding charters from the Grand Lodge of Oregon: Olympia Lodge, No. 5 (now No. 1), at Olympia, chartered June 14, 1853; Steilacoom Lodge, No. 8 (now No. 2), at Steilacoom, chartered June 13, 1854; Grand Mound Lodge, No. 21 (later No. 3), at Grand Mound, chartered July 13, 1858 (charter surrendered September 19, 1868), and Washington Lodge No. 22 (now No. 4), at Vancouver, chartered July 13, 1858. The Grand Lodge of Oregon was organized at Oregon City, August 16, 1851, by representatives of three Lodges, one chartered by the Grand Lodge of Missouri and two by the Grand Lodge of California. The Grand Lodge of California was organized at Sacramento, April 19, 1850, by representatives of three Lodges chartered by the Grand Lodges of Missouri, District of Columbia and Connecticut; the representatives of two more Lodges holding Dispensations from the Grand Lodge of New Jersey and the Grand Lodge of Louisiana (A.Y.M.) being seated as Masons in the Convention, holding offices and participating in the formation of the Grand Lodge. The genealogy of the Grand Lodge of Washington extends through the Grand Lodges of Oregon, California, Missouri, Tennessee, North Carolina (State), North Carolina (Provincial), Connecticut, Massachusetts (English Constitution), Massachusetts (Scottish Constitution), New York (English Constitution), New Jersey, District of Columbia, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Louisiana (A.Y.M.), Mississippi and Kentucky and to the five foreign Grand Lodges above mentioned. [Rev. 2003] "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" 2 Our earliest Masonic connections with these foreign Grand Lodges extend to: The Grand Lodge of England (Moderns), in the Deputation, dated April 13, 1733, appointing Henry Price, of Boston, as Provincial Grand Master of New England; The Grand Lodge of Scotland, in the Warrant, dated December 1, 1755, for Kilwinning Crosse Lodge, at Port Royal, Virginia; The Grand Lodge of England (Ancients), in the Warrant, dated June 7, 1758, for Lodge No. 69, at Philadelphia; The Grand Lodge of Ireland, in the Warrant, dated May 3, 1759, for Lodge No. 322, in the 29th Regt., which, at the time of the organization of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts (Scottish Constitution), was stationed at Boston and participated in the formation of that Grand Lodge; and Mother Kilwinning Grand Lodge, in the Warrant, dated about 1767, for Tappahannock Lodge, at Tappahannock, Virginia. The genealogy of the Grand Lodge of Washington covers a period of nearly three hundred and fifty years, extending back to the formation of the modern Grand Lodge system, in 1717, and on through the Old Customs to the Lodge at Kilwinning, whose records date from before 1598, the oldest known records of Operative Masonry. Within this span of time the known history of Masonry is found. Back of it lie the Legends of the Craft. Genealogy of the Washington Grand Lodge Seal. 1. At its first Communication, on December 8, 1858, the Grand Lodge authorized the appointment of a committee “to procure a suitable s eal for use of the Grand Lodge and at as early a day as practicable” (Proceed. Const. Conv. 15). The first facsimile of the Grand Lodge seal appears in the certificate of the Grand Lodge S ecretary to the transcript of the Grand Lodge Proceedings of its second Annual Communicati on (1859, I, 2) following appropriation of $50.00 for its purchase (1859, I, 58). The Grand Secretary reported at the third Annual Communication an expenditure for the Seal of $46.00 and $4.75 for expressage (1860, I, 116). It was not until the adoption of the Code of 1913 (Sec. 41) that the de sign of the Seal as or iginally shown, 1859, I, 2, except elimination of the abbreviation “Ter y.” upon Washington becoming a state (1890, VIII, 170) was formally adopted by Grand Lodge. How the motto “Exitus acta probat” came to be selected as the motto of Grand Lodge is not di sclosed by any of the Proceedings. Possibly it was taken from the maxim “exitus acta probat; finis, non pugna, coronat” – “The result justifies the acts; the termination, not the trial, crowns the victory.” (Adams Gloss.) 2. On the suggestion of R ∴ W ∴ Brother Baldrey, the Code Commission made research for the source of the motto on our Grand Lodge Seal; correspondence between the Code Commission and Sol Bloom, Associate Director, and Prof. Albert Bushnell Hart, Historian of the United States Commission for the Celebration of the 200 th Anniversary of the Birth of George Washington, disclosed the fact that the motto was used by George Washington and his ancestors in England in connection with the Coat of Arms and Crest confirmed to Lawrence Washington of Sulgrave and his descendants by the Garter King of Arms in 1593.

That Grand Master in his Annual Address reported that the Worshipful Master of a Lodge had showed marked discourtesy toward the Grand Lodge; referred to Committee on Grievances and Appeals, which recommended three month’s suspension which was by Grand Lodge amended to “censure.” Committee Report as amended, adopted. 1896, pg 23, 30, 72, 74. 8 .

Grand Master ordered a Lodge to take off their stationery all advertisements about certain so-called higher orders. Decision Grand Master approved. 1931, pg 33, 61. 6. Membership in So-Called Clandestine Scottish Rite. A Mason does not lose his membership in the Order by reason of joining a so-called clandestine Scottish Rite. Officially, Masonry knows nothing beyond the three Degrees, and membership therein is no more affected by such joining than by joining a church or a club, unless there is in connection with the joining some Masonic offense which renders him subject to discipline at the hands of the Lodge. Ruling Grand Master approved. 1932, pg 373, 474. 7. Dual Membership in Unrecognized Lodge. Merely petitioning for dual membership in a Lodge not recognized by the Grand Lodge of Washington does not of itself work a forfeiture of membership in Washington Lodge.

Chapter 28 28.04 Trial to Proceed if Accused Voluntarily Absent. 1. Refusal to Appear, Procedure. When an appeal from a judgment of expulsion by an accused had been sustained on jurisdictional grounds and the Grand Master had remanded the case to Lodge for trial, the accused refused to appear and claimed that when Grand Lodge repealed Section 234 of the W.M.C. of 1913 by Resolution in 1924, the Lodge could not try him in his absence. This resulted in a second appeal that came before the Committee on Grievances and Appeals, which held that, inasmuch as the accused’s request for a trial by a properly constituted tribunal had been granted by the Grand Lodge the preceding year, it was his duty to appear and meet the charge on remanding of the case, and that failure of the accused to appear would not preclude the Lodge tribunal from proceeding and rendering judgment. Decision Grand Master and Committee Report adopted. 1926, pg 278, 374. 28.06 Testimony Reduced to Writing. 1. Written Evidence in Civil Action Inadmissible.

When the verdict of Lodge is based upon plea of guilty and the prime object of an appeal is to increase the degree of punishment decided upon by the Lodge, such decision should be less lightly disturbed than almost any other. The Lodge having given the case fair and mature consideration, there is no reason why Grand Lodge should interfere with the decision rendered. Report of Committee on Grievances and Appeals adopted. 1902, pg 48-49. 5. Effect of Petition for Restoration Upon Appeal. Filing of petition for restoration waives the right of appeal to Grand Lodge, but if the petition is withdrawn prior to the date set for consideration, the right of appeal is restored, provided the appeal is made in a timely manner.

Opinion of Grand Master approved. 1899, pg 340, 368."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" 70 2. Certificate to Entered Apprentice. An E.A. whose expulsion in 1911 was Un- appealed petitioned for restoration in 1926 and the Grand Master held as follows. When an E.A. has been expelled and such expulsion is Un-appealed from, the Lodge may restore such E.A. “to the rights of Masonry without Lodge membership” by a two-thirds vote, whereupon the Brother would be entitled to a certificate of that fact, as provided for in W.M.C.

Rulings and Decisions Sec. 33.04 above, stands as an E.A. expelled from the rights and Masonry and the action of the Lodge in restoring him is null and void.

An expelled E.A. whose case was not appealed to Grand Lodge may be restored to rights of Masonry without Lodge membership by petition to the Lodge which expelled him, as provided for in W.M.C.

Decision Grand Master to contrary disapproved. 1932, pg 374, 474. 6. Restoration to Rights of Masonry. Where a member of a Lodge has been expelled for misrepresentation in his petition for Degrees as to his residential qualifications, from which sentence of expulsion no appeal has been taken, the Lodge could receive and act upon his petition for restoration to the rights of Masonr y, the Grand Lodge of California consenting, and the Lodge in the town of which such member had at all times been a resident, waiving jurisdiction for that purpose. Decision Grand Master approved. 1933, pg 20, 93. 7. Discussion Permitted. A petition for restoration after expulsion can be discussed at discretion of Worshipful Master.
