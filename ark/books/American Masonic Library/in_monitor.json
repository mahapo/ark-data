Our most eminent savants have devoted time, effort and verbiage to the commendable task of expressing in a few, simple words that which is Masonry. Some have almost succeeded. But always, that vital spark which is the very touchstone of our Craft has eluded them. There is inherent in this ancient and honorable institution an intangible, indefinable element which apparently lies beyond the power of words. Without it, no definition of Masonry can be con - sidered complete. We may find it impossible to define this illusive component in words, but the understanding Mason"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR 8 9 HiSTORY OF FREEMASONRY knows it is there just as certainly as he knows there is a G.A.O.T.U. He is therefore satisfied to accept at face value one or more of those definitions which, although admittedly incomplete, most closely approach the ideal. Perhaps therein lies one explanation of the power which Masonry exerts upon the hearts of its votaries, who are thus bound together by that “mystic tie” which never the tongue of man shall speak nor the pen of man shall write. Officially, Masonry is defined as consisting of a course of moral instruction, illustrated by types, emblems and allegorical figures. The old English Constitutions state it in this manner, “a system of morality veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.” . . - Webster says an allegory “repre - sents by suggestive resemblance”; and a symbol is “a visible sign or representation of an idea.” Right Worshipful Brother Charles C. Hunt, Grand Secretary Emeritus of the Grand Lodge of Iowa, A.F. & A.M., proposes the following de - finition, after an extensive analysis of opinions of other eminent Masonic scholars, “Freemasonry is an organized society of men symbolically apply - ing the principles of operative masonry and archi - tecture to the science and art of character build - ing.” This especially distinguishes our Fraternity from all other organizations which teach a system of morality. Combine the above definitions, if you will. Add to them that cosmic spark which makes of man a Temple of God; and you will be as close as mortal may ever come to defining our gentle Craft with words. “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God him shall God de - stroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.”—I Corinthians 3:16-17. HISTORICAL SKETCH OF FREEMASONRY Origins “How old is Freemasonry? When and where were its beginnings?” . . . These apparently sim - pIe questions must occur to every initiate. Have we an equally simple and direct reply? The answer, is “NO I”, as every Masonic student soon learns. Freemasonry was not created at a given moment, or even in a single day, month, or year. It is a growth whose roots extend in many directions; a growth which has been nourished by the aspira - tions and the achievements of the human race from the very dawn of history. The distant origins, the actual beginnings of our Craft are veiled in the vague mists of antiquity; and, to this day, they remain one of the great enigmas of our ancient and honorable Fraternity. The voluminous literature of FreemasonTy is replete with historical treatises by a host of eminent brethren, each seeking an equitable an - swer to the questions above. In numerable theories have been advanced. Unfortunately some are highly imaginative, misleading, even fantastic. Others, however, are rational, credible; the fruits of diligent, scholarly research, supported by re - liable documentary evidence, scientific data, and logical deduction. No reasonable field of inquiry has escaped a searching study. Yet, the problem remains but partially solved. Occasionally new and valuable facts have ap - peared to support a favored hypothesis; and it momentarily seemed that the end of the trail was"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"‘TI1TII 7JE777’” 10 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR near. To these findings the Fraternity responded with eager expectancy, “At last the real answer has been found!” But always, inevitably, an es - sential link in the chain of proof was weak or entirely missing. Thus, the stamp of uncertainty remains indelibly impressed upon the earliest chapters in the story of Masonry’s origin. Modern critical knowledge of Freemasonry is prepared to show, however, that its roots run deep, very deep, into the sub-soil of civilization. “It is apparent from the most casual study of the records of primitive peoples that their reli - gions, philosophies, social systems, folk thought and folk ways had much in common, however widely they may have been separated from one another by time or clime. Comparisons between these and certain superficial phenomena of Free - masonry disclose resemblances which cannot but arrest the attention of reflective minds. Even if there had been no pretentious claims of antiquity for the Craft, intuition would at once bridge the chasms of centuries and connect it with more than one of the ancient societies that have flourished in the past, and which, in all essentials save that of chronological continuity, form with it a part of the common human inheritance ... “The modern student of Freemasonry, fortu - nately, is not compelled to rely upon legendary lore on the one hand, or, on the other, the docu - mentary researches of skeptics. The Fraternity’s claim to ancient beginnings rests upon a surer foundation than either can supply. Its ascertain - able age is great, but its probable age is greater. In substantially its present form, as a speculative society, it has existed for more than two cen - turies. In its earlier operative form it existed through many other centuries—at least through HISTORY OF FREEMASONRY ii a great part of that long period when Gothic builders were dotting Europe with God’s cathe - drals. It is significant that at the earliest moment to which that form can be traced, it already had venerable legends boasting of beginnings far more remote.”’ It is not within the scope of this short essay to develop the substantial evidence which supports Freemasonry’s kinship with such ancient cults and societies as the Ancient Mysteries of Greece, the Roman Colleges of Artificers (Roman Col - legia) or the Comacine Masters, which are among the more prominent of many others. The student will find this expertly and fascinatingly discussed in many of the excellent books to be found in all Masonic libraries; and he will be amply rewarded for having read them. H. L. Haywood and James E. Craig, 2 promi - nent modern authors, admirably summarize the status of Masonry’s claim to ancient beginnings in the closing paragraphs of their chapter on “Origins and Intimations.” Having established numerous evidences of the relationships men - tioned above, they conclude, “Such evidences of Masonry’s share in the common stock of the world’s cult phenomena, if rIghtly understood, make plain many things which have been obscure. It is true they do not prove the continuous existence of the Fraternity from before the Flood to the institution of the first Grand Lodge. They do not establish connection between it and any particular band, society, group or cult in existence before the Dark Ages. But they do reveal the essential kinship of Freemasonry with the reli - gious and philosophical societies of previous ages; 1 A History of Freemasonry, by Hayvvood and Craig. 2 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"12 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR nor is there today any other similar society which can deny ~dasonry’s prescriptive right to claim these relics as its own or dispute with it the palm for honorable age. “Modern Freemasonry is in the truest sense a reservoir into which the cult lore and social experiences of countless eons of homan experience have poured their treasures. Into this mighty lake, streams have trickled from the remotest mountain tops; it is fed from innumerable founts. It signi - fies little how the life-giving waters have found their way into its bosom, by what channels they have come, across what continents they have flowed. “Fortunately for the peace of mind of the modern initiate there are no arbitrary tests of faith in these matters, so there can be no trials for heresy or danger of sorcerer burning. There are certain ancient doctrines known as the Land - marks which every duly obligated Freemason is bound to respect; there are prescriptions of Masonic conduct which he is bound to obey. But if he chooses to believe that the Fraternity de - scended by some mysterious process from the planet Neptune he is as free to do so as he would be to believe that Neptune itself is the ghost of a previous planetary incarnation of the world. Conversely, if he prefers to regard some of the ancient legends as pure allegories, there is none with authority to deny him that privilege. In either case, the great symbolical teachings of the Craft will remain unaffected.” Perhaps the best prediction we may essay here concerning Masonry’s future is “that since here - tofore it has never failed to respond to the con - temporaneous requirements of humanity there is OPERATIVE AND SPECULATIVE MASONRY 18 no reason to suppose it ever will fail.” 3 Its re - corded history of the past three centuries may serve effectively as a roadguide to our destiny, “whither we are traveling”; but, as yet, no man can say with certainty “from whence we came.” No doubt each intelligent effort to draw aside the mist which veils our infancy brings us closer and closer to reality. Man—with patient persist. ence and with science as tool and servant—has triumphed over many perplexing problems of our universe. So may the final clue to Masonry’s origin one day yield to vigilant, persevering effort. Perhaps some neglected, moldy record, yellowed and fragile from being too long denied the light, may yet emerge from dank cellar or webby garret to clarify Freemasonry’s nativity. Archeologists of this day, or as yet unborn, may conceivably unearth some ancient crypt wherein the story of our beginnings will be revealed by curious inscrip - tions or hieroglyphics. Time, patience, yesearch, unceasing effort, these are the keys to which the door of Masonry’s re - mote past will finally yield. In the interim, our actual recorded history, established by irrefutable documentary evidence, is an ancient and honorable story that all men may read. It should be a soarce of humble yet gratifying pride to every Craftsman. Read it! Remember it! Measure up to it! . . . It demands much, but it offers more.

The physical body is the form and organiza - tion of the Fraternity; the spiritual body is its philosophy, which is” (according to one of our best definitions) “a course of ancient hieroglyph - ical moral instruction, and is taught agreeable to ancient usage, by types, emblems, and allegorical figures. It matters little, therefore, insofar as the eternal truths of Freemasonry are concerned, just where and how the institution had its origins. If we keep this fact in mind, and learn the moral, ethical, and spiritual lessons which are brought out in the evolution of the Craft, as we actually know it from medieval periods to the present day, our minds can be at peace in the midst of the confu - sion which greets us from time to time in our studies.” 4 The oldest existing written record of our Craft is a document known as the Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem, written by an unknown author about 1390. Although written nearly six centuries ago, it shows Freemasonry to have been very old, even at that remote date. Prior to the beginning of the 18th century, our brethren were engaged in the actual, manual, operative work of construction. Hence we desig - nate them as Operative Masons. They were a remarkable class of men; highly skilled artists, designers, builders of religious and public edifices which have since been the admiration of every age. It has been said that they were the true torch-bearers of civilization during the Middle Ages. It was customary for these Craftsmen, or Opera - tive Workmen engaged in the art and science of 4 Short Readings in Masonic History, by J. Hugo Tatsch. F OPERATIVE AND SPECULATIVE MASONRY 15 building, to organize themselves into a band or society called a Lodge. Such organizations were also known as Craft Guilds, or Fellowships of Operative Masons. They were governed by a Master and two Wardens, with the assistance of officers equivalent to a Secretary and Treasurer. The aims and purposes of the Lodge were to improve its members in the particular work in which they were engaged; to inculcate true friend - ship and mutual aid; to maintain a charity fund from which relief to its members, their widows and orphans, could be dispensed when needed; and to render due homage to the Grand Architect of the Universe, who was recognized as the Supreme i’d aster of the draft throughout the world. These early Lodges, composed of operative work - men, conducted regular meetings; received and accepted new members by mystic rites, ceremonies, and initiation; arranged and classified the mem - bers into groups and laid the broad and general foundation upon which a Masonic Lodge is erected today. They bound their members by solemn vows, and severe penalties were inflicted for violations. (See “IViodern Penalties,” page 134). In such manner the Fraternity, in its Operative Period, developed and flourished, particularly dur - ing the cathedral-building era in Continental Europe. Of necessity, it worked hand- in hand with the Church and was thus, in a sense, its servant. Then there developed, gradually, a period of transition throughout the world. As civilization advanced, knowledge became increasingly acces - sible to more and more of the peoples. This re - sulted in the general publication of many geo - metric and architectural principles which formerly had been possessed only by Freemasons."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"16 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR ORGANIZED MASONRY 17 Early in the 16th century came that stirring period of history known as the Reformation which was, according to Webster, “the important religi - ous movement (reform) . . . which resulted in the formation of the various Protestant (protest-ant) Churches~” The same influences which produced the Reformation had their effects upon Free - masonry. By 1600, according to the Harleian Manuscript (dated about the middle of the 17th century), our order had almost completely “sev - ered its dependence upon the Church and became a refuge for those who wished to be free in thought as well as for Freemasons. It was still Christian — almost aggressively Christian — in its teachings. Not for another hundred years or more, and then only partially, did it rid itself of any sectarian character whatever and become what it is today, a meeting ground for ‘men of every country, sect, and opinion,’ united in a common belief in the Fatherhood of God, the brotherhood of man, and the hope of immortality.” 5 With the Reformation, the Gothic style of architecture began to lose favor. Largely because of this, the Craft Guilds also began a correspond - ing period of decline, for they were unable “to preserve or continue the monopoly so long exer - cised by them. ‘Cowans’ increased in spite of all regulations and efforts to the contrary; the Masters gradually lost their exclusive powers, and toward the end of the 17th century it became evi - dent that the building monopolies and close Cor - porations of the Freemasons’ Lodges had seen their day. It was not the speculatives that caused the decline of the Operative Lodges, but the causes came from within.” 6 i Introduction to Freemasonry, by Carl H. Claudy. 6 Freemasonry from 1600 A.D. to the Grand Lodge Era, by Win. James Hughan. Prior to Ihe 17th century only an Operative Mason could become a member of the Craft. Dur - ing the 17th century, however, a new practice was inaugurated. Men of wealth, culture, and distinc - tion who had no intention of ever becoming build - ers, or Operative Masons, were admitted to mem - bership in the Craft Gailds. They were probably actuated in their desire for membership “mainly from friendly feelings toward the operatives, and to exhibit or manifest an interest in their welfare. The funds were increased by gentlemen joining, and the Lodges were made all the more popular, by the admission of the local squires and others of means in the neighborhood of a Lodge. It was a secret society that was thus joined, and this may have led some to seek admission, from the mystery surrounding the Initiation ceremony. The esoteric character of the Craft has been a source of wonder and curiosity to outsiders for many centuries.” 7 Thus a slowly expiring Craft was effectively stimulated and revived by the gradual admission of “gentlemen,” non-operative members, or Specu - lative Masons as we call them today. The life of the Fraternity was saved; its tenets, precepts, customs, and Landmarks preserved; and, with its membership thus enlarged, the Craft entered upon a corresponding increase in prestige, influence and power. ORGANIZED MASONRY—THE GR6~ND LODGE ERA The year 1717 is the dividing line “between the old Freemasonry and the new; between a Craft which was slowly expiring and one which began to grow with new vitality; between the last 7 Ibid. —— —— — ~ —.—.————.—.—————•‘—r"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"18 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR ORGANIZED MASONRY 19 lingering remains of Operative Masonry and a Craft wholly speculative.” 5 In 1717, four Lodges in London met and feasted at the Goose and Gridiron Ale House on June 24th, St. John the Baptist’s Day. There and then was organized and established the first Grand Lodge of Masons, which was known as the Grand Lodge of England. Anthony Sayer, “gentleman,” was elected first Grand Master. Later, in 1730, the Grand Lodge of Ireland was organized; and in 1736, the Grand Lodge of Scotland. The “Old Charges,” which should be familiar to every Craftsman, is a term descriptive of the manuscript documents upon which the early post-1717 historical treatises of Freemasonry are based. They have been appropriately called the title deeds of Freemasonry and are treated sepa - rately, elsewhere in this Monitor. In 1723, the Rev. James Anderson, active in the Revival of 17 [7, published the Ancient Con - stitutions of Free Masons. It was reprinted in America (1734) by Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia. These important records are men - tioned here because they were the earliest sources of organized l’dasonry’s system of government and ethics. They therefore played an essential role in the destiny of our Fraternity as we know it today. “In our perspective, a Grand Lodge is as much a necessary part of the existing order of things as a State or Federal Government. In 1717 it was a new idea, accompanied by many other new ideas. Some brother or brethren saw that if the ancient Order was not to die, it must be given new life through a new organization. . . - The newly formed Grand Lodge went the whole way. It pro - ~ Introduction to Freemasonry, by Carl H. Claudy. posed to, and did take command of its Lodges. It branched out beyond the jurlsdiction originally proposed ‘within ten miles of London’ and invaded the provinces. It gave enormous powers to the Grand Master. [t prohibited the working of the ‘Master’s Part’ in private Lodges, thus throwing back to the ancient annual assemblies. It divided the Craft into Entered Apprentices and Fellow- crafts. It resolved ‘against all politics as what never yet conduced to the welfare of the lodge nor ever will’.” 9 Finally, the Grand Lodge of England eliminated the ancient charge which read, in part, “to be true to God and Holy Church” and substituted the ancient charge as we know it today. (See page 27, “Concerning God and Religion,” under the heading of “Ancient Charges.”) This “founded modern Speculative Masonry on the rock of non- sectarianism and the brotherhood of all men who believe in a common Father regardless of His name, His church, or the way in which He is worshiped - - . and became a fundamental of the Craft.” 10 FTeemasonry prospered in England from the time the first Grand Lodge was formed in 1717. Later some dissention appeared in the ranks of the Craft and the “Great Schism” took place (1751), with the formation of a second Grand Lodge (England) known as the Atholl or Grand Lodge of Ancients. Lawrence Dermott, a name familiar to all Masonic students, was the moving spirit in this new organization. Paradoxically, the original Grand Lodge of England was there - after known as the Grand Lodge of Moderns. 5 Ibid. 10 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"r 20 INDIANA. MASONIC MONITOR This is an important and highly interesting period in Masonic history, but it involves too much detail to become a part of this brief sketch. The student is therefore again referred to our libra - ries, with renewed assurance that his study will be amply rewarded. Suffice it to say that these two Grand Lodges finally came together, in 1813, and organized the United Grand Lodge of Eng - land, which continues to this day. From the documentary “Articles of Union” (1813) came the following important specifications for Symbolic (“Blue Lodge”) Masonry, “It is declared and pronounced that Ancient Craft Masonry consists of three degrees, and no more, viz., those of Entered Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and the Master Mason including the Holy Royal Arch.” FREEMASONRY COMES TO AMERICA There has been much speculation concerning the presence of Freemasonry in America prior to 1717; but, apparently, no acceptable evidence has been forthcoming to confirm this contention. It is known, however, that Speculative Free - masonry—as represented by individual Masons— did appear in the American Colonies soon after the first Grand Lodge of England was organized. These earliest American Masons were members of English Lodges who had emigrated to the New World and also colonists who had been initiated during return visits to the Mother Country. Daniel Coxe of New Jersey was the first American provincial Grand Master. In 1730, he received a deputation from the Duke of Norfolk, Grand Master of England, appointing him Pro - vincial Grand Master of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, for two years. Historians dis - FREEMASONRY IN AMERICA 21 agree as to whether or not he ever exercised his powers. The first Lodge in America of which there is documentary evidence was in Philadelphia as early as 1730. In 1733, a number of Masons then residing in Boston, petitioned the Grand Lodge of England for authority to establish Masonry in the new world and as a result, Henry Price “father of duly constituted Masonry in America” was appointed Provincial Grand Master of New England and Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging. He formed a Grand Lodge in July, with Andrew Beicher as Deputy Grand Master and Thomas Kennelly and John Quane as Grand Wardens. Grand Master Price then granted the petition of eighteen brethren and constituted them into a Lodge. This body, later consolidatiAg with two others, is now St. John’s Lodge of Boston. Thereafter, about the year 1750, another group of Masons residing in Boston applied to the Grand Lodge of Scotland for a warrant to organize a Masonic Lodge in Boston under the authority of that Grand Lodge. In 1752, a deputation was re - ceived from the Grand Master of Scotland, con - s~ituting the petitioning Masons a regular Lodge, to be known as St. Andrews Lodge No. 82, under and by virtue of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Within a short time, this new Lodge petitioned for authority to establish another Grand Lodge in America. On December 27, 1769, the Festival of St. John the Evangelist was celebrated in due form by the members of St. Andrews Lodge. When festivities were at their height, a commission was read from"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"— ~~i.;;;TTh;;., 12 INDEANA MASONIC MONITOR the Grand Master of Masons of Scotland, ap - pointing Joseph Warren (who later fought so gloriously at Bunker Hill) to be Grand Master of Masons in Boston and within one hundred miles of that city. He was immediately installed ac - cording to ancient usage, and proceeded at once with the appointment and installation of other Grand Lodge officers. The story of Freemasonry during the American Revolution is one to which the Fraternity may refer with everlasting pride. Every American Mason should know it, in detail. It cannot be justly recorded in this brief summary. Members of the two Grand Lodges were dis - organized and scattered in consequence of the war. Subordinate Lodges carried on as best they could under handicaps that were most severe. Military Lodges came into being among both the American and British troops and thus helped to preserve the mystic tie. Despite political rancor and controversy, the passions and bitterness of the times were lost within the asylum of Masonic Lodges, where brother greeted brother on the level and parted on the square. An astonishingly large number of Revolutionary leaders were Masons: George Washington and most of his generals, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere, James Monroe, Anthony Wayne, Ethan Allen, Nathaniel Greene, and many others whose names are almost equally familiar. It is significant, too, that among the leaders of the British forces may be found an almost equally distinguished roll of Masons. When the conflict subsided, members of the two Grand Lodges again assembled to reflect upon the general state of Freemasonry in America. r FREEMASONRY IN AMERICA 28 Since the political relations between this country and England had been severed by the war, it was quickly determined that Masonic allegiance to the Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Scotland had also been severed. Therefore, a new Grand Lodge was organized, descending from and built upon the ruins of the original two; and from it were chartered other Grand Lodges throughout the country. American Masonic Lodges thus became sovereign and in - dependent. Should there be but one Grand Lodge for the entire United States; or, should each State and Territory be independently sovereign? The sound wisdom of the Craft determined upon the latter course. Unhindered by Church or State, the growth of Freemasonry in our country was both rapid and extensive. Grand Lodges were organized in the several states, as expediency determined, and each was sovereign within the limits of its own Grand Jurisdiction. Today, there are forty-nine Grand Lodges in the United States of America, one for each state and one for the District of Columbia. In several of our territories are Grand Lodges; the others have Masonic Lodges which are subordinate to one of the Grand Lodges within our continental boundaries. There are more than 15,000 Masonic Lodges scattered throughout the length and breadth of this nation, with a total membership of almost three million.

It granted charters to various Lodges in Ken~ucl~y, which was then a part of the territory of Virginia. After the Grand Lodge of Kentucky was organized, in 1800, it issued dispensatlons for the formation of Lodges in Indiana as follows: Vincennes, Charlestown, Madison, Corydon, Salem, Lawrenceburg, Vevay, and Rising Sun. The Lodge at Brookville, the only other Lodge in the then Territory, received its charter from Ohio. These were all the Lodges there were in Indiana prior to organization of the Grand Lodge of Indiana in 1818. The first Lodge organized in the Indiana Territory was at Vincennes, which was chartered by the Grand Lodge of Kentucky, August 31, 1809. The Territory was admitted to the Union as a State in 1816, and the brethren deemed it advis - able to take steps looking to the formation of a Grand Lodge. Accordingly, a convention of rep - resentatives of all the above Indiana Lodges met at Corydon on Dec. 3, 1817, for the purpose of taking the preliminary steps for such organization. Agreeably to a resolution from this convention, delegates from the same Lodges met in the town of Madison, Indiana, on Jan. 12, 1818, and there consummated ~he organizatlon of the Grand Lodge of Indiana, electing Alexander Buckner, of Charles- town, as the first Grand Master. The several Lodges there represented then sur - rendered their charters and were granted new charters by “The Grand Lodge of Indiana.” On the same day, a special committee made a report, containing twenty-four sections, embracing the main features of the Constitution as it exists today. The Grand Lodge seal, still in use of course, was also adopted at that time, after being described in complete detail. r Brother McDonald says, “The most important step in the formation of the Grand Lodge was the adoption of ~he ‘Illustrations of Masonry, pub - lished by Brother Thomas Smith Webb,’ for the government of the Grand Lodge and subordinate Lodges.. “12 ]t is of interest to note that much of our monitorial work, contained herein, is taken directly from that publication. “And so it came to pass that the Grand Lodge was legally organized in Indiana on the 12th day of January, 1818; and it is somewhat remarkable, owing to the newness of the country at that time, the lack of educational facilities, and the some - what crude material out of which the organiza - tion necessarily had to be constructed, that the foundation was so substantially and satisfactorily laid. Our ancient Indiana brethren builded better than they knew. No Grand Lodge has existed so long with so little friction, and has so satisfac - torily extricated itself from so many difficult problems, as has the Grand Lodge of Indiana.” 13 Its history is one in which its members may take much pardonable pride, and it stands today with an honorable record of more than one and one-quarter centuries and with more than 500 Lodges. 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"26 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR THE CHARGES of a FREEMASON Extracted from the ANCIENT RECORDS OF LODGES BEYOND SEA To Be Read At The Making Of New Brethren, Or When The Master Shall Order It.

So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanced in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man; and, if convicted of no other crime, though the loyal Brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"_________ -,,~ --- -.-- 28 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or ground of political jealousy to ~he Government for the time being; they can not expel him from the Lodge, and his relation to it remains indefeasible. I]I. OF LODGES A LODGE is a Place where Masons assemble and work; Hence that Assembly, or duly organized Society of Masons, is called a Lodge, and every Brother ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its By-Laws and General Regulations. It is either Particular or General and will be best understood by attending it, and by the reg - ulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annex’d. In Ancient Times no Master or Fellow could be absent from it, especially when warned to appear at it, without incurring a severe Cen - sure, until it appeared to the Master and Wardens, that pure necessity hindered him. The Persons admitted Members of a Lodge must be good and true Men, free-born, and of a mature and discreet age, no Bondmen, no Women, no im - moral or scandalous Men, but of good Report. IV. OF MASTERS, WARDENS, FELLOWS, AND APPRENTICES. All Preferment among Masons is grounded upon real Worth and personal Merit only; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to shame, nor the Royal Craft despis’d; Therefore, no Master or Warden is chosen by Seniority, but for his rderit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and therefore every Brother must attend in his Place, and learn them in a way peculiar to this Fraternity; Candidates may nevertheless know, that no Master should take an Apprentice, unless he has sufficient Employ- r THE ANCIENT CHARGES 29 ment for him and unless he is a perfect Youth, having no Maim or Defect in his Body, that may render him incapable of learning the Art of serving his Master’s Lord, and of being made a Brother, and then a Fellow-Craft in due time, after he has served such a Term of Years as the Custom of ~he Country directs; and that he should be descended of honest parents; that so, when otherwise qualify’d, he may arrive to the Honour of being a Warden, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Master of all the Lodges, according to his Merit. No brother can be a Warden unless he has pas’d the part of a Fellow-Craft; nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand War - den until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor Grand Master until he has been a Fellow-Craft before his Election, who is also to be nobly born, or a Gentleman of the best Fashion, or some eminent Scholar, or some curious Architect, or other Artist, descended of honest Parents, and who is of singularly great Merit in the Opinion of the Lodges. These rulers and Governors, Supreme and Sub - ordinate, of the ancient Lodge, are to be obey’d in their respective Stations by all the Brethren, according to the old Charges and Regulations, with all Humility, Reverence, Love, and Alacrity. V. OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CRAFT IN WORKING All Masons shall work honestly on working Days, that they may live creditably on Holy Days; and the time appointed by the Law of ~he Land, or confirmed by Custom, shall be observed. The most expert of the Fellow-Craftsmen shall be chosen or appointed the Master, or Overseer"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"80 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR of the Lord’s Work; who is to be called Master by those who work under him. The Craftsmen are to avoid all ill language, and call each other by no disobliging Name, but Brother or Fellow; and to behave themselves courteously within and with - out the Lodge. The Master, knowing himself to be able of Cunning, shall undertake the Lord’s Work as reasonably as possible, and truly dispend his Goods as if they were his own; nor give more Wages to any Brother or Apprentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons receiving their Wages justly, shall be faithful to the Lord and honestly finish their Work, whether Task or Journey; nor put the Work to Task that hath been accustomed to Journey. None shall discover Envy at the Prosperity of a Brother, nor supplant him, or put him out of his Work, if he be capable to finish the same; for no Man can finish another’s work so much to the Lord’s profit, unless he be thoroughly ac - quain~ed with the Designs and Draughts of him that began it. When a Fellow-Craftsman is chosen Warden of the Work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fellows, shall carefully oversee the Work in the Master’s absence to the Lord’s profit; and his Brethren shall obey him. All Masons employed shall meekly receive their Wages without Murmuring or Mutiny, and not desert the Master till the work be finish’d. A Younger Brother shall be instructed in work - ing, to prevent spoiling the materials for want of Judgment, and for increasing and continuing of Brotherly Love. r TEE ANCIENT CHARGES All the tools used in worbing shall be approved by the Grand Lodge. No Labourer shall be employed in the proper Work of Masonry; nor shall Free-Masons work with those that are Not Free without an urgent Necessity; nor shall they teach Labourers or Unaccepted Masons, as they should teach a Brother or a Fellow. VI. OF BEHAVIOUR 1. IN THE LODGE WHIL.E CONSTITUTED. You are not to hold private Committees or separate Conversations, without leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinently nor unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any Brother speaking to the Master; nor be - have yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn; nor use any unbecoming Language upon any Pre - tense whatsoever; but to pay due Reverence to your Master, Wardens, and Fellows, and put them to worship. If any Complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the Award and Determina - tion of the Lodge, who are the proper and com - petent Judges of all such Controversies (unless you carry them by Appeal ~o the Grand Lodge), and to whom they ought to be referred, unless a Lord’s work be hindered the meanwhile, in which case a particular reference may be made; but you must never go to Law about what concerneth Masonry, with an absolute Necessity apparent to the Lodge. 2. BEHAVIOUR AFTER THE LODGE Is Ovga AND THE BRETHREN NOT GONE. You may enjoy yourself with ifinocent Mirth, treating one another according to Ability, but I"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"K 82 INDEANA MASONIC MONITOR avoiding Excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occasions call him, or doing or saying anything offensive, or that may forbid an Easy and Free Conversation; for that would blast our Harmony, and defeat our laudable Pur - poses. Therefore, no private Piques or Quarrels must be brought within the Door of the Lodge, far less any quarrels about Religion, or Nations or State Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Universal Religion above mentioned; we are also of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds, and Languages, and are resolved against All Politicks, as what never yet conduced to the Welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. 3. BEHAVIOUR WHEN BRETHREN MEST WITH - OUT STRANGERS BUT NOT ]N A. LODGE FORMED. You are to salute one another in a courteous manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freely giving mutual instruction as shall be thought expedient, Without being over - seen or overheard, and without encroaching on each other, or derogating from that respect which is due ~o any Brother, were he not a Mason. For though all Masons are as Brethren upon the same Level, yet Masonry takes no Honour from a man that he had before; nay, rather it adds to his Honour, especially if he has deserv’d well of the Brotherhood, who must give Honour to whom it is due, and avoid Ill Manners. 4. BEHAVIOUR IN PRESENCE OF STRANGERS NOT 1’VIASONS. You should be cautious in your Words and Car - riage, that ~he most penetrating Stranger should THE ANCIENT CHARGES 38 not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and sometimes you may divert a discourse, and manage it prudently for the Honour of the Worshipful Fraternity. 5. BEHAVIOUR AT HOME, AND IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise Man; particularly not to let your Family, Friends and Neighbors know the Concerns of the Lodge, etc., but wisely to consult your own honour, and that of the Ancient Brotherhood, for Reasons not to be mention’d here. You must also consult your Health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from home, after Lodge Hours are past; and by avoiding of Gluttony or Drunkenness, that your Family be not neglected or injured, nor you dis - abled from working. 6. BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS A STRANGE BROTHER. You are cautioned to examine him, in such a Manner as Prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant false pre - tender, whom you are to reject with Contempt and Derision, and beware of giving him any Hints of Knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or direct him bow he may be reliev’d: You must employ him some Days, or else recommend him to be employ’d. But you are not charg’d to do beyond your Ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, and a Good Man and True, before any other People in the same Circumstances."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"______________________ — ~ 14 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR FINALLY, all these Charges you are to observe, and also those that shall be communicated unto you in Another Way; cultivating Brotherly-Love, the Foundation and Cap-stone, the Cement and Glory of this ancient Fraternity, avoid all Wrang. ling and Quarreling, all slander and Back-biting, nor permitting others to slander any honest Brother, but defending his Character, and doing him all good Offices, so far as is consistent with your Honour and Safety, and no further.

Its principles are pro - claimed as widely as men will hear. Its only secrets tire in its met:hods of recognition and of symbolic lristructrnn. It is charitable in that it is not organized for profit and none of its income inures to the benefit of any individual, but all is devoted to the promo - tion of the welfare and happiness of mankind. It is benevolent in that it teaches and exempli - fies altruism as a duty. It is educational in that it teaches by prescribed ceremonials a system of morality and brotherhood based upon the Sacred Law. It is religious in that: it teaches monotheism, the Volume of the Sacred Law is open upon its altars whenever a Lodge is in session, reverence for God is ever present in its ceremonial, and to its brethren are constantly addressed lessons of morality; yet it is not sectarian or theological. It is a social organization only so far as it furnishes additional inducement that men may foregather in numbers, thereby providing more material for its primary work of education, of worship, and of charity. Through the improvement and strengthening of the character of t:he individual man, Freemasonry seeks to improve t:he community. Thus it impresses upon its members the principles of personal righteousness and personal responsibility, enlight - ens them as to those things which make for human welfare, and inspires them with that feeling of charity, or good will, toward all mankind which 1 In order to correct any misunderstanding and to refute will - ful misrepresentation, this “Declaration of Principles” was adopted by the Grand Lodge of Indiana on May 14, 1919 It merely puts in concrete form what we have taught and practiced since the beginning of our Grand Lodge.

It believes that the attainment of these objec - tives is best accomplished by laying a broad basis of principle upon which men of every race, country, sect, and opinion may unite rather than by setting up a restricted platform upon which only those of certain races, creeds, and opinions can assemble. Believing these things, this Grand Lodge affirms its continued adherence to that ancient and ap - proved rule of Freemasonry which forbids the discussion in Masonic meetings of creeds, polit:ics, or other topics likely to excite personal animosit,es. It further affirms its conviction that it is not only contrary to the fundamental principles of Freemasonry, but dangerous to its unity, strength, usefulness, and welfare, for Masonic Bodies to take action or attempt to exercise pressure or influence for or against any legislation, or in any way to attempt to procure the election or appointment of government offic]als, or to influence them, whether or not: members of the Fraternity, in the perform - ance of their official dut:ies. The true Freemason will act in civil life according to his individual judgment and the dictates of his conscience. r TIlE ANCIENT LANDMARKS “The ancient landmarks of the Order, entrusted to your care, you are carefully to preserve.... “Landmarks in Freemasonry are certain uni - versal, unalterable, and unrepealable fundamen - tals which have existed from time immemorial and are so thoroughly a part of Masonry that no Masonic authority may derogate from them or do aught but maintain them.”’ The Grand Lodge F. & A. M. of Indiana, in common with several other Grand Jurisdictions, has never officially adopted a specific list of An - cient Landmarks; although it recognizes their ex - istence by direct references to them in ritual and ceremonies. Throughout the Masonic world, there is a marked divergence of opinion as to what actually do constitute all of the true Landmarks of Free - masonry; and a rather wide variety are recognized by various Grand Lodges. The seven which follow, however, are common to all. Thus they may be considered as universally acceptable wherever Landmarks have been officially adopted. It is not the intention of this very brief review to infer that the following list is exhaustive or exclusive. It merely presents those Landmarks upon which all authorities apparent:ly agree, thus indicating to the thoughtful Craftsman the fun - damental nature of Landmarks, as well as a sound basis upon which to approach a more thorough study of this interesting and important subject. The following Landmarks are common to all officially adopted lists: 1 The Leadmarlis. by Roscoe Pound, 19i6 MSSB. Proc., 505."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"55 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR (1) ZIlono theism is the sole dogma of Freema - sonry. Belief in one God is required of every initiate, but his conception of the Supreme Being is left to his own interpretation. Free - masonry is not concerned with theological dis - tinctions. This is the basis of our universality. (2) Belief in Immortality is the ultimate lesson of Masonic philosophy. “The soul of man is the highest product of God’s creative handi - work. Now, after God has spent untold time in creating man and endowing him with a soul, which is the reflection of His image, is it reasonable to suppose that man lives here on earth for a brief span and then is ex - tinguished by death?” 2 (3) The Volume of the Sacred Law is an indis - pensable part of the furniture of a Lodge. In our jurisdiction it is usually the Bible, but any candidate not a Christian may have sub - stituted for it any other volume he considers sacred: e.g., the Old Testament, Koran, Vedas, or Laws of Confucius. In one Lodge in China, there are three Sacred Books open on the altar at the same timo, and the candidate elects one of the three on which to be obligated. (4) The Legend of the Third Degree. This is the most important and significant of the leg - endary symbols of Freemasonry. It has de - scended from age to age by oral tradition, and has been preserved in every Masonic rite, practlced in any country or language, with no essential alteration. (5) Masonic Secrecy includes only methods of recognition and of symbolic instruction. It does not extend to everything relating to the institution. A. secret society is one whose Michael Pupin r THE ANCIENT L ANDMARKS 59 members are not publicly known, and whose existence is concealed from the world. Masonic bodies, however, meet openly; there is no se - crecy concerning membership or officers; and Masonic symbols and philosophy are discussed in thousands of books accessible to anyone. Masonry has no part in subversive activlties, yet its secrets belong to the fraternity just as the private affairs of a family are its own concern. (6) Symbolism of the Operative Art means that Masonic symbols are taken from architecture. Almost without exception they relate to the bualding art:: Square, Level, Plumb, A.shlars, Pillars, Trestle-Board, etc. The grand idea of Masonry is that the development of character is like the Building of a Temple; the same rules apply to both. There must first be a plan, then a foundation and framework, and finally, proportion and harmony of line. There must be “wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings.” This is a practical truth of universal application to all forms of achieve - inent. The symbols of Freemasonry are drawn from the experience of the ages. (7) A Mason must be a freeborn male adult pri - manly because he must be master of his time, his resources, and himself. In Operative Masonry women and young men could not work at the mason’s trade; so traditionally membership in the Craft has been con fineA to male adults, and from long usage this prac - tice has become imbedded in the Fraternity as a Landmark. ~Adapted from Manual for Lodges of Instruction, by cour - tesy of the Grand Lodge A. F. & A. M. of Massachusetts.)"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"BASIC MASONIC PHILOSOPHY 41 PART II INTRODUCTORY BASIC MASONIC PHILOSOPHY Behind the ceremonies of all Masonic degrees lies a fundamental conception of this world in which we live and man’s place in it. It is based on the belief common to all religions and to almost all systems of philosophy that there exists some - where a Supreme Being who created this world, and of whom all mankind are the instruments and servants. With the particular attributes of this Supreme Being, and the manner and form in which He should be worshiped, Masonry has no concern. It emphasizes three fundamental ideas: first, that God exists; second, that men are put into this world to exercise their faculties and work as God’s instruments; and third, that their work is to be performed in accordance with certain principles of morality and justice which are in - dicated by the laws of Nature and by revelation contained in Sacred Writings. Freemasonry has no sacred book of its own. [a our Jurisdiction it adopts the Bible as a symbol of all Sacred Books. The Masonic ritual has to do with the building of a great Temple. In the erection of this Temple many workmen are engaged, divided into crafts according to their ability and skill and directed by overseers who are called masters and wardens. The work is proceeding according to the plan of a Great Architect. None of the masters or work - men know why the Temple is being built or what use is to be made of it after it is built. Nor do the master or the wardens or any of the workmen know the whole plan. The Architect furnishes only (lcsigns, drawn on a Trestle-Board, from which each craftsman is given the details he must know iii order to carry out that part of the work which it is his duty to perform. The workmen merely know that each must work with all his heart and soul and strength and to the utmost of his ability tind skill, because the Great Architect has orde red It: so. Each understands that the successful completion of the work depends not only on his individual offort but also on the united codperation and harmony of the Craft. Each understands also that there can be no cessation of the work until the Temple is completed, at which time the Great Architect has let it be known that the whole design will be disclosed as well as the object and purpose of its building. This is no fanciful picture designed for an evening’s entertainment, but is intended to represent and does faithfully represent the life of man. He finds that in this world he must work if he is to receive the wages of life, which consist not merely of a “living”: food, clothing, and shelter; but those equally essential satisfactions: interest in life, happiness, and contentment. He finds that he cannot choose the work he would like to do, but must adapt himself to conditions and circum - stances imposed by a power outside himself. He gets his directions for doing his work from study of the forces and the laws that govern the natural world and from written words of wisdom embodied in what are known as Sacred Volumes, or Bibles. He finds that he cannot work alone, that his work is dependent on mankind and they on him, where - fore are formed governments, societies, and other organizations for co6perative effort. He sees many things happen to himself and to others the reason"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"42 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR MONITORIAL for which he cannot fathom. At one time the world seems good, at another bad. Sometimes the work he is doing appears without purpose and without result. He continues to put forth effort only be - cause he must. The ritual harmonizes these discordant impres - sions. The Temple that is being built is the Temple of character; the great books of nature and re - velation are the Trestle-Board; the voice of con - science is their interpreter; man is the workman; and the Supreme Architect is God. (From—Manual for Lodges of Instruction, the Grand Lodge of Massachusetta). MONITORIAL OPENING AND CLOSING LODGE Ceremony—an act or series of acts in formal and dignified procedure oftentimes symbolical, im - pressive, and profound—had its origin in the very beginnings of human society. No lawful communi - cation of any Lodge can be held without the ceremony of opening and closing with appropriate rites and dignity. This has been universally prac - ticed among Freemasons from time immemorial. Such a procedure impresses awe and reverence upon the receptive mind. It also attracts attention to certain solemn and necessary rites which are fundamental to our precepts and practices. To begin well augurs for a successful and harmonious ending; and when order and method are neglected at the beginning, they will seldom be found in evidence at the end. To conduct the ceremonies of opening and clos - ing a Lodge properly and with that degree of dignity and excellence worthy of their lofty pur - poses, should be the particular study of every Mason. Those who have the time-honored privilege pP officiating should be especially attentive to their duties. Toward these brethren every eye is na - turally directed for propriety of manner and itinduct. From them our brethren who are less Inrormed will expect an example worthy of imita - tion. No Mason present can be exempted from a nhare in these ceremonies. They are a general eoncern in which all must assist. OPE~JING FIRST: Congregate—At the sound of the Worship - ful Master’s gavel, the officers and brethren assume their places, properly clothed. Con - versation ceases as all are seated. SECOND: Purge—Under the direction of the Senior Warden, the right of each one to be present is ascertained, in a manner prescribed by the ritual. (See sections on “Avouchment” and “Examination of Visitors” on page 45). THIRD: Tile—Make certain that the outer avenues or approaches to the Lodge are securely guarded. FOURTH: Lecture, Notice of Intent and Concur - rence—The Worshipful Master interrogates his officers concerning their duties and gl’ves formal notice of his intent to open his Lodge, to all present. Certain esoteric rites are em - ployed by means of which each brother signi - fies his concurrence in the ceremonies, and his knowledge o! the degree on which the Lodge is to be opened. FIFTH: Prayer—Every Mason is taught that no man should ever enter upon any great or im - portant undertaking without first invoking the blessings of Deity. The Lodge therefore addresses an appropriate prayer to the — ________________ ~ —.———.—-— —. ——"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"44 INDIANA MASONIC IIONITOR G.A.O.T.U., through its Chaplain, the Wor - shipful Master, or any brother present. (See “Prayers,” page 45.) SIXTH: Three Great Lights—With due reverence and solemnity, the Three Great Lights are displayed in a manner characteristic for each degree. The Senior Deacon should be parti - cula rly careful that the arrangement is exact and distinctive. (The hinge of the Compass should point toward the East.) SEVENTH: Declaration—This is the true official opening, regardless of a previous declaration of intent. The opening is the act of the Master. EIGHTH: Three Lesser Lights—These Lights are now illuminated. NINTH: Notice to Tiler—The Tiler is informed that the ceremony of opening is complete. He should not give an alarm for any brother desiring admission until after this notice is received. O~ BEHAVIOUR IN THE LODGE WHILE IN SESSION (Adapted from the Ancient Charges) The brethren are not to hold private committees oi- separate conversations without leave from the i’d aster, nor talk of anything impertinent, behave unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens or any other speaking to the Master, nor behave themselves in an unbecoming manner while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn, nor use personal or unbecoming language upon any pretense whatever. . . . No private piques or quarrels shall be brought within the door of the Lodge, far less any discussion or differences which are concerned with religion, race or politics. r MONITORIAL 45 CLOSING In closing the Lodge, a ceremony similar to the opening takes place. Here the less important duties of Masonry are observed. The necessary degree of subordination in the government of a Lodge is peculiarly marked, while the proper tribute of gratitude is offered up to the beneficent Author of life, and His blessing invoked and extended to the whole Fraternity. Each brother faithfully locks up the treasure he has acquired, in his own secret repository, and, pleased with his reward, retires to enjoy and dis - seminate among the private circle of his brethren the fruits of his labor and industry in the Lodge. These are faint outlines of ceremonies which universally prevail among Masons in every coun - try, and distinguish all their meetings. It is arranged as a general section in every degree, and takes the lead in all our illustrations. (Webb’s Monitor.) PRAYERS A Lodge cannot be lawfully opened or closed without some form of prayer. It is not without significance, however, that at no place in any Masonic ceremony is a specified prayer required. Prayer that does not come from the heart and soul of the supplicant is a mockery. At the appropriate place in the opening and closing Ceremonies, an extemporaneous prayer may be offered; pr the Chaplain, the Worshipful Master, or any designated brother, may use one of the following. PRAYERS APPROPRIATE TO THE OPENING OF A LODGE (1) Supreme Ruler of the Universe, we would reverently invoke Thy blessing at this time;"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"46 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR wilt Thou be pleased to grant that this meet - ing, thus begun in order, may be conducted in peace and closed in harmony. Amen. Re - sponse—So Mote It Be. (2) Supreme Architect of the Universe, in Thy name we have assembled, and in Thy name we desire to proceed in all our doings. Grant that the sublime principles of Freemasonry may so subdue every discordant passion with - in us; so harmonize and enrich our hearts with Thine own love and goodness, that the Lodge at this time may humbly reflect that beauty and order which reign forever before Thy throne. Amen. Response—So Mote It Be. PRAYERS APPROPRIATE TO THE CLOSING OF A LODGE (II) And now may the blessing of Heaven rest upon us and all regular Masons; may broth - erly love prevail, and every moral and social virtue cement us. Amen. Response—So Mote It Be. (2) Supreme Grand Master, Ruler of Heaven and Earth: Now that we are about to separate and return to our respective places of abode, wilt Thou be so pleased to influence our hearts and minds that we may each one of us prac - tice out of the Lodge those great moral duties which are inculcated in it, and with reverence study and obey the laws which Thou hast given us in Thy holy Word. Amen. Response— So Mote It Be. SIGNIFICANCE OF “AMEN” A~D “So MOTE IT BE” Although these terms are synonymous in one sense, the word “Amen” has a broader meaning than simply “so be it,” or our Masonic response “So Mote It Be.” Many consider “Amen” to signify r TS~ONITOR!AL 47 “that is all,” or “the end”; but its real equivalent might be better understood as a repet]tion of the whole prayer, or summarized in the words, “Oh Cod, I pray this l” as though one who had con - cluded his prayer would say: “This is my prayer; Oh God, hear it!” Frequently “Amen” is used as a response, ut - tered by the hearers and not the speaker, and it thus has the meaning “so be it,” the hearer sig - nifying that he adopts as his own the words which have been said by the speaker. Masonry does not use the word •‘Amen” in this sense, but instead uses’the phrase “So Mote It Be.” Some Masons have advanced the idea that “Amen” has a direct connection with “that which was lost,” and is “the symbol of completion and establishment, the full realization of all that shall be ours when the temple is completed and master - ship shall be attained.” 1 Although an interesting possibility, this is merely symbolic conjecture, of course. In Revelation 8:14, God is called “The Amen.” - - These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.” Other Biblical references can be found concerning this widely used word. For example, “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlast - ing to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord.” Psalms 106 :48. RECEPTION OF VISITORS Since time immemorial, the Fraternity has rec - ognized “the right of every Freemason to visit and sit in every regular Lodge.” This right is qualified by two factors: first, the visitor must l”Masonic Symbolism,” by Charles C. Hunt"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"45 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR 49 MONITOREAL prove that he is a regular Mason, in good standing in a regular Lodge; and, second, the Master may exclude any visitor who might seriously disturb the peace and harmony of his Lodge, at his discretion. (No visitor can be admitted to a Lodge while a single member present objects; nor can an objecting member be required to assign his reasons therefor, but may do so if he chooses. General Regulations.) AVOUCHMENT A visitor must prove his standing as a Free - mason by strict trial, due examination, or lawful information. The latter includes the privilege of “Avouchment” by a brother who is himself known. No avouchment can be accepted however, except from a brother who is present in the Lodge at the time; and no brother can legally vouch for a visitor unless he has actually sat with him in some regular Lodge. The voucher cannot exteUd to a higher degree than the degree at which they were both present. In any and every event, the visitor must exhibit evidence that his current dues are paid in full. If no brother present can legally vouch for a visitor, he must submit to an examination by a committee appointed for the purpose by the Wor - shipful Master. EXAMINATION “You are cautiously to examine him, in such a method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant false pretender . . . and beware of giving him any hints of knowledge.” (Ancient Charges). The examination o! a visitor consists of three essential parts: (1) Documentary Evidence: Visitor must exhibit an official receipt for current dues, and may offer such other evidence of his Masonic po - sition ~s he wishes, such as diplomas, letters of introduction, etc. (2) The Test Oath.’ With his right hand on the Holy Bible, let him take the test oath in the following form: “I, A— B—, in the presence of Almighty God, do hereby and hereon most solemnly swear that I have been regularly initiated, passed, and raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason, in a just and lawfully con - stituted Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons; that I am nut suspended or expelled, and know of no just cause why I should be. So help me God.” Require him to kiss the Bible. (Note: A visitor has the right to call for and inspect the charter of the Lodge before he takes the test oath.)

Traditionally, the Fleece refers to the Golden Fleece, which, according to the old Greek legend, was the cause of the expedition of the Argonauts, led by Jason Since it was first instituted, this Order has been considered, on the Continent of Europe, as the highest and most impoi’tant of all civil Orders. It has no standing in England, however, hence we hear little about it now. The “Roman Eagle” was highly famous amongst the Ro - mans. It was a figure of an Eagle with outafretched wings, sometimes of silver, occasionally of gold, but more frequently of bronze, carried in the same way as a standard or banner, e, at the bead of a staff. The Romans took the idea from the Persians and fist introduced it about B.C., 104, as an emblem of honor to be carried before their chief ruler. The great Roman Eagle was the highest emblem of dignity, honor and power in that mighty nation. The “Order of the Garter” is the highest Order of Knight - hood in Great Britain, and amongst the various Orders in the world it is considered to be the most honorable and the most exclusiv~. It was first called, and is still sometimes referred to as, “The Order of St George” Its present full title is “The Most Noble Order of the Garter.” . . . The “Star” and the “Garter” are not two separate Orders, but the two together form the principal parts of the insignia of one Order. The high estimation in which the “Order of the Garter” is held, both here and abroad, partly accounts for its being mentioned so prominently in the words of recom - mendation to the young Mason.

The common gavel is an instrument made use of by operative masons, to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our minds and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life; thereby fitting our bodies as living stones, for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heav~ns."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Is INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR CHARGE AT INITIATION INTO THE E.A. DEGREE My Brother: As you are now introduced into the first principles of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honor - able Order; ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial; and honorable, as tending in every partIcular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ver raised on a better principle, or a more solid Ioundation~ nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down, than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men in all ages have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have never deemed it derogatory from their dignity to level themselves with the fraternity, extend their privileges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—to God, your neigh - bor, and yourself. To God in never mentioning His name, but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and to esteem Him as the Chief Good; to your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you; and to yourself, in avoiding all ir - regularity and intemperance, which may impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your pro - fession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. NOTS: This is a very old charge. The substance of it was written in 1774 hy Hutchinson, and published in his “Spirit of Masonry.” Preston considerably enlarged and impraved it subsequently, and inserted it in his ‘Illustrations Webb afterward reduced it to its present abridged form, simply by omitting many of Preston’s paragispha.

In your outward demeanor be particularly care - ‘ul to avoid censure or reproach. Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity, or in - Iluence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action. Although your frequent appearance at our meet - ings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations; f or these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal f or the institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give as you will be ready to receive instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the Order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your con - sequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly attentive not to recommend him, unless you are convinced he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects.

The stones were all hewn, squared and numbered in the quarries where they were raised; the timbers felled and prepared in the forests of Lebanon, carried by sea in floats to Joppa, and from thence by land to Jerusalem, where they were set up by wooden mauls pre - pared for that purpose; and when the building was erected, its several parts fitted with such exactness that it had more the appearance of being the handiwork of the Supreme Architect of the Universe, than that of human hands. Masonry regards no man for his worldly wealth or honors. The internal and not the external qualifications of a man should render him worthy to be made a Mason. We read in the Book of Ruth thaI~ “this was the manner in former times concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor, and this was a testimony in Israel.” —Ruth 4:7. “Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.”—St. Matthew 7:7—also St. Luke .11 :9.

He, therefore, who wears the Lamb-skin apron as a badge of Masonry, is thereby constantly reminded of that purity of life and conduct which is essentially necessary to his gain - ing admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. In Operative Masonry the first stone of a build - ing is usually placed in the North-east corner.

It is as long as from East to West, as broad as from North to Sou~h, 3 as high as from the earth to the heavens, 1 A Charter is an instrument issued upon order of the Grand Lodge and executed by designated Masonic authority, em - powering the brethren named therein and their successors, when duly assembled, to perform all regular Masonic work. A Warrant is a similar instrument issued by the Grand Master during the recess of the Grand Lodge, which, for a limited period, empowers the brethren named therein to initiate, pass and raise all good mon and true who may apply for that purpose and whom they may find worthy, and also to do certain other Masonic work. Should you, being in a strange place and unknown, de - sire to visit a Lodge, it will be your duty to request of the committee sent to examine you that they show you some such instrument. If they do not, you will retire without per - mitting yourself to be examined, for, if they have it not, you may well consider them to be an assemblage of ir - regular Masons. 2 Before the erection of Templ~ for Divine worship, the celes - tial bodies were olten worshiped on hills and the terrestrial ones in valleys.

A Lodge is supported by three great pillars, called wisdom, strength, and beauty; because it is necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. They are represented by the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens. The Worshipful Mas - ter represents the pillar of Wisdom, it being sup - posed that he has wisdom to open his Lodge, set the Craft to work and give them proper instruc - tions.

The principal of these is charity; because our faith may be lost in sight, hope ends in fruition, but charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. THE FURNITURE OF A LODGE The furniture of a Lodge is the Holy Bible, Square, and Compass. The Bible points out the path that leads to happiness and is dedicated to God. The Square teaches us to regulate our con - duct by the principles of morality and virtue, and is dedicated to the Master. The Compass teaches us to limit our desires in every stat[on, and is dedicated to the Craft. The Bible is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man, and on it; we obligate a newly admitted brother; the Square to the Master, because being the proper Masonic emblem of his office, it is constantly to remind him of the duty he owes to the Lodge over which he is appointed to preside; and the Compass to the Craft, because, by a due attention to its use, they are taught to regulate their desires and keep their passions within due bounds. THE ORNAMENTS OF A LODGE The ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the Indented Tessel, that beautiful tesselated border ENTERED A PPR ENTICE o~. skirting which surrounded it; and the Blazing Htar in the center is commemorative of the star N w 111111 :,~ 9 ,-~4 -~ — - — — Iii —— 111111 S E which appeared to guide t;he wise men of the East ~o the place of our Saviour’s nativity.

SYMBOLIC LIGI~TS A Lodge has three lights, situated in the East, West, and South. There is none in the ~orth be - cause of the situation of King Solomon’s Temple, it being situated so far north of the ecliptic that the Sun or Moon at their meridian height could dart no rays into the northern part of it; and so we Masonically term the North a place of darkness.’ ‘In addition to the Three Great Lights and the Three Lesser Lights of l~lasonry, there are three Symbolic Lights of a 1K XX ~ 7 ~ Z ~n~#"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"66 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR THE JEWELS OF A LODGE #1 A Lodge has six jewels; three movable and three immovable. The immovable jewels are the Square, Level, and Plumb. The Square teaches morality; the Level equality; and the Plumb rec - titude of life. 2 The movable jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state; the Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen to be adjusted by the tools of a Fellow Craft; the Trestle Board is for the Master workman to draw his designs upon. Lodge, and their situation is represented by the three principal stations: the East, West and South. These three lights, like the three principal officers and the three principal supports, refer, undoubtedly, to the three stations of the sun—its rising in the east, its meridian in the south, and its setting in the west—and thus the symbolism of the Lodge, as typical of the world, continues to be preserved. The use of lights in all religious ceremonies is an ancient custom. There was a seven-branched candlestick in the taber - nacle, and in the Temple “were the golden candlesticks, five on the right hand and five on the left.” They were always typical of moral, spiritual, or intellectual light. 2 The Square, Level and Plumb are called immovable because worn by the Worshipful Master, Senior and ,funior Wardens, and they are always to be found in the East. West and South. 1 ENTERED APPRENTICE Hy the Rough Ashlar we are relrninded of our (IC and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect ‘ihiar, that state of perfection at which we hope arrive by a virtuous education, our own en - ‘tivors and the blessings of God; and by the Board we are reminded that as the opera - lIVe workman erects his temporal building agree - hilly to the rules and designs laid down by the M aster on His trestle board, so should we, both ~lcrative and speculative, endeavor to erect our Igliritual building agreeably to the rules and ,Iosigns laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the Book of Life, which is our t’lpiritual Trestle Board. SITUATION OF A LODGE Lodges are situated due East and West because that was the situation of King Solomon’s Temple. King Solomon’s Temple was so situated because, after Moses had safely conducted the Children of ‘l:srael through the Red Sea, when pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he then, by Divine com - mand, erected a tabernacle and set it due East and West, in order to perpetuate the remembrance of the mighty East wind by which their miraculous deliverance was wrought, and also to receive the rays of the rising sun; and as the Tabernacle was till exact model of King Solomon’s Temple, there - fore all Lodges should be situated due East and West.l DEDICATION OF A LODGE Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solo - mon In modern times they are dedicated to Fisemasonry, retaining in its symbolism the typical reference or the Lodge to the world, and constantly alluding to the sun In its apparent diurnal revolution, imperatively requires, when it can be done, that the Lodge should be situated due test and West, so that every ceremony shall remind the Mason 0 f the progress of that luminary."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"68 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE 69 St. John the Baptist and Saint John the Evan - gelist, who were eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time there is represented in every regular and well governed Lodge, a certain point within a circle, the point representing an mdi - ‘vidual brother, the circle representing the boun - dary line of his duty to God and man, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, prejudices or interests to betray him on any occasion. 2 This circle is embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines representing Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, who were perfect parallels in Christianity as well as Masonry; and upon the vertex rests the Book of Holy Scriptures, which points out the whole duty of man. In going round this circle we necessarily touch upon these two lines as well as upon the Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed it is impossible that he should materially err. TENETS The tenets of a l~dason’s profession are brotherly love, relief, and truth. 2 St. John the Daptist was the son of Zacharias and Elisabeth. The day which is celebrated in his honor is June 24th. St. John the Evangelist was Galilean by birth, the son of Zebedee and Salome We commemorate him on December 27th. The above dates were anciently established as Church Fes - tival Days. BROTHERLY Lovx By the exercise of Brotherly Love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family, the high and low, the rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent and inhabita,nts of the same planet, are to aid, support and protect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. TRUTH of Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity.

The ceremonial is solemn and imposing; its symbolism should be understood by all who would advance further in the sublime mysteries of Freemasonry. The Fellow Craft degree differs essentially from the Entered Apprentice, particularly in that the First degree of Masonry is symbolic and moral and is typical of the period of Youth; while the Second degree embraces history, science, and the liberal arts, and is emblematical of the period of manhood, with its increased duties and obligations. The mind of the recipient is fired, by the nature of its ritual, upon the wonders of nature and art; and he is charged to become familiar with these evidences of God’s bounty to mankind that he may be better enabled to occupy, with honor to himself and with profit to his fellow creatures, his allotted place in the great structure of human society. The allegory of Freemasonry is the building of King Solomon’s Temple at Jerusalem, and our most honored legends date from that epoch. The working tools there used furnish us with symbols, and many of our ceremonies are based upon con - ceptions practiced by its builders. In order to facil - itate the work of building and prevent confusion in the payment of wages, the craft were divided into three classes, according to Masonic legend, or, as we designate them, degrees; and to each class was assigned methods of recognition. The second FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE FOREWORD RECEPTION class, or Fellow Craft, received their wages of Corn, Wine and Oil in the Middle Chamber. Hence we say a Lodge of Fellow Crafts represents the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple, while that of the Entered Apprentice represents the Ground Floor. We term advancement to this degree as “passing” for in going from the ground floor to the middle chamber of King Solomon’s Temple one necessarily passed between two beautiful brazen pillars which have marked sig~nificance to Masons.

By Operative Masonry w~ allude to a proper application of the useful rules of Archi - tecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and con - venient shelter from the vicissitudes and inclemen - cies of the seasons. And while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligation to pay that rational homage to the Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the con- U"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"76 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR temp]ative to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of the creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator. We work as Speculative Masons onJy, but our ancient brethren worked in Operative as well as Speculative Masonry. They worked six days and then received their wages. They did not work on the seventh day, because in six days God created the heaven and the earth, and rested upon the seventh day. The seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunity to contemplate the glorious works of the creation, and to adore their great Creator. PILLARS OF THE PORCH (It was the custom of our ancient brethren to assemble on the evening of the sixth day of each week in the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple, there to receive their wages as Fellow Crafts. Their way thither led through a long porch or passage of the Temple, at the outer entrance of which were placed two large columns, or pillars.) These two great brazen pillars, the one on the right hand, the other on the left, are called Jachin and Boaz. The word Boaz denotes strength; the word J achin denotes establishment. These names collectively allude to the promise of God to David, that he would estab - lish his kingdom in strength. These pillars were cast in the clay grounds on the banks of Jordan, between Succoth and Zar - than, where all the vessels of King Solomon’s FELLOW CRAFT Temple were cast by Hiram Abif, the widow’s son, of the Tribe of Naphtali. They were cast hollow the better to 1 They were each thirty-five cubits in height and were adorned with chapiters of five cubits, making in all forty cubits in height. ~These were adorned with lily work, net work and pomegranates, de - noting Peace, Unity and Plenty. The lily, by its purity and the retired situation in which it grows, denotes Peace; the net work, by the intimate con - nection of its parts, denotes Unity; and the pomegranate, by the exuberance of its seeds, de - notes Plenty. These two pillars were further adorned with globes on their tops, representing the terrestrial and celestial spheres. lIt ia said the two brazen pillars were placed at the porch of King Solomona Temple as a memento to the children of Israel of their happy deliverance from the land of bondage, and reminded them of the pillar of cloud that overshadowed by day, and the pillar of fire that illuminated by night. ‘For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece; and a line of twelve cubito did compass either of them about. “And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to aet upon the topa of the pillara: the height of the one chapiter was five cubito, and the height of the other chapiter waa five cubits “—1 Kinga 7:15-16. “And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubito did compass it; and the thickneaa thereof waa four fingers: it wae hollow. “And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapitor was five cubits, with network and pomegranatos upon the chapitors round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these —Jeremiah 52 :21-22. (Further Biblical references to the Pillars of the Porch may be found in 2 Kings 25:17 2 Chronicles 1:16; and Ezekiel 40:49.) “CUBIT: A measure of length, originally denoting the distance from the elbow to the extremity of the middle finger, or the fourth part of a well-proportioned man’s stature. The Hebrew cubit, according to Bishop Cumberland. was twenty- one inches; but only eighteen according to other authorities.” (Mackey)."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"liii - 78 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR THE GLOBES The Globes are two artificial spherical bodies, on the convex surfaces of which are represented the countries, seas and various parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other particulars. The sphere with the parts of the earth delineated upon its surface is called the terrestrial globe, and that with the constel - lations and other heavenly bodies the celestial globe. The principal use of the globes, besides serving as maps to distinguish the outward parts of the earth, and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and explain the phenomena arising from the annual revolution and diurnal rotation of the earth around its own axis. They are the noblest instruments for improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or propo - sition, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and His works, and are induced to encourage the study oI~ Astronomy, Geography, Navigation, and the arts dependent on them, by which society has been so much benefited.

THE NUMBER THREE (There are three degrees conferred in every Lodge. The three principal officers of a Lodge are the Worshipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens.) FELLOW CRAFT 79 THE NUMBER FIVE ORDER [N ARCHITECTURE By order in architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornaments of columns and pilasters. Or it is a regular arrange - ment of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete work. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of the seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at the top and bottom, are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally pro. ceeded the more improved art of architecture. The Doric, THR FIVE ORDERS OF ARCHITECTURE five orders are thus classed: The Tuscan, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"~ 1F 80 INDIANA MASONIC MO~.IITOR THE TUSCAN The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It w~s invented in Tuscany, whence it derived its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the con - struction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. THE DornC The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, except mould - ings; though the frieze is distinguished by tri - glyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts ~of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state. In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric; for when it was constructed in its prim - itive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in its original state. THE IONIC The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion be - tween the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in FELLOW CRAFT 81 this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the famous temple ol~ Diana at Ephesus was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young woman, dressed in her hair, as in contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that ol~ a strong, robust man. THE CORINTHIAN The Corinthian, the richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, which sus - tains the abacus; the frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentils and modil - lions. This order is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth by Calli - machus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital ol~ this pillar from the following remark - able circumstance: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys, covered with a tile, placed over an acanthus root, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up they encompassed the basket, till, arriving at the tile they met with an obstruc - tion and bent downward. Callimachus, struck with the object, set about imitating the figure. The vase of the capital he made to represent the basket, the abacus the tile, and the volutes the bending leaves. THE COMPOSITE The Composite is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corin - thian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has the quarter-round as the Tuscan and Doric orders, is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentils I,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"82 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT 83 or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance and beauty are displayed. ANCIENT ORDERS OF ARCHITECTURE The ancient and original orders of architecture revered by Masons are no more than three: The Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show in - vention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other, the two others have noth - ing hut what is borrowed, and differ only acci - dentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Corinthian en - riched with the Ion[c. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious and distinct in architecture. THE FIVE SENSES OF HUMAN NATURE the five senses of human nature: Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. HEARING Hearing is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agree - able charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires, while thus our reason is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge by the information of others. For these purposes we are endowed with hearing, that by a proper exertion of our natural powers, our happiness may he complete. SEEING Seeing is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structure, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of nature. By this sense we find our way in the path - less ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more, by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and af - fections of our fellow creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that though the tongue may he taught to lie and dissemble, the counte - nance would display hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which administer to this sense are the most astonishing part of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye and its appurtenances, evince the admirable contrivance of nature for performing Ru its various external and internal motions, while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demonstrates this organ to be the masterpiece of nature’s work. ____________________________________________________________________________ C _________________________"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"- — ~ __ B4 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR FEELING Feeling is that sense by which we distinguish the different qualities of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smooth - ness, figure, solidity, motion and estension. These three senses, hearing, seeing and feeling, are deemed peculiarly essential among Masons. SMELLING Smelling is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different opinions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and indeed most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of vast subtlety, as well in the state of life and growth as in the state of putrefaction. These effluvia, being drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are means by which all bodies are smelled. Hence it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in res - piration. TASTING Tasting enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance to the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both organs it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting, and by it we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the different compo - sitions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. Smelling and Tasting are inseparably connected, FELLOW CRAFT 85 and it is by the unnatural kind of life men com - monly lead in society, that these senses are ren - dered less fit to perform their natural offices. On the mind all our knowledge must depend; what, therefore, can he a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons. By anatomical dis - section and observation we become acquainted with the body, hut it is by the anatomy of the mind alone we discover its powers and principles. To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God’s bounty to man, we shall add that memory, imagination, taste, reasoning, moral perception and all the active powers of the soul, present a vast and boundless field for philosophical disquisi - tion which far exceed human inquiry, and are peculiar mysteries known only to nature and to nature’s God, to whom we are all indebted for Creation, preservation and every blessing we enjoy. The first three of these human senses are most revered by Masons THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES The seven liberal arts and sciences are: Gram - mar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. GRAMMAR Grammar teaches the proper arrangement of words according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people, and that excellency of pro - nunciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeably to reason and correct usage."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"86 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR RHETORiC Rhetoric teaches us to speak copiously and flu - ently on any subject not merely with propriety alone, hut with all the advantages of force and elegance, wisely contriving to captivate the bearer by strength of argument and beauty of expression, whether it he to entreat or exhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC Logic teaches us to guide our reason discre - tionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument whence we infer, deduce and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted or granted, and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning and disposing, all of which naturally lead on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally determined. ARITHME’rIC Arithmetic teaches the powers and properties of numbers, which is variously affected by letters, tables, figures and instruments. By this art rea - sons and demonstrations are given for finding out any certain number whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. GEOMETRY Geometry treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered, from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a super - ficies to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure or an indivisible part of space. A line is a point continued and a figure of one capacity, namely, FELLOW CRAFT 87 length. A superficies is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, length, breadth and thickness. By this science the architect is enabled to con - struct his plans and execute his designs, the general to arrange his soldiers, the engineer to mark out grounds for encampments, the geogra - pher to give us the dimensions of the world and all things therein contained, to delineate the extent of the seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, geometry is the foundation of architecture and the root of mathematics. MUSIC Music teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose delightful harmony by a mathemati - cal and proportional arrangement of acute, grave and mixed sounds. This art, by a series of experi - ments, is reduced to a demonstrative science, with respect to tones and the intervals of sound. It inquires into the nature of concords and discords, and enables us to find out the proportion between them by numbers. ASTRONOMY Astronomy is that divine art by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the Almighty Creator in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere. Assisted by astronomy, we can observe the motions, measure the distances, comprehend the magnitudes, and calculate the periods and eclipses of the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globes, the system of the world, and the preliminary law of nature.

THE MORAL ADVANTAGES OF GSOMETRY Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Masonry is erected. By geometry we may curiously trace nature through her vari - ous windings to her most concealed recesses.

The Temple was supported by one thousand, four hundred and fifty-three columns, and two thousand, nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. 1 WORKMEN EMPLOYED There were employed in its building, three Grand Masters, three thousand, three hundred Masters or overseers of the work, eighty thousand Fellow Crafts in the mountains and in the quar- ries, and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices or bearers of burdens. All these were classed and arranged in such a manner by the wisdom of King Solomon that neither envy, discord nor confusion ‘was suffered to interrupt the universal peace and ti-anquillity which pervaded the world at this im - portant period. THE THREE STEPS The three steps usually delineated on the Master’s carpet, are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, namely: Youth, Manhood, and Age. In youth, as Entered Ap - prentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in manhood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties, to God, our neighbors and ourselves, so that in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy 1 For additional important data concerning King Solomon’s Temple, see page 151.

NINE CLASSES OF MASONIC EMBLEMS There are nine classes of Masonic emblems, eight of which are monitorial, namely: The Pot of Incense, the Bee H[ve, the Book of Constitu - tions guarded by the Tyler’s Sword, the Sword pointing to a Naked Heart, the Anchor and Ark, the Forty-Seventh Problem of Euclid, the Hour Glass, and the Scythe. THE POT OF INCENSE The Bee Hive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven, to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that as ‘we came into this world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones, never sitting down contented while our fellow creatures around us are in want, when it is in our power to relieve them without inconvenience to ourselves.

It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth, to have made man independent of all other beings; but as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and secur - ity, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities for fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friend - ship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavor - ing to add to the common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a useless member of society, and un - worthy of our protection as Masons. THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS GUARDED BY THE TYLER’S Swoiw The Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s Sword reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words, and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry, ever bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and circumspection. THE SWORD POINTING TO A NAKED HEART The Sword pointing to a Naked Heart demon - strates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, ‘words, and actions may be hidden from the eyes of man, yet that All- Seeing Eye 1, whom the Sun, Moon, and Stars 1 The All-Seeing Eye: “In most of the ancient languages of Asia ‘eye’ and ‘sun’ are expressed by the same word, and the ancient Egyptians hieioglyph,cally represented their principal deity, the sun-god Osiris. by the figuics of an open eye, emblematic of the sun, by whose light we are enabled to see, and which itself looks down from the midst of heaven and behold all things. In like manner Masons have emblematically MASTER MASON obey, and under whose watchful care even comets perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will award us according to our merits. THE ANCHOR AND ARK The Anchor and Ark are emblems of a well grounded hope and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that Divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that Anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary shall find rest. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID 2 The Forty- Seventh Problem of Euclid was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great Pythagoras, who in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of priesthood and raised to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general know - ledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems, and among the most dis - tinguished he erected this, which in the joy of his heart he called Eureka, in the Grecian language signifying, “I have found it” and upon the dis - covery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. 5 representod the omniscience of the Oreat Architect of the Universe.” —Brown, “Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy” 2 This problem is thus stated by Euclid: “In any right-angled triangle, the square which is described upon the side sub - tending the right angle is equal to the sum 0! the squares described upon the sides which contain the right angle.” —Euclid, Book 1, Problem 47. 2 HECATO NIB—”A sacrifice of a hundred oxen or cattle at the same time.” (Webetor)."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"106 INDIANA !~1ASONIC MONITOR It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. THE HOUR GlASS The Hour Glass is an emblem of human life. Behold, how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close.

Thus wastes man. Today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; Ihe next day comes a frost which nips the shoot, and when he thinks his greatness still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. THE SCYTHE The Scythe is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life and launches us into eternity. Behold, what havoc the Scythe of Time makes among the human race; if, by chance, we should escape the numerous evils incident to child - hood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive at the years of manhood, yet withal we must be cut down by the all-devouring Scythe of Time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us.

KING SOLOMON’S TEMPLE We read in the Holy Writings that it was decreed in the wisdom of Deity aforetime, that a house should be built, erected to God and dedicated to His Holy Name. We also learn from the same sacred source, that David, King of Israel, desired to build the house, but, that in consequence of his reign having been one of many wars and much bloodshed, that distinguished privilege was de - nied him. He was not, however, left without hope, for God promised him that out of his loins there should come a man who would be adequate to the performance of so great and glorious an undertaking. 1 The “Sprig of Acacia” has a solemn importance in the Masonic system. The acacia is a tree, noted for its flexible leaves of yellowish green, which droop down and wave in the breeze. It held a sacred place in the ancient initiations, and, like the weeping~willow, was the symbol of tonder sym - pathy and undying affection.

He commenced it in the fourth year of his reign, and that he might prosecute the work with greater expedition, he applied to Hiram, King of Tyre, the ancient friend and ally of his father, to furnish him ‘with timber in abundance, cedar trees, fir trees and algum trees, out of Lebanon; and also to send him a man “cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue,” and that could “skill to grave with the cunning men” of Judah and Jerusalem. Hiram, King of Tyre, cordially responded, not only furnishing the cedar and cypress of Lebanon, but also sent him Hiram, the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali. He was the most skillful and accomplished artist of his age. From his designs and under his direction, all the rich and splendid furniture of the Temple was begun, car - ried on and finished. So highly was this distin - guished master esteemed by Solomon, for his talent, his virtues and unblemished integrity, that he appointed him principal surveyor and master of the work. KINO SOLOMON’S TEMPLE 1.09 The magnificent Temple of Solomon, which long challenged the admiration of the world, far ex - ceeded in splendor all other structures which had hitherto been erected. It was begun in the month of April, four hundred and eighty years after the Children of Israel came out of Egypt; and was finished in October, seven years later. The Temple was located on Mount Moriah, near the place where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and where David met and appeased the Destroying Angel, which was visible over the threshing-floor of Oman, the Jebusite. The construction of this grand edifice was at- tended with two remarkable circumstances. From Josephus we learn that although more than seven years were occupied in building it, yet during the whole term it rained not in the day time, that the workmen might not be obstructed in their labor; and from sacred history it appears that there was neither the sound of the hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard in the house while it was building. The preparations for this Temple were immense. There were employed in it vast quantities of gold, and silver, and precious stones. Everything was made ready before it came to the spot, that noth. ing was to do but join the materials. The top of Mount Moriah, on which it was erected, was in- closed with a wall. Into this there was an entrance on every side. Into this outer Court, every clean Hebrew, or proselyte of the covenant, might enter. In the middle of the outer Court but nearer to the west end, there was a court of the Levites, stretch - ing from east to west and surrounded by a low wall of about four feet high, that the people might, over the top of it, see what was doing by 105 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR That promise was verified in the person and character of Solomon, his son, who ascended the throne, after David was gathered to his fore - fathers.

This Court had two entrances, one on the north side, the other on the south. In this Court, just before the east end of the Temple, stood the brazen altar, and the brazen sea and layers. The Temple, stood from east to west, near the west end of the Court of the Priests. On each side of its entrance, at the Porch of the Temple, stood the two celebrated Pillars of brass; they wer~’ regarded as a striking memento of the promise of God that he would establish the throne of David and make the nation of Israel strong in His might. Passing through this Porch you entered the Sanctuary, or Holy Place, at the west end of which stood the golden candlesticks; on the south side, and on the north, the ten golden tables, containing the loaves of shew-bread and the innumerable golden vessels for the service of the sanctuary, and in the middle between them stood the golden altar of incense. Passing through the Sanctuary lengthwise, you entered by a fine veil and a two-leaved door of olive tree, into the Oracle, or Most Holy Place, into which the High Priest only might enter, and that only once each year, on the Day of Atonement. In the Most Holy Place stood the Ark with its furniture; and Solomon made two new cherubim of olive-tree, which overshadowed the two golden ones and stretched their wings the whole breadth of the House. The wall of the House was reared with alternate layers of fine cedar wood and hewn marble; the inside was carved with figures of cherubim and palm trees, and the whole inside, floor, walls and roof, was overlaid ‘with gold, and set with innumerable diamonds and precious stones. In the erection of this superb edifice, we per - ceive not only the piety but the ‘wisdom of Solomon. The arts had reached their highest state of per - fection, and every species of knowledge peculiar to the Craft was lavished upon it.

You are now a Master Mason, a member of an ancient and honorable institution; so ancient that its mystic symbols are found among the ruins of buried cities, carved by forgotten peoples on the tombs of bygone kings and on the rocks in secret caverns; so ancient that its origin is lost in the midst of tradition; honorable because from time immemorial its principles and teachings have been the inspiration of great men, the men who have led in the march of human progress. The principles of Liberty, Equality, and Fra - ternity, which are the very foundation of our great Republic, were evolved ages ago by brothers of ours ‘who did not even know of the ezistence of this new world; and we stand fast as a free people because our Nation has ever been loyal to those principles and standards of morality which are taught by Masonry, those basic principles and ideals conceived by our ancient brethren and handed down in secret conclave from generation to generation, finally finding expression in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitu - tion of a free Government. Masonry, therefore, is constructive in its teach - ing; it seeks to b,uild rather than tear down. The world needs builders, and ‘we welcome you to our ranks. If you study Masonry it will become a part of your very being, for every symbol and every observance has some application to your own life. And you must continue in your search for the secrets of a Master Mason, those secrets which will enable you to be a better builder; for we are I K 116 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR promised to befriend and relieve every brother who shall need your assistance.

As Masons we are building on foundations laid by our brothers before the dawn of history; and the work must go on in generations yet to come until the mission of Masonry is fulfilled, until there is no further need of Service, until God’s plan is accomplished.

If you feel that in your initiation, passing, and raising, you have experienced the height of your ambition, then all that is necessary in order that you may continue to enjoy these privileges is that you pay your dues promptly each year and continue to live a respectable life. We hope, however, that in your progress through the degrees, even in your limited experience of Masonry, you have caught a glimpse of value far beyond the mere privileges of membership; some - thing greatly to be desired, something worth striv - ing for, something which can become a vital force in your life. Masonry is truly a progressive science; and as we advance in kno’wledge, our obligations to ourselves and to our brethren cor - respondingly increase. No man has been able to go far enough into the past to find the beginnings of Masonry, nor has he been able to look far enough into the future to see its ultimate goal. No man has ever climbed to the highest peak of Masonic experience or dug to the deepest depth of Masonic truth. If Masonry is to mean to you all that it should, you must first of all regard it as a philosophy of life relationship and be willing to give it the steady loyalty that such an important matter deserves. With loyalty there must be an inquiring mind, insisting upon knowing something of the structure and purpose of Masonry, the meaning of its symbols, its tremendous background, its ethical demands, its tolerance, and its great lesson of Brotherhood — a Brotherhood not limited to the confines of a Lodge or of the state or even of the nation; for Masonry is a World Brotherhood. If you have in some measure caught the deeper significance of the ceremonies in ‘which you have participated, you may perceive upon your own personal trestle-board the shadowy outlines of a new structure, a Temple which you are to build, a Temple of character, a spiritual Temple which is to be your life work.

Every symbol of a lodge is a religious teacher, the mute teacher also of morals and philosophy. It is in its ancient symbols and in the kno’wledge of their true meanings that the pre-eminence of Freemasonry over all other orders consists. In other respects, some of them may compete with it, rival it, perhaps even excel it; but by its symbols it will reign without a peer when it learns again what its symbols mean, and that each is the embodiment of some great, old, rare, truth.”’ “In our Masonic studies, the moment we forget that the ‘whole and every part of Freemasonry is symbolic or allegoric, the same instant we begin to grope in the dark. Its ceremonies, signs, tokens, words, and lectures at once become meaningless or trivial. The study of no other aspect of Free - masonry is more important, yet the study of no aspect of it has been so much neglected.” 2 “Take from Freemasonry its symbols and but the husk remains, the Ilernel is gone. He who hears but the words of Freemasonry misses their meaning en - tirely.” 3 These brief quotations firmly establish the vital role of symbolism in the Masonic system. It seems fitting, therefore, that every Craftsman should 1 Albert Pike. 2 Symbolism of the Three Degrees, by Oliver Day Street. 3 Introduction to Freemasoncy, by Carl H. Claudy."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"MASONIC SYMBOLISM By drama, story and symbol, the eye, the ear and the recollection continually enrich the mind and quicken the conscience of the thinking members of the Craft.”~ Symbols are more vivid than words. They can express more than words can say. Who can explain a flower, or say what a melody means? “If in Masonry we speak of a Temple, we do not mean one of stone and mortar. If we spea1~ of a square, we do not mean one of steel or wood. If we speak of the compass, we do not mean one of metal.” 6 Symbols are more impressive than words. The person who sees the symbol makes his own inter - pretation. The thought then is his own. He has done more than see the symbol; he has created an idea. That is important! For a man holds to his own ideas, and remembers them; and a symbol can express in a flash a whole series of ideas; thus it does the work of many speeches. “The story of Freemasonry, like other records told by the tongue would become stale by repeti - tion and fall upon the, ear less vigorously each succeeding time we heard it, were it not that the facts historical and the philosophies social and individual are linked to words by pictures, an orderly system of spoken sounds and symbols illustrating and impressing the eye and the ear simultaneously. . . For this reason Freemasonry uses the simplest of symbols; the tools and ma - terials of the Stonemason’s trade are sufficient for this purpose and they are found everywhere. . “Our symbols are truly the quarried treasures of the Fraternity, set forth to be applied by each of us in the upbuilding of his character.. .

The science is of no avail unless it leads to the practice of the art, and though we should possess all knowledge and be able in beauti - ful and sublime language to utter the thoughts that arise in us as we contemplate the glorious work of our Order, it profiteth us nothing. It is not by intellectual attainment or oral expression that we become Masons, but by the way in which we acquire the science and couple it with the art of Temple building, and practice it in our every - day association with our fellow men. ‘No degree of Masonry is of any avail, unless it bears fruit in action’.”’ 0"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"U The principles of Freemasonry are not detached statements of a number of different principles but they are all inter-related so as to form a system of moral principles. That this system may be better understood it is taught by allegories and symbols mainly built around the builder’s art and science. The ancient bu[lders believed that a divine spirit should give life to a building and human beings were sacrificed to furnish this lire. This was forbidden in the Bible and God himself said he would dwell in the temple which King Solomon built in His honor. Many men believe that when God breathed into men’s nostrils the breath of life, he became a living soul as well as a living body. Biblical emphasis is often placed upon the living soul which is to be a dwelling place for the Almighty. 1~A asonry seems to carry out these ideas in using the building of King Solomon’s Temple, which was also to be God’s dwelling place, as a fitting symbol of the spiritual temple man is to erect in his own soul. For this reason, in our modern Masonic ritual, frequent mention is made of certain events which are said to have happened at the building of King Solomon’s Temple. The Bible tells us that the Great Architect of the Universe caused His name to dwell in this Temple, between the Cherubim and on the ark of the covenant, and in the con - struction of the Temple we learn many lessons applicable to character building. Because of these lessons, legends, and allegories which illustrate some phase of character building have been ascribed to the building of this Temple. It must be evident to every th[nking Craftsman that “there is a close analogy between man’s physi - cal and spiritual needs. No sooner had the neces - sities of his physical nature impelled him to pro - vide shelter from the inclemency of the weather than the growing needs of his soul caused him to recognize the symbolical relation between his physical and spiritual development, and that the principles which govern in the construction of his material buildings also hold good in the build - ing of his spiritual temple. “It is this symbolic relationship which Free - masonry emphasizes in its mysteries and it is this emphasis which distinguishes it from other societies which teach good morals, the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. Man feels the need of a home for his soul as well as for his body and Masonry, recognizing this need, applies, in all its ceremonies and instruction, the principles of ma - terial building to that of spiritual. “This fact must be borne in mind if we would understand Masonic symbolism. The symbols which we use may have other interpretations than those 126 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR I The following general explanations indicate the broad and basic symbolism of each degree, the great lesson it seeks to convey and the sign ificance of its position in the entire Masonic system.

Hence the temple that we build is a spiritual building, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.”’ In the building or this temple we are seeking the realization of an ideal. This search for the ideal is found in some form in every Masonic ceremony. The way in which the rough ashlar be - comes perfect, the fitting ourselves as living stones for a spiritual building, the mystic ladder reaching 9 from earth to heaven, the stairs which lead to the middle chamber, the loss of the Word that makes a true Master, which future ages will bring to light the unfinished temple that is some day to be completed—all these as A. S. McBride says: “symbolize the throbbing, yearning, seeking of the human heart for something better and happier than the actual world around us. But the grand ideal in Masonry, to which all the rest are sub - sidiary and contributory, is that which represents the soul of man as a Holy Temple and dwelling place for the Most High. This ideal has, no doubt, been expressed by poets, prophets and philoso - phers, but in Masonry only has it been made the basis of an organization, having a system of instruction, as uniqoe in form as it is rare in history.” Masonic Symbolism, by Charles C. Hunt. SYMBOLISM OF THE ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE Freemasonry is an allegory or human life. The Lodge represents the world into which a man is born and in which he lives, labors, and finally lays down his working tools to embark upon his voyage to another and better world. In ancient times the earth was commonly be - lieved to be flat; and that part of the world known to man at the time of King Solomon’s Temple was, roughly, in the form of an oblong square— or, a rectangle. Hence we are told in the first degree that the form of a Lodge is oblong and its dimensions from east to west, from north to south, from the earth to the heavens and from the surface to the center—meaning that the field of Masonry includes all the earth and all human experience. The Entered Apprentice degree is intended symbolically, to represent the entrance of man into the world in which he is afterward to become a living and thinking actor. Coming from the ignorance and darkness of the outer world, his first craving is for Light. Not that physical light which springs from the great orb of day as its fountain, but that intellectual light which ema - nates from the primal source or all things, from the Great Architect of the Universe, Creator of the sun and of all things that it illuminates. The Entered Apprentice is brought from dark - ness to light; and he first discovers the three Great Lights of Masonry, which symbolize the most im - portant things in our existence as human beings created in the image of God. Throughoot the degree he is taught the basic principles of right living. II 128 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR 129 w -"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Hence the great, primary object of the first degree is to symbolize the birth of intellectual light into the mind. The Entered Apprentice is the type of unregenerate man, groping in moral and mental darkness, and seeking for the light which is to guide his steps and point him to the path which leads to duty and to Him who gives to duty its reward. Further, the first degree is intended to repre - sent, or symbolize, Youth just entering on the struggles, the trials, and the duties of an early and responsible existence. On his first admission into the Lodge, the candidate is reminded of the weak and helpless state of man when he first enters the world—unprepared for its exigencies of the present, ignorant of the vicissitudes of the future, and dependent for his safety and his very existence on that God in whom alone, in all trials and difficulties, is there any sure and abiding trust. iS As the youth is prepared for a useful and vir - tuous education for his journey through life, so the Entered Apprentice obtains those first instructions whereon to erect his future moral and Masonic edifice. He receives the elementary details of that universal language in which hereafter he is to converse with his brethren of all nations, so as to understand and be understood by Masons of every tongue and dialect under the sun. He is directed to take as a staff and script for his jour - ney, a knowledge of all the virtues that expand the heart and dignify the soul. Secrecy, obedience, humility, trust in God, purity of conscience, econ - omy of time, are all inculcated by symbolic cere - monies too impressive in their character to ever be forgotten, if he will heed them well. And lastly, as charity forms the chief corner - stone of all Masonic virtues, the beauty and holi - “Freemasonry is a many-sided subject. There is something in it which arrests and appeals to the shallowest mind or the most frivolous moral character. At the same time, there is much in it which has claimed the thought and attention of the world’s greatest intellects and wisest philoso - phers. It presents many aspects for study and investigation, either of which will amply repay the efforts of the intelligent mind and will lead to knowlodge not merely curious, as some suppose, but of the utmost practical value.” 2 Let us, therefore, examine the symbolism of the first degree from another point of view; one which supplements and expands the explanation pre - viously given. The symbolism of this degree is for the ap - prentice. An apprentice Mason is one who has begun the study of Masonry. Certain qualifications are necessary for every apprentice. The qualifica - tions of a Masonic apprentice are a belief in God, a desire for knowledge, and a sincere wish to be of service to his fellow creatures. Possessing these qualifications, the candidate must follow a course of ancient hieroglyphic moral instruction, taught agreeably to ancient usages, by types, emblems, and allegorical figures. This is symbolism, and symbolism is a universal lan - guage. It is the language in which God reveals Himself to man. 150 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR i ENTERED AP PRENTICE SYMBOLISM 181 ness of this attribute are depicted in emblematic modes which no spoken language could equal. The Entered Apprentice degree is, in short, one of probation and preparation for a more advanced position, and more exalted privileges and duties. 1 1 Adapted from the North Dakota Monitor.

Realizing that the good intentions of the candidate, his own righteousness or even the Lodge organization, are not sufficient, we invoke the blessing and aid of God upon our search for knowledge and troth. Thus we have the primal conception that the Lodge operates under direction and by order of the Supreme Architect of the Universe. The apprentice must advance on the square by regular upright steps. His work is good work, but not finished work. Thus he makes an oblong, or an imperfect, square. Obligations are ties, and also duties assumed. They are not, primarily, promises or oaths.

We"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"134 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE SYMBOLISM 115 must assume them if we would advance, and having assumed them we are bound by them whether we will or not. Then the Light breaks and we begin to see. We find that others, even the most learned, stand like the beginners. The Master is on a level with the apprentice, and extends a hand which is grasped fraternally. There before him is the key to the IViaster’s Word—an open book. God’s Holy Book, His revelation to us, is the guide in our search for Light. To the Jew, the Holy Book is the history of Israel, substantially the Old Testament. To the Christian it is the Old and the New Testament. To the Mohammedan it is the Koran; to the Hindu, the Veda. But what - ever book it is, it is the Holy Book for the seeker of Light and that which he believes to be the word of God. The Holy Book together with the and Compass are the Great Lights of * I Square onry, representing the three leading prin - ciples of the Masonic philosophy: In 1943, the Grand Lodge approved the following addition to our Preliminary instructions, “These Lodges of Operative workmen hound their members by solemn vows, and severe penalties were inflicted for violations. These penalties are still used owing to their antiquity, and to impress upon the candidate the importance and serious nature of their agree - ments, hut the only penaltes inflicted by Masonic Lodges today are (1) Reprimand. (2) Suspension. (5) Expulsion’~ There, too, before him are the Lesser Lights. Man has need of two divergent qualities of char - acter. He must have energy and initiative; he must also be tactful, resourceful, and adaptive. If he cannot break through an obstacle, he must go around it. The idea symbolized by the Lesser Lights is that he should combine these divergent qualities in carrying out the orders of the Supreme Architect. . . . The Sun, from ancient times, has always been a symbol of the masculine quality, energy and force; the Moon, of the feminine quality, adaptability and tact. To be energetic at the right time and to compromise at the right time is to be a Master. The Master is symbolical of the offspring of the great Active and Passive Principles. He is the mediator, the child of the two great forces. He sets the Craft to work upon their symbolic studies, which is no light responsi - bility to be assumed by the uninformed. Only chaos and disaster can overtake him who at - tempts the work he is not qualified to perform. Then, as before, the candidate must follow the course of the sun. The seeker after Light always emerges from the North in the East and passes by way of the South to the West and again into darkness, with full faith and perfect confidence that day will follow night. He is continually subjected to tests and trials and always held re - sponsible for what he has learned and for that which has gone before. All that Masonry stands for is summed up in these symbols. Hence they are called the Three Great Lights. The ceremony which attends presentation of “the badge of a Mason” speaks for itself. The Apron was not only a practical article used by a. That there is an Architect whose eye is All- Seeing. b. That He gives directions to the Crart (sym - bolized by the Sacred Book). c. That man’s conscience and will are given him to enable him to know and obey these directions (symbolized by the Compass). d.

Education and achievement call for con - stant effort. The exercise of his faculties requires man to be ever climbing upward step by step. “The development of people is the central objective of Nature.” Development requires the expenditure of energy. There are three reasons why the stairs are winding: (a) Advancement in knowledge is spiral. In ac - quiring skill or mastering a problem, one keeps turning the subject in his mind, and as he does he gradually sees it more clearly until he gets above it and looks down upon it, comprehends and grasps it Nature, whose laws are a manlfestation of God’s pur - pose, builds freely with spirals. j~ (b) It is common experience that very often what we achieve is not what we set out to ac - complish. Man strives with a particular end in view and finds that the result is not at all what he expected. Some of our greatest scien - tific discoveries (X-rays, vulcanizing of rub - ber, dynamite, etc., for example) were the result of researches of men who were seeking for something else. FELLOW CRAFT SYMBOLISM 141 The steps of the winding stairs are symbolic too, as elaborated in the lecture. The Lodge and its three principal officers are symbolic of the world and civilized society. In climbing the stairs of life we are dependent on the assistance of other men. We should, therefore, reciprocate by giving them assistance. Our labors should tend to advance society. We are to work for the good of mankind, not for ourselves alone. The five senses of human nature are symbolic of the faculties we use in climbing the stairs. The first three—hearing, seeing, and feeling—are parti - cularly essential because they are those most neces - sary to our intellectual and moral development. The grand divisions of knowledge, which con - stitute the application man makes of his faculties, are seven, as enumerated. At the time the ritual was written it was supposed that the “seven liberal arts and sciences” constituted universal knowledge; and the second section lecture was included to provide Masons with learning which they could not readily obtain elsewhere, for there were no public schools in England, or anywhere else, at that time. The lecture in its present form is much abridged. It serves only a symbolic pur - pose today, suggesting the dignity and importance of knowledge. It is, at the same time, a profound pronouncement of some of the basic laws which govern the universe. A workman’s prime qualification is accuracy, clearness of comprehension. Though ninety-nine per cent of his work be perfect, yet, if he fails in the remaining one per cent, his failure may be complete. The true Fellow Craft must not only learn, he must thoroughly learn. He must not guess, he must know—he must be accurate. Ir ‘I (c) Man climbs the stairs but what he believes to be his goal may be only an illusion. The end and purpose of his striving is not for hlm to decide, but rather for the Supreme Architect. The future is never straight up or straight ahead, but always partially hidden from our view. God knows what He would have done. The workman’s duty is to work toward the fulfillment of His plan."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"142 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR MASTER MASON SYMBOLISM 145 The habit of relying on superficial knowledge is all too common. Many think that knowledge and skill are a mere trick, the result of a magic formula that can be passed along or bought for a fee. Many also jump at conclusions, fail to observe, listen inattentively, assume an understanding when they have it not, and are satisfied with giving an impression of knowledge. Thus they sow the seeds of their own failure. They are the Ephraimites of life. They have not the Pass!— And it is significant that the Craftsman does not comprehend the Pass until he has climbed the Winding Stairs; namely, until he has gained an understanding of the need of accuracy from actual experience. The Pass is a preliminary qualification (outer door) ; the Word, the final qualification (inner door). Stability imports more than strength. It means persistence of strength, the capacity to endure, to withstand wear and tear, to function in use. The Word is the complement of the Pass. Only he who has both enters the Middle Chamber to become a Master Craftsman. The word Geometry is derived from the Greek words Ge (earth or world) and Metrein (to mea - sure), and literally means the science of measur - ing and analyzing the universe. Masonically speak - ing, Geometry comprehends all science, art, and philosophy, all skill and learning. All knowledge, in the last analysis, can be defined as an under - standing of the world in which we live, its laws and forces, and of the living beings which inhabit it. Thomas Huxley said: “Education is the in - struction of the intellect in the laws of Nature, and the acquisition of the ability to conform to those laws.” All discoveries of science demonstrate that the natural world is no haphazard collection of things and forces, but a system and a design governed by universal laws. All living things can be classi - fied by tribes or species. Every animal has a bal - anced and proportioned struct ore, and functions by rule. Every plant and tree grows in geometric pattern. Fabre, the great French scientist, says: “Geom - etry, that is to say, the science of harmony in space, presides over everything. We find it in the arrangement of a fir-cone, as it is in the arrange - ment of an Eperia’s living web; we find it in the spiral of a snail’s shell, in the chaplet of a spider’s thread, and in the orbit of a planet; it is everywhere as perfect in the world of atoms, as in the world of immensities. And this universal geometry tells us of a Universal Geometrician whose divine compass has measured all things.~~ Geometry is particularly essential to Masons because a study of it leads to the conviction that behind such a universe there must be a Supreme Intelligence, an Architect who has planned and designed it, for and under whom we work, and from whom we receive our Wages.” SYMBOLISM OF THE MASTER MASON DEGREE If the first degree is intended as a representa - tion of youth, and the second of manhood, the third degree is emblematic of old age, with its trials, its sufferings, and its final termination in death. This, and much of the material in Part III, has been adapted from “Manual for use in Lodges of Instruction,” pubiished by the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, A F & A. M. S a"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"P 144 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR The time for toiling is now over, the opportunity to learn has now passed away; the spiritual temple that we have all been striving to erect in our hearts is now nearly completed, and the wearied workman awaits only the word of the Grand Master of the Universe to call him from the labors of earth to the eternal refreshment of heaven. Hence, this is by far the most solemn and im - pressive of the de~rees of Masonry; and it has, in consequence of the profound truths which it inculcates, been distinguished by the Craft as the Sublime degree. As an Entered Apprentice, the Mason is taught those elementary instructions which were to fit him f or advancement in his profession, just as the youth is supplied with that rudimentary edu - cation which is to prepare him for entering upon the active duties of life. As a Fellow Craft, the Mason is directed to continue his investigations q in the science of the institution, and to labor diligently in the tasks it prescribes, just as the man is required to enlarge his mind by the acquisi - tion of new ideas, and to extend his usefulness to his fellow-creatures. But as a Master, the Mason is taught the last, the most important and most necessary of truths, that having been faithful to all his trust, he is at last to die, and to receive the rewards of his fidelity. This is the scope and aim of its ritual. The Master Mason represents man, when youth, manhood, old age, and life itself have passed away as fleeting shadows, yet raised from the grave of iniquity, and quickened into another and better existence. By its legend and all its ritual, it is implied that we have been redeemed from the death of sin and the sepulchre of pollution. “The ceremonies and the lecture,” as a distinguished writer has observed, “beautifully illustrate this all-engros - sing subject; and the conclusion we arrive at is, that youth, properly ditected, leads us to the honorable and virtuous maturity, and that the life of man, regulated by morality, faith, and justice, will be rewarded at its closing hour by the prospect of eternal bliss. “Many of the symbols of the Master Mason degree are common to the preceeding degrees. There is, however, discoverable in their use, as the degrees progress, an increasing seri - ousness and depth of meaning. “For instance, in the first two degrees, the Lodge symbolizes the world, the place where all workman labor at useful avocations and in the acquisition of human knowledge and virtue. But in the Master’s degree it represents the Sanctum Sanctorum, or Holy of Holies of King Solomon’s Temple, which was itself a symbol of Heaven, or the abode of Deity. It was there that nothing earthly or unclean was allowed to enter; it was there that the visible presence of the Deity was said to dwell between the Cherubim. In the Master’s Lodge, therefore, we are symbolically brought into the awful presence of the Deity. The reference here to death and the future life is obvious and is a further evidence that this degree typifies old age and death. MASTER MASON SYMBOLISM 145 It was the single object of all the ancient rites and mysteries practiced in the very bosom of pagan darkness, shining as a solitary beacon in all that surrounding gloom, and cheering the philosopher in his weary pilgrimage of life, to teach the immortality of the soul. This is still the great design of the third degree of Masonry."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"146 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR MASTER MASON SYMBOLISM 147 “But there is even a deeper symbolism in the Master’s lodge. The allusion is not only to the sacred chamber of Solomon’s physical temple, it alludes also to the sacred chamber of that spiritual temple we all are, or should be, namely, a pure heart, and admonishes us to make of it a place fit for Deity Himself to dwell. . “In the Entered Apprentice and Fellow Craft degrees, Light typifies the acquisition of human knowledge and virtue; in the Master Mason degree it typifies the revelation of divine truth in the life that is to come. “In the first two degrees the Square and Com - pass denote the earth and inculcate and impress upon us the desirability of curbing our passion; in the Third degree the Compass symbolizes what is heavenly, because to our ancient brethren the heavens bore the aspect of circles and arches, ihU geometrical figures produced with the Compass. “In ancient symbolism the Square signified the earth, while the circle, a figure produced with the Compass, signified the sun or the heavens. The Square therefore symbolized what is earthly and material while the Compass signified the heavenly and spiritual.” 12 The symbolism of the position of the Compass points in each degree is therefore enlarged, and culminates in the Master Mason degree where they signify “that in the true Master, the spiritual has obtained full mastery and control over the earthly and material.”’ 3 concerned with moral principles and exhortations, as is the First degree, or with architecture and learning, as is the Second, it answers the cry of Job, ‘If a man die, shall he live again?’ “The degree delves into the deepest recesses of a man’s nature. While it leads the initiate into the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple, it probes into the Holy of Holies of his heart. “As a whole, the degree is symbolical of that old age by the wisdom of which ‘we may enjoy the happy reflections consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality.’ “But it is much more than that. It is at once the universal and yearning question of man throughout all ages, and its answer. It teaches no creed, no dogma, no religion; only that there is a hope of immortality; there is a Great Archi - tect by whose mercy we may live again; leaving to each brother his choice of interpretations by which he may read the Great Beyond. “It teaches of the power—and the powerlessness —of evil. For those who are happy in a belief in the resurrection of the physical body, the Sublime degree has comfort. For those whose hope is in the rising only of that spiritual body of which Paul taught, the degree assures of all the longing heart can wish. “When the lesson of the greatest hope and the dearest wish of all mankind is made manifest the Sublime degree turns to this life and this brotherhood, and in the symbolism of the Lion, the exposition of the Five Points of Fellowship, the means by which a Mason may claim all that a man may have from his brother, and the Word, ties together the Hiramic Legend and daily living in a manner which no thoughtful man may see If I In its legend of the Craft “the Sublime Degree departs utterly horn the familiar.

It is the story of the resur - rection of that ‘which bears the nearest affinity to that supreme intelligence which pervades all nature’. It is the answer to Job. It is at once the beginning of the even more sacred legend—of that which was lost—and the assurance that at long last he who seeks shall find “The Hiramic Legend is the glory of Free - masonry; the search f or that which was lost is the glory of life. “Never may we find it here. You shall gaze through microscope and telescope and catch no sight of its shadow. You shall travel in many lands and far, and see it not. You shall listen to all the words of all the tongues which all men have ever spoken and will speak—the Lost Word is not heard. Were it but a word, how easy it would be to invent another! But it is not a word, but The Word, the great secret, the unknowable- ness, the will o’ the wisp to follow, a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Never here is it to be found, but the search for it is the reason for life. “The Sublime Degree teaches that in another life it may be found. “That is why it is the Sublime Degree.”’ 5 RECEPTION OF GRAND MASTER When the Most Worshipful Grand Master visits a Lodge, he must be received with the greatest respect and with suitable ceremony.

The Worshipful Master should inform the Lodge that a distinguished guest is in waiting, appoint a Reception Committee and direct such committee and the Senior Deacon to retire and escort the distinguished guest into the Lodge.

The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of the Ancient and Honorable Fra - ternity of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Indiana is the sovereign IViasonic authority to which every Indiana Lodge and every member owes allegiance. It is composed of its officers, permanent members, and the representatives of the regularly chartered Lodges working under its authority. The Grand Master, who is elected at each stated meeting of the Grand Lodge (usually annually), is clothed with almost absolute Masonic power; and is therefore much more than the mere pre. siding officer of an organization. He is the Grand Master of Masons in his jurisdiction, possessing all the powers and prerogatives conferred upon the occupant of that office by the landmarks, usages, and laws of Freemasonry. The Deputy Grand Master, Senior and Junior Grand Wardens, Grand Secretary, Grand Treas - urer, and a Grand Trustee are also elected at each stated meeting of the Grand Lodge. Other Grand Officers and committee members are appointed by the Grand Master. A chartered Lodge is a body of Masons con - gregating and working by virtue of a charter granted by the Grand Lodge. A Lodge under dis - pensation is a body of Masons congregating and exercising certain limited functions by the author - ity of a dispensation granted by the Grand Master, or sometimes the Grand Lodge. RECORDED CONSTITUTION AND LAWS Inasmuch as the written constitution and laws of each Grand Lodge are in print and the by-laws of every Lodge may be consulted by its members, information on this subject may be obtained with comparatively little effort. (See Indiana “Blue Book” of General Regulations.) Rules, resolutions, and edicts, having the force of la’ws, whether adopted by the Grand Lodge or issued by the Grand Master, may be found in the printed proceedings of the Grand Lodge; and they remain in effect until repealed or withdrawn. An example of a resolution having the force of law, and whlch also embodies sound Masonic doctrine, may be found in the following declara - tion of fundamental principles, adopted by the Grand Lodge of Colorado in 1921: “1. The government of the Grand Ledge is neither a monarchy, an oligarchy, nor a ‘pure democracy.’ It is a representative constitutional republic. Every attempt to graft upon it any of the distinguishing characteristics of the first three forms named is forbidden by the injunction against innovations upon the body of Masonry’ “2. The Grand Lodge, which is hut the entire hody of the Craft in the jurisdiction, acting through its duly chosen epresentatives, and restricted only by the landmarks, has the sole power and authority to determine what is and what is not ‘Masonic,’ and to fix the conditions under which a petitioner may enter Freemasonry, or, having entered, remain. Its only guide is its best judgment as to what is oquired by the goed of the Craft and from its decision there is no appeal. “I.

Subject to discipline by the Grand Lodge for abuse of his power, the Master is the supreme authority in the Lodge. As he is responsible to the Grand Lodge, that is to the entire Fraternity, f or the manner in which his Lodge is governed, it is his duty to declare out of order and to refuse to put any motion which, if carried, would violate any law, rule, regulation, edict, or order of the Grand Lodge or Grand Master, or any principle of Masonry; and the question of whether it would do so must be determined by the Master alone. Consequently, parliamentary rules, while useful guides, are not binding upon the Master; and no appeal to the Lodge from his decision is permitted, although an appeal may be made to the Grand Master or the Grand Lodge. When a discussion is under way in the Lodge, the Master may ter - minate it at his pleasure; and he may also parti - cipate in debate without leaving the chair, in fact Masonic usage requires that he shall not vacate 0 MASONIC GOVERNMENT 157 his station on such occasion, it being his duty to give the Craft proper instruction for their labor. The training a man receives in Masonry before he arrives at the Master’s chair tends to make him conservative and inclined to respect the rights of his brethren. In all likelihood, long before he is called upon to preside over the Lodge, the influence of Masonry has created in him the will to follow the admonition expressed in the charge, that his duty to his neighbor requires him to act upon the square, to do unto others as he would have others do unto him, and to treat his brethren with the courtesy, kindness, and consideration due to the members of one family. Then, too, in the Lodge the members themselves, actuated by the spirit of Masonry, treat one another as brethren; and have no disposition to say or do anything that would wound a brother’s feelings or cause him to lose in the slightest degree his self-respect. In discussions in the Lodge the use of ill-natured ridicule, sarcasm, or irony, is as much out of place as it is in the family circle; and calmness, moderation, and kindness dis - tInguish the meetings of a Masonic body. In no other society is so much consideration evtended to the minority; and so anxious are Masons to preserve harmony that frequently a majority of the members who favor a measure brought before the Lodge will refrain from adopt - ing it simply because of their feeling that unanim - ity should prevail. It is the observance of these and other general rules of conduct, most of them unwritten, prompted by the brotherly love that is inspired by the spirit of Masonry, that for centuries has made the Masonic Lodge a most delightful fraternal home,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"158 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR GENERAL INFORMATION 159 where men of all ranks and classes, seeking relief from the strife and turmoil of life, and leaving their worldly distinctions outside the tiled door, may meet and dwell in peace and harmony upon that common Masonic le~rel where even the most humble will receive the consideration due him as a man and Mason. (Adapted from “The Plan,” by William W. Cooper.) GAINING ENTRANCE INTO A LODGE AFTER IT IS OPEN When members or visitors arrive after Lodge is opened and desire admission, the Tyler gives the alarm. When the J.D. has opened the door, he reports: “A Brother (or Brothers) (or Visitors) properly clothed and vouched for, desire admis - sion.” The J.D’s. report to the Master should be in the same words. At times the Tyler may have to report, “A visitor for whom I cannot vouch.” In such cases he gives the name and address, previously ascer - tamed. This is reported to the Lodge. Any Brother who believes he can vouch for the visitor should retire and make sure, outside, that it is the Brother he knows, and not another of the same name. Do not vouch without seeing. Then escort the visitor inside and introduce him. If no one can vouch for the visitor, the Master appoints a Committee to examine him; and they retire. (See “Reception of Visitors,” page 47). DIGNITY AND DECORUM When the Brethren assemble, prior to opening Lodge, friendly intercourse and social enjoyment are entirely proper. Boisterous and unseemly or undignified conduct is to be avoided. After Lodge has been convened by the Master, dignity and perfect decorum must prevail. No levity or de - parture from manly dignity and the strictest rules of decorum is admissible in any circumstances. Only proper officers should enter the room where candidates are being prepared for initiation. The utmost decorum should prevail at that time, that the candidate may be thoroughly imbued with the solemnity and importance of the step he is ~bout to take. Joking the candidate is a repre - hensible Masonic offense and is absolutely pro - hibited. SIGNS Every Mason is carefully taught the proper signs in each degree. Every one entering a Lodge can learn from the Tyler, in advance, or learn for himself by observation, the degree in which the Lodge is open. It is highly important that care in this matter be exercised by all members. Signs should be given with precision. WEARING YOUR APRON The Apron must be worn where it may be seen— OUTSIDE of all clothing in public ceremonies or funerals; but in the Lodge Room it may be worn either over or under the coat provided only that it may be seen. This applies equally to the uniforms of the Armed Forces of the U. S. A. (General Regulations)."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"-‘I 160 INDIANA MASONIC MONITOR COLLATERAL AND NON-MASONIC BODIES “All Freemasonry is based on the Lodge. From the Lodge one may join other Masonic groups. Freemasonry officially recognizes as Masonic bodies: Chapters of Royal Arch Masons, Councils of Royal and Select Masters, Commanderies of Knights Templar, and the several bodies of the F Scottish Rite with its elaborate system of thirty- three degrees. These are sometimes called ‘higher degrees.’ They are higher only in the sense that they have higher numbers and that some of them are prerequisite for others. The man who has received the three degrees in the Lodge is a Master Mason. There is nothing higher and noth - ing superior to him in Masonry. “There are certain other organizations, the best known of which are perhaps the Shrine and the Grotto, which are not Masonic organizations but organizations of Masons. That is to say, they draw their membership from the Masonic Fra - ternity, but they are not a part of it.” (The Masonic Fraternity, by Frederick W. Hamilton). MASONIC CALENDAR—RULES FOR MASONIC DATES Freemasons, in affixing dates to their official documents, have a calendar peculiar to themselves, differing according to various Rites. ANCIENT CRAFT MASONS commence their era the creation of the world, calling it Anno with ucis (A.L.), “in the year of light”; not be - cause they believe Freemasonry to be coeval with r MASONIC CALENDAR 161 creation, but because of its symbolic reference to the Light of Masonry. Lodges F. & A. M. in Indiana hold Meetings. — Add 4000 to the current year. ROYAL ARCH MASONS date from the year the second temple was commenced by Zerubbabel, Anno Invention is (A.I.), “in the year of dis - covery.” Chapters R.A.M. hold Convocations. — Add 530 to the current year. ROYAL AND SELECT MASTERS date from the year in which the Temple of Solomon was completed, Anno Depositionis (A. Dep.), “in the year of deposit.” Councils R. & S. M. hold Assemblies. — Add 1000 to the current year. KNIGHTS TEMPLAR commence their era with the organization of their Order, Anno Ordinis (A.O.), “in the year of their Order.” Commanderies K.T. hold Conclaves. — Subtract 1118 from the current year. THE ORDER OF HIGH PRIESTHOOD dates from the year of the blessing of Abraham by the High Priest 114 elchisedek, Anno Benedictionis, (A.B.), “in the year of the blessing.” Councils of Anointed High Priests hold Convocations. — Add 1918 to the current year. THE ANCIENT ACCEPTED SCOTTISH RITE uses the Hebrew chronology. Add 3760 to the current year. For example, 1946 plus 3760 equals 5706 A.M. (Anno Mundi—in the year of the World).

The following was written by Brother Dr. Joseph Fort Newton, as the clossng paragraph of his widely read book “The Builders.” It bids fcvzr to become a Masonic classic. “When is a man a Mason? When he can bob out over the rivers, the hills, and the far horizon with a profound sense of his own littleness in the vast scheme of things, and yet have faith, hope, and courage—which is the root of every virtue. When he knows that down in his heart every man is as noble, as vile, as divine, as diabolic, and as lonely a~s himself, and seeks to know, to forgive, and to love his fellow man. When he knows how to sympathize with men in their sorrows, yea, even in their sins—knowing that each man fights a hard fight against many odds. When he has learned how to make friends and to keep them, and above all how to keep friends with himself. When he loves flowers, can hunt the birds without a gun, and feels the thrill of an old forgotten joy when he hears the laugh of a little child. When he can be happy and high- minded amid the meaner drudgeries of life. When star-crowned trees, and the glint of sunlight on flowing waters, subdue him like the thought of one much loved and long dead. When no voice of distress reaches his ears in vain, and no hand seeks his~ aid without response. When he finds good in every faith that helps any man lay hold of divine things and sees majestic meanings in life, whatever the name of that faith may be. When he can look into a wayside puddle and see something beyond mud, and into the face of the most forlorn fellow mortal and see something beyond sin. When he knows how to pray, how to love, how to hope. When he has kept faith with himself, with his fellow man, with his God; in his hand a sword for evil, in his heart a bit of a song—glad to live, but not afraid to die! Such a man has found the only real secret of Masonry, and the one which it is trying to give to all the world.”"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"E GLOSSARY AND PRONUNCIATION Explanations of uncommon words, Masonic terms and proper names.
