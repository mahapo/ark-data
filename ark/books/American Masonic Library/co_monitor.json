Our first care is directed to the external ave - nues of the Lodge, and the proper officers whose province it is to discharge that duty, execute the trust with fidelity By certain mystic forms, of no recent date, it is intimated that we may safely proceed To detect impostors among ourselves, an adherence to order in the character of Masons en - sues, and the Lodge is opened or closed in solemn form. At opening the Lodge two purposes are effected: the Master is reminded of the dignity of his char - acter, and the brethren of the homage and ven - eration due from them in their sundry stations These are not the only advantages resulting from a due observance of the ceremony, a reverential awe for the Deity is inculcated, and the eye fixed on that object from whose radiant beams light only can be derived Hence in this ceremony we are taught to adore God, and supplicate his protection on our well-meant endeavors The Master assumes his government in due form, and under him his wardens, who accept their trust after the custom - ary salutations Then the brethren with one accord unite in duty and respect, and the ceremony concludes At closing the Lodge a similar form takes place Here the less important duties of Masonry are not passed over unobserved The necessiry degree of subordination which takes place in the government of the Lodge is peculiarly marked, while the proper tribute of gratitude is offered up to the benefi - cent Author of Die, whose blessing is invoked and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"10 COLORADO CRAF VSM AS 11 OPENING AND CLOSING vw.stichtingargus. ni] ?vw.stichtingargus. ni vw. stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni ?vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus.nl ~vw.stichtingargus.n1 ~vw. stichtingargus. ni ww.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni ww.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus. ni vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stiehtingargus.nl vw.sticht ingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl iw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargusnl wstichti ngargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI extended to the whole fraternity Each brother then faithfully locks up the treasure which he has acquired in his own repository, and pleased with his reward, retires to enjoy, and disseminate among the private circle of his friends, the fruits of his labor and industry in the Lodge These are faint outlines of a ceremony which universally prevails among Masons, and distin - guishes all their meetings —William Preston PRAYER AT OPENING And now may we have wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn, all our laudable undertakings, May all our thoughts, words, and actions be in accordance with our professions as Masons.

Lodges at the present day are usually held in upper chambers, prob - ably for the better security such places afford FoaM. A Lodge is said, symbolically, to extend in length from east to west; in breadth, from north K ENTERED APPRENT] CE to south, in height, from the earth to tbe highest heaven; in depth, from the surface to the center. And a Lodge is said to be of these vast dimen - sions to denote the universality of Masonry, and to teach us that a Mason’s charity should he equally extensive.

Our ancient brethren dedi - cated their Lodges to King Solomon, because he was our first Most Worshipful Grand Master; but modern Masons dedicate theirs to St John the Baptist and St. John the Evan - gel ist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time there is represented, in every regular and well-gov - erned Lodge, a certain point within a circle, embordered by two perpendic - ular parallel lines, representing St John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist; and upon the top rest the Holy Scriptures. The point epresents an individual brother, the circle is the boundary line, beyond which he is never to suffer his prejudices or passions to betray him In going round this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines as well as upon the Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within these due bounds, it is impossible that he should materially err TENETS The three great tenets of a Mason’s profession are Brotherly Love, Reliet, and Ti-uth mtoTI{EiiLY LOVE By the exercise of brotherly love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one faniily, the high and low, the rich and poor, who, being created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, sup - port, and protect each other On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF. To relieve the distressed, is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with them in their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections TRUTH.

It furnishes us with dwellings, and with convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary, and beneficent purposes. SPECULATiVE MASONRY. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain seci-ecy, and practice charity.

FELLOW CRAFT 45 The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the five orders The simplicity of the construc - tion of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous. The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and is the best proportioned of all the orders, the several parts of which it is com - posed being founded on the natural position of solid bodies The Ionic displays both delicacy and inge - nuity in its construction, and bears a kind of mean proportion between the moi-e solid and the more delicate orders. The Corinthian, the richest of the I~lve orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art, and is used in stately and superb structures The Composite is compounded of the other ordei-s, and is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. Of these five orders of architecture, the Ionic, Doric, and Coiinthian, as the most ancient, are the most revered by Tvlasons. * * TuE FIVE SENSES OF HUMAN NATURE Hearing is that sense by which we disti~ - guish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music.

Behavior After the Lodge is Over and the Brethren Not Gone, You may enjoyyourselves with innocent mirth, treating one another accoFding to ability, but avoiding all excess, or forcing any brother to eat or drink beyond his inclination, or hindering him from going when his occasions call him, or doing or saying anything oFfensive, or that may forbid an easy and tree conversation, for that would blast our harmony and defeat our laud - able purposes.
