These pillars are represented in the Lodge by the Worshipful Master, and the Senior and Junior Wardens. The Covering of a Lodge is no less than the clouded Canopy or star-decked heaven where all good Masons hope at last to arrive by the aid of that theological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw, reaching from earth to heaven—the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, t{ope wnd Charity, which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity for all mankind.

The 0 narneats of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blaz - ing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a repre - sentation of the ground floor of King Solo - mon’s Temple, and is emblematic of human life, checlcered with good and evil. The In - dented Tessel is a representation of the beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded the pavement, and is emblematic of the manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a faithfrd reliance upon Divine Providence, hieroglyphically tepresented by the Blazing Star in the center. The Ucghts of a Lodge are three, situated in the East, West and South. As you may obseive, there is none in the North, because King Solomon~s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was situated so far north of the ecliptic that neither the sun nor the moon, at meridian height could dart its i-ays into the north part of the building The North, therefore, among Masons, has always been termed a place of darkness. The Jewels of a Lodge are six, three im - The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ash - lar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle- Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and na - tural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adjusted by the working-tools of the fellowcraft. The Trestle-Board is for the master worliman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar of that state of perfec - tion at which we hope to arrive by a virtu - aus education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God; and by the Ti-estle-Board we are reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agree - ably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle-Board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to ei-ect oUr spis-itual building agieeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Sc- I5IRST DEGRRt~ tiovable and three movable.

Lodges are situated due east aid west because Moses, after having been instru - mental in conducting the children of Israel through the Red Sea when pursued by Pharoah and his hosts, by Divine command erected a tabernacle which he placed due east and west, to commemorate the mighty cast wind by which their miraculous deliv - erance was wrought. This tabernacle was an exact’model for King Solomon~s Temple, for which reason all Masonic Lodges are, or should be, situated due east and west. Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solomon, as it is said that he was orir first Most Excellent Grand lVlaster. Lodges at the present time are dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Freema - sonry, and since their time there is, or should be, represented in every well furn - ished Lodge a certain point within a circle —the point rep resenting an individual broths er, and the circle, the boundary line of his conduct, beyond which he should never suf - fer his passions, his prejudices, or his inter - ests to beti-ay him. This circle is supported by two perpendiculas parallel lines, ~epie- senting- Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, and on its top rest the — il — L. I loly Writings. In traversing its circum - Icrence we necessarily touch upon the par - edlel lines, and also upon the Holy Bible; sind while a Mason keeps himself thus cir - cumscribed, it is impossible that he can materially err. The three principal tenets of Freemason - iy are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. BROTHERLY LOVE By the exercise of Brotherly Love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family,—the high and the low, the rich and the poor,—who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and pro - tect each other. On this principle Freema - sonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and causes true friendship to exist among those who might otherwise have re - mained at a perpetual distance, RBLIEF To relieve the distressed is a duty incum - bent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked togethes~ by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfor - tunes, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendship, and establish our connections.

When the rigor of seasons first obliged men to conti-ive shelter from th~ inclemency of the weather we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands which connected these trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, and from this simple hint orig - inally proceeded the more improved art of aichitecture. The five Orders are thus classified: The Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Com - posite. or THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE The ancient and oi-mginal orders of archi - tectul-e, esteemed by Masons, are no more than the three—the Done, Ionic and Corin - thIan—which were invented by the Greeks, To these the Romans added two: The Tus - can, which they made plainer than the Dorw, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Coi-inthman. The first three orders, alone, however, show invention and particular SECOND DECREE character, and essentially diffem- from each other, the two others having nothing bul what is borrowed, and differing only inci - dentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Corinthian enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, are we indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. * I * ~ * THE FIVE SENSES OF HUMAN NATURE Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. -I- -I- * * * THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS ANI) SCIENCES Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy~ *1*1* Gi-~mmar is the science which teaches us to express our ideas in appropriate words, which we afterwards beautify and adorn by means of rhetoric, while logic instructs us how to think and reason with propriety, and makes language subordinate to thought.

EXPLANATION THE FIVE ORDERS OF ARCHITECTURE The TUSCAN is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tus - SECOND DEGREE cany, whence it derived its Dame. Its col - uma is seven diameters high; and its capi - tal, base, and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the construc - tion of this column renders it eligible when ornament would be supeifluous. The DORIC, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, ercept moulding-s—though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The solid composition of this ordel gives it pi-efei-ence in structures where strength and noble simplicity are chiefly re - quired. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the oi-ders. In its first invention it was more simple than in its present state In after times, when it began to be adorned, it gained the nanie of Doric; for when it was constructed in its pi-imitive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence, the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its i-esemblance to that pillar in its original state. The IONIC beai-s a mean proportion be - tween the more solid and the more delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high, Its capital is adoineci with volutes, and its toemmice has deimtals.

It is said to have been formed after tire model of an agreeable young woman, of elegant shape, dressed in her hair—as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man. The CORINTHIAN, the richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leases and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentals and modillions. This order is used in stately and superb sti-uc - tum-es. It was invented at Corinth, by Calli - machus, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the follow - ing remarkable circumstances: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys, covered with a tile, placed over an acanthus root, having been left there, by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encompassed the basket, till, arriving at the tile, they met with an ob - struction and bent downwards. Callimachus, sti-uck witlj.~-’the object, set about imitating the figure, the base of the capital he made to represent the basket, the abacus the tile, and the volutes the bending leaves. The COMPOSITE is compounded of the oth - SECOND DECREE er orders, and was contrived by the Ro - mans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has the quarter-round as the Tuscan and the Doric order, is ten diam - eters high, and its cornice has dentals or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. THE FIVE SENSES OF HUMAN NATURE HEARING is that sense by which we dis - tinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoy - ing all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires; while thus oul- reason is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most impom-tant part of our knowledge by the information of others. For these purposes we are endowed with hearing, that, by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete.

By this sense we find our way in the path - less ocean, traverse the globe of eam-th, detem- - mine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of [t. By it we meas - ure the planetary orbs and make new dis - coveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more, by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections, of oul- fellow ci-~atures, when they wish most to conceal them, so that though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which administer to this sense are the most astonishing parts of the animated cre - ation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye, and its app ortenances, evince the admirable con - trivance of nature, for performing all its various external and internal motions; while the variety displayed in the eyes of differ - ent animals, suited to their several ways of life, cle~yJy demonstrates this organ to be the masterpiece of nature’s work. FEELING is thal sense by which we dis - tinguish the different qualities of bodies such as heat and cold, hardness and soft - ness, roughness and smoothness, figure, sol - idity, motion, and extension. — 38 — U SECOND DEGREE SMELLING is that sense by which we dis - tinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and, indeed, most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of vast sub - tlety, as well in the state of life and growth as in the state of fermentation and putre - faction. These effluvia, being drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all bodies are smelled. Hence, it is evident that there is a manifest appear - ance of design in the Great Creator’s having planted the organ of small in the inside of that canal, through which the air continually passes in respiration. TASTING enables us to make a proper dis - tinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs it is plain that they were intended by nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting, and by it we are capable of dis - cerning the change which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. — 39 — -- ~777~~ - ~It"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.~tichtingargus.n1 vw.stichtingargus.nl ~‘w. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl ~v. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl ~vv. stichtingargus.nl - ,‘w.stichtingargus.nl I ixv.stichtingargus.nl rw. sticht ingargus.nl 1W. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nI) rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl TW. stichtingargus.nl rW. stichtingargus.nl SW.Stichtingargus.nl SW.Stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtmgargus.nI SW. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I I SECOND DEGREE THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIE I~CES GRAMMAR teaches the proper arrangement of words, according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people; and that excellency of pronunciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agree - ably to reason and correct usage. RHETORIC teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any subject not merely with propi-iety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance; wisely contriving to captivate the hearer by strength of argu - ment and beauty of expression, whether it be tb entreat and exhort, to admonish or applaud. LOGIC teaches us to guide our i-eason dis - cretionally in the general knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after truth. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we mnfei, deduce, and conclude, ac - cording to certain premises laid down, ad - mitted or granted, and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reason - ing, and disposing, all of which ai-e natur - ally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question is finally deter - mined. ARITHMETIC teaches the powers and prop - erties of numbers, which are variously effected, by letters, tables, figures, and in - struments. By this art, reasons and demon- — 40 — SECOND DEGREE strations are given for finding out any cer - tain number whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. GEOMETRY—(FO1~ explanation see page 30.) MUSIC teaches the art of forming con - cords, so as to compose delightful harmony by a mathematical and proportional ar - rangement of acute, grave, and mixed sounds. This art, by a series of experiments, is reduced to a demonstrative science with respect to tones and the intervals of sound. It inquires into the nature of concords and discords, and enables us to find out the pro - poition between them by numbers. ASTRONOMY is that divine art by which we are taught to read the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the Almighty Creator in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere. Assisted by Astronomy we can observe the motions, measure the distances, comprehend the magnitudes, and calculate the periods and eclipses of the heavenly bodies. By it we learn the use of the globe, the system of the world, and the preliminary law of na - ture. While we are employed in the study of this science, we must perceive unparallel - ed instances of wisdom and goodness, and through the whole creation, trace the Glor - ous Author by H~s worlis. —41— 4 K"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"~rw.stichtingargus.n1 y-w. stichtingargus.nl i,rw.stichtingargus.nl ~rw.stichtingargus.n1 ~rw.sti chtingargus.nl i,rw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl i,rw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus .nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl i,rw.stichtingargus.nl ~rw. stichtingargus.nl i{w. sti chtingargus.nl v~w, stichtingargus.nl ~w.sticIitmgargus.nl ~‘w. stichtingargus.nl ~xv. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl ~vv. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl [xv. stichtingargus.nl TW. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtrngargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nI rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus .nl rW.stichtjngargus.nl rW.stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingargus.nI SW. stichtingargus.nI SW. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I 1 THIRD DEGREE *~ * * * * ~‘ “Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, * “Nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not dark - ened, nor the clouds return after the rain. * “In the days when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves; ** “And the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out the windows be darkened; - * ~ “And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought ow. * * “Also, when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way; *** “And the almond tree ~hall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail. * * * “Because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets; or ever the silver cord be — 43 —"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus .nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl ~‘wa~tichtingargus.nl ~‘w.stichtingargus.nl ~‘w. stichtingargus.nl ~xv. stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl ~vv. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl ~‘w. stichtingargus.nl ~‘v. stichtingargus.nl TW. stichtingargus.nl 1W.stichtrngargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nI rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus .nl rW.stichtingargus.nl rW.stichtingargus.nl SW. stichtingargus.nI SW. stichtingargus.nI SW. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I Is an instrument made use of by Opera - tive Masons to spread the cement which unites the building into one common mass - but we, as Ancient Free and Accepted Ma - sons, are taught to mal~e use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of spread. ing the cement of brotherly love and affec - tion—that cement which unites us into one sacred band, oi- society of friends and broth. ers, among whom no contention should ever exist but that noble contention, or rather emulation, of who best can work and best agree. **** * PRAYER Thou, 0 God! knowest our down- sitting and our uprising, and under - standest our thought afar off.

About this time King Solomon received a congratulatory letter from Hiram, King of Tyre, desis-ing to participate, in a small de - gree at least, in the rich honors which then seemed to be clustering around his throne.

When we take a survey oI~ nature, we view man in his infancy, muse helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for days, - months and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, or guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself against the inclemencies oE the weather. ~It might have please& the Great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent of all othes- beings: but as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other for protection and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and fs-ienclship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God, and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the c~m - mon stock oI~ knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a DRONE in the Hiva of na - ture, a useless member of society, and un - worthy of our protection as Masons. - THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTiONS.

THE SWORD, POINTING TO A NAKED HEART Demonstrates that justice will soon~s os later overtake us, and although our thoughts, words, and actions may be hidden from the eye of man, yet that ALL-SEEiNG EYE Whom the SUN, MooN, and STARS obey, and under whose watchful care even COMETS perform their stupendous revolutions, per - vades the innermost recesses of the human heart, and rewards us according to ous merits. THE ANCHOR AND THE ARK Are emblems of a well-grounded HOPE and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that Divine ARK which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that ANCHOR which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID This was an invention of our ancient friend and brother, the great PYTHAGORAS, who in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several oi-ders of priesthood, and was raised to the sublime EMBLEMS degree of Master Mason. This wise philoso - pher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more es - l)ecially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most distinguish - ed, he erected this, which, in the joy of his heart, he called EUREKA, in the Grecian language signifying, I HAVE FOUND IT; and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Ma - sons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. THE HOUR-GLASS Is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives as-e drawing to a close! We cannot, without astonishment, behold the little parti - cles which are contained in this machine,— how they pass away almost imperceptibly; and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they are all exhausted. Thus wastes nian! Today he puts forth the ten - der leaves of hope; tumors-ow, blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; and the next day comes a fs-ost which nips the shoot, and when he thinks his great - ness is still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. THE SCYTHE Is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold, what havoc the scythe of time makes — 57— I — 56—"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. sti chtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.sti chtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus .nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw, stichtingargus .nl vw,stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl v~w. stichtingargus.nl vw,Htichtingargus.nl vw,stichtingargus.nl ~‘w. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw. stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl vw.stichtingargus.nl ~‘v. stichtingargus.nl 1w.stichtingargus.nl iw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nl 1w. stichtingargus.nI rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI HONORS among the human race! If by chance we should escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive at the years of manhood; yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of time, and be gather - ed into the land where our fathers have gone before us. * 5 * * * FUNERAL HONORS The Funeral Honors of ~asonry are giv - en thus: Cross the arms upon the bse~ast, the left arm outermost, the hands being open and palms inward; then saise them above the head, the palm~ of the hands striking each other; and then let them fall sharply upon the thighs, the head being bowed. This is thrice done, and the action is ac - companied with the following ejaculation— “The will of God is accomplished !—So mote it be !—Amen 1” PRIVATE GRAND HONORS The private Grand Honors are the signs of the three degrees, given in a manner and upon occasions known only to Master Masons. PUBLIC GRAND HONORS The public Grand Honors are given by clapping the hands nine times. First by striking three times with the right hand, then three times with the left hand, and finally three times with the right hand. — 5S — INSTALLATION SERVICE FOR CONSTITUENT LODGES The jewels ale iiiaced on a small table n front of the nstalling officer.

It may be refused in exceptional cases if deemed to be in the best interests of the Lodge or of the Fraternity. But with this qualification it may be said that every affiliated Master Mason in good standing is entitled to be buried with the formalities of l{asonry, if his family desire~ it, or if he shall have requested it before his death. Therefore, when the Master is informed of the death of a brother, he should at once call on the family to ascertain their wishes.

KNIGHTS TEMPLAR. It frequently happens that a Mason is also a Knight Templar and desires the participation of that order in his obsequies. It is quite appropriate for them to conduce their serv - ices at the house, turning the remains over to the Masonic Fraternity and escorting them to the cemetery. During the Masonic service at the house, church, or the grave the I=nights Templar should form an “oblong square” outside of and parallel to that formed by the Master Masons. WHEN THE LODGE SERVICE BE - GINS the Master has exclusive control until he has finished. However, appropriate por - tions may be completed at the Lodge room, residence, church, and grave, and other services may be performed between as good taste and the ritual permits. WHEN TWO OR MORE MASONIC LODGES participate in the solemn rites, they are formed from front to rear, or from ri~ht to left according to the dates of their charters; the youngest in front or on the — 134 — FUNERAL SERVICE right; provided that a Lodge having to perform the service, though not the oldest, is entitled to the rear, and has charge; otherwise the oldest has charge. THE GRAND MASTER, if present, pre - sides (unless he waives the right) and his place is in the rear of the Master of the officiating Lodge, and supported by a Deacon on each side. The Master’s gavel, Warden’s columns, Deacon’s rods, and Tyler’s swords are tastefully trimmed with black crepe. PALL BEARERS. The pall bearers (usually six in number) should be appointed by the Master from members of the Fra - ternity, due regard being given to their rank and age. In addition to black or dark clothes, it is suggested that there be worn by all Masons attending as such, white gloves, a plain white apron, a black crepe band attached to the left arm above the elbow, and a sprig of evergreen on the left breast. The MARSHAL is selected by the Master from among those bre~thren best skilled in handling men. He wears a black crepe sash over his right shoulder, fastened with a rosette at the left hip, the ends of the scarf hanging down ten to twelve inches below the point of intersection.

The aides have sashes and batons also. The orders of the Marshal and his aides should be promptly obeyed and discipline be maintained throughout the pro - cession. The Marshal carries an apron, which he places on the coffin before it leaves the house. LOUD COMMANDS are out of place. Slouching or irregular marching should be avoided. Distances should be carefully pre - served. A regular march is best. The march should be by twos, but the distance of two yards should be preserved unless the number is large, when the dis - tance should be reduced. The Marshals should place the brethren pioperly aiid caution them to maintain their places.

When a Mason dies away from his home Lodge and it is necessary to go to some expense in his burial, the local Lodge should communicate with the Lodge of which the deceased was a member and arrive at some understanding’ as to the amount involved.

Here shall he slumber until the Archangel’s trump’shall usher in the eventful hour’, when by the Supreme Grand Master’s will he shall be raised to that Blissful Lodge, which no time shall close, and which, to those worthy of admission will be open through the boundless ages of eternity.

The lambskin or white apron is an emblem of innocence and the peculiar badge of a Mason, more ancient than the Golden Fleece or the Roman Eagle, and when worthily worn, more honorable than tl~e Star and Garter, or any other~ order that human power can confer. This’ apron was presented to our brotl~er upon his initiation into our Fraternity and in conformity to our’ ancient custom we now deposit it with his remains. (The Master and brethren now take the evergreen in their hands.) The evergreen which once marked ttie temporary resting place of one illustrious in Masonic history is an emblem of our enduring faith in the immortality of the soul. By it we are r’eminded that we have within us an imperishable part which will survive the grave, and which will never, never’ die. By it we are admonished that like our brother, whose remains now lie before us, we, too, must soon be clothed in the habiliments of death and deposited in the silent tomb.

The Great Creator of Heaven and Earth, having in His Infinite Wisdom, been pleased to remove our brother from the cares and troubles of this transitory life, thereby severing an - other link in the fraternal chain which binds us together, let us, who survive him, be yet more strongly cemented together by the bonds of brotherly Love, that during the short space allotted to us here on earth, we may wisely and usefully employ our’ time and in the interchange of kind and friendly acts, mutually promote the welfare and happiness of each other. In this hour of their bereavement we deeply and sinc~rely sympathize with the beloved relatives of him we mourn and we offer up our most fer - vent prayerthat He who tempers the Wind to the shern lamb will look down with compassion upon the widow and — 154 — F FUNERAL SERVICE the fatherless, and will fold the bene - ficent arm of His love around them.
