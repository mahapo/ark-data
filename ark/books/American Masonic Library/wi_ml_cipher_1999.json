This knowledge may best be obtained by a 5 thorough reading and study of the \"Constitution, Laws, 6 and Edicts of the Grand Lodge,\" the By-Laws of the 7 Constituent Lodges and by conversation with well 8 informed brethren. 9 A Mason's Duty 10 The duty devolves upon every Mason, no matter what 11 his occupation, to preserve the reputation of the 12 Fraternity unsullied. If the conduct of an individual 13 member tends to bring Masonry into disrepute or to 14 injure the Institution, such conduct is unmasonic and 15 should not be allowed to remain unnoticed. 16 Opening 17 1. Congregate: When the Worshipful Master 18 signifies his intention to proceed, every brother must 19 assume his necessary Masonic clothing and be seated. 20 Officers obtain their respective jewels and repair to 21 their appropriate stations and places. 22 2. Tile: Ascertain if the external avenues of the 23 Lodge are securely guarded. 24 3. Purge: Ascertain, in an appropriate manner, the 25 right of each one to be present. 26 4. Lecture: When inquiry is made of the proper 27 officers as to their knowledge of the lectures and of the 28 duties they will be called upon to perform, certain 29 mystic rites are employed by which each brother 30 1 (Revised 06-1995)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"signifies his concurrence in the ceremonies and his 1 knowledge of the degree in which the Lodge is opened. 2 Avouchment and Examination 3 The following Code Regulation will apply: 4 85.01 Requirement. \"The sole requirement for 5 admission to a lodge shall be presentation by the visitor 6 seeking admission of a current official uniform receipt 7 card for dues or other current dues card from the Grand 8 Jurisdiction of which the visitor is a member or a demit 9 less than two years old, and such further evidence as 10 may be satisfactory to the Worshipful Master.\" 11 The last part of the above code regulation would 12 indicate that the Master should assure himself that the 13 visitor is the rightful owner of the dues card he is 14 presenting. 15 Since a suspended Mason cannot enjoy the right of 16 visitation, it may be in order, on occasion, to administer 17 the Test, or Tiler's Oath, which is as follows: 18 \"I, John A. Doe, do hereby and hereon solemnly 19 and sincerely swear that I have been regularly initiated, 20 passed, and raised to the sublime degree of Master 21 Mason in a regularly constituted Lodge of such; that I 22 am not now under sentence of suspension or expulsion 23 and know of no just reason why I should not hold 24 Masonic intercourse with my brethren.

Levity and jesting have no 9 place in the beautiful ceremonies of Initiating, Passing, 10 or Raising. Remember! First impressions are usually 11 lasting ones. Each officer and member of the Lodge 12 should see to it that the right impression is made. 13 In EA: Left knee exposed, c-t around neck. 14 In FC: Right knee exposed, c-t twice around 15 exposed right arm. 16 In MM: Both knees exposed, c-t thrice around 17 body. Note: In all degrees, both slippers are used. 18 Assurance 19 It is a duty incumbent on every Master of a Lodge, 20 before the full ceremony of Initiating, Passing, or 21 Raising takes place, to explain to the candidate the 22 nature of his solemn engagements, and, in a manner 23 peculiar to Masons alone, to require his cheerful 24 acquiescence. 25 Square & Compasses 26 In the EA degree, they are placed on the left, Square 27 above.

This movement is made three 7 times. The hands are brought together on the shoulders, 8 over the head, and at thighs without sound. 9 Funeral Grand Honors are given in same way. 10 Information for Officers 11 The floor work in the Opening, Closing, and First 12 Section of the Degrees is of a precise and exact nature, 13 as contrasted to the greater latitude permitted in the 14 Second Section. 15 The separate parts of a complete movement, 16 including verbal portions, are presented herein in 17 chronological order, and it is important that they be 18 presented in the sequence listed. 19 All movements should be made in a deliberate 20 manner, allowing time for completion thereof, but 21 without unduly prolonging the same. 22 Officers should sit in their respective chairs in a 23 dignified position, both feet on the floor, legs not 24 crossed, and with hands resting on the chair arms if any. 25 An Officer will be dismissed by the Senior in Rank 26 being seated, however, in certain circumstances, such as 27 in saluting the Wardens, he will be dismissed by the 28 Warden with a nod. 29 In moving about the Lodge, care should be taken 30 4"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"that path of movement will be in straight lines, and 1 that changes of direction will be at right angles of 2 ninety degrees, following the teaching of right angles, 3 horizontals and perpendiculars, except when otherwise 4 authorized in the text, explanation or diagram. 5 Before lights are displayed, an Officer, when 6 addressed by a Senior in Rank, will rise if he is seated, 7 without giving salute or response. 8 After lights are displayed, when WM, seated or 9 standing, addresses an Officer, he will rise, if seated, 10 and give the DG & S simultaneously with title, \"WM,\" 11 except as otherwise shown. 12 After lights are displayed, an Officer, when 13 addressed by one Senior in Rank, other than the 14 WM, seated or standing, will rise if seated, without 15 giving salute or response. 16 When an Officer addresses the WM, he rises if 17 seated, gives the DG & S simultaneously with giving 18 the title, \"WM,\" and waits until the WM gives 19 acknowledgment by speaking the title of the Officer 20 before continuing.

If the candidate is successful in 7 passing the ballot box after objection is made in any 8 degree, then any reference to an \"objection\" is 9 omitted from the opening statement in the first section 10 of that particular degree. 11 Proficiency and Ritualist Cards 12 The purpose of these cards is to formally recognize 13 outstanding achievement in the learning and performing 14 of our esoteric ritual. Also, a Proficiency Cardholder is 15 eligible, at the direction of the Grand or District 16 Lecturer, to instruct in any lodge. In addition, all 17 Proficiency Cardholders are entitled to serve as judges 18 at the Masonic Degree Competition. 19 A \"Proficiency Card\" is issued to any member who 20 commits to memory the complete esoteric portions of 21 all three degrees. More accurately stated, a member is 22 considered proficient if he is able to speak and perform 23 every position in all three degrees, including the 2nd- 24 section lectures, opening, closing, calling up and down, 25 and reception of Grand Lodge Officers. 26 A \"Ritualist Card\" is issued to any member who 27 achieves the level of proficiency stated above, but in 28 only one or two of the degrees. Also, at the option 29 of the Grand or District Lecturer, to any brother who 30 6"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"memorizes the posting and conducts the exam in open 1 lodge. 2 It is a logical progression that a brother will achieve 3 proficiency in a degree, thus receiving his Ritualist 4 Card for that degree; then move on to the next degree; 5 then finally becoming a \"Proficiency Man\" upon 6 completion of the third degree. 7 The Grand or District Lecturer (or his appointee) 8 will examine you to approve your qualifications to 9 receive any of the cards listed. Simply contact them, 10 your Area Administrator, or your District Deputy to 11 indicate your desire to be approved to receive the card. 12 Suggested Work Assignments 13 Brethren always remember that the first duty of a 14 Lodge is to make good Masons, and this can best be 15 done by doing good degree work. It is, therefore, the 16 responsibility of the Master to call rehearsals when 17 and as often as he feels is necessary.

This degree is to be used only in a tiled meeting, never during a public ceremony, and must be conducted on the Master Mason degree. It can be given prior to any stated communication, or at a special meeting. Prior to the opening of a lodge of Master Masons, the Worshipful Master should appoint a regular officer or member to chaperone the brethren receiving the Traveler’s Refresher Degree. All brethren to receive the degree should assemble in the Tiler’s room during the opening of the Master Mason Degree. During the opening, the chaperone should provide adhesive nametags, and each recipient should write their names and display their nametags so that all the brethren may greet them and make them feel welcome.
