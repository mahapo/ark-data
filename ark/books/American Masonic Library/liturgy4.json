The Knights of this Order originally united themselves together in the times of the Crusades; when, in consequence of the general disorder that prevailed all over Europe, and the multitude of estates and titles left to be disputed, wrong and ‘~‘iolence went unrebuked, and became superior to the law. Composed at first of a few Masons, who had learned the rules of justice from the teachings of the Order, they exerted only a moral influence, owing to the purity of their lives, and the justice of their opinions. They called themselves Noachite Masons; because they strove to mu - tate the primeval justice and purity of the beloved Pa - triarch. Finding that where their influence was most needed, mere advice and exhortation, addressed to the rude Barons and haughty, rapacious Priesthood, had no effect, they assumed the power to enforce performance of their judgments; and through the common people and a multi - tude of the poorer Knights, who had found the benefit of their protection, and who revered their justice, they found a ready means of compelling obedience, and inflicting pun-. ishment. Their number was limited, and their persons unknown. They met always at night, when the moon was full; and the more perfectly to remain unknown, allowed no light but hers. Lest their own members should become haughty and. vain-glorious on account of the mysterious power they possessed, they inculcated humility, and incessantly re - minded each other of that haughtiness and pride which led the descendants of Noah to erect the Tower of Babel; and of the miseries of Phaleg, who suggested the idea of its building; and who therefor condemned himself to a rigor - ous penitence, and buried himself in the vast solitudes of Northern Germany, m what is now the kingdom of Prussia, where he is said to have builded a temple in the shape of a Delta, and therein to have passed his life, imploring the mercy of GOD."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"48 TWENTY-FIRST DEGREE. The Order, in several parts of Germany, was popularly known as the Holy Yehme: and even kings trembled at its judgments. It continued to exercise its vast powers, until law and civilization rendered them no longer neces - sary; but the Order still continued to exist, deciding Ma-. sonic controversies only; and inflicting no other than Masonic punishments. As it continued more particularly to flourish in Prussia, where Frederick of Brunswick, King of Prussia, became the Grand Master General of the Order, the members took the name of Prussian Knights, out of gratitude to that Monarch, whose ancestors were for three hundred years its patrons. The Chapters of this Degree are no longer tribunals to try and punish for offenses committed without the limits of Masonry. They claim no jurisdiction except between their own members, and exercise none between those of the in - ferior degrees, except by their consent. And in all their judgments it is their rule and duty to judge of other men’s motives and actions by the same rules by which they judge their own; to believe others equally as honest in their views as themselves; and to find for the conduct of others the same excuses that they find for their own; for this alone is justice. And they prove their humility by their tolerance; which causes them to believe that their opinions are as likely to be erroneous as the opinions of others to the contrary, and that the Deity alone knows what is truth. They meet only on the nights of the full moon; and allow no other light than hers; because such was the ancient custom of the Order, derived from the mysteries of Ceres and the old worship of Isis. In the Heavenly host they admire the work of the Supreme Creator, and the universal laws of harmony and moLion, the two first laws that emanated from GOD. .9"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"NOACHI’IE, OR PRUSSIAN KNIGHT. 49 TO CLOSE. * * * * * We have heard the complaints of the op - pressed; we have judged those denounced to us as crim - inals; we have administered Justice and regarded Mer - cy * * * * To go forth and labor in the cause of struggling human - ity; to imitate in our conduct and conversation the right - eous Patriarch; and thus to become true Noachites. * * * * w * To remember the fate of Phaleg; and warned thereby, to be modest and humble, and not boastful, vain-glorious, or wise in our own conceit. * * * * * * This Grand Chapter is darkened, and its labors end. * * * * * * 0.•.

The Tsidunai or Phcenicians were ever ready to aid the Israelites in their holy enterprises. The tie between them was the mysteries, into which the principal persons of both nations were initiated; Moses having necessarily received them in Egypt, before he could marry the daughter of a priest of On. These mysteries, modified by Solomon, or perhaps at an earlier day by Joshua or even Moses, to suit the genius and manners of the Jewish people, became Masonry, such as it was practiced at the building of the Temple, and such as it has in part come down to us. Khi3.rfim, King of Tst~r in Phcenicia, and Khi~ri~m Abai, also a Ph~nician and not a Jew, were likewise initiates; and hence the intimate connection between them and Solomon, as Masons. The people of TsidI~n, a city of Phcenicia, were employed by Noah to cut cedars on Mount Libanus, of which to build the ark, under the superintendence of Japhet. His descendants repeopled Tsidw~n and Phcenicia, and at a later day his posterity, under Adon Khfiriim, cut in the same forests cedars for King Solomon: and at a time still later, they felled timber on the same momi - tain to construct the second Temple. Upon the same mountain it is said that they established Colleges or Associations of Artificers, like those of Etruxia"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"KNIGHT ROYAL AXE, OR PRINCE OF LIBANUS. 59 and afterward of Rome. Of this we can only say that it is possible, because associations of workers have been com - mon in all ages. It is supposed that there were Colleges of A.rtiflcers in Etruria, as there certainly were at Rome; and Phcenicians, who voyaged far and traded everywhere, and who honored the skili of the Architect and Artisan, no doubt had similar colleges. Wherever such associations existed, they necessarily had modes of recognition of each other; and they were honored everywhere. Solomon himself, whose wisdom gave him a true idea of the dignity of labor, built a palace on the moun - tam, to which he often repaired to inspect the progress of the work. The names of the Patriarchs who were the Su - perintendents of the woripuen on the mountain at different periods are preserved in our pass-words.

First comes the COURT of the Tabernacle, which was a rectan- c. gular inclosure, 150 feet long from East to West (if the cubit be o taken to have been 18 inches), and 75 feet wide from North to g South. It was formed (except the gate or entrance) by curtains of white linen, 7+ feet high, supported by pillars of acacia wood, 0: set in brass sockets, and with hooks and fiflets of silver.

Of these, 5 were coupled to - gether in one piece, and 6 in another; and the two pieces were so arranged, with 50 loops on one edge of each, and 50 hooks of brass, that they could be fastened together, “that it might be one.” 5"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"66 TWENTY-THIRD DEGREE. This junction of the two parts, both of the inner and outer curtains, must have been in the West; and in the East, which was the front, the whole width of the tent must have been open. The excess in width of the outer tent, over that of the inner Tabernacle, seems to have been so disposed of as to lap over in front and rear. Then there was a covering for the outer tent, of sheepskins, dyed red; and over that again a covering of what are supposed to have been seals’ skins. There were also 48 boards of acacia wood, prepared to be set C up endwise on the ground, each with two tenons setting into two sockets of silver at the bottom. These boards were each 15 feet high, and 2 feet 3 inches wide. There were 20, we are told, I “for the Tabernacle, on the South side, southward;” 20 for f “the other side of the Tabernacle, toward the North corner; “ 6 for “the sides of the Tabernacle westward;” and 2 “for the I corners of the Tabernacle on the two sides.” These two were t “coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to 5 one ring.” There were also bars of acacia wood; 5 “for the boards on the North side, 5 for those on the South, and 5 for the two sides westward.” The middle bar shot through the boards from one end to the other; or, “in the midst of the boards reached from end to end.” The boards and bars were overlaid with gold; and the bars fitted into rings of gold. Within and across the Tabernacle, dividing it into two parts, was a vail or cnrtain, to be drawn aside with cords, each way, of blne, purple, scarlet, and fine white linen thread, artistically t embroidered with cherubim, and otherwise, and hung by gold I hooks in sockets of silver on 4 pillars of acacia wood.

They vary in size, and have accordingly a greater or less number of poles to support them—from 3 to 9. And it is usual for one large tent to be divided into two or more apartments by curtains, for the different portions of the family. The tents of the Bedaweens are not conical, as they are often represented in pictures, but have a roof edged with drop-cur - tains, or such curtains as might be made from the dark, tanned skins of goats, hung around the eaves. Most writers who have undertakeu’~to describe the Tabernacle, say, with Kitto, that its framework consistcd of the perpendicu - lar gilded boards of acacia wood, fixed into silver sockets, and kept together by means of gold rings, through which transverse bars were passed: and that over this framework the coverings were spread; the inner curtains being suspended by hooks and eyes within the framework, and the outcr one, of goats’ hair, hanging over it on the outside. But besides that the boards, with all their work of gold, would thus be entirely hidden, it is impossible to make the measure - ments given agrce with this idea. There were 20 boards on the North, and the same number on the South of the Tabernacle, and 8 on the West and at the two corners. Each of these was 1~ cubits wide, or in all 72 cubits, for the measurement, on this supposition, inside of the tent, of the North, West, and South sides of it. This would make the length of the tent more than 30 cubits; whereas it was made of curtains, 5 on each side, and 4 cubits wide, making but 40 cubits for the measurement of the same sides of the tent, if the curtains hung down on the inside. And if it is supposed that the curtains were stretched lengthwise, we still have but twice 28 cubits, or 56, instead of 72, for the same measurement."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"68 TWENTY-THIRD DEGREE. Below is a drawing of a Bedaween tent, used by a family on a farming trip, with a little fence surrounding it. We find no evidence anywhere of a custom to have a framework of boards within the tent: and the text of Exodus says nothing of the kind. And therefore it is not doubtful that the boards of acacia wood, gilded, and with their gilded bars and hooks and plates of gold, formed such a fence, 10 cubits, or from 15 to 17j. feet high, on the outside of the Tabernacle, and on its North, South, and West, in this shape: preventing any one from improperly approaching the Tabernacle, except in front. As the fence extended on each side some distance beyond the front of the tent, and as the boards were fastened together by bars and rings, its extremities could perhaps be brought together in front, so as entirely to inclose the tent, or be turned off each way at right angles. Thus the Tabernacle in the Lodge-room should represent a tent, oblong in shape, stretched upon a frame of poles and forks, one pole in the middle serving as a ridge-pole. Over this, hanging to the floor, on the North and South sides, and the rear or West, and reaching on top, on each side, to and over the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CHIEF OF THE TABERNACLE. 69 ridge-pole, should be two curtains, joining together by hooks and loops in the middle of the rear, of white, blue, scarlet, and purple linen or cotton thread woven together, and embroidered with cherubim, or animals with the bodies of lions, the feet of oxen, the faces of men, and the wings of eagles. Over this should be similar curtains of gray woolen stuff: and on top, as a covering, red morocco, and over that, tanned leather. The hanging curtain at the mouth of the tent, and the vail dividing the Tabernacle into two parts, should be as above described; as also should the inclosure of the Court, if not the fence. The furniture of the Lodge is as follows: In front of, and perhaps ten feet from the entrance of the Tabernacle, is the altar of sacrifice, made of white soft wood, hollow, and plated on top with brass. It is to be 4j feet high, and ‘Zj- feet square, with projections in the shape of tongues of flame (called horns in the Bible) at each corner, standing up - right. It is made to be carried by staves of light wood, banded with brass, passing through rings in two of the sides. Between this altar and the Tabernacle is a layer or large basin of bronze, with a foot to it, filled with water. In the front part of the tent, in front of the vail, on the North side, is the Table of the Presence or Shew-bread. It is made of white wood, and is 3j- feet long, lj. broad, and 2~ high, the top covered with plates of brass, gilded, and with a gilded rim or border round its edge on the top. Below the top is a strip of wood 4 inches wide, with a similar rim or border round its lower edge. A little lower down, at equal distances from the top, is a ring, gold-plated, on each leg, through which gilded staves pass to carry it. On this table are twelve small loaves of wheat bread, in two piles of six each, sprinkled with frankincense and salt; and a large bowl of pure wine. On the South side of the tent, opposite the table, is the cai~ - delabrum, all gilded, to represent pure gold. It consists of an ornamented base, of a shaft rising out of it, and six arms, coming out by threes from two opposite sides of the shaft, each"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"70 TWENTY-THIRD DEGREE. two arms equidistant from the central shaft forming a semicircle, and all being in one line, and of equal height or level on top. On the summit of the central shaft, and on those of the six arms, are lamps, not candles, all in globular shades, but the central one being much the largest. These lamps are to be fed with pure olive-oil alone. Before the middle of the vail, and in the outer part of the tent, is the altar of incense, 18 inches square, and 3 feet high, with flames or horns of brass at each corner, the top covered with a plate of yellow metal, imitating gold, with a rim of the same round it, and two gold rings on each of two opposite sides, below the rim, for gilded staves or rods to pass through, by which to carry it. In the centre of the inner portion of the tent (the ~P1~ Kadosh Kadoshim, or HOLY OF HouEs,) stands the Ark of the Covenant, a box of white wood, 3~ feet long, 24 broad, and 24 high, with short feet at each corner. It is plated within and without with brass or tin galvanized, so as to appear like pure gold, and has round its upper edge a rim or cornice all round, gilded to represent gold. On the two longer sides, at the corners, are four rings, gilded, to receive the staves of white wood, gilded, by which it is carried. On the Ark is a lid, called the EXPIATORY (or MERCY-SEAT), as long and wide as the Ark, and representing solid gold. At each end is, also, as of solid gold, a cherub, or winged figure of a lion, each with two wings long enough to meet half-way be - tween them, higher than their heads. Their heads should be bent down, as though looking upon the Expiatory. On the altar of incense are the roll of the Book of the Law and a poniard; and on the Book of the Law, the Square and Compass. The presiding officer sits in the East, represents AABoK, and is styled “Most Excellent High-Priest.” The Wardens sit in the West, and represent his two sons, ELEAZAR and ITXAMAR, and are styled “Excellent Priests.” The Orator, Secretary, and Treasurer sit on the East of the Tabernacle, the Master of"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"A CHIEF OF THE TABERNACLE. 71 Ceremonies on the West of it, the Expert on the South of it, and the Assistant Expert on the North. The other officers and members sit on the North, South, and West of it. All except the three first officers are styled “ Worthy Levites.” The presiding officer wears a pair of linen drawers, reaching from the waist to the middle of the thighs; a robe or gown, of pure white linen, reaching to the feet, fitting close to the body, with loose sleeves coming as low a~ the elbows; covering the shoulders, and closed roQnd the neck with strings. This is girded to the body, just under the breast, by a girdle four fingers broad, wound round and round the body from the breasts to the navel, and the ends hanging down to the ankles. The robe is embroidered with needle-work, in different colors; and the girdle is of loosely woven white cotton, embroidered with flowers of blue, scarlet, and purple. Over the robe or gown is the “robe of the Aphod,” an Egyptian tunic of blue stuff, woven in one piece, with an aperture for the neck in the middle of it, and apertures for the arms; without sleeves, large and loose, and reaching to the knees. Round the hem, at the bottom, is a fringe of blue, scarlet, and purple tassels, in the form of pome - granates, with a small gilded bell between each two; this is also tied round with a girdle, white, embroidered with blue, scarlet, and purple, and gold interwoven. He wears also the Aphod, a short cloak with sleeves, of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen thread, embroidered richly, and covering the shoulders, by shoulder-pieces that unite the back and front parts, which are separate. On each shoulder of it is an imitation of an agate, set in gold, and each having upon it six names of the tribes, according to precedence of birth. This Aphod has strings, that go out from each side, and tie it to the body. He also wears the breastplate or gorget, ten inches square, of the same sort of cloth as the Aphod, doubled so as to form a kind of pouch, to hold the AUBIM and THEMIM. On its outside are twelve precious stones, in four rows, as they are named in Exodus xxviii. 17—20; on each of which is engraved the name"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"72 TWENTY-TmXD DEGREE. of one of the tribes. This is fastened to the front of the Aphod by means of dark-blue ribbons, tied in four rings of gold at the corners of the breastplate, and four that meet them on the Aphod itself. The rings at the upper corners are on the inside of the breastplate, but those below are outside. There are also two other rings of gold, larger, at the upper corners, on the outside, from which cords of twisted gold-thread reach and fasten to the agates on the shoulders. And it is further fastened by a sash or girdle, of the same stuff as itself, to which the lower side is attached, and which is tied in front of the body and hangs down to the lower edge of the Aphod. The Urim or Aurim, and Thummim or Themim, carried in the pouch or breastplate, are small images of sapphire (or blue stone), of RE and THMEI, LIGHT and TRuTh, in a sitkng pos - ture, each holding the tau cross. The Bo~~r is a turban of fine white linen, circular, covering half the head, something like a crown, of thick linen swathes doubled round many times, and sewed together, surrounded by a linen cover, to hide the seams of the swathes. The mitre of the High-Priest is this turban, with another above it, of swathes of blue, embroidered, so that the whole is conical in shape. In front of this turban, on the forehead, is a plate of gold, extend - ing from one ear to the other, fastened by strings tied behind, and also by a blue ribbon attached to the mitre; on which is engraved the inscription: ‘f’A~1’ KADOSE L’IHOH, “Hou~ss TO THE LoRD!

For the scarlet seemed emblematical of fire, the fine linen of the earth, the blue of the air, and the purple of the Bea; two of them being thus compared for their color; the fine linen and the purple on account of their origin, as the earth produces the one and the sea the other.” To us, in this degree, the WHITE of the Apron, its princi - pal and chief color, is symbolical of the infinite B~xi~’i - CENCE of GOD; the BLUE, of His profound and perfect Wis - DOM; the CRIMSON, of His GLORY; and the Puapu, of His PowRE. The candelabrum with seven branches, upon the Apron, wrought in gold, represents to us, as it represented to the ancient Hebrews, what were known in the earlier ages as the seven planets, or principal heavenly bodies, the Sun in the middle, with Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn on one side, and Venus, Mercury, and the Moon on the other. It also repre - sents the seven archangels whom the Hebrews assigned to the government of those planets; ZERAXHI-AL, the DAWN, or RISING of GOD, to the SUN; Aum-AL, the LIGHT of Gon, to MARS; GABARI-AL, the STRENGTH of GOD, to JUPrrE:R; MAYAK-AL, the SEMBLANCE of GOD, to SA’rtmN; KHAMAU-AL, the MEI~ur of GOD, to VENUS; RAPH-AL, the HEALING of Gon, to M~cimy; and TSAPH-AL, the MESSENGER of GOD, to the MOON: of whom MAYAX-AL, or MICHAEL, was represented with the head of a LION; AtTEI-AL, or AURmI~, with that of an Ox; RALPH-AL, or RAi~i, with a HImLAX head and the body of a Serpent; and GABARI-AL, or GABRIEl, with that of an EAGLE: all of the seven being attributes and manifes - tations of AL, the great Semitic Nature-God of the ancient Patriarchs; as to whom, and these planets and angels, and their connection with Masonry, you will be more fully in - structed as you advance.

Under the symbols of the seven planets which it represents, the ancients figured the seven virtues, so peculiarly Masonic.

These Forces, analogou3 and contrary the one to the other, by their counter-action, produce the equilibrium, and regulate the movements of the spheres. The Hebrews called them the Seven Great Archangels. The seven plan - ets correspond with the seven colors of the prism, and the seven notes of the musical octave.

It burns with a three-fold flame: the Cloak is in three folds: and the Staff is divided into three parts. This number, nine, is that of the reflexes of the Deity, and expresses the Divine Idea in all its abstract power. Hence it is sacred in Masonry.

History i 8 silent as to the language of that explanation. Hear, however, it8 substance, as spoken in the Deserts four thousand years ago: “You are taught by this Mystery,” it was said to him, “that the Heathen Gods are Unrealities, and mere ideal personifications either of the heavenly bodies, of the Pow - ers of Nature, or of the’ Principles of Light and Darkness, and Good and Evil The Egyptians, Phc~nicians, Chal - deans, and Philistines have thus given to the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, Heaven, Earth, the Sky, Light, Fire, the Air, and the Sea, personal characteristics and names. They worship the Powers of Nature in the Constellations, and the Constellations in the animals imaged there. The idol is mere wood and stone, an attempt to express more palpa - bly than by words a confused and indefinite notion. Our People, prone to idol-worship, are forbidden to make to themselves any symbol or image of the Deity. There is but one Only True GoD, who hath no bodily shape, no name, nor hath been seen of any man. He is not the Light, nor Fire, but pure Absolute Th’rEu~cr and EXISTENCE, the Soul and Spirit of the Universe, which He created with a thought. The Past, the Present, and the illimitable Future, the infi - nite series of events and successions of time in both direc - tions, are all present to Him at one and the same moment. There is to Him no Future and no Past. Present every - where, there is to Him neither H~E nor ELSEWHEBE. Everything to Him is HxR~ and Now.

What we term His punish - ments are but the inevitable results, that by His great laws of cause and effect, which themselves are outfiowings of the Universal Harmony, follow sin and crime as their conse - quences. The Soul is immortaL The body, perishing, separates into atoms, and mingles again with nature, and enters into new bodies, of man, of animal, of the mineral and vegeta - ble world. The Soul, a spark of the Universal Soul, un - prisoned in the body, becomes sordid with the body’s im - perfections; and must be purified before it can return and mingle again with the Universal Source. It is immortal, not of necessity, but unless GoD pleases, as it and all things emanated from Him, to absorb it again into Himself. No sin that man commits will go unpunished, and after death the Soul will feel the consequences of its sins and errors here, by a law as inflexible as that which holds the Stars to their courses. You are also taught how constant is the struggle in every man’s nature between the Divine will, implanted in every man by GoD, and the natural will, prone to vice and error, and caused by the frailty of the flesh. Osiris and T&ph3n, 9p~nta Mainyn and Aura Maii;yii, Vishnu and Siva, make of every human soul, as they do of the universe, a battle-field. All the universe coheres.

Science is absolutely impotent to decide whether we are right or wrong in believing a dogma. Faith, in it - self, considered as a physiological fact, is evidently a neces - sity and a force. * * * * * * The dogma of Masonry is that of Zarathustra and Hermes; its Law is progressive initiation ; its principle Equality, reg - ulated by a Hierarchy and universal Fraternity. It is the continuation of the school of Alexandria, the heir of all the ancient initiations. It is the depositary of the secrets of the Apocalypse and the Sohai. The object of its worship is T~ Taum, which it represents in its Lodges by the LIGHT. It tolerates all creeds, and professes but a single and the same philosophy. It seeks Truth alone, teaches the reality only, and strives to lead by degrees all intellects to the Reason. The allegorical object of Masonry is the rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon; its real object is the reconstruction of social unity, by the affiance of Reason and Faith, and the re-establishment of the Hierarchy, in the way of Science and Virtue, with initiation and trials for its Degrees. * * * * * * Masonry is the Gnosis; and the false Gnostics have con - demned the true.

To arrive at a complete knowledge of the doctrine, they had to pass three degrees of instruction. The Initiates were consequently divided into three classes; the first, Auditors, the second, Cateckumens, and the third, the FaithfuL The Auditors were novices, prepared by cer - tain ceremonies and instruction to receive the dogmas of Christianity. A portion of these dogmas was made known to the Catechumens; who, after particular purification; received baptism, or the initiation of the the 5g~nesis (divine generation); but in the grand mysteries of that religion, the incarnation, nativity, passion, and resurrection of Christ, none were initiated but the FaithfuL These doctrines, and the celebration of the Holy Sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, were kept with profound secrecy. The mysteries were divided into two parts; the first styled the Mass of the’ Catechumens; the second, the Mass of the Faithful. The celebration of the Mysteries of Mithras was also styled a mass; and the ceremonies used were the same. The Cafr didate was purified by a species of baptism, a mark was impressed upon his forehead, he offered bread and water, pronouncing certain mysterious words. The Basilideans, a sect of Christians that arose soon after I"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"PRINCE OF MERCY. 135 the time of the Apostles, practiced the Mysteries, with the old Egyptian legend. They symbolized Osiris by the Sun, Isis by the Moon, and Tfiph6n by Scorpio; and wore crystals bearing these emblems, as amulets or talismans to protect them from danger; upon which were also a brilliant star and the serpent. They were copied from the talismans of Persia and Arabia, and given to every Candidate at his initiation. Iren~us tells us that the Simonians, one of the earliest sects of the Guostics, had a Priesthood of the Mysteries. Tertullian tells us that the Yalentinians, the most cele - brated of all the Gnostic schools, imitated, or rather per - verted, the Mysteries of Eleusis. Iren~us informs us, m several curious chapters, of the Mysteries practiced by the Marcosians; Origen gives much information as to the Mys - teries of the Ophites; and there is no doubt that all the Gnostic sects had mysteries and an initiation. They all claimed to possess a secret doctrine, coming to them di - rectly from Christ, different from that of the Gospels and Epistles, and superior to those communications, which, in their eyes, were merely exoteric. This secret doctrine they did not communicate to every one; and among the exten - sive sect of the Basilideans hardly one in a thousand knew it, as we learn from Iren~us. We know the name of only the highest class of their initiates. They were styled Elect, and Strangers to the World. They had at least three de - grees, the Material, the Intellectual, and the Spiritual; and the lesser and greater mysteries: and the number of those who attained the highest degree was quite small Baptism was one of their most important ceremonies; and the Basilideans celebrated the 10th of January as the anniversary of the day on which Christ was baptized in Jordan. They had the ceremony of laying on of hands, by way of purification; and that of the mystic banquet, emblem of that to which they believed the Heavenly Wisdom would one day admit them, in the fullness of things. Their ceremonies were much more like those of the Chris-"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"136 TWENTY-SiXTH DEGREE. tians than those of Greece; but they mingled with them much that was borrowed from the Orient and Egypt; and taught the primitive truths, mixed with a multitude of fan - tastic errors and fictions. The Discipline of the Secret was the concealment or oc - cultation of certain tenets and ceremonies. So says Clemens of Alexandria. To avoid persecution, the early Christians were compelled to use great precaution, and to hold meetings of the Faith - ful [of the Household of Faith] in private places, under con - cealment by darkness. They assembled in the night, and they guarded against the intrusion of false brethren and profane persons, spies, who might cause their arrest Dur - ing the early persecutions they took refuge in the vast cata - combs which stretched for miles in every direction under the city of Rome, and are supposed to have been of Etrus - can origin. There, amid labyrinthine windings, deep cav - erns, hidden chambers, chapels and tombs, the persecuted fugitives found refuge, and there they performed the cere - monies of the Mysteries. They conversed together figuratively, and by the use of symbols; and those who were initiated were bound by solemn promise not to disclose or even converse about the secrets of the Mysteries, except with such as had received them under the same sanction. In the ]JierarcAi~, attributed to St. Dionysius the Are - opagite, the first Bishop of Athens, the tradition of the sacrament is said to have been divided into three degrees, or grades, pumfication, initiation, and accomplishment or per - fection; and it mentions also, as part of the ceremony, the bringing to light. * * * * * * And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the Chief Priests and the Scribes and the Elders; and they laid hands on him and took"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"PRINCE OF MERCY. 137 him... They cried, saying, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” And Pilate said unto them the third time, “Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him. I will therefore chastise him and let him go.” And they were instant, with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and the voices of them and of the Chief Priests prevailed. * * * * * * o.~. And the Chief Priests and all the Council sought for witnesses against Jesus, to put him to death... And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. And the Chief Priests moved the people that Pilate should rather release Barabbas unto them. And the Chief Priests and Scribes stood and vehemently accused him. * * * * * * e.g. And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. And the soldiers of the Gov - ernor platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head: and after they had mocked him, they led him away to crucify him. And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. * * * * * * Certain explanations have been given, by Christian Ma - sons, of some of the ceremonies of the three first Degrees, which, whatever your faith, may not be uninteresting to you, since you are in nowise required to receive them as correct.

Prone to evil, the hu - man race staggered blindly onward into the thick darkness of unbelief~ bound fast by the strong cable-tow of the nat - ural and sinful will. Moral corruption was followed by physical misery. Want and destitution invaded the earth.

Toward GOD, of lov9, gratitude, and veneration, and an anxious desire to serve and glorify Him; toward his fellows, of kindness, sympathy, and justice.

The Christian, reconciled to GOD, sees the world in a new light. It is no longer a mere machine, wound up and set going and left to run on afterward forever, by virtue of a law of mechanics created at the beginning, without further care or consideration on the part of the Deity: but it has now become to him a great emanation from GOD, the product of His thought, a thing of life, over which GOD watches continually, and every movement of which is imme - diately produced by His present action, the law of harmony being the essence of the Deity, re-enacted every instant.

Nor can he object if others see in the Woiw that was in the beginning with GOD, and Which GOD was, only the Loaos of Plato and Phio, and the Uttered THOUGHT or First Emanation of LIGHT, or the REASON, of the Great, Silent, Uncreated Deity, believed in and adored by all We do not undervalue the importance of any Truth. We utter no word that can be deemed irreverent by any one of any faith. We do not tell the Moslem that it is only im - portant for him to believe that there is but one GOD, and wholly unessential whether Mahomet was his Prophet We do not tell the Hebrew that the Messiah whom he ex - pects was born in Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago; and as little do we tell the Christian that JESUS of Nazareth was but a man, or his history the revival of an older legend. To do either is beyond our jurisdiction. Masonry, of no one age, belongs to all time; of no one re - ligion, it finds its great truths in all. To every Mason, there is a GOD; ORE, Supreme, Infinite in GOodness, Wisdom, Foresight, Justice, and Benevolence; Creator, Disposer, and Preserver of all things.

Masonry was not made to settle that. Thus it disbelieves no truth, and teaches unbelief in no creed, except so far as such creed may lower its lofty esti - mate of the Deity, degrade Him to the level of the passions of humanity, deny the high destiny of man, impugn the goodness and benevolence of the Supreme Gon, strike at the great columns of Masonry, FArrH, HOPE, and CHASITY, or inculcate immorality, and disregard of the active duties of the Order. * * * * * * The greatest mysteries in the Universe are those which are ever going oil, around us; so trite and common to us that we never note them or reflect upon them.

The Latin word tessera originally meant a square piece of wood or stone, used in making tesserated pavements, after - ward a tablet on which anything was written, and then a cube or die. Its most general use was to designate a piece of metal or wood, square in shape, on which the watch-word of an army was inscribed; whence tessera came to mean the watch-word itself. There was also a tessera Iwepitalis, which was a piece of wood cut into two parts, as a pledge of friend - ship. Each party kept one of the parts, and they swore mutual fidelity by Jupiter. To break the tessera was con - sidered a dissolution of the friendship. The early Chris - tians nsed it as a Mark, the watch-word of friendship. With them it was generally iii the shape of a fish, and made of bone. On its face was inscribed the word I~S’v~, a fish, the initials of which represented the Greei words, I,?tioi~ Xpztir6~ eeoC; Tz~3~, ~c.nip; JEsus CHRIST, the Soil of GoD, the Saviour.

When St. Jean d’Acre, the ancient Ptolemais, on the southern side of which was Mount Carmel, was besieged by the Christian forces, for nearly two years, under Guy of Lu-. signan, King of Jerusalem, Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat, and other princes and leaders from every country in Europe; and especially by Henry VI. of Germany, son of Frederic Barbarossa, joined, near the end of the siege, by Philip Au - gustus of France and Richard Ceur de Lion of England; they were long afflicted with famine, until they ate the flesh of horses with joy, and even the intestines sold for ten sons; men of high rank, and the sons of great men, greedily de - voured grass; the starving fought together like dogs for the little bread baked at the ovens; they gnawed the bones that had already been gnawed by the dogs; and noblemen, ashamed to beg, were known to 8teal bread. Constant rains added to their miseries; and Salah-Eddeen, Sultan of the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"KNIGHT COMMA~DER OF THE TEMPLE. 167 Saracens, encamped near them with a vast army from every portion of his dominions, and all the great Emirs of Islamism harassed them with constant attacks; Salah-Eddeen, whom his people called the Elect of GOD; Malek-Ad.hel, Sayf-Ed - deen his Brother; the Prince of Hamah, his nephew; and the Princes of Damascus and Aleppo, his sons; the yellow and green banners of the Emirs of Emessa, the Princes of Baal - bec, Harran, and Edessa, in Mesopotamia, Singar and Ge - zire, on the Tigris, and all the tents of Islamism. Sickness, also, caused by the rains and the intense heat, decimated the Christian forces. The wounded German soldiers, whom none of the others understood, could not make known their sickness nor their necessities. Certain German nobles from the cities of Bremen and Lubec, who had arrived at Acre by sea, moved by the miseries of their countrymen, took the sails of their ships, and made of them a large tent, in which for a time they placed the wounded Germans, and tended them with great kindness. Forty nobles of the same nation united with them, and estab - lished a kind of hospital in the midst of the camp; and this noble and charitable association, like the knights of the Temple and of St. John of Jerusalem, soon and in- sensibly became a new Hospitaler and Military Order. This was in the year 1191 In 1192, Pope Celestin 111., at the request of the Emperor Henry Vt, solemnly ap - proved of the Order, by his Bull of the 23d of February. He prescribed, as regulations for the new Knights, those of Saint Augustine; and for special statutes, in all that re - garded the poor and sick, those of the Hospitalers of St. John; in regard to military discipline, the regulations of the Templars. This new Order, exclusively composed of Germans, was styled “The Order of Teutonic knights, of the House of St. Mary of Jerusalem;” as the Templars were styled “of the House of the Temple at Jerusalem.” The author of the “Critical and Apologetic History” of the Templars (Rev. Father Mansuet Jeune), says: “A great number of German noblemen, who had followed that Prince (Frederic of Suabia, second son of the Em-"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"168 TWENTY-SEVENTH DEGREE. peror,) to Acre as volunteers, some actuated by religious enthusiasm, and some by the desire of glory, joined the sol - dieries of the Temple and of the Hospital, or engaged in attending on the wounded and caring for the sick of their nation. This was the origin of the Teutonic Order, the first branch of that of the Templars. “The Staff, desiring to advance these pious gentlemen, and to gratify the German nation, proposed to them the institution of a new Order of Chivalry, to be at once hos - pitaler and military. Forty German lords, distinguished by their nobility and feats of arms, agreed to this, and be - came the founders and original members of the Order. On entering the Order, they bound themselves by the three solemn vows, and also obliged themselves to serve the poor, in imitation of the Hospitalers, and to follow the claustral and military discipline of the Templars, in peace as well as in war. Their title of Knights of the House of St. Mary of Jeru - salem was given them, because, while the city of Jerusalem was under the government of the Latin Christians, a Ger - man had erected there, at his own expense, a Hospital and Oratory for the sick of his nation, under the protection of and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. An old writer says that the Order was founded “by an Almain, who, with his wife, settling in Jerusalem, after the taking of the city, founded there a Hospital for the reception of pilgrims, with an Oratory dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and in a short time had drawn such resort, that from thence arose a Fraternity, electing a Grand Mas - ter.” The author first cited again says: “HENRi WA.LPOT,” (Heinrich Walpoti,) “was elected the first Master of the growing Order, and was put in possession of the Hospital of Mount Sion, as the principal place of the Establishment. The Popes and Sovereigns, induced thereto by the services rendered theretofore by the other two Military Orders, were not slow in proving their favorable opinion of this. It re - ceived from the Holy See the same privileges as the Tem -"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"KNIGHT COMMANDER OF THE TEMPLE. 169 plars and Hospitalers; and the right was granted it of holding in perpetuity all such lands and provinces as it might conquer from the Moslems. “It was divided into seven Provinces: Armenia, Achais, Sicily, Teutonic Puglia, Austria, Prussia, and Livonia.” “The Templars had adopted a form of government, in part monarchical and in part aristocratic, of which the Grand Master was the Chief, and the Marshal, Draper, and &n~chal, with the Provincial Masters, were the principal members. The Teutonic Knights adopted the same system, with the addition of a Hospitaler, an office borrowed from the Knights of St. John the Baptist or Hospitalers.” The Grand Master was chosen by Electors. When a vacancy occurred, the Lieutenant Grand Master convoked a Chapter, which appointed a President of the Electors. He selected a second Elector, these two a third, these three a fourth; and so on, to the number of thirteen; among whom there had to be a Priest, eight Knights, and four other Brethren from four different Provinces, when that was possible. These nineteen elected the Grand Master by a plurality of votes. The Grand Master and Chapter appointed and removed the Grand Officers. Under him were, first, the Bishops, tben the Provincial Masters, each exercising the whole power in his Province, presiding in the Provincial Chap - ters, and seeing that the regulations of the Grand Master and of the Chapters-General were observed. The other officers or Preceptors were five in number; the Grand Com - mander, the Marshal, the Grand Hospitaler, the Draper, and the S~n~chal, or Treasurer. The Grand Commander was originally only the Counselor or Assessor of the Grand Master. Afterward he was ap - pointed to govern in the Grand Master’s absence. In time of peace he had precedence of the Marshal, and convoked the Chapter, when the Master and Sub-Master were absent. He was also called Preceptor. The Marshal had command of the Knights, under the Grand Master, and military command on campaigns. In"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"170 TWENTY-BE VENTH DEGREE. time of war he had precedence over all the other high officers, including the Grand Commander. The Grand Hospitaler had the charge of the poor, and the administration of the Hospitals. The Draper had charge of the clothing, and furnished the Knights with their ordinary and military dress and equipment. The Treasurer or S4n~chal was also the Commissary- General of Supplies. There were also Chatelains or Governors of fortified places, with the Turcopilier and Chaplain. The Turcopilier commanded the light cavalry. In the Teutonic Order, the Marshal appointed him whenever occa - sion required. The Chaplain had charge of the Chapel and its orna - ments; and when the Knights lived, in tents, he regulated the religious services. To distinguish this Order from the other two, they adopted the BLACK Cross. It is ordinarily said that they also adopted the white mantle; but about the year 1210, the Templars of Palestine complained to Pope Innocent, that after they had received from the Holy See the white mantle as the distinctive dress of their Order, the Teu - tonic Knights, and especially those of St. Jean d’Acre, had assumed to wear it. Innocent wrote to the latter, and to their Grand Master, H~nM~ BA.RT, a gentleman of Hoi~ - wrxr~i, and directed them that, in order to avoid all occasion for jealousy or quarrel, they should content themselves with their ordinary dress, and leave the white color to the Templars; and at the same time he ordered the Patriarch of Jerusalem to see to it that the Teutonic Knights should follow their first custom, and to censure and so compel them to do it, if necessary. It is true that they paid little regard to the mandate of the Pope, and soon adopted the white mantle again; but it was not their primitive dress; and therefore we, in this Degree, wear a different color. The leading objects of the three great Military Orders"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"KNIGHT COMMA.NDER OF THE TEMPLE. 171 were the same; and to them was well applied the phrase of the Preacher, the Son of David, the King of Jerusalem, “a three-fold cord is not quickly broken.” The Teutonic Knights soon rivaled the other Orders in nnmbers and influence. In 1223, Herman de Saltza, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, was present at a celebrated assembly convoked by Pope Honorius IlL, at Ferentino in Campania, to deliberate concerning the mode of raising succors for the Holy Land; at which were also present the Pope, the Emperor Frederic IL, of Sicily, John, King of Jerusalem, the Bishop of Bethlehem, the Grand Masters of the Templars and Hospitalers, and other distinguished personages; and it was by the influence of Herman de Saltza, fourth Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, then exercised, that Frederic espoused and married the daughter of the King of Jerusalem, and engaged in a new crusade. In the year 1226 most of the Teutonic Knights went from the Holy Land to Prussia; the people of which were still idolaters, waging cruel war against their Christian neigh - bors, murdering Priests at the foot of the Altar, and em - ploying the sacred vessels for profane uses. Conrad, Duke ofMasovia, called in the Teutonic Knights to his assistance, and gave them, as a commencement for their establishment there, the whole territory of Culm, with all lands they should conquer from the Infidels. ])e Saltza, the Grand Master, sent thither a Knight called Conrad de Lansberg, who concluded the Treaty, which was signed by three bishops of that country. The Knights then entered those northern countries, and by continued wars acquired in time the entire sovereignty of Royal and Ducal Prussia, Livonia, and the Duchies of Courland and Semigal; all vast prov - inces, and capable of forming a great kingdom. And when, in 1291, the Sultan stormed and took St. Jean d’Acre, the Teutonic Knights that survived returned to Europe and joined their Brethren in Prussia and Livonia. In their war against the Heathen of Prussia, it is said, “they got great honor; and the Emperor granting them permission to enjoy what by the sword they had wonne"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"172 TWENTY-SEVENTH DEGREE. with expense of some blood, they purchased great revenues in Prussia, founded Konigsberg, Dantzick, and all the chief towns, and built many illustrious edifices and some cathe - drals, establishing bishops there, who were enjoyned to wear the habit of the Order.” In 1257, Pope Alexander accorded to the Teutonic Order all the indulgences, immunities, and privileges before then granted by the Holy See to the two Houses of the Temple and the Hospital; and this, because it observed with edifi - cation the Statutes of the Hospitalers in regard to the sick poor, and those of the Templars, in what regarded the functions of the Chaplains, Knights, and other persons. “For this reason,” said the Pope, “it is just to make you the equals, in favors and privileges, of those whose virtues and good conduct you zealously strive to imitate.” For many years the Teutonic Knights held Prussia as a fief depending on the Crown of Poland. During this period, fierce contests arose between the Grand Masters of the Order and the Kings of Poland; the former struggling for independence, and the latter obstinately asserting their right of sovereignty. Albert, a Prince of the House of Brandenburg, elected Grand Master in 1511, engaged keenly in the quarrel, and maintained a long war with Sigismund, King of Poland; but adopting the doctrines of Luther, in 1525, he made a treaty with Sigismund, by which that part of Prussia belonging to the Order was erected into a secular and hereditary Duchy, and the investiture of it granted to Albert, who bound himself to do homage for it to the Kings of Poland, as their vassal Immediately afterward he pub - licly professed the Protestant faith, and married a Princess of Denmark The Knights exclaimed so loudly against his treachery that he was put under the ban of the Empire; but he kept possession of the Province he had usurped, and transmitted it to his posterity; and in process of time it fell to the Electoral Branch of the family, all dependence on Poland was shaken off, and the Margraves of Branden - burg took the title of Kings of Prussia; which has thus become one of the leading powers of Europe. I"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"KNIGHT COMMANDEI~ OF THE TEMPLE. 173 The remnant of the Order continued their ancient rule in Franconia, under their newly-elected Grand Master, Albert Wolfgang, and a kind of Order was formed at TJtrecht for Protestants, who were required before admission to pay a certain sum into the fund for charity, and to prove them - selves noble by four generations. After the Order of the Temple had been “suppressed, extinguished, and abolished,” in the year 1312, by the Pa - pal Bull of the 6th May of that year, by which all per - sons were forbidden to enter the Order, or to assume the name of Templars, or to wear their dress, under pain of ex - communication, an extension of the same, in the same year, adjudged all the property and estates of the Templars to the Knights of Rhodes (of St. John, or the Hospitalers, afterward Knights of Malta), except such as were in the realms of Spain, and without prejudice to the rights of any kings, princes, or lords to any property of the Order in other countries. In Germany, all the princes desired to vest the property of the Templars in the Teutonic Order, in order to augment and enrich it, and create great establishments for their chil - dren. They insisted that at least a portion of the property should be adjudged thus, for the reason that it had in part been bestowed on the Templars by their a.zwestors. This demand was made in a tone that permitted no refusal; and the Pope accordingly yielded, and consented to the division. No Templars were executed in Germany; and yet the Order disappeared. History does not tell us what became of the individual members; but as the one Order was but an offshoot of the other, bound to the same service and pro - fessing the same vows, it is easily believed that the ranks of the Teutonic Knights readily opened to receive these im - poverished unfortunates. Connected, like the other mffi - tary Orders, with the Masons, at least as to part of its members, the Teutonic Order privately preserved the title of Knight Commander of the Temple, though the, red man - tle and Black Cross replaced the white mantle and Red Cross of the soldiery of the Temple of Solomon."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"174 TWENTY-SEVENTH DEGREE.

Besides the Master and Warden, whose names you will understand hereafter, there are seven chief dignitaries. You heard their names while making your seven circuits, and receiving their instruction.

On the ban - ners of four of them, stationed in the four corners of the chamber, are the figures, respectively, of the Eagle, the Lion, the Ox, and the Man, which you have so often seen, and probably so little understood, during your progress in Masonry. The number Seven has always been peculiarly sacred. It is composed of the Ternary and Quaternary, or three and four, which are represented by the triangle and the square, and appear in the Ineffable Name of Deity, consisting of but three different letters, one of which being repeated makes the whole number of the letters foni. Adding three to seven, we obtain the sacred number ten, embodied i 11 the Tetractys of Pythagoras, and the number of the Sephiroth or Emanations from the Deity, of the Kabala, themselves subdivided into three and seven, as you will hereafter see. The numbers 3 and 4 are also assigned to the base and per - pendicular of the right-angled triangle in the 47th Problem of Euclid, which is one of the symbols of Blue Masonry; the sum of their squares, ~9 and 16, being equal to 25, the square of the hypothenuse, and 25 being the number of the Degrees of Perfection. * * * * * * THE VISION OF THE LIKENESS OF THE GLORY OF GOD. “A stormy wind from the North, a great cloud, and a flame inlolding it, and aplendor enwrapping it; and out of the fire an amber-colored blaze. “And in the midst of that the likeness of four living creatures, of four Cherubim, each in the form of a man, and each having four faces and four wings, and human hands under their wings on their four sides. “Each of the four had the face of a M~&i.r below; the face of a ThoN on the right, of an Ox on the left, and of an EAGLE above."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE SUN, OR PRINCE ADEPT. 193 “And their wings were extended upward; two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies. “Each Cherub went straight forward; whither the spirit was impelled to go, thither they went; and they turned not as they went. “They resembled blazing coals of fire, and lamps. A bright flame seemed to flash to and fro within the living creatures, and from it lightning coruscating; and the Cherubim went to and fro like flashes of lightning. “By each of the four Cherubim was a wheel, with four faces or sides, and the color of each that of a chrysolite, or sea-green. All were of one fashion, of a wheel in the midst of a wheel. They moved backward or forward, to the right or left, and when they moved, went straight forward. “When the Cherubim went, the wheels went by them; when they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these were lifted up: for the spirit of the Cherubim was in them. “And the whole body of each Cherub, their necks, hands, and wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about. “Over th~ heads of the Cherubim was the likeness of the armament, like crystal, terrible, spread out over their heads above. “And above the irmament, the likeness of a Throne, of the color of a sapphire; and on that a Form like that of a man. The appearance of an amber-colored flame, flowing from Him, enwrapped Him, above and below his loins, as the resemblance of fire encircling him; like a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. “The noise of their wings like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the Most High GOD. “AThrone set in Heaven, and One sitting upon it; One in color like the jasper and sardonyx; and round the Throne an emerald-colored rainbow. “Around the Throne were twenty-four seats; and on the seats twenty-four Ancients sitting, clothed in white, and wearing crowns of gold. “From the Throne issued lightnings, voices, and thun - 13"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"194 TWENTY-EIGHTH DEGREE. derings; and Seven Lamps, that are the Seven Spirits of GOD, burned before the Throne. “In the midst of and round about the Throne, four living creatures, fi~I1 of eyes before and behind; the first like a LION, the second like a Buu~, the third having the face, as it were, of a MAN, and the fourth like an EAGLE flying. “And each of the four living creatures had six wings, and around about and within are full of eyes. “And they rested not day and night, saying, ‘HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, Loiw GOD ALMIGHTY! Who Is all that Was, and Is, and Is to come!’ “And when these living creatures ascribed glory, honor, and blessing to Him Who sitteth on the Throne, the Eter - nal, the twenty-four Ancients fell prostrate before Him that sitteth on the Throne, and adored the Eternal, and cast their crowns before the Throne, saying, ‘Thou art worthy, 0 Loiw our GOD, to receive Glory, and Honor, and Power! because Thou hast created all things, and by Thy Wni all has been made!’ “And Seven Lamps of Fire burning before the Throne; which are the Seven Spirits of THE THEos. “In the midst of the Throne stood a Lamb, as if slain, having Seven horns and Seven eyes, which are the Seven Spirits of mx THEOs, sent forth to all the Earth. “In the midst of the Seven Golden Candlesticks, a Some - what like unto a human being, girt with a golden girdle, and having on His right hand Seven Stars and His countenance shining with a splendor like that of the Sun.” And the Prophet Zechariah speaks of “the Seven eyes of the Loiw, which run to and fro in the whole earth.” * * * * * * Before all things that exist in essence, but not as yet in form, said the old Oriental philosophy, there is one GOD, prior to the first GOD and King, to the first Manifested and Named, remaining immovable in the solitude of His Unity.

Such also was the doctrine of the Kabalah. In it the Ab - solute or Very GOD, has no name, and is simple Unity,’ the essence of unmanifested Light; and so, by the poverty of language, said to be Light itself, or rather that unknown substance and essence, of which Light is the manifestation. * * * * * * The harmony of the Universe, said the Pagan Heracius, like the harmony of a harp, is made up of concords and discords, a mixture of Good and Evil. And Good and Evil, said Euripides, cannot be separated from each other, though they are so tempered as to produce Beauty and Order. To reconcile these with each other, and the liberty and free will of man with the Omnipotence and Foreknowledge of GOD, are the great problems to be solved. Next after ADAM KADMON, said the Kabalists, outfiowed or emanated the ten Sephiroth or Numerations; first, GOD as WILL, above the others, and their source; then from this Unity a second duality of the two sexes, the Divine Wisdom, and its Utterance,Understanding, wherefrom resulted human Intellection or Thinking. Then a third duality, GOD as Jus - tice or Severity, and GOD as Mercy or Benignity, one male, the other female; and from these Harmony or Beauty. Next, GOD as Victory or Success, and as Glory, the fourth duality; from these, Stability or Permanence, the result of Equilib - rium; and from this, Dominion, or the Absolute Supremacy and Sovereignty throughout the Universe, of the will of GOD. * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"196 TWKNTY-EIGHTH DEGREE. ill liii, FV~ * * * * * * * * * * * * LECTURE OF FATHER ADAM. “Then HE, who exists of Himself,” said the Hindu phi - losophy, “the ORIGIN, who is Himself not the object of any perception, He made this world, composed of great ele-. ments, perceptible.

This is “All things,” says the philosophy of the Magi, “and outside of it there is nothing. No substance has issued forth out of absolute nothing. All that is has drawn its origin from the source of eternal Light, from GoD.” The Deity is comprehensible only in His manifestation; the non-manifested is for us an abstraction. He is the no-thing, the Indivisible and Infinite Unity, Ainsoph. He is without bounds, in-no-wise-limited, undefined, formless. This is Anaximander’s To Apeiron, the Buddihists’ Non - Existence, the Chinese Tao. None of these are Per&me; for personality is limitedness, definiteness, bounding. The primitive Light of the Deity, who is nothing, filled all space. it is space itselt All creation has progressively emanated or flowed out from the Divine Light.

For out of his Divine Silence and Rest, after an infinity of Time, was un.folded the Wou,, or the Divine Potency in action; and then in succession the mighty, ever-acting, measureless Divine Intellect; and from the Word were evolved the Suns and Worlds; and Fire and Light, and the Harmony of Spheres and numbers; and from the Intellect all Souls and minds of men.” And the Brahmins said: “In the beginning, the Universe was but one Soul. lifE was the All, alone with Time and Space, and Infinite.” According to Maimonides, the Tsab~ans acknowledged the existence of a Supreme GOD. This mighty and ineffable Being they supposed to dwell in eternal glory, inaccessi - ble and invisible. Innumerable spiritual natures had ema - nated, it was imagined, from the Divine Essence; and these peopled the Universe, and ministered to the Will, as they were instructed by the Wisdom, of the Deity. The Sun and the Stars were first considered as the emblems of the manifestations or self-limitations of GOD, and of the Angels who govern the world, and who preserve the order of nature, under the control of their Omnipotent Sovereign. But, in process of time, as always has happened and always will happen, the types came to be mistaken, first by the common people and then even by their teachers, for the prototypes. The invisible GOD was forgotten, with all the spiritual agents that execute his will, and the Stars and elements themselves were elevated to the rank of Deities. The Ancient Persians adored one eternal Principle of Good, one Eternal beneficent GOD. They said, “He is First, Incorruptible, Eternal, Unbegotten, without parts, unlike to all other beings.” “The Chaldeans,” says a Greek writer, “think there is one Principle of all things;” and Eusebius shows that they acknowledged a First and Supreme Being, the GOD, Father and King of all things. “The Persians,” Thu Shahna says, “after the time of Zoroaster, asserted the existence of GoD the Creator, who"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"KNIGHT OF THE sUN, OR PRINCE ADEPT. 199 was alone, without any companion. He created Light and Darkness; Good and Evil are produced out of the mixture of Light and Darkness; if these were not mixed, the world could not exist; and they will continue so to exist, until they shall be placed in separate worlds appropriated to each. Between the Principle or God of Good, Ormuzd, and Ahriman, the Principle or God of Evil, was Mithras, whom they called the Mediator ;“ thus recognizing the Ternary and the equilibrium of two contraries.

He is the Infinite mind and Supreme Intelligence.” “Wisdom,” say the old Hebrew books, “had flowed forth from Eternity, from the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth.” “When He prepared the Heavens, I was there; when He described a circle in the ocean of light.” And the word rendered ‘Wisdom’ means the Generative Intellectual Potency of Deity. This Wisdom, the daughter of GOD, is also Male and Generator. “She is the out-breathing of the Potency of GOD, and a perfect influence flowing forth from the glory of Omnipotence.~~ “For she is the out-shining of the Eternal Light, the perfect mirror of the Power of GOD, and the image of His Beneficence.” “He has formed earth by his Power, and established it by His Wisdom, and stretched out the Heavens by His Understanding.” Such were the ancient ideas in regard to Deity. * * * * * * The Sun approaches the West... * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"~x~ioaa HLNIN~AJ~N~M~L"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"xxIx GRAND SCOTTISH KNIGHT OF SAINT ANDREW. .1 J•~ ~‘‘ THE CHAPTKB, ITS DECORATIONS, ETC.

HISTORY. When the Order of The K7ziqhthood of the Temple of Solo - mon~, or of The K7dqMs of the Temple, the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Jesus Christ, which was established in 1118, had been de - clared heretical by Pope Clement V., at the instance of Philip the Fair of France, in 1307; when all of the Order in France had been arrested and imprisoned, many ex - ecuted, more tortured, and all impoverished; when, in most of the other European States, the Estates of the Order had been confiscated and divided between the Sove - reign, the Knights Hospitalers, and the Pope; and when the Grand Master and the Grand Preceptor Guy had been burned alive, on the 18th of March, 1313, Old Style; the Templars no longer had a common head, nor could any - where maintain their organization under their old name, which had become so famous. Their possessions confiscated, their leaders incarcerated for life or put to death, the Brethren persecuted in every way, the survivors were compelled, for the sake of conceal - ment, and to be in safety, to leave their homes, lay aside the garb of the Temple, and mingle again with the world, or enter other Orders. In Portugal, where they were pro - nounced innocent, the name of the Order was changed to that of the Order of CHRIST. In England King Edward proscribed them, and forbade them to remain in the realm, unless they entered the Commanderies of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, or of the HospitaL In Scotland they found protection, and joined the army with which King Robert Bruce met the invasion of his country by Edward II. of England. The battle of Bannockburn was fought on the 24th of June, 1314. In consequence of the assistance rendered him on that memorable day by the Templars, Bruce created, and received them into, the Order of Saint Andrew du Chardon [of the Thistle], of Scotland. This was afterward annexed to the Degrees of the Rite of Heredom, Herodom, or Hie - rodom, a word coined from the two Greek words ~Iepo~"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"GRAND SCOTI’ISH KNIGHT OF SAINT kNDREW. 213 Ad,uo~ [Theros domos], HOLY HOUSE, and said to be the name of a mountain in Scotland (where there is no such mountain), to conceal the real name of the Order, which was “Tnx HOLY HousE of the T~mE at Jerusalem.” The meaning hid - den in the word “HOLY” you may, perhaps, be hereafter fortunate enough to learn. King Robert reserved to himself and to his successors forever the title of Grand Master of the new Order; and granted a charter of lands to Walter de Clifton, Grand Pre - ceptor of the Templars for Scotland, for the assistance which they rendered him at Bannockburn. Prince Charles Edward Stuart was the last Grand Master of the Order of Herodom in Scotland, and exercised his powers in France, by establishing a Chapter of Rose Croix at A.rras, and by other acts. And when the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite was finally organized, by those in possession of the Degrees of the Rites of Herodom and Perfection, and of other Rites and detached Degrees that had been from time to time established in Scotland, France, Germany, and elsewhere, the Order of Grand Scottish Knights of Saint Andrew became the 29th of the new Rite, formed by selecting, from the different Rites and Obser - vances, seven Degrees, in addition to the twenty-five of Per - fcction; and creating the 33d, as the Supreme and last Degree, to rule the whole.

But this election did not take place till after the funeral. Should the death of the Master have occurred in the province of Tripolis, or that of Antioch, the Prior of the Province took the direction of the Order, till the Great Prior was appointed. Owing to the constant state of war which prevailed in the East, and to other causes, a considerable space of time occasionally in - tervened between the death of one Master and the appointment of his successor. During the interregnum, the society was di - rected by the Great Prior, who bore the seal of the Master. When the day appointed for the election was arrived, the Great Officers of the Order, and all the bailiffs who were invited to be present, assembled in the place selected for holding the election—generally the Chapel of the Order. The Great Prior, taking several of the Knights aside, consulted with them; and they then made two, or three, or more of the Knights who were most highly esteemed retire. The Great Prior took the voices of those present on the merits of the absent Knights, and he who had most in his favor was declared the Electing Prior. The Knights were then called in, and the choice of the assembly no - tified to them. A Knight possessing the same virtues of piety, love of peace, and impartiality with himself, was then assigned for an assistant to the Electing Prior, and the whole assembly withdrew, leaving the two alone in the chapel, where they passed the rest of the night in prayer. Early next morning, after performing their usual devotion, and hearing the Mass of the Holy Ghost, the Chapter re-assem - bled. The Great Prior then exhorted the two Electing Brethren to perform their duty truly and honestly. These, then retiring, chose two other Brethren; these four chose two more, and so on, till the number amounted to twelve, in honor of the Apostles. The twelve then chose a Brother Chaplain to represent the per - son of Jesus Christ, and maintain peace and concord. It was necessary that these thirteen should be of different Provinces— eight of the Knights, four serving Brethren, and one Priest. The thirteen Electors then returned to the Chapter, and the Electing Prior besought all present to pray for them, as a great task had been laid on them. All then fell on their knees and prayed, and the Great Prior solemnly reminded the Electors"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"GRAND 5C0T1ISE KNIGHT OF SAINT ANDREW. 215 of their duty, and conjured them to perform it truly and up.. rightly. Having again implored the prayers of the assembly, The Electing Prior and his companions retired to the place appointed for their deliberations. If the Electors, or the majority ~f them, declared for any Knight on this or the other side of the sea, he was appointed; if they were divided into parties, -the Electing Prior came with one of the Knights, and, informing the assembly of the circumstance, asked their prayers. All fell on their knees, and the two Electors returned to their companions; if they now agreed, the person whom they chose was declared Master. Should the object of their choice be, as was not unfrequently the case, actually present in the Chapter, the thirteen came in. And the Electing Prior, speaking in their name, said: “Be - loved Sirs, give praise and thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to our dear Lady, and to all the Saints, that we are agreed, and have, according to your command, chosen, in the name of God, a Master of the Temple. Are ye content with what we have done?” All then replied, “In the name of God.” “Do ye promise to yield him obedience as long as he lives ?“ “Yea, with the help of God.” The Electing Prior then returned to the Great Prior, and said: “Prior, if God and we have chosen thee for the Master, wilt thou promise to obey the Chapter as long as thou livest, and to maintain the good morals and good usages of the Order ?“ And he answered, “Yea, with the aid of God.” The same question was then put to some of the most distinguished Knights, and if the person elected was present, the Electing Prior went up to him, and said: “In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, we have chosen you, Brother N. N., for Master, and do choose you.” He then said: “Beloved Sirs and Brethren, give thanks unto God; behold our Master.” The Chaplains then chaunted aloud the Te Deum Laudamus; the Brethren arose, and with the utmost reverence and joy, taking the new Master in their arms, carried him into the chapel, and placed him before the altar, where he continued kneeling while the Brethren prayed; the Chaplains repeating Kyrie Elei8on, Paler Nosier, and other devotional forms. The election of the Master of the Temple required no Papal confirmation: the choice of the Chapter was conclusive. Two Knights were assigned to him as his companions."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"216 TwENTy-Nnq’rH DEGREE. The following account of the reception of a Knight is highly interesting Whoever presented himself to be received as a Knight of the Order must solemnly aver that he was sprung from a Knightly family, and that his father was, or might have been, a Knight. He was further to prove that he was born in lawful wedlock; for, like the Church in general, the Templars excluded bastards from their society. It was necessary that the candidate for admission among the Knights of the Temple should already be a Knight; for as Knighthood was a secular honor, the Order would have regarded it as derogatory from its dignity if any of its members were to receive it. The Hospitalers and Teutonic Knights thought differently. With them the Aspirant was knighted on his admission. If the candidate Templar, therefore, had not been knighted, he was obliged to receive Knighthood, in the usual manner, from a secu - lar Knight, or a Bishop, previous to taking his vows. A novitiate forms an essential and reasonable part of the course of admission into the spiritual orders in general; for it is but right that a person should become in some measure acquainted with the rules and duties of ‘a society before he enters it. But, though the original rules of the Templars enjoined a novitiate, it was totally neglected in practice; a matter which was after - wards made one of the charges against the Order. The reception of a Knight took place in one of the assembled Chapters of the Order, in the presence of the assembled Chapter. It was secret, not even the relatives of the Candidate being allowed to be present. The ceremony commenced by the Master or Prior who presided, saying, “Beloved Brethren, ye see that the majority are agreed to receive this man as a Brother. If there be any among you who knows anything of him, on account of which he cannot lawfully become a Brother, let him say it, for it is better that this should be signified beforehand .than after he is brought before us.” The Aspirant, if no objection was made, was then led into a chamber near the Chapter-room; and two or three reputable Knights, of the oldest in the house, were sent to lay before him what it was needful for him to know. They commenced by saying, “Brother, are you desirous of being associated to the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"GRAND SCOTTISH KNIGHT OF 5Afl~T ANDREw. 217 Order ?“ If he answered in the affirmative, they stated to him the whole rigor of the Order. Should he reply that he was willing to endure everything for the sake of God, and to be all his life long the servant and slave of the Order, they asked him if he had a wife, or was betrothed? If he had made profession or vows in any other Order? If he owed to any man in the world more than he could pay? If he was of sound body, and had no secret infirmity, and if he was the servant of any one? Should his answers be in the negative, the Brethren went back to the Chapter, and informed the Master or his representative of the result of the examination.. The latter then asked once more if any one knew anything to the contrary; if all were silent, he said :—“ Are you willing that he should be brought in, in God’s name?” The Knights then said, “Let him be brought in, in God’s name.” Those who had been already with him then went out again, and asked him if he persisted in his resolution I If he said that he did, they instructed him in what he was to do when suing for admission. They then led him back to the Chapter, where, casting himself on his knees, with folded hands before the Receptor, he said, “Sir, I am come before God, and before you and the Brethren, and pray and beseech you for the sake of God and our dear Lady Mary, to admit me into your Society, and the good deeds of the Order, as one who will be all his life long the servant and slave of the Order.” The Receptor then replied, “Beloved Brother, you are desirous of a great matter, for you see nothing but the outward shell of our Order. It is only the outward shell when you see that we have fine horses and rich caparisons, that we eat and drink well, and are splendidly clothed. From this you conclude that you will be well off with us. But you know not the rigorous maxims which are in our interior. For it is a hard matter for you, who are your own master, to become the servant of another. You will hardly be able to perform in future what you wish yourself. For when you may wish to be on this side of the sea, you will be sent to the other side; when you wish to be in Acre, you will be sent to the district of Antioch, to Tripolis, or to Armenia, or you will be sent to Apulia, to Sicily, or to Lombardy, or to Burgundy, France, England, or any other country where we have houses or possessions; when you wish to sleep you will be ordered to watch; when you will wish to watch, then you will be ordered"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"218 TWENTY-NINTH DEGREE. to bed; when you will wish to eat, then you will be ordered to do something else. And as both we and you might suffer great inconvenience from what you have mayhap concealed from us, look here on the Holy Evangelists and the Word of God, and answer the truth to the questions which we shall put to you; for if you lie you will be perjured, and may be expelled the Order, from which God keep you.” He was now asked over again by the Preceptor the same ques - tions as before, and moreover if he had made any simoniacal contract with a Templar or any other for admission. If his answers proved satisfactory, the Preceptor proceeded, “Beloved Brother, take good care that you have spoken the truth to us, for should you have spoken false in any one point, you might be put out of the Order, from which God keep you; now, beloved Brother, attend strictly to what we shall say unto you. Do you promise to God and our dear Lady Mary, to be all your life long obedient to the Master of the Temple, and to the Prior who shall be set over you ? “—“ Yea, Sir, with the help of Go&” “Do you promise to God and our dear Lady Mary, to live chaste of your body all your life long ? “—“ Yea, Sir, with the help of God.” “Do you promise to God and our dear Lady Mary, to observe all your life long the laudable manners and customs of our Order, both those which are already in use, and those which the Master and Knights may add ? “—“ Yea, Sir, with the help of Go&” “Do you promise to God and our dear Lady Mary, that you will, with the strength and powers which God has bestowed on you, help as long as you live to conquer the holy land of Jerusa - lem; and that you will, with all your strength, aid to keep and guard that which the Christians possess ? “—“ Yea, Sir, with the help of God.” “Do you promise to God, and our dear Lady Mary, never to hold this Order for stronger or weaker, for better or worse, than with the permission of the Chapter, which has the authority?” —“Yea, Sir, with the help of Go&” “Do you finally promise to God and our dear Lady Mary, never to be present when a Christian is unjustly and unlawfully de - spoiled of his heritage, and that you will never, by counsel or by act, take part therein ? “—“ Ye% Sir, with the help of God.” “In the name, then, of God and our dear Lady Mary, and in"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"GRAND SCOTTISH KNIGHT OF 5Afl~T ANDREW. 219 the name of St. Peter of Rome, and of our father the Pope, and in the name of all the Brethren of the Temple, we receive you to all the good works of the Order, which have been performed from the beginning, and shall be performed to the end of you, your father, your mother, and all of your family whom you will let have share therein. In like manner do you receive us to all the good works which you have performed and shall perform. We assure you of bread and water, and of the poor clothing’ of the Order, and labor and toil enow.” The Master then took the distingnishing habit of the Order— namely, the white mantle, with the red cross, and putting it about the neck of the candidate, clasped it firmly. The Chap - lain then repeated the 132d Psalm, Ecce quam bonum, and the prayer of the Holy Ghost, Deus qui corda fidelium, and each Brother repeated a Paler-Nosier. The Master and the Chaplain then kissed him on the mouth, and he sat down before the Mas - ter, who delivered to him a discourse, of which the following is the substance :—He was not to strike or wound any Christian; not to swear; not to receive any attendance from a woman with - out the permission of his superior; not on any account to kiss a woman, even if she was his mother or his sister; to hold no child at the baptismal font, or be a godfather; to abuse no man, or call him foul names; but to be always courteous and polite. He was to sleep in a linen shirt, drawers, and hose, and girded with a small girdle. He was to attend Divine Service punctually, and at table he was to commence and conclude with prayer. During the meal he was to preserve silence. When the Master died he was, be where he might, to repeat 200 Pater-Nosters for the repose of his soul. Each Knight was supplied with clothes, arms, and equipments out of the funds of the Order. His dress was a long white tunic, nearly resembling that of priests in shape, with.:a red cross on the back and top of it; his girdle was under this, over his linen shirt. Over all he wore his white mantle, with its red cross of four arms (the under one being the longest) on the left breast. His head was covered by a cap or hood attached to his mantle. His arms were shield, lance, sword, and mace; and owing to the heat of the East, and the necessity of activity in combats with the Turks and Saracens, his arms and equipments, in general, were lighter than those used by the secular knights. He was"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"220 TWE~TY-~INTH DEGREE. t allowed three horses and an esquire, who was either a serving brother of the Order, or some layman, who was hired for the purpose. The reception of the Clergy (first admitted 1162) was the same as that of the Knights, with the omission of such questions as did not apply to them. They were only required to take the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The ritual of their reception was in Latin, and was almost precisely the same with that of the Benedictines. Like that of the Knights, their recep - tion was secret. When the Psalms had been sung, the Master put on the Recipient the dress of the Order and the girdle, and if he was a Priest, the cap called baret. The habit of the Chaplain of the Order was a white, close-fitting tunic, with a red cross on the left breast. The reception of the serving brethren was the same as that of the two higher classes, the necessary difference being made in the questions which were asked. As the Order would receive no slave into their body, the candidate was required to aver that he was a freeborn man; he was moreover obliged to declare that he was not a Knight. As the more disagreeable duties of the Order probably fell to their share, the general duties and obligations were laid before them in stronger and more explicit terms than were thought necessary in the case of Knights and Priests. In the times of the poverty of the Order, the clothing of the serving brethren of the Order was the cast-off garments of the Knights, but this custom did not long continue; and as some abuses arose from all the members of the Order being clad in white, the serv - ing brethren were appointed to wear black or brown kirtles, with the red cross upon them, to indicate that they belonged to the Order. In battle their arms were nearly the same as the Knights, but of a lighter kind, as they had frequently to jump from their horses and fight on foot. They were allowed but one horse by the Order, but the Master was empowered to lend each another, if he thought it expedient, which horse was to be afterwards returned. * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"GRiND ScOTrISH LNIGHT OP SAINT ANDREW. 221 LECTURE. * * * * * 0 TO CLOSE. * * * * * * • The nght draws near; . .. . . and with the same swift step approach the night of Death and the hour of Judgment * * * * * * O.•.

The middle one, 15 225"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"226 THIRTIETH DEGREE. wreathed with laurel and amaranths (immorlelles), lies on a black velvet cushion. Upon the one on the left is the triple crown of the Pope, and on the one on the right a regal crown, adorned with fleurs de lys, and open, like those of the middlo age. At the west end of the apartment is a large transparency, on which appears, in flame-colored letters, the following sentence: “HE WHO SHALL OVERCOME THE DREAD OF DEATH SHALL ASCEND ABOVE THE TERRESTRIAL SPHERE, AND BE ENTITLED TO INITIATION INTO THE GREATER MYSTERIES.” Under this are the initials t~j .~. .~.

Above and between the two altars hangs a double-headed eagle, one half white, and the other black, with his wings extended. He should be as life-like as possible. THE THIRD APARTMENT.. . . is hung with light-blue; the ceil - ing blue and starry. The apartment is divided into two parts by a curtain, midway between the entrance and the East. In the East is a platform, the ascent to which is by seven steps. On the platform are seven seats, one in the middle, to the rear, for the Supreme Judge, and three on each side, facing inward, for the Frank-Judges. Over the Supreme Judge a crimson curtain divides, and hangs down to the floor on each side of the plat - form, like a tent. Over the Supreme Judge leans the Banner of the Order, or the Beauseant, which is as represented below.

On the East, North, and South sides of the Altar, are three candlesticks, one on each side, and each with three branches. In each branch burns a candle of yellow wax ; and the candlesticks are covered with black crape. THE FOURTH APARTMENT.... is hung with crimson, except the East, and adorned with white columns. The East is hung, at the back and sides, with black velvet, embroidered with silver, displaying skulls pierced with daggers. Over the Throne hangs an imitation of a large double-headed white and black eagle, his wings open but not fully spread, hold - ing a sword in his claws. Round his neck is a ribbon, half black and half white, from which hangs a patriarchal cross of three transverse bars, carved of wood and gilded. Between the wings of the eagle, heavy drapery of black velvet, with large white stripes and silver fringe, falls down and forms hangings for the Throne on either side. On the black stripes are red Teutonic Crosses and five-pointed silver stars. Behind the Throne is a large Teutonic Cross, of the pattern hereafter described. On the right of the Throne leans the Beauseant. In the West, on the right hand, leans the white banner, and on the left, the black banner of the Order. Toward the west of the hail is a large Mausoleum, in the shape of a truncated pyramid, painted to imitate black marble. On the platform of it is a funereal urn, covered with a black vail. This is encircled by a wreath of laurel. On the right of the urn is a regal CROWN; on the left, a Pope’s TIARA. At each angle is a vase, in which alcohol burns; and there are two or three small pans, in which is incense, to be lighted at the proper time. Between the East and the Mausoleum is the Mysterious Lad - der,, covered, until the proper moment, by a black cloth. Over the West is a transparency representing De Molai burn - ing at the stake. Over him are the words, “Dieu le Veut: SPES MEA IN DEO EST.” In the East, are a Roman Cap of Liberty and a Shepherd’s Crook Between the Mausoleum and the West is the Altar, on which"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"228 THIRTIETH DEGREE. are a skull containing a silver cup, a decanter of red wine, and a loaf of ~white bread; all of which is covered by a white linen cloth, to be removed at the proper time. On each side of the Mausoleum stands a Herald-at-Arms, in full armor, gauntleted, and with sword, battle-axe, casque, and visor. On each side, to the front, of each of the three first officers, is a light; and round the Altar are ten thus arranged: on the East side one, its color light-blue; on the North side two, their color black; on the West side three, forming an equilateral triangle, their color white; and on the South side four, forming a square, their color bright red.

It was useless to demand that you should lament his death, as you lament in pain and agony the departure of those who have been near and dear to you. It is equally useless to ask you so to lament the death of the martyr whose memory we here honor. After a little while we cease to feel the sharp pangs of sorrow, even for those that we have loved the most; such are the healing influences of Time. The pages of the world’s history are studded all over with the names of martyrs. In every age and every year, Tyranny, Fanaticism, and ignorant Brutality have had their victims. untimely deaths are of daily occurrence. Ships burn or founder at sea, and boats burn or sink upon great rivers. Trains running at lightning speed crash together and crush out life from, hundreds of mutilated bodies. With shot and sabre war never ceases to destroy its thou - sands; and human life is too cheap in this age of agitation and excitement for one to pause in order to lament the death of a single person who died hundreds of years ago. And if such grief were possible, why not also, if not much rather, mourn for the death of Socrates, to whose lips an ungrateful city held the cup ot hemlock? or of Seneca the philosopher, ordered by Nero to slay himself? or of old Coligni, his gray hairs dabbled with blood on the eve of Saint Bartholomew? or of Russell, judicially murdered, to the eternal shame of England? of More, the innocent victim of a tyrant? or of Servetus, the sacrifice of fanaticism? of the Apostles, Saints, and Martyrs, crucified, beheaded, burned? of the thousand eminent victims, in every age of the world, of the despot’s suspicion and cowardice, the priest’s intolerance, the noble’s rapacity, the cruelty and ingratitude of the mob?

The Liberator generally becomes the Auto - crat, not because he intended it, or was ambitious, but because he wearies of the work in hand, and finds the peo - ple unwilling to be free.

If you initiate one, no mat - ter how wise and necessary, if you attempt to eradicate an error or correct an abuse, you are met with sneers here, apathy and coldness there, opposition on one side, predictions of failure on the other, stupid adherence to old stupid routine on the part of some, envy and jealousy on the part of others, because your movement does not come from them. Consider it settled at the beginning, that if you benefit men at all, it must be against their will; that it is always more difficult to force education, enlightenment, or freedom on them, than, it is to deprive them of their rights; that they cling to old errors and antiquated creeds, that are on the point of tumbling about their ears, with a tenacity like that with which they cling to life; and that when you endeavor to right and elevate them, you are more likely to be hated as an enemy than loved as a friend, and to fall a martyr to your philanthropy than to be crowned as a benefactor. g the refore, you would do anything worth doing, you must be patient.

The ig- norant man is blind, goes staggering all his life in the dark, serves Imposture and Tyranny, bears the biardens they im - pose on him, and is ever ready to be their instrument to enslave his Brethren, and to remove out of the way of his Masters those who seek to elevate the enslaved above their present condition. Knowledge is power. The world has at least learned that. You conclude that, in this Degree, the words on the seven steps of the ladder mean something more and higher than the mere elementary sciences of which they are the names. You are right; for while an acquaintance with the rules of Grammar and with Arithmetic are mere ordinary acquire - ments, taught in the cheapest schools to boys, one may be a logician without studying logic; there are but a few emi - nent astronomers in the world; and musicians and rheto - ricians are not particularly public benefactors. One may be a true Knight Kadosh, as he may be a statesman, an orator, an advocate, without studying logic or rhetoric at all, and certainly without being an adept in Music, Geometry, or Astronomy. The seven Sciences of Pythagoras would not now be named as constituting the circle of human knowledge. Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, and Arithmetic are dethroned as Sciences, and have become but the preparatory studies of youth in schools and academies; while Geometry, Music, and Astronomy have made such advances, that to attain eminence in either demands the whole of a man’s time and life. New Sciences, unknown to the ancients, Geology, Botany, Chemistry, Physics, Dynamics, now constitute the principal steps of the Great Temple of Knowledge. Still, there are profound meanings involved in the names of the seven ancient Sciences, and they are by no means used in this Degree in the ordinary sense, nor as they are understood by the mere Fellow-Craft. * * * * * * G1~MM~u~ is the wonderful gift and science of accurately ________________________________"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"KNIGHT KADO8~ 249 communicating to other minds, through the medium of the ear or eye, by language or writing, the thoughts that come into our own mind, and of so recording them with exact accuracy, by symbolic characters that conventionally repre - sent them, as that these characters shall always recall to us and others the self-same thoughts and ideas, with all their more delicate shades and colorings. It, therefore, this science of aceurate communication of ideas, is the first step toward knowledge, toward the formation of society and social relations, toward law, contracts, business, and phi - losophy. * * * * * * RHETORIC is a mercenary Soldier, that takes wages on any side; as frequently to maintain hoary abuses and old usur - pations, to gild and gloze over vice, defend wrong, and make the worse appear the better reason, as to advocate reform, commend and protect virtue, and vindicate the Right; and there is a bastard Logic, called Sophistry, much more common than Logic itself, a cunning juggler, that dexterously plays with words, misleads, and cheats the understanding; and into which men often fall through mere pride in their intellectual powers and acuteness.

The most important of all things to them would be the regular return of spring. Certain numbers would thus become partic~rilarly noticeable. There are seven stars of Ursa Major, six of the Pleiades, five of the Hyades, three in the belt of Orion. The year of twelve moons, each of four weeks, would give them for each week the same number seven. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, would make the number 5 sacred. Geometrical figures, the circle, point, triangle, five-pointed star, the cube, the triple-triangle, the seal of Solomon, the three squares of the 47th prob - lem, would soon become symbols of the mysterious num - bers. Hence the idea of “intellectual numbers,” existing in the Deity before anything was created, of numbers as unconnected with any object, and having in themselves a peculiar virtue and potency, of which so much was said in the philosophy of Pythagoras, whereof, and of the sacred numbers, you may learn more hereafter. * * * * * * The Science of Mathematics, applied to the earth, which appeared to be and was supposed to be a great flat level, with occasional inequalities, was termed GEOMETRY. The world, with the stars and other heavenly bodies, that seemed made only to minister to it, became a great machine, subjected to and governed by certain mere mechanical forces, laws of unerring accuracy, imposed upon it by Omnipotence. These laws, and that mechanical, unvarying accuracy of movement, demonstrated the existence of a single Omnipotent Will; and thus men arrived at the con - viction that there was a Supreme Architect, or Builder, of the Universe, the infinitely ingenious maker of an infi-. nitely complicated machine, the infinite Clock-maker. * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"KNIGHT KADOSH. 251 Therefore men began to see, in the revolutions of the spheres, all arranged so as never to interfere with each other; in the alternation of the seasons, and of the hours for rest and labor, in the mystery of generation and birth, in the phenomena of growth, something more than the exercise of mechanical skill on the part of the Creator. They found that musical notes proceeded by octaves and were connected with, and could be represented by, num - bers; they connected all musical sounds in nature with one universal harmony, and imagined that the spheres, revolv - ing in their orbits, made exquisite Music; and they thought that the law which made their movement eternal was not two opposing mechanical forces, but One law of HARMONY, in which something more than the mechanical genius of the Deity played a part, and wa8 the lawgiver. * * * * * * O.. Still no sufficient motive was assigned, why the Deity, after an eternity of immobility, during which He had been alone with Time and Space, silent, speechless, and inactive as they, should have been impelled to create; nor any in its nature so permanent as to give us guarantee that He might not at any moment become weary of His work and annul it, when it should no longer give Him pleasure; nor any, indeed, at all consistent with the loftiness and infinity of His perfection. Surely the gTatification arising from the exercise of an even infinite mechanical skill and inventive capacity, was not so; nor could the contemplation of the BmOoth and accurate working of a mere machine long give Him pleasure. And though of higher degree, the mere sen - 8ua1 delight which Harmony could give would be in its nature the same. It is only in part intellectual, and in no degree moral.

Everywhere he saw iVe, rioting in en - joyment; everywhere something adapted and designed to minister to the enjoyment of some living thing. With eyes unsealed, he studied again the great pages of the Book of Nature, and sought to read the thought of the Creator, written indelibly there, and to discover the motive for crea - tion, and the great law of the Universe: in the wondrous profusion displayed by the Almighty, and in the stars, thick as the leaves of great forests in the spring-time; in air, earth, and water, teeming with life; in the greenness of the earth, and the azure of the sky, in everything within him and without, he discovered that motive, and that Law,— the motive, infinite Beneficence; the Law, infinite Love; and he saw that, as the time never was when GoD was not, so the time never was when GOD was alone, with nought to love and care for, and when He had not created the Uni - verse.

We often profit more by our enemies than by our friends. “We 8Upport ourselves only on that which resists,” and owe our I success to opposition. The best friends of Masonry in America were the Anti-Masons of 1826, and at the same time they were its worst enemies. Men are but the automata of Providence, and it uses the demagogne, the fanatic, and the knave, a common trinity in republics, as its tools and in - struments, to effect that of which they do not dream, and which they imagine themselves commissioned to prevent. The Anti-Masons, traitors and perjurers some, and some mere political knaves, purified Masonry by persecution, and so proved to be its benefactors; for that which is persecuted, grows. To them its present popularity is due, the cheap - ening of its Degrees, the invasion of its Lodges, that are no longer Sanctuaries, by the multitude; its pomp and pa - geantry and overdone display. An hundred years ago it had become known that the were the Templars under a vail, and therefore the De - gree was proscribed, and, ceasing to be worked, became a mere brief and formal ceremony, under another name. Now, from the tomb in which after his murders he rotted, Clem - ent the Fifth howls against the successors of his victims, in the Allocution of Pio Kono against the Freemasons.

It is a declaration of war, and was needed to arouse apaLhy and inertness to action. An enemy of the Templars shall tell us the secret of this Papal hostility against an Order that has existed for centu - ries in despite of its anathemas, and has its Sanctuaries and Asyla even in Rome. It will be easy, as we read, to separate the false from the true, the audacious conjectures from the simple facts. “A Power that ruled without antagonism and without concurrence, and consequently without control, proved fatal to the Sacerdotal Royalties; while the Republics, on the other hand, had perished by the conflict of liberties and franchises which, in the absence of all duty hierarchically sanctioned and enforced, had soon become mere tyrannies, rivals one of the other. To find a stable medium between these two abysses, the idea of the Christian Hierophants was to create a society devoted to abnegation by solemn vows, protected by severe regulations; which should be re - cruited by initiation, and which, sole depositary of the great religious and social secrets, should make Kings and Pon - tiffs, without exposing it to the corruptions of Power. In that was the secret of that kingdom of Jesus Christ, which, without being of this world, would govern all its grandeu.rs. “This idea presided at the foundation of the great re - ligious orders, so often at war with the secular authorities, ecclesiastical or civil Its realization was also the dream of the dissident sects of Gnostics or Illuminati, who pretended to connect their faith with the primitive tradition of the Christianity of SaintJohn. It at length became a menace for the Church and Society, when a rich and dissolute Order, initiated in the mysterious doctrines of the Kabalah, seemed disposed to turn against legitimate authority the conserva - tive principles of Hierarchy, and threatened the entire world with an immense revolution. “The Templars, whose history is so imperfectly known, were those terrible conspirators. In 1118, nine Knights Crusaders in the East, among whom were Geoffroi de Saint~.

The avowed object of the Templars was to protect the Christians who came to visit the Holy Places: their secret object was the rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon on the model prophesied by Ezekiel. “This rebuilding, formally predicted by the JudaYzing Mystics of the earlier ages, had become the secret dream of the Patriarchs of the Orient. The Temple of Solomon, rebuilt and consecrated to the Catholic worship, would be - come, in effect, the Metropolis of the Universe; the East would prevail over the West, and the Patriarchs of Constan - tinople would possess themselves of the Papal power. “The Templars, or Poor Fellow-Soldiery of the Holy House of ike Temple, intended to be rebuilt, took as their models, in the Bible, the Warrior-Masons of Zorobabel, who worked, holding the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other. Therefore it was that the Sword and the Trowel were the insignia of the Templars, who subsequently, as will be seen, concealed themselves under the name of Brethren-Masons.

There existed at that period in the East a Sect of Johannite Christians, who claimed to be the only true initiates into the real mysteries of the religion of the Saviour. They pretended to know the real history of YESUS the ANOINTED, and adopting in part the Jewish tra - ditions and the tales of the Talmud, they held that the facts recounted in the Evangels are but allegories, the key of which Saint John gives, in saying that the world might be filled with the books that could be written upon the words and deeds of Jesus Christ; words which, they thought, would be only a ridiculous exaggeration, if he were not speaking of an allegory and a legend, that might be varied and pro - longed to infinity. “The Johannites ascribed to Saint John the foundation of their Secret Church, and the Grand Pontiffs of the Sect assumed the title of Christos, Anointed, or Consecrated, and claimed to have succeeded one another from Saint John by an uninterrupted succession of pontifical powers. He who, at the period of the foundation of the Order of the Temple, claimed these imaginary prerogatives, was named THEo - CLET; he knew HUGUES DE PAYENS, he initiated him into the mysteries and hopes of his pretended church, he seduced him by the notions of Sovereign Priesthood and Supreme Royalty, and finally designated him as his successor. “Thus the Order of Knights of the Temple was at its very origin devoted to the cause of opposition to the tiara of Rome and the crowns of Kings, and the Apostolate of Kabalistic Gnosticism was vested in its chiefs. For Saint John himself was the Father of the Gnostics, and the cur - rent translation of his polemic against the heretical of his Sect and the Pagans who denied that Christ was the Word, is throughout a misrepresentation, or misunderstand - ing at least, of the whole Spirit of that EvangeL “The tendencies and tenets of the Order were enveloped in profound mystery, and it externally professed the most perfect orthodoxy. The Chiefs alone knew the aim of the Order: the Subalterns followed them without distrust."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"KNIGHT KADOsH. 259 “To acquire influence and wealth, then to intrigue, and at need to fight, to establish the Johannite or Gnostic and Kabalistic dogma, were the object and means proposed to the initiated Brethren. The Papacy and the rival Mon - archies, they said to them, are sold and bought in these days, become corrupt, and to-morrow, perhaps, will destroy each other. All that will become the heritage of the Temple: the World will soon comb to us for its Sovereigns and Pon - tiffs. We shall constitute the equilibrium of the Universe, and be rulers over the Masters of the World. “The Templars, like all other Secret Orders and Associa - tions, had two doctrines, one concealed and reserved for the Masters, which was Johannism; the other public, which was the Roman Catholic. Thus they deceived the adversa - ries whom they sought to supplant. Hence Freemason - ry, vulgarly imagined to have begun with the Dionysian A.rchitects or the German Stone-workers, adopted Saint John the Evangelist as one of its patrons, associating with him, in order not to arouse the suspicions of Rome, Saint John the Baptist, and thus covertly proclaiming itself the child of the Kabalah and Essenism together.” [For the Johannism of the Adepts was the Kabalah of the earlier Gnostics, degenerating afterward into those heretical forms which Gnosticism developed, so that even Manes had his followers among them. Many adopted his doctrine of the two Principles, the recollection of which is perpetuated by the handle of the dagger and the tesselated pavement or floor of the Lodge, stupidly called “the Indent - ed Tessd,” and represented by great hanging tassek, when it really means a tesserated floor (from the Latin tessera) of white and black lozenges, with a necessarily denticulated or tndented border or edging. And wherever, in the higher Degrees, the two colors, white and black, are in juxtaposition, the two Principles of Zarathustra and Manes are alluded to. With others the doctrine became a mystic Pantheism, descended from that of the Brahmans, and even pushed to an idolatry of Nature and hatred of every revealed dogma. [To all this the absurd reading of the established Church, I"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"260 THIRTIETH DEGREE. taking literally the figurative, allegorical, and mythical lan - guage of a collection of Oriental books of different ages, directly and inevitably led. The same result long after fol - lowed the folly of regarding the Hebrew books as if they had been written by the unimaginative, hard, practical in - tellect of the England of James the First, and the bigoted stolidity of Scottish Presbyterianism.] “The better to succeed and win partisans, the Templars sympathized with regrets for dethroned creeds, and encour - aged the hopes of new worships, promising to all liberty of conscience and anew orthodoxy that should be the synthe - sis of all the persecuted creeds.” [It is absurd to suppose that men of intellect adored a monstrous idol called Baphomet, or recognized Muhammed as an inspired prophet. Their symbolism, invented ages before, to conceal what it was dangerous to avow, was, of course, misunderstood by those who are not Adepts, and to their enemies seemed to be pantheistic. The calf of gold, made by Aaron for the Israelites, was but one of the oxen under the layer of bronze, and the Karobim on the Propi - tiatory, misunderstood. The symbols of the wise always become the idols of the ignorant multitude. What the Chiefs of the Order really believed and taught, is indicated to the Adepts by the hints contained in the high Degrees of Freemasonry, and by the symbols which only the Adepts understand. [The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpre - tations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry. The whole body of the Royal and Sacerdotal Art was hidden so carefully, centuries since, in the High Degrees, as that it is even yet impossible to solve many of the enigmas which they contain.

Masonry is the veritable Sphynx, buried to the head in the sands heaped round it by the ages.] “The seeds of decay were sown in the Order of the Tem - ple at its origin. Hypocrisy is a mortal disease. It had conceived a great work which it was incapable of execut - ing, because it knew neither humility nor personal abnega - tion, because Rome was then invincible, and because the later Chiefs of the Order did not comprehend its mission. Moreover, the Templars were in general uneducated, and capable only of wielding the sword, with no qualifications for governing, and at need enchaining, that queen of the world called Opinion.” [The doctrines of the Chiefs would, if expounded to the masses, have seemed to them the bab - blings of folly. The symbols of the wise are the idols of the vulgar, or else as meaningless as the hieroglyphics of Egypt to the nomadic Arabs. There must always be a common - place interpretation for the mass of initiates, of the symbols that are eloquent to the Adepts.] “Hugues de Payens himself had not that keen and far - sighted intellect, nor that grandeur of purpose which after - ward distinguished the military founder of another sol - diery that became formidable to kings. The Templars were unintelligent, and therefore unsuccessful, Jesuits. “Their watchword was, to become wealthy, in order to buy the world. They became so, and in 1312 they pos - sessed in Europe alone more than nine thousand seignories. Riches were the shoal on which they were wrecked. They became insolent, and unwisely showed their contempt for the religious and social institutions which they aimed to overthrow. Their ambition was fatal to them. Their pro - jects were divined and prevented.” [Rome, more intolerant of heresy than of vice and crime, came to fear the Order, and fear is always cruel.

Never was a Coup d’Etat accomplished with a more formidable concert of action. The whole world was struck with stupor, and eagerly waited for the strange revelations of a process that was to echo through so many ages. “It was impossible to unfold to the people the conspiracy of the Templars against the Thrones and the Tiara. It was impossible to expose to them the doctrines of the Chiefs of the Order.” [This would have been to initiate the multi - tude into the secrets of the Masters, and to have uplifted the vail of Isis. Recourse was therefore had to the charge of magic, and denouncers and false witnesses were easily found. When the temporal and spiritual tyrannies unite to crush a victim they never want for serviceable instruments.] “The Templars were gravely accused of spitting upon Christ and denying God at their receptions, of gross obscenities, conversations with female devils, and the worship of a mon - strous idoL “The end of the drama is well known, and how Jacques de Molai and his fellows perished in the flames. But be - fore his execution, the Chief of the doomed Order organized and instituted what afterward came to be called the Oc - cult, Hermetic, or Scottish Masonry. In the gloom of his prison, the Grand Master created four Metropolitan Lodges, at Naples for the East, at Edinburg for the West, at Stockholm for the North, and at Paris for the South.” [The initials of his name, J..

The legend of Osiris was revived and adopted, to symbolize the destruction of the Order, and the resurrection of Khi~n3.m, slain in the body of the Tem - ple, of K~a~i KBAI, the Master, as the martyr of fidelity to obligation, of Truth and Conscience, prophesied the re - storation to life of the buried association.] “The Pope and the King soon after perished in a strange"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"KNIGHT KADoSH. 263 and sudden manner. Squin de Florian, the chief denouncer of the Order, died assassinated. In breaking the sword of the Templars, they made of it a poniard; and their pro - scribed trowels thenceforward built only tombs.” [The Order disappeared at once. Its estates and wealth were confiscated, and it seemed to have ceased to exist. Nevertheless it lived, under other names and governed by unknown Chiefs, revealing itself only to those who, in pass - ing through a series of degrees, had proven themselves worthy to be entrusted with the dangerous Secret. For the modern Orders that style themselves Templars have as - sumed a name to which they have not the shadow of a title.] “The successors of the Ancient Adepts Rose Croix, abandoning by degrees the austere and hierarchical Science of their ancestors in initiation, became a Mystic Sect, united with many of the Templars, the dogmas of the two inteD. mingling, and believed themselves to be the sole deposita - ries of the secrets of the Gospel o Saint John, seeing in its recitals an allegorical series of rites proper to complete the initiation. “The Initiates, in fact, thought in the eighteenth century that their time had arrived, some to found a new Hierarchy, others to overturn all authority, and to press down all the summits of the Social Order under the level of equality.” The mystical meanings of the Rose as a Symbol are to be looked for in the Kabalistic Commentaries on the Canticles. The Rose was for the Initiates the living and blooming symbol of the revelation of the harmonies of being. It was the emblem of beauty, life, love, and pleasure. Flamel, or the Book of the Jew Abraham, made it the hieroglyphical sign of the accomplishment of the great Work. Such is the key of the Roman de la Rose. The Conquest of the Rose was the problem propounded to Science by Initiation, while Religion was laboring to prepare and establish the universal triumph, exclusive and definitive, of the Cross.

Religion, considered solely as a physiological fact, is the revelation and satisfaction of a necessity of souls. Its existence is a scientific fact; to deny it would be to deny humanity itseli The Rose Croix Adepts respected the dominant, hierarch - ical, and revealed religion. Consequently they could no more be the enemies of the Papacy than of legitimate Monarchy; and if they conspired against the Popes and Kings, it was because they considered them personally as •apostates from duty, and supreme favorers of anarchy. What, in fact, is a despot, spiritual or temporal, but a crowned anarchist? One of the magnificent pantacles that express the esoteric and unutterable part of Science, is a Rose of Light, in the centre of which a human form extends its arms in the form of a cross. Commentaries and studies have been multiplied upon the Divine Comedy, the work of D~rE, and yet no one, so far as we know, has pointed out its .especial character. The work of the great Ghibellin is a declaration of war against the Papacy, by bold revelation of the Mysteries. The Epic of Dante is Johannite and Gnostic, an audacious application, like that of the Apocalypse, of the figures and numbers of the Kabalah to the Christian dogmas, and a secret negation of every thing absolute in those dogmas. His journey through the supernatural worlds is accomplished like the initiation into the Mysteries of Eleusis and Thebes. He escapes from that gulf of Hell, over the gate of which the sentence of de - spair was written, by reversing the positions of hi~ head and feet, that is to say, by accepting the direct c~ppoaite of the Catho - lic dogma; and then he reascends to the light, by using the Devil himself as a monstrous ladder. Faust ascends to Heaven by stepping on the head of the vanquished Me - phistopheles. Hell is impassable for those only who know not how to turn back from it.

His Heaven is"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"KNIGHT KADOSH. 265 composed of a series of Kabalistic circles, divided by a cross, like the Pantacle of EzekieL In the centre of this cross blooms a rose, and we see the symbol of the Adepts of the Rose Croix for the first time publicly expounded and almost categorically explained. For the fi.rst time, because Guillaume de Lorris, who died. in 1260, five years before the birth of Alighieri, had not completed his Roman de la Rose, which was continued. by Jehan de Meung, a half century afterward. One is aston - ished to discover that the Roman de la Rose and the Divina Commedia are two opposite forms of one and the same work, initiation into independence of spirit, a satire on all contemporary institutions, and the allegorical formula of the great secrets of the Society of the Roses-Croix. The important manifestations of Occultism coincide with the period of the fall of the Templars; since Jehan de Meung, surnamed Chopinel, contemporary of the old age of Dante, flourished during the best years of his life at the Court of Philip IV. The Roman de la Rose is the Epic of old France. It is a profound book, under the form of levity, a revelation as learned as that of Apuleius, of the Mysteries of Occultism. The Rose of Flamel, that of Jehan de Meung, and that of Dante, grew on the same stem. Swedenborg’s system was nothing else than the Ka - balah, minus the principle of the Hierarchy. It is the Temple, without the keystone and the foundation. Cagliostro was the agent of the Templars, and therefore wrote to the Freemasons of London that the time had come to begin the work of rebuilding the Temple of the Eternal. He had introduced into Masonry a new Rite called the Egyptian, and endeavored to resuscitate the mysterious worship of Isis. The three letters L.. P.~. D.. on his seal, were for him the initials of the words “Lilia pedibus de - strue,” tread under foot the Lilies [of France]; and a Ma - sonic medal of the sixteenth or seventeenth century has upon it a sword cutting off the stalk of a lily, and the words “talem dal~it uitio messem,” such harvest revenge will give.

The registers of the Order of the Temple attest that the Regent, the Duc d’Orleans, was Grand Master of that formidable secret Society, and that his successors were the Duc de Maine, the Prince of Bourbon-Conds, and the Duc de Coss& Brissac. The Templars compromitted the King; they saved him from the rage of the People, to exasperate that rage and bring on the catastrophe prepared for centuries; it was a scaffold that the vengeance of the Templars demande& The secret movers of the French Revolution had sworn to overturn the Throne and the Altar upon the Tomb of Jacques de Molai. When Louis XVI was executed, half the work was done; and thenceforward the Army of the Temple was to direct all its efforts against the Pope. Jacques de Molai and his companions were perhaps mar - tyrs, but their avengers dishonored their memory. Royalty was regenerated on the scaffold of Louis XVI., the Church triumphed in the captivity of Pius VI., carried a prisoner to Valence, and dying of fatigue and sorrow, but the suc - cessors of the ancient Knights of the Temple perished, overwhelmed in their fatal victory. * * * * * * O.~.

To be a good and true Knight Kadosh, you must revere and love the GOD of Infinite Beneficence, labor for the good of the human race, strive to acquire a knowledge of the wonders of nature, and the sublime truths of The osophic Science, and practice all the virtues. Many men are capable of becoming learned, where few can become good, generous, disinterested, and magnanimous. Many are profound scholars, where few know how to be men. There is an immense distance between science and virtue; and yet, for the well-being of the world, one never ought to be divorced from the other. Masonry alone can unite them indissolubly; for it is love and the aggregate of all perfections. This union it is one purpose of this Degree to effect Its object is, to make real in action the noblest sentiments; to restore to man all his powers and the whole dignity of man - hood, and to make true again the ancient description of man, that he was made like unto or in the image of the Deity.

Des Payens was learned in the esoteric doctrines and formulas of initiation of the Chris - tians of the Orient; and he was, say the Chronicles, clothed in 1118 with the Patriarchal power, in the legitimate order of succession of Saint John, who never went beyond the East, and whose doctrines seemed more pure to the Tem - plars than those of other Apostles, who, carrying the word of CHIusT to the remotest nations, conceded something to their manners and customs, and allowed other rites to be practiced than those of the East. * * * * * * The Pope no longer sets his foot on the necks of kings, nor by a bull from the Vatican places realms under inter - dict, and dethrones emperors. The first Napoleon carried the Roman Pontiff, a prisoner of state, to Paris, and so avenged the indignities which that priest’s predecessors had often shown to kings. Realm after realm, Rome has lost the brightest jewels of her tiara, since the preachings of Luther and Melancthon shook the foundations of her power as with an earthquake. Even Catholic countries no longer tolerate the indignities of the Inquisition, nor permit the once terrible Order of JEsus openly to exist and plot within their limits; and in Portugal, Spain, and Brazil, Free-masonry publicly avows its existence and purposes; its Dignitaries hold high civil office, and its halls are dedi - cated with public ceremonies. The Grand Orient of Italy sits at Rome. Truly, the world moves! The Hospitalers fell in 1798. That Order had long before lost its object, and with it its dignity and strength.

There was not a single Knight who had ever been engaged with the Barbary Cor - sairs.

On the 10th of June, 1798, Napoleon landed on the island of Malta, and captured it almost without opposition. The Grand Master accepted the promise of a Principality in Germany, or an annuity of 300,000 francs, and an indemnity of 600,000 francs in ready money; and to each French Knight an annuity of 700 francs was granted, or of 1,000 if they were sixty years of age.

Th the year 1118, HUGUES DES PAYERS, connected with the Counts of Champagne, GEonRoI DE SAINT-OMER, of the family of Saint-Omer in Flanders, a French gentleman named RossAL, GEoFPRoI BIsoL, PAYEN DE Mo~rDIDIEB, ARCHAMBAUD DE SAINT-AIGNAN, D’ANDRi~, of the family of Monthard, and ma - ternal uncle of Saint Bernard, and DE GONDEMARE (whom HUGUES I., Seventh Count of Champagne, joined in 1125), pitying the dangers to which pilgrims were exposed in their journey to and return from Jerusalem, formed themselves into a society at that city, to serve as an escort to the pilgrims, receiv- ing them at, and reconducting them as far as, the mountain defiles and most dangerous passes. At first they were a mere association of individuals, without rules, or assuming a religious habit, but merely acting as an escort for the pilgrims when required. They lived in a house near the Temple, at Jerusalem, from which circumstance they came to be known by the name of Templars, or Knights of the Temple. The King of Jerusalem having selected Hugues des Payens to go to Rome and solicit succor, and, if he could obtain it, a new Crusade, that Knight, after performing this duty, presented his companions to Pope Honorius II., and requested that they might be formed into an Order, religious and military, like the Hospitalers, or Knights of St. John, for the protection of pilgrims. The Pope referred them to the Council, then assembled at Troyes in Champagne, which granted their request, and appointed St. Bernard to draw up the rules of the Order and prescribe a dress. Among the 275"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"276 APPENDIX. rules, they were each allowed a Squire or serving brother at arms, and three riding-horses; but all gilding and superfluous ornaments were forbidden, and their dress was prescribed to be white, as a mark of their profession; to which Pope Eugenius III. added a red cross on the left breast. The institution of the Order and its rules, approved by the Council, were also approved by the Pope. Many gentlemen of the best houses of France, Germany, and Italy joined the Order, and went with des Payens to Palestine. The Bull of Pope Alexander III., establishing peace between “the rival Houses” of the Templars and Hospitalers, in 1182, styles the former “The Master and Brethren of the Order of t4e Temple.” The Grand Master styled himself, “I, humMe Master of the Order of the Temple;” and the officers were entitled, for ex - ample, “Grand Preceptor of the House of the Temple at Jerusa - lem.” In a monument of the year 1125, Hugues des Payens entitles himself “Master of the Temple.” In King Baldwin’s letter to Saint Bernard, in 1127, the Order is called “The Brethren of the Temple.” In 1179, the Masters of the two Orders thus entitled them - selves: “We, Odon de Saint-A mand, humble Master of the Sol - diery of the Temple;” and “We, Roger des Moulins, Master of the House of the Hospital.” In the Bull of Confirmation of the Pope, the title used is, “The Master and Brethren of the Soldiery of the Temple.” In Latin their title was Pauperes Co?nmilitones C’hristi et Tern - ph Solomonis. Their briefer and usual title was “Knight of the Order of the Temple.” In a little time the Order largely increased. Princes of sove - reign houses and Lords of the most illustrious families of Chris - tendom joined it, and brought to it immense wealth, so that it soon became so rich and powerful as even to overshadow the Knights of St. John. Raimond Berenger, Count of Barcelona and Provence, became a member, and, too old to go to Jerusa - lem, sent large sums of money to carry on the war against the Infidels, laid down his power as sovereign Prince, and died among the Templars. Ailfonso, first King of Navarre and Ar - ragon, made the Knights of St. John, the Templars, and the"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"APPENDIX. 277 Monks or Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, heirs of his kingdom in 1131. In 1152 they distinguished themselves by defending, with the Knights of St. John, the city of Jerusalem, and rout - ing the Infidels, in the absence of Baldwin III.; and in 1153 at the siege of Ascalon, which they entered by storm, and were all slain. The Grand Master was sometimes styled “Master General of the Order:” and the Provincial Masters, “Master of the Knights in “ The Grand Prior, Grand Preceptor, and Grand Master of the Temple, in England [Master of the Chivalry of the Temple in England] were one and the same person and officer. The “Prior ‘of England,” and the “Preceptor of England;” the “Prior of France” and the “Preceptor of France” were each two one person; and so called, as well as “Grand Prior,” etc. Under them were Sub-Priors also called Sub-Preceptors. Geoffrey, Son of Stephen, Master, Grand Prior, Grand Pre - ceptor of England, styled himself “Minister of the Soldiery of the Temple in England.” There were also Provincial Priors, also called Preceptors. These were called Prwceptores Templi, and their Districts, Pre~o - ceptoria; because the Commissions or Mandates of the Master of the Temple to the Prioral Houses were called prwcepts, from their commencement, Prwct?pimus tibi, etc. The Pr~cep tories were not Bodies, but Districts; and the resi - dence of a Prior-Preceptor was a Pr~ceptoral House, also called Pr~ceptory. In the Pr~ceptories, Chapters were held, general and particular, ordinary and extraordinary. The Seal of a Chapter held at the Pr~ceptory at Dynneslee, by Bro.~. William de la More, the Martyr, last Master of the Temple in England, has on it a man’s head, with a long beard, wearing a small cap’ round which are the words TESTIS SUM AGNI—” lam the Wit - ness of the Lamb.” The vulgar modern title “Sir Knight” was not known. In 1179 dissensions grew up between the Templars and the Hoe - pitalers, which were settled for the time by the intervention of the Pope, in 1182. In 1186 the Grand Master of the Templars, deposi - tary and guardian of the crown of Jerusalem, gave it by his in - fluence to Guy of Lusignan. In 1187 they and the Hospitalers surprised the camp of Saladin, and distinguished themselves by the long and bloody battle of Tiberias, where they long carried"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"278 APPENDIX. everything before them, until betrayed by the Count of Tripoli, who, by agreement with Saladin, fled the field, and left the Templars surrounded by the enemy, where they were all slain or taken prisoners. In 1191 they purchased the island of Cyprus from Richard of England for 300,000 livres, and garrisoned it; but afterward restored it again to King Richard. In 1243, the Knights of the two Orders fought a battle against the Corasmins—who had taken and pillaged Jerusalem—that lasted two days, in which they performed prodigies of valor, and were almost annihilated, twenty-six Hospitalers and thirty-three Templars only escaping, and the Grand Masters of both Orders being slain. In 1251, the quarrel between the two Orders again breaking out, they fought a battle, in which the Templars were so cut to pieces that hardly one survived to bear the news of the defeat; and so few Templars were left in Palestine, that they were compelled peremptorily to summon all their Knights in the West to repair thither. In 1270, the Templars mortgaged all their lands in France to Philip III., the Bold, son of St. Louis, King of France, as secu - rity for twenty-five thousand marks of silver, borrowed by Greg - ory X. to carry on the wars against the Infidels: aud in the General Council at Lyons that year, the Grand Masters of the two Orders sat above all the Ambassadors, the Peers of France, and the other great lords who were present. In 1291, when Acre, with a garrison of 12,000 men, mostly Hospitalers, Tern - plars, and Teutonic Knights, was besieged by the Sultan, at the head of 160,000 infantry and 60,000 cavalry, Pierre de Beaujen, Grand Master of the Templars, was chosen Commander-in-chief, and defended it bravely to the last, until he was slain with a poisoned arrow, the city carried by storm, and its defenders slain. In 1301, a feud occurring between Boniface III. and Philip the Fair, King of France, in consequence of that Pope’s claim to temporal power in France, it was reported that the Templars offered their services to that Pontiff in the war which he medi - tated against Philip, and that they had furnished considerable sums of money to begin the war. In 1303 Boniface died, and was succeeded, eleven days afterwards, by Benedict XI., who also died, after occupying the chair of St. Peter only eight months. The Conclave of Cardinals then assembled at Perouse, and"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"APPE:NDIX. 279 remained in session nearly a year, divided into two factions, and resolved never to agree to the election of any one of themselves. Cardinal Francis Ga~tan, nephew of Boniface, and who had in - herited his hatred of the Colonnas, the partisans of France, was at the head of one of these factions; and at that of the other, which was devoted to Philip, was Cardinal Dupr6, intimate friend of the two Cardinals Colonna; whom, as well as their whole house, Boniface, through his hatred to France, had cruelly persecuted. Cardinal Dupr6 at length proposed to Cardinal Gaetan, that as they must needs select some one not in the Conclave, one of the two factions should name at its pleasure, three Ultramontane Archbishops, and the other faction should, within forty days afterwards, choose one of the three to be Pope; and offered, as if from generosity and regard for the good of the Church, to permit the party headed by Cardinal Gat~tan to make the nomina - tions. The latter communicated the propositiou to his party, by whom it was assented to, and embodied in a solemn agreement, drawn up, and signed by all the Cardinals. Ga~tan then nominated three Ultramontane Archbishops, all of whom had been creatures of his uncle, and espoused his inter - est against the king. The first of them was the Archbishop of Bordeaux, named Bertrand de Got, a prelate of a great family in Aquitaine, but fond of pleasure, devoured by ambition, an intimate friend of Ga~tan, whose entire confidence he had, and a subject of the King of England, who was then Duke of Aquitaine. Besides, he was a personal enemy of Philip the Fair, and es - pecially of Charles of Valois, his brother, who, during the wars between France and England, had ravaged the chateaux and lands of his brother and other relatives. Cardinal Dupr6, knowing the character of this Archbishop, dispatched a courier to the ~ing of France, bearing a copy of the agreement, and a letter from himself, advising him to make terms with the Archbishop. The King wrote to the latter that he desired to meet him on important business at an abbey in the midst of a forest near St. Jean d’Angely on a certain day. They met in the church of the abbey, where, after hearing mass, and swearing the Archbishop with his hand upon the altar to in - violable secrecy, he showed him the agreement, and informed him that it was in his power to make him Pope. I"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"280 APPENDIX. The Archbishop threw himself at the King’s feet, and em - braced them, with assurances of the profoundest gratitude, pledging himself that if he became Pope, the King should share his authority, and offering to give him any assurances to that effect that he might require. The King told him that, when he reached the chair of St. Peter, he wished him to grant him six favors, all just, he said, and which would redound only to the good of the Church and the State; but of which be desired to be assured, before entering into any more particular engagements with him. The five first conditions he made known to him. The sixth, he said, he would not make known until after his coronation as Pope. The Arch - bishop swore upon the holy sacrament to grant these requests, and gave his brother and two nephews to the King as hostages for performance. Information of this was sent by the King to Cardinal Dupr~, and he, with the consent of his party, nomi - nated Bertrand de Goust, native of Guienne, Archbishop of Bor - deaux, to be Pope, who was immediately elected, to the great joy of the nephew of Boniface and his party. He was installed in the College of Cardinals, held at Lyons; and took the name of Clement V. After the installation, the King made known his sixth condition; which was the execution and abolition of the entire Order of Templars. Clement was greatly surprised; but the King averring that they had been guilty of the most fearful crimes, of which he had good proof, the Pope agreed to institute secret investigations, and requested the King to communicate to him his proofs, that he might com - ply with his promise. Having for his mistress the beautiful Countess of Perigard, daughter of the Count de Foix, and avari - cious even to the practice of the grossest simony, this base Pontiff was prepared to commit any crime which his interest prompted. In 1307 the Pope summoned to his Court at Poitiers do Mola~i, Grand Master of the Templars, of an illustrious house in the County of Burgwady, who repaired thither with most of his Knights, abandoning the island of Cyprus. The Knights had dispersed themselves through the different States of Christendom, in which they had a great number of wealthy Pr~ceptories. It was reported that the Grand Master had brought from the Le - vant immense treasures, which were deposited in the House of the Order at Paris. The Grand Master, with his principal"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"APPEKDIX. 281 Knights, repaired to the Court of the Pope and were graciously received, the Pope carefully concealing the secret motive which induced him to require their attendance; but he consulted him in regard to a new Crusade which he had in view, called upon him for information, and proposed to unite all the military Orders in one Order, under one Grand Master. Perhaps he hoped thus to enable them to escape the vengeance of the royal assassin: perhaps it was to deceive. History has preserved the response of de MolaY to the project of the Pope. He showed the impracticability of the proposed union, for several strong reasons, but proposed, if the Pope desired, to hold a Chapter of Priors, Bailiffs, and principal Commanders, in the presence of the King, where he could learn their views, and decide as he might think best. The response breathed the purest spirit of religious piety, and submission to the Pope, coupled with mili - tary frankness and fearlessness. After the Knights of St. John took Rhodes, popular opinion became unfriendly to the Templars, for abandoning the Holy Land and living in Europe in idleness; and odious rumors began to circulate in regard to the Order. Philip then put in execu - tion his long cherished plans for the destruction of the Order. Two wretches, one a citizen of Beziers, named Squin de Florian, and the other an apostate Templar, being confined together in prison, charged with monstrous crimes, and despairing of their lives, confessed their crimes to each other. The apostate then made known to the officers of the prison that he was in posses - sion of a secret of vast importance, which he would make known to the King alone. Some historians charge this act upon a Templar, the Prior of Montfau9on, and another of the same Order, called Noffodei, who had both been condemned by the Grand Master and a Council of the Order, for their impieties, and for leading infamous lives, to end their days in close confine - inent. Whoever was the informer, Philip had him sent to Paris, saw him, and promised him pardon and even rewards, if he would divulge the truth. Upon this the wretch, having already drawn up the heads of his accusation, charged the whole body of Tem - plars with theft, homicide, idolatry, and sodomy. He added, that when a Templar was received into the Order, he was obliged to renounce Christ, and spit upon the Cross in token of detestation: that the Knights, who had secretly become Mahometans, by an"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"282 APPENDIL infamous act of treason sold the Holy Land to the Infidels. In the collection of Pierre Dupuy may be seen all the abominations and all the obscenities with which the informer endeavored to blacken his Brothers, and which decency will not allow us to repeat. The King had communicated these accusations to the Pope, in an interview at Lyons; and urged him more pressingly on the subject the next year at Poitiers. On the 9th of July, 1307, the Pope wrote to the King that if the corruption charged upon the Order was so general, and it must be abolished, he willed that all their wealth should be employed in the recovery of the Holy Land, and would not suffer the least part of it to be diverted to other uses: whence it is to be presumed that he suspected that in the persecution about to begin against the Templars, their crime was rather their great wealth than their irregular morals. Philip, not brooking the delays of the Pope, by a secret order, executed on the 13th of October, caused to be arrested in one day the Grand Master and all the Templars that were found in Paris and the different parts of his Realm, and confiscated all their property; for which proceeding several reasons were assigned. Some said it was because the Templars had furnished money to Boniface, to enable him to make war upon the King; others added (and the formal accusation contained the charge) that they had even obtained part of that money from the King’s Treasury, by means of a Templar who was Treasurer. Others said that the Templars had stirred up a sedition in Paris, that grew out of the King’s having debased the coin. The people insisted that no better reason need be sought for than the avarice of the King and his Ministers, and their greediness to handle the vast property of the Order. Philip had the year before arrested all the Jews in one day, despoiled them of their property, and driven them and their families, half-naked, and with scanty means for their subsistence on the road, out of his kingdom. And he had lately taken the principal share of the plunder of Italy, when Anaquia was pillaged by a band of adventurers se - cretly in his service. When Edward II. of England heard of the arrest of the Templars, he wrote to the Pope and most of the Sovereigns of Europe, begging them to close their ears against the calumnies circulated against the Knights, “the purity of whose faith,” said he, “whose good morals, and whose zeal for the defense of"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"APPENDIX. 283 religion, all England reveres.” But the haughtiness and ambi - tion of the TempJars had made them many enemies, and preju - diced most of the Bishops, their judges, with whom, indeed, as well as with the Hospitalers, they had had difficulties, in regard to their independence and the privileges of the Order. By ap - pointment of the King, these Prelates, assisted by William of Paris, a Dominican and Inquisitor, and the Confessor of the King, held the first examination of the prisoners, which William de Nogaret conducted. The Pope was surprised at this proceeding, and regarded the matter as an invasion of his rights. He suspended the powers of William of Paris, and interdicted the Bishops from proceed - ing with the case; and wrote to the King, claiming the jurisdic - tion, and requiring him to deliver over to two Cardinals or to his Nuncio, the persons and property of the Templars. The King replied boldly and contemptuously; and the Pope yielded, and allowed the King’s Tribunal to proceed, the persons and prop - erty being, to save appearances, in form but not in reality, placed in the hands of the Pope’s Nuncio. The proceedings commenced. The prisons were full of Knights; all of whom that did not voluntarily confess were subjected to the most extreme torture in use. Nothing was heard but the cries and groans of those who were torn with hot pincers, their bones crushed, and their limbs torn asunder in the torture. Many, to escape the awful agony, confessed what - ever they were required; but many, in the midst of the most fearful torments, insisted with invincible firmness and constancy, that they were innocent. The Pope himself interrogated seventy-two who confessed. One Knight of the Order, an officer of the Pope, pretended to reveal all the wicked practices of his Brethren. The Pope then ordered the Grand Master, the Grand Priors, and the principal Commanders, of France, of beyond seas, and of Normandy, Aquitaine, and Poitou to be brought before him. It was pre - tended that the Grand Master had, at Poitiers, and also at Paris, confessed most of the crimes imputed to him and the Order; and had written a circular letter, urging all the Knights to do the same. The Apostolic Commissioners, on their return from Chinon, laid the pretended proces-verbal of his confession before the King and Pope. 1"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"284 APPENDIX. But when measures were about to be taken to extinguish the Order, based on the confessions of a great number of Templars, the Royal and Ecclesiastical miscreants were surprised to learn that the greater part of the Knights had revoked their confes - sions, and averred that they were extorted from them by torture; that they detested the pardon which the officers of the King had offered them, and regarded it as the price of infidelity, and the shameful reward of prevarication, as injurious to their honors as to their consciences. The Kings of England, Castile, and Arragon, the Count of Provence, most Christian Princes, and even the Archbishops of Italy, had, in the meantime, on the urging of the Pope, arrested all the Templars in their dominions. Garrisons were placed in their Pr~ceptories, their property was seized, and everywhere the proceedings against them went on. The Templars of Arra - gon at first took refuge in their fortresses, built by them to de - fend that country against the incursions of the Moors; and wrote to the Pope justifying themselves and asserting their innocence; urging that the charge against them that they were Infidels was particularly absurd, because many of their Brethren were cap - tives among the Moors, and treated most cruelly as Christians and they claimed the right to prove their innocence, as Knights were entitled to do, by wager of battle. The Pope is not known to have answered their letters; and James II. of Arragon besieged them, took them prisoners, and confined them, to be tried by the Bishop of Valencia. Most of the prisoners in France were collected in Paris. The revocation of the confessions embarrassed the Judges; but they finally determined that they should be treated as relapsed, and as having renounced Christ. De MolaY was agaiii brought before the Commissioners, and asked if he had anything to say in de - fense of his Order. He answered that he would cheerfully under - take, and would be delighted with the opportunity, to prove in the face of the Universe the innocence of his Order; but that he could neither read nor write (like most of the nobility). He de - manded to be allowed to employ an advocate; “though,” said he, “I have not four farthings left, to defray the costs of so great a suit.” The Commissioners told him that persons accused of heresy could be allowed neither counsel nor advocate; and advised him,"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"APPENDIX. 285 before undertaking the defense, seriously to reflect, reminding him of his pretended confessions; and thereupon they were read to him. Never was astonishment like that of the Grand Master. When he heard them read, he made the sign of the cross, and said that if the three Cardinals, before whom he appeared at Chinon, and who had signed the examination, were not what they were, he should well know what to say. Being urged to ex - plain himself more openly, he said (not being able to control his anger), that they deserved the same punishment which the Sara - cens and Tartars inflicted on forgers and liars, whose bellies, he said, they rip open, and cut off their heads. The authentic proceedings show, that before the assembly at Chinon, and upon the promise of immunity of the King and Pope, he had on two occasions confessed a part of the crimes charged against him. Apparently the clerk had added aggra - vating circamstances,—perhaps all the crimes imputed to the Order: and to conceal the cheat had not read the paper to him. iDe Mola! claimed to be sent before the Pope, who had reserved the right of trying him; and added that he had but three things to represent in favor of the Order: 1st. That except in the Cathedral Churches, nowhere in all Christendom was the di- vine service celebrated with more devotion, nor anywhere were to be found a greater number of relics and richer ornaments. 2d. That in every Pr~ceptory a general alms was given three times a week. 3d. That there was no Order, nor any Nation, where the Knights and gentlemen had more generously exposed their lives in defense of the Christian religion, than the Tem - plars had always done. The Commissioners told him that all that was useless without faith. He replied that the Templars firmly believed everything that the Catholic Church believed; and that it was for the maintenance of so holy a belief, that so great a number of those Knights had poured out their blood against the Saracens, the Turks, and the Moors. Brother Pierre de Boulogne, a Priest, and Procureur-General of the Order, pleaded for the Order. He represented the means by which confessions had been extracted: by promises of pardon in letters-patent, under the King’s seal, and those failing, by torture. He said that many Knights had died in their dungeons, and he invoked the jailers and executioners to prove that they"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"286 APPENDIX. had invariably died protesting their innocence. And he de - manded to be heard in full council, with his Superiors, and the Deputies of the whole Order, “to prove,” he said, “their inno - cence in the face of all Christendom.” But all was prejudged, and the Commissioners proceeded ac - cordingly. Those who had confessed were either discharged, or condemned merely to a canonical penance. Those who had re - yoked their confessions were treated with every species of rigor. Fifty-nine were degraded, as relapsed, by the Bishop of Paris, and given over to the secular arm. They were taken out of the gate St. Antoine and burned alive by a slow fire. In the midst of the flames, all invoked the Holy Name of God; and what was most surprising, not one of the fifty-nine would deliver himself from so awful an agony and death, by accepting the amnesty which relatives and friends were holding out to them, from the King, if they would renounce their protestations of inno - cence. And a great number of Templars, in other parts of France, in the midst of the flames, showed the same firmness. They burned them; but they could not extort from them any admission of the crimes charged against them. “It was an astonishing thing,” says the Bishop of Lod6vre, a contemporary historian, “that these unfortunates who were delivered over to the most cruel pun - ishments, gave no other reason for retracting their confessions, than their shame and remorse/or having, under the influence of torture, confessed to crimes of which they now declared themselves perfectly innocent.” The King, with his relatives and chief nobles, repaired to the Great Council held at Vienne in Dauphiny, the first session of which was held on the 16th of October, 1311, when there were present more than three hundred Bishops, besides the Abbots, Priors, and most celebrated Doctors of Christendom. The Pope had the proceedings against the Templars read, and the question as to suppressing the Order was then put to each of the fathers, in turn. An Italian Prelate advised it; but all the Bishops and Archbishops of the Council, and the most celebrated Doctors, unanimously represented to the Pope, that, before ex - tinguishing so illustrious an Order, and one which had from the time of its institution rendered so important services to Chris - tianity, they ought to hear the Grand Master and Principal of the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"APPENDIX. 287 Order in their defense, as justice required, and as they had them - selves demanded so urgently by many petitions. All the Bishops of Italy, save one, were of this opinion; and with them agreed those of Spain, Germany, Denmark, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and all the Prelates of France except three, the Archbishops of Rheims, Sens, and Rouen, so that only four Prelates out of more than three hundred were found to deny the right of defense, contrary to the first principles of natural equity. But the time had come for the knavish and unprincipled Pope to comply with his oath to the kingly assassin, torturer, and robber. lie delayed the matter by conferences, and at last declared that if the Templars could not be otherwise condemned without the formality of being heard in their defense, the plenitude of the Pontifical power would supply everything; and that he would condemn them by way of expedient, rather than that his dear son, the King of France, should be disappointed. And, in fact, on the 22d of May, 1312, after obtaining assur - ance of support, in a secret Consistory of Cardinals, and of some of the Bishops who had been won over, he held the second ses - sion of the Council, and therein quashed and annulled the mili - tary Order of the Templars. “And though we cannot,” he said in his sentence, “pronounce according to the forms of law, we condemn them provisionally and 1y the Apostolic authority, re - serving to ourselves and to the Holy Roman Uhurch the disposi - tion of the persons and property of the Templars.” The question then arose as to the disposition to be made of their property. The Pope proposed to give it to the Knights of Rhodes (the new name of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem). The partisans of France proposed to found a new Order, to be re - ceivers of the spoil. But the Pope, by large promises of reform - ing the order of St. John, prevailed. All the property of the Templars was given to the Knights of Rhodes, except so much as was in Spain, which by special provision was to be applied to the defense of that country against the Moors, who yet occupied Grenada. The next year, and after the adjournment of the Council, the next act of the tragedy was performed. The Pope, who had promised to try the Grand Master, and the Grand Preceptors or Grand Commanders, devolved that business on two Cardinals, who went to Paris and associated with themselves the Archbishop"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"288 APPENDIX. of Sens, and some other Prelates of the Gallican Church. These apostolical Commissioners caused to be brought before them, by the Prev6t of Paris, Jacques de Molai, the Grand Master, whose rank was equal to that of a Prince; Guy, brother of the Dauphin of Viennois, Sovereign Prince of Dauphiny; Hugues de Peralde, Grand Prior, or Visitor of the Priory of France; and the Grand Prior of Aquitaine, who had, before his arrest, had the direction of the finances of the King. It does not appear that the Prelates put any new questions to the prisoners, or that they were confronted with the witnesses; although the proceedings aped the ordinary judicial forms. The tribunal was content with the confession which they had already made before the Pope and the King; and upon that, and follow - ing the intentions of the Pope, the Judges agreed, if the prisoners stood to their first confession, to condemn them to perpetual imprisonment only. But as it was important to calm men’s minds, astonished at so many fires lighted in the different provinces of the Realm, and above all, to convince the people of Paris that so great a number of Templars had justly been burned alive, the four prisoners were required, if they would save their lives and have the benefit of the Pope’s promise to that effect, to make in public a sincere declaration of the abuses and crimes committed in their Order. For this purpose a staging was erected in the nave of the Cathe - dral Church, upon which the archers and soldiers led the accused. One of the Legates opened the ceremony by a harangue, in which he expounded at great length all the impieties and abominations whereof, he said, the Templars were convicted by their own ad - mission. And, to leave no doubt on this subject, he called on the Grand Master and his companions to make anew, before the people, the confession which they had made before the Pope, of their crimes and their errors. As if to induce them to make this declaration, they were on the one hand assured of a full pardon, while on the other, to intimidate them, the executioners prepared a pile of wood, as if they were to be burned on the spot, if they revoked their first confession. The Priors of France and Aquitaine adhered to their confes - sions, terrified by the immediate prospect of an awful death. But when it came the Grand Master’s turn to make his declara - tion, all were surprised, as, rattling the chains with which he was"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"APPENDIX. 289 loaded, he advanced with a bold countenance to the very edge of the staging, and raising his voice, that he might be the better heard, cried aloud “It is very right, that on this terrible day, and in the last moments of my life, I should uncover all the ini - quity of the lie, and cause the truth to triumph. L declare then, before heaven and earth, and I avow, although to my eternal shame, that I have committed the greatest of all crimes; but only by acknowledging the truth of those so foully charged against an Order, of which the truth to-day compels me to say that Order is innocent. I agreed to the declaration demanded of me, solely to procure a respite from the excessive agony of the tortures, and to endeavor to move those to compassion who left me to suffer. I know the punishment that has been imposed on those who have revoked similar confessions; but the fearful spectacle that fronts me cannot make me confirm a first lie by a second. Upon a condition so infamous, I heartily renounce a life already hate - ful to me. And what would it avail me to prolong a miserable life, which I must owe to the basest calumny and slander !“ He would have said more, but they forced him to be silent. The brother of the Prince Dauphin, who came after him, held the same language, and loudly protested the innocence of the Order. The prisoners were then remanded to prison; and the King, naturally vindictive, and more irritated by this public retraction of the Chiefs of the Order, caused them to be burned alive by a slow fire, on a little island in the Seine, between the King’s gar - den and the convent of the Augustins. The Grand Master, in the midst of his cruel punishment, showed the same courage as in the Cathedral, and made similar declarations. He protested anew the innocence of the Order; but confessed that he himself deserved death, for having confessed the contrary before the King and Pope. Some authors say that one of the Priors, deter - mined by the noble resolution of De Mol&i, had also revoked his confession, and was burned with the Grand Master, and the brother of the Prince Dauphin. The other died in prison. When the Grand Master could at length move his tongue only, and was nearly stifled with smoke, he in a loud voice summoned the Pope, that iniquitous judge and cruel butcher, to appear before the Tribunal of the Sovereign Judge in fifty days, and Philip within a year; and both afterwards died at the times specified in his summons. I ~ 19"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"290 APPENDIX. All the people shed tears at the tragical spectacle of this exe - cution. The Grand Master had before his execution offered up this prayer: “0 God, permit us to meditate on the pains that Jesus suffered that we might be redeemed; and enable us to im - itate the example of endurance’ which He gave us, when He sub - mitted without a murmur to the persecutions and torments which bigotry and injustice had prepared for Him. Forgive, 0 God, those false accusers who have caused the entire destruction of the Order whereof Thy Providence had made me the head: And if it please Thee to accept the prayer which we now offer, grant that the day may come when the world, now deceived, may better know those who have sought to live for Thee. We trust to Thy goodness and mercy to compensate us for the tortures and death which we are now to suffer; and that we may enjoy Thy divine presence in the mansions of happiness.” Convinced of his innocence, many holy persons and devotees gathered the ashes of these noble victims, and preserved them as precious relics. This tragedy was enacted on the 11th day of March, 1313. The Knights of Rhodes or Malta greedily accepted the donation of the estates and riches of the Templars. A council was held, and persons appointed to receive the property, by an act dated at Rhodes, on the 17th of October, 1312, signed by the Grand Master, Foulques de Villaret, “by the grace of God and of the Apostolic See, Humble Master of the Holy House and Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, and Guardian of the Sepulchre of Jesus Christ.” But it cost them much time and vast sums of money to get the property out of the hands of the greedy courtiers who had pos - session of it; and finally they were compelled to consent to pay the King and his successor a large sum, for which the latter re - tained two-thirds of the moneys of the Templars, the ornaments of their churches, the furniture of their houses, and the fruits and revenues of their lands, and, in a word, all their movables up to the day when the Hospitalers obtained possession. Of this plunder the Pope received his share. Charles II., King of Naples and Sicily, and Count of Pro - vence and Fortalquiers, pursued the same course. He burned a great number of them, who would not confess, and gave the lands of the Order to the Hospitalers, but divided their money and personal effects between himself and the Pope. The Kings"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"APPENDIX. 291 of Castile and Arragon seized on most of their property in their realms. In England, the Hospitalers obtained the whole; and in Germany shared the property with the Teutonic Knights. Except in Portugal and Scotland, the Order was destroyed every - where. In Portugal it was continued, under the name of “The Order of Christ ; ~and in Scotland the Order was protected, as you already know, by Bruce. Elsewhere, hated and persecuted by the Pope, and by the Sovereigns and Princes of Christendom, and by the Hospitalers, who had become mighty by means of their ill-gotten wealth, the remaining Templars knew that it was entirely useless to attempt to revive their great, illustrious, and unfortunate Order. It has been with great confidence asserted, and it may be true, that, hav - ing in Palestine become intimate with the Knights of St. Andrew and other gallant and noble Masonic Knights and Princes, and many of them having been made Masons in the Holy Land, they sought to unite themselves with our ancient Frater - nity, hoping, by thus gaining accessions to their Order among the military Masons, one day to be able to recover their estates, and again to become the defenders of the Holy Land and the shield of Cbristendom against the Infidel. The Ma - sonic Knights and Princes, who by this time were to be found in every part of Christendom, gladly agreed to this union, and most of them were initiated into the Order of Templars, who first discarded their white habit and red cross, and assumed a Masonic garb; and also adopted Masonic signs and words, and assumed the name of Knights and Princes Kadosh, to protect themselves against traitors; for whom to arrive at this exalted degree would be impossible, in consequence of the assurance whicb, during their progress towards it, they would be compelled to give of their fidelity, their courage, and their discretion. Hence the hostility which the Knights of St. John, or of Malta, have always shown against Freemasonry: for even so late as 1740 the Grand Master of that Order caused to be published and enforced in Malta the Bull of Pope Clement XII., worthy suc - cessor of Clement V., against the Masons, and forbade their meetings; and in 1741 encouraged the Inquisition to persecute them."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"NAMES FOR COUNCILS OF KADOSH.
