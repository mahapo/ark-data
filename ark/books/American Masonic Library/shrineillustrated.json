Cook, who founded this publishing busi - ness in 186~’, was unalterably opposed to secret orders. While many of our publications reflect his spirit, our books have been extensively adopted as text books in conferring the secret work of all standard orders, and the pub~shers, in continuing their sale, believe they are filling a much felt want. In further justification, we submit the following from the pen of a noted Masonic authority. This quotation will naturally apply to treatises upon other secret orders “The objection to treatises and disquisitions on Masonic subjeds, that there is danger through them of giving too much light to the world without, has not the slightest, support from experience. In England, in France, and in Germany, scarcely any restriction has been observed by Masonic writers, except as to what is emphatically esoteric; and yet we do not believe that the profane world is wiser in those countries than in our own in respect to the secrets of Freemasonry. In the face o ~ these publications, the world without has remained as ignorant of the aporrheta of our art, as if no work had ever been written on the subject, while the world within—the craft themselves—have been enlightened and instructed, and their views of Ma - sonry, (not as a social or charitable society, but as a philosophy, a science, a religion), have been elevated and enlarged. “The truth is that men who are not Masons never read authentic Masonic works. They have no interest"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"PREFACE. in the topics discussed, and could not understand them, from a want of the preparator5~ education which the Lodge alone can supply. Therefore, were a writer even to trench a little on what may be considered as being really the ‘arcana’ of Masonry, there is no danger of his thus making an improper revelation to improper persons.~~ Mackey, Encyc. of freemasOnry, 188~ ed., p. 617. CHAPTER I. THE MYSTIC SHRINE. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ORDEI~. The Ancient Arabic Order, Nobles of the N{ystic Shrine, was instituted at Mecca, Arabia, hi the year 5459, or the year of Our Lord 1608. The ritual was prepared and issued at Aleppo, Arabia, by Louis Maracci, the great Italian translator of Mohammed’s Alkoran. The order was revived and established at Cairo, Egypt, in 5598. (June 14, 183~’. Freemasons have been accustomed to date all of their acts and in - struments according to the Hebrew Calendar.) The primary purpose of the Ancient Arabic Order, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, was the forma - tion of an Arabian and Egyptian Inquisition, or Vigilance Committee. The order was composed of the brave and upiight men of the time, who performed their duties fearlessly. It is said to have been an or - ganization much like the Vigilantes of California, who at the time of the rush to the gold fields, before any legal government was yet organized there, assumed the duties of captors, judges, jurors, and executioners of criminals. Since the courts of justice are now able to cope with lawlessness, and vigilance committees are not con - sidered necessary in modern times, the Ancient Arabic Order, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, has adopted other interests. The Shrine pin, however, is still considered"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE MYSTIC SHRINE. a badge of true an& honorable manhood, devoted to high ideals., In various cities ‘of Europe, Temples of the Mystic ‘Shrine were instituted some years ago, and they are thriving charitable and social organiza - tions. In 187.1 one of the foreign representatives of the order brought the ritual to America and placed it in the hands of Dr. Walter M. Fleming, 33rd degree, Sovereign Grand Inspector~General, Ancient and Ac - cepted Scottish Rite, and Eminent Commander of Columbia ~ommanderyNo. 1, Knights Templar, New York. Dr. Fleming, with other 33rd degree Masons, (including William J. Florence, Edward Eddy, S. C. Campbell, Oswald Merle D’Aubigne, G. W. Miller, John A. Moore, William S. Patterson, John W. Sim - mons and Albert P. Moriarty) and nearly all the Knights Templar of Columbia Commandery No. 1 instituted Mecca Temple No. 1, of the Mystic Shrine in New York. Dr. Fleming was unanimously chosen as Grand Potentate (or presldlng officer). For several years this Temple remained inactive, owing to the death of some of the leaders, and the lack of interest of the others. [n 1875 W. J. Florence brought from Europe the Oriental Ritual of the order as it was worked in foreign countries. In 1876 he called together the remaining members of the original Mecca Temple No. 1. A committee under his leader - ship was appointed to draft a constitution and ritual for the order in America. The constitution was adopted June 6, t876. Since Mr. Florence, the chairman of the commit - tee, and Dr. Fleming, Grand Potentate, were at that time members of the old buirlesque association known as the Sons of Malta, a portion of the ritual of that order was used. Pa 9 rt of the work was adapted from A BRIEF 1-IISTORY OF THE ORDER. 7 the higher degrees of the Rite of Memphis and the Scottish Rite, and also the Royal Arch and Templar degrees, York Rite, and it was then decided that only Masons of the 32nd degree by the Scottish Rite, or Knights Templar by the York Rite should be eligible to admission to the order. The EvEystic Shrine in America is a charitable and social organization devoted to the welfare of Free - masonry. The Imperial Council is the governing body, with subordinate branches called Temples. There are now about one hundred and fifty Temples in the United States. One adverse vote or blackball will reject a can - didate for th~ term of thirteen weeks. The initiation fee was originally placed at ten 9 dollars as the minimum sum, and the dues were not less than two dollars ant. nually. These sums are smalkr than the amounts re - quired by the majority of Temples at the present time. The Mystic Shrine is called an Arabic Order, but it is only in a spirit of frolic that Shrin~rs assume the ~‘arbe and role of Arabs. They do not worship the Mohammedan Allah, and they do not accept the re - ligion of Islam. Shriners are all Masons, believing in deity, and theyare all liberty-loving Americans. Organized for fun, the Shrine is called a “play - ground for Masons”. Its principles are pleasure, hospitality and jollity, without intemperance, coarse - ness or rudeness. It is a mistake to call the Mystic Shrine the highest degree of Freemasonry. It is not a part of the Masonic Lodge, but it ‘is perhaps the best loved of all the non-Masonic bodies composed of Masons. The brder in the United States numbers thousands of members, all enthusiasts at the Shrine of fraternal affection and good-fellowship. I. 6"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8 THE MYSTIC SHRINE.

The candidate acends the ladder and is seated on the top, his legs hanging over the concave side. Then he is told to take hold of the end of a large rope, about two feet long: held up by a small string or thead. He is told under no circumstances to let go of the rope, which he Ilrmly grasps, when the box falls to pieces, and he is shot down the concave side of the box, thump - ing his head and bnttocks on a partition that is fixed to receive him. He is then conducted to the Grand Po - tentate, whom he is commanded to approach with hum - ble and great reverence, stooping very low on his knees, his head near the ground, his but - tocks elevated, where he receives the”Grand Salaam” that is a blow on his buttocks with two pieces of board between which are placed some torpedoes that explode with a loud re - ~,port when they come together. This is called the Grand Salaam or stroke of introduction. Re is then introduced to the Grand Potentate, near whom is a Galvanic Battery, so arranged (under the carpet) that when the candidate is introduccd ~to the Grand Poten - tate, he receives a severe electric shock. All those to whose lot it fell, in the casting of lots, are allowed to’ come into the room and be seated. After a social meeting with the members, each of which pass around the room and are personally intro - duced to the officers and members present as well as the Arabian soldiers, two of the best boxers are left with the candidate talking. when one says to the other, I will bet you a dollar that I can guess nearer to this brother’s age than you can. The other takes the bet."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"28. THE MYSTIC 5HBINE. The money is placed in the hands of another Noble. The bettor, after they have made some ridiculous guesses, asks the age of the pelson. When ~he tells his age, they get into a quarrel about it; each gives the other the lie. A challenge is then given and accepted. A ring is formed, two of the candidates are chosen a~ seconds, and as soon as the gloves are produced, (large boxing gloves) the Grand Potentate appears, stops the fight, fines each of the tigbters One Hundred Dollars, and declares that tl~e seconds (candidates) must fight it out for their respective clients. That is, supposing A arid B to be the professional boxers, A’s second must fight with B; and B’s second with A. A ring is formed and the novice candidates meeting of course with some skilled Noble, get some rather bard knocks, which the Nobles and other candidates enjoy. While the fighting is going on, some Noble makes complaint that he has been robbud, his pocket picked. He had previously put a package, or some valuable article in the pocket or clothes of one of the candi - dates. A general search follows; the stolen property is found on a candidate who has not been exercised much and he is at once charged wilh the theft, is pitched on to by two or three of the Nobles, roughly hustled out’ of the room for trial, stripped of his clothing except a pair of drawers; he is then blindfolded, and after being led around the room, is seated on a large sponge fill - ed with ice water, when the news comes that he has been forgiven on account of his good character, which has just been received by telegraph; he is led out and invested with his former clothes. While the foregoing is being enacted, candidates who have escaped the Prize Fight etc. are conducted into another room, where they either find several mem— cers disguised as women, or find them discussing an ex - J fl~ITIATIOM. 29. pected visit of “Lady Nobles of the Shrine” or they are squarely told that there is to be such a visit that even - ing and a committee may be appointed to receive them in a proper manner.

He is allowed to escape from the room amid a roar of laughter from the on-lookers. Meanwhile, and during these scenes, another Drama takes place, while the last is going on as follows: Some member goes out and calls the most timid candidate aside, or if there be but one, some delay takes place, and ~he is left alone with the member who should be his friend. The member then hastily en~ deavors to encourage him, ‘and tells ‘him confidentially that he will not be harmed; that it is all ceremony, etc. and although organized as a vigilance inquisition a• broad, in this country it will become entirely a social order. Then he gives him the password, signs, etc., hastily, in confidence and iii full.

Furthermore, another member, a slender, fragile, smooth.faced young man (preferable) is selected to be robed as a woman or Arab girl. In white or brown flowing robes, gathered tightly at ~he waist, bare arms and neck, female wig or striped silk handkerchief about the head, face painted pale (with zinc and bismuth), eyebrows blackened ‘and arched, under eyelids penciled with India ink to disguise as much as possible.

Immediately after the candidates leave the Temple room a large banquet ‘table is placed in the position of the Altar, provided with luncheon or banquet (as can best be done, in vari - ety, according to ability ‘of body); when all is properly set a frame is placed up on the table, viz.: Fonr square sticks, forming a post for each corner, about fourteen inches or more high, with bars from each corner, forming a square frame the size of the table. All this is above the banquet and the supports a black cloth or cover, elevated in the center, ostensibly forming a tomb. The cloth is ornamented with sphynx, urn, crescents, etc., and should reach to the floor on all sides and be fringed; this conceals all the table and banquet. The Layer, Altar ox Incense and all the furniture are placed about the Temple on each side. In the North a scaffold is erected of two upright and one hori - zontal joists,painted black and strong enough to sup - port the weight ofa man whei~ suspended; a hole is in the center of the horizontal bar and a pulley on the right corner for a rope to slide over; also a strong peg on the center of the right perpendicuQar bar or post on which to fasten the rope after elevating the man, with a~clasp on the end of the noose in the center to hook Into the ring at the back of the culprit’s neck. The gibbet should be high enough to enable the ex - ecutioners to raise the extremities about three feet from the floor and leave a space of two or three feet above the head (all these appointments need cost but a small sum; the whole equipment has been so arranged as not to be too expensive, unless extravangant properties are desired). A member with white robe, skull and skele - ton-faced mask stands front of scaffold to adjust noose at proper time. ‘Two strong members at the side of scaffold, robed in black, to elevate the culprit.

The rough or Artificial Desert, etc., is then pre~ pared as follows: The candidates are hoodwiuked and m stocking feet enter after three loud alarms (violent blows from the mallet).

During this intercourse drum, fife, gong. organ, rattle, bugle, etc., etc., or any hideous pandemo - nium instruments desired. Then persecute and test candidates as much as they will stand. Finally they are returned, one by one, to the Temple again amid the din, overpowered, laid in a hammock or canvas and folded in and swung from side to side or thrown up - ward, carried hastily about and finally placed in some outer apartment to await the other eandidates.

Cook, who founded this publishing business in 186’?. was unalterably opposed to secret orders. While many of our publications reflect his spirit, our books have been extensively adopted as text books in conferring the secret work of all standard orders, and the publishers, in continuing their sale, believe they are filling a much felt want In further justification, we submit the following from tbe pen of a’ noted Masonic authority. This quotation will natur - ally apply to treatises upon other secret orders:— “The objection to treatises and diaciuisitiona on Masonic subjects, that there is danger through them of giving too much light to the world without, has not the slightest support from experience. In England, in France, and in Germany, scarcely any restriction has been observed by Masonic writers, except as to what is emphatically esoteric; and yet we do not believe that the profane world is wiser in those countries than in our own in respect to the secrets of Freemasonry. In the f~ace of these publications, the world without baa remained as ignorant of the aporrheta of our art, as if no work had ever been written on the subject, while the world within—the Craft tbem~elves—have been enlightened and instructed, and theit ~views of Masonry (not as a social or charitable society, but as a philosophy, a science, a religion), have been elevated and enlarged. The truth is that men who are not Masons never read au - thentic Masonic works. They have no interest in the topica discussed, and could not und~rstand them, from a want of the preparatory education which the Lodge alone can supply. Therefore, were a writer even to trench a little on what may be considered as being really the ‘arcana’ of Masoni~y, there is no danger of his thus making an improper revelation to improper persons.”—Mackey, Ency. of Freemasonry, 1887 ed., j~. 617.
