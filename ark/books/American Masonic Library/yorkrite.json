Commonly Called The York Rite The AMERICAN RITE of Freemasonry is not a new rite recently developed nor is it something added to the Masonic system. It is the grouping of degrees according to the best American tradi - Lions, of some of the oldest and most beautiful of the whole Masonic system. It is a system of degrees which includes the Lodge,Chapter,Council and Commandery, often erroneously referred to as York Rite Masonry. It is only in North America that there is this regular arrangement of degrees which makes the name — American Rite of Free - masonry — particularly applicable. The names of the various degrees or orders, and other pertinent facts are: 1. The Lodge, often referred to as the “Blue Lodge”, consisting of three degrees of (a) Entered Apprentice, (b) Fellowcrafi, and (e) Master Mason 2. The Chapter, inenibers of which are referred to as Royal Arch Masons, consisting of four degrees of (a) Mark Master, (b) Past Master, (c) Most Excellent Master, (d) Royal Arch Mason. 3. The Council, members of which are referred to as Royal and Select Masters, consisting of three degrees of (a) Royal Master, (b) Select Master, (c) Super-Excellent Master. ~4 The Commandery, members of which ace termed Knights Teniplar, consisting of thret~ Oi’ders (instead of the usual tem~ degree) (a) Order of the Red Cross, (b) Order of Malta, (c) Order of the Temple.

It makes no war on church, religion, political party, class or racial group, dedicating itself wholly to its purpose of making better ilien and Masons. There is noth - ing more interesting, more tragic, nor more educa - tional than\\the perio~ls of history which furnish the background for the Chapter and Council degrees, and in the C~immandery is brought to light not only some of the old Jewish history, but the prin - cipl~s enunciated by the Great Teacher who gave to the world the New Dispensation of Love, Truth - and Toleration, who brought Light to those who walk in darkness and Life to those in the shadow of Death. UNI VERSALITY The largest Masonic group under one banner in the United States is the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of the United States of America, established 1797, with approximately half a million members. Royal Arch Masonry is uni - versal Masonry, its thousands of Chapters being found wherever civilization extends. England alone has 1,751 chapters, 467 of them being in the City of London, Our own General Grand Chapter has subordinate chapters in Cuba, the Isle of Pines, find Puerto Rico. In Africa are 166 chapters, located in such out-of-the-way places as the Gold Coast, Cape of Good Rope, Egypt, Transvaal, Orange Free State, North and South Rhodesia, Nigeria, Tanganyska, Natal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Kenya, East Africa, South Africa, British East Africa, Uganda, Isle of Mauritius, Cape Province, Morocco and Nyasaland. NUMBER OF DEGREES The American Rite does not consist of a large number of degrees, all of which are CONFERRED — never communjcated, because if a degree is worth anything at all it is certainly worth the ef - fort necessary to confer it properly. Masonic edu ration depends not upon the number of degrees but upon the clearness with which its lessons are transmitted. ANCIENT CRAFT MASONRY There was once a time when all of what is r known as Freemasonry was contained in one de - gree. This was followed by a natural development resulting in a system of degrees known as En. tered Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason. In the latter degree was a beautiful tradition ex - plaining much of the Masonic symbolism. But when two rival Grand Lodges in England united more than a century ago, a vital and essential part of the third degree was removed and placed in a degree known as the Royal Arch. The Mother Grand Lodge was confronted with a large series of degrees and rites which it regarded as superfluous, causing it to make the following edict: I “Ancient Craft Masonry consists of three degrees and no more, namely those of Entered Apprentice, the Fel - low Craft, and Master Mason, includ - ing the Holy Royal Arch.” The foregoing is the only authoritative defini - tion of Ancient Craft Masonry in all the world. Thus did the Mother Grand Lodge set out Royal Arch Masonry as something to be attained by those who are interested in Masonic advancement. (4) (5)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"/ A The degree of Master Mason, Sublime as it is and exemplifying the most perfect of all dramas, being inconiplete, leaves the mind in a state of con fusion and bewilderment. In Royal Arch Masonry are found the essentials of symbolisni and philos ophy necessary for a Master Mason to understand its meaning, and the completion of the degree of Master Mason. Ther~ are individuals, few in number, who maintain that all Freemasonry is bound up in the system of three degrees. These we most re - spectfully refer to the definition set forth in full above. We do not belittle the three craft degrees in making the statement that the third degree is in complete or that Ancient Craft Masonry includes the Royal Arch. As Master Masons we know of our own knowledge the correctness of the first state - ment and we know the other upon authority of the Mother Grand Lodge declaration. The three aft degrees are indispensable. They are to Free masonry what reading, writing and arithmetic are to the student — the basic for all further study and advancement. These degrees include all Free - masonry just as Mother Earth contains all the forests and the flowers that flourish iii their sea - sons; just as every word in the English language is found in the alplialuet of twenty-six lettei-s; just as time dictionary contaimm every word of every oration ever delivered in the English tongui-. EDUCATION Men iiiay have great learning or lie trained in the skillful arts to the highest degree, but no man is really and truly educated until he knou s One higher than himself. He who knows nothing higher than himself is exhausted by the ordinary pursuits of peace and iii the sti-ess and straism of life has nothing to lean upon. Froni the prayel- at the very beginning of the Entered Apprentice de~ gree to the communication of “that which was lost” in the Royal Arch, runs a thread of gold which leads to a knowledge of that ONE. In the Chapter the profound truths of the Symnbolisimi of the Blue Lodge are unfolded and made clear. Then the thou ghtfiil Mason fully understands what it is all about. TIlE CHAPTER DEGREES MARK MASTER: The individual at work in the quarries, striving to put to use the working tools of the symbolic degrees in shaping the Per - fect Ashier of his life. Here he learns the duty he owes to hiniself and to his fellow creature — the basic virtues of Integrity, Morality and Charity. PAST MASTER: The application here is to society. As a Past Master he must learn to govern as he has learned in the preceding degrees to obey. No longer a lone workman laboring at his task, he now becomes an integral part of the social order. Re learns the meaning of that part of the Fellow Craft lecture- “from a point to a line, from a line to a superf ices, and from a superfices to a solid” Re himself is the point; as a Mark Master he be - comes the line, the base of all geometric struc - tomes; as a Past Master he puts the line in action and generates the superjices which forms tIme matheniatical .~quare. MOST EXCELLENT MASTER: The most ipectacular degree in all Freemasonry, applies to that spiritual elevation necessary to raise to an upright, living Perpendicular.” It supplies that third dimension — height — without which life (6) (7)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"r lacks synimimeti y and proportiou, and forms the solid. It beautifully exesimplifies the elevation of mind above matter and the elevation of soul above mind. The Temple is finished! Dedicated and consecrated to the service of the Most High God THE HOLY ROYAL ARCH: The climax of Ancient Craft Masonry and Masonic symbolisimi. The earthly cube and tIme Temimple erected upon it, full of eimrthly imperfections, gives way and upon its ruins is raised that spiritual Temple, not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. Its dimnensions of length, breadth and height are perfect. It is the sum total of life not finished here. And here we receive that “Word” which as a Master Mason you were told was feared “lost, forever lost.” THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMANDERY The ritual of the degrees of the Council and the Orders of the Temnple are profoundly interest - ing and are in further explanation of many ques - tions which arise in the preceding degrees. The de - gree of Super Excellent Master is perhaps the most dramatic of all the degrees of Freemasonry. The Orders of the Temple interpret the symbolism of Freemasonry according to the Christian faith. “Ask end ye shall receive, seek mind ye shell find, Knock amid it shall be open mrmitO you.” L_ (8) WITH deep appreciation to Ray V.
