Pnzuxascz DALCHO, M.D., to prepare such a work, In consequence c~ this request, Dx. DAICHo compiled a work, which, having been carefully examined by a committee appointed for that purpose, was highly approved, adopted by the Grand Lodge as its Book of ConstItutions, and ordered to be published under Its sanction. The work was accordingly published In that year, under the title of “An Ahiman Rezon, for the use of the Grand Lodge of South Carolina, Ancient York Masons, and Ihe Lodges under the Register and Masonic JurIsdiction thereof.” In 1817, the Grand Lodge of Ancient York Masons, as well as the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, were dissolved, and a union of the hitherto divided fraternity was consummated by the establIshment ol the present Grand Lodge of Ancient Free Masons. The AmMAN RazoN of Dx. DALcNo, consequently, lost Its authoritatIve charecter by the dissolution of thr body under whose sanction and for whose use it had been compiled. The new Grand Lodge. however, was as sensi - ble as its predecessor of the great Importance of such a work, and therefore, In 1822, it ordered a republication of it, which was done In the course of that year by Dx. DAY CEO, with many alterations and additions. This book has, since that period, been used as the Book of Constitutions In the jurisdiction of South Caro - lina, and referred to as established authority in all casea of Masonic jurisprudence.

But for some years past the work has been, as It Is technically called, out of print The greatest difficulty, In many Instances amounting to absolute Impossibility, has been experIenced by new L~odges lit obtaInIng copies; atid this circunistani’., together wIth the great revival of Masonry In tids jul’ladlctlou, seemed Imperatively to Call I~r the l)iIttII(UttIOa of another edition of the Book of Vomlstltutlons, Li 1881, the Grand Lodge, therefore, appointed a com - mittee, consisting of Bros. A. E. MILLER, Grand Master; W. L CLEvELAYD, Senior Grand Warden; ALraun Paxcu, Junior Grand Warden; J. H. Hosroux, Grand Treasurer; A. G. MACKEY, Grand Secretary, and T. S. Gouxuix, .daaletant Grand Secretary, to revise and republish the Ahirnan Rezon, for the use of the Lodges throughout the State. The committee having met and determined upon the character of the work which was Intended to be pre - sented to the craft, appointed Bro. ALBERT G. MACKEY, MD~ to superIntend the compilation and preparation for the press; and the work having been completed and presented to the committee for Its examination, was approved and recommended to the Grand Lodge, which body, at its quarterly meeting on the 2d of December, 1851, accepted it as its Book of Constitutions and gave it the sanction which has been inserted on a preceding page. It was found necessary, while taking the previous Ahiman Bezon, edited by Da. DALCHO, as the basis of the following compilation, to make an entire alteration in the arrangement, and insert a large amount of new mat - ter. To make room for these additions, without increas - ing the size of the book, it was deemed expedient to omit much that was contained in the former publication, and which was, Indeed, wholly Irrelevant to the objects of a Book of Constitutions PREFACE. 9 Among the additions to which reference has been made are a complete system of Monitorial instruction, intended to minimize the necessity of employing any other book in the ceremonies of initiating, passing, and raising; formulas for the annual installation of the officers of a Lodge and of a Grand Lodge, which are to be found in none of the Monitors; and in general, greater precision, and more defi - nite directions in the ritual of all the ceremonies of the Order. The chapter giving an historical sketch of the progress of Masonry in this State, from the union of the two Grand Lodges, in 1817, to the present day, (1852) which is entirely new, will, it is hoped, prove not altogeth - er useless or uninteresting. Notwithstanding the alterations and additions thus made have given to the present edition a character greatly different from that of the compilation superin - tended by Dii. DALCHO, so that the committee have felt themselves authorized in offering at to the Masonic public as an entirely new work, not the slightest innovation has been made in the essential portions of the book. The us - ages and customs, the rites and ceremonies of the Order, as practiced heretofore in South Carolina, have been pre - served with the most scrupulous veneration for their an - tiquity. In the republication of those principles of Masonic law which the Grand Lodge determined, m 1822, as the governing principles of the institution in this State, the present editor has not felt himself permitted to make even a verbal alteration, except in a very few instances, where a slight modification was found absolutely necessary to correct a careless or vitiated phraseology, without at all affecting the meaning of the sentence. Although this work has been prepared expressly for the use of the craft in the State of South Carolina, it is believed that it might be advantageously used by"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"V I w. stichtingargu~. ni w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w~ stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n 1 w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I I I 10 PBEFAcE.

Decorum and dignity of the meetIng alike suggest, even in popular assemblies called only for a temporary purpose, that a presiding officer shall with some formality be inducted Into the chair, and he then, to use the ordinary phrase, “opens” the meeting with the appointment of his necessary assist - ance, and with the announcement, in an address to the audience, explanatory of the objects that have called them together. If secular associations have found It expedient by the adoption of some preparatory forms to avoid the appear - ance of an unseeming abruptness in proceeding to busi - ness, it may well be supposed that relIgious societies have been still more observant of the custom, and that as their pursuits are more elevated, that the ceremonies of their preparation for the object of their meeting should be atill more ImpressIve.

In the Ancient Mysteries (those sacred rites which have furnished so many models for Masonic symbolism), the opening ceremonies were of the most solemn charac - tier. The sacred herald, In the Ancient Mysteries, com - menced the ceremonies of opening the greater initiations by the solemn formula of “Depart hence, ye profane I” to wbich was added a proclamation which forbade the use of any language which might be deemed of unfavor - able augury to the approaching rites. In like manner a Lodge of Masons Is opened with the employment of certain ceremonies In which, that atten - tion may be given to their symbolic as well as practical import, every member present is expected to take a part. These ceremonies, which slightly differ in each of the degrees—but differ so slightly as not to affect their gen - eral character—may be considered In reference to the several purposes which they are designated to affect, to be divided into eight successive steps or parts. 1. The Master having signified bis intention to pro - ceed to the labors of the Lodge, every brother is expected to assume his necessary Masonic clotbing, and, if an officer, the insignia of his office, and silently and decorously to repair to his appropriate station. 2. The next step in the ceremony Is, with the usual precautions, to ascertain the right of each one to be present. It Is scarcely necessary to say that In the performance of this duty, the officers who are charged with it should allow no one to remain who Is not either well known to themselves or properly vouched for by some discreet and experienced brother. 8. Attention Is next directed to the external avenues of the Lodge, and the officers within and without, who are intrusled with the performance of this important duty, are expected to execute it with care and fidelity. OPENING AND CI.oslNo OF rEE LODGE. 58 4. By a wise provision, It Is no sooner Intimated to the Master that he may safely proceed, than he directs his attention to an Inquiry Into the knowledge possessed by his officers of the duties that they will be respectively called upon to perform. 6. Satisfied upon this point, the Master then announces, by formal proclamation, his Intention to proceed to business; and mindful of the peaceful character of our Institution, he strictly forbids all Immoral or unmasonic conduct whereby the harmony of the Lodge may be Impeded. under no less a penalty than the By-Laws may Impose or a majority of the brethren may see fit to Inflict. Nor after this is any brother permitted to leave the Lodge during Lodge hours (that Is, from the time of opening to that of closing) without having obtained the Worshipful Master’s permission. 6. Certain mystic rites, which can here be only alluded to, are then employed, by which each brother present signifies his concurrence in the ceremonies which have been cele - brated, and his knowledge of the degree on which the Lodge is about to be opened. 7. It is a lesson which every Mason Is taught at once of the earliest points of his initiation, that he should com - mence no important undertaking without first Invoking the blessing of Deity. Hence the next step in the prog - ress of the opening ceremonies is to address a prayer to the Supreme Architect of tbe Universe. This prayer, althougb offered by the Master, Is to be participated In by every brother, and at Its conclusion the audible response of ‘So mote It be. Amen.” should be made by all present. 8. The Lodge is then declared, In the name of God and the Holy Salxts John, to be opened in due form, on the first, second or third degree of Masonry, as the case may be."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargux, lii w.stichtingargus. fl I w.stichtingargus.ri I w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. sticlitingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargLls. ol w. stichtinga rguN. ol w.stichti nga ~ ot ~v.sticht i fl~L~l’~~tP4 iii ~v.suchti l1{~til’f~It~ iii xvsucht I fl~tll ~ itl xv.sticl it i ll~l1i)+~ilrJ hI I 54 MANUAL OF THE LODGE. A Lodge Is said to be opened sn the nasno of God and the Holy Saints John, as a declaration of the sacred and religious purposes of our meeting, of our profound reverence for that Divine Being wbose name and attri - butes should be the constant themes of our contempla - tion, and of our respect for those ancient patrons whom the traditions of Masonry have so intimately connected with the history of the Institution. It is said to be opened in due form, to intimate that all that is necessary. appropriate, and usual in the cere - monies, all that the law requires or ancient usage ren~ ders indispensable, have been observed. And it is said to be opened on and not in, a certain degree, (which latter expression Is often Incorrectly used), in reference rather to the speculative than to the legal character of the meeting, to indicate, not that the members are to be circumscribed in the limits of a par - ticular degree, but that they are met together to unite in contemplation on the symbolic teachings and divine lessons, to inculcate which is the particular object of that degree. The ceremony of closing varies but very slightly from that of opening. Of course the first and second steps which have already been enumerated as proper to be observed when the brethren first assemble together, are to be dispensed with when they are about to part, as being under those circumstances entirely unnecessary, and the proclamations and prayers whicb refer to open - ing must be varied when they are to be appikd to the closing. But in all other respects the cerencinics are the same. Nors.—The usage in many jurisdictions permfts a Lodge to be closed “fn short form” on one degree. for the purpose of being opened in like manner on another degree. This is, how - ever, only to be done when the oblect Is to inttiate. pass or raise a esndidate. or w!ien the initiatlon in an Inferior degree OPENING AND CLOSING OF THE LODGE. 55 having been accomplished, It is necessary to resume labor on the third degree for the transection of business. Thus the Lodge being open on the third degree, and It being proposed “to pass” a candidate who Is in waiting, the Lodge of Mas - ters may he closed “in short form,” and a lodge opened in like manner on the second degree. The “short form” consists in the omission of all the usual ceremony, except the procla - mation hy the Master and Wardens. Dut a Lodge can never be opened at the beginning of a com - munication, nor finally closed at its termination, except “In due form.”"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"w.stichtingarguN. ft w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.ri I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n! w.stichtingargus.n I w. sticlitingargus. uil w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichti ngargus. id w.stichtingargLlH.nI w.stichtingargu~.lA w.stichtingrn’~uu.uI v.stichtlll~ul’~tvJ iii vv.st ichtl ll~3llLf~ll~J iii w.sticht I l1~3i1I ~Al1~ iii xv.siiclti I itpnl ~ iii iii xvsl ichi I It~I1i ~illf] id I 56 MANUAL OF THE LODGE. FORMS OF PRAYER PRAYER AT OPENING Most holy and glorious Lord God, the great Architect of the Universe, the giver of all good gifts and graces: Thou hast promised that, “where two or three are gath - ered together in thy name, thou wilt be in the midst of them, and bless them.” In thy name we assemble, most humbly beseechIng thee to bless us in all our undertak - ings, that we may know and serve thee aright, and that all our actIons may tend to thy glory, and to our advance - ment In knowledge and virtue. And we beseech thee, O LOrd God, to bless our present assembling, and to illuminate our minds, that we may walk in the light of thy countenance; and when the trIals of our probation - ary state are over, be admitted into THE TEMPLE “not made with hands, eternal In the heavens.” Response by the Brethren.—So mote It be. Amen. PRAYER AT CLOSING Supreme Architect of the Universe, accept our hum - ble praise for the many mercies and blessings which thy bounty has conferred on us, and especially for thIs friendly and social intercourse.

Make us sensible of the renewed obliga - tions we are under to love thee supremely, and to be friendly to each other.

Brethren: We are now about to quit this sacred retreat of friendship and virtue, to mix again with the world. Amidst Its concerns and employments, forget not the duties which you have heard so frequently Inculcated, and so forcibly recommended In this Lodge. Be diligent, prudent, temperate, discreet. Remember that, around this altar, you have promised to hefriend ad relieve every brother who shall need your assistance. You have promised, In the most friendly manner, to remind him of his errors, and aid a reformation. These generous prInciples are to extend further.

ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGReE. 59 ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE SYMBOLISM OF’ THE DEGREE. The first degree, or that of the Entered Apprentice, is Intended in its symbolic signification to furnish a repre - sentation of youth just entering on the struggles, the trials, and duties of an earthly and responsible existence. On his first admission into the Lodge, the candidate is reminded of the weak and helpless state of man on his entrance into the world—unprepared for the exigencies of the present, ignorant of the vicissitudes of the future, and dependent for his safety and very existence on that God in whom alone, in all trials mid difficulties, Is there any sure and abiding trust. And as the youth is prepared by a useful and virtuous education for his journey through life, so the Apprentice obtains in his first degree those first instructions whereon to erect his future moral and Masonic edifice. He now receives the elementary details of that universal language in which hereafter he is to converse with his brethren of all nations, so as to understand and be understood by Masons of every tongue and dialect under the sun. He is directed to take, as a staff and script for his journey, a knowledge of all the virtues that expand the heart and dignify the soul. Secrecy, obe - dience, humility, trust in God, purity of conscience, economy of time, are all inculcated by symbolic ceremonies too im - pressive in their character ever to be forgotten. And, lastly, as charity forms the chief corner stone of all the Masonic virtues, the beauty and holiness of this attribute are depicted in emblematic modes which no spoken language could equal The degree of the Apprentice is, in short, one of probation and preparation for a more advanced position, and more exalted privileges and duties."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"xv. stichtingarguN. l~ I xv.stichtingargus.n I xv. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nI xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n! w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichti flgargLlH.lI) ~v.stichI I ll~lllI KIlN ill I 60 MANUAL OF THE LODGE. FIRST LECTURE. The first lecture of Free Masonry. or that appropriated to the degree of an Entered Apprentice, is divided Into three sections. In this lecture virtue is painted in the most beautiful colors, and the duties of morality are strictiy enforced. In it we are taught such useful les - sons as prepare the mind for a regular advancement In the principles of knowledge and philosophy; and these are imprinted on the memory by lively and sensible Images, to influence our conduct In the proper discharge of the duties of social life. Every candidate, before his reception, Is required to make the following declarations to the Senior Deacon, In the presence of the Stewards, in a room adjacent to the Lodge. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that, unbiased by the Improper solicitation of friends, and uninfluenced by mercenary motives, you freely and vol - untarily offer yourself a candidate for the ulysterfes of Masonry? I do. Do you sincerely declare, upon your honor, that you are prompted to solicit the privileges of Masonry by a favorable opinion conceived of the Institution, and a desire of knowledge? I do. Do you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you will cheerfully conform to all the ancient usages and established customs of the fraternity? I do. FIRST SECTION. The first section of the Entered Apprentice’s Lecture principally consists of a recapitulation of the ceremonies of Initiation. But, on this account, a knowledge of It Is highly necessary to every Mason, that he may be the bet- ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE. ter enabled to assist In the correct performance of the ritual of the degree. It is, however, introduced by some general heads, which qualify us to examine the rights of others to our privileges, while they prove our claims to the character we profess. It is, of course, ImpossIble, in a monitorlal work, to give a full explanation of the various symbols and cere - monies which are used in the Inculcation of moral and religious truths; but an allusion, in even general terms, to the most important ones, in the order in which they occur, will be sufficient to lead the contemplative Mason to a further examination of their Import. THE SHOCK OP ENTRANCE. In the symbolic science of Masonry, the LOdge is often represented as a Symbol of life. In this case, Lodge labor becomes the symbol of the labor of life, its duties, trials, and temptations, and tbe Mason is the lype of the laborer and actor in that life. The Lodge is, then, at the time of the reception of an Entered Apprentice, a symbol of the world, and the initiation Is a type of the new life upon which the candidate is about to enter. There he stands without our portals, on the threshold of this new Masonic life, in darkness, helplessness, and ignorance. Having been wandering nn,id the errors and covered over with the pollutions of the outer and pro - fane world, he comes inquiringly to our doors, seeking the new birth, and asking a withdrawal of the veil which conceals divine truth from his uninitiated sight. Here, as with Moses at the burning bush, the solemn admoni - hon is given, “Put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the ilace whereon thou standest is holy ground ;“ and cere - rijonial preparations surround him, all of a significant character, to indicate to him that some great change is thout to take place in his moral and intellectual condi - lion. He is already beginning to discover that the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"xv. stichtingargut~ .111 xv. stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingargus.nI xv.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichti ngargus. ol w.stichtingarguN. ol w.stichtingllrguh.n! ~v.sticht i 0t~Llf~tlN iii v.StiChtifl~Lll~Ur~ ill ~V.StiChtiltlPf~ll~ lii 62 MANUAL OF THE LODGE. design of Masonry is to introduce him to new views of life and its duties. He Is, indeed, to commence with new lessons in a new school. There is to he, not simply a change for the future, but also an extinction of the past; for initiation is, as it were, a death to the world and a resurrection to a new life. And hence it was that among the old Greeks the same word signified both to die and to be initiated. But death, to him who believes in iminor - tality. is but a new birth. Now, this new birth should be accompanied with some ceremony to indicate symboli - cally, and to impress upon the mind, this disruption of old ties and formation of new ones. Hence the impres - sion of this idea is made by the symbolism of the shock at the entrance. The world is left behind—the chains of error and ignorance which had previously restrained the candidate in moral and intellectual captivity are to be broken—the portal of the Temple has been thrown widely open, and Masonry stands before the neophyte in all the glory of Its form and beauty, to be fully revealed to him, however, only when the new birth has been completely accomplished. Shall this momentous occasion be passed unnoticed? Shall this great event— the first in the Masonic life of the aspirant—have no visible or audible record? Shall the entrance, for the first time, into the Lodge—the birth, as it has justly been called, into Masonry—be symbolized by no outward sign? Shall the symbolism of our science, even ready at all other times, with its beautiful teachings, here only be dumh and senseless? Or, rather, sh~ill not all the Sons of Light who witness the impressive scene feel like the children of Korah, who, when released from the captivity of Babylon, and once more returning to the Temple, exclaimed, in the heart-burst of their grateful joy, “0, clap your hands all ye people; shout unto God with I he voice of triumph.” ‘I ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE. The SHOCK 07 ENTRANCE is, then, the symbol of the disruption of the candidate from the ties of the world, and his introduction into the life of Masonry. It is the symbol of the G9oniea of the first death and of the throes of the nrw birth. PRAYER AT THE INITIATION OF A CANDIDATE. As Masons, we are taught never to commence any great or important undertaking, without first invoking the blessing of Deity. At the initiation of a candidate it is, therefore, usual to nake use of the following: PRAYER, Vouchsafe thine aid, almighty Father of the Universe, to this our present convention, and grant that this can - didate for Masonry may dedicate and devote his life to thy service, and become a true and faithful brother among us. Endue him with a competency of thy divine wisdom, that by the secrets of our art he may be better enabled to display the beauties ol godliness to the honor of thy holy name. So mote It be. Amen. THE Rrru ow CIUCUMAXUULATION. The rite of circumambulation, derived from the Latin verb “circumambulare,” to u,a2k around anythin9, is the name given to that observance in all the religious cere - monies of antiquity, which consisted In a procession around the altar or some other sacred object."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"xv. stichtingarguN,i I xv.stichtingargus.ii I xv. stichtingargus.n I xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n! w.stichtingargus.n I w. sticlitingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. ii) w. stichti fl~El rgLlH w. stichti flail rguh. lit xv.stichti iai~viu,nf ~v. sti chi i fl8Llt’P1 ~tj,, iii xvsticht I fl~tll’f~urhiiI vv.~ticht I llfi~[ll’~~~F.J iii xv.sticht i l1~tllj—~itri iii xx’.sticIitiit~iii~iiu iii xx’.slicltl ilipihl ~AilI~ iii I 114 MANUAL OF THE LODGE. Thus, in Greece, the priests and the people, when engaged in their sacrificial rites, always walked three times around the altar while singing a sacred hymn. MAcaomus tells us that this ceremony had a reference to the motion of the heavenly bodies, which, according to the ancient poets and philosophers, produced a harmo - nious sound, inaudible to mortal ears, which was called “the music of the spheres.” Hence, in making this pro - cession around the altar, great care was taken to move In imitation of the apparent course of the sun. For this purpose, they commenced at the east, and proceed - ing by way of the south to the west, and thence by the north, they arrived at the east again. By this method, it will be perceived that the right side was always near - est to the altar. Much stress was laid by the ancient on the necessity of keeping the altar on the right hand of the persons moving around, because it was in this way only that the apparent motion of the sun from easi to west could be imitated. Thus PLAUTU5, the Roman poet, makes one of his characters say, “If you would do reverence to the gods, you must turn to the right hand ;“ and GEoNovius, in commenting on this passage, says that the ancients, ‘in worshiping and praying to the gods, were accus - tomed to turn to the right hand.” In one of the hymns of CALLIMACIIU5, supposed to have been chanted by the priesta of APOLLO, it is said, “We imitate the example of the san, and follow his benevolent course.” VIRGIL describes CORYNAEUS as purifying his companions at the funeral of MIsENus by passing three times around them, and at the same time aspersing them with the lustral water, which action he could not have conveniently per - formed, unless he had moved with his right hand toward them, thus making his circuit from east to west by the south. ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE 65 In fact, the ceremony of circumambulation was, among the Romans, so intimately connected with every religious rite of expiation or purification, that the same word, “lustrare,” came at length to signify both to purify, which was its original meaning, and also to walk around any - thing Among the Hindoos, the rite of circumambulation was always practiced as a religious ceremony, and a Brahmin, on rising from his bed in the morning, having first adored the sun, while directing his face to the east, then proceeds by the way of the south to the west, exclaiming at the same time, “I follow the course of the sun.” The Druids preserved this rite of circumambulation in their mystical dance around the cairn or altar of sacred stones. On these occasions, the priest always made three circuits, from east to west, around the altar, having it on his right hand, and accompanied by all the worshippers And this sacred journey was called, in the Celtic lan - guage, Deiseal, from two words signifying the righl hand and the sun, in allusion to the mystical object of the ceremony and the peculiar manner in which it was per - fbrmed Hence we find, in the universal prevalence of this ceremony, and in the invariable mode of passing from (lie east to the west by way of the south, with, con - sequently, the right hand or side to the altar, a pregnant evidence of the common source of all these rites from some primitive origin, to which Free Masonry is also indebted for its existence The circumambulation among the Pagan nations was referred to as the great doctrine of Sahaism, or sun-worship Free Masonry alone has pre - served the primitive meaning, which was a symbolic .i]lusion to the sun as the source of physical light, and the most wonderful work of the Grand Architect of the Universe The reason assigned for the ceremony in the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"xv.stichtingargu~i ii xv. stichtingargus. n I xv.stichtingargus.n I xv.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. iii w. stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargllN 0 nl xv.stichi i~ga rgtIh 0 nl xv. stich t ii l~tl i~ ituil xv.stichtiIlt~lll’~tv~ iii xv.sticht I Ilf3Lll~tlrJ iii xv.such Ii ll~ll I~1if~. ill xv.sIicItIiIl[’Ihi pun hI q 66 MANUaL OF THE LODGE. modern lectures of WEBB and Cioss is absolutely beneath criticism. The Lodge represents the world; the three principal officers represent the sun In his three principal positions—at rising, at meridian, and at setting. The circumambulation, therefore, alludes to the apparent course of the solar orb, through these points, around the world. This Is with us its astronomical symbolism. But its intellectual symbolism is, that the circumambula - tion and the obstructions at various points refer to the labors and difficulties of the student in his progress from Intellectual darkness or ignorance to intellectual light or TRUTH. The following passage of Scripture is used during the ceremony: Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together In unity I It is like the precious ointment upon Ihe head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard; that went down to the skirts of his garments: As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upnn the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord com - manded the blessing, even life for evermore.—Psalin CXXXIII. The great teaching of this Psalm is Brotherly Love, that virtue which forms the most prominent tenet of the Masonic Order. And it teaches the lesson, too, pre - cisely as we do, by a symbol, comparing it to the precious ointment used in the consecration of the High Priest, whose delightful perfume filled the whole place with its odor. The ointment was poured upon the head in such quantity, that, being directed by the anointer in different ways in the form of a cross, it flowed at length down the beard, and finally dropped from the flowing skirts of the priestly garment. ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREe. The fifteen Psalms, from the 120th to the 184th, Inclu - sive, of which this, of course, is one, are called by the Hebrews, “songs of degrees,” because they were sung on the fifteeen steps ascending from the court of Israel to the court of the women in the Temple. The best commentators think that the 133rd Psalm is intended to represent the exultation of the Priests and Levites returned from the captivity at Babylon, and again united in the service of God in the sanctuary How appropriate, then, is its adoption in this degree to com - memorate the approaching release of a neophyte from the darkness in which he had been long wandering, and his admission into a society whose dwelling place is intended as a representation of that glorious Temple at whose portals the very hymn of rejoicing was formerly sung. The candidate will not, of course, at the time understand the allusion, but there is a striking analogy between the liberated Jew going up from the thralidom of Babylon to join once more with his brethren in the true worship on “the threshing-floor of Oman the Jeb - usite,” and the candidate for Masonry, coming out of the blindness and darkness of the profane world, to search for light and truth within the sacred precincts of the Lodge. THE THREE GATES OF THE TEMPLE. DR. DALcHO, in his “Orations,” has found great fault with the York rite of Masonry, because it has in its cere - monies perpetrated the error of furnishing the Temple of Solomon with three gates—.one at the south, one at the west, and one at the east—while in truth there was but one gate to the Temple, and that was in the porch at the east end. But the real error lies with Da. DAI.cHO, who has mistaken a symbolic allusion for a historical state - ment.

The circumambulation and the three supposed gates, referred to and explained in this section of the lecture, are symbolical of the progress of every man in his journey in search of Truth, the great object of all Masonic labor, and of the embarrassments and obstructions that he must meet with in that search Hence our French brethren call this cucumambulation a voyage, and each voyage is typi - cal of some danger or trial of human life THE OBLIGATION OF SECRECY The duty of an Entered Apprentice is embraced by the virtues of silence and secrecy Speaking of the origin of those duties among Masons is the primitive idolatry which prevailed upon the earth (immediately after the Deluge), it became necessary for those who held to the worship of the true God to form themselves into a distinct order—not only those who were of the children of lame], but also others, who retained the traditions of Israel’s God, though of Gentile blood. The time arrived *Lecture on the “Symbolism of Free Masonry,” p 15 ‘7 ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE. when openly to worship the true God was attended with dau 9 er; and then it was that our hrethren had special recourse to hieroglyphics and symbols to preserve secrecy, lest they should be exposed to the arm of persecution. But as, indeed, the arcana or recondite points of religion were always in possession of the priests alone, among the different idolatrous peoples; and as peculiar forms of initiation were practiced hy them, attended with the greatest secrecy (not to say with positive danger to the candidate), the same practice was resorted to by the votaries of the true God, at least so far as secrecy was concerned—secrecy from that time forth ranking as a virtue among Masons, and justly so. Again, to pre - serve the privileges of the Order, strict secrecy wa~ observed, lest those privileges should become abused Among the ancients, secrecy stood high as a mark of wisdom. CALcovr, also, on this subject says: “If we turn our eyes back to antiquity, we shall find that the ild Egyptians had so great a regard for silence and secrectj in the mysteries of their religion that they set up the god HARPOCRATEs, to whom they paid particular honor and veneration, who was represented with his right hand placed near the heart, and the left down by his side, covered with a skin, before full of eyes and ears, to signify that, of many things to he seen and heard, few are to be published.” THE UNWRITTEN LANXIMAEK5. The instructions which constitute the hidden or esoteric knowledge in Free Masonry are forbidden to be written, and can only be communicated by oral intercourse of one Mason with another. This is another instance of the great antiquity of the usage of Free Masonry, which is presenting such collateral evidences of its venerable age."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"w.stichtingarguN,l it w.stichtingargus,n I w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus. ni w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichti ngargtis. ot w.stichti ngargLlN.l il ~v.sticht ill llI’~At!1 iii ~v.stich Ii I1~l.il~i IF] iii x~i.St (‘lit IfIf.~lli pun Ill q 70 MANUAL OF THE LODGE. In all the ancient mysteries, the same reluctance to commit the esoteric instructions of the hierophants to writing is apparent, and hence the secret knowledge taught in their initiations was preserved in symbols, the true meaning of which was closely concealed from the profane. The Druids had a similar regulation; and Cmsar Informs us that it was not considered lawful to intrust their sacred verse to writing; but these were always committed to memory by their disciples. The same custom prevailed among the Jews with respect to the Oral Law, which was never mt rusted to books; but, heing preserved in the memories of the priests and wise men, was handed down, from one to the other, through a long succession of ages. MariirONmas has described, according to the Rabbinical traditions, the mode adopted by MosEs to impress the principles of this Oral Law. The secret doctrine of the Cabala, or the mystical philosophy of the Hebrews, was, also, communicated in an oral form, and, says MADESCE, “transmitted, verbally, down to all the great characters celebrated in Jewish antiquity—among whom both DAvm and SOLOMON were deeply conversant in its most hidden mysteries. Nobody, however, had ventured to commit anything of this kind to paper.” The Christian Church in the age Immediately suc - ceeding the Apostolic, observed the same custom of oral instruction. The early Fathers were eminently cautious not to commit certain of the mysterious dogmas of their religion to writing, lest the surrounding pagans should be made acquainted with what they could neither under - stand nor appreciate. ST. Basia, treating of this sub - ject, In the fourth century, says: “We receive the dogmas transmitted to us by writing and those which have ENTERED APPRENTIcE DEGREE. 71 descended to us from the Apostles, beneath the mystery of oral tradition for several things have been handed to us without writing, lest the vulgar, too familiar with our dogmas, should lose a due respect for them.” A custom so ancient as this, of keeping the landmarks unwritten, and one so invariably observed by the Masonic fraternity, we may very naturally presume, must have been originally established with the wisest intentions; and as the usage was adopted by many other institutions, whose organization was similar to that of Free Masonry, we may also suppose that it was connected with the character of an esoteric instruction. The following passage of Scripture is here used: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

The material light which sprung forth at the fiat of the Grand Architect, when darkness and chaos were dis - persed, has ever been, in Masonry, a favorite symbol of that intellectual illumination which it Is the object of the Order to Create in the minds of its disciples, whence we have justly assumed the title of “Sons of Light.” This mental illumination—this spiritual light, which, after hi. new birth, is the first demand of the candidate, is but another name for Divine Truth—the truth of God and the soul—the nature and essence of both—which con - stitute the chief design of all Masonic teaching.

But what mind can conceive, or what pen portray, that terrible convulsion of nature, that awful disentan - glement of its elements, which must have accompanied the Divine command, “Let there he light I” The attempt to describe it would be a presumptuous task. We feel, when we meditate on the subject, that stillness and silence must have fled before the Almighty Voice, and the earth Itself have trembled in its new existence, when the gloomy pall of darkness was rolled as a curtain from the face of nature. And in Masonry, by the Shock of Enliqhtenment, we seek, humbly, indeed, and at an inconceivable distance, to preserve the recollection and to emhody the idea of the birth of material light by the representation of the cir - cumstances that accompanied it, and their reference to the birth of intellectual or Masonic light. The one is the type of the other; and hence the illumination of the can - didate is attended with a ceremony that may be sup~ posed to imitate the primal illumination of the universe— most feehly, It Is true, and yet not altogether without impressiveness. The Shock of Hnlightenwsent Is, then, a symbol of the change which is now taking place in the intellectual con - dition of the candidate.

THE LAMU5EJN APRON. The use of the apron, or some equivalent mode of investiture as a mystic symbol, was common to all the religious systems of antiquity. Among the Israelites, the girdle formed a part of the investiture of the priest - hood. In the Persian mysteries of MrrzeaAs the candi - date was Invested with a white apron. In the Brahm - Inical Initiations of Hindostan, the Zennaar,- or sacred Lord, was substituted for the apron. The Essenians clothed their novices with a white robe. Even the Japan - ese, in their rites of initiation, invest their candidate with a white apron. The color of a Mason’s apron should be pure urldte, because this color has in all ages and countries been deemed an emblem of purity and innocence. Thus, In the early ages of the Christian Church, the newly-bap - tized convert was invested with a white robe, to denote that he had been cleansed from his former sins, and was thenceforth to lead a life of purity. With a similar mean - ing, the same undefiled color has been preserved in the apron of the Free Mason. tThere Is no such Order as the Knights Of the Roman Eagle. The expre~mon (which is an unhappy one) probably refers to the fact that the Eagle was the standard of the ancient Roman Empire. ITbe Order of the Garter, the most noble of the nritlsh orders of knIghthood. wiss Instituted In 1544. by Edward HI. The Star and I he Garter are the insignia bestowed upon and worn by a knIght. r EaTERED APPRENTIcE DEGREE. 77 The material of a Mason’s apron must be lambakfta. No other substance, such as linen, silk or satin, can be substituted, without entirely destroying the symbolic character of the apron, because the lamb has in all ages been deemed the appropriate emblem of innocence. The true Masonic apron should, then, be of unspotted lambskin, from 14 to 16 inches wide, and from 12 to 14 inches deep, with a fall about 8 or 4 inches deep, square at the bottom, with sharp angular corners, and without device or ornament of any hind. The usage of the craft in this country has, within a few years past, allowed a narrow edging of blue rihbon, in allusion to that uni - versal friendship which Is the bond of the Society, and of which virtue blue is the symhol. But this, undoubt. edly, Is an innovation, for the ancient apron was without any edging or ornament. All extraneous ornaments and devices are in bad taste, and detract from the symbolic character of the investiture. But the silk or satin aprons, bespangled, and painted, and embroidered, which have been gradually creeping into our Lodges, have no sort of connection with Ancient Craft Masonry They are an innovation of French origin, which qhould be per - sistently discouraged by all who admire the simplicity and beauty of our symhols. A Mason who duly and truly appreciates the symhnlic meaning of his apron would no more tolerate a linen one for its economy, or an embroidered satin one for its decorations, than an artist would a gilded statue. The lamhskin, and the lambskin alone, is the badge “more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle, and more honorable than the Star and the Garter.” Tnz Noa’rHEAsr CORNER.

This symbolic reference of the corner stone of a material edifice to a Mason when at his first initiation, he commences the moral and intellectual task of erecting a spiritual temple in his heart, is beautifully sustained when we look at all the qualities that are required to constitute a “well-tried, true, and trusty” corner stone. The squareness of its surface, emblematic of morality— Its cubical form, emblematic of firmness and stability of character—and the peculiar finish and fineness of the material, emblematic of virtue and holiness—show that the ceremony of the northeast corner of the Lodge was undoubtedly intended to portray, in the consecrated lan - guage of symbolism, the necessity of integrity and sta - bility of conduct, of truthfulness and uprightness of character, and of purity and holiness of life, which just at that time and in that place the candidate is moSt liD - pressively charged to maintain. THE WORKINO Toor.s The working tools of an Entered Apprentice are the Twenty-four-inch Gauge and the Common Gavel. The Twenty-f our-inch Gauge is an instrument used by operative masons to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time. It being divided into twenty-four equal parts, Is emblematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts; whereby are found eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother; eight for our usual vocations; and eight for refreshment and sleep - The Common Gavel is an instrument made use of by operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of It for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and super. fluities of life; therehy fitting our minds as living stones for that spiritual building, that house “not made with nands, eternal in the heavens.” This presentation of the working tools of a stone - mason to the candidate must necessarily attract his attention to the fact that there is a connection between the operative art and the speculative science, which con - nection simply consists in this, that speculative Masonry Is the application and sanctification of the working tools and implements, the rules and principles of operative Masonry, to the veneration of God and the purification of the heart. The Operative Masons at Jerusalem, from whom we date our origin, were occupied in the construction of an earthly and material temple, to be dedicated to the serv - ice and worship of God—a house in which the mighty Jehoyah was to dwell visibly by the Shekinab, and whence he was, by Urim and Thummin, to send forth his oracles for the government and direction of his chosen people. The Speculative Mason Is engaged in the construction of a spiritual temple in his heart, pure and spotless, fit for the dwelling place of Him who is the author of purity; where God is to be worshiped in spirit and in truth, and whence every evil thought and unruly passion"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"w.stichtingarguN,ill w.stichtingargus,n I w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl w. stiebtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv stichtingargus .nl xv stichtingargus.nl xv .stichtingargus.nl xv - stichtingargus.nl xv stichtingargus .nI xv .stichtingargus.nI ~w. stichtingargus . n I w.stichtingargus. n I ~w.stlchtingargLls. 01 xvstichti ngargus. a I ~w.stichti ngarguN~ iii xv.stichti flgai~gLl~4~ld ~w.StiCI1t I iil}~i 1b 0 11I ~xv.stic I•i iii lI~ll I’MIlb iii ~xv.sticI iii l4Mil~ii!T lii 1 80 MANUAL OF THE LODGE. are to be banished, as the sinner and the Gentile were excluded froni the sanctuary of the Jewish Temple. In the symbolic language of Masonry, therefore, the twenty-four inch gauge is a symbol of time well em~ played; the common gavel, of the purification of the heart. In the Ancient Mysteries, the first step taken by the candidate was a lustratlon or purification. The candi - date was not permitted to enter the sacred vestihule, or to take any part in the secret formula of initiation, until by water or fire he was emblematically purified from the corruptions of the world which he was about to leave behind. A similar principle exists In Free Masonry where the first symbols presented to the Entered Appren - tice are those which inculcate a purification of the heart, of which the purification of the body in the Ancient Mysteries was symbolic. We no longer make use of the bath or the fountain, because in our philosophical system the symhollsm Is more abstract; but we present the candidate with the apron, the gauge, and the gavel, as symbols, of a spiritual purification. The design Is the same, but the mode In which it is accomplished is different. In former times, before the general use of writing, men were accustomed to avail themselves of any imperish - able substance as a memorial of some transaction, the record of which would now be committed to paper or parchment. Hence we find in the primitive Christian Church, that a fish-shaped die was use as a certificate of membership, and was so recognized from town to town ENTERED APPRENTICE DEOaEE. 81 and from church to church Especially was a piece of metal or ivory made use of by the ancients as a token of a pledge of amity. Being broken into two pieces, the host, when he had entertained a stranger who was about to depart, gave the guest one part while he retained the other; and these broken pieces served in all times after - wards as a memorial of the pledge of friendship that had been thus inaugurated. It may be that the Masonic custom of asking for the deposit of something of the kind in the ARcHIvEs OF ThE LODGE as a memorial, may have reference to this custom. The candidate is sup - posed to be thus giving his pledge of fidelity to the Institution. But the subsequent part of the ceremony would teach him that no material and tangible pledge is really wanted, but that the true pledge of Masonic friendship is deposited in the heart. At a future period, in the next section, an opportunity is taken to exemplify the practical application of the pledge thus made, by an impressive charge on the nature of charity. SECOND SECTION. The second section of the first lecture, according to the system prevailing in this country, is occupied with an explanation of the symbolic meaning of the cere - monies that are detailed in the first; without, therefore, a knowledge of the second section, the first becomes barren and insignificant. It must, however, be con - fessed that many of the interpretations given in this section are unsatisfactory to the cultivated mind, and seem to have been adopted on the principle of the old Egyptians, who made use of symbols to conceal rather than to express their thoughts. Learned Masons have been, therefore, always disposed to go beyond the mere technicalities and stereotyped phrases of the lectures, and to look in the history and the philosophy of the ancient religions, and the organization of the ancient"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargti~,zi I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv - stiebtingargus .nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 xv - stichtingargus.nl xv - stichfingargus.nl xv stichtingargus.nI xv.stichtingargus.n I ~w. stichtingargus.n I wstichtingargus . n I ~w,stichti ngargu8. 01 xv.stichti ngargu8. 01 xvstichti ngargu8 ut xvstichtingarguh.oI xvstichl i n~ li~liN Ill XVStlCll1iIlf~i1If~ilt~ iii q 82 MANUAL OF TEE LODGE. mysteries, for a true explanation of most of the symbols of Masonry, and there they have always been enabled to find this true interpretation. The usual lecture is, how - ever, still preserved as a brief mode of acquiring a gen - eral knowledge of the mode of Masonic instruction, and as furnishing sufficient proof of the definition that “Free Masonry is a system of morality vailed in allegory and illustrated by symbols.” PREPARATION. There is much analogy between the preparation of the candidate in Masonry and the preparation for entering the Temple, as practiced among the ancient Israelites. The Talmudical treatise entitled “Beracoth” prescribed the regulation in these words: “No man shall enter into the Lord’s house with his staff (an offensive weapon), nor with his outer garment, nor with shoes on his feet, nor with money in his purse.” a a * * a Various passages of Scripture are referred to in this section as elucidating the traditions of Masonry on the subject of the Temple. And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa~ and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem.— 2 Chron. II, 16.

Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave It to his neighbor: and this was a testimony In Israel.— Ruth IV, 7. In the Ancient Mysteries the aspirant was always kept for a certain period in a condition of darkness. Hence darkness became the symbol of initiation. Ap - plied to Masonic symholism, it is intended to remind the candidate of his ignorance. which Masonry is to enlighten; of his evil nature, which Masonry is to purify; of the world, in whose obscurity he has been wandering, and from which Masonry Is to rescue him. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.—Matthew VII, 7. •j4 In the ancient initiations the candidate was never per - mitted to enter on the threshold of the temple or sacred cavern in which the ceremonies were to be conducted, until by the most solemn warning he had heen Inipressed with the necessity of caution, secrecy, and fortitude. PEA-yEn. As Masons, we are taught never to commence any great or important undertaking without first invoking the blessing and protection of Deity, and this is because Masonry is a religious institution, and we thereby show our dependence on and our trust in God. ENTERED APPRENTIcE DEGREE. 85 A BELIEF IN Gon. This constitutes the sole creed of a Mason—at least~ the only creed that he is required to profess. But such a profession Is essentially and absolutely necessary, because, without a belief in a superintending Power, with the inevitable deduction from the purity and holiness of such a Being, that sin will be punished and virtue rewarded, there would be no sanction to a moral law, for the atheist would have no motive to keep a promise or to preserve an obligation. THE LEFT SinE. The left aide has always, apparently for a well known physical reason, been deemed inferior to the right. The right side Is the side of honor. “To sit on the right side of the king” was a mark of great favor. And the ancients were so impressed with this fact, that among them the words for left and unlucky were synonymous, as were also those for right and fortunate. The same peculiarity exists In our own language, where sinister means both left and inauspicious. THE RIG ~T HAND. The right hand has in all ages been deemed an emblem of fidelity, and our aiicient brethren worshiped Deity under the name of Fides or Fidelity, which was some - times represented by two right hands joined, and some - times by two human figures, holding each other by the right hands. a a a NussA was the first who erected an altar to FinEs, under which name the goddess of oaths and honesty wee"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"w.stichtingarguN,i ii w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv .stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv stichtingargus. n I ~w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. ni ~w. stichtingargu~i. ri I xv.stichti ngargu8. n I wstichtingargu8.

THE FIRsT INsrauc’rloNs. The candidate receives those first instructions whereon to erect his future moral and Masonic edifice in a partic - ular part of the Lodge, because as on the night of his initiation he commences the greal task, which is never in his future Masonic life to be discontinued, of erecting in his heart a spiritual temple for the indwelling of God, of which the great material ‘remple at Jerusalem was but the symbol; and as each new duty which he learns, and each new virlue ihat he practices, becomes a living stone in ihat temple, it is proper that, respecting the whole system of symbolism, he should begin the labor of erecting a spiritual temple just as the Operative mason would commence the consiruction of his material temple, by first laying the corner stone on which the future edifice is to arise. His first instructions constitule that corner stone, and on it, when laid in its proper place, he constructs the moral and Masonic temple of his life. THE LESSON OF CHARITY. Although Free Masonry is indebted for its origin to its religious and philosophic character, yet charity, in the ordinary adaptation of relief of the distressed, becomes, ‘MoNTFAUcoN mentions several medals In whici’ Fmiu was represented by two hands joined together, which, be says. “warn the most usual symbol.” ENTEREII APPRENTICE DEGIEE. although incidentally, a prominent feature In its teach - ings. And hence it has been well said that there Is no Institution whose laws more strongly enforce, or whose precepts more earnestly inculcate, the virtue of charity.

The third section of the Entered Apprentice’s lecture explains the nature and principles of our Constitution, and furnishes many interesting details relating to the Form, Supports, Covering Furniture, Ornaments, Lights, and Jewels of a Lodge, how it should be situated, and to whom dedicated. Nearly the whole of this section has been made monitormal. Wsss, and after him Csoss, HARDLE, TAN~e - HILL, and all other monitorial writers, have left but little of it unpublished. I have, on the same principle, slightly increased the amount of information given, by the pub - lication of one or two passages, hitherto excepted from publication in other monitors, since I could discover no reason why this exception should have been made.

Bible, Square, and Compasses are present. It is legally co,sststuted when it is acting under the authority of a Warrant of Constitution, which is an instrument written and printed on parchment or paper (but properly it should be on the former), emanating from the Grand Lodge in whose jurisdiction the Lodge is situated, and signed by the grand officers, which authorizes the per - sons therein named, and their successors, to meet as Masons and perform Masonic labor. As no assemblage of Masons Is legal without such an instrument, it is not only the privilege, but the duty, of every Mason on his first visit to a strange Lodge, to demand a sight of its Warrant of Constitution; nor should any brother sit in a Lodge whose members are unwilling to exhibit the authority on which they act. Our ancient brethren met on the highest hills and in the lowest valleys, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, and to guard against sur - prise. ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE. The reason assigned in the lecture for this assembling on high places is the modern, but not the true one. The fact is, that mountains and other high places were almost aiwayr considered as holy, and peculiarly appropriate for religious purposes, and we have abundant evidence in Scripture that the Jews were accustomed to worship on the tops of the highest hills, as it was believed that sacrifices offered from these elevated piaces were most acceptable to the Diety. I-IUTcHINsoN says that “the highest hills and the lowest valleys were, from the earliest times, esteemed sacred, and it was supposed that the Spirit of God was peculiarly diffusive in those places” A Lodge is said, symbolically, 10 extend in length from east to west; in breadth, from north to south; in height, from the earth to the highest heavens; in depth, from the surface to the center. A Lodge is said to be of these vast dimensions to denote the universality of Masonry, and to teach us ihat a Mnson’s charity should be equally as extensive. There is a peculiar fitness in this theory, which is really only making the Masonic Lodge a symbol of the world. It must be remembered that, at the era of the Temple, the earth was supposed to have the form of a parallelogram, or “oblong square.” Such a figure \\‘.s~lIiliII~iil[’ll— iii"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"w. stichtingarguN .111 w.stichtingargus,ii I w.stichtingargus,n I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w stichtingargus .nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w .stichtingargus. n I ~w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. n I ~w.stichtingargu~. ni w.stichtingarguN. id ~w.stichtingar~uN. iii ~xv. stichi i n~iir~i in, ill ~w.stic h ii n~ii i’{~i it~ if ~w.stich t I ngii “~~un Id ~w.sticIi t I ~ iii I 90 MANUAL OF THE LOnGE.

Beyond, far In the north, would be the Cimmerian deserts as a place of darkness, while the pillars of Hercules in the west, on each side of the Straits of Gades—now Gibraltar— might appropriately be referred to the two pillars that stood at the porch of the Temple. Thus the world itself would be the true Mason’s Lodge, in which he was to live and labor. Again~ the solid contents of the earth below, “from the surface to the center,” and the profound expanse above, “from the earth to the highest heavens,” would give to this parallelogram the outlines of a double cube, and meet thereby that definition which says, that “the form of the Lodge ought to be a double cube, as an expressive emblem of the powers of light and darkness in the creation.~~* A Lodge has three principa] supports, which are Wfs - dom, Strength, and Beauty, because it is necessary that there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertak - ings.

The idea, that the Lodge Is a symbol of the world, is still carried out. It was the belief of the ancients that the heavens, or the roof of the world, was supported by pillars. By these pillars, some suppose that the moun - tains are alluded; but In reference to a passage in Job XXVI, Ii, where it Is said “The pillars of heaven trem - ble,” Novas thinks that “it Is more probable that heaven is represented as an immense edifice, supported on lofty columns, like a temple.” But on this passage D~. CUT - 5U5H is still more explicit. He says~ “The arch, in this instance, Is allegorical not only of the arch of heaven, but of the higher degree of Masonry, commonly called the Holy Royal Arch. The pillars which support the arch are emblematical of wisdom and strength—the former denoting the wisdom of the Supreme Architect, and the latter the stability of the universe.”—Brewster’s Eacyelop., A sn.rseais Edst~osi.

The greatest of these is Charity; for our Faith may be lost in sight; Rope ends in fruition; but Charity extenas beyond the grave, through the bouhdless realm of eternity. The Lodge continues throughout this degree to be presented to the initiate as a symbol of the world, and hence its covering is figuratively supposed to be the “clouded canopy” on which the host of stars is repre - sented. If the Lodge represent the world, then its cover - ing must be represented by the blue vault of heaven. The mystical ladder, which is here referred to, is a symbol that was widely diffused among the religions of antiquity, where, as in Masonry, it was always sup - ~ssed to consist of seven steps, because seven was a sacred number. in some of the Ancient Mysteries, the seven steps represented the seven planets, and then the sun was the topmost, in others they represented the seven metals, and then gold was the topmost; in the Brahminical mysteries they represented the seven worlds which constituted the Indian univerac, and then the world of Truth was the highest. The seven steps of the Masonic ladder are Tern peraace, Fortitude, Prudence, Justice. Faith, Hope, and Charity; that is, the tour cardinal and the three theological virtues. Now, as charity is love, and as the sun represents Divine Love, and as also the astronomical sign of the sun is gold, and as truth is the synonym of God, it is evident that the topmost round in all these ladders, whether it be the sun, or gold, or truth, or charity, conveys exactly the same lesson of symbolism, namely, that the Mason, liv- big and working In the world as his Lodge, must seek"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"w. stichtingarguN, iii w.stichtingargus,n I w. stichtingargu s.n I w. stichti ngargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv .stichtingargus.n] xv. stichtingargus.n] xv.stichtingargus. ni xv.stichtingargus. iii xv .stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingarguN. iii xv. stichti ngargLlN. iii xv.stichti ngar~tiN, iii xv.stichti ngtli’gI l~.

The furniture of a Lodge consists of a Ho]y Bible, Square, and Compasses. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God; the Square, to the Master, and the Compasses, to the craft. The Bible is dedicated to God, because it is the ines - timable gift of God to man; the Square, to the Master, because it is theproper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compasses, to the craft, because, by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe their desires, and keep their passions within due bounds. The ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, checked with good and evil; the beautiful border which surrounds it is emblematical of those manifold blessings and comforts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hiero— glyphically represented by the blazing star in the center.

The Blazing Star is said by WREn to be “commemora - tive of the star which appeared to guide the wise men of the East to the place of our Saviour’s nativity.” This, which is one of the ancient interpretations of the symbol, being considered as too sectarian in its character, and unsuitable to the universal religion of Masonry, has been omitted since the meeting of the Grand Lecturers at Baltimore, in 1842."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"w.stiChtingarguN,l1 I w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stiChtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus .nl ~w.stiChtingargus.n1 ~w. stiChtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 w.stiChtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus .nl ~w .stichtingargus.nl • stichtingargus.nl ~w .stichtingargus .nl vv . stichtingargus.nl stichtingargus .n] ~w.stichtingargus.nI stichtingargus. n I ~w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargu~.nI w.stichuingargus.nI w.stichti ngarguN.

A Lodge has three symbo]ic lights; one of these Is In the East, one in the West, and one in the South. There Is no light in the north, because King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was placed so far north of the ecliptic, that the sun and moon, at their meridian height, cou]d dart no rays into the north - em part thereof. The north we, therefore, masonically call a place of darkness. The three lights, like the three principal officers and the three principal supports, refer undoubtedly to the three stations of the sun—its rising in the east, Its merid - Ian in the south, and its setting In the west—and thus the symbolism of the Lodge, as typical of the world, con - tinues to be preserved. The use of lights in all religious ceremonies is an ancient custom. There was a seven-branched candlestick in the tabernacle, and In the Temple “were the go]den candlesticks, five on the right hand and five on the left.’ They were always typical of moral, spiritual, or Intel - lectual light. A Lodge has six jewe]s; three of these are Immova - ble and three movable. r ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE. The immovable jewels are the Square, Level, and Plumb. The square incu]cates morality; the level, equality; and the plumb, rectitude of conduct. They are called immovable jewels, because they are always to be found in the East, West, and South parts of the Lodge, being worn by the officers in those respec - tive stations. The movable jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle~Board.* The rough ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The perfect ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adjusted by the working tools of *Such is the division of the jewels in the Lodges of this eoun - try: but in English Lodges the reverse is the ease: there the rough and perfect ashlars and the trestle board are the Immov - able Jewels, and the square, level, and plumb are the mom - ble, hecause they descend from one set of officers to their suo. cessors. ~X\\’.SIl(Ihtlll~’ilIIYIi iii"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargu~. d w. stichtingargus• ii I w. stichtingargu s.n I w.stichti ngargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.n] xv. stichtingargus.n] xv. stichtingargus . ni xv.stichtingargus. n I xv.stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingargus. iii xv. stichti ngargtlN. n I xv.stichtingargii~ iii xvsticht i ngal~tl~. iii xvstichli ngi ir~i i~ lii xv.stichli n~l.lI-~~l;i w~, ill xv.stich Ii ll~4lll~4IW. iil xvsiich liii giII’puh~uI xv siicIilili~iil}~ii~ iii MANUAL OW TEE Lonog. the fellow-craft. 1’he trestle-board Is for the master workman to draw his designs upon. By the rough ashlar we are reminded of our rude and Imperfect state by nalure; by the perfect ashlar, that state of perfection at which we hope to arr]ve by a virtuous education, our own endeavor, and the blessing of God; and by the trestle-board we are also reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal build - Ing agreeably to the ru]es and designs laid down by the master on his trestle-board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great books of nature and revelation, which are our spiritual, moral, and masonic trestle-board. To every Mason. whatever may be his peculiar religious creed, that revelation of the Deity which is recognized by his religion becomes his trestle-board. Thus, the trestle-board of the Jewish Mason is the Old Testament; of the Christian, the Old and the New; of the Moham - medan, the Koran. But as no operative mason can work without a trestle-board, where the designs and instruc - tions of his master for his conduct in the building on which he Is engaged may be delineated, so no speculative mason can labor truly and profitably in the grc’it work of life without a trestle-board which may contain the delineation of the designs and will of his Eternal Master. And thus it is that, as the atheist acknowledges no such Master, and can, therefore, have no such trestle-board., he is not permitted to unite with us in our “moral, spirit - ual, and masonic” labor. And this Is really the reason of the law which forbids the Initiation of atheists.

This tabernacle was an exact pattern of King Solomon’s Temple, of which every *Diu OLVEB assigns the followIng reasons why the tabernacle is considered as the type of a Masons Lodge: ‘lt was an oblong square, and, with Its courts and appendages, It repre - sented the whole habitable globe.

The sacred roll of God’s revealed will and law was deposIted in the Ark of the Covenant; the same holy record Is placed In a eon - spicuous part of our Lodge. The altar of Incense was a double cube, and so is our pedestal and stone of foundation. The covering of the tabernacle was composed of three colors, as a representation of the celestIal hemisphere; such, also. is the covering of a Mason’s Lodge.

Lodge is a representation, and it is, or ought, therefore, to be placed due east and west, The orieatatioi of Lodges, or their position due east and west, is derived from the universal custom of antiquity. “The heathen temples,” says DUDLEY, “were so constructed that their length was directed toward the east, and the entrance was by a portico at the western front, where the altar stood, so that the votaries ap - proaching for the performance of religious rites, directed their faces toward the east, the quarter of sunrise.” The primitive reason for this custom undoubtedly Is to be found in the early prevalence of sun-worship, and hence the spot where that luminary first made his ap - pearance in the heavens was consecrated, in the minds of his worshipers, as a place entitled to peculiar rever - ence. Long after the reason had ceased, the custom con - tinued to be observed, and Christian churches still are built, when circumstances will permit, with particular reference to an east-and-west position. Free Masonry, retaining in its symbolism the typical reference of the Lodge to the world, and constantly alluding to the sun in his apparent diurnal revolution, imperatively requires, when it can be done, that the Lodge should be situated due east and west, so that every ceremony shall remind the Mason of the progress of that luminary. Our ancient brethren dedicated their Lodges to King Solomon, because he was our first Most EEcellent Grand Master; but modern Masons dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry; and since their time, there is represented, in every regular and well governed Lodge, a certain point within a circle, embordered by two per - pendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Bap - ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE. 101 tist and St. John the Evangelist; and upon the top rests the Holy Scriptures. The point represents an individual brother; the circle is the boundary line, beyond which he Is never to suffer his prejudices or passions to betray him. In going round this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as the Holy Scripture; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within these due bounds, it is impossible that he should materially err. The point within a circle is an interesting and Impor - tant synubol in Free Masonry, but ii has been so debased In the interpretation of it given in the modern lectures, that the sooner that interpretation Is forgotten by the Masonic student, the better will It be. The symbol i’ really a beautiful but somewhat abstruse allusion to the old sun-worship."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"102 MANUAL OP THE LODGE.

It was originally the conservator of a genuine moral precept, founded on a fundamental religious truth; but innovation followed innovation, until this degraded symbol became the dreadful depository of obscenity and lust. The use of this emblem Is coeval with the first created man. A primary idea which would suggest itself to the mind of Adam, when engaged in reflections on his own sit - uation, the form of the universe, and the nature of all the objects presented to his view, would be, that the creation zva~ a circle a,td himgelf the center. This figure, im - planted without an effort, would be ever present in all his contemplations, and would influence his judgment to a certain extent, while altempting to decide on the mys - terious phenomena which were continually before him. To persons unacquainted with the intricate philosophy of nature, as we may fairly presume Adam was, thu. is the plain idea conveyed to the senses by a superficial view of nature’s works. Ask an unlettered hind of the present day, and he will tell you that the earth is a circular plane; and he will assuredly look upon hLmself as the common center of all. The t~vo parallel Zi~tes, which in the modern lectures are said to represent St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, really allude to particular periods in the sun’s annual course. At two particular points in thi~, course the sun is found on the zodiacal signs Cancer and Capricorn, which are distinguished as the summer and winter solstice. When the sun is in these points. he haa reached respectively his greatest northern and southerz~ limit. These points, if we suppose the circle to repre - Bent the sun’s annual course, will be indicated by the point where the parallel lines touch the circle. But the days when the sun reaches these points are the 21st of June and the 22d of December, and this will account for their subsequent application to the two Saints John, whose anniversaries the Church has placed near those days. So the true interpretation of the point within the circle is the same as that of the Master and Wardens of a Lodge. The reference to the symbolism of the world and the Lodge is preserved in both. The Master and Wardens are symbols of the sun—the Lodge, of the universe or the world; the point also is the symbol of the same sun, and the surrOunding circle of the universe, while the two parallel lines really point, not to two saints, but to the two northern and southern limits of the sun’s course. The three great tenets of a Mason’s profession are Brotherly Love, ReUef, and Truth, which are thus described: BROTHERLY Lov~. By the exercise of brotherly love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family; the high and low, rich and poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support, and protect each other. On this prin - ciple, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual diEtance."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"w.stichtingar~uu.i¶~ w.stichtingarguN. ni w.stichtingargu~i.ii I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichti flgargLI~,flI w.stichti ngargu~. a! w.stichti ngargti~EflI ~v.stichti n~ui’~iiu iii q 104 MAN UAL o~ THE LODGE. B.ELXZI. To relieve the distressed, is a duty mcum - bent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misror - tunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendshIps and establish our connections. Tao~z. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foun - dation of every virtue. To be good and true, is the first lesson we are taught In Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct: hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. Every Mason has four * which are illustrated by the four cardinal virtues, Temperance, Fort4tude, Pru— denco, and Justice, and are thus explained: TEMru~AN CE. Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of every Mason; as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or contracting any licentious or vicious babit, the indulgence r ENTERED APPRENTICE DEoui~E. of which might lead him to disclose some of tbose valua - ble secrets which he has promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequently subject him to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons. ~ FoxTrruIrn. Fortitude is that noble and steady purpose of the mmd whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril, or danger, when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally dis - tant from rashness and cowardice; and, like the former, should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every Mason, as a safeguard or security against any Illegal attack that may be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from him any of those valu - able secrets with which he has been so solemnly intrusted, and which were emblematically represented upon his first admission Into the Lodge. PXImENCK. Prudence teaches us toregulateourlivesand~~ actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and Is that habit by which we wisely judge and prudently determine on all things relative to our present as well as to our future happiness. ~ This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government ot his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abruad in the world. It should be particularly attended to in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token or word whereby the secrets of Masonry might be unlawfully obtained. 105"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"w.stichtingal’$Llud¶~ w. stichtingargux.nl w.stichtingargus.

Justice Is that standard, or boundary of right, which enahles us to render to every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with Divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society; and as justice in a great measure onstitutes the real good man, so should it be the ulivarluil)le practice of every Mason never to deviate from the niinu test principles thereof. As an encouragement and example to the candidate, he Is reniinded that our ancient hrethren served their mas - ters with freedom, fer’veacy. and zeai—which qualities are syriiholically illustrated—and the lecture closes with an appropriate reflection on the certainty of death.

The syrnliolisrn of the second degree essentially differs from that of the first. If the first degree was typical of the period of youth, the second is emblematic of the stage of manhood. Here new duties and increased obli - gations to their performance press upon the individual. The lessons of wisdom and virtue which he has received in youth, are now to produce their active fruits; the talent which was lent, is now to be returned with usury. Hence, as the Fellow Craft’s degree is intended to represent this thinking and working period of life, it necessarily assumes a more iuiiportant plisition in the Masonic scale, and Is invested with a more dignified ritual, and a niore exten - sive series of instruction. Here It Is thst the prepara - tory lessons which were obtained in the first degree are to be enlarged and enforced. As lahor is the divinely appointed lot of man, in this degree the regards of indus - try are set forth in emblematic forms, and the recipient Is taught the exercise of diligence and industry, that by the faithful performance of his task he may, In due time, be entitled to the wages for which he has wrought. But man was not intended for physical labor only. There are more exalted tasks to which the possession of mind has called him. Endowed by his Creator with the possession of reason and intellect, it is his duty, and should be his pleasure, to direct the vigor and energy of his manhood to the cultivation of his reasoning facul - ties and the improvement of his intellectual powers. Hence, the Fellow Craft’s degree, as a type of this state of manhood, Is particularly devoted to science."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"w.stichtingar~uu.~ w.stichtingargu~.n1 w.stichtingargus. iii w. stichtingargu s.ri I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus~ lii w.stichti ngarguH. nI ~v.stich II l18111 pi~r~, iii ~v.stich Ii li{’lil [~LIFJ lii ~v.sticht I ipni pun iii q 110 MANUAL OP THE LODGE. The mind of the recipient is fixed, by the nature of Its ritual, upon the wonders of nature and art. The atten - tion is particularly directed to the liberal arts and sciences, with whose principles the candidate is charged to become familiar, that he may be enabled to occupy with honor to himself, and with profit to his fellow creatures, his alloted place in the greal structure of human society. SECOND LECTURE. The lecture of the second degree is divided Into two sections. While it extends the plan of knowledge com - menced in the lecture 01 the first degree, it comprehends a more extensive system of learning, and inculcates, in our particular method, the most important truths of science. Fxssv SEcTION. The first section of the second lecture accurately elucidates the mode of initiation into this degree, and instructs the diligent craftsiiien how to proceed in the proper arrangement of the ceremonies used on the occa - sion. The square, as a symbol, is peculiarly appropriate to this degree. It is intended to teach the Fellow Craft that the square of morality and virtue should be the rule and guide of his conduct In his transactions with all man - kind, but more especially with brother Masons. The following passage of Scripture is introduced dur - ing the ceremonies: Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-llne in his I I I I FELLOW Ca~syr’s DEGREE 111 hand. And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest IhouP And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more.—Amoa VII, 7, 8. The Working Tools of a Fellow Craft are the Plumb, the Square and Ihe Level. The Plumb is an instrument made use of by operative masons to raise perpendiculars; the Square, to square their work; and the Level, to lay horisontals; but we, ifi F as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of them for more noble and glorious purposes: the plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations, before God and men, squaring our actions liy the square of virtue, and remembering that we are traveling upon the level of time to that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns. THE PaEcIous JEWELS OF A Fsaj..ow CUATS. The jewels of a Fellow Craft, like his working tools, and like every other gift that he receives, are altogether of a symbolic nature. They are lessons of instruction which derive their name of jewels from the moral value that they possess. They teach the candidate that the attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Free Masonry arc safely lodged i~ the repository of a faithful breast."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"118 w.stichtingar~um.I¶I w.stichtingarguN. ni w.stichtingarg US. iii w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl W.stiChtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI W.stiChtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I W.stiChtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichti ngargus. iil w.stichting~lr~tl~,It I w.stichti nga r8~jt4,1ll w.stich Ii 11811 FU~IItJ Ill W.StlLhtillpIll pIl~ lii I 112 MANUAL OF THE Lonoe. SECOND SECTION The second section of this degree refers to the combined operative and speculative origin of the Institution:* it de - tails some interesting features relative to the Temple of Solomon and the usages oF our ancient brethren, in the course of which the mind is drawn to the contemplation of themes of science and philosophy. OPERATIVE MASONRy. We work in Speculative Masonry, but our ancient brethren wrought in both Operative and Speculative They worked at the building of King Solomon’s Temple, and many other sacred and important edifices. By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper applica - tion of the useful rules of architecture, whence a struc - ture will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts It Furnishes us with dwellings, and with convenient shelter from the vicissitudes and inclemencies ‘The connection between the operative art and the specula - tive science of Masonry is the first point to which, in this sec - tion, the attention of the candidate is directed Something ought, therefore, to be here said in reference to these two divi - sions Masonry, in its character as an operative art, is familiar to every one As such, it is engaged in the application of the rules of architecture to the construction of public and private edifices It, of course, abounds in the use of technical terms, and makes use of implements and materials which are peculiar to itself. It is the popular theory that the operative Masons were the founders of the system of speculative Masonry, in which they applied the language and ideas of their art of building to a spiritual and religious sense Hence Speculative iilasonry is nothing moie nor less, in this aspect, than a symbolization of Operative Masonry The theory is (and it is not an untenable one), that at first operative Masonry existed simply as an art of building Then the operative Masons, with the assistance of learned and pious men, invented the speculative science, or Free Masonry, and FELLOw CaAFT’s DEOaEE. of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is im - planted in man for the best, most salutary, and benefi - cent purposes. Spscux..aTIvE MAsoNay. By speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the pas - sions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far Interwoven with religion, as to lay us under obligation to pay that rational homage to the Diety which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative Mason to view, with reverence and admira - tion, the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfections of his Divine Creator. tben each became an Integrant part of one undivided system. Not, however, that titers ever was a tIme when every opera - tive Mason. without euiceplion. was acquainted with or initiated Into the speculative science. Even now there are thousands of skillful sto,einijsens who know nothing of the symbolic meaning of the inipleiients tiiey employ. But operative Masonry was at firsi, and is even now, the skeleton upon which was strung the nerves and muscles of tbe living system of Free or Speco - tative Masonry. Speculdtive Masonry, now known as Free Maseiiry. is. Ihere - fore. the scientific application and the religious consecration of the rules and principles, the technical lajiguage and tl,u, Implanients and n,aterlals, of opeiwilve Masouiry to tbe wor - sbip of God as the Grand Architect of the Universe, and to tbe purification of the heart and the inculcation of the dogmas ot a religious philosophy And as the onginal unioii of the opera - tive and speculative branches of t~je system Is traditionally supposed to have taken place at tbe building of the Temple of Jerusalem by King Solomon, more attentIon Is paid In the •ymhohism to that edifice than to any other."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MANUAL oF THE LoneE. 114 115 FELLOW CEAIvT’s Danaga. w.stichtingargu~.nI w.stichtingargus.ii I w. stiChtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargu s. n I w. stiChtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus. i~ I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingarguH.

THE Piu.Aas OF THE PoacH. For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen ciibits high apiece; and a line of twelve cubits did conipass either of them ahout.—l Kings Vii, 15. Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five culilts high, and the chapiter that was on the top of tach of them was five cuhits.—2 Chroa. iii, 15. And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cuhits.—l Kings Vii, 16. The height of the one pillar was eighteen ciibits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter around about, all of brass; and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.—2 Kings XXV, 17. The discrepancy as to the height of the pillars as given in the book of Kings and in Chronicles is to be recon - ciled by supposing that In the book of Kings the pillars are spoken of separately, and that in Chronicles their aggregate height is calculated; and the reason that in this latter book their united height is placed at 85 cuhits, instead of 86, which would be the double of 18, is because they are there measured as they appear with the chapi - ters upon them. Now half a cubit of each pillar was concealed in what Da. Liowrroov calls “the hole of the chapiter,” that Is, half a cubit’s depth of the lower edge of the chapiter covered the top of the pillar, making each pillar apparently only 17½ cubits high, or the two, 85 cubits, as laid down in the book of Chronicles. In a similar way we reconcile the difference as to the height of the chapiters. In 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles the chapiters are said to be jive cubits high. while in I Kings their height Is described as being only three"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"w.stichtinga,’~uu.n1 w.stichtingargu~.n1 w.stichtingargus.ii I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stiChtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.

But It will be noticed that It immediately follows in the same place, that “there was a wreathen work and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about.” Now this expression is conclusive that the height of the chapi - ters was estimated exclusive and independent of the wreathen work round about them, which was two cubits more, and this added to the three cubits of the chapiter proper, will make the five cubits spoken of in all other parts of Scripture.

By order in Architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or it is a regular arrangement of the project - ing parts of the building, which, united with those of a column, torm a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. From the first formation of society, Order in Archi - tecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learned that they tlrst planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed: the Ionic, Done, Corinthian, Tuscan, and Composite. THE IONIc. Bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high, Its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentals. There is both delicacy and ingenuily displayed in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians. as the famous temple of Diana at Ephesus was of this order. It is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young woman, of an elegant shape, dressed in her hair, as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust man. Tin Doasc, Which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornaments on base or capital, except moldings, though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglyphs compose the orna - ments of the frieze.

THE COEINTHIA1~, The richest of the five orders, is deemed a master - piece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is orna - mented with curious devices, the cornice with dentals and modillion. This order is used in stately and superb structures. The Invention of This Order. It was invented at Corinth, by CAJLnwAcHUs, who is said to have taken the hint of the capital of this pillar from the following remarkable cir - cumstances. Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he per - ceived a basket of toys covered with tile, placed over an acanthus root, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encom - passed the basket, till, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction, and bent downward. CALLIMAcHUs, struck with the object, set about imItating the figure; the vase of the capital he made to represent the basket; the abacus, the tile; and the volutes, the bending leaves. THE TUSCAN Is the most simple and solid of the five orders- It was Invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is seven diameters high; and its capital, base, and entablature have but few moldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would he superfluous. FELLOW CaAPT’s DEGaEE. THE COMPOSITE Is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has two rows of leaves of the Corinthian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has quarter-rounds, as the Tuscan and Doric orders; is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentals, or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. OF THE INVENTION OF Oanza IN AacHxvac’rusz The ancient and original Order of Architecture re - vered by Masons, are no more than three—the Ionic, Done, and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Compositc, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian.

To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Bornans, are we indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. Of these five orders, the Tonic, Doric, and Corinthian, as the most ancient, are most esteemed by Masons. The Ionic, from the skill and ingenuity displayed in its con - struction, Is emblematic of the column of Wisdom, which is situated in the east part of the Lodge and Is repre - sented by the Worshipful Master; the Doric, from the massive strength of its structure, is emblematic of the column of Strength, which is situated in the west part of the Lodge, and Is represented by the Senior Warden; and the Corinthian, from the exuberance of Its ornaments, Is emblematic of the column of Beauty, which is situated in the south part of the Lodge, and Is represented by the Junior Warden. Or THE SENSE OF HUMAN NATURE. The five Senses of Human Nature, which are HEARING, SEEING, FEElING, SMELLING and TAsTING, are next re - ferred to and described. Heari sag Is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of society, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires, while thus our reason is capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. FELLOW CRAFT’s DEGnEE. 128 ‘1’he wise and beneficent Author of Nature intended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge by the information of others. For these purposes, we are endowed with hearing, that by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete. Seeing Is that sense by which we distinguish objects, and in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structures, and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of Nature. By this sense, we find our way on the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of the earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of It. By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discoveries in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more, by It we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections, of our fellow creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance would display the hypocrisy to the dis - cerning eye. In fine, the rays of light which administer to this sense are the most astonishing part of the anl~ mated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object ot admiration. Of all the faculties, sight is the noblest. The struc - ture of the eye and its appurtenances evince the admira - ble contrivance of Nature for performing all its various external and internal motions, while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demonstrates this organ to be the masterpiece of Nature’s work."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"w.stichtingar~um.M w.stichtingarguM.rd w.stichtingargus.t d w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.n[ w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargu s. iii w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus ,iii w.stichtingargu~. lii w.stichti ngu i~uwnI ~v.Stichtil18lll’~~ib iii ~V.St!Cl1tifl~Ull’~UU, iii ~v.stich Ii l1~iI rf=~tuJld ~v.Stic lit I flI~ill pAlI?1 Iii I •1 r l24~ MANUAL or v~a LODGE Feeling Is that sense by which we distinguish the different quali - ties of bodies, such as heat and cold, hardness and soft - ness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion, ~nd extension. Smelling Is that sense by which we distinguish odors, the various kinds of which convey different impressions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and, indeed, most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of vast subtility, as well In the state of life and growth, as in the state of fermentation and putrefaction. These effluvia being drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all bodies are smelled. Hence it is evident that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air continually passes in respiration. Tasting Enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situation of both these organs, it le plain that they were intended by Nature to distinguish wLolesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tasting; and by It we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the different compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharmacy, etc. Smelling and tasting are inseparably connected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, that these senses are rendered less fit to per - form their natural offices. FElLow CRAFT’S DEGREE. 125 Of these senses, Hearing, Seeing, and li’eeting have always been highly revered by Masons. * The seven Liberal Arts and Sciences—which are GaAMMAR, RHEvoaic, LOGIc, AaITHI%aaTIc, GEOXETET, Music, and AsvaOiiOMT—are then described. Grammar Teaches the proper arrangement of words, according to the idiom or dialect of any particular people; and that excellency of pronounciation which enables us to speak or write a language with accuracy, agreeably to reason and correct usage. Rhetoric Teaches us to speak copiously and fluently on any sub - ject, not merely with propriety alone, but with all the advantages of force and elegance, wisely contriving to captivate the hearer by strength of argunient and beauty of expression, whether it be to entreat or exhort, to admonish or applaud. Logic Teaches us to guide our reason discretionally in the gen. eral knowledge of things, and directs our inquiries after trulh. It consists of a regular train of argument, whence we infer, deduce, and conclude, according to certain premises laid down, admitted, or granted; and in it are employed the faculties of conceiving, judging, reasoning, and dkposing, all of which are naturally led on from one gradation to another, till the point in question in finally deteruumined. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation, or ground-work, of our inquiries; particularly in the pur~ suit of those sublime principles which claim Our atten. tion as Masons.

By this art, reasons and demonstrations are given for finding out any certain number whose relation or affinity to another is already known or discovered. The greater advancement we make in the mathematical sciences, the more capable we shall be of considering such things as are the ordinary objects of our conceptions, and be thereby led to a more comprehensive knowledge oi our great Creator and the works of the creation. Geometry Treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are con - sidered, from a point to a line, from a line to a super - ficies, and from a superficies to a solid. A point is a dimensionless figure, or an indivisible part of a space. A line is a point continued, and a figure of one capacity, namely, length. A sul)erficies is a figure of two dimensions, namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions, namely, length, breadth, and thickness. The Advantage of Geometry By this science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general, to arrange his soldiers; Ihe geographer, to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the dura - tion of time and the seasons, years and cycles. In fine, geometry is the foundation of architecture, and the root of the mathematics. FELLOW CRAFT’s DEGREE. 12T Music Teaches the art of forming concords, so as to compose de - lightful harmony, by a mathematical and proportional arrangement of acute, grave, and mixed sounds This art, by a series of experiments, is reduced to a demonstrative science, with respect to tones and the intervals of sound. It inquires into the nature of concords and discords, and enables us to find out the proportion between them by numbers Astronomy Is that divine art by which we are taught to read the wis - dom, strength, and beauty of the Almighty Creator in those sacred pages, the celestial hemisphere Assisted by astronomy, we can observe the magnitudes, and calculate the periods and eclipses of the heavenly bodies.

While we are employed in the study of this science, we must per - ceive unparalleled instances of wisdom and goodness, and through the whole creation, trace the glorious Author by his works Here a symbol of Plenty is introduced, and proper ax - planations are given as to the proper answers to the fol - lowing questions What does it denote?

The passages of Scripture which are referred to in this part of Ihe section will be found in Judges XII, 1-6. The Vulgate version gives a paraphra~tic translation of a part of the 6th verse, as follows: “Say, therefore, Shib - boleth, which being interpreted is an ear of corn.” The same word also in Hebrew signifies a rapid stream of water, from the root SHaBaL, to flow copiously. The too common error of speaking, in this part of the ritual, of a “water-ford” instead of a “water-fail,” which is the correct word, must be carefully avoided. A water-fail Is an emblem of plenty, because it indicates an abundance of water. A water-ford, for the converse reason, is, if any symbol at all, a symbol of scarcity. The lecture next proceeds to illustrate The Moral Adr.ianiaqes of Geometry Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Masonry is erected. By geometry, we may curiously trace Nature, through her various windings, to her most concealed recesses.

The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnifi - Cent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Free Masonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The atteativ.~e ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of Free Masonry are safely lodged in the repository of faithful breasta. Tools and instruments of architecture, and symbolic emblems, most expressive, are selected by the fraternity to imprint on the mind wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, are transmitted, unimpaired, the most excellent tenets of our institution,’ m The lecture closes by paying profound homage to the sacred name of the Grand Geometrician of the Universe, before whom all Masons, from the youngest Entered Apprentice who stands in the northeast corner of the Lodge, to the Worshipful Master who presides in the east, humbly, reverently, and devoutly bow. CHARGE AT PASSING TO THE DEGREE or FELLOW CRANT.t Brother: Being passed to the second degree of Ma - sonry, we congratulate you on your preferment. The ‘This descant on Geometry Is, perhaps, one of the oldest passages in our monitoriSi instruction, It originally constituted a part of an address, entitled “A Vindication of Masonry,” delivered on the lath May. 1741, by Brother CHARLES L~LIE, before Vernon Kiiwinning Lodge, In the city of Edinburgh. tThla charge is taken, with hut very little alteration, from WILLIAM PasaroN, who first published it in his “Iliustrationa of Masonry.” FELLOW CRAFT’S DEGREE. 131 internal, and not the external, qualifications of a man are what Masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which, as a Mason, you are hound to discharge, Or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offenses of your brethrcn; but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education which tends so efficiently to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your considera - tion; especially the science of geometry, which is estab - lished as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the wonderful properties of nature, it demonstrates the most important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new character it is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Order, by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagement as a Fellow Craft, and to these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties.

Although the legend of the Winding Stairs forms an important tradition of Ancient Craft Masonry, the only allusion to it in Scripture is to be found in a single verse in the 6th chapter of the 1st Book of Kings, and is in these words: “The door for the middle chamber was In the right side of the house; and they went up with wind - ing stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the mid - dle into the third.” Out of this slender material has been construcied an allegory, which, if properly considered In its symbolical relations, will be found to he of sur - passing beauty. But it Is only as a symbol that we can regard this whole tradition, for the historical facts and the architectural details alike forbid us for a moment to suppose that the legend, as it is rehearsed in the second degree of Masonry, is anything more than a magnificent philosophical myth. Let us inquire into the true design of this legend, and learn the lesson of symbolism which it Is intended to teach. In the investigation of the true meaning of every Masonic symbol and allegory, we must be governed by the single principle that the whole design of Free Ma - sonry as a speculative science is the investigation of divine truth. To this great object everything is sub - sidiary. rhe Mason is, from the moment of his initia - tion as an Entered Apprentice, to the time at which he receives the full fruition of Masonic light, an iiivesti - gator—a laborer in the quarry and the Temple—whose reward is to be Truth, and all the ceremonies and tradi - tions of the Order tend to this ultimate design. Hence there is in Speculative Masonry always a prog - ress, symbolized by its peculiar ceremonies of initiation. There is an advancement from a lower to a higher state— FEaaow CRAs’r’s DEGREE. 188 from darkness to light—from death to life-from error to truth. The candidate is always ascending; he is never stationary; never goes back; but each step he takes brings him to some new mental illumination—to the knowledge of some more elevated doctrine. The teach - ing of the Divine Master is, in respect to this continual progress, the teaching of Masonry—”No man having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven.” And similar to this is the precept of PYTHAGORAS: “When traveling, turn not back, for if you do, the furies will accompany you.” In an investigation of the symbolism of the Winding Stairs, we will be directed to the true explanation by a reference to their origin, their number, the objects which they recall, and their termination; but, above all, by a consideration of the great design which an ascent upon them was intended to accomplish. The steps of this winding staircase commenced, we are informed, at the porch of the Temple-that is to say, at its very entrance. But nothing is more undoubted in the science of Masonic symbolism than that the Temple was the representative of the world, purified by the Shekinab, or the Divine Presence. The world of the pro - fane is without the Temple; the world of the initiated is within its sacred walls. Hence, to enter the Temple, to pass within the porch, to be made a Mason, and to be born into the world of Masonic light, are all synonymous and convertible terms. Here, then, the symbolism of the Winding Stairs begins. The Apprentice, having entered within the porch of the Temple, has begun his Masonic life. But the first de - gree in Masonry, like the lesser mysteries of the ancient systems of initiation, is only a preparation and purifica - tion for something higher. The Entered Apprentice is the child in Masonry.

As a Fellow Craft, he has advanced another step, and as the degree is emblematic of youth, so it Is here that the intellectual education of the candidate begins. And, therefore, here at the very spot which separates the Porch from the Sanctuary, where childhood ends and manhood begins, he finds stretching out before him a winding stair which invites him, as it were, to ascend, and which, as the symbol of discipline and instruction, teaches him that here must commence his Masonic labor—here he must enter upon those glorious, though difficult re - ~.earches, the end of which is to be the possession of divine truth. The Winding Stairs begin after the candidate has passed within the Porch and between the pillars of Strength and Establishment, as a significant symbol to teach him that as soon as he has passed beyond the years of irrational childhood, and commenced his entrance upon manly life, the laborious task of self-improvement is the first duty that is placed before him. He can not stand still, if he would be worthy of his vocation; his destiny as an immortal being requires him to ascend, step by step, until he has reached the summit, where the treas - ures of knowledge await him. The candidate, then, in the second degree of N asonry. represents a man starting forth on the journey of life, with the great task before him of self-improvement. For the faithful performance of this task, a reward is prom - ised, which reward consists in the development of all his intellectual faculties, the moral and spiritual elevation of his character, and the acquisition of truth and knowl - edge. Now, the attainment of this moral and intellec - tual condition supposes an elevation of character, an ascent from a lower to a higher life, and a passage of toil and difficulty, through rudimentary instruction, to the full fruition of wisdom. That is, therefore, beauti - fully symbolized by the Winding Stairs, at whose foot the aspirant stands ready to climb the toilsome steep, while at its top is placed “that hieroglyphic bright, which none but Craftsmen ever saw,” as the emblem of divine truth. And hence a distinguished writer has said that “these steps, like all the Masonic symbols, are illustrative of discipline and doctrine, as well as of natural, mathe - matical, and metaphysical science, and open to us an extensirz range of moral and speculative inquiry.” The candidate, incited by the love of virtue and the desire of knowledge, and withal eager for the reward of truth which is set before him, begins at once the toil - some ascent. At each division he pauses to gather Instruction from the symbolism which these divisions present to his attention. At the first pause which he makes, h” Is Instructed In the peculiar organization of the Order of which he has become a disciple. But the information here given, if taken in its naked, literal sense, is barren, and unworthy of his labor. The rank of the officers who govern, and the names of the degrees which constitute the Institution, can give him no knowledge which he has not before possessed. We must look, therefore, to the symbolic meaning of these allusions for any value which may be attached to this part of the ceremony. The reference to ihe organization of the Masonic insti - tution is intended to remind the aspirant of the union of men in society and the development of the social state out of the state of nature. He is thus reminded, in the very outset of his journey, of the blessings which arise from civilization, and of the fruits of virtue and knowl - edge which are derived from that condition. Masonry itself is the result of civilization; while in grateful return it has been one of the most important means of extend• ing that condition of mankind."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"I — — w.stichtingar~uu.Th1 w. stichtingargwi. iii w.stichtingargu~i.

All the monuments of antiquity that the ravages of time have left, combine to prove that man had no sooner emerged from the savage into the social state, Ihan he commenced the organization of religious mysteries, and the separation, by a sort of divine instinct, of the sacred from the profane. Then came the invention of archi - tecture as a means of providing convenient dwellings and necessary shelter from the inclemencies and vicissitudes of the seasons, with all the mechanical arts connected with it, and lastly, geometry, as a necessary science to enable the cultIvators of land to measure and desiguate the limits of their possessions. All these are clamiiied as peculiar characteristics of Speculalive Masonry, which may be considered as the type of civilization, the former bearing Ihe same relation to the profane world as the latter does to the savage state. Hence, we at once see the fitness of the symbolism which commences the aspirant’s upward progress in the cultivation of knowl - edge and the search after truth, by recalling to his mind the condition of civilization and the social unIon of nian - kind, as necessary preparations for the attainment of these objects. In the allusions to the o~&ers of a Lodge, and the degi.ees of Masonry as explanatory of the organ - ization of our own society, we clothe in our symbolic language the history of the organization of society. Advancing in his progress, the candidate is invited to contemplate another series of instructions. The Human Senses, as the appropriate channels through which we receive all our ideas of perception, and which, therefore, constitute the most important sources of our knowledge, are here referred to as symbol of intellectual cultiva - tion. Architecture, as the most important of the arts which conduce to the comfort of mankind, is also alluded to here, not simply because it Is so closely eonnected with the operative Institution of Masonry, but also as the type of all the other useful arts. In the second pause, Fzu.ow CaAFT’5 DEGREE. 187 in the ascent of the Winding StaIrs, the aspirant is, therefore, reminded of the necessity of cultivating prac - tical knowledge. So far, then, the Instructions he has received relate to his own condition in society, as a member of the great social compact, and to his means of becomIng, by a knowl - edge of the arts of practical life, a necessary and useful member of that society. But his motto will be, “Onward and forward I” The stair is still before him; Its summit Is not yet reached, and still further treasures of wisdom are to be sought for, or the reward will not be gained, nor the meddle ohamber, the abiding place of truth, be reached. In his third pause he, therefore, arrives at that poInt in which the whole circle of human science Is to be ex - plained. Symbols are in themselves arbitrary and of conventional signification, and the complete circle of human science might have been as well symbolized by any other sign or series of doctrines as by the seven liberal Arts and Sciences. But Masonry is an institution of the olden tinie; and this selection of the liberal arts and sciences as a symbol of the completion of human learning is one of the most pregnant evidences that we have of its antiquity. In the seventh century, and for a long time after - wards, the circle of instruction to which all the learning of the most eminent schools and most distinguished philosophers was confined, was limited to what was then called the liberal arts and sciences, and consisted of two branches, the trivi,am and the quadrirn’ism. The trivium *The words themselves are purely ciassical, but the meanings here given to them are of s medl~val or eon~upt Latlnity. Among the old Roinans. a trivium meant a place where three ways met, and a qewdrmanusa, where four. oi what we now call a cross-road.

These seven heads were supposed to include universal knowledge. He who was master of these was thought to have no need of a preceptor to explain any books or to solve any questions which lay within the compass of human reason; the knowledge of the trivium having fur - nished him with the key to all language, and that of the quadrivium having opened to him the secret laws of Nature. At a period when few were instructed In the trivium, and very few studied the quadrivium, to be master of both was sufficient to complete the character of a philosopher. The propriety, therefore, of adopting the seven liberal Arts and Sciences as a symbol of the com - pletion of human learning is apparent. The candidate, having reached this point, is now supposed to have accom - pushed the task upon which he had entered—he has reached the last step, and is now ready to receive the fuD fruition of human learning. So far, then, we are able to comprehend the true symbolisiii of the Winding Stairs. They represent the progress of an Inquiring mind with the toils and labors of intellectual cultivation and study, and the preparatory acquisition of all human science, as a preliminary step to the attainment of divine truth, which it must be remem - bered is always symbolized in Masonry by the Woan. Here we may allude to the symbolism of numbers, which is for the first time presented to the consideration of the Masonic student, in the legend of the Winding Stairs. The theory of numbers as the symbols of certain qualities was originally borrowed by the Masons from the school of PYTHAOORAS. According to that system, the fact that the total number of the steps amount in all to Iliteess, is a significant symbol. For $Itees was a FELLOW CRAFT’s DEGREE. 189 sacred number among the Orientals, because the letters of the holy name, JAH, were, in their numerical value, equivalent to fifteen; and hence a figure, which the nine digits were so disposed as to make fifteen either way when added together perpendicularly, horizontally, or diagonally, constituted one of these most sacred talis - mans. The fifteen steps in the Winding Stairs are, there - fore, symbolic of the name of God. But we are not yet done. It will be remembered that a reward was promised for all this toilsome ascent of the Winding Stairs. Now, what are the wages of a Specula - tive Mason? Not money, nor wine, nor oil. All these are but symbols. His wages are truth, or that approxi - mation to it which will be most appropriate to the degree into which he has been initiated. It is one of the most beautiful, but at the same time most abstruse, doctrines ef the science of Masonic symbolism, that the Mason is ever to be in search of truth, but is never to find it. And this is intended to teach the humiliating but necessary lesson, thai the knowledge of the nature of God and of man s relation to him, which knowledge constitutes divine truth, can never be acquired in this life. It is only when the portals of the grave open to us, and give us an entrance into a more perfect life, that this knowledge is to be attained. The Middle Chamber is, therefore, symbolic of this life, where only the symbol of the word can be given, where only the truth is to be reached by approximation, and yet where we are to learn that that truth will consist in a perfect knowledge of the G. A 0. T. U. This is the reward of the inquiring Mason; in this consists the wages of a Fellow Craft; he is directed to the truth, but must travel farther and ascend still higher to attain it. It is, then, as a symbol, and a symbol only, that we study this beautiful legend of the Winding Stairs. If we attempt to adopt it as a historical fact, the absurdity"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"w stlchtingar~us~ w.stichtingargut.,l¶1 w. stichtingargus. lii w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.n[ w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus. lii w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus ,n I w.stichti ngargu~. iil w.stichtingargi i~n I w.stichti ngal’gIlflJd \\v.StiChtil~~llV~I IN iii ~v.stich tin ~3il i’~~ijr~, iii ~V.StiCIltiIipJti ~ 1 UlN iii I 140 MANUAL OP THE LanGE. of its details stares us in the face, and wise men will wonder at our credulity. Its Inventors had no desire thus to impose upon our folly; but offering it to us as a great philosophical myth, they did not for a moment suppose that we would pass over its sublime moral teach - ings to accept the allegory as a hisiorical narrative, with - out meaning, and wholly irreconcilable with the records of Scripture, and opposed by all the principles of proba - bility. To suppose that eighty thousand craftsmen were weekly paid in the narrow precincts of the Temple cham - bers, is sirn~ily to suppose an absurdity. But to believe that all this pictorial representation of an ascent by a Winding Staircase to the place where the wages of labor were to be received, was an allegory to teach us the ascent of the mind from ignorance, through all the toils of study and the difficulties of obtaining knowledge, receiving here a little and there a little, adding something to the stock of our ideas at each step, until, in the mid - dle chamber of life-In the full fruition of manhood— the reward is attained, and the purified and elevated Intellect is invested with the reward, in the direction how to seek God and God’s truth—to believe this, Is to be - lieve and to know the true design of Speculative Masonry, the only design which makes it worthy of a good or a wise man’s study. Its historical details are barren, but Its symbols and allegories are fertile with instruction. And so we close with this lesson: The Fellow Craft represents a man laboring in the pursuit of truth; and the Winding kitairs are the devious pathways of that pursuit. MA5TEa MAsoN’s DEGREE. 141 i~ 4;. ~ - MASTER MASON’S DEGREE SYMBOLISM OF THE DEGREE. If the first degree is intended as a representation of youth, and the second of manhood, the third, or MASTER MAsON, is emblematic of old age, with Its trials, its sufferings, and its final termination in death. The time for toiling is now over; the opportunity to learn has passed away; the spiritual temple that we all have been striving to erect in our hearts is now nearly completed, and the wearied workman awaits only the word of the Grand Master of the Universe, to call him from the labors of the earth to the eternal refreshments of heaven. Hence, this Is by far the most solemn and Impressive of the degrees of Masonry; and It has, in consequence of the profound truths which It inculcates, been distin - guished by the craft as the sublime degree. As an En - tered Apprentice, the Mason was taught those elementary instructions which were to fit him for further advance - ment in his profession, just as the youth is supplied with that rudimentary education which is to prepare him for entering on the active doties of life; as a Fellow Craft, the Mason is directed to continue his investigations in the science of the Institution, and to labor diligently In the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"w. stlchtlngargLlIi w.stichtingargLu’t. iii w.stichtingargus. iii w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.

This is still the great design of the third degree of Ma - sonry. This is the scope and aim of its ritual. The Master Mason represents man, when youth, manhood, old age, and life itself have passed away as fleeting shadows, yet raised from the grave of iniquity, and quickened into another and better existence. By its legend and all Its ritual, it is implied that we have been redeemed from the death of sin and the sepulchre of pollution. “The ceremonies and the lecture,” as a dis - tinguished writer has observed, “beautifully illustrate this all-engrossing subject, and the conclusion we arrive at Is, that youth, properly directed, leads the life of man, regu - lated by morality, faith, and justice, will he rewarded at its closing hour by the prospect of eternal bliss.” THIRD LECTURE. This has very properly been called the sublime degree of a Master Mason, as well for the solemnity of the cere - monies which accompany it, as for the profound lessons of wisdom which it inculcates. The important design of the degree is to symbolize the great doctrines of the resurrection of the body and the immortality of the soul; and hence it has been remarked by a learned writer of MASTER MASON’S DEGREE 143 our Order, that the Master Mason represents a man saved from the grave of iniquity, and raised to the faith of salvation. The lecture is divided into three sections. FIsaT Szc’rxoN. The ceremony of raising a candidate to the sublime degree of a Master Mason is particularly described in the first section, which, though brief, will be found essentially usef iii.

Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.—Ecclessastes XII, 1-7. The passage of Scripture here selected is a beautiful and affecting description of the body of man suffering under the infirmities of old age, and metaphorically com - pared to a worn-out house about to fall into decay. How appropriate is such an introduction to the sublime and awful ceremonies of that degree, in which death, the res• urrection, and life eternal are the lessons to be taught by all its symbols and allegories’ The Working Tools of a Master Mason are all the imple - ments of Masonry indisenminately, but more especially the Trowel The Trowel is an instrument made use of by Opera - tive Masons, to spread the cement which unites a build - ing into one common mass; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of spreading the cement of brotherly love and affection, that cement which unites us into one sacred band, or society of friends and brothers, among whom no contention should ever exist, but that noble contention, or rather emulation, of who can best work and best agree. The three precious jewels of a Master Mason are here referred to MAs1~a MAsoN’s DEGREE. 145 THiRD DECREE WORKING TOOLS (Optional) As an Entered Apprentice, you were presented with the twenty four-inch gauges and the common gavel and instruct - ed in their use. These Working Tools were not given to ~ou as a mere part of the ritual to be memorized and then forgotten as you pass on to the next degree. Have you given eight hours to the service of God or a distressed worthy brother? Have you given one hour or even five minutes? Have you taken one minute to bring relief to some suffering brother or to console someone in sorrow? Have you stooped to wipe the tears from the eyes of a little child crying over some trifle, which to its tender imagination seems the greatest disaster? Have you tried to bring cheer to a fellow creature, realizing that not only those here in the Lodge but all men are your brothers? Have you taken the symbolic gavel and endeavored to divest yourself of some bad habit or undesirable trait to make yourself a better man in the eyes of your Maker? Have you tried to suppress yourself of some bad habit or undesirable thought which is all too apparent to the Grand Architect of the Universe who hath decreed that as a man thinketh so is he? Are you walking uprightly by the Plumb of rectitude, not in haughtiness and vainglos-y but with all humility and mod - esty? Have you acted on the square with all men because as a Mason it is expected of you? Are you really traveling upon that level of time to thai undiscovered country from which no traxeler returns? Time is a river of passing events and swift is its current. No sooner than one thing comes into view, than another will take its place and it too will be swept away. Time is neither the past nor the future, for the past has ceased to exist for us and the future may never be. The only time we have is now and now is forever. Seems it strange you should lixe forever, seems it strange you should live at all? Remember, my Brother, that an act once done or a word once spoken, the effect will go on forever, and the conse - quence whether for good or for evil are forever charged for or against you and you alone.

The legend of the third degree has been considered of so much importance that it has been preserved in the symbolism of every Masonic rite. No matter what modifi - cations or alterations the general system may have under - gone—no matter how much the ingenuity 0? the imagina - tion of the founders of rites may have perverted or cor - rupted other syrsibols, abolishing the old, and substituting new ones—the legend of the Temple Builder has ever been left untouched, to present itself in all the Integrity of Its ancient mythical form. The idea of the legend was undoubtedly borrowed from the Ancient Mysteries, where the lesson was the same as that now conveyed in the third degree of Masonry. Viewed in this light, it is evident that it Is not essential to the value of the symbolism that the legend should be proved to be historical. Whether considered as a truth - fssl narrative of an event that actually transpired during the building of the Temple, or simply as a myth, embody - ing the utteranie of a religious sentiment, the synibollc lesson of life and death and immortality is still contained in its teachings, and commands our earnest attention. Again is the lesson taught here, as It was In the first degree, that a Mason should enter upon no great and Important labor without first invoking the blessing of Deity. But the symbolism here is still further extended, and the candidate, representing one who is about to enter upon the pilgrimage of life, and all Its dangers and MASTER MAsoie’s DEGREE. 147 temptations, first is supposed to lay down upon his tres - tie-board the designs of labor, of honest ambition, or of virtuous pleasure upon which he is about to enter, and then to invoke the protection and blessing of the Grand Architect of the Universe upon his future career. For the Temple Builder is in the Masonic system, the symbol of humanity developed here and in the life to come; and as the Temple is the visible symbol of the world, its architect becomes the mythical symbol of man, the dweller and worker in the world, and his progress by the gates is the allegory of man’s pilgrimage through youth, manhood, and old age to the final triumph of death and the grave. The number 12 was celebrated as a mythical number In the ancient systems of sun-worship of which it has already been said that Masonry is a philosophical develop~ ment. The number there referred to the twelve signs of the Eodiac and in those Masonic rites in which the Builder is made the symbol of the sun, the twelve Fellow Crafts refer to the twelve signs in which alone the sun Is to be sought for.

The number thirteen Indicated the commencement of a new course of life, and thence It became the emblem of death. The number has always been considered as a sacred number; witness the 12 great gods of the Greeks and Romans; the 12 altars of Janus, referring to the 12 months of the year, the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 Apostles, and a hundred other Instances that, if necessary, might be cited. A WAYFARING MAsr.—The word means a traveler, one who passes over the road—derived from way or road, and the word fare, in its old meaning of to pass or go over. BAILEY defines a wayfaring man as “one who is accus - tomed to travel over the roads.” It is with this meaning frequently found in Scripture, as in Judges XIX, 17: “And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfar - ing man in the street of the city.” Such a man having perhaps just landed at Joppa, and on his way to the interior, would he most likely to be met near that city. and would be best enabled to give any Information wanted as to the condition of the shipping in the harbor, or in relation to any other matter connected with a passage. MASTER MAsoN’s DEGREE. 149 The word “sea-faring man,” sometimes ignorantly used In this place, is a monstrous corruption of the old term. Joppa, which was by the Hebrews called Japho, and is now known as Jaffa, was and is a seaport town and harbor on the coast of Palestine, about forty miles in “a westerly direction” (being about northwest) from Jerusalem. At the time of the building of the Temple It was the only seaport possessed by the Israelites, and was, therefore, the point through which all passage out of or into the country was effected. The emaIl hill near Mount Moriah can be clearly iden - tified by the most convincing analogies as being no other than Mount Calvary. Thus Mount Calvary was a small hill; it was situated in a westerly direction from the Tem - ple, and near Mount Moriah; It was on the direct road from Jerusalem to Joppa, and is thus the very spot wiser. a weary brother, traveling on the road, would find It convenient to sit down to test and refresh himself; it was outside the gate of the Temple; and lastly, there are several caves, or clefts its the rocks, In the neighbor - hood, one of which, it will be remembered, was, subse - quently to the time of this tradition, used as the sepulchre of our Lord.

The Sprig of A cacia is an important symbol in Free Masonry. The plant is known to botanists as the acacta Vera of TOURNEFORT and the mimosa nilofica of LINIeAEUS. It is an evergreen that grows in great abundance in the vicinity of Jerusalem. Its name in Hebrew is Shittah, or in the plural, Shittim, and it was always esteemed as a sacred tree by the lsraelites. The tabernacle and Its fur - niture, with the Ark of the Covenant, was made out of it, and it was consecrated, from among the other trees of the forest, to sacred purposes. As a symhol, It received, among the ancients, three interpretations. 1. In consequence of its incorruptible and evergreen nature, it was readily adopted as a symbol of the IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL. 2. In allusion to the derivation of its natne, among the Greeks, from a word which signifies freedom from sin, it was also adopted as a symbol of INFOcENcE. 8. Like all the other sacred plants, such as the myrtle, the mistletoe, and the lotus, which were used in the Ancient Mysteries, it became a symbol of INmATION. The three Interpretations com - bined teach us, by the use of this one symbol, that in the initiation of life and death, of which the initiation in the third degree is simply emblematic, innocence must for a time lie in the grave—at length, however, to be called by the Grand Master of all things to immortality. CLEFI5 IN THE RocKs.—The vicinity of Jerusalem is exceeding rocky and mountainous. These rocks abound in clefts or caves, which were sometimes used by the Inhabitants as places of seputture, sometimes as places of refuge In time of war, and sometimes as lurking places for robbers, or for persons guilty of crime and fleeing from justice.

The finding of this jewel alone gives some probability to this part of the legend. It Is hardly necessary to say that the letter G, wherever spoken of in Masonry as a symbol, Is merely a modern substitution for the Hebrew letter yod,~, which was the Initial of Jehonah, the tetragammaton, and, therefore, constantly used as a symbol of Deity.

The strictness of the religious code against pollution would, however, forbid that even these should be interred in the neighborhood of a temple or sanctuary. MASTER M asos ‘s DEOILEE. As far back as the era of Abraham, sepulchral monu - ments are mentioned. When RACHEL died, we are told that JAcoB “set a pillar upon her grave.” The ancient Arabians erected a heap of stones over the dead; but as among the Hebrews such a heap was an indication that the body beneath had been stoned to death, the latter nation, therefore, confined their monuments to a single stone, which it was carefully to hew and to orna - ment witb inscriptions. Although among the early Jews the burning of the body was esteemed disgraceful, the sentiment of the people was subsequently changed, and to burn the body with aromatic spices and deposit fhe ashes isv ass Ursa, was considered, in the days of King Solomon, as a distin - guished honor.

The Temple of King Solomon occupied seven years in its construction, during which time we are informed that it rained not in the daytime, that the workmen might not be obstructed in their labor. This famous fabric was supported by fourteen hun - dred and fifly-three columns, and two thousand nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. It was symbolically supported, also, by three principal columns, Wisdom, Sfrengfh, and Beauty, which were represented by the three Grand Masters. *** There were employed in its building three Grand Mas - ters; three thousand three hundred Overseers, or mas - ters of the work; eighty thousand Fellow Crafts; and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices.

This title is derived from three Hebrew words, ahim, brothers, snanah, to appoint or select, and ratzon, the will or law; and it consequently literally sIgnifies “the law of appointed or selected brothers.” It contains the rules and regulations of the Order, the details of all the public ceremonies to be used on various occasions, such as con - secrations, installations, funerals, etc., and is, in fact, a summary of all the fundamental principles of Free Masonry. To this book reference is made In all cases where the by-laws of the Grand Lodge are silent or not sufliciently explicit. In all public processions, the Ahiman Rezon, or Book of Constitutions, should be car - ried before the Grand Master by the Master of the oldest Lodge present. The word Lonna signifies a congregatIon of Free Ma - sons, as well as the room in which their meetings are held. But technically, the Lodge Is a small box or chest representing the Ark of the Covenant constructed by Bezaleel, according to the plan prescribed by God, and which was a model for the future Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation.

But the local customs and modern laws of the Order are not its landmarks, and may be amended or repealed from time to time by the authority of Grand Lodges. In the early ages of the world, it was the custom to mark the boundaries of landed property by stones or posts instead of fences. The removal of these produced confusion, disputes. and injury, and was criminal in the sight of God. Thus we read the injunction in the book of Deuteronomy (XIX, 14): “Thou shalt not remove the landmarks, which they of old have set in thine inheri - tance;” and our Grand Master, SOLOMON, has said, “Re - move not the ancieni landmarks which thy fathers have set.” Hence, our peculiar marks of distinction are called landmarks, as they designate our Inheritance among the craft, and prove our right to participate in the privileges they enjoy. The criminality of removing the landmarks of old may be inferred from the penalty annexed to the act: “Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor’s land - mark: and all the people shall say, Aman.”—Deut. XXVII, 17. The consequences resulting from a similar crime in Masonry need not be repeated to the brother - hood. Having hitherto been preserved in safety, they will, there is no reason to doubt, remain secure to the end of time. The TRnsTsz-Bo~uw, TRAcING-BOARD, FLOORING OR CAR- pE’r, Is a paInting which contains a delineation of the emblems of the various degrees and is a necessary ap~ pendage to a thorough understanding of the Masonic lectures. Formerly it was the custom to draw a plan of these emblems in chalk and charcoal on the floor of the Lodge, which was afterward obliterated when the work was finished. Hence, the Trestle-Board ta also some - times called the Flooring. r AHIHAN REEON. A Grand Lodge is styled “Most Worshipful,” and the title of the Grand Lodge of South Carolina is, “THE MOST WOasHIPrus.

The decorations of the Subordinate Lodges are light blue and silver The collar should be made in the form of a triangle, meeting in a point at the breast. The apron must be of pure lambskin. CHAPTER II. Of the Temper and Qualities Required in Those Who Wish to Become Free Masons. Before we describe the duties of a Free Mason, In the various offices and stations to which he may be called in the Lodge, it Is proper to give some account of the temper and qualities which are absolutely requisite in all who desire to participate in the honors and advantages of those who are initiated into the mysteries and Instructed in the art of ancient Free Masonry. As the Bible is the first Great Light presented to a candidate, the following quotatIons from that Inspired book are recommended to his previous perusal: “Lord, who shall ahide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell In thy holy hill?"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"AHn~sAN RERON. 166 w. stichtingarguN .l¶It w.stichtingargus. iii w. stichtingargu s.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus ni w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus. iii w. stichtingargus. lii w. stichtingargui~.nt w . stiebti n garguN 0 t~t w. stichtingargw~,nt vv.stichti I’43111 ~ hi ~v.Stichtl 11811181 l~, iii xv.stich t I l1{)tl I 81it4 iii I I “He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteous - ness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. “He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. “In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. “He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent.”—Psakn XV. “Who shall ascend into the hills of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.” —Psalm XXl V, 3, 4. “What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? “Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speak - Ing guile. “Depart from evil and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.”—Psalsn XXXIV, 12-14. Then let the candidate prepare himself to say: “I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will l~eep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.”—Pralm XXXIX, 1. “I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I com - pass thine altar, 0 Lord.”—Psalm XXVI, 6. SECTION 1. CONCmNINO Gon AND RELIGION. Whoever, from a love of knowledge, the desire of an enlarged sphere of usefulness, or from any other vir. tuous motive, is desirous of becoming a Free Mason, must be informed that he is required to believe firmly in the existence of Deity, and to worship and obey him, as the AHIMAN REEON. great Arcnitect and Governor of the Universe. Free Masons are strictly enjoined to observe the moral law; and to shun the paths of immorality and vice. They are equally to avoid the gross errors of the Free-thinker, of bigotry, and superstition. They are to make a proper use of theIr own reason, “according to that liherty where - with” as Mason “is made free;” “so using it, as not to abuse it.” They are charged to adhere to those grand essentials of revealed religion In which all men agree, while the modes and forms of worship are left to their own judgment. Whence it follows, that Free Masons are to be good men and true; men of honor, honesty, and virtue, by whatever name they may be distinguished. From this account of the religion of the craft, it must not be supposed that Masonry teaches men to become indifferent to the concerns of religion and the future state. The reverse of this is true. Free Masonry recom - mends and teaches religion and morality, as essential to its own prosperity and the happiness of its members. It endeavors, in all its rites, to Impress these important duties deeply on the minds of the fraternity. It labors to make them pious and virtuous here, that they may be happy hereafter. An Atheist can not be admitted, be - cause he could not be bound by a religious obligation. Immoral men are rejected by our regulations, because they live in defiance of the laws and commands of God; and neither individuals, nor societies composed of such individuals, can be expected to promote the good of their fellow creatures, nor to bring down a blessing from heaven upon any of their concerns. Free Masonry, how - ever, makes no inquiry as to the particular religious denomination to which Its members belong. This Is a matter whIch it wisely leaves between them and their God. “To their own master they stand or fall.” Universal benevolence is the greatest of all moral attaInments. It is the polar star of Masonry.

Religious disputes, therefore, and not religion, are banished from the Lodge. Every Free Mason Is required to worship God in the manner and form which he conscientiously helieves to be most acceptable in His sight, and most conformable to His word. In short, the Mason’s moral and religlouu duties are comprised In this command: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor aa thpself. SECTION II. Oi’ VHS CIvIL MAoIsmATE. A Free Mason must be a peaceable citizen, or subject to the civil powers wherever he resides or works. He must not be concerned in plots or conspiracies against the peace and welfare of the State or Nation. He must neither rebel against the laws of the government, nor behave disrespectfully to magistrates. As Free Masonry has always been Injured by war, bloodshed, and confu - sion, so ancient kings, princes, and rulers of great and powerful nations have protected and encouraged the craft because of their peaceable and loyal behavior. This prac - tically answered the cavils of their adversaries, and pro - moted the honor of the fraternity. If a brother be a rebel against the State, he must not be countenanced In his rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man. He forfeits all the benefits of the Lodge and his fellows must refuse to associate or converse with him in private while he continues In his crimes, that no offense may be given to lawful government. But such person is still to be considered as a Free Mason, his character, as such, being indelible; and we must entertain the hope that the rules of the craft may again influence his conduct, and reclaim him to the paths of rectitude and honor. r AmMAN REZON. 169 SECTION III. Co1qcERNING PSIVATE QUALITIRS AND DirrIEs Whoever would be a real Free Mason and live con - formably with the precepts of the Order, should learn to control his passions. and to lead a virtuous life. He must endeavor to avoid all kinds of intemperance and excess, as tending to lessen his respectability and useful - ness In the community, and to reflect dishonor on the fraternity. He must be Industrious In hIs profession or trade, that he may eat no man’s bread for naught. He must employ his leisure hours In innocent recreation, for the promotion of health, and devote some portion of them to the Word of God, and the arts and sciences, that he may be the better enabled to perform his duty to his Creator and Benefactor, his country, his neighbor, and himself. The Scriptures, no less the guide of our actions than the rule of our faith, have the following Illustration of our duty: “A laboring man that Is given to drunkenness, shall not be rich; and he that contemneth small things shall fall by little and little. Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away; and he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent. Moths and worma shall have him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken away. He that is hasty to give credit (to idle tales) is light-minded; and he that sinneth shall offend agaInst his own souL Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned; but he that resisteth pleasure, crowneth life. He that can rule his tongue shall live without strife; and he that hateth babbling, shall have less evil. Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. Whether it be to a friend or foe, talk not of other men’s lives; and if thou canst without offense, reveal them not. For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"r w. stichtingargLt~ .l¶I w.stichtingargu~. iii w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus .nI w.stiChtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargu s.n I w.stiChtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s .nl w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichti ngargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargu~i,n I w.stichtingargtIN,n I w.stichtingargu~~nI w.stichtin8oi 811 witl ~v.stichti Ilt:PiII t3~N iii vv.sticht I fl~ll I 8Il~4 III vv.stichtin~uit piiu iii I 170 I AHIHAN REZON. thee. If thou hast heard a word, let It die with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee. A fool travaileth with a word as a woman in labor of a child. Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it; and if he have done it, that he do It no more. Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it; and if he have, that he speak It not again. Admonish a friend; for many times It is a slander, and believe not every tale. There Is one that slippelh in his speech, but not from his heart; and who Is he that hath not offended with his tongue? AdmonIsh thy neighbor before thou threaten him; and not being angry, give place to the law of the Most High. The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doc - trine of life; and they that do thIngs that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of Immortality.”— Ecclesiastfrus (Apocrypha) XIX, 1-20. For the better attainment of the necessary qualifica - tions, the Free Mason must seek and acquire, as far as possible, the virtues of patience, meekness, self-denial, forbearance, and the like. These will give him the com - mand over himself, and enable him to govern his own family with atfeclion, dignity, and prudence; while, at the same time, they will check every disposition injurious to the world, and promote that love and decorum which brethren of the same Lodge or household owe to each other. Therefore, to afford succor to the disiressed, to divide our hread with the industrious poor, and to put the misguided traveler into the way, are the indispensa - ble duties of the craft. But though a Free Mason is never to shut his ear unkindly to the complaints of any of the human species, yet when a brother is oppressed or suffers, he is, in a more peculiar manner, called upon to open his whole soul in love and compassion to him, and to relieve him, wilhout prejudice to his own family, ac - cording to his ability. AHIMAN REEON. 171 It is further necessary that all who would be true Free Masons, should learn to abstain from all malice and slander, evil-speaking, backbiting, unmannerly, scorn - ful, provoking, reproachful, ungodly, and profane lan - guage; and that he should know how to obey those who are set over him, on account of their superior qualifica - tions as Free Masons, however inferior they may be in worldly rank or fortune. For although Free Masonry divests no man of his temporal honors, but, on the con - trary, highly respects them, yet in the Lodge, pre-emi - nence of virtue, and knowledge in the mystic art, are con - sidered as the true and only fountains of all honor, rule, and government. The last quality which we shall mention, as absolutely requisite in those who would be Free Masons, Is that of SECRECY; which, indeed, from its importance, ought to have held the first place, If it had not been intended to treat of it more fully, as a conclusion to the whole. So much importance is attached to this particular quality or virtue, among Free Masons, that it Is enforced under the strongest penalties and obligations. No man can be esteemed wise, who Is void of intellectual strength and ability sufficient to cover, and conceal, such honest secrets as are committed to him, as well as his own more serious affairs. Both sacred and profane history teach us, that many vIrtuous altempta have failed of their In - tended ohjects, through defect of secret concealment. The philosophers and wise men of antiquity were so fully persuaded of the great virtue of secrecy, that It was the first lesson which they taught their pupils and followers. In the school of PYTHAGORAS, It was a rule that every novitiate was to be silent for a time, and refrain from speaking, unless when a question was asked; that the valuable secrets which he had to communicate might be the better preserved and valued. And It Is recorded of CATO, the Roman Censor, that he told his"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"r w stichtrngarMuu~ w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichti ngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu~, ni w.stichtingarguN, n I w.stichtingargu~.u I w.stichti fl~3orgutblit ~v.stichtil1,l’ 8 t)r4 Ill ~v.stichtingar~Il~ iii ~v.sticht i iipjirgiir~ iii I 172 q AHIHAN REZON. friends there were three things of which he never failed to repent, viz: 1. To have gone by sea, wben he could have gone by land. 2. If he passed a day without en - deavoring to do good. 8. If he told a secret. Among the Persians, betraying a secret is punished by the public law. And HosacE, with whose writings every classical schoolhoy is familiar, declares it to be unsafe to live under the same roof or to sail in the same ship with a divulger of secrets.—Od. III, 2-25. Nor is the virtue of secrecp recommended only by the wisest heathen philosophers and lawgivers; but likewise by the fathers of the Church and by inspired writers and lawgivers. Sr. AMBRosE places the patient gift of silence among the principal foundations of virtue; and SOLOMON, the wise King of Israel, deems the man unworthy to reign, or have any rule over others, who can not command him - self and keep his own secrets. A betrayer of secrets he deems infamous, and a traitor; but him that conceals thesn he accounts a faithful brother. “A tale-bearer,” says he, ‘~revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.”—Pro. XI, 18. “He that goeth about as a tale-bearer, revealeth secrets; therefore, meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.”—Pro. XX, 19. “Discover not a secret to another, lest he that heareth it putteth thee to shame, and thine infamp turn not away.”—Pro. XXV, 9, 10. “Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from trouble.”— Pro. XXI, 28. To the same purpose, the son of Sirach has the following beautiful passages, which are worthy to be forever recorded in the heart of every Free Mason: “Whosoever discovereth secrets, loseth his credit, and shall never find a friend to his mind. Love thy friend and be faithful unto him; but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him: for as a man hath destroyed his enemy, so hast thou the love of thy neigh- .1 I AmMAN REEON. 178 bor. As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbor go, and shalt not get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare. As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling, there may be recon - cilement; but he that betrapeth secrets is without hope.” Ecclesiasticus (Apocrypha) XX VII, 10-22. Having now spoken of the internal qualities and vir - toes required in all who aspire to the honor and advan - tage of becoming Free Masons, we must next speak of the ewternal qualities, and the steps to be pursued in order to obtain initiation and admission into a regular Lodge, under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free Masons of South Carolina. No person can be initiated, or become a member of a Lodge, unless, in addition to the qualities and virtues mentioned above, or, at least, a disposition and capacity to seek and acquire them, he is twenty-one years of age, of good char - acter; of ssiff scent natural endowments, and with the senses of G MAN. He must likewise have an estate, office, trade, occupation, or some visible way of acquiring an honest live - lihood, and of working in his craft, as becomes the members of this ancient and honorable fraternity. Free Masons must not only earn what is svfficient for themselves and family, but likewise something to spare for works of charity, and for supporting the ancient grandeur and dignity of the mystic craft. Every person desirous of oxlmission must also be up - right in body, not deformed or dismembered, at t he time of making, but of hale and entire limbs, as a MAN ought to be."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"r w.stichtingar~ui~ w.stichtingargu~i.n I w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.n I w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichti ngargus. iii w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichti ngargus, iil w.stichtingargtitud w.stichti ,lgor8uwuI xv. stichti ngti ~ I~ ,ii I xv.stichtingtll’~~,ii~ iii xv.stichtingttr~iiti HI xv.stichtil~Utl’~uir~ ill I —-‘I 174 A F{IMAN REZON.

It is, unfortunately for the honor and prosperity of the craft, too much the custom to overlook the necessity of a strict inquiry into the moral character of the candidate; yet this inquiry is as much a duty, as the inviolate pres - ervation of the secrets of the Order. This examination must, therefore, not be a mere matter of form, but of actual inquiry. The character of a candidate must be the subject of serious Investigation, and not of mere recommendation. Every Free Mason who, knowingly, Is instrumental in Introducing a man of bad or doubtful character Into the Lodge, is a partaker of his guilt. It Is the duty of every member of the Lodge to inform the “Committee of Inquiry” of any circumstances within his knowledge which ought, in his opinion, to prevent the admission of a candidate into the society of virtuous men. He should likewise inform the Master and Wardens of such circumstances; and there should not be the least hesitation In exercising the right of rejection, according to the By-Laws of the Lodge. But, at the same time, whatever may be said or done on these occasions, must never transpire beyond the walls of the Lodge, except where the By-Laws, the rules and regulations of the Grand Lodge, or a vote of the Lodge, may otherwise direct CHAPTER III. Of the General Regulations Among Ancient Free Masons, Particularly Adapted to the Usages and Customs of the Craft in South Carolina. Having treated “of the temper and qualities required in those who wish to become Free Masons,” we now pro- crud to those general regulations which more immediately concern Free Masons, as members of Lodges. SE~CTION I. CoircRaNlsro A LODGE AND ITS GOVEUNNENT. 1. A Lodge is a place in which Free Masons meet to r AHIXAN REZON. 177 work. The assembly, or organized body of Free Masons, is also called a Lodge, just as the word Church is expres - sive of the congregation and of the place in which they meet to worship. There is also a part of the furniture which, in strict Masonic language, is called The Lodge, and which is placed in the center of the room, at the head of the trestle- board. 2. The qualities requisite in those who are to be admitted as members of a Lodge have been fully mentioned in the foregoing chapter. It is, therefore, only necessary to repeat here, in general, that they are to be men “under the tongue of good report,” of due and mature years, that is, twenty-one years of age, hale and sound, not deformed or dismembered at the time of their making, and no woman or eunuch; and that they have an estate, office, trade, occupation, or some visible mode of supporting themselves honestly and respectably. 8. A Lodge must assemble for work at least once in each calendar month. It must consist of one Master, two Wardens, senior and junior; one Treasurer and one Sec - retary, who are to be installed; two Deacons, senior and junior; two Stewards, and of as many members as the majority of the Lodge shall, from time to time, think proper to prescribe. More than fifty, when they can attend regularly, as the rules of the craft require, are generally found inconvenient for working to advantage. When, therefore, a Lodge comes to be thus numerous, some of the ablest master workmen, and others under their direction, may obtain leave to separate and to work by themselves, as the laws hereafter to be delivered will more particularly show. But no Warrant of Constitu - tion can be granted to any number of Free Masons, nor can a new Lodge be formed, unless there be among them three Master Masons, to be nominated and Installed officers, for governing and Instructing the brethren of *See Chapter 1."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"W stlChtlngal W stlchtlngargLl”4 w.stichtingargus.ii I w. stichtingargus.n I xv.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargusnl xv. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.n I xv. stichtingargus. n I xv.stichti ngargus. iii xv.stichtingargus. ni xv.stichtingargii~, iii xv. stichti ngarguN,nI xv.stichti ngargtM~.IiI xv. stichtin8o, Blif4,lll xv.stichti ngiii ~iiri~ iii xvstichti iigar 8U~4 111 xv.stichtlflplllf=uir4 iii I 178 AHIMAN REZON. such Lodge, and promoting them In due time according to their merit. It must likewise be satisfactorily shown to the Grand Lodge that the granting of a new Warrant of Constitution would promote the interests of the craft; for it Is better to have but a few Lodges, well attended, than to increase the number If they are not so. 4. Every Lodge has the right to keep Itself an entire body; therefore no number of brethren can withdraw or separate themselves from the Lodge in which they were made, or were afterward admitted members, unless such Lodge becomes too numerous for working; nor even then, unless they pay up all their dues to the Lodge, and give notice that they Intend to apply to the Grand Lodge for a Warrant of Constitution to form themselves Into a new Lodge. And no set of Free Masons, without such War - rant of Constitution, or a Dispensation, shall ever take upon themselves to work together, or form a Lodge. 5. In order that due decorum be observed while the Lodge is engaged In business, and for the better preserva - tion of secrecy and harmony, a brother, well skilled In the Master’s part, shall be appointed and paid for tiling the Lodge door during the time of communication. 6. Every Lodge shall keep a book containing its By - Laws; the names of its members; a list of all the Lodges under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge, and united In general communication, with the usual times and places of meeting of such Lodges. It shall likewise keep a book for recording the ordinary business of its communica - tions, and, generally, all such matters as may be com - mitted to writing. It shall likewise keep a book in which every visiting brother shall write hIs name and the name of the Lodge from which he hails. 7. No Lodge shall snake more than five new brethren at one time, unless by dispensation from the Grand Mas - ter, or Deputy, in his absence. Not more than one degree shall be given in one night to one person; nor shall any I AHIHAX REZON. r 179 person, except in a case of emergency, and under the dispensation of the Grand Master, be made or admitted a member of a Lodge, or a demitted memher be permitted to rejoin a Lodge, without being proposed one month be - fore. This is necessary, that all the members may have time to make the necessary Inquiries into the candidate’s or applicant’s character, that~there may be unanimity In the election and admission of members. No dispetwa-. tion can be given to suspend this unanimity, because unanimity is essential to the well-being of every Lodge, and its own memhers are the most competent judges In this matter. If It were allowed that any foreign, or even auperlor, jurisdiction might impose a fractious or dis - agreeahle member upon a Lodge, it might destroy its harmony, and would intrench upon Its liberty, to the great injury, if not the total dissolution, of such Lodge. 8. The officers of the Lodge shall be elected for twelve months, on the regular Lodge night next preceding the Festival of St John the Evangelist. 9. No Lodge shall Interfere In the business of another Lodge. It would be highly improper in any Lodge to confer a degree on a brother who is not of its household, except as a matter of courtesy; for every Lodge ought to be competent to manage its own business, and is the best judge of the qualifications of its own members. And it does not follow, as a matter of course, that a brother admitted among the household as an Apprentice, to learn the mystic art, is capable of taking charge of that household, however skilled he may be in his ap - prenticeship; for there are many very necessary quali - fications essential in those who are promoted to the higher ranks of the Order. 10.

No man must be permitted to remain in the Order after having been guilty of a breach of the laws of the land, or becoming an Immoral and debauched character. The Lodge should be composed of men of virtuous principles and conduct, and when the memhers cease to be so, they should be sus - pended or expelled, as the case may require. The first and great ohject with the craft Is, to preserve the frater - nity free from censure; and when the world perceives that virtue is encouraged and rewarded by Free Masons, and vice discountenanced and punished, It will add to their respectability and honor. It will be in vain to examine the private character of a candidate before ad - mission, if we are not equally jealous of it afterward. This Is consistent both with reason and religion. 12. All Masonic power being derived from the Grand Lodge, its rules and regulations must be strictly obeyed and supported. 18. No Lodge can suspend Its communications without a dispensation, except during the months of July. August and September. And any Lodge ceasing to meet for twelve months, shall be deemed extinct. 14. Every difficulty which occurs, which is neither pro - vided for by ihe rules and regulations of the Grand Lodge, nor hy this Ahiman ReEon, must be submitted to the Grand Lodge. SECTION II. CONcEENINO THE B RHAvIOR op FREE MAsoNs AR MExasna OP A Loma. 1.—Of Attendance. Every brother ought to belong to some regular Lodge where he resides, and should always appear therein prop - erly clothed, and in clean and decent apparel, suhjecting AmMAN REZON. 181 himself to all its By-Laws, and the general regulations. He must attend all the meetings of the Lodge, whether regular or extra, when duly summoned, unless he can offer to the Lodge such an excuse as the said laws and regulations admit. 11.—Of Working. Every Free Mason should work hard and honestly on working days, that he may live reputably and appear in a decent and becoming manner on holidays. The work - ing hours appointed by law, or confirmed by custom, are to be strictly ohserved under such penalties and fines as may be established. Free Lvlasons snould perform their duty without mur - muring or mutiny, nor leave the Lodge until the labor is finished. They must avoid all unhecoming modes of ex - pression, and call each other Brother, hoth within and without the Lodge. They must instruct the younger brethren to become hright and expert workmen. that the materials for the edifice may not be spoiled But they must be careful that they do not allow cowans to work with them, that their arts end mysteries may not be un - lawfully obtained. 111.—Of Behavior in the Lodge While Open. While the Lodge is open for work, no brother shall hold any private conversation, nor talk of anything foreign or impertinent to the work in hand; he shall not interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any brother address - ing himself to the chair nor act with levity while the Lodge is engaged in what Is serious and solemn; but every brother shall pay due reverence to the Master, the Wardens, and all his fellows. If he enters the Lodge after It is open, he must give the customary salutes to the proper officers.

Every brother found guilty of a fault, must ahide by the decision of the Lodge; but if he feels himself ag - grieved, he may appeal to the Grand Lodge. No private piques or quarrels, about nations, families, religion, or politics, must be brought within the doors of the Lodge, as being directly contrary to the rules of the Order already laid down. Free Masons, as such, are of the uni - versal acknowledged religion, and of all nations. They are, therefore, bound to live upon the square, level, and plumb with each other; to follow the steps of their predecessors, in cultivating the peace and harmony of the Lodge, without distinction of religious sect or political party IV.—Of Behavior After the Lodge is Closed and Before the Brethren Depart Horns. When the Lodge is closed, and the labors of the day are finh,hed, the brethren, before they depart home to their rest, may enjoy themselves with Innocent mirth, enlivened with their own peculiar songs and pieces of music. But they must treat one another according to the rules of politeness, avoiding all excess and compul - sion, both in eating and drinking; considering each other, in the hours both of labor and refreshment, as always free. Therefore, no brother is to be hindered from going home when he pleases; for although after Lodge hours Free Masons are as other men, yet If they should fall into excess, the blame, though unjustly, may be cast upon the fraternity, as a society, by the ignorant or the envious world. V.—Of Contributions, Dues, Etc. Every member must pay to the Lodge, at the appointed time, his suhscriptions, contributions, dues, etc., accord - ing to the By-Laws. If they stand in need of assistance, L r AHIMAu REZON. 188 it will be cheerfully given in the customary way. But no one should continue a member of any society without contributing to its support. The Lodge fees are small; and, if punctually paid, but very few will find them burdensome. SECTION HI. CONcEENINO THE BEHAVIOR OF FREE MAsoNs sir THEm PRIVATE CHARACTER. 1.—When a Number of Brethren Happen to Meet, With - out Any Strangers Among Them, and Not in a Formed Lodge. In this case, they are to salute each other In a courteous manner, as they are or may be instructed in the Lodge. They must call each other Brother; and freely communi - cate hints of knowledge. without disclosing secrets. They must take care in all their actions and conversations that they are neither overseen nor overheard by st rangers. In this friendly Intercourse no brother must presume to derogate from the respect due to another, were he not a Free Mason. For though all Free Masons, as brethren, are upon the level, yet Free Masonry, as was said before, divests no man of those honors to which he Is entitled in a clvii or literary capacity. On the contrary, It Increases our respect for him, and teaches us to add to all his other honors those which, as Free Mason, we cheerfully pay to an eminent brother, distinguishing him above all of his rank and station, and serving him readily according to our ability. 11.—When in the Presence of Strangers Who Are Not Free Masons. In the presence of persons who are not Free Masons, the meii,bers of the society must be cautious of their words and behavior, so that the most observant stranger"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"r w st1chtingal~uui xv.stichtingargu~.n1 w. stichtingargus. id w. stichtingargus.n I xv.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichti ngargus.nl xv. stichti ngargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.n I xv.stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingargu8, flI xv. stichti nga rgu~ ~nI xv.stichti ngargu~ 1 nI xv. stich tin git i’~t ~wli I xv.stichti ilgiii’gli~ iii I I 184 AHIHAN REZOR, shall not be able to discover what is not proper to be intimated. The impertinent and ensnaring questions, or ignorant and idle discourse, of those who seek to dis - cover the secrets and mysteries committed to Free Ma - sons, must be answered with caution and prudence, and the discourse wisely, but politely, diverted to another subject. 111.—When at Home and In the Neighborhood. Free Masons ought to be moral men, and fully quali - fied, as Is required in the foregoing sections. Conse - quently, they should be good husbands, good parenis, good sons, and good neighbors; not absenting themselves unnecessarily from hoi,ie; avoiding all excess injurious to theniseives or families. A Free Mason who behaves ill to his family, either personally In not providing for their wants hy honest industry, or who Idles away his time in dissipation and drunkenness, shall be accused be - fore his Lodge, and stand to Its award. The Lodge must be composed of virtuous and Industrious men, and not of drones, who would live upon the labor of others. Free Masons should, as much as possible, encourage each other in their business, preferring to employ the craft, rather than strangers, provided they can be accom - modated equally as well. IV.—Of Behavior Toward a Foreign Brother. or Strangers. Strangers and foreigners, who are Free Masons, are to be cautiously and scrupulously examined, that the craft may not be imposed upon by pretenders or cowans; and if an imposter should be discovered, he must be re - jected with scorn and contempt, and information be given to the Grand Lodge. Such as are found to be good men and true, are to be respected as brothers; they are 10 AHIae~&ir REZON. 185 be relieved, If in want, or be directed how to obtain relief; and to he recommended to employment, if an opportunity should offer. V.—Of Behavior Behind a Brother’s Back, as Well as Bef ore Hi,a Face. Free Masons have always been charged to avoid all manner of slandering and backbiting of any persons, but more especially of their brethren; to avoid all malice and unjust resentment, or talking disrespectfully of a brother’s person or performance. Nor must they suffer any others to spread unjust reproaches or calumnies against s brother, behind his back, nor to injure him in his fortune, occupation, or character. They shall defend such a brother, and give him notice of any danger or injury with which he may be threatened, to enahie him to escape the same, as far as is consistent with honor, pru - dence, and the safety of religion, morality, and the State, but no further. VI.—Concer~alng Dilerences and Lawsuit., If Anij Such Should UnhappIly Arise Among the Brethren. If a Drother do an injury to another, or If any differ - ence should arise about any private business, applica - tion must be made to the offender’s Lodge, to have the matter in dispute adjusted by the brethren. And if either party be not satisfied with the determination of the Lodge, an appeal may be carried to the Grand Lodge. But lawsuits are not to be instituted until the matter can not be decided by the brethren. And If it be a n~at - ter that wholly concerns Free Masonry, lawsuits are to be entirely avoided, and the advice of prudent brethren is to be followed, as they are the best judges of such differences. But when references are either impracticable or unsuc -"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"w. stichtingar~uu.flI w.stichtingargu~. ni w. stichtingargus. iii w. stichtingargus.n I xv.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI xv.stichtingargu s.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl xv. stichti ngargus.nl xv. stichti ngargus.nl xv.stichti ngargus.nI xv. stichti ngargus.nI xv. stichti ngargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nI xv.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.n I xv. stichti ngargus. ill xv.stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingargus. iii xv.stichtingargus, ol xv. stichtinga rguN,nI xv.stichtingai’gut~u1 xv. st ich t i ngi I i’~3I i~iiI xv.sti ch tin gii r~=~ilr4 lll I r 186 AHIMAN REZON. cessful, and courts of law and equity must at last decide, you must still follow the general rules of Free Masonry already laid down. You must avoid all wrath, malice, rancor, and personal ill will, in carrying cm the suit with a brother. You must neither say nor do anything to hin - der the continuance or renewal of that brotherly love and friendship which are the glory and cement of our ancient fraternity. In this way we shall show to the world the benign Influences of Free Masonry, as wise, true, and faithful brethren have done before us, and as all who shall fol - low us, and would be thought worthy of that name, will do, until Free Masonry shall be dissolved, with the great fabric of the world, in the last general conflagration I These charges, and such others as shall be given in a way that cannot be written, are to be strictly and con - scientiously observed. That no one may plead ignorance of them, they should be read or made known to the new brethren at their Initiation, and at such other times as the Master shall direct. SECTION IV. OF THE MASTEE OF THE LODGE, His Exzc’rxoN, Omcu, AND DUTE. No brother can be elected Master of a Lodge unless he has served in the office of Warden somewhere, of which he must produce satisfactory evidence; except in very extraordinary cases, as when a new Lodge is to be formed, or when no Past Master or former Warden is to be found among the members. In such cases, three Master Masons, although they have served in no former office, if they are well skilled in the art, may be con - stituted Master and Wardens of such new Lodge, or any old Lodge, in the like emergency. The Master of every Lodge shall not suffer a member AHIHAN REZON. 187 to vote on the night of election who has not paid up his fines and dues according to law. Every member has one vote, and the Master two, where the number of votes are equal, otherwise he has but one. When the hallot is closed he should call up to the chair two brethren, and in their presence shall carefully examine the poil, and declare him duly elected that has a majority of votes. The Master of every Lodge is particularly charged, as appertaining to his office, duty, and dignity, to see that the By-Laws of this Lodge, as well as the Constitution and the rules and regulations of the Grand Lodge, be duly oheerved and oheyed~ that his Wardens discharge their office faithfully, and be examples of diligence, vir - tue, and sobriety to the craft; that true and exact minutes and entries of all proceedings be made and kept by the Secretary; that the Treasurer shall keep and render exact and just accounts at the stated times, according to the By-Laws and orders of the Lodge; and, in general, that all the furniture, or other property, and money belonging to the Lodge, be truly managed and dispensed as if they were those of his own private house - hold, according to the vote and direction of the Lodge. The Master shall likewise take care that no Appren - tice or Fellow Craft he taken into his Lodge, unless he has sufficient employment for him, and finds him to be the son of honest, free parents, of full age (I. e., twenty- one years) and otherwise duly qualified, according to the rules before laid down, for learning and understand - ing the mysteries of the art. Thus shall the original intention of the founders of our society be carried Into effect, and the craft be held in repute. Thus, also, shall Apprentices, when expert in the business of their appren - ticeship, be admitted among the Fellow Crafts, and, in due time, be raised to the sublime degree of Master Ma - sons, capable of undertaking the management of a Lodge, with the prospect of passing through all the higher honors"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"w.stlchtrngar~u~ w.stichtingarguM,nt w. stichtingargus. id w. stichtingargus.n I xv. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nI xv.stichtingargus. n I xv.stichtingargus.n I xv. stichti ngargus. iii xv.stichti ngargus.nI xv.stichtingargu~,n! xv.stichtingargti~.i, iii xv.stichtingat’gllb 1 nl xv.stichti ngiii’gvitidil xv. stichti ngii r{~j ir~ ~ii I xv. stichti ngi I l’~3I i~,iiI xv.sticht I n~tt rf~Ub~i it xv.stichtiiigiir~ii~ iii I I r 188 AHIMAN REZON. of Free Masonry, viz., those of Wardens and Masters of their Lodges, and, perhaps, at length, of being Grand Wardens and Grand Masters, according to their merit. The Master of a Lodge is authorized to call a meeting of his Lodge at pleasure, upon the application of any of the brethren, and upon any emergency and occurrence which, in his judgment, may require their meeting. It is likewise his duty to attend all the communications of the Grand Lodge, in which the Master and Wardens, or either of them, have power and authority to represent their Lodge, and to transact all matters relative thereto, as well and as truly as if the whole body were there present; and to act upon every other matter that may be brought before the Grand Lodge. No Lodge can be removed from its usual place of meeting without the concurrence of a majority of its members. The motion for removal must be made at a regular communication, and be determined at the next regular communication thereafter; of which notice shall be given In the summons. But In cases of necessity, which, in the judgment of the Master, or, in his absence, of the presiding officer, admit of no delay, he may call an extra Lodge for the purpose of taking the same into consideration, and shall be governed in his conduct by the decision of the majority. But the Lodge cannot be moved out of the district assigned in the Warrant of such Lodge, without a dispensation from the presiding Grand Officer, and the sanction of the Grand Lodge obtained at its next communication thereafter. Every removal of a Lodge shall be Immediately notified by the Secretary of such Lodge, to the Grand Secretary. The Master has, particulariy. the charge of the Warrant of Constitution, which should always be in the Lodge when it Is opened. On the night of election, he has the privi - lege of appointing his Senior Deacon from among the Master Masons of his Lodge. He also appoints the Tiler. AHIMAN REZON. 189 If a Grand Officer, a Present or Past Master, visits the Lodge, the Master, or presiding officer, must pay him the honors which are due to his rank, whether he be a mem - ber of his Lodge or not. The Grand, or Deputy Grand, Master must be received at the door by the two Deacons, the Lodge standing and giving him grand honors; the other Grand Officers are received by the Senior Deacon at the door, the Lodge standing, but without the grand honors; they are then conducted to a seat in the East. Past Masters are entitled to a seat in the East, but are not received by the Lodge standing, the Senior Deacon only meeting them in the center of the room, and conducting them to their appropriate position. It Is the duty of the Master, with the concurrence of the Committee on Funds, to direct that the surplus funds which may be In the hands of the Treasurer be applied to the purchase of puhllc stock, or bank shares, or otherwise disposed of in such maimer as will make them productive to the Lodge, unless they should be specially appropriated by the Lodge. Too little attention is, in general, paid to the qualifica - tion of Masters of Lodges. It is not alone sufficient that they are honest, good men; but they must be well acquainted with Masonry as a science, with the princi - ples and doctrines of the craft, and be able to teach them; they must be men of education and general in - formation, and such as are esteemed in the community. Ambitious seekers of honors, and intriguers for offices, must he discouraged. Everything like party must be dis - countenanced. Virtue and genius, which invarIably are accompanied by humility, must be sought out and placed in offices of honor and trust, as the reward of merit. Such Masters would make our Lodges respectable, In - structive, and useful, and our fellow citizens would then be obliged to acknowledge it an honor to be enrolled under the banners of our Order."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"w.stichtingal’~ua, w. stichtingargu ii. w. stichtingargus. iii w. stichtingargus.n I xv. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichti ngargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichti ngargus.n I xv.stichtingargus. n I xv. stichti ngargus. n I xv. stichti ngargus. ni xv.stichtingargus. iii xv.stichti ngarguNi a! xv.stichtingti,’~~Ilri~hI xv. sti ch t i nga l~[~lI~J iii xv.stichtingnrp.ii~ HI I J r 190 AHIXAN RizoN. SECTION V. OF vHE WAEDENS OF A LoDGE. Master Masons only can be Wardens of a Lodge. Their election shall be in the same manner as the Mas - ter, and their quatifications for office should be nearly the same. The Senior Warden succeeds to all the duties of the Master, and fills the chair when he is absent. If the Master leaves the jurisdiction, dies, or is suspended or expelled by the Grand Lodge, the Senior Warden, or, In his absence, the Junior Warden, shall fill his place until the next stated time of election. If the Master and both Wardens should die, or be expelled, or should leave the jurisdiction, not to return, a new election can be held, under a dispensation from the presiding Grand Officer. It is usual for the Wardens to waive the nrivilei~e of the chair, in compliment to any Past Master of the Lodge that may be present, upon the presumption of his expe - rience and skill in conducting the business of the Lodge. But this offer is perfectly optional with the Wardens, for such Past Master still derives his authority under the Wardens, and cannot act until they congregate the Lodge. If neither the Master nor Wardens are present, the Lodge cannot be opened. Formerly, in the absence of the Warrant Officers, the Senior Past Master could open the Lodge, but, in 18~O, Article 122 of the Consti - tution was amended by adding thereto the words, “but in no case shall the Lodge be opened unless either the Worshipful Master or one of the Wardens be present.” But let us hope, for the honor of the Lodge, that it will never occur, on a regular L.odge night, that there is no officer present, legally qualified to open and to pre - side over the Lodge. Such an occurrence would cer - tainly be disreputable to the of ficera whose vows have been solemnly made at their installation, in the name and in the presence of God. Necessary absence will some- AHIMAN REZON. 191 times take place; but unnecessary, wilful absence should never be indulged. A trifling excuse can never mend a breach of our obligation. An oath is a very serious thing here, and a very awful matter hereafter. The business of the Wardens in the Lodge is, gen - erally, to assist the Master in conducting the business thereof, and managing the craft, In due form and order, when the Master is present, and in performing his duties when he is absent. Particular Lodges, by their By - Laws, assign particular duties to their Wardens for their own better government; which such Lodges have the right to do, provided they do not militate against the ancient landmarks, the Constitution, or rules and regula - tions of the Grand Lodge, or violate the true genius and spirit of Masonry. It is the duty of the Wardens to attend the communI - cations of the Grand Lodge. and, In conjunction with their Master, to act for the good of their Lodge. The Senior Warden appoints his Junior Deacon from among the Master Masons of his Lodge, and the Junior Warden appoints the two Stewards. SECTION VI. Oi THE TREASUKEE OF A LODGE. The Treasurer shall, immediately after his election, give to the Master for the time being, in trust for the Lodge (for the faithful discharge of duty), a bond, with good and sufficient security, in such sum as the By-Laws may require. He Is to keep an exact account of money received, and to pay all orders duly drawn upon him, by the authority of the Lodge, which shall be signed by the Master and countersigned by the Secretary. He is to keep regular entries, both of his receipts and expendi - tures, and to have his books and vouchers always ready for examination, at such periods as the By-Laws require,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"w stichtingai’~~um? w.stichtingargu~. iii w. stichtingargus.i I w. stichtingargu s.n I w. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargu s.nI xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargu s .nl xv. stichtingargu s .nt xv. stichtingargus.n! xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.n! xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichti ngargus.nl xv. stichti ngargus .nl xv.stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichtingargus .nl xv. stichti ngargus .nl xv.stichtingargus .n! xv. stichti ngargus .n! xv. stichti ngargus .nI xv. stichti ngargus.n I xv.stichtingargus. n I xv.stichti ngargus.nI xv.stichti ngargus. iii xv.stichtingargu~,nI xv.stichti flgargUN~flI xv.stichtingargti~,uI xv. stich Ii ngi i’~i ~ iii xv.sttch I flglIt}~Ll~JItt xv.stichhinglir~uib id I I 192 AHINIAN REZON. or whene ier called upon by order of the Master or the Lodge.

D., you have been duly electe4 Senior Warden of this Lodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office. The Level demonstrates that we are descended from the same stock, partake of the same natt~e, and share the same hope; and though distinctions among men are necessary to preserve subordinatiofl, yet no eminence of station should make us forget that we are brethren; for he who is placed on the lowest spoke of fortune’s wheel, may he entitled to our regard; because a time will come, and the wisest knows not how soon, when all distinction, but that of goodness, shall cease; and death, the grand leveler of human greatness, reduce us to the same state. Your regular attendance on our stated meetings is especially necessary. In the absence of the Master, you are to govern the Lodge; in his presence, you are to assisi him in the government of it. I firmly rely on your knowledge of Masonry, and attachment to the Lodge, for the faithful discharge of the duties of this important trust. Look well to the West.

To you is committed the superintendence of the craft during the hours of refreshment; it is, therefore, Indis - pensably necessary that you should not only be temperate and discreet in the indulgence of your own inclinations, but carefully observe that none of the craft be suffered to convert the purposes of refreshment into in temperance and excess. Your regular and punctual attendance is particularly requested; and I have no doubt that you will faithfully execute the duty which you owe to your present appoint - ment. Look well to the South.

Of them let us learn, never to be weary in well-doing, but to “mourn with them that mourn, and to rejoice with them that do rejoice,” until, having finished our work on earth, we shall be admitted to the temple above, “not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” The Grand Marshal then standing in front of the pedestal says: Brethren, behold your Grand Master I Grand Master, behold your brethren I INSTALLATION OF THE Omexas OF A GRAND LoDGE 239 A procession of the craft is then made three times round the Lodge, and the b.rsT~x~ATION ODE Is sung.

These are, the festival of St. John the Baptist, on tbe 24th of June, and that of St. ,John the Evangelist, on tbe 27th of December.

Hence the Grand Lodge has recommended to every Lodge, annually to celebrate one or both of these days in such a way as will be most conducive to the advantage of the Lodge, and the bonor and benefit of the Institution.

If any Grand Officers be present, they must be placed in the rear of the procession, immediately in front of tbe two Wardens. Every officer must wear the jewels of bis office. The Marshal attends on horseback to regulate the procession. On arriving at the church gate, the brethren uncover and open their ranks to the right and left as far as tbe Master, who, followed by the brethren, passes between the lines, likewise uncovered, Into tbe churcb. The same ceremony is observed on their return to tbe Free Masons’ Hall. Divine service must be performed by the Chaplain, and an appropriate address delivered by some competent brother appointed for the occasion.

The grand procession is resumed, and after marchiag three times round the hall, with the Lodge, as at entrance, during which a grand piece of music is performed, the procession returns to the place whence It set out, where the laws of the Order are rehearsed, and the Grand Lodge is closed in ample form. NOTE —When the distance is such that the Grand Master with his Grand Officers can not conveniently attend, he may depute some skillful Past Master to represent him, who may call other worthy brethren to his assistance, and the form of proxy there - fore is the same as that constrained on page 203 for the Constitution of a Lodge, with the necessary verbal alterations. FUNERAL SERVICES 277 SECTION VIII FUNERAL SERVICES MEMORIAL OR COMMIrTrAL SERVICE (This Service may also be used as a graveside Committal Service) The Lodge to which the deceased Brother belonged having been duly opened on the Third Degree, the brethren repair to the place of the Memorial Service. The place may be in a church or funeral chapel. A number of pews or seats should be provided for the members of the deceased Brother’s family and an appropriate number re - served for the brethren. If the Lodge forms a procession to enter the place, the processional should be as shown on page 281. The Master and the Chaplain should stand at the head of the casket and the Senior and Junior Wardens at the foot. The other officers should occupy the first row of seats re - served for the Lodge. The Master can adapt the arrangement of officers to fit the locale if space will not accommodate the foregoing. The Chaplain should keep the lambskin apron and hand it to the Master at the appropriate time. The officers should have sprigs of A cacia in their lapels or breast pockets. THE SERVICE Mo4er— From time immemorial it has been the custom of Freemasons, at the request of a brother, or at the solicitation of his family, to hold a memorial service or accompany his body to the place of interment, and there deposit it with the formalities of our fraternity. In conformity with this usage, we have here assembled in the character of Freemasons, to commemorate the life of our deceased brother and to offer up to his memory, before the world, the last tribute of our affection."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus ii ‘w.stichtingargus.nI ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nl - rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl J rw.stichtingargus.nl ,w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stkhtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl rw stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI rw. stichtingargLls.nI rw.stichtingargus.n I ~w.stichtingarg us. n I rw.stichtingargus. n I rw.stichtingargus. ni rw.stichtingargus,nj ~w.stichtingat’guNId ~w.stichtin~tii}~P~ Iii ‘v.stichtin~tir~,t~ iii ~ iii I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills.

What are the pomp and splendor of majesty, the pnde of wealth, or the charms of beauty, when nature has paid her just debt. When we see life stripped of its ornaments, we will be convinced of the futility of those empty delusions. In death all fallacies are detected, all ranks leveled, all dis - tinctions removed, and the king and the beggar are one We are inclined to forget that we are mortal, we forget that we are born to die! We make plans for many years only to be alarmed at the sudden approach of death when we least expect it, and at an hour when we think our - selves to be in the meridian of our existence Let us, therefore, while in this state of probation, sup - port with dignity and reverence the character of our pro - fession. Let us be true to the solemn ties of our fraternity, and loyal to the teachings of the Holy Scripture, the Great Light of Masonry Then with becoming reverence let us seek the divine grace and favor of the Eternal Being whose goodness, power, and mercy knows no bound, that when our own summons comes we may pursue our jour - ney, without dread or apprehension, to that undiscovered country from whose hourne no traveler ever returns The Great Creator having been pleased to remove our Brother from this transitory life to a state of eternal dura - tion may we who survive him prepare for our own ap - proaching fate May we be more strongly cemented in the ties of friendship and brotherly love, so that we may mu - tually promote the welfare and happiness of each other to the honor and glory of God, and to the salvation of our own souls.

Think how soon death, for you, will be a reality. Man’s life is like a flower, which blooms today. and tomorrow is faded, cast aside, and trodden under foot. The most of us, my brethren, are fast approaching, or have already passed the meridian of life, our sun Is sinkIng in the West, and 01 how much more swift is the passage of our declining years than when we started upon the journey, and beileved— as the young are too apt to believe—that the roseate hues of the rising sun of our existence were always to be continued. When we look back upon the happy days of our childhood, when the dawning intellect first began to exercise its powers of thought, it seems but as yester - day, and that, by a simple effort of the will, we could put aside our manhood, and seek again the loving caresses of a mother, or be happy in the possession of a bauble; and could we now realize the idea that our last day had come, our whole earthly life would seem but as the space of time from yesterday until today. Cen - tunes upon centuries have rolied away behind us; before us stretches out an eternity of years to come; and upon the narrow boundary between the past and the present flickers the puny taper we term our life. When we caine into the world we knew naught of what had been before us, but, as we grew up to manhood, we learned of the past; we saw the flowers bloom as they had bloomed for centuries; we beheld the orbs of day and night pursuing ~heir endless course among the stars, and as they pur - sued it from the birth of light; we learned what men had thought, and said, and done, from the beginning of the world to our day; but only through the eye of faith can we behold what Is to come hereafter, and only LODGE or Soaxow 287 through a firm relIance upon the Divine promises can we satisfy the yearnings of an immortal soul. The cradle speaks to us of remembrances, the coffin of hope, of a blessed trust in a glorious Immortality, and a never-ending existence beyond the gloomy portals of the tomb I Let these reflections convince us how vain are ail the wranglings and bitternesses engendered by the colilsions of the world, how little In dignity above the puny strug - gles of ants over a morsel of food or for the possession of an inch of soil. What shall survive us? Not, let us hope, the petty strifes and bitternesses, the jealousies and heartburn - ings, the small trials and mean advantages we have gained, but rather the noble thoughts, the words of truth, the works of mercy and justice, that ennoble and light up the existence of every honest man, however humble, and live for good when his body, like this remnant of humanity, is mouldering in its parent dust. Let the proud and vain consider how soon the gaps are filled that are made in society by those who die around them, and how soon time heals the wounds that death inflicts upon the loving heart; and from this let them learn humanity, and that they are but drops In the great ocean of humanity. And when God sends His Angel to us with the scroll of Death, let us look upon It as an act of mercy. to pre - vent many sins and many calamities of a longer life, and lay our heads softly down like One “Who wraps the drapery of hIs couch about him, And lies down to pleasant dreams.” From this, at least, man learns by death that his calamities are not immortal.

Behold I He taketh away. and who can hinder Him? Man that is born of a woman is of a few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with Thee. Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; turn from him that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. For there is hope of a tree if it be cut down, that It will sprout again, and that the tenderer branches thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old In the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground, yet through the scent of water It wlil bud and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where Is he? As the waters fall from the sea. and the flood decayeth and drietli up, so man Ileth down, and riseth not; till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep. My days are passed, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. If I wait, the grave is mine house, I have made my bed In the darkness. I have said to corruption “thou art my father.” And where Is now thy hope? As for my hope, who will see It? They shall go down to the bars of the pit, where our rest together is in the dust. My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh. Oh I that my words were now written; Oh I that they were printed In a book; that they were graven with an Iron I, LODGE OF Soaaow 289 pen and laid in the rock forever I For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms shall destroy this body, yet In my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. For Thou cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and Thy floods compassed me about; all Thy bil - lows and Thy waves passed over me. Then I said, I am east out of Thy sight; yet will I look again toward Thy holy temple. The waters compassed me about, even to the soul, the depths closed me around about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. I said, in the cutting off of my day I shall go to the gates of my grave; I am deprived of the residue of my years; I said, I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. Behold I for peace I had great bitterness; but Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption. For the grave cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee; the living, the living, be shall praise Thee as I do this day. Are not my days few? Cease, then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness, and the shadow of death.

And whenever distress and trouhle may hereafter come upon us, may we ever be consoled by the reflection that Thy wisdom and Thy love are equally infinite, and that our sorrows are not the vIsita - tions of Thy wrath, but the result of the great law of harmony by which everything is being conducted to a good and perfect issue in the fullness of Thy time. Let the loss of our brethren Increase our affection for those who are yet spared to us, and make us more punctual in the performance of the duties that Friendship, Love, acid Honor demand. When it comes to us also to die, may a finn and abiding trust in Thy mercy dispel the gloom and dread of dissolution. Be with us now, that we may serve Thee in spirit and understanding.

While, therefore, nature will have its way, and our tears will fall upon the paves of our brethren, let us be reminded by the evergreen, symbol of our faith in immortal life, that the dead are but sleeping, and be comforted by the reflection that their memories will not be forgotten; that they will still be loved hy those who are so soon to follow them; that in our archives their names are written, and that in our hearts there is still a place for them.

M.—Brother Chaplain, read to us from Holy Writ, that Great Light in Masonry, words of comfort and hope, to cheer us in our darkness and despondency. The Chaplain will then proceed to the catafalque, where he will recite the following or other appropriate passages of Scripture: Chaplain—But some men will say, how are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which lhou sowest is not quickened except to die; and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain; It may chance of wheat or of some other pain; but God giveth it a hody as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body. All flesh is not the same flesh; hut there is one kind of flesh of men. another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial; but the glory of the celestial Is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star dif - fereth from another star in glory. So also in the resur - rection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, It is raIsed in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, It Is raised in glory; It is sown in weakness, It is raised In power; It is sown a natural body, it Is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, the first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which Is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from Heaven.

The (‘haplain will return to his place in the East, and simultaneously with the turning on of the lights, the choir should sing a triumphant hymn.

Tell us the story of their lives, and recount their virtues, that we may remember and imitate them.

M.—Brother Senior Warden, our recollections of our departed brothers have been refreshed, and we may now ask ourselves were they just and perfect Masons, worthy men, unwearied toilers in the vineyard, and possessed of so many virtues as to overcome their faults and shortcomings? Answer these questions as Masons should answer. S. W.— Worshipful Sir, man judgeth not of man. He, whose infinite and tender mercy passeth all comprehen - sion, whose goodness endureth forever, has called our brethren hence. Let Him judge. In ancient Egypt, no one could gain admittance to the sacred asylum of the tomb until he had passed under the most solemn judgment before a grave tribunal. Princes and peasants came there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted the history of their lives, and threw the pene - trating light of Iruth on all theIr actions. If it were adjudged that the dead man had led an evil life, his memory was condemned hi the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. Masonry has no such tribunal to sit In judgment upon her dead; with her, the good which her sons have done lives after them, and the evil is interred with their bones. She does require, however, that whatever is said con - cerning them shall be the truth; and should it ever happen that of a Mason who dies nothing good can be truthfully said, she will mournfully and pityingly bury him out of her sight in silence."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"xv. stichtingargus, iii xv.stichtingargus.n I xv. stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl ‘w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichti ngargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl ~w. sti chtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ‘w.stichtingargus.nl rw stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nI rvv. stichti ngargus.n I rw.stichtingargus. n I rw.stichtingargus. n I rw.stichtingargus. n I rw.stichtingargLls, iii rw.stichtinga:rgti~, ft I ~v.stichtingargu~ 1)1 ‘~v.stichtinMal’M,v~ iii ‘vv.stichti l1M(IrJfIl~J iii ‘~v.stichtioMtic~s~ I~ Ill ~v.stichtIi~Mt~IMilo iii ‘~v.st’ichtII)Mdi Mtln iii ‘vv.stich(I I ltJfl ~dI I’i lii ‘~v.stichiInew t!IIn iii ‘V.StiCIltiIltj.!~4l~~i.’ iii ‘~v.s1 iclill I I~fi MP1 siN I 296 LODGE OF Soaaow W.

REGULATIONS FOR Paocuszox. When the Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master or either of the Grand Wardens, joins the procession of a private Lodge, proper respect is to be paid to the rank of that officer. His position will be immediately before the Master and Wardens of the Lodge, and two Deacons will be appointed to attend him. When the Grand or Deputy Grand Master is present, the Book of Constitutions will be borne before him. The honor of carrying this book belongs of right to the Master of the oldest Lodge in the jurisdiction, whenever he is present in allusion to the fact that the Constitutions of the Order were originally vested in that officer, and that on him the business of the Grand Lodge devolves, in case of the absence of all the Grand Officers, and also because it was a custom adopted soon after the reorgan - ization of the Grand Lodge of England, for the Master of the oldest Lodge to attend every Grand Installation, and taking precedence of all others, the Grand Master only excepted, to deliver the Book of Constitutions to the newly installed Grand Master, thereby to remind him of his obligation to preserve the ancient landmarks and constitutions inviolate. The Book of Constitutions must never be borne in a procession unless the Grand or Deputy Grand Master be present. In entering public buildings, the Bible, Square, and Compasses, and the Book of Constitutions, are to be placed In front of the Grand Master, and the Grand Marshal and Grand Deacons must keep near him. When a procession faces forward, the Deacons and Stewards will cross their rods, so as to form an arch for the brethren to pass beneath."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"xv.stichtingargu~ xv. stichtingargus .n I xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ~w. stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl r~y~ stichtingargus.nl rw. stichtingargus.nl ixv.stichtingargus.nl rxv. stichtingargus.nl ~w.stichtingargus.n1 ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ‘w.stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichti ngargus.nl rw.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nI ixv.stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nI rw. stichtingargus. ni rw.stichtingargus. n I rw.stichtingargus, fl I rw. stichtingargu~,u I ~w.stichtingargiw~d ~ lii ~v.stichtIn~ui~i~ iii ~v.stichtia~tir~i P4 ‘II ~ iii ~VV.StiCh{Itt$AltI ~i i~ it) ~vv.stichi I i~ii V’ 1~ itt ~v.sticht ii Ip~1~ iii ¶ Li’ CONSTITUTION AND CODE OF THE Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Ancient Free Masons of the State of South Carolina COMPILED BY Charles Inglesby, Grand Secretary (1874-1906) WITh ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS BY 0 Frank Hart, Grand Secretary (1910-1950) AND Henry F.

Lodge, itis not to be understood that rules of Law heretofore expressed by Grand Lodge enactment may not have force as unwritten law, if comprehended within the definition given. The purpose is to render the written law more accessible to the Craft for practical use, by limiting the scope of its record, and specifying where it is to be found. In other words, the design of this Code, as to previous Grand Lodge enactments not embraced herein, is to destroy their force and effect as written law, and repeal them for all purposes wherein they are repugnant to its provisions. SEc. 7. Code, and When It Takes Effect.—These laws, when compiled and published, shall be designated the “MASONIC CODE OF SOuTH CASoLINA,” and shall be divided into chapters and sections, each to be num - bered consecutively from one (I) to the highest num - ber given. And for purposes of reference and citation it may be known as the “Code,” adding as it may be necessary the section; and all amendments hereto, when offered in Grand Lodge, shall specify the section of the Code, according to the intent; and if to add new chap - ten or sections, it shall so state, and number the same, The intenlion being, not only that the enactments at the time of adopting the Code, but all subsequent enact - ments as written law, shall be embraced herein; and the provisions of this Code shall take effect and be of force from and after the 15th day of December, 1897. SEC. 8. Amendments.—AII proposed amendments to this Code must be in writing, presented to the Grand Lodge. and by it referred to the Committee on Juris - prudence, which shall report thereon before the close of the second day of the communication; and no final action shall be taken on any proposed amendment until CODE OF THE GIIAND Lonoz. 341 it has been so referred and opportunity afforded for said committee to report thereon. Sgc. 9. Same—How Proposed and Adopted.— Amendments to this Code may be made by a majority vote of the Lodges represented at the communication and the permanent members entitled to votes voting. Propositions to amend any section of the Cede shall not be to strike therefrom, nor add thereto, but the propo- sition shall contain the section rewritten to express the law as intended, and shall be a substitute for the section amended. SEC. 10. Decisions of Grand Master.—The Grand Master may, in his discretion, in his annual address, report to the Grand Lodge decisions upon Masonic law made by him during its recess. If approved by the Grand Lodge, they do not have the force and effect of written law, nor are they binding as correct expressions of the unwritten law. They are to have the effect of an approval of the act of the Grand Master in the par - ticular instance and are of value only as an opinion formed upon an ex parse statement without an issue submitted in a proceeding requiring judicial determina - tion. SEC 11. Recommendations Not Law.—A recommenda - tion of the Grand Master in his address as to changes in, alterations of, or additions to, the law, although concurred in by the Grand Lodge in its actions thereon, or on the report of a committee to which it has been referred, shall not be of force or effect as law merely by reason of such action, but to render it a legal enactment it must be presented to the Grand Lodge in writing, independent of such address or report, and then be referred and adopted as by law provided. It is the intention that in no case shall the adoption of a report have the effect of enacting or changing a provision of the Code.

(Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a committee from accompanying its report with a draft for a change in the law, in accordance with a recommendation or otherwise, or from making recommendations or statements as to such draft; but the action of the Grand Lodge in its enactments must be independent of its action on the report.) Stc. 12. Actions on Appeal.—Cases reported by the Committee on Appeals and Grievances, coming to the Grand Lodge on appeal under the forms of law, are proper judicial proceedings, and the action of the Grand Lodge upon their report touching the legal ques - tions involved are judicial in their nature and are to be considered as correct interpretations of existing laws, whether written or unwritten.

D. the dispensation under which the Lodge has been working contin ues of force until the Lodge is consti - tuted under its charter. Sec. 17. Constituted.—When a new Lodge is organ - ized and its charter issued, it must be constituted under the forms and usages of the institution by the Grand Master or some Master or Past Master duly authorized, with the officers named in the dispensation and charter. Sgc. 18. Charter.—The control of the charter is with the Master of the Lodge. It is the certificate of its organization, and should be kept in the Lodge room, ready to be produced whenever called for: but its tem - porary absence from the room does not vitiate work done. The charter does not create the Lodge. That is done by the action of the Grand Lodge, of which the charter is merely the evidence. While, therefore, its presence in the room is eminently proper and desirable, it is not absolutely necessary. Sec. 19. Arrest of Charter.—(See Chapter II, Article 35, of the Constitution.) SEC. 20. Revocation of Charter.—The Grand Lodge may revoke the charter of a Subordinate Lodge for disobe - dience of its orders, rules or laws; for insubordination; when - ever in its judgment the condition of the Lodge as to discipline, or otherwise, is such that its longer existence is deleterious to the honor and usefulness of the Craft; or whenever its depreciated condition as to number, finances, or interest in the work, shall render revocation proper. Szc. 21. Arrest and Revocation.—The arrest of a charter is a mere temporary suspension of the func - tions of the Lodge until final action shall be had by the Grand Lodge. The revocation of a charter is the action of the Grand CODE OF THE GUAXD Lone.. 357 Lodge on final hearing declaring it forfeited, when the Lodge beconies extinct. The Grand Lodge, upon final hearing, may approve or disapprove the action of the Grand Master; and although it may approve the action of the Grand Mas - ter in making the arrest, it may restore the charter without revocation, if satisfied that the discipline is already sufficient, aud the good of the Craft will be thereby subserv~’d. It being the intention that the Grand Lodge in such cases may exercise a full discre - tion, having in view the advantages of a wholesome discipline and the welfare of the Craft. Sec. 22. Charter Lost—Whenever the charter of a Lodge in good standing shall be lost or destroyed, on proper proof a duplicate thereof shall be issued by the Grand Secretary, who shall report the fact to the Grand Lodge at its ne~ct annual communication. Sec. 23. Surrender of Charter.—When any Lodge shall contemplate the voluntary surrender of its char - ter, the proposition therefor shall be submitted at a regular communication, or if for any reason its regu - lar communicati~us are being omitted, then the propo - sition may be presented to the Master or Secretary. If presented at a regular communication, action thereon shall be held at tie next regular communication held by the Lodge. If the proposition is presented to the Mas - ter or Secretary, for the reason that there are no meet - ing~ of the Lodge, then action shall not be had till the time for the second regular communication after it is so presented. Nor shall any such action be had until each member of the Lodge has been notified of such contemplated action, by a notice to him in writing, addressed to him at his last known place of residence, which notice shall be mailed at least ten days before"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"w. stichtingarg us, ni w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. xt i cht i ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus . n w. stichtingarg us. n I w. stichtingargus. ut w.stichtingargu~,n I w.stichti ngargtu~. fl I xv.stichtingal’guN~ til xv. stichtingargu~4,aI w.stichtingal’~Iuwld xv.stichti ngau’~wuiI w.stichti ngtit’{~,u.iw iii xv.stichtingtu:’~tlt4 iii xv.stichti fl~tll {~U~ iii ¶ 358 COnz OF THE GRAND LODGE. the contemplated action.

The Entered Apprentices and Fellow Crafts of such Lodge become the Masonic material of the nearest Lodge to their place of residence, and upon a like certifi - cate are entitled to apply for advancement therein SEC. 26 Members in Fault.—No certificate shall be is - sued as contemplated in the preceding section, in favor of any member of the Lodge against whom a complaint shall be lodged with the Grand Secretary to the effect that the re - vocation of the charter was caused by his misconduct, in the whole or in part, until directed by the Grand Lodge. In such case the action of the Grand Lodge may be invoked by the petition of the member seeking the certificate, and there - upon the Grand Lodge shall havejurisdiction and may inves - tigate and decide the matter in a summary way, and at its discretion, having in view the equitable rights of all concerned.

The payment, however, of such dues and the receipt therefor places the brother in the position of a demitted Mason, with the perfect right, notwithstanding such rejection, to seek admittance as a member in any other Lodge in the world. His re - jection by the Lodge does not entitle him to demand repayment of the dues so paid by him. SEC 133. Status of One Erased.—The status of a Mason whose name has been erased for N.

The Lodge is empowered to remit said dues in full or any part thereof at any time as in its discretion it may see fit, but said remission does not release said Lodge I rom the payment of dues to the Grand Lodge on the said brother. Provided, that for the duration of any war in which the United States shall be engaged, and for six months ihereafter. the annual dues for any member serving in the armed forces of the Nation, if remitted by his Lodge, shall not be included in the calculation of the amount of dues from that Lodge to the Grand Lodge, or of the amount due for relief. CHAPTER XIII. Of Reinstatem ents. Sac. 136. Reinstatement.—A Mason expelled or sus - pended in this jurisdiction for un-Masonic conduct may be reinstated: 1.

It is the free COnx OF THE Ga.~xn LODGE. and voluntary action of the Lodge, and is good at any time, but is evidence of character only at the time when it is granted. It can be granted only on the written application of the brother, and at a regular communica - tion of the Lodge. A demit must not be conditional, as “upon payment of dues.” It must be absolute and if granted with dues un - paid, the dues are remitted. Szc. 148. Who May Apply For.—Any member of a Lodge who is in good standing—that is, not under charges, and who has paid in full his arrears—may apply for and is eligible to receive a demit. In such case, should the application be refused by the Lodge. by the votes of a majority of the brethren present at the communication and participating in the ballot, the said application shall be deemed and taken as a Masonic rcsignation of membership in that particular Lodge, and the brother shall be no longer a member or chargeable h dues, and shall be entitled to a certificate from the Secretary wit of the Lodge stating that he has paid up his dues in full, is not under charges, and has resigned his membership.

To Whom a Demit May Not Be Granted. —A demit cannot be granted: 1. To one under charges. 2. To an Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft. 3. To a duly installed officer of a Lodge until the expiration of his term of office. Should he, however, after being elected, decline to be installed, he does not become an officer—the office remains unfilled, and the brother may, therefore, if so minded, demit, unless his election was to the office held by him the previous year, in which case he cannot demit until said office is filled in a lawful manner."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargu~.

If the complaint is to the Grand Lodge, it may assume jurisdiction or not, at its discretion; and if it does, it may act thereon at its discretion and upon such notice as it may deem just. If filed with the Grand Master during a recess of the Grand Lodge, and he deems the complaint deserving of consideration, he may notify the Lodge thereof, and at his discretion, by committee or otherwise, make inquiry into the facts for information and action of the Grand Lodge.

Sac. 156. Technicalities.—In any case where a right of action or inquiry is given in the Grand Lodge the same shall not be dismissed For the reason that no form or method of precedure is presented by the Code; but in such cases the Form of the inquiry or proceedings shall be discretionary, having in view the attainment of just results; it being the intention that the provisions of the law, in their essence and spirit, shall be observed, but that technical deviations there - from, not prejudicial nor in violation of an absolute right, shall not defeat its application, nor avoid its judgment. Sac. 157. Grand Master.—Nothing in this Code shall be construed to prevent any Lodge or Mason, during the recess 0* the Grand Lodge, from invoking the action and order of the Grand Master for the protection or maintenance of any Masonic right until such time as the Grand Lodge may act in the prem - ises, and the action and orders of the Grand Master shall be of force therein until set aside or modified by the Grand Lodge; and in such cases the Grand Master may act in such manner and upon such notice to the parties in interest as he may deem just.

Sac. 160. Review.—In every case where the jewel of an officer is arrested, either in the Grand or in a Subordinate Lodge, the officer thus deposed shall have the right to have his case heard upon its merits in the Grand Lodge; and to that end he may peti - tion the Grand Lodge therefor, setting forth in his petition the particulars of his grievance. The Grand Lodge shall thereupon have jurisdiction, and may proceed to the investigation in a summary way and at its discretion, keeping in view the attainment of Masonic justice. Sac. 161. Restoration.—It is competent for the offi - cer on whose authority a jewel is arrested to restore the same whenever in his judgment justice and the good of the Craft require it. Sac. 162. Effect of Arrest —The effect of arresting a jewel shall be to suspend the officer from all the functions of his office; and its restoration shall fully restore him thereto; but such arrest shall not other - wise affect his standing as a Mason."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl -w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w~4ichtingargus.n1 wstichtingargus.nI w stichtingargus.nl ~w. stichtingargus.nI ~w. stichtingargus.nI w .stichtingargus.nI w stichtingargus .n I w stichtingargus.n I w stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus ri I w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargu~,nI - w stichtingargus.id I w.stichtingargu~nt w.stichtingargu~id w.stichtinga rt~u~id ‘w. stichtingalgilNail xv.stichti ng~i t’~iit~, iii w.stichtingtirpu~ id ¶ I 402 CODE OF TINE GRAND LODGE.

They must be closed at the order of the Worshipful Master. A Lodge having held its communication should be closed in due form the same day or night and not left open or “calied off” until a meeting two or three days later. Such an adjourned meeting would be an extra communica - tion. Szc. 176. Ancient Charges.—The Ancient Charge, requiring the Master to have served as a Warden shall be strictly enforced in thus Jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this Code. Szc. 177. Applications for Assistance.—It shall not be lawful for Lodges or individual Masons to send out begging circulars without the approval of the Grand Master; nor shall Subordinate Lodges enter - tain begging circulars from foreign Masons or Lodges which have not the approval of the Grand Master of the Jurisdiction from which they come.

SEC. 187. Constitution and of Code.—Each Subordinate Lodge in the Jurisdiction shall keep a copy of the Consttu - tion of the Grand Lodge, together with its proceedings under the same, and also a copy of this Code, for the inspection of its members; and it shall be the duty of the Masters thereof to observe the same and see that they are strictly enforced in the Lodges over which they preside; and the published pro - ceedings of the Grand Lodge shall be conclusive evidence of all matters contained therein. SEc. 188. Debate—How Closed.—In Grand Lodge, at the will and pleasure of the Most Worshipful Grand Master. In Subordinate Lodges, at the will and pleasure of the Worshipful Master. SEC. 189. Decisions ol Grand Master.—Decisions of the Grand Master govern in the particular case in which they are rendered until set aside by the Grand Lodge, but do not become law by force of being ren - dered. They are of value beyond the particular case only to the extent of their conformity to exist - ing laws. SEC. 190. Same—Who to Ask For.—The Master of a Lodge may inquire of the Grand Master as to the law for government of his Lodge in a particular case, and his opinion in regard thereto is official and should govern the Lodge; but such an opinion is not a “decision,” as a decision in legal contemplation must arise on a controverted point or question, to which there should be parties having particular interests, with a right to seek a review thereof in the Grand Lodge. Answers by the Grand Master to letters from other members of a Lodge, giving his opinion as to law or fact, are not official in the sense that they must con - trol or govern either the Lodge or others. SEC. 191. Same—Of Grand Lodge—How Obtained. —]t shall be competent for any member of the CODE OF THE GRAND LODGE. 407 Grand Lodge to invoke its judicial determination upon a question of law as applicable to a given state of facts, as follows: The member shall present to the Grand Lodge a statement of facts, in writing, and the legal question which he claims to be involved. The Grand Lodge, if it entertains the question, shall refer it to the Committee on Masonic Jurisprudence, who shall report thereon. The action of the Grand Lodge on such report shall be deemed a judicial expression of the law of such a case. Szc. 192. Delegate.—A delegate to represent the Lodge in Grand Lodge can be appointed only in the absence of the Master and both Wardens, and only one delegate can be appointed. SEC. 193. Affiliation — Conditional. — II a brother wishes to change his membership and be continuously affiliated; he may file his petition with any regular Lodge and with it a receipt under seal from the Secretary ol the Lodge of which he is a member, showing that his dues have been paid for thiee months in advance; also, a written application to his Lodge for a demit. If elected to membership in the Lodge petitioned, the Secretary thereof shall immediately forward said application for demit to the Lodge from which the brother wishes to withdraw, and when the demit is received shall file it with the petition and enter the brother’s name as a member of the Lodge petitioned as of even date with the certificate of demit. If the petitioner be rejected, the aforesaid re - ceipt for dues and application for demit shall be re - turned to him. Szc. 194. Dotage—When In.—No particular age is conclusive evidence of dotage. With one person it is earlier in life than with another. It is a question for the Lodge, having in view the fact that we seek material for use, not as waste nor as an incumbrance. Sue. 195.

Motion—When Necessary.—The action of the Lodge should be invoked by motion only in cases where there is something for the Lodge to decide; that is, where it can legally say “yes” or “no” to a proposition or question. If the Lodge must vote “yes,” then no vote is necessary. The Master may do or order the thing done, without a vote. No motion is necessary to appoint a committee on a petition for degrees or membership, as, when such a motion would be made, a committee must be appointed. No motion is necessary to spread the ballot; at the proper time it must be spread. Szc. 212. Notice In Appeal and Other Cases.—In cases before the Grand Lodge on appeal, for review, for decision, or wherein the Grand Lodge has original jurisdiction, it is made the duty of the Grand Secre - tary, after the close of the Grand Lodge communica - tion, to notify the accused, or the party interested and the Lodge, of the result or action taken by the Grand Lodge In the premIses.

Same.—When a Lodge opens on the Master Mason Degree and closes in short form, opening in like manner on an inferior degree, the Lodge may close in due form on the inferior degree without opening again on the Master Mason Degree. If business in the Master Mason Degree requires the Lodge to be opened again on that degree, then the Lodge must close the inferior Lodge in short form CODE OF THE GRAND LODGE. for if once opened in due form it cannot open again in due form on the Master Mason Degree without the same becom - ing an extra communication except such as the extra commu - nication may be specially called for under the law SEc 215 Past Master.—The right of a Past Master to membership in the Grand Lodge is not an inher - ent vested right, when he is not representing his Lodge, and is simply in Grand Lodge by reason of his being a Past Master, he has no vote, and cannot introduce a resoiution or make a motion in Grand Lodge.

Postponement.—The postponement of a resolution from one annual communication to an - other is equivalent to a rejection. SEc. 218.

If the record is to be changed it should be by an additional record, stat - mg the cliatige or correction, and what it is. No Lodge can, at an extra communication, alter or ex - punge the proceedings of a regular communication. SEC. 219. Same—On What Authority Made—Cor - rections, when unquestioned, shall be made by order of the Master. If questioned, by motion and a vote of the Lodge. Szc. 220.

Printing.—The Grand Secretary shall ad - vertise for estimates for printing the proceedings of the Grand Lodge, and when all things are equal, shall give the advantage, if any there be, to Master Masons in good standing. Szc. 222. Promulgation.—Neither a brother nor a Lodge has a right to promulgate a communication made in the form of charges made by one brother against another, containing criminal accusations, nor any fact which transpires within the Lodge or in Masonic confidence. Sac. 223. Same—When Lawful.—When in the judg - ment of a Lodge the good of Masonry requires that its action with reference to disciplining a brother for grossly immoral conduct should be known to the world, it shall be lawful to publish such action in the public journals. Szc. 224. Regalia.—AII members or delegates to the Grand Lodge are required to bring with them their appropriate regalia. Sac. 225. Resignations— Masonic.— (See Section 148.) SEC. 226. Repealed 1984. Sec. 227. Relief—Who Entitled To.—Affiliated Mas - ter Masons in good standing and their widows and orphans are entitled to Masonic relief, and none other. A brother or a Lodge furnishing relief is not entitled to demand reimbursement: Provided, however, That it is made the duty of any Lodge within the Jurisdiction furnishing relief to a brother to notify the Lodge from which the distressed brother hails. Sac. 228. Remission of Dues.—The failure of the Lodge to erase the name of a member from the roll for nonpayment of dues does not operate as a re - mission of dues. The remission must be by express action of the Lodge. CODE OF THE Gioom LODGE 413 SEC. 229. Representatives to Other Grand Lodges. —The system of representatives to other Grand Lodges is approved of and commended by this Grand Body. SEC. 230.

Sec. 232. Summons—Definition Of.—A simple no - tice is not the “summons” referred to in Masonic obligations, and the practice of using the word “sum - moned” in simple notices, and of publishing in news - papers so-called summons for ordinary meetings, etc., is error and is hereby interdicted. A Masonic sum - mons, e. g., for Lodge trials, so far as Lodge duties are concerned, must be issued by the Master, and must be for grave and important reasons. It may be either oral or written. If in writing, it should be over the signature of the Master, or by his order, and be attested by the Secretary under the seal of the [.odge. A “summons” or “token” from one individ - ual Mason to another is a demand for the perform - ance of some duty inculcated or commanded in the obligations, or for the nonperformance or ceasing to perform some act forbidden in the same. A refusal or neglect to answer and obey a “summons,” as defined herein, is a violation of the 0. B., and is, therefore, disciplinable. SEC. 233.

An unaf - filiated or nonaffiliated Mason is one who has no membership in any recognized Lodge. If his Lodge is defunct and he is unaffiliated only for that reason, he may be one of the petitioners for the revival of his old Lodge. An unaffiliated Mason is not in good standing and cannot be one of the seven applicants for a dispensation to form a new Lodge. but he, nevertheless, remains subject to the government of the Order, and may be tiied and punished for any offense by the Lodge within whose jurisdiction he resides. SEC. 237. Same.—As a brother applying for affilia - tion must present a demit from his Lodge, a brother who has taken a demit for the purpose of such application for affiliation is not to be held as an un - affiliat~~ Mason. Should he have applied for affilia - tion and die before action could be taken by the Lodge upon such application, he shall be considered to have died an affiliated Mason, and entitled to all the rights and benefits of such. SEC. 238. Same—Rights Of.—1. He can apply for affiliation; 2, he can visit a Lodge once: Provided, Such visit is for the purpose of affiliation; 3, he can lawfully prefer charges against a member in good standing, but it must be done as a profane, through some brother in good standing and in his name.

Unfavorable Report.—Except as provided in Section 98, it is improper for a committee to give reasons for an unfavorable report on an application for the degrees, for advancement or for membership.

Every member of a Lodge has the right of objecting to the admission of any visitor to his Lodge, but the validity of his objection is to be determined by the Master of the Lodge, who alone has the right to exclude. SEc. 241. Same—Presentation of a Certificate.— (See Articles 114 and 167 of the Constitution.)—Wliile the presentation of a certificate is not necessary to the examination or admission of a visitor, it is very desirable, and when none is presented especial cau - tion must be used. SEc. 242. Voting.—No question shall be decided in the Grand Lodge or in a Subordinate Lodge viva voce except by unanimous consent. SEc. 243. How Vote Is to Be Taken.—In all ques - tions in the Grand Lodge or Subordinate Lodges, which are competent by the By-Laws to be decided by acclamation, the vote shall be taken by holding up the right hand, and the formula for proposing the question from the Chair shall be in these words: “So many as are in favor of this motion will hold up the right hand at the blow of the gavel”; and after - wards: “So many as are opposed to it will make the same sign.” When necessary, the uplifted hands shall be counted by the Senior Deacon, who shall report the same to the Presiding Officer.

Work in South Carolina.—The Ritual as revised and adopted by the Grand Lodge in 1894 is a system derived indirectly from Webb, and differing in no essential part from the Webb work, it is, therefore, recog - nized in this Jurisdiction as the correct work, and must be adopted by the Subordinate Lodges.

No atheist can be made a Mason, nor has the institution a fitting place for one who, after ac - ceptance, shall be found to be or to have become an atheist. Hence the fact that one who has been re - ceived as a Mason is an atheist is a Masonic offense, and upon conviction thereof he shall stand expelled. SEC 249 Expulsion Upon Court Sentence.—Where a Mason has been sentenced by any State or Federal court upon his conviction of~ or his plea of guilty or nob con - tendere to any felony or crime involving moral turpitude which discredits Masonry, he shall stand expelled Upon receipt of a certified copy of his conviction or plea, and of the sentence imposed therefor by the court, the Grand Master shall give notice of such expulsion to the Secretary of his Lodge, and he shall be erased from its roll Such Lodge, and no other, may receive and act upon an applica - tion for reinstatement from him in the manner and sub - ject to the provisions and limitations set forth in Section 119 of the Code SEC. 250 Charges—Effect Of.—The effect of’ being under Masonic charges does not exclude a Mason from the privilege of preferring Masonic charges against another, nor do charges against a brother, before trial, render him ineligible to office or suspend him from office, he being en - titled to the presumption of innocence until the charges be proven. They, however, so far affect his standing as to render him, during their pendency, ineligible to demit. SEC. 251 Same—Who to Prefer.—Any brother in good standing may prefer charges.

Same—Over a Past Master.—Nor shall any past Master be put on trial before a Subordinate Lodge for any official misconduct while Master of a Lodge; but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a Lodge having jurisdiction from prosecut - ing charges against a Past Master for conduct while Master of a Lodge for which he might then have been prosecuted had he not been Master. Szc. 267. Allegations—Proof.—The fact that there is a difference between the time as alleged and proved will not defeat the charge. The time is not malerial, nor is the place, except that it should not be so stated as to mislead in the proofs or the defense. It should be somewhere near the time and place alleged. SEC. 268. Notice.—No Lodge shall have jurisdic - tion to try a charge against a Mason until the ac - cused shall be notified and served with a copy of the charges.

But in either case—thai is, whether the service be personal or otherwise—the jurisdiction of the Lodge attaches. SEC. 275.

If on ihe trial the accused shall be convicted and the punishment imposed be different from the former, then the former judgmeni shall stand modified to conform to the latter. The mere fact of retrial does not affeci the former judgment. Such judg - ment is only affected by the trial when the judgment of retrial is different, and then only to conform thereto. And the date of the judgment in either case is that of the former judgment. SEC. 278.

Counsel.—In a Masonic trial the accused has the right 10 employ any Master Mason in good standing to appear as his counsel. If the accused be not present or represented, the Lodge, in its discre - tion, may appoint some brother to represent him. SEC. 280. Appearance—How—The appearance of the accused shall be in one of the following methods: 1. By his personal presence at the time and place of which he has had notice. 2. By the appearance for him of his’ counsel as authorized to be appointed by him in Section 279. 3. By his written communication, or that of his counsel, filed with the Secretary at any time before or at such regular communication, in which he may state his objection to the charge or his plea of guilty or not guilty, or any matter in explanation or ex - tenuation of the offense charged. 4. At the beginning of the Trial or Trial Commission the Accused shall relinquish his Receipt of Dues Card to the Presiding Officer. Failure of the Accused to comply with this requirement shall constitute a Masonic Offense as defined in Section 248 (e) of the Code. 5. Upon a Verdict of Not Guilty, the Accused shall immediately have the Receipt of Dues Card returned to him. If However, the Accused is found Guilty, and the Penalty imposed is Expulsion or Suspension the Receipt CODE OF THE GRAHD LODGE. 427 of Dues Card shall be retained by the Lodge, in the case of a Trial Commission the Receipt of Dues Card shall be immediately forwarded to the Lodge.

Object, or Plead.—A party appearing in a proceeding against him br a Masonic offense must either object to each charge against him or plead thereto. Sec. 284. Objection.—An objection to a charge is a statement in writing, signed by the accused or by his counsel, or stated by them to the Secretary and by him entered of record as follows: “The accused ob - jects to the (first) charge against him upon the ground that the said charge does not state a Masonic offense.” (See Chapter XXI.) Or, “upon the ground that the Lodge has no jurisdiction as to the offense charged.” (See Chapter XXII.) The effect of such objection is to say that, admitting the state - ments of the charge to be true, it is not a triable Masonic offense, or, as the case may be, the Lodge has not jurisdiction to try the offense. This ques - tion may be argued, but must be decided by the Lodge without evidence, by the Master asking: “Brethren, do you sustain the objection to the charger” And the question shall be decided by a show of hands and a majority vote. If the objec - tion is sustained, the charge shall be dismissed by order of the Master, unless the complainant will at once amend so as to state an offense triable by the Lodge. II the objection is not sustained, then the accused must plead thereto in such time as the Master shall prescribe, which shall be at once, unless for good reasons the time is extended. If there is objection to more than one charge, a sep - arate vote shall be taken on each. 1 429 Conir or THE GRAND LODGir. SEC. 285. Same.—It is to be seen by the foregoing section that in the “objection,” as filed or recorded, no reason or facts need be stated why the charge or charges do not state an offense, but in argument, for the information of the Lodge, any facts or reasons may be stated, urged and considered. It being the intent ion that no technicalities not going to the merits of the case shall avail either the Lodge or the accused as against the other, but by merely “objecting” any substantial defect in a charge may be urged. And again, that no charge shall be held defective or in - sufficient because indefinite in statement as to time or place, or other matters, where on its face it is sufficient to apprise the accused of the true nature of the offense, and serve as a guide in the production of proofs, and the imposition of penalties in case of conviction. SEc. 286. Same.—Nothing in this Code shall be construed to prevent any member of the Lodge from “objecting” to the sufficiency of charges, and having the same determined, or from submitting a motion amending the charges, or from preferring new charges, whereupon a trial may be had. SEC. 287. Plea.—Any charge to which there is not an “objection” (see Sections 283 and 285) or to which an objection is not sustained must be answered by"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.Ntichti ngargus.nl w.sttchtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus. ni xv.stichtingargus.nI xv.stichtingargus.nt w. stichtingargus. n I xv. stichtingargus. n I xv. stichtingargus.

It must be either “guilty” or “not guilty.” Under a plea of “not guilty,” the accused may, in addition to other defenses, prove that he has before been convicted or acquitted of the same offense by some Masonic Lodge; but no proof of such conviction or acquittal shall be suf - ficient except the original record or a certified tran - script of the proceedings in which such conviction or acquittal was had, if the record is in existence and obtainable. If such record is not obtainable, then other proof thereof may be given. Proof of a former conviction or acquittal for the same offense shall bar further proceedings as to such offense. Upon a plea of “guilty~” punishment only is to fol - low. (See Article 146 of the Constitution.) SEC. 288 Issue—Trial.—(a) There shall be no Lodge trial of any charge or charges, nor shall any trial commission be appointed in relation to such charge or charges, until a fter the provisions of Sections 279-287 shall have first been com - plied with and all objections filed shall have been decided and issue shall have been taken on the said charge or charges by a plea of “not guilty” entered thereon by the accused, or by the Master as hereinbefore provided (b) When issue has been taken on the charge or charges and is to be tried by the Lodge, the Master shall order a special meeting of the Lodge for the purpose of trying the issues so joined, and he shall give notice thereof to the Grand Master, stating in such notice whether it is desired that a Chancellor be assigned by the Grand Master to attend the trial.

(d) When the Grand Master has received a request from a Lodge or the Master thereof that it desires a trial by Com - mission of a charge or charges pending before it on which issue has been taken by a plea of “not guilty” entered thereon by the accused, or by the Master as hereinbefore provided, the Grand Master shall appoint five (5) Past Masters of other Lodges to serve as the Trial Commission in the case, one of whom the Grand Master shall designate as Chairman, who shall perform the duties generally incumbent upon the Worshipful Master in cases of trial in open Lodge.

The undersigned having been appointed to take testimony in the above ent,iied cause, gave notice to Brother ...~. who is prosecutor for the Lodge. and also to the accused (or his counsel) Brother ..... of the time and place for taking the s,ime. And now at such time and place, namely, the office ofC,D.. Req.. at S.C., this day of Brother appears for the Lodge, and the accused for himself (or the accused hy his counsel. Brother State the facts as they are, if no appearance, so state). Whereupon we proceeded to the taking of the testimony. Brother E.

When the prosecutor rinses, then give questions and answers by accused, or his counsel, or say, no examination by accused (Then) ExaminatIon resumed hy prosecuwr, etc. Then W. B., Esq., a profane, was produced hy the Lodge, and being dniy sworn, was examined and testified as follows: (Pursue same course.) When the prosecution ceases, then take the same course as to witnesses for the accused, showing always which party calls them. The party calling a witness shall first examine, and then the other, and in so doing he is not limited to a c7oss-e.romissalson, but may elicit any inlormation he desires which is ma - terial. (See Section 297.) Either party may resume the examination at the pleasure of the committee, having in view the pur - poses of the testimony. SEc. 299. Objections—Evidence.—Either party may at any time object to any question or answer, stating the grounds of the objection, and the chairman shall sustain or overrule the objection, keeping in mind that in cases of doubt it is safer to admit than to exclude, because, if improper, the testimony may afterwards be disregarded, but if excluded wrong - fully, it may necessitate taking testimony again. This admonition, however, should not lead the committee to too great liberality and burden the record with clearly improper testimony. (The questions and answers objected to and the rulings thereon should be written down in the min - utes, but no exceptions are necessary to have it reviewed on appeal.) (See Section 317.) SEC. 300.

The foregoing Ii all the testimony taken, ajid the record thereof shows all the rulings of the committee on the ohiec. tions or questions presented, and the same Is fraternally sub. mitted. Committee. SEC. 301. Exclude Testimony.—If improper testi - mony is allowed by the committee, either party may ask on the trial to have it exciuded (by which is meant not considered), and such question must be decided by the Master. After making the request, counsel may suggest any reasons they have for or against it. When informed, the Master should say: ‘The request is granted” or “refused,” as he may judge proper. Szc. 302. Record.—If. any part of the testimony is “exciuded,” there should be no erasure of testimony, but the record of the proceedings should show the action taken, and the testimony excluded should not be read or considered on the trial. SEC. 303 Trial.—When the Lodge is convened for the purpose of the trial, it shall be opened on the highest degree to which the accused has attained No oath, promise or pledge is necessary to qualify the members to act as a trial Lodge, the covenants of a Master Mason being a sufficient guaranty for every needful purpose The Lodge shall then proceed to take or complete the testimony, unless already completed before a committee appointed for that purpose. The testimony taken by committees shall be read to the Lodge when the prosecutor and the accused, or his counsel, shall be heard if they so desire, the prosecutor having the right to open and close the argument. The Lodge may limit the time for such argument by each. Szc. 304. Same-Who Present.—It is the duty of every member present at the first meeting to be 487 CODE oi ‘rex GRAND LODGE. present at the other meetings of the trial; but, if for any cause all are not able to do so, that fact is to be noted in the record and the trial continued. No member who has not been present during the entire trial shall be permitted to vote or take part in the proceedings, and after the commencement of the trial no person shall be admitted to the Lodge (except the accused or his counsel) unless by con - sent of the accused or his counsel and the prosecutor for the Lodge. SEC. 305. Same—Excused from Attending—When.— No member of a Lodge authorized to vote shall be excused from the Lodge by the Master except for sickness of himself or a member of his family, or a like pressing necessity. A mere temporary absence, during which the trial may be suspended, is not an excuse within the meaning of this section, it being the intention that all who vote (except by consent) shall witness the entire trial, and that each member shall assume the responsibility of action in such important concerns. (The taking of testimony before a committee is not for the purpose of this section, a part of the trial.) Sec. 306. Deliberatlon.—When the case is ready for deliberation and decision by the Lodge, the accused and his counsel and the accuser and his counsel (this does not app!y to the Junior Warden) shall retire, when the Lodge, if not already so, must be opened on the Master Mason Degree. In their delibera - tions the members may speak and seek information of the Worshipful Master. SEC. 307. Voting—After due deliberation, in the judgment of the Master, he shall submit to the Lodge this question as to each charge under investi - gation: “Is the accused guilty or not guilty?” The question shall be decided by ballot, and if two-"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargu~.ui I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stlChtlngargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w, ~t i c ha ngargus. ni w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nI xv. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus. ni xv. stichtingargus. ni w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichti ngarg us. n I w. stichtingargus. iii w. stichti ngargus.

ENery member present is bound to vote, unless excused by unanimous consent. SEc. 308. Punishment.—(SeC Article 146 of the Con - stitution.) SEc. 309. Exceptions.—No exceptions need be taken by the accused to any ruling or other proceedings connected with the trial in order to protect his rights on appeal, and on appeal the entire record may be reviewed, and on such review, eacept where there is a substantial prejudice to the rights of the ac - cused, all technicalities, errors and illegalities are to be disregarded, both as to form and substance of the proceedings. SEC. 310. Appeal. — In proceedings upon charges of unmasonic conduct no appeal lies to the Subordinate Lodge from the decision of the Master, and none to the Grand Lodge, except by the accused. (This applies to trials by Lodges Article 147-A of the Constitution provides for appeals from the actions of Trial Commissions) SEC. 311. Esoteric.—ln the event that the produc - tion of testimony should disclose any part of the esoteric (unwr.tten) work of Freemasonry, the Lodge or the committee shall omit the same from the written record of the case, and the same, if used, must be given orally at the trial. If, on appeal to the Grand Lodge. such testimony shall become material, any brother who heard the testimony on the trial below may be a witness before the Grand Lodge or its committee as to what such testimony was, but in no case can it be reduced to writing. SEC. 312. Acquittal.—If there is not a conviction the record should so state, with the addition: “The ac - cused is acquitted of the offense (or offenses) charged.” (It is advisable and important that a trial should CODE OF THE GaA~n LODGE. 489 be concluded at one meeting, as at a second it might be impossible to secure exactly the same attendance; but in cases where this cannot be done the Lodge may be closed to meet at another time, but should be at the earliest practicable date. Observe that the Lodge must be dosed, and not mei ely “coiled off,” or to “refreshment,” until another date. Of course, as many meetings as are necessary to com - plete the trial are by law allowed.) SEC. 313. Offense in Open Lodge—In any case where an oflense is committed in open Lodge. no for - mal charge or service of notice shall be necessary to give the Lodge jurisdiction, but jurisdiction at once attaches; and the facts constituting the offense shall be briefly stated by the Secretary in the proceedings, by order of the Master, as that Brother appeared in open Lodge in a state of intoxication, or in open Lodge used profane language. The Master shall thereupon direct the brother to show cause forthwith why he should not be punished for such conduct. If no showing is made, the Lodge shall proceed to punish. If a showing is made (for which purpose the accused may make his oral explanation, together with any othei showing he may have, either to eKcuse or mitigate it) the Master shall then in’ quire: “Brethren, is the brother excused?” The answer shall be by ballot, as directed in Article 146 of the Constitution. If excused, no further pro - ceediags shall be had. If not excused, punishment shall be imposed. Before taking such vote, the brother shall be required to retire to the Tiler’s room. SEc. 314. Same—If a punishment is to be imposed under the foregoing section, the same methods and rules shall obtain in fixing the punishment and its application as are provided in Article 146 of the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus. nt w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl xv.stichtingargus.nl xv. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl W.

Constitution, but the summary method prescribed in the foregoing section shall not be resorted to unless it be at the same meeting where the offense was committed. The neglect to thus proceed, how - ever, will not bar charges in the ordinary manner Sec. 315. Judgment.—In all cases of conviction and punishment by a Subordinate Lodge, the judgment shall be in force until reversed, set aside or modi - fied by the Grand Lodge; and if no appeal and no action is taken by the Grand Lodge at its next annual communication, then the judgment of the Subordinate Lodge shall stand affirmed: Provided, however, That it is always the right of the Grand Lodge to review and correct such proceedings in the absence of an appeal. Si~c. 316. Punishment.—Only one punishment can be imposed under one charge or one set of charges; that is, where there is a conviction on two or more charges in the same set of charges, the members in voting a punishment must have in view one ade - quate to all the offenses for which there is a con - viction. !‘Jeither can a Lodge, unless ordered by the Grand Lodge, reconsider its action, try a case and inflict a greater punishment. Where, however, the Grand Lodge orders a new trial, such trial is a trial de ,iovo, and the Lodge is in no way bound by the result of judgment in the original trial. CHAPTER XXVI. Of Appeals. SEC. 317. Appeal — Who May, and When. — In Masonic trials an appeal can only be taken by the brother who has been tried and convicted; on all other questions any brother interested therein may appeal to the Grand Lodge from the action of the Lodge, but in no case shall an appeal be taken cx- CODE OF THE Gaaxn LODGE. cept from the final action of the Lodge in the whole matter, it being the intention of this section to cic - press that in Masonry there are no interlocutory appeals. In an appeal the whole matter is brought up for review. SEc. 318. Same.—Where an appeal is taken written notice thereof must be filed by the appellant with the Secretary of the Lodge within thiity days after the rendition of the judgment. SEc. 319. Transcript for Grand Lodge.—Upon re - ceiving written notice of appeal the Secretary shall forthwith prepare and forward to the Grand Secre - tary a complete transcript of the proceedings, in - cluding the testimony.

SEc. 332. Neglecl.—The fact of whether or not the Subordinate Lodge has failed or neglected to enforce discipline, so as to give the Grand Lodge jurisdic - tion, is a question for the Grand Master, and his decision thereon is conclusive. In this respect he may adopt his own method of inquiry, first giving notice of the charges to the accused and the alleged delinquent Lodge, that they may be heard, and herein the Grand Master may exercise a broad discretion that the general interest of the Craft may be served. If the Grand Master shall decide that there has not been such neglect or failure, or if he shall be of the opinion that the charges, even though technically an offense, are not of sufficient importance to merit the action of the Grand Lodge, he may dismiss the same. SEc. 333. Notice to Accused.—If the Grand Master shall be of the opinion that there has been a neglect or failure to act on the part of the Subordinate Lodge, and that the charges are of such importance as to merit the action of the Grand Lodge. he sh.dl notify the accused of such conctusion, and furnish him a copy of the charges, and as to service of such notice and charges and in all other respects, the same proceedings are to be had. aiid with like effect, as provided in this chapter and in Chapter XXII. SEC. 334 Discipline in Grand Lodge.—In matters of discipline of members of the Grand Lodge for unmasonic conduct during a communication of the Grand Lodge, whether during hours of labor or refreshment, it may pro - ceed to try and punish the same in a summary manner and at its discretion. Sec. 335. Restoration or Reinstatement by Grand Lodge.—ln cases where the Grand Lodge has 449 CODE OF THE GRAND LODGE original jurisdiction, and a Mason is suspended or expelled, it shall be from all the rights arid privileges of Masonry, unless otherwise expressed; and in such cases reinstatement must be by petition to the Grand Lodge, and shall be by a two-thirds vote thereof. A Mason thus reinstated is not to membership in any particular Lodge of the Jurisdiction, but has the standing of a demitted Mason, except that in the case of an Entered Apprentice or Fellow Craft, the reinstatement shall be to the rank and Lodge relationship he held before expulsion or sus - pension SEC. 336. Rehearing.—After final disposition of any matter pending in the Grand Lodge on appeal, or in which the jurisdiction was original, a hearing may be granted upon application therefor by a party thereto, if such show - ing shall be made that the Grand Lodge believes such rehearing to be in the interest of justice.

They have always been held in the highest veneration by tbe fraternity, as embodying the most Important imints of tbe ancient twitte,~. as well *8 unwritten, lava of Mamfy. APPENDIX 455 I. CONCERNING GOD AND RXLIG!ON. A Mason is obliged, by his tenure, to obey the moral law, and if he rightly understands the art, he will never be a stupid atheist nor an irreligious lib - ertine. But though in ancient times Masons were charged in every country to be of the religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, it is now thought more expedient only to oblige them 10 that religion in which all men agree, leaving their par - ticular opinions to themselves; that is, to be good men and true, or men of honour and honcsty, by whatever denominations or persuasions they may be distinguished whereby Masonry becomes the center of union, and the means ol conciliating true friend - ship among persons that must have remained at a perpetual distance. II. Oi’ THE CIVIL MAGTSTRATIt, Supn~r~ AND SUB0RDINATZ. A Mason is a peaceable subject to the civil powers wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in plots and conspirades against the peace and welfare of the nation, nor to behave himself un - dutifully to inferior magistrates; for as Masonry hath always been injured by war, bloodshed, and con - fusion, so ancient kings and princes have been much disposed to encourage the craftsmen, because of their peaceableness and loyalty, whereby they prac - tically answered the cavits of Iheir adversaries, and prompted the honor of the fraternity, who ever flourished in times of peace. So that if a brother should be a rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanced in his rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man; and, if convicted of no oiher crime, though the loyal brotherhood must and ought to disown his rebellion, and give no umbrage"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargu~u I w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus ni w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus. ni w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.sttchtingargus.nl w.xtlchtiflgargus.nl w.sttchtingargus.nl w sichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus nI w. stichtingargus . n I w. stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingargus. lii w. stichtingargus. fli stichtingarguN. iti w.stichti ngargilN, Id w. stichtingal’gu~, Ill w.stichtingar 8 Ll~,Ia w.stichtingargut~.td w.stichti flgal’gIw 1 ld w.stichti ngargtir~ 1 rd w.stichtingat~~lu4 III w.stichtingar~tt~ Ill ¶ I 456 APPENDIX or ground of political jealousy to the government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his relation to it remains indefeasible. III. Ow Lonczs. A Lodge is a place where Masons assemble and work; hence that assembly, or duly organized society of Masons, is called a Lodge, and every brother ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its By-Laws and the general regulations. It is either particular or general, and will be best understood by attending it, and by the regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annexed. In ancient times, no Master or Fellow could be absent from it, es - pecially when warned to appear at it, without incur - ring a severe censure, until it appeared to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hindered him. The persons admitted members of a Lodge must be good and true men, free born, and of mature and discreet age, no bondmen, no women, no immoral or scandalous men, but of good report. IV. OF MAsvzas, WARDENS, FZLr,ows, AND APPEZWnCU. All preferment among Masons is grounded upon real worth and personal merit only; that so the lords may be well served, the brethren not put to shame, nor the Royal Craft despised. Therefore, no Master or Warden is chosen by seniority, but for his merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every brother must attend in his place, and learn them in the way peculiar to this fraternity: only candidates may know that no Master should tale an Apprentice unless he has sufficient employ - ment for him, and unless he be a perfect youth, hav - ing no maim or defect in his body, that may render him incapable of learning the art of serving his ‘F APPENDIX 457 Master’s LosD, and of being made a brother, and then a 1’ellow Craft in due time, even after he has served such a term of years as the custom of the country directs; and that he should be descended of honest parents; that so, when otherwise qualified, he may arrive at the honor of being the Warden, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Master of all the Lodges, according to his merit. No brother can be a Warden until’ he has passed the part of a Fellow Craft; nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand Warden until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor GRAND MAS’rER unless he has been a Fellow Craft before his elec - tion, who is also to be nobly born, or a gentleman of the best fashion, or some eminent scholar, or some curious architect, or other artist, descended of honest parents and who is of singular great merit in the opinion of the Lodges. And for the better and easier and more honorable discharge of his office, the Grand Master has a power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular Lodge, and has the privilege of acting whatever the Grand Master, his principal, should act, unless the said principal be present, or interpose his authority by a letter. These rulers and governors, supreme and subor - dinate, of the ancient Lodge, are to be obeyed in their respective stations by all the brethren, according to the Old Charges and regulations, with all humility, reverence, love and alacrity."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stlchtlngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus. ni w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w,xtichti ngargus.nl w.stchtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus . n I w.stichtingargus. ol w. stichtingargus. ol w.stichtingargus. ni w. stichtingarguN. ol w.stichti ngargLl~, Ill w. stichti ngargllN,l)t w.stichti flgal’gIlNJtI w.stichti ngLlrgtlh]1I w.stichtingargtt~ Ill ¶ 458 APPENDIX V. Or 1H5 MANAGEMENT or THE CiA?? IN WouUNG, All Masons shall work honestly on working days, that they may live creditably on holy days, and the time appointed by the law of the land, or confirmed by custom, shall be observed. The most expert of the Fellow Craftsmen shall be chosen or appointed the Master, or Overseer, of the lord’s work; who is to be called Master by those that work under him. The Craftsmen are to avoid all ill language, and to call each other by no disobliging name but brother or fellow; and to behave themselves courteously within and without the Lodge. The Master, knowing himself to be able of cunning, shall undertake the lord’s work as reasonably as pos - sible, and truly dispend his goods as if they were his own; nor to give more wages to any brother or ap - prentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons, receiving their wages justly, shall be faithful to the lord, and hon - estly finish their work, whether task or journey; nor put the work to task that hath been accustomed to journey. None shall discover envy at the prosperity of a brother, nor supplant him, or put him out of his work, if he be capahle to finish the same; for no man can finish an - other’s work so much to the lord’s profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the designs and draughts of him that began it. When a Fellow-Craftsman is chosen Warden of the work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and fellows, shall carefully oversee the work in the Master’s absence to the lord’s profit, and his brethren shall obey him. All Masons employed shall meekly receive their wages without murmuring or mutiny, and not desert the Master till the work is finished. APPENDIX 459 A younger brother shall be instructed in working, to prevent spoiling the materials for want of judg - ment, and for increasing and continuing of brotherly love. All the tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge. No laborer shall be employed in the proper work of Masonry; nor shall Freemasons work with those that are not free, without an urgent necessity; nor shall they teach laborers and unaccepted Masons, as they should teach a brother or fellow. VI. Or BEHAvioR, Viz.: 1. In the Lodge While Constituted. You are not to hold private committees, or separate conversation, without leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinent or unseemly, nor in - terrupt the Master or Wardens, or any brother speaking to the Master; nor behave yourself ludi - crously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn; nor use any unbecoming language upon any pretense whatsoever; but to pay due reverence to your Master, Wai dens, and Fellows, and put them to worship. If any complaint be brought, the brother found guilty shall stand to the award and determination of the Lodge, who are the proper aiid competent judges of all such controversies (unless you carry it by ap - peal to the Grand Lodge). and to whom they ought to be relerred. unless a lord’s work be hindered the meanwhile, in which case a particular reference may be made; but you must never go to law about what concerneth Masonry, without an absolute necessity ap - parent to the Lodge."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus. lit w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus. ni w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl wstichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichfingargus.nl w.stichtingargusnl w.stichtingargus.nl W~xt lChti ngargus.nl wstlchtingargus.nI w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus . n I w. stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .

Behavior After ihe Lodge is Over and the Brethren Not Gone. You may enjoy yourselves with innocent mirth, treat - ing one another according to ability, but avoiding all excess, or forcing any brother to eat or drink beyond his inclination, or hindering him from going when his occasions call him, or doing or saying anything offen - sive, or that may forbid an easy and free conversa - tion; for that would blast our harmony and defeat our laudable purposes. Therefore, no private piques or quarrels must be brought within the door of the Lodge, far less quarrels about religion, or nations, or state policy, we being only, as Masons, of the catholic reli - gion above mentioned; we are also of all nations, tongues, kindreds, and languages, and are resolved against all politics, as what never yet conducted to the welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This charge has been always strictly enjoined and observed; but espe - cially ever since the Reformation in Britain, or the dis - sent and secession of these nations from the commun - ion of Rome. 3. Behavior When Brethren Meet Without Strangers. But Not in a Lodge Formed. You are to salute one another in a courteous manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freely giving mutual instruction as shall be thought expedient, without being overseen or overheard, and without encroaching upon each other, or derogating from that i espect which is due to any brother, were he not a Mason; for, though all Masons are as brethren upon the same level, yet Masonry takes no honor from a man that he had before; nay, rather it adds to his honor, especially if he has deserved well of the brother - hood, who must give honor to whom it is due, and avoid ill manners. APPENDIX 461 4, Behavior in Presence of Strangers Not Masons. You shall be cautious in your words and carriage, that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and sometimes you shall divert a discourse, and man - age it prudently for the honor of the Worshipful Fra. ternity. 5. Behavior at Home, and in Your Neighborhood. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise man; particularly, not to let your family, friends, and neigh - bors know the concerns of the Lodge, etc., but wisely to consult your own honor, and that of the Ancient Brotherhood, for reasons not to be mentioned here. You must also consult your health by not continuing together too late, or too long from home, after Lodge hours are past; and by avoiding of gluttony or drunk - enness, that your families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working. 6. Behavior Toward a Strange Brother. You are cautiously to examine him, in such a method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant false pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and derision, and beware of giving him any hints of knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be relieved; you must employ him some days, or else recommend him to be employed.

And if any of them do you injury, you must apply to your own Lodge, and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge at the quar - terly communication, and from thence to the annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable conduct of our forefathers in every nation; never taking a legal course; hut when the case cannot be otherwise decided, and patiently listening to the honest and friendly advice of Master and fellows when they would prevent you going to law with strangers, or would eiccite you to put a speedy period to all law suits, that so you may mind the affair of Maaonry with the more alacrity and suc - cess; but with respect to brothers or fellows at law, Ihe Master and brethren should kindly offer their medi - ation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by Ihe contending brethren; and if that submission is impracticable, they must, however, carry on their proc - ess or law suit without wrath and rancor (not in the common way), saying or doing nothing which may hinder brotherly love, and good offices to be renewed and continued, that all may see the benign influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the begin - ning of the world and will do to the end of time. Amen. So mote it be. r APPENDIX. 463 ill’ GENERAL REGULATIONS,* Compiled first by Mr. GEORGE PAYNE, A. D. 1720. when he was Grand Master, and approved by the Grand Lodge on St. John the Baptist’s Day, A. D. 1721, at Stationer’s Hall, London; when the Most Noble Prince JOHN, Duke of Montagu, was unanimously chosen our Grand Master for the year ensuing; who chose JOHN BEAL, M. D, his Deputy Grand Master; Mr. JosIAH VILLENEAU and ML THOMAS MORRIS, JR., were chosen by the Lodge Grand Wardens, and now, by the com - mand of our said Right Woishiplul Grand Master MONTACU, the author of this book, has compared them with, and reduced them to the ancient records and immemorial usages of the fraternity, and digested them into this new method, with several proper explications, for the use of the Lodges in and about London and stminster. We I. The Grand Master, or his Deputy, hath authority and right not only to be present in any true Lodge, but also to preside wherever he is, with the Master of the Lodge on his left hand, and to order his Grand Wardens to attend him, who are not to act in particu - lar Lodges as Wardens, but in his presence and at hia command, because there the Grand Master may com - mand the Wardens of that Lodge, or any other breth - ren he pleaseth, to attend and act as his Wardens pro tern pore.

The Master of a particular Lodge has the right and authority of congregating the members of his Lodge into a Chapter at pleasure, upon any emergency or occurrence as well as to appoint the time and place of their usual forming; and in case of sickness, death, or necessary absence of the Master, the Senior War - den shall act as Master pro fern pore, ii no brother is preaent who has been Master of that Lodge before; for in that case the absent Master’s authority reverts to the last Master then present; though he cannot act until the said Senior Warden has once congregated thr Lodge, or, in his absence, the Junior Warden. IlL The Master of each particular Lodge, or one of the Wardens, or some other brother by his order, shall leep a book containing their By-Laws, the names of their members, with a list of all the Lodges in town, and the usual times and places of their forming, and all their transactions that are proper to be written. IV. No Lodge shall make more than five new breth - ren at one time, nor any man under the age of twenty- five, who must be also his own master; unless by a dis - pensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy. V. No man can be made or admitted a member of a particular Lodge without previous notice one month before given to the said Lodge, in order to make due inquiry into the reputation and capacity of the candi - date, unless by the dispensation aforesaid. VI. But no man can be entered a brother in any par - ticular Lodge, or admitted to a member thereof, with - out the unanimous consent of all the members of that Lodge then present when the candidate is proposed, and their consent is formally asked by the Master; and they are to signify their consent or dissent in their own prudent way, either virtually or in form, but with unanimity; nor is this inherent privilcge subject to a dispensation, because the members of a particular Lodge APPENDIX 465 are the best judges of it; and if a fractious member should be impoaed on them, it might spoil their har - mony or hinder their freedom, or even break or disperse the Lodge, which ought to be avoided by all good and true brethren. VII. Every new brother at his making is decently to clothe the Lodge, that is, all the brethren present, and to deposit something for the relief of indigent and decayed brethren, as the candidate shall think fit to bestow, over and above the small allowance stated by the By-Laws of that particular Lodge, which charity shall be lodged with the Master or Wardens, or the cashier, if the members think fit to choose one. And the candidate shall also solemnly promise to submit to the Constitutions, the Charges, and Regula - tions, and to such other good usages as shall be inti - mated to him in time and place convenient. VIII. No set or number of brethren shall withdraw or separate themselves from the Lodge in which they were made brethren, or were afterward admitted mem - bers, unless the Lodge becomes too numerous; nor even then, without a dispensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy; and when they are thus scparated, they must either immediately join themselves to such other Lodge as they shall like best, with the unanimous con - Ccnt of that other Lodge to which they go (as above regulated), or else they must obtain the Grand Ivias - ter’s warrant to join in forming a new Lodge. If any set or number of Masons shall take upon thcmselves to form a Lodge without the Grand Mas - ter’s warrant, the regular Lodges are not to counte - nance them, nor own them as fair brethren and duly formed, nor approve ol their acts and deeds, but must treat them as rebels, until they humble themselves, as the Grand Master shall in his prudence direct, and I"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus. lii w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. 01 w. stichtingargus .01 w.stichtingargus. ol w stichtingargu~•oI stlchtingargux.

IX. But if any brother so far misbehaves himself as to render his Lodge uneasy, he shall be twice duly admonished by the Master or Wardens in a formed Lodge; and if he will not refrain his imprudence, and obediently submit to the advice ol the brethien, and reform what gives them offense, he shall be dealt with according to the By-Laws of that particular Lodge, or else in such a manner as the quarterly communication shall in their great prudence think fit, for which a new regulation may be afterward made. X. The majority of every particular Lodge, when congregated, shall have the privilege of giving instruc - tions to their Master and Wardens, before the assem - bling of the Grand Chapter, or Lodge, at the three quarterly communications hereafter mentioned, and of the annual Grand Lodge, too, because their Masters and Wardens are their representatives, and are sup - posed to speak their mind. Xl. All particular Lodges are to observe the same usages as much as possible, in order to which, and for cultivating a good ui~derstanding among Freemasons, some members out of every Lodge shall be deputed to visit the other Lodges as often as shall be thought con - venient. XII. The Grand Lodge consists of, and is formed by, the Masters and Wardens of all the regular particular Lodges upon record, with the Grand Master at their head, and his Deputy on his left hand, and the Grand Wardens in their proper places, and must have a quar - terly communication about Michaelmas, Christmas, and APPENDiX 467 Lady Day, in some convenient place, as the Grand Mas - ter shall appoint, where no brother shall be present who is not at that time a member thereol, without a dispen - sation, and while he stays, he shall not be allowed to vote, nor even give his opinion, without leave of the Grand Lodge asked and given, or unless it be duly asked by the said Lodge. All matters are to be determined in the Grand Lodge by a majority of votes, each member having one vote, and the Grand Master having two votes, unless the said Lodge leave any particular thing to the determination of the Grand Master for the sake of expedition. XIII. At the said quarterly communication, all mat - ters that concern the fraternity in general, or particular Lodges, or single brethren, are quietly, sedately and maturely to be discoursed of and transacted. Appren - tices must be admitted Masters and Fellow Craft only here, unless by a dispensation. Here also all differ - ences that cannot be made up and accommodated pri - vately, or by a particular Lodge, are to be seriously considered and decided; and if any brother thinks him - self agrieved by the decision of this board, he may appeal to the annual Grand Lodge next ensuing, and leave his appeal in writing with the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or the Grand Wardens. Here also the Master or the Wardens of each par - ticular Lodge shall bring and produce a list of such mcmbers as have been made, or even admitted in their particular Lodges since the last communication of the Grand Lodge; and there shall be a book kept by the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or, rather, by some brother whom the Grand Lodge shall appoint for Sec - retary, wherein shall be recorded all the Lodges, with their usual times and places of forming, and the names"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"w.stichtingargus•ii I w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI W.stlchtlngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.xtlchtingargus.nl W. stlchtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nI w.stichtingargus. n I w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingarg us, n I w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingargu~. ol w. stichtingargu~at I w. stichtingargu~. ot w.stichtingargLl~, 01 w. stichtingar~ui~,ll I w.stichtingar~uN,nI w.stichtingargtitui I w.stichtingargu~ui I w. stichti nga 113 LlNdl I w. stichti nga r~ii~-ut I w.stichtingar~u~ id w.stichtingar~ti~ iii ¶ K I 468 APPENDIX of all the members of each Lodge, and all the affairs of the Grand Lodge that are proper to be written. They shall also consider of the most prudent and effectual methods of collecting and disposing of what money shall be given to, or lodged with them in char - ity, toward the relief only of any true brother fallen into poverty or decay, but of none else; but every par - ticular Lodge shall dispose of their own charity for poor brethren according to their own By-Laws until it be agreed by all the Lodges (in a new reguldtioii) to carry in the charity collected by them to the Grand Lodge at the quarterly or annual communication, in order to make a common stock of it, for the more hand - some relief of poor brethren. They shall also appoint a Treasurer, a brother of good worldly subatance, who shall be a member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his office, and shall be always present, and have power to move to the Grand Lodge anything, especially what concerns his office. To him shall be committed all money raised for charity, or for any other use o~ the Grand Lodge, which he shall write down in a book, with the respective ends and uses for which the several sums are intended; and shall expend and disburse the same by such a certain order, signed as the Grand Lodge shall afterward agree to in a new regulation; but he shall not vote in choosing a Grand Master or Wardens, though in every other transaction. As in like manner the Secretary shall be a member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his office, and vote in everything except in choosing a Grand Master or War - dens. The Treasurer and Secretary shall have each a clerk, who must be a brother and Fellow Craft, but never must be a member ol the Grand Lodge, nor speak with - out being allowed or desired. APPENDIX 469 The Grand Master or his Deputy, shall always coin - mand the Treasurer and Secretary, with their clerks and books, in order to see bow matters go on, and to know what is expedient to be done upon any emergent occasion. Another brother (who must be a Fellow Craft) should be appointed to look after the door of the Grand Lodge; but shall be no member of it. But these offices may be further explained by a new regulation, when the necessity and expediency of them may more appear than at present to the fra - ternity. XIV. if at any Grand Lodge, stated or occasional, quarterly or annual, the Grand Master and his Deputy should be both absent, then the present Master of a Lodge that has been the longest a Freemason shall take the chair and preside as Grand Master pro tern pore, and shall be vested with all his power and honor for the time; provided there is no other pres - ent that has been Grand Master formerly, or Deputy Grand Master; for the last Grand Master present, or else the last Deputy present, should always of right take place in the absence of the present Grand Master and his Deputy. XV. In the Grand Lodge none can act as Wardens but the Grand Wardens themselves, if present; and if absent, the Grand Master, or the person who pre - sides in his place, shall order private Wardens to act as Grand Wardens pro tern pore, whose places are to be supplied by two Fellow Crafts of the same Lodge, called forth to act, or sent thither by the particular Master thereof; or if by him omitted, then they shall be called by the Grand Master, that so the Grand Lodge may be always complete.

The Grand Master shall receive no intimation of business concerning Masonry but from his Deputy first. cEcept in certain cases as his Worship can well judge of; for if the application to the Grand Mas - ter be irregular, he can easily order the Grand War - dens, or any other brethren thus applying, to wait upon his Deputy, who is to prepare the business speedily, and to lay it orderly before his Worship. XVII. No Grand Master. Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wardens, Treasurer, Secretary, or whoever acts for them, or in their stead pro tern pore, can at the same time be the Master or Warden of a particu - lar Lodge; but as soon as ~ny of them has honor - ably discharged his Grand Office, he returns to that post or station in his particular Lodge from which he was called to officiate above. XVIIl. If the Deputy Grand Master be sick, or necessarily absent, the Grand Master may choose any Fellow Craft he please to be his Deputy pro tern pore; but he that is chosen Deputy at the Grand Lodge, and the Grand Wardens, too, cannot be discharged without the cause fairly appear to the malority of the Grand Lodge; and the Grand Master, if he is uneasy, may call a Grand Lodge on purpose to lay the cause before them, and to have their advice and concurrence, in which case the majority of the Grand Lodge, if they cannot reconcile the Master and his APPENDIX 471 Deputy or his Wardens, are to concur in allowing the Master to discharge his said Deputy or his said Wardens, and to choose another Deputy imme - diately; and the said Grand Lodge shall choose other Wardens in that case, that harmony and peace may be preserved. XIX If the Grand Master should abuse his power, and render himself unworthy of the obedience and subjection of the Lodges, he shall be treated in a way and manner to be agreed upon in a new regu - lation; because hitherto the ancient fraternity have had no occasion for it, their former Grand Masters having all behaved themselves as worthy of that honorahle office. XX. The Grand Master, with his Deputy and War - dens, shall (at least once) go round and visit all the Lodges about town during his Mastership. XXI. If the Grand Master die during his Master. ship, or by sickness, or by being beyond sea, or any other way should be rendered incapable of discharg - ing his office, the Deputy, or, in his absence, the Senior Grand Warden, or, in his absence, the Junior, or, in his absence, any three present Masters of Lodges, shall join to congregate the Grand Lodge immediately to advise together upon that emer - gency and to send two of their number to invite the last Grand Master to resume office, which now in course reverts to him; or, if he refuse, then the next last, and so backward. But if no former Grand Master can be found, then the Deputy shall act as principal until another is chosen, or if there be no Deputy, then the oldest Master. XX II.

XXIII. If it be thought expedient, and the Grand Master, with the majority ot the Masters and War - dens, agree to hold a grand feast according to the ancient laudahle custom of Masons, then the Grand Wardens shall have the care of preparing the tickets, sealed with the Grand Master’s seal, of disposing of the tickets, of receiving the money for the tickets, of buying the materials of the feast, of finding out a proper and convenient place to feast in, and of every other thing that concerns the entertainment. But, that the work may not be too burdensome to the two Grand Wardens, and that all matters may be expeditiously and safely managed, the Grand Mas - ter, or his Deputy, shall have power to nominate and appoint a certain number of Stewards, as his Worship shall think fit, to act in concert with the two Grand Wardens; all things relating to the feast being decided among them by a majority of voices, except the Grand Master or his Deputy interpose by a particular directioii or appointment. I APPENDIX 473 XXIV. The Wardens and Stewards shall, in due time, wait upon the Grand Master, or his Deputy, for directions and orders about the premises; but if his Worship and his Deputy are sick, or necessarily absent, they shall call together the Masters and Wardens of Lodges to meet on purpose for their advice and orders; or else they may take the matter wholly upon themselves and do the best they can. The Grand Wardens and the Stewards are to account for all the money they receive or expend, to the Grand Lodge, after dinner, or when the Grand Lodge shall think fit to receive their accounts. If the Grand Master pleases, he may in due time summon all the Masters and Wardens of Lodges, to consult with them about ordering the grand feast, and about any emergency or accidental thing relat - ing thereto, that may require advice; or else to take it upon himself altogether. XXV. The Masters of Lodges shall each appoint one experienced and discreet Fellow Craft of his Lodge, to compose a committee, consisting of one from every Lodge, who shall meet to receive, in a convenient apartment, every person that brings a ticket, and shall have power to discourse him, if they think fit, in order to admit him or debar him, as they shall see cause; provided, they send no man away before tney have acquainted all the brethren within doors with the reasons thereof, to avoid mis - takes; that so no true brother may be debarred, nor a false brother or mere pretender admitted. This committee must meet very early on St. John’s Day at the place, even before any persons come with tickets. XXVI.

The Grand Wardens, or the Stewards, shall appoint beforehand such a number of brethren to serve at table as they think fit and proper for that work; and they may advise with the Masters and W,srdens of Lodges about the most proper persons, if they please, or may take in such by their recom - mendation; for none are to serve that day but Free and Accepled Masons, that the commurucations may be free and harmonious. XXVIlI. All the members of the Grand Lodge must be at the place long before dinner, with the Grand Master, or his Deputy, at their head, who shall retire and form themselves. And this done in order— 1. To receive any appeals duly lodged as above regulated, that the appellant may be heard, and the affair may be amicably decided before dinner, if pos - sible; but if it cannot, it must be delayed till after the new Grand Master is elected, and if it cannot be decided after dinner, it may be delayed and referred to a particular committee, that shall quietly adjust it. and make report to the next quarterly communi - cation, that brotherly love may be preserved. 2. To prevent any difference or disgust which may be feared to arise that day, that no interruption may be given to the harmony and pleasure of the Grand Feast. 3. To consult about whatever concerns the decency and decorum of the Grand Assembly, and to prevent all indecency and ill manners, the assembly being promiscuous. 4. To receive and consider of any good motion, or any momentous and important affair that shall be APPENDIX brought from the particular Lodges by their repre - sentatives, the several Masters and Wardens. XXIX. After these things are discussed, the Grand Master and his Deputy, the Grand Wardens, or the Stewards, the Secretary, the ‘I’reasurer, the Clerks, and every other person shall withdraw and leave the Masters and Wardens of the particular Lodges alone, in order to consult amicably about the electing a new Grand Master, or continuing the present, if they have not done it the day before; and if they are unanimous for continuing the present Grand Master, his Worship shall be called in, and humbly desired to do the fra - ternity the honor of ruling them for the year en - suing; and after dinner it will be known whether he accepts of it or not; for it should not be discovered but by the election itself. XXX. Then the Masters aud Wardens, and all the brethren. may converse promiscuously, or as they please to sort together, until the dinner is coming in, when every brother takes his seat at table. XXXI. Some time after dinner the Grand Lodge is formed, not in retirement, but in the presence of all the brethren who yet are not members of it, and must not, therefore, speak until they are desired or allowed.

APPENDIX 479 Iv ENCYCLICAL LETTER. ADDRESSED BY THE GRAND LODGE oF SOUTH CAROLINA TO THE SUBORDINATE LODGES UNDER HER JURiSDIcTIoN. Brethren: The Grand Lodge, anxious for your pros - perity, and desirous that, as members of the great mystic family, you should preserve in unfaded bright - ness the light of Masonry which has been entrusted to your keeping, addresses you, on the occasion of this Grand Communication, an encyclical letter of advice, of admonition and direction. In the first place, the Grand Lodge earnestly calls your attention to the subject of admission of mem - bers. Let your great anxiety be n~t to increase the number, but the respectability and worthiness of your candidates. The prerequisite qualifications of appli - cants for Masonry are of a threefold character. They are moral, mental, and physical. Every candidate for initiation into the mysteries of Freemasonry must be a man of good moral character, of irre - proachable reputation, and living, as our Ritual ex - presses it, “under the tongue of good report.” The Lodge which admits a member who has not these necessary qualifications, is bringing into our fold, not a lamb, the emblem of innocence and purity, but a ravenous wolf who will inevitably destroy the flock Neither is an ignorant or uneducated man desirable as a candidate for our mysteries. Without some in - tellectual culture, it is not likely that he will appre - ciate the symbolic character of our institution, nor would he be able to become a very useful or hon - orable member of the craft. Lastly, as to the physi - cal qualifications, the AlTMAN REZON leaves no doubt on the subject, but expressly declares that every"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"________________________________ — ——— I P11 w. stichtingargus.

This is one of the ancient Landmarks of the Order, which it is in the power of no body of men to change. A man having but one arm or one leg, or who is any way deprived of his due proportion of limbs and members, is as incapable of initiation as a woman. As to the religious qualifications, the action of some other Grand Lodges makes it ex - pedient that we should impress upon you that no other religious test is necessary or proper in the candidate except that he declare himself a firm be. liever in the eicistence of a Supreme Being. Finally, on this sublect, brethren, let it always be remembered that in balloting for a candidate each Lodge is not acting for itself alone, but for the wholt Order at large. It is not simply admitting a new asso - ciate into its own narrow circle, but is introducing a brother into the great Masonic family whose virtuous or vicious conduct will affect the institution in all parts of the world, for good or evil. Let no brother then forget that it is as sacred a duty to reject the worthless as it is to receive the worthy. The conduct of your members requires also con - stant supervision. A Mason must obey the moral law, and l,is conduct must be such as not only to do credit to himself, but reflect a portion of that credit upon the Lodge and the fraternity of which he is a part. The more faithful he is to his duties as a man, a citizen, and a neighbor, the more he will ex - alt the reputation of that institution of which he is a worthy member. But, on the contrary, if for - getful of the lessons of morality and virtue which are taught within the Lodge, he degrades himself by the constant practice of immorality, the degradation I APPENDIX falls not on him alone, but on all those who have given him the right hand of fellowship and hailed him as a brother. In a case like this the duty of the Lodge is plain. Let the erring brother be first kindly, but firmly, admonished of his fault Tf he repents and seeks amendment, let every aid be given to his new-formed resolutions; but if he continues in his course of vice, he must no longer be suffered to contaminate the purity of our institution by his presence, but, hue a diseased limb, must be cut off, lest it poison the whole body. Except in extreme cases of moral turpitude, it will be better to suspend for a given period, to allow the defaulter an opportunity of reclaiming himself; but when all hope of such a result is lost, he must be expelled from Masonry, and be no longer considered as a brother. When such a man, living in the open shamelessness and abandon - ment of vice, without exhibiting in his life one guid - ing principle of Masonry, still continues to retain his membership in a Lodge in this jurisdiction, or claims to be a Mason in its vicinity, the Grand Lodge will hold such a Lodge guilty of all the evil and dis - grace which Masonry in such a case must necessarily receive. On the suhiect of Masonic work, it is the desire of the Grand Lodge that as perfect uniformity as possi - ble should exist. Having adopted a system, which it has entrusted to an appropriate officer to communi - cate to you, it asks you to listen to and follow his instructions. As we are but one household, it is meet and proper that our labors, our Ritual, and all our ceremonies, should correspond, so that no brother in visiting a neighboring Lodge should feel himself a stranger, but may rather be convinced of the uni - formity, regularity, and beauty of our institution."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.ll I w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl W. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl W.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl W. stichtingargus.nl W.stlchtingargus.nl w. stlchtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargusnl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus. n I w. stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingarg us. n I w.stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingargus.

There is, brethren, no custom more pregnant with evil than this. It is far better to present a candidate with the degrees conferred than on his first entrance into the Order to burden him with a pecuniary obli - gation to the Lodge which it may be inconvenient for him to liquidate, and which in the infirmity of human nature will most probably affect injuriously the kind feelings which should exist among all the members. This custom the Grand Lodge most imperatively for. bids. It is expected of every Mason that he shall pay due reverence and respect to the supreme and subordinate rulers of Masonry who have been placed over him. The importance of the duty of obedience is too often and too strongly enforced in our ancient charges to require at this time any formal recapitulation. The Master of the Lodge and, under him, the Wardens have, it is to be supposed, been elected for their wis. - dom and prudence and skill in Masonry. To their awards every member should, then, quietly and re - spectiully submit. The authority of the Master, es - pecially, is supreme in the Lodge. For his errors he is alone accountable to the Grand Lodge; and as his obligations require that he should see the ancient Landmarks of Masonry and the rules and regulations of the Grand Lodge enforced and obeyed, it is but proper that he should be invested with the power to carry out these obligations. Hence the decrees of the Master must always be respected by the members of the Lodge. He may, and of course will, sometimes be wrong, for “to err is human,” but in all such cases an appeal from his decision may be taken to the Grand Lodge, who will ever be ready to correct his errors and impartially to administer justice. APPENDIX Finally, brethren, among yourselves eschew all strife and quarrels. Living in peace with all the world, live in love with each other. Thus shall you assist in the elevation and prosperity of our beloved institution and secure to yourselves the greatest of all blessings, “a conscience void of offense.” And may the Supreme Grand Architect of the Universe ever have you in his holy keeping; may brotherly love prevail, and every moral and social virtue cement you in the bonds of peace and friend - ship. By order of the Grand Lodge. ALBERT G. MACKEY, M. D., Grand Secretary. DECLARATION OF MASONIC PRINCIPLES (Adopted 1939) Freemasonry is a charitable, benevolent, educational and religious society. Its principles are proclaimed as widely as men will hear. Its only secrets are in its methods of recognition and of symbolic instruction. It is charitable in that it is not organized for profit and none of its income inures to the benefit of any in - dividual, but all is devoted to the promotiov of the welfare and happiness of mankind. It is benevolent in that it teaches and exemplifies altruism as a duty. It is educational in that it teaches by prescribed ceremonials a system of morality and brotherhood based upon the Sacred Law. It is religious in that it teaches monotheism, the Volume of the Sacred Law is open upon its altars whenever a Lodge is in session, reverence for God is ever present in its ceremonial, and to its Brethren"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"w. stichtingargus.n w.stichtingargus .nhl w. stichtingargus .n1~ w. stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl W. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl W.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl W. stichtingargus.nl W.stlchtingargus.nl w. stlchtingargus.nl w stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus. ni w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus. iii w.stichtingargus, ~iI w. stichtingargu~~ Ill w.stichtingarguN, I)! w. stichtingargtl~~i.aA w.stichtingarguh, ut w. stichtingarguw~ I w. stichtingargluN, iii w.stichtingarguN 1 lll w. stichtingargun~tiI w.stichtingargtlh. iii ¶ __I 484 APPENDIX are constantly addressed lessons of morality; yet it is not sectarian or theologicaL It is a social organization only so far as it fur - nishes additional inducement that men may foregather in numbers, thereby providing more material for its primary work of education, of worship, and of charity. Through the improvement and strengthening of the character of the individual man, Freemasonry seeks to improve the community. Thus it impresses upon its members the principles of personal right - eousness and personal responsibility, enlightens them as to those things which make for human welfare, and inspires them with that feeling of charity, or good will, toward all mankind which will move them to translate principle and conviction into action. To that end, it teaches and stands for the worship of God; truth and justice; fraternity and philanthropy; and enlightenment and orderly liberty, civil, religious and intellectual. It charges each of its members to be true and loyal to the government of the country to which he owes allegiance and to be obedient to the law of any state in which he may be. It believes that the attainment of these objectives is best accomplished by laying a broad basis of prin - ciple upon which men of every race, country, sect and opinion may unite rather than by setting up a restricted platform upon which only those of certain races, creeds and opinions can assemble. Believing these things, this Grand Lodge affirms its continued adherence to that ancient and approved rule of Freemasonry which forbids the discussion in Masonic meetings of creeds, politics, or other topics likely to excite personal animosities. It further affirms its conviction that it is not only contrary to the fundamental principles of Free- APPENDIX 485 masonry, but dangurous to its unity, strength, use - fulness and welfare, for Masonic Bodies to take action or attempt to exercise pressure or influence for or against any legislation, or in any way to attempt to procure the election or appointment of governmental officials, or to influence them, whether or not mem - bers of the Fraternity, in the performance of their official duties. The true Freemason will act in civil life according to his individual judgment and the dictates of his conscience. (Augmented 1948) Masonry abhors Communism, Fascism and any form of dictatorship, as being repugnant to its conception of the dignity of the individual personality, destruc - tive of the basic human rights which are the Divine heritage of all men, and inimical to the fundamental Masonic tenets of faith in God.

This regulation must have been communicated to ihe Masons of Carolina. and to its influence. I suppose. we are to atirihute the fact that from the year 1748 to 1750. hoth Inclusive. - there is not the slightest notice of a Masonic celebration to be found in the contemporary journal.
