The demand of~ the Craft throughout the State for a practical working Monitor of the three degrees, ar - ranged in conformity with the work in this jurisdiction, culminated in the adoption, by the Grand Lodge of 1902, of the following resolution: “Resolved, That Brother George Thornburgh be re - quested to prepare a Monitor which shall be adopted as the Monitor of this Grand Lodge. When the pro - posed Monitor is approved by the Custodians of the Work, the Grand Lecturer, and the Grand IVlaster, the Grand Master shall be authorized to recommend it to the Lodges.” This Monitor has been prepared in obedience to that resolution. The book is the child of my heart and mind. A love for the cause inspired its preparation. It goes to the Craft with my earnest prayers that it may cause a more general and closer study of the beautiful cere - monies of the first three degrees, which are the foun - dation of all true Freemasonry. I dedicate the book to the IVlasons of Arkansas, who have so often and so kindly honored me above my merit. GEO. THORNBURGH. Little Rock, Ark..

The prep4ation to which the candidate must submit before enteri~ig the Lodge serves allegorically to teach him that it is~ the man alone, divested of all the outward recommendations of rank, state, or riches, that Masonry accepts, and that it is spiritual and moral worth alone which can open for him the door of the Masonic Temple.

The three Lesser Lights are the Sun, Moon, and Master of the Lodge, and are thus explained: As the Sun rules the day and the Moon governs the night, so should the Worshipful Master, with equal reg - ularity, endeavor to rule and govern the Lodge. The Representatives of the three Lesser Lights are Ii three burning tapers, placed in a triangular form U~~.the altar. • * * 21 The Lamb Skin or White Leather Apron is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason; more ancient than the Go en Fleece; more honorable than the Star and Garter, r any other order than can be conferrred upon you at t is or any future period by King, Prince, or Potentate, or ny other person, except he be a Mason and in the bo y of a Lodge.

It is yours; yours to wear throughout an honorable life, and at your death, if you are a Master Mason, to be deposited on the coffin which shall inclose your lifeless remains, and with them laid in the grave.

The Working Tools of an Entered Apprentice are the Twenty-four-inch Gauge and the Common Gavel The Twenty-four-inch Gauge is an instrument used by operative Masons to measure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use it for the more noble and glorious purpose of duvid - ing our time. Tt being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematical of the twenty~-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby are found eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy brother, eight for our usual x o - cations, and eight for refreshment and sleep The Common Gavel is an instrument used by opera - tive Masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts ENTERED APPRENTICE. 23 and conscie ces of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitt ng us as living stones, for that spirit - ual building that house not made with hands—eteraal in the heav as. * * * Lesson of Charity.

At tlue building of King Solomon’s Temple there was uuot lueard the sound of ax, hammer, or any tool of iron.

The stones were hewn, squared, and numbered in the quarries where they were raised; the timbers were"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ENTERED APPRENTICE. 25 ENTERED APPRENTICE. 24 relled and prepared in the forests of Lebano , conveyed in floats by sea to Joppa, and thence by la~ to Jerusa - lem, where they were set up by the aid of w oden imple - ments prepared for that purpose; so that very part of the building, when completed, fitted wit such exact nicety that it resembled the handiwork o the Supreme Architect of the Universe more than t at of human hands. * * * Masonry regards no man for his worldly wealth or honors; it is therefore the internal and not the external (lual]fications of the man that recommend him to be - come a Mason. * * * In the fourth chapter of the book of Ruth we read: “Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.” Cable * * * Hood * * * K—no—ks. * * * “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” * * * * * * Trust in Clod. * * * The Left Side. * * * The Right Hand, by our ancient brethren, was deemed the seat of fidelity.

The lambskin is therefore to remind you of that purity of life and conduct which is so essen - tially necessary to your gaining admission to the Celes - tial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. Northeast Corner. It is customary at the erection of all Masonic edifices to lay the first or foundation stone in the northeast corner of the building. The first instruction the candidate receives symbolizes the corner stone on which he con - structs the moral and Masonic temple of his life. Before entering upon any great or important under - taking, we ought always to invoke the aid of Deity."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"E ~TERZD APPRENTICE. 26 If THIRD sECTIoIq. f This section explains the manner of con - stituting and the proper authority f~r holding a Lodge. Also, where anciently held, its Form, Supports, Covering, etc. A Lodge is an assemblage of Masons, duly congregated, having the Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses, and a dispensation or charter authorizing them to work. Our ancient brethren held their Lodges on high hills or in low vales; the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, ascending or descending. Lodge meetings at the present day are usually held in upper chambers—probably for the secur - ity which such places afford. This custom may have had its origin in a practice observed by the ancient Jews of building their temples, schools, and synagogues on high hills, a practice which seems to have met the approbation of the Almighty, who said unto the Prophet Ezekiel, “Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. ENTERED APPRENTICE. 27 Form and Dimension. Its form is oblong. Its dimension, from e~st to west, embracing every clime between north and south. Its universal chain of friend - ship encircles every portion of the human family and beams wherever civilization extends. A Lodge is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Freemasonry, and teaches that a Mason’s charity should be equally extensive. The Supports of a Lodge. A Lodge is supported by three great pillars; denominated Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, because there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. They are represented by the three principal officers of the Lodge: The pillar, Wisdom by the W. M. in the East, who is presumed to have wisdom to open and govern the Lodge; the pillar Strength, by the Senior Warden in the West, whose duty it is to assist the W. M. in the discharge of his arduous labors; and the pillar Beauty, by the Junior Warden in the South, whose duty it is to call the Craft from labor to refreshment, su - perintend them during the hours thereof, care - fully to observe that the means of refreshment"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"28 ENTERED APPRENTICE. ENTERED APPRENTICE. are not perverted to intemperance or excess, and see that they return to their labor in due season. Covering. Its covering is no less than the clouded canopy or starry-decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive by the aid of that theological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw extending from earth to heaven, the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope, and Charity; which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity: for Faith may be lost in sight, Hope end in fruition, but Charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. Furniture. The Furniture of a Lodge consists of the Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man; the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Com - passes to the Craft, because, by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe I’ I 29 their desires, and keep their passions within due bounds. Ornaments. The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the Indented Tessel, of that beautiful tessellated border or skirtjng which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel, or tessellated border, of the manifold blessings and comforts which constantly sur - round us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm reliance on Divine Providence, which is hiero - glyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. Lights. A Lodge has three symbolic Lights: one in the East, one in the West, and one in the South, represented by the W. M., S. W., and J. W. There is no light in the north, because King Solomon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a representation, was so far north of the ecliptic"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"3C ENTERED APPRENTICE. 3’ ENTERED APPRENTICE. that the sun could dart no rays into the northern part thereof. The north, therefore, we Ma - sonically call a place of darkness. Jewels. A Lodge has six Jewels, three of these are immovable and three movable. The Immovable Jewels are the Square, Level, and Plumb. The Square inculcates morality; the Level, equality, and the Plumb, rectitude of conduct. They are called Immovable Jewels, because they are always to b~ found in the East, West, and South parts of the Lodge, being worn by the officers in their respective stations. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle-Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone as taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state. By it we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of the Fellow Craft; and re minds us of that state of perFection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessings of God. The Trestle-Board is for the Master workman to draw his designs upon. By it we are re - minded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on his trestle-board, so should we, both operative and speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Uni - verse, in the great books of nature and revela - tion, which are our spiritual, moral, and Masonic trestle-hoards. How Situated. A Lodge is situated due east and west, be - cause King Solomon’s Temple was so situated; and also because, when Moses crossed the Red Sea, being pursued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he erected a Tabernacle by Divine command, and placed it due east and west to receive the first rays of the rising sun, and to commemorate that mighty east wind by which the miraculous deliverance of Israel was effected. Dedication of Lodges.

The point represents the individual brother; the circle, the boundary line of his duty, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, interests, or prejudices, to betray him. In going around this circle we necessarily touch on the two parallel lines, as well as the Holy Scriptures; and while a Ma’son keeps himself circumscribed within these due bounds, it is impossible that he should materially err. Tenets. The three great tenets of a Mason’s profes - sion inculcate the practice of those commendable virtues, Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. Brotherly Love.—By the exercise of broth - erly love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family—the high and ENTERED APPRENTICE. 33 low, the rich and poor—who, created by one Almighty Parent and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid and protect one another. On this principle Freemasonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. Relief.—To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who profess to be linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our Friendships and establish our connections. Truth.—Truth is a divine attribute, an~1 the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct; hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us; sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. S — ___________—"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"34 ENTERED APPRENTICE. ENTERED APPRENTICE. 35 P. P. E. The P. P. E. are explained in connection with the four cardinal virtues, which are Forti - tiide, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice. Fortitude is that noble and steady purpose ~f the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain or peril, when prudentially deemed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from - rashness and cowardice, and should be deeply impr~ssed upon the mind of every Mason. It is a safeguard or security against the success of any attempt, by force or otherwise, to extort from him any of those valuable secrets with which he has been solemnly intrusted, and which were emblematically impressed upon him on his first admission into the Lodge, when he was received on * * * which refers to * * * Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge and pru - dentially determine on all things relative to our present as well as to our future happiness. This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should be his constant care, when in any strange or mixed company, never to let fall the least sign, token, or word, whereby the secrets of Masonry might be unlaw - fully obtained; ever bearing in mind that inipor - tant occasion when his left * * * which alludes to ~ * * Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice.

Entered Apprentices should serve their Mas - ters with freedom, fervency, and zeal, which are represented by Chalk, Charcoal, and Clay. There is nothing freer than Chalk, the slight - est touch of which leaves a trace; there is nOth - ing more fervent than Charcoal, for to it, when properly ignited, the most obdurate metals will yield; th6re is nothing more zealous than Clay. Our Mother Earth alone of all the elements has never proved unfriendly to man. Bodies of Water deluge him with rain, oppress him with hail, and drown him with inundation; the Air rushes in storms and prepares the tempest; and Fire lights up the volcano; but the Earth, ever kind and indulgent, is found subservient to his wishes. Though constantly harassed more to furnish the luxuries than the necessaries of life, she never refuses her accustomed yield, spread - ing his pathway with flowers and his table with plenty. Though she produces poison, still she supplies the antidote, and returns with interest overy good committed to her care; and when at last we are called upon to pass through the “dark valley of the shadow of death,” she once more receives us, and piously covers our remains within her bosom, thus admonishing us that as from it we came, so to it we must shortly return. * * * Lecture. * * * Symbolism of the Degree. - The First, or Entered Apprentice, degree of Masonry-is intended, symbolically, to represent the entrance of man into the world in which he is afterwards to become a living and thinking actor. Coming from the ignorance and dark - ness of the outer world, his first craving is for light—not that physical light which springs from the great orb of day as its fountain, but that moral and intellectual light which emanates from the primal Source of all things—from the Great Architect of the Universe—the Creator of the sun and of all that it illuminates. Hence the great, the primary, object of the first degree is to symbolize the birth of intellectual light in the mind; and the Entered Apprentice is the type of the unregenerate man, groping in moral"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"38 I ENTERED APPRENTIcE. and mental darkness, and seeking for the light which is to guide his steps and point him to the path which leads to duty and to Him who gives to duty its reward. Charge at Initiation. Brother: As you are now introduced to the first principles of Freemasonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and honorable Fraternity. Ancient, as having ex - isted from time immemorial; and honorable, as tending in every particular so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are contained in the several Masonic lec - tures. The wisest and best of men in all a.ges have been encouragers and promoters of our Art, and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity Co level themselves with the Fra - ternity, to extend its privileges, and to patronize its assemblies. There are three great duties which as a Mason you are charged to inculcate: To God, to your neighbor, and to yourself. To God, in never mentioning His name,save with that reverential ENTERED APPRENTIcE. 39 awe which is due from the creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings, and esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square and doing unto him as you would that he should do unto you. And to yourself, iii avoiding all irregularities and intemperance which may impair. your faculties or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. in the State you are to be a quiet and peace - able citizen, true to your government and just to your country. You are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live, yielding obedience to the laws which afford you protection. un your outward demeanor be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity or influence you to be guilty of dishonorable action. Although your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"40 ENTERED APPRENTICI~. is not meant that Freemasonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignor - ance, may ridicule it.

The Plumb is an instrument used by Opera - tive Masons to try perpendiculars, the Square tb square their work, and the Level to prove horizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use~thein for more noble and glorious purposes. The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations be - fore God and man, squaring our actions by the Square of Virtue, ever remembering that we are traveling upon the Level oF Time to that “un - discovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns.” * * * SECOND SECTION. You now represent a young F. C. on his way to the M. C. of K. S. T. to have his name enrolled among the workmen and to be taught the wages of a F. C. Masonry is divided into two classes, operative and specu - lative. We have wrought in speculative Ma - sonry, but our ancient brethren wrought in both operative and speculative. They wrought at the building of K. S. T. and many other Masonic edifices. They wrought but six days in a week, and rested upon the seventh, for in six days God created the heaven and the earth and rested Fz~ww Cn~&r7. 43 on the seventh; the seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest, the better to enable them to contemplate the glorious works of creation and to adore their great Creator. On our way to the M. C. the first things that attract our attention are the representatives of two brazen pillars, one upon the left, the other upon the right, of the porch. The one upon the left, denominated * * * denoted strength; the one upon the right, denominated ** * denoted establishment, having reference to a passage of Scripture wherein God said to David, “And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee.” Those pillars were eighteen cubits high, twelve in circumference, and four in diameter. They were prepared of molten brass, the better to withstand conflagration or inundation. They were cast in the clay grounds of the river Jordan, between Succoth and Zeredathah, where K. S. ordered all the holy vessels to be cast. They were hollow, four inches, or a hand’s breadth, in thickness, and served as the archives of Masonry, in which the Rolls, Records, and Pro - ceedings were kept. They were adorned with two chapiters, five cubits each. Those chapiters V 42"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"44 Fsu.ow CR~T. were ornamented with network, lily work and pomegranate, denoting union, peace, and plenty. The network, from its intimate connection, de - noted union. The lily, from its whiteness, denoted peace. The pomegranate, from the exuberance of its seeds, denoted plenty. Mounted upon the chapiters were two globes, represent - ing the terrestrial and celestial bodies, on the convex surface of which were delineated tht~ countries, seas, and other portions of the earth, the planetary revolutions and other important particulars. They represent the universality of Freemasonry —that from east to west and between north and south Freemasonry extends, and in every clime are Masons to be found, and teach that a Mason’s charity should be co - extensive. Masonic tradition informs us that those pil - lars were placed at the porch of K. S.’s T. as a memento to the children of Israel of their happy deliverance from the land of bondage, and rep - resented the pillar of cloud that overshadowed them by day and the pillar of fire that illumined them by night. The next thing that attracts our attention i~ a flight of winding stairs, composed of three, i I Fzi~ww Cn~&r7. 45 five, and seven steps. The three steps allude to the three principal officers of the Lodge, and the three principal supports in Masonry. The three principal officers are the W. M., S. W., and J. W. The three principal supports are Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty; because it is necessary to have wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn, all well gov - erned institutions. The five steps allude to the five orders of architecture, and the five human senses. T~ie five orders of architecture are the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite, three of which, from their antiquity, have ever been held in high repute among Masons—the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. The five human senses are hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting, and smelling, the first three of which have ever been held in high repute among Masons, because by hearing we hear the * * *; by seeing we see the * * *. and by feeling we feel the * * *, whereby one Mason may know another in the dark as well as in the light.

(Note—A line effect can be had, if an organ is played, by using the following. The organist should begin to play softly when the speaker begins on ‘‘Music.”) Music is that elevated science which affects the passions by sound. There are few who have not felt its charms, and acknowledged its expressions to be intelligible to the heart. It is a language of delightful sensations, far more eloquent than words; it breathes to the ear the clearest intimations; it touches and gently agi - tates the agreeable and sublime passions; it wraps us in melancholy, elevates us in joy, and melts us in tenderness. Now the pathetic dies away and martial strains are heard, reminding us of the battlefield and its attendant glory. (As the word “glory” is pronounced the organist at once strikes the chords of some war-music like “Dixie,” “~4arseillaise Hymn,” etc. After a few bars are played with full organ, the organist lets the music die away to a soft and gentle tremolo, and the Deacon resumes.)

They became highly incensed because they were not called to share in the rich spoils of the Ammo - nitish war, raised an exceeding great army, crossed the river Jordan,came down upon Jeph - thah and gave him battle. Jephthah, being apprised of their approach,called outthe mighty men of Gilead and put the Ephraimites to flight. And to make his victory secure, he placed guards at all the passes on the river Jordan, giving them this password: Shibboleth.

This gave rise to societies and birth to every useful art.

This section illustrates certain hieroglyphical emblems, and inculcates many useful and im - pressive moral lessons. It also details many particulars relative to the building of the Temple at Jerusalem. King Solomon’s Temple. This magnificent structure was founded in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon, on the second day of the month Zif, being the second month of the sacred year. It was located on Mt. Moriah, near the place where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and where David met and appeased the destroying angel. Josephus informs us that, though more than seven years were occupied in building it, yet during the whole term, it did not rain in the daytime, that the workmen might not be ob - structed in their labor. From sacred history we also learn that there was not the sound of ax, hammer, or any tool of iron, heard in the MASTER MASON. 65 house while it was in building. It is said to have been supported by 1,453 columns~ and 2,906 pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. It was symbolically supported, also, by three pillars. The three pillars here represented were ex - plained in a preceding degree, and there rep - resented Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty. Here they represent our three ancient Grand Mas - ters: S. K. of I., H. K. of T., and H. A.; the pillar Wisdom, S.

S. in his great and important undertaking; and the pillar Beauty, H. A., the W. S., of the tribe of Naphtali, by whose cunning workmanship the Temple was so beautified and adorned. There were employed in its building 3 Grand Masters, 3~300 Masters or overseers of the work, 80,000 Fellow Crafts, and 70,000 Entered Ap - prentices or bearers of buydens.

In front of the magnificent porch were placed the two celebrated pillars—one on the left hand, and one on the right hand. They are supposed to have been placed there as a memorial to the children of Israel of the happy deliverance of their forefathers from Egyptian bondage, and in commemoration of those two miraculous pillars of fire and of cloud. The pillar of fire gave light to the children of Israel and facilitated their march. The cloud proved darkness to Pharaoh and his host and retarded their pur - suit. King Solomon therefore ordered these pillars placed at the entrance of the Temple, as the most conspicuous place, that the children of lsrael might have that happy event contin - ually before their eyes in going to and returning from divine worship. The Three Steps. The three steps usually delineated upon the Master’s Carpet are emblematical of the three MAs~rER MASON. 67 principal stages of human life: Youth, Manhood, and Age. In Youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge in the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor, and ourselves, so that in Age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy re - flection consequent on a well-spent life ,~and die in the hope of a glorious immortality.

When we take a survey of Nature we view man in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man independent of all created beings; but as de - pendence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on one another for protection and security, thereby enjoying better opportunities of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God; and he who will so demean himself as not to endeavor to add to the common stock of knowledge may be deemed a drone in the hive of Nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons. r MASTER MASON. 6g The Book of Constitutions.

We meet on and shall be very glad to welcome you to any of our meetings.” The Senior Deacon condccts the visitor to a seat and the Lodge is seated. If the visitor is to be examined the W. M. appoints a committee, who retire at the door of the preparation room, the S. D. passing them out. When the committee are ready to report, they make an alarm at the door of the preparation room. The S. D. attends to it, and re - ports that the examining committee desire admission. The W. M. directs him to admit them. When he goes to the door, if the committee expect to report favorably they will introduce the S. D. to the ~isitor.

Any I member of the Lodge has the right to object to the ad - mission of a visitor, but the grounds of the objection must be stated to the W. M., who shall judge of the sut - ficiency thereof. If there be no objection, the W. M. directs the S. D. to introduce the brother. The S. D. presents him at the altar and introduces him to the W. M., who in turn introduces him to the Lodge in the form above. No brother should be allowed to visit a Lodge for the first time without an introduction. If the visitor is a Past Master, he should be invited to a seat in the East. II~~STITUTING A LODGE UNDER DISPENSATION. The members of the new Lodge, whether they are to be instituted by the Grand Master, or by a brother deputized by him, will, in either case, be notified by the Master to assemble in their Lodge room at the time de - terinined upon. After the brethren are assembled, the Grand Master, or Institcting Officer, will assume the East and announce the object of the meeting. He then canses the Letter of Dispensation to be read, after which the names of the officers appointed by the Grand Master and by the Master of the new Lodge will be announced. As these names are called, the officers will form in line near and facing the East, when each officer will be in - vested with his jewel. The new 1\\Iaster will then be seated in tho East, on the right of the Instituting Officer. The Wardens and other officers will take their respective si ations.

For a pattern of imitation, consider the sun, which, rising in the east, regularly diffuses light and luster to all within its circle. In like manner, it is in your province to spread and communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your Lodge. Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high importance of Masonry; and seriously admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to practice out of the lodge, those duties which they have been taught in it; and by amiable, discreet, and virtuous, conduct, to convince mankind of the good - ness of the Institution; so that, when any one is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sor• rows, to whom distress may prefer its suit, whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence.

You should be examples of good order and regularity, for it is only by a due regard to the laws, in your own conduct, that you can expect obedience to them from others. You are assiduously to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust, diffusing light and imparting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care.

The honor, reputation, and usefulness, of this Lodge will materially depend upon the skill and fidelity with which you manage its con - cerns, while the happiness of its members will be generally promoted in proportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the genuine principles of our institution. As a pattern for imitation, consider the great luminary of Nature, which, rising in the East,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"104 INSTALLATION. regularly diffuses light and luster to all within the circle. lIn lLke manner, it is your province to spread and communicate light and instruc - tion to the brethren of your Lodge. Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high im - portance of Masonry, and seriously admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to practice out of thc Lodge those duties which they have been taught in it; and by amiable, discreet, and virtuous, conduct, to convince man - kind of the goodness of the institution, so that when a person is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows, to whom distress may appeal for help, whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is ex - panded by benevolence. In short, by a diligent observance of the By - laws of the Lodge, the Constitutions of Free - masonry, and, above all, the Holy scriptures, which are given as a rule and a guide to your faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with honor and reputation, and lay up a crown of rejoicing which shall continue when time shall be no more. Brothers Senior and Junior Warden: You are too well acquainted with the principles of r INSTALLATION. 105 Masonry to warrant any distrust that you will be found wanting in the discharge of your re - spective duties. Suffice it to say, that what you have seen praiseworthy in others you should carefully imitate; and what~ in them may have appeared defective you should in yourselves amend. You should be examples of good order and regularity; for it is only by a due regard to the laws in your own conduct that you can expect obedience to them form others. You are faith fully to assist the Miaster in the discharge of his duties, for in his absence you will be required to perform the same; your acquirements must therefore be such thaf the Craft may never suffer for want of proper in - struction. From the spirit which you have hitherto evinced, I entertain no doubt that your future conduct will be such as to merit the applause of your brethren and the testi - mony of a good conscience.

Humility in both is an essential duty. The officers who are chosen to govern your Lodge are sufficiently conversant with the rules of propriety, and the laws of the institution, to avoid exceeding the powers with which they are intrusted, and you are too generous to envy their promotion. I therefore trust that you will have hut one aim— to please each other, and unite in the grand design of being happy and communicating hap - piness. Finally, my brethren, as this Lodge has been formed and perfected in so much unanimity and~concord, so may it long continue. May you long enjoy every satisfaction and delight which disinterested friendship can afford. May kind - ness and brotherly affection distinguish your conduct as men and as Masons. Within your peaceful walls may your children’s children celebrate, with joy and gratitude, the annual recurrence of this auspicious solemnity; and may the tenets of our profession be transmitted through this Lodge, pure and unimpaired, from generation to generation.

Our march around the Lodge reminds us of the travels of human life, in which Masonry is an enlightened, a safe, and a pleasant path.

The hall is also dedicated to Virtue. This worthy appropriation will always be duly re - garded while the moral duties which our sublime lectures inculcate, with affecting and impressive pertinency, are cherished in our hearts and illustrated in our lives. As Freemasonry aims to enliven the spirit of Phi - lanthropy, and promote the cause of Charity, so we dedi - cate this Hall to Universal Benevolence; in the assur - ance that every brother will dedicate his affections and his ability to the same generous purpose; that while he displays a warm and cordial affection to those who are of the Fraternity, he will extend his benevolent regards and good wishes to the whole family of mankind. Such, my brethren, is the significant meaning of the solemn rites we have just performed, because such are the peculiar duties of every Lodge.

Their import and their appli - cation are famiLiar to you all. In their knowledge and their exercise may you fulfill the high purposes of the Masonic Institution. How many pleasing considerations, my brethren, attend the pleasant interview! While in almost every other association of men, political animosities, conten - tions, and wars, interrupt the progress of Humanity and the cause of Benevolence, it is our distinguished privi - lego to dwell together in peace, and engage in plans to perfect individual and social happiness. While in many other nations our Fraternity is viewed by politicians with r DgDICATION or HALLS. 127 suspicion, and by the ignorant with apprehension, in this country, its members are too much respected, and its principles too well known, to make it the object of jealousy or mistrust. Our private assemblies are unmo - lested, and our public celebrations attract a more generaL approbation of the Fraternity. Indeed, its importance, its credit, and, we trust, its usefulness, are advancing to a height unknown in any former age. The present occasion gives fresh evidence of the increasing affectioa of its friends; and this noble apartment, fitted up in a style of such elegance and convenience, does honor to Freemasonry, as well as reflects the hig’hest credit on the respectable Lodge for whose accommodation and at whose expense it is erected. We offer our best congratulations to the Worshipful Master, Wardens, Officers, and Members of Lodge. We commend their zeal, and hope it will meet with the most ample recompense. May their Hall be the happy resort of Piety, Virtue, and Benevolence! May it be protected from accident, and long remain a monument of their attachment to Freemasonry! May their Lodge continue to flourish; their union to strengthen; and their happiness to abound! And when they, and we all, shall be removed from the labors of the earthly Lodge, may we be admitted to the brother - hood of the perfect, in the building of God, the Hall not made with hands, eternal in the heavens!

[The following exhortation is then given by the Master:] The solemn notes that betoken the dissolution of this earthly tabernacle have again alarmed our outer door, and another spirit has been summoned to the land where our fathers have gone before us. Again we are called to assemble among the habita - tions of the dead, to behold the ‘‘narrow house appointed for all living.” Here, around us, in that peace which the world can not give nor take away, sleep the unnum - bered dead. The gentle breeze fans their verdant cov - ering, they heed it not; the sunshine and the storm pass over them, and they are not disturbed; stones and let - tered monuments symbolize the affection of surviving friends, yet no sound proceeds from them, save that silent but thrilling admonition, “Seek ye the narrow path and the straight gate that lead unto eternal life.” We are again called upon to consider the uncertainty of human life, the immutable certainty of death, and the vanity of all human pursuits. Decrepitude and decay are written upon every living thing. The cradle and the coffin stand in juxtaposition to each other; and it is a melancholy truth that so soon as we begin to live, that moment we also begin to die. It is passing strange that, notwithstanding the daily mementos of mortality that cross our path—notwithstanding the funeral bells so often toll in our ears and the “mournful processions” go about our streets—we will not more seriously con - sider our approaching fate. We go on from design to design, add hope to hope, and lay ont plans for the [40"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"‘A - -U - FUNERAL Snvicz. 142 employment of many years, until we are suddenly alarmed at the approach of the Messenger of Death, at a moment when we least expect him, and which we probably con - clude to be the meridian of our existence. What, then, are all the externals of human dignity— the power of wealth, the dreams of ambition, the pride of intellect, or the charms of beauty—when Nature has paid her just debt? Fix youl eyes on the last sad scene, and view life stripped of its ornaments, and exposed in its natural weakness, and you must be persuaded by the utter emptiness of these delusions. In the grave, all fallacies are detected, all ranks are leveled, all dis - tinctions are done away. Here the scepter of the prince and the staff of the beggar are laid side by side. Our present meeting and proceedings will have been vain and useless, if they fail to excite our serious reflec - tions, and strengthen our resolutions of amendment. - Be then persuaded, my brethren, by this example of the uncertainty of human life, of the unsubstantial nature of all its pursuits, and no longer postpone the all important concern of preparing for eternty. Let us each embrace the present moment, and while time and op - portunity permit, prepare for that great change when the pleasures of the world will be as a poison to our lips, and the happy reflection consequent upon a well-spent life afford the only consolation. Thus shall our hopes be not frustrated, nor we be hurried unprepared into the presence of that all-wise and powerful Judge, to whom the secrets of all hearts are known. Let us resolve to maintain with sincerity the dignified character of our profession. May our Faith be evinced in a correct moral walk and deportment; I FUNERAL Sutv’cL ‘43 may our Hope be bright as the glorious mysteries that will be revealed hereafter; and our Charity boundless as the wants of our fellow-creatures. And, having faithfully discharged the great duties which we owe to God, to our neighbor, and to ourselves, when at last it shall please the Grand Master of the Universe to summon us unto His eternal presence, may the Trestleboard of our whole lives pass such inspection that it may be given unto each of us to “eat of the hidden manna” and to receive the “white stone with a new name” that will insure perpetual and unspeakable happiness at His right hand. [The Lambskin having been removed from the coffin the Master holds it up and says:] W.

Unto the grave we consign his body—earth to earth; ashes to ashes; dust to dust—there to remain until the trump shall sound on the Resurrection morn. We can trustfully leave him in the hands of Him who doeth all things well, who is “glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders.” To those of his immediate relatives and friends who are most heart-stricken at the loss we have all sustained, we have little of this world’s consolation to offer; but we do sincerely, deeply and most affectionately sympathize with them in their bereavenient; and say, that He who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb looks down with infinite compassion upon the widow and fatherless in the hour of their desolation; and that our Heavenly Father will fold the arms of His FUNERAL SERvIcE. ‘47 love and protection around those who put their trust in Him.

RITUAL FOR A LOD E OF SORROW The following Ritual for a Lod e of Sonow is recom - mended for use in the Lodges. hile necessarily of a funeral character, it differs essentially from the burial service. In the latter case, we are iii. the actual presence of the’ departed, and engaged in the last rites of affec - tion and respect for one who has been our companion in life and ‘whose mortal remains we are about to con - sign to their last resting-place. The Lodge of Sorrow, on the contrary, is intended to celebrate the memory of our departed brethren; and ~hile we thus recall to our recollection their virtues, and temper anew our reso - lutions so to live, that, when we shall have passed the silent portals, our memories may be cherished with grate - ful remembrance, we learn to look upon death from a more elevated point of view; to see in it the wise and necessary transition from the trials and imperfections of this world, to the perfect life for which our transient journey here has been the school and the preparation. Vocal and instrumental music are indispensable to the proper effect of the ceremony. The brethren should wear dark clothing, and white gloves and aprons. There is no necessity for any attempt at secrecy in the cere - monies of Sorrow Lodges. They may be held in churches or public halls, or in the pr~sence of friends at the Lodge room, with benefit to all concerned. These services may be abridged if desired.

O brother, thou art gone to rest, And this shall be our prayer: That, when we reach our journey’s end, Thy glory we shall share. [The Worshipful Master, taking the skull in his hand, will then say:] Brethren:—In the midst of life we are in death, and the wisest can not know what a day may bring forth. I 1 ‘I LODGE Soaaow. x6x We live but to see those we ove passing away into the silent land. Behold this emblem of morta ity, once the abode of a spirit like our own; beneath his mouldering canopy once shone the bright and busy ye; within this hollow cavern once played the ready, swi t, and tuneful tongue; and now, sightless and mute, it is eloquent only in the lessons it teaches us. Think of those brethren, who but a few days since, were among us in all the pride and power of life; bring to your minds the remembrance of their wisdom, their strength, and their beauty; and then reflect that “to this~ complexion have they come at last;” think of your - selves: thus will you be when the lamp of your brief existence has burned out. Think how soon death, for you, will be a reality. Man’s life is like a flower, which blooms today, and tomorrow is faded, cast aside, and trodden under foot. The most of us, my brethren, are fast approaching or have already passed the meridian of life; our sun is setting in the West; and oh! how much more swift is the passage of our declining years than when we started upon the journey, and believed—as the young are too apt to believe—that the roseate hues of the rising sun of our existence were always to be con - tinued. When we look back upon the happy days of our childhood, when the dawning intellect first began to exercise its powers of thought, it seems as but yester - day, and that, by a simple effort of the will, we could put aside our manhood, and seek again the loving caresses of a mother, or be happy in the possession of a bauble; and could we now realize the idea that our last hour had come, our whole earthly life would seem but as the space ‘1 I, f I I ~ -"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"I 162 LODGg or~$oaaow. of time from yesterday ntil today. Centuries upon centuries have rolled awa behind us; before us stretches out an eternity 6f year to come, and on the narrow boundary between the ast and the Present flickers the puny taper we term o r life. When we came into the world, we knew naug t of what had been before us; but, as we grew up t~ manhood, we learned of the past; we saw the flowers bloom as they had bloomed for cen - turies; we beheld the orbs of day and night pursuing their endless course among the stars, as they had pur - sued it from birth of light; we learned what men had thought, and said, and done, from the beginning of the world to our day, but only through the eye of faith can we behold what is to come hereafter, and only through a firm reliance upon the Divine promises can we satisfy the yearnings of an immortal soul. The cradle speaks to us of remembrance—the coffin, of hope, of a blessed trust in a never-ending existence beyond the gloomy portals of the tomb. Let these reflections convince us how vain are all the wranglings and bitterness engendered by the collisions of the world; how little in dignity above the puny wrang - lings of ants over a morsel of food, or for the possession of a square inch of soil. What shall survive us? Not, let us hope, the petty strifes and bickerings, the jealousies and heart-burnings, the small triumphs and mean advantages we have gained, but rather the noble thoughts, the words of truth, the works of mercy and justice, that enuobk and light up the existence of every honest man, however humble, and live for good when his body, 111cc this remnant of mortality, is mouldering in its parent dust. I 4 LODGg ANSoanow. Let the proud and the vaip consider how soon the gaps are filled that are made ~n society by those who die around them; and how sooi\\ time heals the wounds that death inflicts upon the loving heart; and from this let them learn humility, and th~t they are but drops in the great ocean of humanity. And when God sends his angel to us with the scroll of death, let us look upon it as an act of mercy, to pre - vent many sins and many calamities of a longer life; and lay down our heads softly and go to sleep, with - out wrangling like froward children. For this at least man gets by death, that his calamities are not immor - tal. To bear grief honorably and temperately, and to die willingly and nobly, are the duties of a good and true Mason. Ode.

Let the loss of our brethren in - crease our affection for those who are yet spared to us, and make us more punctual in the performance of the duties that friendship, love, and honor demand. ~When it comes to us also to die, may a firm and abiding trust in Thy mercy dispel the gloom and dread of dissolution.

Let these ‘flowers be to us the symbol of remembrance of all the virtues of our hrethren who have preceded us to the silent land, the token of that fraternal alliance which binds us while on earth and which we hope will finally unite us in heaven. The Senior Warden returns to his place, and an in - terval of profound silence will be observed. The pro - cession will again be formed, and move three times around the catafalque to slow and solemn music, as before. Ar - rived in the East, the Worshipful Master will advance and place upon the Urn a wreath of evergreen, and say: I Worshipful Master: It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after death cometh the resurrection. The dust shall return to the earth and the spirit unto God who gave it. In the grave all men are equal; the good deeds, the lofty thoughts, the heroic sacrifices alone survive and bear fruit in the lives of those who strive to emulate them. While, therefore, nature will have its way, and our tears will fall upon the graves of our brethren, let us be reminded by the evergreen symbol of our faith in immortal life that the dead are but sleeping, and be comforted by the reflection that their memories will not be forgotten; that they will still be loved by those who are seen to foliow them; that in our archives their names are written, and that in our hearts there is still a place for them. And so, trusting in the infinite love and tender mercy of Him without whose knowledge I LODGg or Som~ow. not even a sparrow falls, let us prepare to meet then~ where there is no parting, and where with them we shall enjoy eternal rest. The Worshipful Master will return to his place, and a period of silence will obtain. The Chaplain will now be conducted to the altar, where he will read: Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corrup - tion inherit incorruption. Behold, I show you a mys - tery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

So when this corruptible shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in vic - tory. 0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory?

At the session of the Grand Lodge of Arkansas, November, 1902, Past Grand Master, J. W. Sorrels in - troduced the resolution which appears on page v. I had filled the office of Worshipful Master fifteen consecutive years, and was at the time of the adoption of the resolution, Chairman of the Board of Custodians of the Secret Work, and was therefore necessarily famil - iar with the ritualistic and the monitorial work, which was doubtless the reason I was requested to make the Monitor. From November, 1902, to August, 1903, I devoted most of my time to its preparation. I placed the draft of the book in the hands of the Grand Master and the other two Custodians of the Secret Work, who gave the following: CERTIFICATE AND RECOMMENDATION THIs is TO CERTIFY that we have examined the manuscript of the Monitor, prepared . by Bro. George Thornburgh, and we approve same, W. M. KENT, Custodian. GP~ORGE W. DEVAUGHAN, Custodian. J. M. QATHOUT, Grand Lecturer. JOHN T. HICKS, Grand Master. Office of the Grand Master, Grand Lodge F. and A. M. of Arkansas: Little Rock, Ark., August 19, 1903. This Monitor, prepared by Past Grand Master George Thornburgh, having been ap - proved by the Custodians of the Work, the Grand Lecturer, and myself, I do recommend the use of the same to all the Lodges in Arkansas. JOHN T. HICKS, GrandlMaster. ~7O I J"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"I On the 20th of October, 1903, the first edition of one thousand Monitors was placed on sale. By December 20 they were all sold. I placed the second edition of one thousand on sale and by June 15 they were gone. Evi - dently the Monitor filled a long-felt want. The Grand Lodge of 1904 adopted the Monitor as shown on page vi. It was prepared especially to conform to the work in this jurisdiction. It may be studied with profit by every Mason, whether he be an officer or not. The youngest Entered Apprentice will find it helpful and useful in assisting him to fix upon his mind those beautiful first lessons. The officers, from Master of Ceremonies to Wor - shipful Master will find it convenient and indispensable in the performance correctly of the beautiful ceremonies of the institution. I am gratified beyond expression at the cordial recep - tion the Monitor has received from the Craft. It is recommended in the highest terms by the best workers in the State. Here are only a few of the hun - dreds of endorsements sent me: Grand Master Hicks: “It is the best Monitor to be found for Arkansas Masons.” Grand Lecturer Oathout had the manuscript sent to his home that be might very carefully examine it, and he wrote: “1 have carefully examined the manuscript of your Monitor twice over and cheerfully give my in - dorsement, believing it to be the best Monitor I have ever seen. I believe your work will be appreciated by the Craft in Arkansas when they examine the Monitor.” Brother 0. W. DeVaughan, Custodian of the 8ore~ Work: “I am very much pleased with it.” Brother W. M. Kent, the other Custodian of the S.oreI~ Work: ‘‘Good.’’ Our Senior Past Grand Master, C. A. Dannelly, who was so long the Grand Lecturer, says: “I have read It carefully. It is the best Monitor I ever saw. I heartily congratulate you on being the author of such n book. I recommend ~t to all the Lodges. It would be well if every member would supply himself with a copy.’’ Past Grand Master R. H. Taylor: “I have carefully reviewed it from opening to conclusion. It is a work of great merit, concise and clear,~ free and easy of style. It is not alone valuable and useful as a guide to Arkansas Masons, but to Masons everywhete. In fact, if adopted by other Grand Jurisdictions, would simplify and beau - tify Masonic work. Every 1’dason in the State should own and study the Arkansas Monitor.” Past Grand Master Sorrells, who made the motion in Grand Lodge to have the Monitor prepared, says: “I have examined it closely, and feel sure that it will meet the approbation of the Craft throughout this jurisdiction.” Past Grand Master Bridewell: “I have examined it, and find it complete. To a newly made Mason it is in - dispensable, and if every one of them would get a copy immediately after their raising we would have brighter and better Masons. It would do a world of good if many of the older Masons would make it their cede mecum. You have eliminated an immense quantity of useless matter contained in most Monitors, and that which you placed in lieu is clear and easily understood. The chapters ‘1 I j — .w -,~•,‘.•"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"on ‘Laying corner Stones,’ ‘Dedicating Lodges,’ ‘Funer - als,’ etc., will be appreciated by all who have those ser - vices to perform.” Past Grand Master Baker: “Have examined it care - fully and am well pleased. I think it conforms to the ancient usages of Masonry, and I feel sure that by the use of it we will have many more Masons in Arkansas who know something of lodge work. Every Lodge ought to have at least three copies.” Past Grand Master Harry Myers: “I have carefully examined your Monitor and consider it the best for our Lodges possible to get. It is concise, yet comprehensive. It takes up the work and follows it in order. No Lodge should be without it. I wish every Mason in the State would possess himself of this valuable addition to Masonic literature at once.” May it do more and more good as its circulation In - creases and its in.fluence widens.
