How old this ancient Craft is no one really knows— unless its beginnings, as many believe, originated with man’s first ability to think and rationalize for himself. Many conceive it to be as old as the human race. This we do know. Masonic principles and habits characterized much of the very early his - tory of the human family. Therefore, it is very natural that this great present day society of men which we call “Masonry” has grown out of—rn fact, built upon—the normal experiences of every - day life, no matter in what age or period of human development we may view its activities. Turn the pages of history to read of the Ancient Mysteries, of Egyptian mythology, the wisdom of Confucius and Mencius, the Old Testament story of Hebrew civilization, or even Aztec and Peru - vian architecture, not forgetting the secret socie - ties of our own American Indians.

When we come to the end of the Dark Ages, the lost art of Architecture—it was called Masonry then—experienced a revival in the production of truly marvellous and beautiful examples of Cathe - drals, bridges, public buildings, walled towns and feudal castles. Their builders were called Masons. Where they came from no one knows; but they spread over Europe working in France, Germany, and the lowlands of Holland, on into the British Isles, and may have migrated from Lake Como in Lombardy (Italy) or for all we know, from the cradle of Civilization on the banks of the Euph - rates and the Nile. None but Master Builders could have fashioned that Great Pyramid of Gizah in the fifth dynasty about 3000 B. C-, or our own most famous structure—King Solomon’s Temple—when both tradition and Biblical history in Form us of the organization of Masons engaged in its erection about 1000 years B. C.—or of the Tomb of King Tutenkamen in 1362 B. C., whose father preached the doctrine of Monotheism which is so closely integrated with our Masonic belief in the Grand Architect of the Universe. The link between these two periods of civiliza - tion are clouded by conjecture and records which are fragmentary at best—except for this one very important fact: The English language has preserved for us some ninety odd documents written on parchment IN IN IN IN I” or paper scrolls so long ago as the middle of the fourteenth century—the time Mediaeval England was emerging from the Dark Ages and when the Knights of the Crusades were returning to Europe to build out of Feudalism a newer spiritual insti - tution—the Church—from which came those reli - gious attributes which so characterize Masonry’s ethical and moral teachings. The oldest of these documents are the Halliwell Mss., better known perhaps as the “Regius Poem” of about 1390 A.D., and the Cook Mss., of about 1450 A.D. Also, Mary’s Chapel Lodge No. 1 of Edinburgh, Scot - land, does have the oldest Masonic Lodge Minutes extant. They are complete with very few excep - tions from December 28, 1598 to this day. And to Elias Ashmole belongs the distinction of record - ing his Initiation date in his diary as of October 16, 1646. The discovery of printing by Gutenberg in 1540 stimulated the spread of learning and education to such a degree that the cultured and “specula - tive” fellowship of non-operative Craftsman was ~~accepted’’ and ‘‘passed’’ into the inner circles of operative Masonry. Notwithstanding the tensions whtch such a move created between these two classes of membership, Speculative Masonry as we know it grew in England and on the Continent to take the place of the rapidly dwindling mem - bership of skilled operative building tradesmen in a stagnating period of construction activity.

Rev. James Anderson, a Scotch Presbyterian, and John Theo - philus Desaguliers, son of a refugee French Huguenot were responsible for the change in our Masonic doctrine from a purely Christian basis to that of a universal creed which is predicated on God’s Fatherhood and Man’s Brotherhood, and accounts for our strictly modern speculative ac - tivities today. It was not until July 30, 1733 that the First Lodge in America was chartered by R. W. Henry W. Price, who opened St. John’s Grand Lodge at the “Bunch of Grapes Tavern” in Boston. In 1769 Joseph Warren instituted a rival body under a Commission from the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and on March 8, 1777 this Massachusetts Grand Lodge assumed its independence to become the first Grand Lodge in this country to proclaim its sovereignty. During the Colonial period military lodges in British, Scotch and Irish regiments exerted great influence on Freemasonry. Many of their mem - bers settled in the Colonies and joined with the non-military Masonic migrants from the British Isles to form “Lodges Without Warrant.” Such fusions of English, Scotch, Irish, and perhaps other nationalists from Germany, France and Hol. land, are responsible for the ritualistic differences encountered in many of our own jurisdictions. — 10— IN Many Masons were accountable for the forma - tion of our American government, among them George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Paul Revere, John Adams, John Hancock, James Monroe and James Otis. Let us not forget, as Freemasonry moved west - ward across this continent in the wake of Lewis and Clark—both of whom were Masons—Multno - mah Lodge No. 84 of Missouri at Oregon City and now No. I of our Oregon Grand Lodge, be - came the first Masonic Lodge established on the Pacific Coast. Its charter was granted October 19, 1846. Oregon’s Masonic genealogy stems through Missouri, Tennessee, North Carolina and the Grv~d Lodge of En2land. The second Oregon Charter was granted to Willamette No. 11 (now No. 2) at Portland by the Grand Lodge of California on November 27 1850, and the third, from the same jurisdiction (Califotnia),went to Lafayette No. 15 at Lafayette (now Lafayette No. 3 at Yainhill) on May 9, 1851. These three Lodges convened in the Masonic Hall at Oregon City, Oregon Territory, on August 16, 1851 in a preliminary effort “to organize a Wor - shipful Grand Lodge for the Territory of Oregon.” When they reassembled in the same hall “at half past seven A.M., September 15, A.L. 5851, A.D. 185 1,” a constitution for “The Grand Lodge of ANCIENT FREE and ACCEPTED MASONS of the Territory of Oregon” was adopted and Berry- IN IN I.

Among the many Masons identified with the early history of Oregon were Berryman Jennings, the first Grand Master; Benjamin Stark, the first Grand Secretary and Grand Master in 1857 and 1858; Joseph and Orin Kellogg, who brought the “charter trunk” across the plains; Lot Whitcomb, pioneer steamboat operator; J. C. Ainsworth, ship- owner and banker; Thomas J. Dryer, publisher of The Oregonian; John Elliott, first M’aster of Wil - lamette Lodge, Portland, and Joel Palmer, prom!. nent in early Indian affairs. While only nine men were responsible for the organization of Free - masonry in this State, today (1951) our member. ship has increased to more than 40,000—genuinely healthy growth from very humble beginnings. During the first 100 years of our history a Masonic Home has been established at Forest Grove; we — 12 — have accumulated a Life Membership fund of nearly $600,000, and an Educational Fund in cx - .ess of $442,000, the income from which is avail - able for the elementary school needs of the cliii - dren of deceased Master Masons.

But though in ancient times Masons were charged in every country to be of the religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, it is now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves; that is to be good men and true, or men of honor and honesty, by what. ever denomination or persuasions they may be distinguished whereby Masonry becomes the center of union, and the means of conciliating true friendship among persons that must have remained at a perpetual distance. 2. Of the Civil Magistrate, Supreme and Sub - ordinate—A Mason is a peaceable subject of the civil powers wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in plots or conspiracies against the peace and welfare of the nation, nor to behave himself undutifully toward inferior magistrates; for, as Masonry hath always been in - jured by war, bloodshed and confusion, so ancient kings and princes have been much disposed to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their peace - ableness and loyalty, whereby they practically answered the cavils of their adversaries, and pro - moted the honor of the Fraternity, whoever flourished in times of peace. So that if a Brother should be a rebel against the state, he is not to be countenanced in his rebellion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy man; and if con - victed of no other crime, though the loyal broth - erhood must and ought to disown his rebellion, ‘p. IN I. pm p. and give no umbrage or ground of political jealousy to the government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his relation to it remains indefeasible. 3. Of Lodges—A Lodge is a place where Masons assemble and work; hence that assembly, or duly organized society of Masons, is called a Lodge, and every Brother ought to belong to one, and be subject to its By Laws and the General Regulations. It is either particular or general, and will be best understood by attending it, and by the regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annexed. In ancient times, no Master or Fellow could be absent from it, especially when warned to appear at it, without incurring a severe censure, until it appeared to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hindered him. The persons admitted members of a Lodge must be good and true men, free born, and of mature and discreet age, no bondmen, no women, no immoral or scandalous men, but men of good report. 4. Of Masters, Wardens, Fellows and Appren. tices—AlI preferment among Masons is grounded upon real worth and personal merit only; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to shame, nor the Royal Craft despised. There. fore no Master or Warden is chosen by seniority, but for his merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every Brother must attend in his place, and learn them in a way peculiar to this Fraternity; only candidates may know that — 19 — ‘U — 18—"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ANCIENT CHARGES ANCIENT CHARGES no Master should take an Apprentice unless he has sufficient employment for him, and unless he be a perfect youth, having no maim or defect in his body, that may render him incapable of learn - ing the art of serving his Master’s Lord, and of being made a Brother, and then a Fellow Craft in due time, even after he has served such a term of years as the custom of the country directs; and that he should be descended from honest parents; that so, when otherwise qualified, he may arrive at the honor of being the Warden, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Master of all the Lodges, ac - cording to his merit. No Brother can be a Warden until he has passed the part of Fellow Craft; nor a Master until he has acted as Warden; nor Grand Warden until he has been Master of a Lodge; nor Grand Master unless he has been a Fellow Craft before his elec - tion, who is also to be nobly born, or a gentleman of the best fashion, or some eminent scholar, or some curious architect, or other artist, descended of honest parents, and who is of singular great merit in the opinion of the Lodges. And for the better, and easier, and more honorable discharge of his office, the Grand Master has a power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, a Master of a particular Lodge, and has the privilege of acting whatever the Grand Master, his principal, should act, un[ess the said principal be present, or inter - pose his authority by a letter. -- 20— These rulers and governors, supreme and sub - ordinate, of the Ancient Lodges, are to be obeyed in their respective stations by all the Brethren, according to the Old Charges and Regulations, with all humility, reverence, love and alacrity. 5. Of the Management of the Craft in Work - ing—All Masons shall work honestly on working days, that they may live creditably on holy days; and the time appointed by the law of the land, or confirmed by custom, shall be observed. The most expert of the Fellow Craftsmen shall be chosen or appointed the Master, or Overseer, of the Lord’s work; who is to be called Master by those that work under him. The Craftsmen are to avoid all ill language, and to call each other no disobliging name, but Brother or Fellow; and to behave themselves courteously within and without the Lodge. The Master, knowing himself to be able of cunning, shall undertake the Lord’s work as rea - sonably as possible, and truly dispend his goods as if they were his own; nor to give more wages to any Brother or Apprentice that he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons, receiving their wages justly, shall be faithful to the Lord, and honestly finish their work, whether task or journey; nor put the work to task that hath been accustomed to journey.

When a Fellow Craftsman is chosen Warden of the Work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fellows, shall carefully oversee the work in the Master’s absence to the Lord’s profit; and his Brethren shall obey him. All Masons employed shall meekly receive their wages without murmuring or mutiny, and not desert the N4aster till the work is finished. A younger Brother shall be instructed in work - ing to prevent spoiling the materials for want of judgment, and for increasing and continuing of brotherly love. All the tools used in working sha[l be approved by the Grand Lodge. No laborer shall be employed in the propcr work of Masonry; nor shall Freemasons work with those that are not free, without an urgent necessity; nor shall they teach laborers and un - accepted Masons, as they should teach a Brother or Fellow. 6. Of Behavior, Viz; (a) In the Lodge While Constituted—You are not to hold private committees, or separate con - versations, without leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinent or unseemly, nor in- — 22 — m I. ANCIENT CHARGES terrupt the Master or Wardens, or any Brother speaking to the Master; nor behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is en - gaged in what is serious and solemn; nor use any unbecoming language upon any pretense whatso - ever; but to pay due reverence to your Master, Wardens and Fellows, and put them to worship. If any complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the award and determination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent judges of all such controversies (unless you carry it by appeal to the Grand Lodge), and to whom they ought to be referred, unless a Lord’s work be hindered the meanwhile, in which case a particular reference may be made; you must never go to law about what concerneth Masonry, without an absolute necessity apparent to the Lodge. (b) Behavior After the Lodge Is Over and the Brethren Not Gone—You may enjoy yourselves with innocent mirth, treating one another, accord - ing to ability, but avoiding all excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his inclina - tion, or hindering him from going when his occa - sions call him, or doing or saying anything offen - sive, or that may forbid an easy and free conver - sation; for that would blast our harmony and defeat our laudable purposes. Therefore no priv - ate piques or quarrels must be brought within the door of the Lodge, far less any quarrels about religion, or nations, or state policy, we being only as Masons, of the catholic religion above men - tioned; we are also of all nations, tongues, — 23 — ‘U I. ;ii—~"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ANCIENT CHARGES ANCIENT CHARGES kindreds, and languages, and are resolved against all politics, as what never yet conduced to the welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will.

(d) Behavior in Presence of Strangers Not Ma - sons—You shall be cautious in your words and carriage, that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated, and sometimes you shall divert a discourse, and manage it prudently for the honor of the Worshipful Fraternity. (e) Behavior at Home and in Your Neighbor - hood—You are to act as becomes a moral and I wise man; particularly, not to let your family, friends and neighbors know the concerns of the Lodge, etc., but wisely to consult your own honor, and that of the Ancient Brotherhood, for reasons not to be mentioned here. You must also consult your health by not continuing together too late, or too long from home after Lodge hours are past; and by avoiding of gluttony or drunkenness, that your families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working. (f) Behavior Toward a Strange Brother—You are cautiously to examine him, in such method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant false pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and deri - sion, and beware of giving him any hints of knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be relieved; you must employ him some days, or else recommend him to be employed. But you are not charged to do beyond your ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, that is a good man and true, before any other poor people in the same circumstances. Finally, all these charges you are to observe, and also those that shall be communicated to you in another way; cultivating brotherly love, the foundation and cap-stone, the cement and glory, of this Ancient Fraternity, avoiding all wrangling — 24 — — 25 —"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ANCIENT CHARGES and quarreling, all slander and backbiting, nor permitting others to slander any honest Brother, but defending his character, and doing him all good offices, as far as is consistent with your honor and safety, and no further.

No man can be made or admitted a mem - ber of a particular Lodge without previous notice one month before given to the said Lodge, in order to make due inquiry into the reputation and capacity of the candidate, unless by the dispensa - tion aforesaid. 6. But no man can be entered a Brother in any particular Lodge, or admitted to be a member thereof, without the unanimous consent of all the members of that Lodge then present when the candidate is proposed, and their consent is formally asked by the Master; and they are to signify their consent or dissent in their own prudent way, either virtually or in form, but with unanimity; nor is this inherent privilege subject to a dispensation; because the members of a par - ticular Lodge are the best judges of it; and if a fractious member should be imposed on them, it might spoil their harmony or hinder their free. dom, or even break or disperse the Lodge; which ought to be avoided by all good and true Brethren. 7. Every new Brother at his making is decently to clothe the Lodge, that is, all the Brethren pres• ent, and to deposit something for the relief of indigent and decayed Brethren, as the candidate shall think fit to bestow, over and above the small allowance stated by the By Laws of that particu. lar Lodge; which charity shall be lodged with the Master or Wardens, or the Cashier, if the members think fit to choose one. And the candidate shall also solemnly promise to submit to the Constitutions, the Chargas, the — 29— I"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"GENERAL REGULATIONS (Historical) GENERAL REGULATIONS (Historical) Regulations, and to such other good usages as shall be intimated to him in time and place con - venient. 8. No set or number of Brethren shall withdraw or separate themselves from the Lodge in which they were made Brethren, or were afterward ad - mittd members, unless the Lodge becomes too numerous; nor even then without a dispensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy; and when they are thus separated, they must either imme - diately join themselves to such other Lodge as they shall like best, with the unanimous consent of that other Lodge to which they go (as above regulated), or else they must obtain the Grand Master’s Warrant to join in forming a new Lodge. IF any set or number of Masons shall take upon themselves to form a Lodge without the Grand Masters Warrant, the regular Lodges are not to countenance them, nor own them as fair Brethren and duly formed, nor approve of their acts and deeds; but must treat them as rebels, until they humble themselves as the Grand Master shall in his prudence direct, and until he approve of them by his Warrant, which must be signified to the other Lodges, as the custom is when a new Lodge is to be registered in the list of Lodges. 9. But if any Brother so far misbehaves him - self as to render his Lodge uneasy, he shall be twice duly admonished by the Master or Warden in a formed Lodge; and if he will not refrain his imprudence, and obediently submit to the advice — 30— II II p I I of the Brethren, and reform what gives them of - fense, he shall be dealt with according to the By Laws of that particular Lodge, or else in such a manner as the quarterly communication shall in their great prudence think fit; for which a new regulation may be afterward made. 10. The majority of every particular Lodge when congregated, shall have the privilege of giving instructions to their Master and Wardens before the assembling of the Grand Chapter, or Lodge, at the three quarterly communications hereafter mentioned, and of the annual Grand Lodge too; bccause their Masters and Wardens are their representatives, and are supposed to speak their mind. 11. All particular Lodges are to observe the same usages as much as possible; in order to which, and for cultivating a good understanding among Freemasons, some members out of every Lodge shall be deputed to visit the other Lodges as often as shall be thought convenient. 12. The Grand Lodge consists of, and is formed by the Masters and Wardens of all the regular particular Lodges upon record, with the Grand Master at their head, and his Deputy on his left hand, and the Grand Wardens in their proper places, and must have a quarterly communication about Michaelmas, Christmas, and Lady Day, in some convenient place, as the Grand Master shall appoint, where no Brother shall be present who is not at that time a member thereof, without a —31 — I s~u~ me-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"GENERAL REGULATIONS GENERAL REGULATIONS (Historical) dispensation; and while he stays, he shall not be allowed to vote, nor even give his opinion without leave of the Grand Lodge asked and given, or unless it be duly asked by the said Lodge. All matters are to be determined in the Grand Lodge by a majority of votes, each member having one vote, and the Grand Master having two votes, unless the said Lodge leave any particular thing to the determination of the Grand Master for the sake of expedition. 13. At the said quarterly communication, all matters that concern the Fraternity in general or particular Lodges, or single Brethren, are quietly, sedately and maturely to be discoursed of and transacted; Apprentices must be admitted Masters and Fellow Craft only, here, unless by a dispensa. tion. Here also all differences that cannot be made up and accommodated privately, nor by a particu - lar Lodge, are to be seriously considered and de - cided; and if any Brother thinks himself ag - grieved by the decision of this buard, he may ap - peal to the annual Grand Lodge next ensuing, and leave his appeal in writing with the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or the Grand Wardens. Here also the Master or the Wardens of each particular Lodge shall bring and produce a list of such members as have been made, or even admitted in their particular Lodge since the last Communication of the Grand Lodge; and there shall be a book kept by the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or rather by some Brother whom the p p. I. Grand Lodge shall appoint for Secretary, wherein shall be recorded all the Lodges, with their usual times and places of forming, and the names of all the members of each Lodge; and all the affairs of the Grand Lodge chat are proper to be written. They shall also consider of the most prudent and effectual methods of collecting and disposing of what money shall be given to, or lodged with chem in charity, toward the relief only of any true Brother Fallen into poverty or decay, but of none else; but every particular Lodge shall dis - pose of their own charity for poor Brethren ac - cording to their own By Laws, until it be agreed by all Lodges (in a new regulation) to carry in the charity collected by them to the Grand Lodge at the quarterly or annual communication, in order to make a common stock of it, for the more hand - some relief of poor Brethren. They shall also appoint a Treasurer, a Brother of good worldly substance, who shall be a member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his office, and shall be always present, and have power to move to the Grand Lodge anything, especially what con - cerns his office. To him shall be committed all money raised for charity, or for any other use of the Grand Lodge, which he shall write down in a book, with the respective ends and uses for which the several sums are intended; and shall expend and disburse the same by such a certaii, order, signed, as the Grand Lodge shall afterward agree to in a new regulation; but he shall not vote in choosing a Grand Master or Wardens, though I — 32 — — 33 —"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"GENERAL REGULATIONS GENERAL REGULATIONS in every other transaction. As in like manner the Secretary shall be a member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his office, and vote in everything except in choosing a Grand Master or Wardens. The Treasurer and Secretary shall have each a clerk, who must be a Brother and Fellow Craft, but never must be a member of the Grand Lodge, nor speak without being allowed or desired. The Grand Master, or his Deputy, shall always command the Treasurer and Secretary, with their clerks and books, in order to see how matters go on, and to know what is expedient to be done upon any emergent occasion. Another Brother (who must be a Fellow Craft) should be appointed to look after the door of the Grand Lodge; but shall be no member of it. But these offices may be further explained by a new regulation, when the necessity and expediency of them may more appear than at the present to the Fraternity. 14. If at any Grand Lodge, stated or occa - sional, quarterly or annual, the Grand Master and his Deputy should both be absent, then the present Master of a Lodge that has been the longest a Freemason, shall take the chair and preside as Grand Master pro tempore, and shall be vested with all his power and honor for the time; pro - vided there is no Brother present that has been Grand Master formerly, or Deputy Grand Master; for the last Grand Master present, or else the last — 34— MI MI MI p p p Ii p I I I I I Deputy present, should always of right take place in the absence of the present Grand Master and his Deputy. 15. In the Grand Lodge none can act as War - dens but the Grand Wardens themselves, if present; and if absent, the Grand Master, or the person who presides in his place, shall order priv - ate Wardens to act as Grand Wardens pio tem - pore, whose places are to be supplied by two Fellow Craft of the same Lodge, called forth to act, or sent thither by the particular Master there - of; or if by him omitted, then they shall be called by the Grand Master, that so the Grand Lodge may be always complete. 16. The Grand Wardens, or any others, are first to advise with the Deputy about the affairs of the Lodge or of the Brethren, and not to apply to the Grand Master without the knowledge of the Deputy, unless he refuse his concurrence in any certain necessary affair; in which case, or in case of any difference between the Deputy and the Grand Wardens, or other Brethren, both parties are to go by concert to the Grand Master, who can easily decide the controversy and make up the difference by virtue of his great authority. The Grand Master should receive no intimation of business concerning Masonry but from his Deputy first, except in such certain cases as his Worship can well judge of; for if the application to the Grand Master be irregular, he can easily order the Grand Wardens, or any other Brethren -- 3~ — I"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"REGULATIONS GENERAL REGULATIONS (Historical) thus applying, to wait upon his Deputy, who is to prepare the business speedily, and to lay it orderly before his Worship. 17. No Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wardens, Treasurer, Secretary, or who - ever acts for them, or in their stead pro tempore, can at the same time be the Master or Warden of a particular Lodge; but as soon as any of them has honorably discharged his Grand Office, he returns to that post or station in his particular Lodge from which he was called to officiate above. 18. If the Deputy Grand Master be sick, ot necessarily absent, the Grand Master may choose any Fellow Craft he pleases to be his Deputy pro tempore; but he that is chosen Deputy at the Grand Lodge, and the Grand Wardens too, can not be discharged without the cause fairly appeat to the majority of the Grand Lodge; and the Grand Master, if he is uneasy, may call a Grand Lodge on purpose to lay the cause before them, and to have their advice and concurrence; in which case, the majority of the Grand Lodge, if they can not reconcile the Master and his Deputy or his Wardens, are to concur in allowing the Master to discharge his said Deputy or his said Wardens, and to choose another Deputy imme - diately; and the said Grand Lodge shall choose other Wardens in that case, that harmony and peace may be preserved. 19. If the Grand Master should abuse his power, and render himself unworthy of the obedi - — 36— a a N N IINI II. ence and subjection of the Lodges, he shall be treated in a way and manner to be agreed upon in a new regulation; because hitherto the ancient Fraternity have had no occasion for it, their form - er Grand Masters having all behaved themselves worthy of that honorable office. 20. The Grand Master, with his Deputy and Wardens shall (at least once) go round and visit all the Lodges about town during his Mastership. 21. If the Grand Master die during his Master - ship, or by sickness, or by being beyond sea, or any other way should be rendered incapable of discharging his office, the Deputy, or, in his absence the Senior Grand Warden, or, in his absence, the Junior, or, in his absence, any three present Masteas of Lodges, shall join to con - gregate the Grand Lodge immediately, to advise together upon that emergency, and to send two of their number to invite the last Grand Master to resume his office, which now in course reverts to him; or, if he refuse, then the next last, and so backward. But if no former Grand Master can he found, then the Deputy shall act as principal until another is chosen; or if there be no Deputy, then the oldest Master. 22. The Brethren of all the Lodges in and about London and Westminster shall meet at an annual communication and feast, in some con - venient place, on St. John Baptist’s Day, or else on St. John Evangelist’s Day, as the Grand Lodge shall think fit by a new regulation, having of late — 37 —"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"GENERAL REGULATIONS years met on St. John Baptist’s Day; provided, The majority of the Masters and Wardens, with the Grand Master, his Deputy, and Wardens, agree at their quarterly communication, three months before that there shall be a feast and a general communication of all the Brethren; for if either the Grand Master, or the majority of the particular Masters are against it, it must be dropped for that time. But whether there shall be a feast for all the Brethren or not, yet the Grand Lodge must meet in some convenient place annually on St. John’s Day; or if it be Sunday, then on the next day, in order to choose every year a new Grand Master, Deputy and Wardens. 23.

This committee must meet very early on St. John’s Day, at the place, even before any per - sons come with tickets. 26. The Grand Master shall appoint two or more trusty Brethren to be porters or doorkeepers, who are also to be early at the place, for some good reasons; and who are to be at the command of the committee. 27. The Grand Wardens, or the Stewards, shall apjoint beforehand such a number of Brethren to serve at table as they think fit and proper for that work; and they may advise with the Masters and Wardens of Lodges about the most proper persons, if they please or may take in such by their recommendation; for none are to serve that day but Free and Accepted Masons, that the communi - cations may be free and harmonious- 28. All the members of the Grand Lodge must be at the place long before dinner, with the Grand Master, or his Deputy, at their head, who shall retire and form themselves. And this done in order— (a) To receive any appeals duly lodged, as above regulated, that the appellant may be heard, and the affair may be amicably decided before dinner, if possible; but if it can not, it must be delayed till after the new Grand Master is elected; and if It can not be decided after dinner, it may be delayed, and referred to a particular committee, that shall quietly adjust it, and make report to the next quarterly communication, that brotherly love may be preserved. (b) To prevent any difference or disgust which may be feared to arise that day, that no interrup - tion may be given to the harmony and pleasure of the Grand feast. (c) To consult about whatever concerns the decency and decorum of the Grand assembly, and to prevent all indecency and ill manners, the assembly being promiscuous. (d) To receive and consider any good motion, or any momentous and important affair that shall be brought from the particular Lodges by their representatives, the several Masters and Wardens. 29.

The Master having signified his intention to proceed to the labors of the Lodge, every Brother is expected to assume his necessary Masonic cloth. ing, and, if an officer, the insignia of his office, and silently and decorously repair to his appro~ priate station or place. 2. The next step in the ceremony is, with the usual precautions, to ascertain the right of each one to be present. It is scarcely necessary to say that in the performance of this duty, the officers who are charged with it should ~llow no one to remain who is not either well known to themselves or properly vouched for by some discreet and ex - perienced member. 3. Attention is next directed to the external avenues of the Lodge, and the officers, within and without, who are intrusted with the perform - ance of this important duty, are expected to execute it with care and fidelity. 4. By a wise provision, it is no sooner intimated to the Master that he may safely proceed, than he directs his attention to an inquiry into the knowledge possessed by his officers of the duties — 46 — EM U I! 5” pm which they will be respectively called upon to perform. 5. Satisfied upon this point, the Master then announces, by formal proclamation, his intention to proceed to business; and after this no Brother is permitted to leave the Lodge during Lodge hours (that is, from the time of opening to that of closing) without having first obtained the Master’s permission. 6. Certain mystic rites, which can here be only alluded to, are then employed, by which each Brother present signifies his concurrence in the ceremonies which have been observed, and his knowledge of the degree on which the Lodge is about to be opened. 7. It is a lesson which every Mason is taught at one of the earliest points of his initiation, that he should commence no important undertaking without first invoking the blessing of Diety. Hence the next step in the progress of the opening cere - monies is to address a prayer to the Grand Architect of the Universe. This prayer, althouRh offered by the Master or Chaplain, is to be par - ticipated in by every Brother, and, at its conclu - sion, the audible response of ‘ISo mote it be” should be made by all present. 8. The Lodge is then declared, in the name of God and the Holy Saints John, to be opened in appropriate form, on the first, second or third degree of Masonry, as the case may be. — 47 — U"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS Before the Lodge is opened the Tyler should ascertain from the Master on which degree it is to be opened, and at request of the Senior Warden ~hou1d report to him as follows:— “Brother Senior Warden, all present are Mas - ter Masons, or Fellow Craft Masons, or Entered Apprentice Masons,” as the case may be. The representatives of the three Lesser Lights should be arranged in the form of a triangle, one at the east end and one at the west end of the north side of the Altar; the hird should be placed opposite the middle of the south side of the Altar. The Senior Warden’s column should be elevated and the Junior Warden’s column displaced when the Lodge is at labor on the Master Mason Degree. At all other times the Junior Warden’s column should be elevated and the Senior Warden’s displaced. At all times before the obligation the Senioi Deacon should walk at the right of the candidate. After the obligation he should walk at the left of the candidate - At all times except where otherwise indicated, offi - cers and membeis, in walking about the Lodge while it is in session, should turn square corners, and proceed clockwise except where inconvenient.

He should not answer a salute except in excusing some member from further attendance, or an officer upon retiring, or in recognizing a Brother who enters the Lodge while it is in session. When communicating the p ~w at the stations the Senior Deacon should step up to the level of the officer addressed, and, leaning forward, whisper it in his ear. The officer at the station should not stoop to receive it. In descending from the station the Senior Deacon should step back - ward. After the obligation in the E. A. and F.

Except where specifically authorized no abbre - viation of any of the degree work is permissible. Joking the candidate is a reprehensible Masonic offense and is absolutely prohibited. The Stewards are instructed to exclude from the preparation room all persons not engaged in pre - paring the candidate. They should instruct the candidate to give the knocks with his right hand.

A dispensation is an instrument emanating from the Grand Lodge, or from the Grand Master dur - ing a recess of the Grand Lodge, and in this juris - diction is signed by the Grand Master and attested by the Grand Secretary, with the seal of the Grand Lodge attached, empowering the Brethren therein named to initiate, pass and raise all good men and true who may apply for that purpose and whom they may find worthy, and to do certain other Ma - sonic work. A Charter is a similar instrument, is - sued only by the Grand Lodge while in session, and in this jurisdiction is signed by the Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, Senior and Junior Grand Wardens, and attested by the Grand Secretary, with the seal of the Grand Lodge attached, em- — 38 —- m mm mm mm mm powering the Brethren therein named and their successors to perform all regular Masonic work. Our ancient Brethren assembled on the highest hills and in the lowest vales, the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers. The form of a Lodge is oblong. It extends from east to west and between north and south, and it is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Masonr~ and to teach us that a Mason’s charity should be equally extensive, for n every country and in every clime are Masons to be found. A Lodge is metaphorically said to be supported by three great pillars, denominated Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, it being necessary that there should be wisdom to conceive, strength to sup. port and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. These pillars are represented in the Lodge by the Worshipful Master, the Senior and Junior Wardens. The covering of a Lodge is the clouded canopy or star-decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive by the aid of that allegorical ladder which Jacob in his vision saw, reaching from earth to heaven, the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope and Charity, which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity for all man - kind. The greatest of these is charity, for our faith may be lost in sight, hope ends in fruition, — 59 — mm"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE IN ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE but charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. Every well-governed Lodge is furnished with the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses. The Holy Bible is God’s inestimable gift to man, as the rule and guide of his faith; the Square is dedicated to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic Emblem of his office; and the Compasses to the Craft, for by due attention to their use we are taught to circumscribe our desires and keep our passions within due bounds toward all mankind. The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple, and is emblematic of human life, checkered with good and evil. The Indented Tessel is a repre. sentation of the beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded the pavement and is emblematic of the manifold blessings and com - forts which surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm reliance upon Divine Providence, hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. The Lights of the Lodge are three, situated in the east, west and south; and as you may observe, there is none in the north, because King Solomon’s Temple of which every Lodge is a representation, was situated so far north of the ecliptic that neither the sun nor moon at meridian height could dart its rays into the north part of the — 60 -- U U building. The north, therefore, among Masons, has always been termed a place of darkni~ss. The Jewels of a Lodge are six, three immovable and three movable. The Immovable Jewels are the Square, the Level and the Plumb; and they are termed immovable because they are the Jewels of the three principal officers of the Lodge, the Worshipful Master, the Senior and junior War - dens, who are always stationed in the east, west and south. The Square denotes morality, the Level equality, and the Plumb rectitude of life. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state. The Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the work - man, to be adiusted by the working tools of the Fellow Craft Mason. The Trestle Board is for the Master to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature, by the Perfect Ashlar of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle Board we are reminded that as the operative workman erects his temporal building according to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle Board, so should we, as speculative Masons, endeavor to erect our spiritual building 3ccording to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the — 61— U"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"BNTERBD APPRBNTICB DBGRBB BNTBRED APPRBNTICB DEGREB great book of nature and revelation, which is our spiritual, moral and Masonic Trestle Board. Lodges are situated due east and west, because Moses, after having been instrumental in con - ducting the Children of Israel through the Red Sea when pursued by Pharoah and his hosts, by divine command erected a tabernacle, which he placed due east and west, to commemorate the miraculous east wind by which their mighty de - liverance was wrought. This tabernacle was a model for King Solomon’s Temple, for which reason all Masonic Lodges should be situated due east and west. Lodges in ancient times were dedicated ~o King Solomon; but modern Masons dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, who were ~wo eminent patrons of Masonry; and, since their time, there should be represented ‘n every regular and well furnished Lodge, a cermin Point Within a Circle, embordered by two perpen - dicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist. Upon the top of the circle rests the Volume of the Sacred Law. The point represents an individual Brother, the circle the boundary line of his duty. In going around this circle, we necessarily touch upon the two parallel lines, as well as the Volume of the Sa - cred Law; and while a Mason keeps himself cir - cumscribed within their precepts it is impossible that he should materially err. rn I. Eq pq The three Principal Tenets of Masonry are Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. By the exercise of Brotherly Love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family—the high and the low, the rich and the poor—who, as created by one Almighty Parent and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support and protect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and causes true friendship to exist among those who might other - wise have remained at a perpetual distance. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sin - cere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our connections. Truth is a divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and with heart and tongue we join in promot - ing each other’s welfare and rejoice in each other’s prosperity. 19-31 * * * Temperance is that due restraint upon the affections and passions which renders the body —62 — —63 —"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"~NThRED APPRENTICE DEGREE ENTERED APPRENflCE DflGREB tame and governable, and frees the mind from the al1u~ements of vice. This virtue should be your constant practice, as you are thereby taught to avoid excess, or the contracting of any licen - tious or vicious habits, which might lead you to disclose some of those valuable secrets which you have promised to conceal and never reveal, which would consequently subject you to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons. 20-5 * * * Fortitude is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril or dangei- when prudently decmed expedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice, and, !ke the former vir~ tue, should be deeply impressed upon your mind as a safeguard or secutity against any illegal attack which may be made, by force or other - wise, to extort from you any of those valuable secrets with which you have been so solemnly intrusted, and which was emblematically rep - resented upon your first admission into the Lodge. 20.7 * * * Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions according to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by wbich we wisely judge and pru - dently determine on all things relative ~o our present as well as our future happiness. This virtue should be the peculiar characteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the world. You should be particularly careful — 64— m ‘N ir~ all s?range and mixed companies never to let fall the least sign, token or word whereby ~he secrets of Freemasonry might be unlawfully ob - tained. 20.9 * * * Justice is that standard or boundary of right which enables us to render unto every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with divine and human laws, but is the very cement and support of civil society, and, as justice in a great measure constitutes the really good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every Mason never to deviate from the minutes~ principles thereof. 20-11 * * * The earth is that alone of all the elements that has never proved unfriendly to man. The bodies of water deluge him with rain, oppress him with hail, and drown him with inundations. The air rushes in storms, prepares ~he tempest and fire lights up the volcano, but the earth, ever kind and indulgent, is found subservient to his wishes. Though constantly harassed more to furnish the luxuries then the necessities of life, she never refuses her accustomed yield, spreading his path with flowers and his table with plenty. Though she produces Poison, still she supplies the antidote and returns with interest every good committed to her care; and when at last he ~s called upon to pass through the dark valley of the shadow of death, she once more receives him and piously covers his remains within her bosom.

First, last and always, remember your obliga - tion as a Mason, any violation of which is a Masonic offense and may result in your suspen - sion or expulsion. It is also a Masonic offense with like penalties, to visit any clandestine body calling itself a Masonic Lodge, but not recog - nized as such by the Grand Lodge, or to converse on Masonic subjects with any member of such an organization; or to visit a Masonic Lodge whose charter has been suspended; or to solicit any person to apply for the degrees of Masonry; or to use any Masonic emblem on a business card or advertisement except for some legitimate Ma - sonic purpose; or engage in any business tending to corrupt public or private morals. Remember also that drunkenness, gambling, cheating, brawl - ing, profane swearing, or any other act in viola- p p p p p p p U tion of the laws of God or man, especially if it involves moral turpitude, is a Masonic offense. You are warned not to recommend anyone to a participation in our privileges unless you have strong reason to believe that he will ultimately reflect honor on our ancient Institution. You are also warned not to vouch for any person desiring to visit a Lodge unless you have U examined him strictly, under oath, and satisfied yourself that he is a Master Mason, or unless you have sat in a Lodge of Master Masons with him or have the positive and express guarantee that I he is a Master Mason from a Brother Master Mason known to you as such. When visiting an other Lodge, always have with you your last re - ceipt for dues or other documentary evidence I that you are a Master Mason in good standing, as required by Masonic law. Finally, remember always that the wearing of e Square and Compasses, or any other Masontc emblem, th by a man is no evidence that he is a Master Mason or that he ever saw the inside of a Masonic Lodge. There are in this and other states, and possibly throughout the world, spurious I and clandestine bodies claiming to be Masonic Lodges. You are enjoined to be continually on your guard against such persons, and if aproached Masonically by them to ignore them utterly.

Dedication is an ancient Roman word. It meant to give or consecrate something of value to the gods. Those who offered the gift relinquished all claim on it. Henceforth it was sacred. In dedicat - ing our new Lodge Room to Freemasonry, we should have in mind the ultimate thought of con. secrating and offering it to God. It should be a sacred place. Both in symbol and in ritual it should remind us that we are in His presence. We are serving God when we serve high ideals, when we rise from low, unworthy, selfish aims to thoughts of truth, purity and love. We do well to dedicate our Lodge Room. We should go farther and dedicate ourselves to God, which means that through faith in Him and love for Him we en - deavor to answer the prayer ‘Thy kingdom, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.” Who fails in this is not a perfect Mason. It is a good thing in a world full of the hurry and strife of business and the calls of flesh and vanity, to erect a Lodge Room as a witness to bet - ter things an4 a help to securing them. In a world in which there is a large measure of evil, it is well to build an Altar to God. If we then are truly ded - scated to God, we shall never enter the Lodge Room without a ptayer, nor engage in its ritual II p — 140 — without benefit, nor leave it without bearing a mes - sage of light to the world outside. General Directions The ceremony of dedication cannot be lawfully con - ducted except by the Grand Master in person, or by some Brother acting for him under special written authority. The ceremonies here laid down may be conducted either in public or in private. On the day appointed for the Dedication, the Grand Msster (or his Special Deputy) and his Officers, accom - panied by a sufficient number of Brethren (except the Deputy Grand Master, who presides in the Lodge Room until relieved by the Grand Master), meet in a conven - lent room, near the place where the ceremony is to be performed, and the Grand Lodge is opened on the Third Degree.

The most profound problem of human life, and the most pathetic cry of the human soul through - out the ages have been “If a man die, shall he live again?” and “Does his spirit live on eternally?” One subject on which Masonry sounds no uncer - tain note is the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. We have implicit faith that we shall meet again and be united with those we have long loved, and lost awhile. Our paths lead not to the grave, but through it. Today we seem to stand upon the shore of a great sea beyond which lies a land mysterious and silent. We see less and less distinctly the white sails of the ships that bear away from us to that other land, those who have grown so dear to us. There are no sails coming back across that sea with mes - sages of loving remembrance, but we know that a land of promise is there, and the God in whom we put our trust has impressed upon our souls the profound conviction that when we in our turn shall go away a~toss those waters, we shall then see and know again the loved ones who set sail before us. — 188 — I ONE OF THE FOLLOWING POEMS TO BE USED AT THIS POINT Sunset and the evening star, and one clear call for me, And may there be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea: Twilight and evening bell, and after that the dark, And may there be no sadness of farewell when I embark * * S Neaz shady wall a rose once grew, Budded and blossomed in God’s free light, Watered and fed by morning dew.

REPORT OF JURISPRUDENCE COMMITTEE AS A STATEMENT OF POLICY OF THIS GRAND LODGE To The Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Ac - cepted Mason of Oregon: Brethren: It is universally understood by Ma - sons that neither politics nor religion is to be dis - cussed in lodge. The questions propounded are, what is the meaning of these apparent probibi - tions. In order to answer those questions, it is necessary to go back so the source of the apparent restrictions and to try to ascertain what was meant by the language then used. This necessitates a con - sideration of the Ancient Charges. The first of these Charges, “Concerning God and Religion,” is as follows: “A Mason is oblig’d, by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid ATHEIST, nor an irreligious LIBERTINE. But though in ancient Times Masons were charg’d in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet ‘tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves; that is, to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Per - suasions they may be distinguish’d; whereby —227— p. I"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"STATflMflNT OF POLICY Masonry becomes the Center of Union, and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remain’d at a perpetual Distance.” The sixth of these Old Charges, “Of Behavior,” has six sub-headings. The second is “Behavior af - ter the Lodge is over and the brethren not gone. It reads as follows: “You may enjoy yourselves with innocent Mirth, treating one another according to Abil - ity, but avoiding all Excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occa - sion call him, or doing or saying anything of - fensive, or that may forbid an easy and free Conversation; for that would blast our Har - mony, and defeat our laudable Purposes. Therefore no private Piques or Quarrels must be brought within the Door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about Religion, or Nations, or State Policy, we being only, as Masons of the Catholick Religion above-mention’d; we are also of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds, and Languages, and are resolved against all Politicks, as what ever yet conduc’d to the Welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This Charge has been always strictly enjoin’d and observ’d; but especially ever since the Refor - mation in Britain or the Dissent and Secession of these Nations from the COMMUNION OF ROME.” — 228— rn p p p. p. p II II IN I STATflMflNT OF POLICY Still another of these Charges should be consid - U ered in our quest for their meanings. Of these Charges, the second is entitled “Of the Civil Mag. istrate Supreme and Subordinate.” It reads: “A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concern’d in Plots and Conspira - cies against the Peace and Welfare of the Na - tion, nor to behave himself undutifully to in - ferior Magistrates; for as Masonry hath been always injured by \\X’ar, Bloodshed and Confu - sion, so ancient Kings and Princes have been much dispos’d to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their Peaceableness and Loyalty, whereby they practically answer’d the Cavils of their Adversaries, and promoted the Hon - I our of the Fraternity, who ever flourish’d in Times of Peace. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State, he is not to be coun - tenanc’d in his Rebellion, however, he may be I pitied as an unhappy Man; and, if Convicted of no other Crime, though the loyal Brother - hood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political I Jealousy to the Government for the time be - ing; they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his Relation to it remains indefeasible.” These Ancient Charges first found Masonic pro - nouncement, if not recognition, as a part of Ander - son’s Constitutions, in 1722. About the time these Constitutions were being formulated, Samuel — 229 — I"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"STATEMflNT OF POLICY Johnson was compiling the first English diction - ary. Fortunately, that monumental work is avail - able. From it we learn that religion was defined thus: “(1) virtue, as founded upon reverence for God - - - -; (2) a system of divine faith and worship - - - - .“ And “politick” thus: (1) politi - cal, civil; (2) prudent, versed in affairs; (3) artful, cunning.” Time, erosian, many wars and much bloodshed have not changed these meanings very much. The term “religion” is defined by Webster’s New International Dictionary as “the outward act or form by which men indicate their recognition of the existence of a god or of gods having power over their destiny, to whom obedience, service and honor are due; the feeling or expression of human love, fear or awe of some superhuman or over - ruling power, whether by profession of belief by observance of rites and ceremonies, or by the con - duct of life; a system of faith and worship; a manifestation of piety - - The Standard Dictionary gives the following definitions: “Political, (1) pertaining to public policy; concerned in the administration of govern - ment; belonging to the enactment and administra - tion of the laws; as political management; political system; (2) belonging to the science of govern - men!; treating of polity or politics; as political principles; (4) pertaining to or connected with a party or parties controlling or seeking to control government in a state; as political methods, a po - litical campaign.” — 230— p I STATEMENT OF POLICY “Politics” is defined by the same work as fol - lows: “(1) the branch of civics that treats of the principles of civil goversurient and the conduct of st ate affairs; the administration of public affairs the interest of the peace, prosperity and safety S the state; statecraft, political science, in a wide sense embracing the science of government and civil polity; (2) political affairs in a party sense, e administration of public affairs or the conduct • I political matters so as to carry elections and secure public offices, party intrigues, political wire- pulling, trickery.” p. 1! p I p. “U’ Iii ‘U’ Now, with these excerpts from the ancient charges and these definitions before us, let us con - sider our problems. First. What is the meaning of this prohibition against discussing religion? Does it put a ban on all religious discussion? We here quote a brief excerpt from an address delivered by Melvin Maynard Johnson, Past Grand Master of Massachusetts and Soverign Grand Commander of the Ancient, Accepted Scot - tish Rite, Northern Masonic Jurisdiction, delivered before the Grand Lodge of Indiana in May of 1948: “Those things about which we can differ in religion were forbidden to be discussed within the Lodge but there is nothing in Anderson’s Constitutions, if you consult the dictionaries of that day and the oldest one is the dictionary of Samuel Johnson, which was being prepared — 231 —"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"STATEMBNT OF POLICY STATEMENT OP POLICY at about the time that Anderson’s Constitu - tions were written—if you consult that, you will find the definition of general religion, which is a thing we not only may discuss within the Lodge but you never attended a Masonic Lodge where it wasn’t discussed. You never attended a Masonic Lodge, which was a recog - nized Masonic body, which wasn’t either op - ened by a declaration to the glory of the Grand, Architect of the Universe, or by prayer to Him that He would guide us in our delib - erations, or both. There isn’t a degree in sym - bolic Freemasonry that isn’t based upon be - lief in one single, powerful, dominating, lov - ing Father, who is the Creator and the God of us all. We certainly are not forbidden by An - derson’s Constitutions to discuss that kind of religion and if we omit that there will be no ritual left. The whole basis of our getting to - gether is, that in every nation and by every sea where some great mind has led the thoughts of men away from their own imagin - ings and properly pointed out to them that from which we came and that to which we go —in every such land men believe in God by whatever letters His name may be spelled in that land or however His name may be pro - nounced. Certainly Freemasonry not only does not forbid the discussion of that religion but there would be no such thing as Free - masonry without such discussion in every meeting of a lodge.” — 232 — The charges say “ - - -- and if he rightly un - derstands the Art, he will never be a stupid atheist nor an irreligious libertine.~~ How is he to attain this true understanding of ehe Art that he may avoid these pitfalls if nothing of a religious character can be mentioned? Again, “ ‘Tis now thought expedient only to oblige them to that religion in which all men agree Here we have then the key to the true meaning of this Ancient Charge. It requires a belief in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man; to this belief, all men worthy of our fraternity can certainly subscribe. Let us continue, “ - - - - leaving their particular opinions to themselves; that is to be good men and true, or men of honour and honesty, by whatever denominations or persuasions they may be dis - tinguished; Again, “ - - - - therefore no private Piques or Quarrels must be brought within the Door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about Religion, or Nations, - - — Here again is the key to the prohibition we are considering. Sectarianism is what is prohibited. In other words, according to this Ancient Charge, there is no place in Masonry for an “atheist” nor an “irreligious libertine,” but by it a Mason is ad - monished to have a belief in God. How he is to worship is not the business of Masonry, and its — 233 — q"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"STATEMENT OP POLICY discussion is prohibited. This metbod of worship is, by this fiat of Masonry and, in the United States, by our Constitution, left to the dictates of each individual member’s conscience. We call it religious liberty. Second. Now let us consider the prohibition against political discussion. The importance, as well as the acuteness, of this question, is empha - sized by Mackey. We quote from that eminent Masonic scholar and authority as follows: “There is no charge more frequently made against Freemasonry than that of its tendency to revolution, and conspiracy, and to political organizations which may affect the peace of society or interfere with the rights of govern - ments. It was the substance of all Barruel’s and Robinson’s accusations, that the Jacob inism of France and Germany was nurtured in the Lodges of those countries; it was the theme of all the denunciations of the anti- Masons of America, that the Order was seek - ing a political ascendancy and an undue influ - ence over the government; it has been the unjust accusation of every enemy of the Insti - tution in all times past, that its object and aim is the possession of power and control in the affairs of state. It is in vain that history records no instance of this unlawful connec - tion between Freemasonry and politics; it is in vain that the libeler is directed to the An - cient Constitutions of the Order, which ex - pressly forbid such connection; the libel is still -~ 234— STATEMENT OP POLICY written, and Freemasonry is again and again condemned as a political club.” We think it must be admitted that Masonry is i-oneerned with the public policy of our nation and of the world. Prudence is a cardinal virtue. How may a Mas - ter Mason emulate this virtue or be “versed in affairs” without some discussion of “the science of government”, the “principles of civil govern - ment”, “political science”, etc.? Quoting from the second Charge: “A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works, and is. never to be concern’d in Plots and Conspira - cies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation.” In order to be such citizen, he must be intelli - gent, he must be informed. These ends are attained by discussion, by study, that the member may avoid being a “stupid fool.” The more we study this subject, the more it becomes apparent that this prohibition, like the prohibition against a discussion of religion, is not all.inclusive, that it has its limitations, that it is not intended to prohibit a discussion of things po - litical in the broad meaning of that term but only things political in the narrow sense. As we have pointed out, the prohibition against religious discussion was intended to apply to sectarianism so this prohibition against politi - cal discussion was intended to apply to par- — 235—"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"STATEMBNT OP POLICY tisan politics, not to the science of government. Certainly no one would contend that a study of and speeches about the Great Light would be pro - hibited as a religious discussion; and by the same token, a study of and speeches about our Consti - tution are not prohibited as political discussion. But what about Communism? Must we remain silent while it demolishes our sacred institutions? Section II of the Communist Manifesto of 1848, as edited in 1888 by Engels, declares: “There are besides, eternal truths — such as freedom, justice, etc., that are common to all states of society; but communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; Fortunately, this question has been answered in this jurisdiction. In 1937, M. W. Brother R. Frank Peters, in his address to the Grand Lodge, made this statement: “Masonry takes no part in politics. It is right that it should not. Neither should it permit discussions of political matters concerning which there can be an honest difference of opinion among Masons. Such discussion would only lead to dissension. “But as to those forms of government or po - litical systems concerning which there is no room for difference of opinion among Ma - sons, a different situation exists. We have a right to discuss them within the lodge. I refer — 236 — hi hi IN I,’ N I I I STATEMBNT OP POLICY to those forms of government or political sys - tems which do not permit or tolerate Masonry. “During the year~ I have talked in the lodges throughout this Jurisdiction against those sub - versive influences which, if permitted to go unchallenged, might eventually gain control in this country and destroy our liberties, our free institutions, and our Masonry. “If to talk against these sinister influences which are gradually boring into our govern - ment, our educational institutions, our patri - otic organizations, and our fraternities consti~ tutes the talking of politics, then let us to that extent get into politics. “If Masonry is worth maintaining, worth hav - ing, it is worth fighting for, even if we have to go into politics for that purpose. If we have any stamina, any virility, we ought to fight those things which are trying to destroy Masonry. If we do not, we may awake too late to find Masonry in this country in the same condition that it is in Russia, Germany, and Italy today.” This part of the Grand Master’s address was referred to the jurisprudence committee, and the jurisprudence committee made the following re - port: “TO THE GRAND LODGE OF ANCIENT FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS OF OREGON: “We, your Committee on Jurisprudence, to h I h I — 237 —"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"STATEMENT OP POLICY STATEMENT OF POLICY whom was referred that portion of the Grand Master’s Address entitled ‘Masonry and Poli - tics, are of the opinion that the Grand Master is to be commended for his uncompromising stand against those subversive influences which if permitted to go unchallenged, might destroy our liberties, our free institutions, and our Maso4ry. “We recommend that it be declared to be the sense of the Grand Lodge that there is no inhibition in Masonry against the expression in the lodge of opinions antagonistic to those forms of government or political systems which are hostile to Masonry or its principles and that it behooves all Masons to be eternally vigilant against all enemies of Masonry and all enemies of our government of Constitu - tional limitations. Respectfully submitted, Earl C. Bronaugh, Carl C. Donaugh, Percy R. Kelly, Wallace McCamant, Walter C. Winslow Jurisprudence Committee” This report was adopted by the Grand Lodge. We have given very careful consideration to the question and feel that the declaration of the then Grand Master, the report of the then jurispru - — 238— dence committee and the action of the Grand Lodge adopting the same constitute a clear, well- defined, firm declaration of policy upon this sub - ject, to which we whole-heartedly adhere. The purpose of Masonry is to make its votaries wiser and better and consequently, happier. We make them wiser, as far as the science of govern - ment is concerned, by study and discussion of po - litical science; and we make them better by a study and discussion of the fundamental, under - lying basic principles of religon, or morality if there is a distinction. In both fields, the rule and its limitation may be thus summarized; We may discuss those mat - ters concerning which there can be no honest dif - ference of opinion; as to matters and systems con - cerning which there can be honest differences of opinion among Masons, a different situation exists. This includes sectarianism and partisan politics. Discussion of these is prohibited. This conclusion is not out of harmony with the declarations of principles announced by the Grand Masters Conference of 1939 from which we quote the following: “8. To that end, it preaches and stands for the worship of God, truth and justice; frater - nity and philanthropy; and enlightenment and orderly liberty, civil, religious, and intellectual. It charges each of its members to be true and loyal to the government of the country — 239 —"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"STATflMflNT OF POLICY to which he owes allegiance and to be obedient to the law of any state in which he may be.” Masonry is not a crusading institution. It takes no part in public or private campaigns of any kind. It makes no public appearances, except on state occasions (laying cornerstones, etc.) and for bury - ing its dead. This does not mean that it is not interested in the community or what is going on in the community, nor that it does not influence the affairs of man; but it does all this by strenRth - ening and refining individual character, by teach - ing and discussing the eternal verities, by promot - ing and stimulating the brotherhood of man based upon the Fatherhood of God. The foregoing will answer all but borderline cases. If the borderline case presents itself spon - taneously within the constituent lodge, the Master shall determine the matter in conformity with the principles herein enunciated. If it arises by virtue of a prepared address, the matter should be sub - mitted to the Grand Master. Respectfully submitted, Walter C. Winslow, Chairman Clarence D. Phillips R.
