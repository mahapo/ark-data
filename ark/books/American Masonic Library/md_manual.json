The greatest of these is Charity; for ou~r Faith may be lost in sight, Hope ends in fruition, but Charity extends beyond the grave through the boundless realms of Eternity. FURNITURE. The furniture of a Lodge is th~ Holy Bible, the Square, and the Compasses. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God; the Square to the Master; and the Compasses to the Craft. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man * * * * *; the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Comv~sses to the Craft, because, by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe their desires and keep their pasasions within due bounds.

TENETS OF PROFESSION. The Tenets of our profession are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. BROTHERLY LOVE. By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family; the high and low, the rich and poor, who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same pJanet, are to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might other - wise have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF. To relieve the distressed is a duty in - cumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection.

On this basis we form our friendships and establish our con - nections. TRUTH. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry.- On this theme we contem - plate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct: hence, while in - fluenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us, sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and in rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. POINTS OF ENTRANCE. THE FOUR CARDINAZ VIRTUES Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice, TEMPERANCE. Temperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions which renders the body tame and governable, and frees FIRST U~GREE ‘9 the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be your constant- practice, as you are thereby taught to avoid excess, or contracting any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence of which might lead you to disclose some of those valuable secrets which you have promised to conceal and never reveal, and which would consequently subject you to the contempt and detestation of all good Masons * * * * * FORTITUDE. Fortitude is that noble and steady pur - pose of mind whet eby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril or danger, when prudentially deemed expedient.

Masonry is here considered under two denominations: operative and specu - lative. OPERATIVE MASONRY. By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength, and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and con - venient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demon - strates that a fund of science and in - dustry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. SECOND DEGREE 27 SPECULATIVE MASONRY. By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice chat ity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligation to pay that rational homage to the Deity which. at~once con - stitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of creation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfection of his Divine Creator. *** ** PORCH, PILLARS.

ITS ANTIQUITY. From the first formation of society order in Architecture ma~’ be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn ~that they ‘first planted trees on end and then laid others across to suppoit a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom, are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more im - proved art of Architecture. The five orders are thus classed: the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. ORDERS MOST REVERED. The ancient and original orders of Architecture revered by Masons are no more than three: the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two: the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric; and the Coin - posite, which was more ornamental if not 7 Seckor~.

The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally; the Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state, and the Composite is the Corinth - ian enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, are we indebted for what is great, ju - dicious, and distinct in Architecture. THE FIVE SENSES OF HUMAN NAFURE. Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. The ~rst three are most revered by Masons. * * * * * THE SEVEN LIBERAZ ARTS AND SCIENCES. Grammar, Rhetoric, Logk~, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. The fifth.— Geometry, is most revered by Masons. Geometry treats of the powers and properties of magnitudes in general, where length, breadth, and thickness are SECOND DEGREE considered, from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, and from a super - ficies to a solid. A point is a dime usion - less figure, or an indivisible part of space. A line is a point continued, and, a figure of one capacity; namely, length. A superficies is a figure of two dimen - sions; namely, length and breadth. A solid is a figure of three dimensions; namely, length, breadth, and thickness. THs~ ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY. By this Science the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general to arrange his soldiers; the geographer to give us the dimensions of the world and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms, and provinces. By it, also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations, and to fix the duration of time and seasons, years and cycles. In one, Geometry is the foun - dation of Architecture and the root of the mathematics. * * OUTER DOOR.

THE MORAr. ADVA1~FAGES OF GEOM - ETRY. Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis upon which the superstructure of Masonry is erected. By Geometry we may curiously trace nature through her various windings to her most concealed recesses. By it, we may discover the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which connect this vast machine. By it, we may discover how the planets move in their different orbits, and demonstrate their various revolu - tions. By it, we account for the retain of seasons and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the dis - cerning eye.

A survey of nature and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the Divine plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to society and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works which are the admira - tion of every age. ~ The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spa - cious and magnificent and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force.

Brother Being passed to the Second Degree of Masonry, we congratulate you on your preferment. The internal, and not the external, qualifications of a man are whal Masonry regards. As you in - crease in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which as a Mason you are bound 10 discharge, or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experi - ence must have established their value. Our laws and regulations you are strenu - ously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. Von are not to palliate or aggravate the offences of your brethren, but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friendship, and repre - hend with justice. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch o~ education which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration, es - pecially the science of Geometry, which is established as the basis of our art. Geometry or Masonry, originally synon - ymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge. While it proves the wonderful properties of nature, it de - monstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular de - portment have merited the honor which we have now conferred; and in your new character, it is expected that you will conform to the principles of the Fra - ternity by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue.

Man that is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with Thee; Thou hast appointed his bounds that be cannot pass, turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish his day. For there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down, and riseth not up again till the Heaven shall be no more. Yet, 0 Lord! have compassion on the children of Thy creation: administer them comfort in time of trouble, and save them with an everlasting salvation. Amen. So mote it be. THIRD SECTION.
