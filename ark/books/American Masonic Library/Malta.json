[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Malta      1 4/15/2003 Pro Given prior to the start of the Order. The Order of Malta in the York Rit e system serves as the preparatory degree for the fusion of two great institutions – Ancient Craft Masonry and Christianity. This Order originated in the 11 th Century, A.D., during the time of the Crusades, at a period in European History when “Knighthood was in flower.” Christianity, by tat time having spread and gained a strong foothold throughout Europe and the British Isles, had a particularly strong appeal to the nobility as well as to the common ma sses. For the Knight of that period saw in the life, work and teachings of Jesus, the self sacrifice, the helpfulness to the weak and t he oppressed, the glad, willing and consecrated service to God and man which should characterized true knighthood. In other words, they found Jesus to be the mirror of chivalry, the ideal pattern of the true kni ghtly, valiant and magnanimous life. The Order was originally established to give protection and assistance to pilgrims on their journey to visit t he scared places of the Holy Land. So effectively did these Knights perform their tasks, they not only gained the respect, the admiration and the support of the heads of governments, but also the support of the heads of governm ents, but also the support of the Church and the blessing of Popes. The Orders grew and prospered in both fame and fortune and Priories were eventually established throughout Christendom. During the centuries that followed, they led a turbulent existence by becoming involved, of necessity, in the quarrels of Emperors and Popes and in the various religious wars which erupted from time to time. A more detailed account of their history will be revealed as you pass through the ceremonies of the Order. We have learned that Ancient Craft Ma sonry does not concern itself with sectarian religion – it only demands the belief in a Supreme Being. Since Masonry requires a belief in God and Christianity also demands a belief in God, it follows that these two great institutions have much in common. In uniting the two the York Rite still adheres tone of the greatest tenets of Masonry by refusing to make any distinction among Christians of any particular sect or creed. Christian Masonry is concerned with the humble, whole-hearted, devoted and consecrated service to God and man as exemplified in the life, work and teachings of Jesus and is not concerned with the intellectual acceptance of any system of doctrines or dogmas. It is Christianity in its purest and simplest form – unbiased and unprejudiced.

The history of this Ancient and Chival ric Order is closely associated with the history of medieval Europe and the Near East from the 11 th to the 16 th centuries. During that period Empire s rose and fell, many political and religious wars were fought and the Order, being religious in character and dependent upon governments for support and assistance, was directly affected by the fortunes of Emperors and Popes and led a turbulent and sometimes precarious existence; being forced to evacuate its home on several occasions and seek to establish itself in another location. The dates and names on the different ceremonial banners indicate the times and locations where the Order es tablished itself during those years of sojourning. It is worthy to note that the Passwor ds on the banners, while expressive of events in the history of the Order, also indicate the important periods and events in the life of Jesus. Bir This Order was founded at Jerusalem in the year of our Lord 1099, by the association of a number of pious Kn ights with the fraters of St. John’s Hospital, an establishment previously formed for the relief of pilgrims who had come to worship at the Holy Sepulcher. The name and date upon the white banner, “Birth,” “Palestine, 1099,” commemorates the country of our Savi or’s nativity; the place where the Order was founded, and the first epoch in its history. Lif After a troubled existence of two hundred years I the Holy Land, and being deprived by the wars raging in Europe of needed and looked for assistance, the Order was compelled to evacuate Palestine, and in 1287 it established itself on the Island of Cyprus, and settled in Limisso. The name and date upon the red banner, “Life,” “Cyprus, 1287,” commemorates the second place of their sojourning, and the second epoch in their history. De In 1310, the Island of Rhodes became t he property of the Order by right of conquest from the Saracens. Here they established themselves so firmly that they were able to maintain their possession form more than two hundred years, and the remains of the fortifications erected there by the Knights, still bear testimony to their engineering skill and ability. In 1522 the Island of Rhodes was besieged by the Turks, and after a memorable defense, their fortifications being reduced to ruins, scarcely one stone remaining standing upon another, they were compelled to surrender and evacuate the island. For the next seven years the Order ceased to exist as a sovereign power. Hence the name and date, “Death,” “Rhodes, 1310” upon the black banner. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Malta      19 4/15/2003 Res From 1523 to 1530 the remnants of the Order wandered from place to place without a home. They went first to the Island of Candia where they attempted to reunite and reestablish themselves as a sovereign power. Hence the name and date, “Resurrection,”, “Candia,” 1523 upon the purple banner. Asc In 1530, after seven years of homeless wanderings, the Island of Malta was ceded to the Order by the Emperor, Charles V, upon condition that they would defend it and repress the rav ages of the Moorish rovers who at that time infested the southern ports of the Mediterranean Sea. Accordingly they took possession of the Island, became known as “Knights of Malta”, and rose to their greatest heights of power and influence. Hence the name and date, “Ascension,” “Malt a, 1530” on the yellow banner. Mar The legend connected with the approach of the Knights to their final and most renowned abiding place has given rise to the distinguishing Sign and Word of the Order. The tradition is, that on coming to take possession of the Island, the Knights approached the shore in their Galleys, two men to an oar, the oars in their left hands and their swords in their right hands, singing a psalm as they rowed, in t hese words, “Rex Regum et Dominus Doominorum” – “King of Kings and Lord of Lords”. The Islanders, seeing them approach in this warlike m anner, hailed them through a speaking trumpet, saying in the Arabic language: “Ah tie toom bis sah Lamh?” (“Do you come in peace?”) To which the Knights responsed in the same tongue, “Ah tie nah bis sah lahm”. (“We come in peace.”) Then the Islanders responded: “Fa two bis sah lahm.” (“Then come in peace.”) It is worthy of note that these words or substantia lly the same, are the common form of salutation between an Arab and a st ranger at the present day. The Mediterranean Pass, which you received in the introductory degree of Knight of St. Paul, tradition informs us , was instituted at an early period of the Order to enable pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land to recognize each other, and as a protection against the Moorish rovers who infested the Mediterranean Sea and Palestine. There exists within the Order as it has developed, two ceremonials – the American ceremonial and the European ceremonial – and the tables, pointing to them, one in the East, the other in the West represent the presentation of union between the two.

This is symbo lic in a degree of the Christian character of the Order. The number five also symbolically reminds us of the passion of our Blessed Saviour, and of His five wounds upon the Cross.

There are eight Knights seated at the table in the West. According to the European Ceremonial, these Knights ar e officers of the Priory. They represent the eight languages into wh ich the Order was formerly divided, which were: Provence, Auvergne, Fr ance, Italy, Aragon, Germany, Castile, and Anglo-Bavaria. The table at which these Knights are seated has depicted upon it a large Maltese Cross, on the center of which is a circle, divided into four equal quartering by two transverse bars crossing each other at right angles in the center. Each of the four quarters of the circle has a figure depicted upon it. A ship or ancient galley. A ladder, with five rounds or steps, with the letters B, L, D, R, A, one on each step, and a speaking trumpet. A hand and a serpent. A human skull, cloven in twain from the top with a double-edged sword, and a spear beneath it. The galley reminds us of the maritime character of the ancient Order, both in war and commerce. The letters on the steps of the ladder correspond with those of the five ceremonial banners, and are the initial letters of the passwords on those banners. The hand and serpent reminds us of the history of St. Paul in connection with the Island of Malta. The human skull, cloven by the two- edged sword, reminds us of the penalty that was inflicted upon traitors to the Order in ancient times. The spear again reminds us of the passion of our Blessed Savior, for with such an instrument they pierced his side."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Malta      21 4/15/2003 Mar I will now direct your attention to the Grand Banners of the Order, of which there are two: the Banner of St. J ohn, and that of Malta.

StJ The Banner of St. John is red, havi ng painted upon it a white Greek Cross, the bars of the Cross extending to the edge of the banner, and on the center of the Cross a “Paschal Lamb.” The letters F, E, R, T are also on the banner, one in each quarter. These are the initial letters of the four words in the Latin sentence, “Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit”, which in English is “His courage preserved Rhodes.” According to a tradition of the Order, these letters upon the banner had their origin during the Grand Mastership of Villeret, early in the fifteenth century. In 1415 the Turks laid si ege to Rhodes, the new home of the Order, and were repulsed by the brav e Christian Knights. Amadeus V, Duke of Savoy, having rendered timely and valuable assistance to the besieged Knights Hospitalers during th is attack, the Grand Master, in commoration thereof, caused the letters to be added to the Banner of St. John. The descendents of the Duke Amadeus have, since that time always borne on their shield a white cross, with the word FERT as a device; the word being composed of the initial lette rs of the Latin words, as before described.
