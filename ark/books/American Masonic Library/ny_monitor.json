Freemasonry is far removed from all that is trivial, selfish, and ungodly. Its structure is built upon the ever - lasting foundation of that God-given law, the brother - hood of man in the family whose Father is God. Our ancient and honorable Fraternity welcomes to its doors and admits to its privileges worthy men of all creeds and of every race, yet it insists that all men shall stand upon an exact equality and receive its instruction in a spirit of due humility, emphasizing, in demeanor, in conduct, in ceremony, and in language, the helpless groping na - ture of man at his birth, and his need of reliance upon Divine guidance throughout life, You will here be taught to divest your mind and conscience of all the vices and superfluities of life, and the Lodge into which you are now to be admitted expects you to divest yourself of all those distinctions and equipments which are not in keep - ing with the humble, reverent, and childlike attitude it is now your duty to assume, as all have done who have gone this way before you” The candidate shall thereupon, previous to his reception, be asked the following questions, to which he is required to give his full assent: 4 THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE 1. Do you declare, upon your honor, that, unbiased by the improper solicitation of friends, and uninflu - enced by mercenary motives, you freely and voluntar - ily offer yourself a candidate for the Irlysterics of Freemasonry? 2.

And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

The representatives of the three Lesser Lights are three burning candles, or tapers, placed upon candlesticks or pedestals, situated East, West, and South. I particularly direct your attention to the Great Light in Masonry, the Holy Bible. Howsoever men differ in creed or theology, all good men are agreed that within the covers of the Holy Bible are found those principles of morality which lay the foundation upon which to build a righteous life. Freemasonry, therefore, opens this Book upon its Altars, with the command to each of its votaries that he diligently study therein to learn the way to everlasting life. Adopting no particu - lar creed, forbidding sectarian discussion within its Lodge rooms, encouraging each to be steadfast in the faith of his acceptance, Freemasonry takes all good men by the hand, and, leading them to its Altars, points to the open Bible thereon, and urges upon each that he faithfully direct his steps through life by the Light he there shall find and as he there shall find it. If, from our Sacred Altars, the atheist, the infidel, the irreligious man, or the libertine, should be able to wrest this book of Sacred Law, and thus remove, or even obscure, the greatest Light in Masonry, that Light which for centuries has been the rule and guide of Free - masons, then could we no longer claim for our- 6 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MON[TOR OF THE WORK THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE selves the great rank and title of Free and Ac - cepted Masons; but, so long as that Sacred Light shines upon our Altars, so long as it illuminates the pathway of the Craftsman by its golden rays of truth, so long, and no longer, can Freemasonry live and shed its beneficent influence upon man - kind.

The Common Gavel is an instrument used by operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the build - er’s use; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spirit - ual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.

We read in the Book of Ruth concerning their manner of changing and redeeming, that “To confirm all things, a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor.” That was testimony in Israel. This, therefore, we do, testifying thereby in the strongest manner possible the sincerity of our intentions in the work in which we are engaged. * * * * “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” * * * * Before entering upon any great or important undertaking we ought always to invoke the aid of Deity. The right hand, by our ancient brethren, was deemed the seat of fidelity. The ancients wor - shipped a diety named Fides, sometimes repre - sented by two right hands joined, at others by two human figures holding each other by the right hand. The right, I herefore, we use in this great and important undertaking, testifying thereby in the strongest manner possible the fidelity of our purposes in the work in which we are engaged. * * * * The lamb, in all ngcs, has been deemed an em - blem of innocence.

THIRD SECTION This brings us to the third and last section of the degree, which explains the nature and prin - ciples of our constitution. Here, too, we receive instruction relative to the form, supports, cover - ing, furniture, ornaments, lights, and jewels, of a Lodge; how it should be situated, and to whom dedicated. A Lodge may be defined as a certain number of Free and Accepted Masons, duly assembled, furnished with the Holy Bible, Square, and Com - passes, together with a Charter or Dispensation from some Grand Body of competent jurisdiction empowering it to work. THE CHARTER The Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses have been partially explained to you; the Charter has not. It pleased the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York, over which body the Most Worshipful Grand Master, at pf~sent presides, to grant to this Lodge the Charter now in its possession, empowering it to confer the three degrees of Masonry, which power we are now partly exer - cising. 12 13"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE LODGES, WHERE HELD Our ancient brethren held their Lodges on high hills or in low vales the better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, ascend - ing or descending. Lodge meetings, at the present day, are usually held in upper chambers, probably for the better security which such places afford. The custom may have had its origin in a prac - tice observed by the ancient Jews when building their temples, schools, and synagogues, on high hills, a practice which seems to have met thi~ ap - probation of the Almighty, who said unto the Prophet Ezekiel, “Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof, round about shall be most holy.” FORM The form of a Lodge is oblong, in length from east to west, in breadth between north and south, as high as Heaven and as deep as from the surface to the center. It is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Freemasonry, and teaches that a Mason’s charity should be equally extensive. SUPPORTS A Lodge is supported by three great pillars, denominated Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty; for there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn, all great and im - portant undertakings. They are represented by - the three principal officers of the Lodge; the pillar Wisdom, by the Worshipful Master in the East, who is presumed to have wisdom to open and govern the Lodge; the pillar Strength, by the Senior Warden in the West, whose duty it is to assist the Worshipful Master in the discharge of his arduous duties; the pillar Beauty, by the Junior Warden in the South, whose duty it is to call the Craft from labor to refreshment, super - intend them during the hours thereof, carefully to observe that the means of refreshment are not perverted to intemperance or excess, see that they return to their labor in due season, that the Worshipful Master may receive honor, and they pleasure and profit, thereby. COVERING The covering of a Lodge is no less than the clouded canopy, or starry-decked Heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by aid of that ladder which Jacob in his vision saw extended from earth to Heaven, the principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope and Charity, which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of immortality, and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is Charity. For Faith may be lost in sight, Hope end in fruition, but Charity extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. FURNITURE Every regular and well-governed Lodge is fur- ‘4 15"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE nished with the Holy Bible, Square, and Com - passes, together with a Charter, or Dispensation. The Holy Bible is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of Cod to man, and on it we obligate our newly made brethren; the Square to the Worshipful Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office; and the Compasses to the Craft, for, by a due attention to their use, we are taught to cir - cumscribe our desires and keep our passions in due bounds. ORNAMENTS The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosalc Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the In - dented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, check - ered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel, or tesselated border, of the manifold blessings and comforts which constantly surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm reliance on Divine Providence, which is represented by the Blazing Star in the center. LIGHTS A Lodge has three symbolic Lights, situated East, West, and South. Thc North we Masonic- ally term a placo of daikncss. JEWELS A Lodge has six Jewels, three movable and three immovable. The Immovable Jewels are the Square, the Level, and the Plumb. They are so termed be - cause they are appropriated to particular parts of the Lodge where they should be found, the Square to the East, the Level to the West, and the Plumb to the South. The Square teaches morality, the Level, equal - ity; and the Plumb, rectitude of conduct. The Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar, and the Trestle-Board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone in its rude and natural state, as taken from the quarry; the Perfect Ashlar, one prepared by the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of Felloweraft; and the Trestle-Board is for the Master Work - man to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of that rude and imperfect state which is ours by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of Deity. And as the operative workman erects his temporal building in accordance with the designs laid down upon the Trestle-Board by the Master Workman, so should we, both operative and speculative worl~men, en - deavor to erect our spiritual building in accord - ance with the designs laid down by the Supreme l6 17"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE Architect of the Universe in the great Book of Revelation, which is our Masonic Trestle-Board. HOW SITUATED A Lodge is situated due east and west, because King Solomon’s Temple was so situated. Moses, by Divine command, having conducted the children of Israel out of the Land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, through the Red Sea, into the wilderness, erected a Tabernacle to God, which he situated due east and west, to com - memorate to the latest posterity that miraculous east wind which wrought their mighty deliverance. Ki~ig Solomon’s Temple is said to have been a representation of that Tabernacle. TO WHOM DEDICATED Anciently, Lodges were dedicated to King Solomon, as he is said to have been our first Most Worshipful Grand Master; but speculative Masons dedicate theirs to the memory of St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist. Since their time, there is represented, in every regular and well-governed Lodge, a certain point within a circle, the point representing the individ - ual brother, the circle, the boundary line of his conduct to God and man, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, prejudices, or inter - ests to betray him. This circle is bordered by two perpendicular parallel lines representing these Saints, and upon the vertex rest the Holy Scrip - tures, which point out the whole duty of man. In going around this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures, and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially err. PRINCIPAL TENETS The principal Tenets of our profession are three - fold, including the inculcation and practice of those truly commendable virtues, Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the human race as one fan~ily, the high, the low, the rich, the poor, who, created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabiting the same planet, should aid, support, and protect one an - other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and promotes true frien~Iship among those who might otherwise have remained perpetually at a distance. To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, particularly upon Masons, who are linked together by a chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with them in their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, are aims we have in view. On this basis, we establish our connections, and form our friendships. 19 18"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. Hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us; sincer.ity and plain deal - ing distinguish us; and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity. * ~E * * Fortitude is that noble and steadfast purpose of the mind, whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril, or danger. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice, and should be deeply impressed upon your mind as a safe - guard or security against any attempt that might be made, by force or otherwise, to extort from you any of the secrets with which you have been so solemnly intrusted. This virtue was emblemat - ically represented upon your first admission into the Lodge * * * * Prudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the dictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge and determine on all things relative to our present, as well as our future happiness. This virtue should be your characteristic, not only in the government of your conduct while in the Lodge, but also when abroad in the world. You should be particularly cautious, in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall thc least sign, token, or word, whereby the secrets of Freemasonry might be obtained * * * * Temperance is that due restraint upon the passions which renders the body tame and gov - ernable, and frees the mind from the allurements of vice. This virtue should be your constant prac - tice, as you are thereby taught to avoid excess, and the contracting of any licentious or vicious habit, the indulgence of which might lead you away from the path of righteousness and cause you also to disclose those secrets which you have promised to conceal and never reveal, the betrayal of which would subject you to the contempt of all good Masons * * * * Justice is that standard which enables us to render to every man his due, without distinction. This virtue is not only consistent with Divine and human law, but is the very cement and support of society: and, as justice, in a great measure, dis - tinguishes the good man, so should it be your practice to be just * * * * Entered Apprentices should serve their Masters with freedom, fervency, and zeal, which are em - blematically represented by chalk, charcoal and clay. There is nothing freer than chalk, the slightest touch of which leaves a trace; there is nothing more fervent than charcoal, for to it, when prop - erly ignited, the most obdurate metals will yield. 20 21"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MONITOR 01’ THE WORK THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE There is nothing more zealous than clay, our mother earth, for it, alone of all the elements, has never proved unfriendly to man.

And when at last we are called upon to pass through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, she once more receives us, and tenderly enfolds our remains within her bosom, thus admonishing us that, as from earth we came, so to earth we must surely return. CHARGE As you are now introduced into the first prin - ciples of Freemasonry, I congratulate you upon being accepted into this ancient and honorable Fraternity—ancient as having subsisted from time immemorial, honorable as tending in every par - ticular so to render all men who conform to its precepts. No institution was ever raised upon a better principle, or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men, in all ages, have been encouragers and promoters of the art, and have ncvcr dccmcd it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, extend its privileges, and patronize its assemblies. There are three great duties, which, as a Mason, you are charged to inculcate—to God, your neigh - bor, and yourself. To God, in never mentioning His Name save with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator, imploring His aid in all your undertakings, and esteem - ing Him as the Chief Good; to your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you; and to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intem - perance, which may impair your faculties, or de - base the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet and peace - able citizen, true to your government and just to your country. You are not to countenance dis - loyalty or rebellion, but are patiently to submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor, be particularly care - ful to avoid censure or reproach. Although your frequent appearance at our reg - ular meetings is earnestly solicited, yet it is not mcant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument 22 23"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK THE DEGREE OF ENTERED APPRENTICE with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule or defame it. During your leisure hours, that you may sm- prove in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well-informed brethren, who will be always as ready to gve as you will be to receive instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolate the principles of the Fraternity, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into Masonry, be particularly care - ful not to recommend him, unless you are con - vinced that he will conform to our rules, so that the honor, glory, and reputation of the Institution may continue firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. CHARGE Whatever may hitherto have been your moral attitude towards the God of man, you, by your voluntary action this evening, have proclaimed openly your belief that He really is, and rightfully rules. The title—”Brother”—is Masonically given be - cause of His Fatherhood. You have now entered upon a new tie with Him; you look up to Him as our Fralernity’s God. As such you have, at yonder Altar, sworn in His Name and asked His help to be an upright man and Mason. That means your duty to Him, and duty means a debt. I know not your former estimation of the rev - erence due to Him. [do know that from this time forth your oath of allegiance demands steadfast fealty to His laws, and extreme reverence for His Holy Name. The world itself styles him who knows no God a heathen. He is a menace to society and a moral blank in himself. The Mason who acknowledges God in the Lodge-room and ignores or blas - phemes Him out of it sins and violates his oath. Your Masonry must be proven by your real at - titude towards our Supreme Grand Master. The tongue, which takes the obligation of the Mason, should not demean the Mason’s God. Resent the curse against your Father in Heaven as you would resent a curse against your father on earth. Strive to be a Mason who will fashion bravely his loyal sonship. Care little for the jibes of men, but heed the sting of conscience. Go out from this evening’s ceremonies a loyal Mason, a worthy brother, an Apprentice entered upon a new field of labor, with a new sense of duty, and bound by a solemn vow ever to walk and act uprightly, and speak reverently of God, before whom all Masons humbly and devoutly bow. 25"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE DEGREE OF FELLOWCRAFT THE U~EGREE OF FELLOWCU~AIT FIRST SECTION THE SCRIPTURE LESSON Amos, vii, 7, 8. 7 Thus He shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in His hand. 8 And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou?

The second section of this degree also refers to the origin of the Jewish Sabbath, as well as to the manner in which it was kept by our ancient brethren. In six days God created the Heaven and the earth, and rested on the seventh day. The seventh, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labor. * * * * THE PILLARS The chapiters were ornamented with leaves of lily-work, net-work, and chains of pomegranate. The Lily, from its extreme whiteness, as well as the retired situations in which it grows, denotes Peace; the Net-work, from the intimate connec - tion of all its parts, Unity; and the Pomegranate, from the exuberance of its seed, Plenty.

THE THREE STEPS * * * * THE FIVE STEPS * * * * By order in Architectute is meant a system of all the members, proportions, and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrange - ment of the projecting parts of a building, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect, and complete whole. From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, 28 29"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and, from this simple hint, originally pro - ceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders of ancient classic architecture are the Doric, the Ionic, the Corinthian, the Tuscan, and the Composite. The Done, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornament~ on base or capital, except mouldings, though the frieze is distinguished by triglyphs and metopes, and triglypha compose the ornaments of the frieze. The solid com - position of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are desired. The Done is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural position of solid bodies. The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and the more delicate orders. Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with vol - utes, and its cornice has dentils. There are both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians. The famous temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was of this order. The Corinthian, the richest of the five orders, is deemed a masterpiece of art. Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves, and eight volutes, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devices, the cornice with dentils and modillions. This order is used in ornate structures. The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany, whence it derives its name. Its column is sevcn diameters high; and its cap - ital, base, and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would bc supcrfluous. THE DEGREE OF FELLOWCRAFT The Composite is compounded of the other orders and was contrived by the Romans. Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has quarter-rounds, as have the Tus - can and Done orders; it is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentils. or simple modilLions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance, and beauty are displayed. The more ancient and original orders of archi - tecture revered by Masons are three: the Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian, which were in - vented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two, the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which is more ornamental than the Corinthian. In more modern times our operative brethren invented and perfected a new school of architec - ture, the Gothic, which endures, a thing of beauty, unsurpassed in the builders’ art. The five human senses are Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting, the first three of which have ever been deemed prerequisite * * * * THE SEVEN STEPS allude to the seven Liberal Arts and Sciences which are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Music.

CHARGE Upon the very name of this degree is based the charge which now the instructive tongue conveys to the attentive ear, with the hope that it may be lodged within the faithful breast. Fellowcraft— the craft of fellow-workmen. In the providence of God, wilh the breath of life each of us became a member of the human family. In maturity we stand facing the needs and responsibilities of life. As Fellowcrafts, we face our duty to our neighbor. God never brought us into being to live in the narrow groove of a selfish individualism, but as brethren one of an - other in mutual dependence and support. Nothing does the Holy Bible, the rule and guide of our faith and practice, more strenuously teach; noth - ing does Masonry more inflexibly demand. No household can fashion the home where dissension and selfishness knell the death of unity and peace. No community can protect character where petty strife is born of mischievous tongues. No city can become a place of prosperous growth whose citizens care little and do Jess for its advancement. No state can derive the benefit of its own re - I sources whose people obey but the one law of in - dividual inclination and greed. No government can stand firm whose adherents are blind to the unalterable law, “in union is strength, in harmony is peace.” Although but one man among many, you cannot escape or shirk your share in this great responsibility. Your personal contact with others may be circumscribed by the limit of the circle within which your daily life is lived; but your influence, passing through and from those whom that circle may surround, will reach further than you can conceive.

The high honor and distinguished privilege of performing this sacred service was denied to David, King of Israel, because, as the Scriptures inform us, he had made great wars and shed blood abundantly. We also learn from the same sacred source that the God of Israel had promised David that out of his loins He would raise up seed to serve Him. This divine and memorable promise was afterwards fulfilled in the person of Solomon, and in his splendid and un - exampled career of prosperity. After David had been gathered to his fathers, and the last honors paid to his memory, Solomon wielded the scepter of Israel, peace reigned within her borders, and the children of Israel looked forward with peculiar satisfaction for the display of that wisdom which was destined to astonish and amaze the world. In the second month of the fourth year of his reign, Solomon commenced the erection of this edifice, the curious workmanship of which was calculated to excite the wonder and admiration of all succeeding ages. It was located on Mount Moriah, near the placc where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and where David a ‘1 met and appeased the destroying angel, which was visible over the threshing-floor of Ornan, the Jebusite. About this time, King Solomon received a congratulatory letter I~ * * * offer - ing him every assistance in his power, and mani - festing a strong desire to participate in the high honors then clustering around the Throne of Israel.

All these were classed and arranged in such manner, by the wisdom of King Solomon, that neither envy, discord, nor confusion interrupted or dis - turbed the peace and good fellowship which pre - vailed among the workmen. * * * * EMBLEMS The Three Pillars were explained in a preced - ing degree, and there represented Wisdom, Strength and Beauty.

I’ * * * * SEVEN * * * * FIVE * * * * THREE The Three Steps usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, youth, manhood, and age. In youth, as Entered Apprentices, we should occupy our minds in the attainment of useful l~nowledge; in manhood, as Fellowcrafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our duties to God, our neighbor, and ourselves; so that in age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflection conscquent upon a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, always an acceptable offering to Deity, and as this glows with heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to our Creator for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. The Bee Hive is an emblem of industry, teach - ing the practice of that virtue to all men. As we came into the world rational and intelligent be - ings, so should we ever be industrious, never con - tent to be idle, while our fellow creatures are in want, if it is in our power to relieve them. When we take a survey of nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless than the brute creation. He lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for himself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the in- clemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Creator of Heaven and earth to make man independent of all other beings, but as de - pendence is one of the strongest bonds of society, men were made dependent on one another for protection and security, whereby they enjoy better opportunities to form the ties of love and friend - ship. Thus was man formed for social and active life, the noblest work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to endeavor to add to the common stock of knowledge and understand - ing, may be deemed a useless member of society, unworthy of our protection as Masons.

The Anchor and the Ark are emblems of a well- grounded hope, and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that Divine Ark, which bears us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and the Anchor, which shall safely moor us in the peace - ful harbor where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. The Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. The Hour-glass is an emblem of human life. Behold how swiftly the sand runs and how rap - idly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot without astonishment behold the little particles in the device; how they pass away almost impercept - ibly, and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they are all exhausted. Thus wastes man! Today, he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; tomorrow, blossoms, and bears his honors; the next day comes a frost which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his greatness is still aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mothe~ earth. The Scythe is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold what havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race! If by chance we should escape the numerous ills incident to child - hood and youth, and with health and vigor attain the years of manhood; yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us. * * * * * * * CHARGE Your zeal for the Institution of Masonry, the progress you have made in the mystery, and your conformity to our regulations, have pointed you out as a proper object of our favor and esteem.

There is no strained reversal of order in this, nor does Masonry differ with nature or revelation in her sequence of teaching. God comes first always, for in Him we live and move and have our being. Our neighbor comes second because God Himself has so ordered in those ten greater Command - ments written with His own finger of Divinity. We ourselves, come last because without duty to God we should lack the strength to perform, and without duty to our neighbor we should lack the Golden Rule, which shows us the duty we owe to ourselves. Your manhood does not depend upon your position, but upon your character. The establishment as well as the acknowledgment of true manhood is in your own hands. Too many think that reputation ensures it; do not wait for that. Seek the true definition of a man and then exemplify it. Do not have two characters, one for your fellows and another for privacy. Be a true man in your own home as well as out in life. Scorn to debase yourself because the door of pub - licity is locked. Let even your own solitude keep company with the gentleman within it. Speak the same language to men that you do to your mother. Look upon women as you would have other men look upon your sisters. Resent the unclean speech as a challenge against your claim to good breed - ing. Demand respectful treatment from your neighbor, but first command your own self- respect.

The honor, reputation, and usefulness of your Lodge will depend upon the skill and ability with which you manage its concerns. As Master of this Lodge, it will be your duty to preside over and direct its ceremonies, preserve the ancient landmarks of the Fraternity, and permit no innovation in its principles or rites. Upon all suitable occasions remind the brethren that Masonry is founded upon the great moral principles set forth in the Sacred Volume, which we receive as the rule and guide for our faith and practice. Exhort them to govern themselves by these principles, as well with the world at large as with each other. Teach them to reverence the Three Great Lights—the Holy Bible, the perfect Square, and the extended Compasses—the sym - bolisms of which are familiar to you, and embrace the most important duties inculcated by our Fraternity. The leading objects of our Fraternity are to promote morality, to keep men honest and up - right, true to their GOD, and faithful to their country, and to unite them by the strong bonds of charity, friendship, and brotherly love. Great care, therefore, should be taken in admissions to membership, lest by the introduction of bad ma - terial the Fraternity be corrupted. It should ever be borne in mind that the respectability and use - fulness of a Lodge depend not on the number, but on the character, of its members. 87"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK iNSTALLATION OF LODGE OFFiCERS It is better that no workman be added to the roll than that one unworthy be permitted to cross the threshold of the Lodge.

Brothers Senior and Junior Warden, to you are committed the pillars of strength and beauty. [t is your duty to set before the brethren the Corn of Nourishment, the Wine of Refreshment, and the Oil of Joy, symbols of the moral lessons of our Fraternity, taught from your stations in the Lodge. In your own persons you should give evidence that you are governed by the principles of the Fraternity, as it is only by a due regard for them in your own lives and conduct that you may expect regard for them in others. You are to assist the Worshipful Master in the discharge of his trust, diffusing light and im - parting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of the Worship - ful Master, you will succeed to higher duties; your acquirements must, therefore, be such that the Craft may never suffer for want of proper instruc - tion.

I charge you, that you act worthy of your voca - tion as Freemasons and suffer no fault on your part to tarnish the lustre of your calling, or bring discredit on the Craft. Recommend Masonry to the world by the rectitude of your conduct. To this end make yourselves intimately acquainted with its principles and obligations, and practice in your lives its duties. Divest yourselves of cold - ness and apathy, fatal to your best interests Shun those affections and passions unworthy of a soul claiming affinity with the “Sons of Light”; put forth all your energy to grasp what is noble and elevating in thought and action and capable of furthering our Fraternity’s lofty destiny.

The roots of Freemasonry are lost in antiquity, but our recorded history extends backward well over six hundred years. We would have you know, then, that Freemasonry is a moral institution [ounded on the Father - hood of God and the brotherhood of man. It is not just social, not merely ritualistic, but is also educational and patriotic. Con - trary to the belief o[ many in the past, it is not a secret society. We do have a few signs and words of recognition which we like to keep to our - selves, but Freemasonry itsel[ is not secret. The whole world is aware of it. The Square and Compasses are known and re - spected froln pole to pole; no effort is made to hide its existence. Masons are proud to be known as such. Masonry teaches no secret truth, the mysteries of Masonry are only such as those eternal truths upon which it is built and which are common to all men, those of faith and duty, of life and death. Rather, then, it is a private Society 93"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"set apart from the gossip and chattei of life, where reverence, friendship and love teach manhood and character.building which can endure.

Nor let us forget that our Fraternity is intensely patriotic; and though definitely not a religion, it is religious in that it urges every man to be steadfast in the faith of his acceptance. Most of the world has now come to know that a Masonic Temple is a gathering place of men who believe in God and Country, men who uphold the prin - ciples and ideals revealed in the Book of the Law — ideals which America has always exemplified. The installation of officers of a Lodge is of great importance; and Masonry teaches that before entering upon any great or important undertaking, we should invoke the blessing of the Supreme Archi - tect of the Universe. Let us all stand and give our attention to the Chaplain, after which we will pledge allegiance to the Flag of our Country, followed by one verse of the National Anthem. Prayer by the Chaplain Eternal Source of Life and Light, we, Thy servants, reverently bow before Thee in adoration and praise. As when we first saw the light at our Altar, we first im - plored Thy guidance, protection and aid, so now we seek Thee for Thy divine bless - ing and direction.

To attend regularly the communications of his Lodge. This duty is so plain as hardly to need a comment. Few things weaken and demoralize the Lodge so much as the Master’s frequent absence. 2. To convene his Lodge, set it to work, and give it proper instruction for its labor. The Master is the judge of the emergency that may require a special or called meeting, and without his con - sent, except at the times br Stated or Regular Com - munications, the Lodge cannot be Convened. 3. To open his Lodge at the time specified in the By-laws, and close it at a suitable hour. It is proper here to remark that th~e Master who would have a successful administration should never fail to open the Lodge at the time specified in the by-laws, for by first fulfilling the law himself, he can with better propriety demand its fulfillment at the hands of the other members. The Master is the sole judge of the time to close the Lodge, but communications should not be unduly prolonged. 4. To preserve order in the Lodge. His very name, Worshipful Master, suggests the au - thority with which he is invested to keep order. The Gavel, placed in his hand when he was installed, is an emblem of power and control, and if properly wielded will insure cheerful obedience and secure perfect order and decorum. 98 99"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK 5. To regulate the admission of visitors. One of the duties of the Master is the preserva - tion of harmony among the brethren by the exercise of vigilance against the admission of cowans, or of those brethren who would by theji presence disturb the peace of the Lodge and hinder its work. In the discharge of this duty the Master should exercise his prerogative and refuse admission to any visitor whose presence would be objectionable to any mem - ber It would be a poor incentive to peace and har. mony to admit one who would cause offense. 6. To preserve peace and harmony in the Lodge, and by his deportment both in his Lodge and out of it, to set an example to his brethren. The Master should impress upon the members of his Lodge the dignity and high importance of Mason - ry, admonish them never to disgrace it, charge them to practice out of the Lodge those duties which they have been taught in it, and by amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct, convince mankind of the excellence of the Institution, so that, when any one is said to be a Freemason, the world may know that he is one to whom mankind mdy pour forth its sorrows, to whom distress may proffer its suit, whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence. 7. To be the custodian of the-Charter of the Lodge, and transmit it to his successor. At his installation the Master receives in charge the Charter of his Lodge, which is by him transmitted to his successor in office Under its authority alone can the Lodge be organized, and its presence is necessary to the legality of all meetings. It is his duty .carefully to preserve it, as its loss would cause serious inconvenience. 8. To render the ritualistic work 9 f the Lodge and instruct the brethren therein. The Master should be in fact master of the work, competent to render its every part. I hi -1 :1 4;j 4-i II DUTIES OF WORSHIPFUL MASTER 9. To exercise s~ipervision over the minutes, that nothing improper be recorded, and nothii*t, essential to a complete record be omitted. 10. To sign ~Il dralts upon the Treasurer for the payment of Lodge disbursements when aut=’ - orized by vote of the Lodge. Nor may the Treas - urer lawfully pay out funds without such order. It is usual to give the Master authority to appro - priate, in emergent cases of charity, small sums, with - out taking the consent of the Lodge, but for all other disbursements the treasury of the Lodge can only be opened by Lodge order. To visit the sick. The cause to be made an investigation into all unmasonic conduct on the part of members of his Lodge, of non-affiliates and members of other Lodges resident within his jurisdiction. j4 100 101"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"____ I — WEN~OEATEVES OF TH~ WORSHIPFUL MASTER By the prerogatives of the Worshipful Master are meant the inherent right and authority he possesses by reason of the position he occupies, giving him, as it does, extraordinary powers and privileges, which belong to the presiding officer of few other associations. In all instances his de - cision on points of order is final in the Lodge, for it is a settled principle of Masonic law that no appeal can be taken to the Lodge from the decision of the Master. Grand Lodge, or the Grand Master, alone, can overrule his decision on any point of order. The prerogatives of the Worshipful Master are so numerous and varied that only some of the principal ones are here presented. 1. To preside at all communications of his Lodge. This is self-evident, and follows as a natural con - sequence of his installation. There is this peculiarity attached to the Master of a Masonic Lodge; when once duly installed, he cannot resign nor can he be deprived of his right to preside, by any power re - siding in the Lodge itself. He is bound, however, to pay homage to the Grand Master; hence, when the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or other duly appointed representative, appears in the Lodge, the right of thc 102 41 PREROGATIvES OF WORSHIPFUL MASTER Master to preside temporarily disappears, unless the superior authority waives the right. The Master may call upon a Warden or an ex - perienced Past Master to preside, but he remains responsible to Grand Lodge for the proceedings, as fully as though he held the gavel in person. He may resume the East at any moment, in his discretion. In his absence, the Senior Warden opens, and pre - sides over, the Lodge. In the absence of both the Master and the Senior Warden, these powers devolve upon the Junior Warden. In the absence of all three, the Lodge cannot be opened, and in all cases the Lodge cannot legally be opened unlc~s the Charter is present. 2. To fill temporarily all vacancies that may occur in the Lodge offices, As it is his duty to set the Craft at work, it is necessary that he have the active cooperation of all the officers, and if any are absent he has full power to select from the Brethren present such as he may deem competent to discharge the duties. There is no advancement by right. If the Senior Warden is absent, the Jun’ior Warden does not ex-officio fill the West. The Master appoints a Senior Warden pro tern. 3. To control and terminate discussions. This right is not to be exercised in a haughty, arbitrary, or dictatorial manner, but with determina - tion to administer impartial justice, to the end that the peace and harmony of the Lodge may be preserved, and its prosperity secured. This prerogative is a land - mark essential to the position of the Master and is the only method by which he can sustain himself in his responsibility to Grand Lodge; and, happily for his position, it is one that rarely will bring him into conflict with his brethren, while the good sense of obedience, inculcated in every degree of Masonry, bends the minds of the brethren to support the Master in his judicious exercise of power. It is his right to discuss all questions without leaving the Chair. 103"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"j4 MONITOR OF THE WORK 4. To determine all questions of order, and what business shall be brought before the Lodge. 5. To select the appointive officers of the Lodge. 6. To appoint all committees. 7. To order the issuance of notifications to members. The distinction between A “Notification” and a “Sum - mons” is so great that it is strange how many overlook it The former issues from the Master of the Lodge, and is practically an Invitation. It is at the option of the brother receiving it to attend the meeting or not, as he plcases. But a “Summons” comes directly under the province of his OB , and for its neglect he may be disciplined and punished To disobey a sum - mons is a serious Masonic offense. 8 To give the casting vote in case of a tie, provided he has not already voted. This is limited, however, to votes taken viva voce, or by upraised hands. The Master may vote upon ordinary questions or not, as he chooses, but it is not usual for him to do so. Upon questions requiring the ballot he should always vote On queltions, if there is a tie,.he should break the tie by his vote. 9. To represent the Lodge in Grand Lodge. 10. To install his successor. This prerogative not being a duty, it is always competent for a retiring Master to select a well qualified Master or Past Master to conduct the ceremonies of installation. ii W1NEU~AL ~U~VUCE Grand Lodge at its One Hundred and seventy- fourth Annual Communication (1955) approved the printing of this Funeral Service and a Com - mittal Service. The question is frcquently asked whether a Masonic funeral scrvice may be conducted for an unafliliated or a nonaffiliated brother. Section 367 of the Constitutions provides: “The brother so unaflilialed shall not be allowed to visit any Lodge nor join in a Masonic procession, nor be entitled to receive Masonic relief or burial.” Should a request for a Masonic funeral service be made to the Lodge, by the family, of the de - ceased for an unafliliated, or a nonaffiliated brother, the Master may at his discretion grant the request It is permissible for a Master, if he so decides to conduct funeral services for an Entered Ap - prentice or Fellow Craft if he or his family mdi- (ate a wish that this be done The task of conducting a Masonic funeral ser - vice is one for Master Masons only Should the service be for an Entercd Apprentice or for a Fellov~ Craft, no Entered Apprentice clothed as such and no Fellow Craft clothed as such, is to he a participant in the service 105 I (II"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"MONITOR OF THE WORK GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR BURIAL SERVICE GENERAL DIRECTIONS “On the death of a member of the Lodge, it is the duty of the Master of that Lodge to acquaint the next of kin with the right of the deceased to a M~isonic funeral service If the Master receives .i request that the brother be buried with the ceremonies of the Craft, he will consult with the family, ~iscertarn the time and place of the service and issue his order to the Secretary to notify the Lodge An emergent communication may be called; or the brethren requested to assemble at the place where the services will be held. Mem - bers of other Lodges attending will assemble with the members of the Lodge performing the service Should a Lodge receive a request from the family of a deceased sojourner, the Master imme - diately will communicate with the Master of the Lodge of the deceased, offering to conduct or to assist him in conducting the service. If the deceased was a Grand or Past Grand Lodge Officer, the Officers of Grand Lodge should be invited. The Grand Master, if present, may exercise his prerogative and conduct the service The clothing to be worn at a Masonic funeral should be conservative, with white gloves and white aprons. Regardless of the rank of the de - ceased or of any brother attending the services, no aprons or jewels are to be worn other than the white apron. The Officiant should not wear a hat. Should an emergent communication be called, it must be held in the Lodge Room. The Master will open the Lodge on the Third Degree of Masonry and state the purpose of the communl - cation.

When a number of Lodges join in a funeral procession, the position of the youngest Lodge is at the head of the procession and the position of the oldest is at the end. The Lodge of which the deceased was a member always has the place of honor. A Lodge in procession is to observe the dis - cipline of the Lodge room. No brother will enter the procession or leave it without permission of the Master. The following rule covers the committal service only: On arriving at the entrance of the cemetery, the brethren will march in open order to the tomb or the grave. If the body is to be placed in a tomb, the Tiler will take his place in front of the open door, and the lines will spread to form a square.

The Committal will be pronounced. After the coffin has been placed in the tomb, the Stew - ards will cross their rods over the door and the Deacons over the Officiant. If the body is to be deposited in a grave, a square should be formed around it and the coffin placed on the rests over the grave. The Stewards will cross their rods over the foot and the Deacons cross theirs over the head, and retain this form to the conclusion of the committal service - At a Masonic service where the Amerlcan Flag is on the coffin, the Flag should first be folded back, the Masonic Apron placed upon the coffin and the Flag returned to its position covering the coffin and the Apron The sprig of acacia is also to be placed under the Flag.

When Masons enter a place of mourning, they should do so with all the dignity and decorum required of the occasion. Care should be taken while the brethren are gathering that loud talking be kept at a minimum. Plans for regalia and paraphernalia should be made well in advance, and the person re - sponsible for them should be present ahead of time so that there be little or no confusion in distribution and preparation. It is not necessary to memorize the service. Clergy of all faiths usually read the funeral service. Is is advisable however that the officiant be one who is well acquainted with the service. It might be well to have two or three men who would always be available. They should be good readers and have clear voices. Such a person may be the Worshipful Master, a clergyman, or some other brother in the Lodge—a calm and assured attitude in both voice and bearing is important for the officiant. We must remember that this is one of the few tunes Masons perform in public. We want to leave a message that is wrapped in dignity. We want the loved ones of our beloved brother to know that he walked with men and Masons. Remember while we may be pained and grieved at the loss of a brother, we are in the presence of those whose loss is heavier than Ours and who need the comfort that can only come through a display of love and affection. To avoid any interruption in the tone set by the ofliciant, it is suggested that the officiant be responsible also for the prayers instead of using a Chaplain. The Chaplain may be the officiant The officiant should stand at the center of the coffin, or beside the urn, picture, or other memento, facing the audience, with the Junior Warden on his left and the Senior Warden on his right. The Senior Warden should hold the apron or lambskin; the Junior Warden should hold the sprig of acacia. When the words are recited by the officiant for the placing of the apron. the Warden is to hand it to the officiant or place it upon the coffin, or the urn. picture. or other memento. The same procedure should be followed feir the sprig of acada. It is further suggested that when the brethien assemble, they do not close ranks blocking out the view of the audience. The formation of brethren on either side should be in single, double or triple lines. If the number of Masons present is too numerous, it might be desirable that only a reasonable nuniber take their positions while the others aptead out through the Chapel When the final part of the ceremony takes place and the brethren file past the coffin, or the urn, picture. or other memento, those who are not in formation max loin the line. No sprig of acacia is to be used and no words aie to be spoken by the brethren These sugges - tions are all made with the purpose of creating an atmosphere of revesence at a time when it is soreh needed Masonry gives every deference to a man’s religion. Where a combined Masonic and religious service is to be conducted, the Masonic service should precede the religious service. It is suggested that when both Masonic and religious seivices are to be held, the Masonic service be conducted on the evening before. When the biethren are assembled, the services will begin as follows: One or more of the following verses out of the Holy Bible may be read. This is optional.

Help us to look beyond the darkness and sadness of this moment to the light and hope of tomorrow. Thou knowest we are weak and un - able to stand alone. Fill us then with the power and comfort of Thy pres - ence that we may say with assurance “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord.” Amen. “So Mote it Be”.

But God in His infinite mercy has given us the greatest gift of all—the ability to reach into the inner recesses of our souis. Arid from that depth within each of us we have always found the strength that sustains us even in the darkest and most difficult moments. This is the birthplace of the world’s greatest literature, music and art. So we can say with certainty “Just as surely as the questions of fear and doubt arise in our minds—so comes the assurance that life does not end with death.” The history of man and our pres - ent experiences in life bear testimony: That man is a citizen of two worlds: That only Eternity can fulfill the dreams and hopes and ideals with - in each of us; That a life time on earth is not enough; That God in His infinite wisdom has plans far beyond our compre - hension—plans that could not end in death. It is the hope and the faith which sustains us, that dispel the fears which surround us in death.
