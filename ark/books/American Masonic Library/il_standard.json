OF ITS ANTIQUITY From the first formation of society, order in architecture may be traced. When the tlgor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across, to support a covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The Orders are classed thus: the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE STANDARD MONITOR 34 THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN AT? C HI TECTURE The ancient and original ordeis of archi - tecture, revered by Masons, are but three,— the Dorzc, Ionzc, and Corrntk~afl, — which were invented by the Greeks. To these the Romans have added two—the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric; and the Composite, which was more Orna - mental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally. The Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian, enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks. therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. * * * * * THE srANDARD MONITOR THE FIVE HUMAN SENSES 35 Which are HEARING, SEEING, FEELING, I~MELLING, and TASTING.

THE THREE STEPS Usually delineated upon the Master’s Car - pet, are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, namely, YOUTH, MANHOOD, and AGE. They also allude to the three degrees in Freemasonry, En - tered Apprentice, Fellow-Craft, and Master Mason. In Youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as Fellow-Crafts, we should apply that knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor, and ourselves, so that in Age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy ieflection consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. WiNE CL4SSES OF EMBLEMS OR SYMBOLS OF MASONRY Eight of which are—the Pot of Incense, the Bee-Hive, the Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s Sword, the Sword pointing to a Naked Heart, the Ancbor and Ark, the lorty-seventh Problem of Euclid, the Hour-Glass and Scythe. THE POT OF INCENSE Is an emblem of a pure heart, which is rt~ways an acceptable sacrifice to Deity; itnd as this glows with fervent heat, so tthould our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent Author of our existence for the manifold blessings tnd comforts we enjoy. THE BEE-HIVE Is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virture to all created be - ings, from the highest seraph in heaven to lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"50 THE STANDARD MONITOR THE STANDARD MONITOR 51 that, as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them without 7~ iuconven- ience to ourselves. When we take a survey of Nature, we view man in his infancy more helpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for days, months, and years, totally incapable of providing sus - tenance for himself, of guarding against the attacks of the wild beasts of the ~ or sheltering himself fiom the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the great Create of heaven and earth to bave made man in - dependent; but, as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other for protectiom and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportunities for fulfilling the di~ties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man formed for social and active lItt~, the noblest part of the work of God anti he that will so demean bimself as not to be endeavoring to add to the common mtiwk of knowledge and understanding itt~y be deemed a dram’ in the Aive of iteture, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons. THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS GUARDED BY THE TYLER’S SWORD Reminds us that we should be ever watch - fiil and guarded in our thoughts, words, iiitd actions, particularly when before the uninitiated; ever bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and (DrcumIJ!~eciion.

THE A?VCHOR AND ARK Are emblems of a well-grounded hope and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that divine ark which safely wafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary shall find rest. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID Was an invention of our ancient Friend and Brother, the great Pythagoras, who, in his travels through Asia, Africa, and Europe, was initiated into several orders of Pilcsthood, and is said to have been raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. 1lrls wise philosopher enriched his mind Mhilndantly in a geneial knowledge of liigs, more especially in Geometry, or fv1~tsonry. On this subject he drew out muly problems and theorems; and among the most distinguished he erected this, when, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed, Aureka / signifying, in the Grecian lan - gliage, I have found ii; and upon the dis - covery of which he is said to have sacrificed ii hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be gen - eral lovers of the arts and sciences. THE HOUR-GLASS Is an emblem of human life. Behold, how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close I We can - not, without astonishment, behold the little particles which are contained in this ma - chine, how they pass away almost im - perceptibly, and yet, to our surprise, in i~e short space of an hour, they are all"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"54 THE STANDARD MONITOR exhausted.

THE SCYTHE Is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life and launches us into eternity. Behold, what havoc the scythe of time makes among the human race; if, perchance, we escape the numerous evils incident to childhood and youth, and, with health and vigor, arrive at the years of man - hood, yet withal we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of time, and be gathered to the land where our fathers have gone before us. * ft ft * * I THE STANDARD MONITOR 55 7#I/ SETTING MAUL, THE SPADE, AND THE COFFIN 9* * ft 9* ft ft ft * CHARGE — THIRD DEGREE Mv BROTHER~ Your zeal for our Insti - Igitlon, the progress you have made in our titysteries, and your steady conformity to our useful regulations, have pointed you Out as a proper object for this peculiar mark of our favor.
