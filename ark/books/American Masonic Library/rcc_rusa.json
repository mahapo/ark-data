I) it roittitittiOIY, at. that p0riOd~ there were seve~rd Orders with the words ‘Rcd Cross” in their titles. ii enee, there was a great deal of confusion The Premier Coilelave in London was constituted in 1865 and ~t& preseni mifl~itC5 go back to that tune. It is now gencrallY accepted that inn NIasoilic Order ot the Red Cross of Constantine, as worked today, was established in 1865 in England by Robert WentwOrth Little, Grand Recorder for many years The first volume of the Reports of the Grand Imperial Conclave appeared in 1868. In 1865 the venerable Knight William Henry White was elected Grand Sovereign and died the foliowii’~g year. He was jollowed by Thomas Taylour, Lord Kerilis and later the Earl of Bective, whose signature appears on the early Charters in the IJ.SA. The Order spread very rapidlY~ not only in England but elsewhere. lip to the end of 1876 (sen years) one hundred thirty-sOc Conclaves had heel? chartered of which two-thirds were outside of England including forty-eight in the U.S.A.. The title of the Order in 1865 was “The Irnpenial~ lY,celesiastical and Military Order of the Knights of the Fed Cross of Rome and Constantine.” At a later date Roiiie’’ was deletOd and the wording of the title changed with various (rand Imperial Councils. ‘The original title indicates its ritual scope as a three grade Rite of “Prince, Priest and Knight’’. The medieval C)rdes~ of ICoight of the floty Sepulchre iS known to be one of Reni~n Catholic chivalry as an extremimey select body. Time M:asonie Order of the same iiaine has never beeii separrito but always an Appetidant to the R.C. of C. There is some reason to bebcve, but no proof, that the ritual was put together by Robert Wentworth Little in 1865. It is open oiily to Knights of the R.C. of C. The Order of IK.night of St. John the Evangelist has been intiniately connected with that of the Kt. of the H.S.. it is founded upon a tradition concerning Julian the Apostate and his attempt to rebuild the Temple at J ertisalem. This tradition is recounted by Philostergious (about 400 A 0.) but lie does not claim it was a true record. It is probably apocryphal. Note: TIPs above is based in part upon THE HISTORY AND ORIGIN OF THE MASONIC AND MILITARY ORDER OF THE RED CROSS OF CONSTANTINE publtshed in 1971 by the Grand Imperial Conclave of England. On February 16, 1870, the Sovereign Grand Conclave of England (with the Earl of l3ective as Grand Sovereign) authorized Ill. Sir W.J.B.

The Orator will now recite to you the Legend of the Foundation of the Order. Orator stands East of the Central Altar, facing West. Orator’ According to tradition, this Illustrious and Chival - ric Order was founded by the great Roman Emperor Constantine before the battle of Saxa Rubra in the year 312 A.D. In this battle he finally defeated the rival Emperor MaKentius. The Order was founded in mem - ory of the divine miracle which led to the conversion of Comistamutine to the Christian Faith, and as a reward of tIme valor amid comustancy of certain of his soldiers.

The cares and responsihmlities of command, and even Royal duties, womuld not eradicate such early impressions or restraimi a profound desire after Truth and Wisdom. The manner of his conversiou-i is thus related Upon an evemuing (luring the march of his army oi-i Rome, Constantine was meditating upon earthly mat - ters am-id the damigers of his expedition against the Emperor Maxentmus. Sensible of his own inability to succeed without Divine assistance, he supplicated Heaven to grant him inspiration am-id wisdom to choose the right path The G.A.O.T.U. heard his prayer; for souldemily, as mm a vision, there appeared in the heavemus a hinillar of light in tIme shape of a cross, with tIme mmuscnml,tioii”I I-I S.V.”, meaning “In Hoc Signs Vimuct’, “ SO (‘xin i aordmimary a phenomenon created the uinimm(mst astimmi mshmincmmu mi-i the n-minds of the Emperor and lmi~ ciumifiulamims The Pagans deemed it a most mans— p~m~s ainmuen ,limit Constantine, reassured by the vision, cammS(’d a hiniyal .Stamidard, styled the Labarum, to be made.

After the rebuilding of the Second Temple the Masons neglected their labors, and abandoned to the ravages of time the valuable build - ings which they had raised with such pains ; so that the skill of their workmanship, the strength of their materials ,and the beauty of their architecture were alike exposed to confusion, destruction and decay. But the Eternal Jehovah determined to manifest His glory, and to replace the fallen material structures by those of the spirit, whose duration should be evei lasting. It was then that the stone—the corner of the building— was torn from the Temple by the workmen and thrown among the ruins. It was then that the Mystic Rose was sacrificed on a cross In an instant the veil of the Temple was rent, the earth was covered with darkness, the Day-Star of Mercy was obscured, arid the Word was lost.

Noble Knight, we are informed that yoti have discovered a sacred treasure. Relate the circtimstances thereof. Harbing : I was conducted to a place said to represent the ruins of Herod’s Temple and was advised that the Em - peror Julian had begun the erection of another building on this ancient and sacred site. Much activity was in progress and I was permitted to assist the laborers who were already working on the foundations. As the dig - ging progressed, a stone was removed which disclosed the location of an underground vault. It appeared to be very deep and, after consultation, it was decided that someone should descend to explore its meaning and contents. I was selected. The workmen lowered me by means of a rope and I found water on the floor of the vault. After my eyes becairic acctistorned to the darkness, I saw extending slightly above the siir - face of the water what appeared to be a stone column. Upon the top of this column there was something wrapped in very line material, probably lincn. As rioth - ing else of value seemed to be in the vault, I took pos - session of the object, gave the signal, and was drawn up to the light. The discovery proved to be a parchment of some age. No sooner was it opened than great fear was expressed by all present. At the very beginning of the l)ai~ch1ment were written in bold characters thcse words “In the 56 beginning was the Word, and, the Word was with GOD, and, the Word was GOD.” It proved to be a irIaiiuSCril)t copy of the Lioly Gospel according to St. John I is i imddei it, togeiher with other eveuts, boi~dering oil time niiv~cidOu5, occurring about the same lime, made it very ~laiu that our l~Ordl ‘s prol)hCCy of tIme dle~olatiOn of the Temple would stirely be fulfilled. The Gospel declared that I Ic who had 5l)Olcen was GOD—the creator of all tliiiigs It proved beyond a doubt that they who were doing the buildliuig labored in vain. A divine and immutable sentence bad alreadly dlecreed its final destruc - tion. It was now believed that it was riot pleasing to GOD that the Temple be restored.
