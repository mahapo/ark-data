Ever since symmetry began, and harmony displayed her charms, our Order has had a being. During many ages, and in many different countries, it has flourished. No art, no science preceded it. In the dark peri - ods of antiquity, when literature was in a low state, and the rude manners of our forefathers withheld from them that knowledge we now so amply share, Masonry diffused its influence. Thus science unveiled, arts arose, civilization took place, and the progress of knowledge and philosophy gradually dispelled the gloom of ignorance and barbarism. Government being settled, authority was given to laws, and the assemblies of the Fraternity acquired the patronage of the great and the good, while the tenets of the profes - sion disseminated unbounded philanthropy. Abstracted from the pure pleasures which arise from friendship so wisely constituted as that which subsists among Masons, and which it is scarcely possible that any circumstance or occurrence can erase, Masonry is a science confined to no particular country, but extends over the vi 1"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR whole terrestrial globe. Wherever the arts flourish, there it flourishes too. Add to this, that by secret and inviolable signs, carefully preserved among the Fraternity, it becomes a universal language. Hence many advantages are gained; the distant Chinese, the wild Arab, and the American say - age will embrace a brother Briton, and know that, besides the common ties of humanity, there is still a stronger obli - gation to induce him to kind and friendly offices. The spir - it of the fulminating priest will be tamed, and a moral Brother, tough of a different persuasion, engage his esteem; for mutual toleration in religious opinions is one of the most distinguishing and valuable characteristics of the Craft. As all religions teach morality, if a Brother be found to act the part of a truly honest man, his private specula - tive opinions are left to God and himself. Thus, through the influence of Masonry, which is reconcilable to the best policy, all those disputes which embitter life and sour the tempers of men are avoided, while the common good, the general object, is zealously pursued. From this view of our system, its utility must be suffi - ciently obvious. The universal principles of the Art unite, in one indissoluble bond of affection, men of the most opposite tenets, of the most distant countries, and of the most contradictory opinions; so that in every nation a Mason may find a friend and in every climate a home. Such is the nature of our institution, that in the Lodge, which is confined to no particular spot, union is cemented by sincere attachment, and pleasure reciprocally communi - cated in the cheerful observance of every obliging office. Virtue, the grand object in view, luminous as the meridian sun, shines refulgent on the mind, enlivens the heart and heightens cool approbation into warm sympathy and cor - dial attention.—Preston. THE LODGE AND ITS GOVERNMENT THE LODGE AND ITS GOVERNMENT 1. The room in which a cettain number of Freemasons assemble, for business connected with the Fratetnity, is called a Lodge. The assembly, or organized body of Freemasons, is also called a Lodge, just as the word Church is expressive both of the congregation and the place in which they meet to wor - ship. A Lodge of Freemasons, to be legally constituted, must be in possession of an unreclaimed Charter granted by the Grand Lodge in whose jurisdiction it is situated; the Book of the Law, the Square and Compasses; the Book of Constitutions; a Code of By-Laws; its Officers, and a sufficient number of members to perform the ceremonies pertaining to the Order. (The number necessary is ptovided by regulation.) 2. The Constitutional Officers of a Lodge are the Worshipful Master, Senior Warden, Junior Warden, Tteasurer, Secretary, Senior Deacon, Junior Deacon, Senior and Junior Stewards, and Tyler, to which may be added a Marshal, a Chaplain and an Organist. 3. A Lodge must assemble at least once a month for work and instructionA 4. A Particular Lodge has the right to do all the wotk of Ancient Craft Masonry; to be represented at all the Communications of the Grand Lodge; to elect and install its Officers, to increase its numbers by the admission of new members, and no member can be forced upon a Lodge without its consent; to make for its government By-Laws not conflict - ing with the laws and edicts of the Grand Lodge; to exclude a member, on cause shown, temporarily or permanently; to levy tax on its members by By-Laws; to appeal to the Grand Lodge or Grand Master from the decision of its Master; to exercise penal authority over its own members, and over all unaffiliated Masons living within the limits of its jurisdiction, and to change its time and plaLe of meeting within the town or city designated in its Charter by amendment to its By-Laws. 5. A Lodge Under Dispensation is a preliminary organiza - 2 3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE LODGE AND ITS GOVERNMENT FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR tion of Freemasons, acting under authority from the Grand Mastet, and is not entitled to representation in the Grand Lodge, cannot elect or install Officers, is without authority to adopt By-Laws or a seal, but is authorized to frame proposed By-Laws, to be submitted with application for Charter. QUALIFICATiONS OF CANDIDATES The qualifications that are essential in those who apply for initiation into the mysteries of Freemasonry are of two kinds, Internal and External. It is true that the ritual of the First Degree says that “it is the internal and not the external qualifications which recom - mended a man to be made a Mason;” but the context of the sentence shows that the external qualifications there referred to are “worldly wealth and honors.” The ritual, therefore, has of course no allusion to the sort of external qualifications which are here to be discussed. The internal qualifications of a Candidate are those that lie within his own bosom, and are not known to the world. They refer to his peculiar disposition toward the institution — his motives and design in seeking an entrance into it. Hence, they are known to himself alone; and a knowledge of them can only be acquired from his own solemn declarations. The external qualifications are those that refer to his out - ward physical fitness for initiation, and are based on his moral and religious character, the frame of his body, the constitution of his mind, and his social position. A knowledge of these is to be acquired from a careful examination by a Committee appointed for that purpose. The person who desired to be made a Mason must be a man, believing in the existence of a Supreme Being, and of a future existence; at least twenty-one years of age; of good moral char - acter, temperate, industrious and capable of reading and writ - ing, and earning an honest livelihood; he must come of his I own free will and accord, uninfluenced by mercenary or other improper motives; be of sound mind and body; and not deformed or dismembered. Any doubt of physical conformation should be referred to the Grand Master. The use of an artificial substitute by candi - dates, to comply with the requirements of the ceremonies is not permitted except by special dispensation from the Grand Master for exceptionally good cause shown. ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES By the regulations of the Fraternity, a candidate for the Mysteries of Masonry cannot be initiated in any regular Lodge without having been proposed at least one month prior to bal - lot, unless a Dispensation be obtained in his favor. All peti - tions for the Degrees of Freemasonry must be made in writing at a Stated Communication of the Lodge, giving name, resi - dence, age, occupation, and refetences. The form of petition is prescribed by Regulation. OPENING AND CLOSING THE LODGE In all the regular assemblies of men who are convened for wise and useful purposes, the commencement and conclusion of business are accompanied with some form. In every country in the world the practice prevails, and is deemed essential. From the most remote periods of antiquity it may be traced, and the refined improvements of modern times have not total - ly abolished it. Ceremonies, when simply considered, it is true, are little more than visionary delusions; but their effects are sometimes important. When they impress awe and reverence on the mind, and engage the attention by external attraction to solemn rites, they are irfteresting objects. These purposes are affected by judicious ceremonies, when regularly conducted and properly arranged. On this ground, they have received 5 4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR TYLER’S OATH the sanction of the wisest men in all ages, and consequent - Ly could not escape the notice of Masons. To begin well is the most likely means to end well; and it has been properly remarked that when order and method are neglected at the beginning, they will seldom be found at the end. The ceremonies of opening and closing a Lodge with solem - nity and decorum therefore are universally admitted among Masons, and differ in each of the Degrees, but so slightly as not to affect their general character. They must, therefore, be considered in reference to the several purposes that they are designed to accomplish. To conduct these ceremonies with propriety ought to be the peculiar study of every Mason, especially those who have the honor to serve in our Communications. To persons who are dignified, every eye naturally is directed for propriety of con - duct and behavior; and from them other Brethren who are less informed naturally will expect to derive an example worthy of imitation. From a share in these ceremonies no Mason can be exempted. This is the first request of the Master and the pre - lude to all business. As soon as it has been signified that the Lodge is about to be opened every Officer should repair to his station or place, and the purpose of the Communication should become the sole object of attention. A Lodge must always be opened in the Third Degree for the transaction of any business except that of initiating or passing a candidate into the mysteries of the First or Second Degree or for examination in the catechism of those Degrees. The Master may conduct the business of the Lodge in accordance with the Suggested Order of Business, or the Master may rear - range the Suggested Order of Business as his judgement and sound discretion may dictate. The first business after opening, if it be a Stated Communication, must be the reading of the minutes of the preceding Communications, Stated or Called, for the information of the Brethren and final adoption. The Lodge must always be opened and closed with ptayer.

Remember that, at this Altar, you have promised to befriend and relieve every Brother who shall need your assistance.

PRESERVATION In order to preserve our Ceremonies from innovation, it is essentially necessary that every Officer should be thor - oughly acquainted with them, and that a firm determina - tion should exist among the Craft to admit no change. A few words here or there may not in themselves appear of much consequence, yet, by frequent repetition, we become accustomed to them, and thus open the door to evils of more serious magnitude. There is, and there can be, no safety but in a rigid adherence to the Ancient Ceremonies of the Order. darkness, helpless, ignorant and destitute. Having been wandering amid the errors and subjected to the pollutions of the outer and profane world, he comes inquiringly to our doors, seeking new birth and the withdrawal of the veil that conceals Divine Truth from his uninitiated sight.

It being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematical of the twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby are found eight hours for the service of God and a distressed worthy Brother, eight for our usual vocations, and eight for refreshment and sleep. The Common Gavel is an ir~strument made use of by operative Masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder’s use, but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and con - sciences of the vices and supeffluities of life, thereby fitting our minds as living stones for that spiritual building—that house not made with hands—eternal in the heavens. 30 31"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE Agreeable to an ancient custom, it now becomes my duty to demand of you some mineral or metallic substance, not for its intrinsic value alone, but that it may be deposit - ed among the archives of this Lodge to show that you were herein made a Mason. * * * * * * * *7 CANDIDATE 5: * * * * WORSHIPFUL MASTER : * * * * yourself (yourselves) * * * *7 CANDIDATE S (May answer.)

(or, which I will now deliver.) LECTURER : SYMBOLISM OF THE DEGREE The First, or Entered Apprentice Degree of Freemasonry is intended, symbolically, to represent the entrance of man into the world, in which he is afterwards to become a liv - ing and thinking actor. Coming from the ignorance and darkness of the outer world, his first craving is for light— not that physical light which springs from the great orb of day as its fountain, but that moral and intellectual light which emanates from the primal source of all things—from the Grand Architect of the Universe—the Creator of the sun and of all that it illuminates. Hence the great, the pri - mary object of the First Degree is to symbolize that birth of intellectual light in the mind; and the Entered Apprentice is the type of unregenerate man, groping in moral and mental darkness, and se~eking for the light which is to guide his steps and point him to the path which leads to duty and to Him who gives to duty its reward. 32 33"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE Those around you are your Brethren, ready to discharge all the offices of that intimate relation. They now bid you welcome to their number and fellowship, to their affections and assistance, to their privileges and joys; and through me they promise to protect you by their influence and authori - ty, to advise you by their abilities and skill, to assist your need by their [iberality and bounty, and to cheer you at all times with their kindness and love. Your diligence and activity, your skill in acquiring the instructions of your Degree, and your zeal in the cause of Freemasonry will lead you forward to greater heights, to clearer views, and nobler privileges. THE PREPARATION (OPTIONAL) (The preparation is in all points symbolical. The Candidate is in search of Light and Wisdom. He rep - resents the individual man as he comes from the darkness of the outer world, and he wanders in this darkness until first guided by experience, in which is involved suffering, calamity, and distress, and after - ward by Reason when Faith and Love unseal his eyes to the light of knowledge and liberty.) RECAPITULATION The Forms and Ceremonies of your initiation may have seemed to you light and frivolous, if not absolutely unmeaning, and of such a nature that they could have been waived or adopted at pleasure; but such I assure you is not the fact, as none of them could have been properly omitted; for it may with truth be said of Freemasonry that all of its Forms and Ceremonies have emblematical mean - ing and those through which you have just passed will now be explained to you. This section is framed into a lecture of 34 f two parts, the first tracing those Forms and Ceremonies, and the second explaining why you were thus dealt with. Without the explanation given in this section the mind of the initiate would still be in darkness; all would be mys - terious and incomprehensible. When these Ceremonies are properly explained, the Candidate discovers that his progress is replete with valuable instruction and the asser - tion is confirmed that every character, figure and emblem depicted in the Lodge has a moral signification, inculcates the practice of the noblest virtues and furnishes sufficient proof of the correctness of the definition that “Freemasonry is a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.” You were first prepared by Almighty God * * knocks. You were divested * * * * * * into the Lodge. Secondly, at the building * * * * * human hands. You were neither * * * * * * * a Mason. You were neither * * * * * * * “for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was a testimony in Israel.?’ This we do, * * * * we are engaged. You were * * * * * the form thereof. (Various passages of Scripture are referred to in this section as explaining the traditions of Masonry and are for reference only.) (II.

KINGs 6:7. “And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was nei - ther hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. ‘) (RUTH 4:7. ‘Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.”) (ST. MATTHEw 7:7. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”) You were caused * * * * * “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” When applied * * * * it was opened unto you.~ You were received * * * * to you.

You will have observed, my Brother(s), * Compasses, * * * * * * * * * * * * * * truly pre - * * * * The right hand has in at[ ages been deemed an emblem of fidelity, and our ancient Brethren worshipped Deity under the name Fides, or Fidelity, which was sometimes represented by two right hands joined, and sometimes by two human figures clasping tight hands. * * * * * r (OPTIONAL) (The placing of the right hand upon the Holy Scriptures is distinctly laid down as a necessary part of the formality of the oath, meaning the Holy Gospels being touched.) You were presented * * * * * * a Mason. The Lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence. He, therefote, who wears the Lambskin as the badge of a Mason is constantly reminded of that purity of life and rectitude of conduct so essentially necessary to his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. You were placed * * * * * * and to all out - ward appearance a just and upright man and Mason, (just and upright men and Masons), and he gave it you strictly in charge: “ever to walk and act as such before God and man.~~ (OPTIONAL) (In the important ceremony which refers to the north - east corner of the Lodge, the candidate becomes as one who is to all outward appearance a perfect and upright man and Mason, the representative of spiri- tual corner-stone on which he is to erect his fwure moral and Masonic edifice.) (OPTIONAL) (A corner-stone is perfectly square on its surface, it is in its form and solid, a cube. Now, the square and cube are both imp qrtant and significant symbols. The square is an emblem of Morality, or the strict perfor - mance of every duty. The square teaches us to regu - late our conduct before God and man. The cube is a 36 37"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR symbol of truth and wisdom, and moral perfection. Justice stands upon Divine truth.) In the erection of al[ great and important buildings, especially those of Masonic form, “The first or corner-stone is taid in the northeast corner.” You were therefore, thus, appropriately placed to represent a spirituat corner-stone upon which you are to erect your future, “moral and Masonic edifice.’’ You were then ordered reconducted to the place whence you came and there reinvested with that of which you had been divested and returned to the Lodge. (This Section explains the manner of constituting and the proper authority for holding a Lodge. Here, also, we learn where Lodges were anciently held, their Form, Support, Covering, Furniture, Ornaments, Lights and Jewels, How Situated, and To Whom Dedicated, as well in former times as at present.) HOLY BIBLE, SQUARE, COMPASSES AND CHARTER A Lodge is an assemblage of Masons, duly congregated, having the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, and a Charter or Warrant authorizing them to work. Lodge Communications at the present day are usually held in upper chambers—probably for the better security which such places afford. It may be, however, that the cus - tom had its origin in a practice observed by the ancient Jews of building their temples, schools and synagogues on high hills, a practice which seems to have met the appro - bation of the A[mighty, who ~aid unto the Prophet EzekieL “Upon the top of the mountain, the whole timit thereof round about shall be most holy.” - 38 ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE FORM AND DIMENSIONS OF A LODGE The form of a Lodge is an oblong * * * (Masonically meaning a square within a square). Its dimen - sions, from east to west, embracing every ctime between north and south. In fact, its universal chain of friendship encircles every portion of the human fraternity and beams wherever civilization extends. THE SUPPORTS OF A LODGE A Lodge is metaphorically supported by three great pil - lars, denominated Wisdom, Strength and Beauty; because there should be wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important undertakings. They are represented by the three principal officers of the Lodge: the pillar Wisdom, by the Worshipful Master in the East, who is presumed to have wisdom to open and govern the Lodge; the pitlar Strength, by the Senior Warden in the West, whose duty it is to assist the Worshipful Master in the discharge of his arduous [abors; and the pillar Beauty, by the Junior Warden in the South, that situation enabling him the better to observe that bright luminary which, at its meridian height, is the beauty and glory of the day. THE COVER [NO OF A LODGE The Covering of a Lodge is no less than the clouded canopy or starry-decked heaven, where all good Masons hope at last to arrive by aid of that theo[ogical ladder which Jacob in his vision saw extending from earth to heaven, the principal rounds of which are denominated Faith, Hope and Charity, which admonish us to have Faith in God, Hope in im’mortality, and Charity toward alt mankind. The greatest of these is Charity; for our Faith may be lost in sight, Hope ends in fruition, but Charity 39"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE extends beyond the grave, through the boundless realms of eternity. THE FURNITURE OF A LODGE Every wel[ reguLated and governed Lodge is furnished with the Holy Bible, Square and Compasses, together with a Charter or Dispensation. The Holy Bible is dedicated to the service of God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to Man, as the * * *, * * * * * our Brethren. (OPTIONAL) (The Holy Bible is properly called a greater Light in Mason~, for from the center of the Lodge it pours forth upon the East, the West and the South its reful - gent rays of Divine Truth. The Bible is used among Masons as the symbol of the will of God, however it may be expressed.) The Square is dedicated to the Worshipful Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem of his office, and the Compasses to the Craft, because by a due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind, especially the Brethren. THE ORNAMENTS The Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King Solomon’s Temple; the Indented Tessel, of that beautiful tessellated border or skirting which surrounded it., The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, check - ered with good and evil; the Indented Tessel, or tessellated border, of the manifold blessings and comforts which con- stantly surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. THE LIGHTS—HOW SITUATED A Lodge has three Lights, situated East, West and South, There is none in the North, because King Solomon’s Temple was situated so far north of the ecliptic that the sun, even at meridian, did not dart its rays into the northernmost part thereof. The North, therefore, we Masonically term a place of darkness. THE JEWELS A Lodge has six Jewels—three movable and three immov - able. The immovable Jewels are the Square, Level and Plumb. The Square inculcates morality; the Level, equality; and the Plumb, rectitude of conduct. These Jewels are so termed because they are appropriated to particular parts of the Lodge, where aLone they should be found—the Square to the East, the Level to the West and the Plumb to the South. Although the Brethren occupying those stations may from time to time be changed, the Jewels will always be found in their respective stations in the Lodge. The movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar and the Trestle-board. The Rough Ashlar is a stone in its rude and natural state, as taken from the quarry; the Perfect Ashlar is one prepared by the workmen, to be adjusted by the working tools of the Fellow Craft; and the Trestle-board is for the master work - man to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state 40 41"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous educa - tion, our own endeavors and the blessing of God. The opera - tive workman erects his temporal building in accordance with the designs laid down upon the Trestle-board by the master workman; so should we, both operative and specula - tive, endeavor to erect our spiritual building in accordance with the designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Great Book of Nature and Revelation, which is our spiritual, moral and Masonic Trestle-board. HOW SITUATED Lodges are situated due east and west, because King Solomon’s Temple was so situated. Moses, by divine com - mand, after having conducted the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, through the Red Sea and into the wilderness, erected a Tabernacle to God, which he situated due east and west, to commemorate that miraculous east wind which wrought their mighty deliv - erance. King Solomon’s Temple is said to have been a repre - sentation of that Tabernacle. TO WHOM DEDICATED Lodges were anciently dedicated to King Solomon, as he was our first Most Excellent Grand Master; but modern Masons dedicate theirs to Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry. Since their time, there is represented in every regu - lar and well governed Lodge, a certain point within a cir - cle—the point representing an individual Brother; the circle, the boundary-line of his conduct toward God and man; beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, prejudices or interests to betray him, on any occasion. This circle is~ between the two perpendicular para[lel lines, which repre - sent those Saints, who were perfect parallels in Christianity, as well as in Masonry; and upon the vertex rests the Holy [ Scriptures, which point out the whole duty of man. In going around this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed it is impossible that he should materially err. TENETS The principal tenets of our profession are three-fold, including the inculcation and practice of those truly com - mendable virtues, Brother[y Love, Relief and Truth. BROTHERLY LOVE By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the whole human race as one family—the high, the low, the rich, the poor—who, being created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, ought to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance. RELIEF To relieve the distressed, is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly on Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhap - py; to sympathize with them in their misfortunes; to compas - sionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in view. On this basis, we form our friendships and establish our connections. TRUTH Truth is a Divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good merk and true, is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct. Flence, while 42 43"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR ENTERED APPRENTICE DEGREE influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown among us; sincerity and plain dealing distinguish us; and the heart and the tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity.

There is nothing freer than Chalk, the slightest touch of which leaves a trace; anciently, there was nothing more fer - vent than Charcoal, for to it, when properly ignited, the most obdurate metals would yield; there is nothing more zealous than Clay, our Mother Earth, for it alone of all the elements has never proved unfriendly to man. Bodies of water deluge him with rain, oppress him with hail and drown him with inundation; the Air rushes in storms and prepares the tempest; and Fire lights up the volcano; but the Earth, ever kind and indulgent, is found subservient to his wishes. Though constantly harassed, more to furnish the luxuries than the necessities of life, she never refuses her accustomed yield, spreading his pathway with flowers and his table with plenty. Though she produces poison, still she supplies the antidote, and returns with interest every good committed to her care; and when at last he is called upon to pass through the “dark valley of the shadow of death” she once more receives him, and piously covers his remains within her bosom, thus admonishing us that from it we came, and to it we must shortly return. FOR INSTRUCTION (OPTIONAL) (Such is the arrangement of the different sections in the first lecture, which, with the forms adopted at the opening and closing of a Lodge, comprehends the whole of the First Degree of Freemasonry. This plan has the advantage of regularity to recommend it, the support of precedent and authority and the sanction and respect which flow from antiquity.) Thank you, Worshipful Master and Brethren.

To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and in doing unto him as you would he should do unto you; and to yourself, in avoiding all irregularities and intemperance, which may impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private esteem. In the state you are to be a quiet and peaceful citizen, true to your government, and just to your country. You are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor, be particularly careful to avoid censure and reproach. Although your frequent appearance at our Communications is earnestly solicited, yet it is not meant that Masonry should interfere with your necessary voca - tions; for these are on no account to be neglected; neither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it.~ At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well- informed Brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be to receive instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the Order; as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you find a person desirous of being initiated into the Fraternity, be particu - larly careful not to recommend him, unless you are con - vinced that he will conform to our rules; that the honor, glory, and reputation of the institution may be firmly estab - lished, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. CHARGE (AT THE INITIATION OF A SOLDIER) Brother, our Institution breathes a spirit of general phi - lanthropy. Its benefits, in a social point of view, are exten - sive. In the most endearing ties, it unites all mankind. In every nation, wherever civilization extends—and not unfrequently among the wild savages of the forest—it opens an asylum to a Brother in distress, and grants hospi - tality to the necessitous and unfortunate. The sublime principles of universal goodness and love to all mankind, which are essential to it,~ cannot be lost in national distinc - tions, prejudices, and animosities.

It has often performed the part of the Angel of Goodness, in ministering to the wants of the sick, the wounded, and the unfortunate prisoner of war. It has even taught the pride of victory to give way to the dictates of an honorable connection. Pure patriotism will always animate you to every call of your country to repel an invading foreign foe, or in subdu - ing the rebellious intentions of those within the limits of our own land who become faithless to the high duty of a citizen. But should you, while engaged in the service of your country, be made captive, you may find affectionate Brethren where others would find only enemies. The Institution also demands that you shall be a quiet and peaceable citizen, true to your government, and just to your country; yielding obedience to the laws which afford you protection. In whatever country you travel, when you meet a Mason, you will find a brother and a friend, who will do all in his power to serve you; and who will relieve you, should you be poor or in distress, to the utmost of his ability, and with a ready cheerfulness.

Every Ceremony has its mystical refer - ence, and every Landmark its [egitimate explanation. It is consistent in all of its parts, which point to one and the same object, kept prominently in view in all of the degrees. Every Landmark and every mystical Ceremony constitute a pLain type of some great event which appears to be inti - mately connected with our best and dearest interest. Conveying instruction by symbols has been a means made use of among all nations in all parts of the world, dat - ing back in its history to the first teachers of man. All the wise men of the East, including Solomon, the great and wise King of Israel, as well as those from the humbler walks of life, have veiled their discourse in allegory and illustrat - ed it by symbols. The First Degree in Masonry is symbolic and moral. The Second embraces history and science. The Allegory of Freemasonry is the building of King Solomon’s Temple at Jerusalem, and our legends date from that epoch. The working tools there used furnish us with many of our sym - bols, and many of our ceremonies were practiced by its builders. In order to facilitate the work of building and pre - vent confusion in the payment of wages, the Craft were divided into classes, or, as we designate them, Degrees, and to each class was assigned methods of recognition. The Second Class, or FelLow Crafts, received their wages in [ 54 55"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE Corn, Wine and Oil in the Middle Chamber. Hence we say a Lodge oF Fellow Crafts represents the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple, as does that of the Entered Apprentice the Ground Floor. We term advance - ment to this Degree “passing” and we say “passed to the Degree of Fellow Craft,” for in going from the ground floor to the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple, one necessarily passed between two beautiful brazen pillars. Freemasonry is classed under two denominations— Operative and Speculative. OPERATIVE MASONRY By Operative Masonry we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelters from the vicissitudes and inclemencies of seasons; and while it dispLays the effects of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demonstrates that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. SPECULATIVE MASONRY By Speculative Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the Square, keep a tongue of good report, main - tain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligations to pay that rational homage to the Deity which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness. It leads the contemplative to view with reverence and admiration the glorious works of cre - ation, and inspires him with the most exalted ideas of the perfection of his Divine Creator. We work in Speculative Masonry, but our ancient brethren wrought in both Operative and Speculative. They worked at the building of King Solomon’s Temple, and many other sacred and Masonic edifices. They wrought six days and rested on the seventh. This section also refers to the origin of the Jewish Sabbath, as weLl as to the manner in which it was kept by our ancient brethren. In six days God created the heaven and the earth, and rested upon the seventh; the seventh day, therefore, our ancient brethren consecrated as a day of rest from their labors, thereby enjoying frequent opportunities to contem - plate the glorious works of creation and to adore their great Creator. * At the building of King Solomon’s Temple, before * * * * * Middle Chamber.

THE USE OF THE GLOBES Their principal use, besides serving as maps to distin - guish the outward parts of the earth and the situation of the fixed stars, is to illustrate and eKplain the phenomena arising from the annual revolution and the diurnal rotation of the earth around its own axis. They are invaluable instruments for improving the mind, and giving it the most distinct idea of any problem or proposition, as well as enabling it to solve the same. Contemplating these bodies, we are inspired with a due reverence for the Deity and His works, and are induced to encourage the studies of astronomy, geography, navigation, and the arts dependent on them, by which society has been so much benefitted.

By Order in Architecture is meant a system of all the members, proportions and ornaments of columns and pilasters; or, it is a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a buiLding, which, united with those of a column, form a beautiful, perfect and complete whole. ANTIQUITY From the first formation of society order in architecture may be traced. When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelter from the inclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid 58 59"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE others across to support a covering. The bands which con - nected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of the base and capital of pillars, from which simple hint, originally, proceeded the more improved art of architecture. The five orders are thus classed:—The tuscan, doric, ionic, corinthian, and composite. THE TUSCAN The Tuscan is the most simple and solid of the five orders. It was invented in Tuscany whence it derives its name. (OPTIONAL) (its column is seven diameters high, and its capital, base and entablature have but few mouldings. The simplicity of the construction of this column renders it eligible where ornament would be superfluous.) THE DORIC The Doric, which is plain and natural, is the most ancient, and was invented by the Greeks. (OPTIONAL) (Its column is eight diameters high, and has seldom any ornament on base or capital, except mouldings— though the frieze is distinguished by rriglyphs and me ropes , and triglyphs compose the ornaments of the frieze. The solid composition of this order gives it a preference in structures where strength and a noble simplicity are chiefly required. The Doric is the best proportioned of all the orders. The several parts of which it is composed are founded on the natural posi - tion of solid bodies. In its first invention, it was more simple than in its present stare. In aftertimes, when it began to be adorned, it gained the name of Doric: for when it was constructed in its primitive and simple form, the name of Tuscan was conferred on it. Hence the Tuscan precedes the Doric in rank, on account of its resemblance to that pillar in its original state.) THE IONIC The Ionic bears a kind of mean proportion between the more solid and delicate orders. (OPTIONAL) (Its column is nine diameters high; its capital is adorned with volutes, and its cornice has dentils. There is both delicacy and ingenuity displayed in this pillar, the invention of which is attributed to the lonians, as the famous “Temple of Diana,” at Ephesus, was of this order. it is said to have been formed after the model of an agreeable young woman, of an elegant shape, dressed in her hair; as a contrast to the Doric order, which was formed after that of a strong, robust nun.) THE CORINTHIAN The Corinthian, which is the richest is deemed ~ ~ast~rpiece of art. (OPTIONAL) of the five orders, (Its column is ten diameters high, and its capital is adorned with two rows of leaves, and eight volures, which sustain the abacus. The frieze is ornamented with curious devicgs; the cornice with dent ils and modillions. This &rder is used in stately and superb structures. It was invented at Corinth by CALLI- MACHUS, who is said to have taken the hint of the 60 61"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE capital of this pillar from the following remarkable circumstance: Accidentally passing by the tomb of a young lady, he perceived a basket of toys, covered with a tile, placed over an acanthus-root, having been left there by her nurse. As the branches grew up, they encompassed the basket until, arriving at the tile, they met with an obstruction, and bent downwards. CALLIMACHUS, struck with the object, set about imitating the figure; the vase of the capital he made to represent the bas - ket; the abacus, the tile; and the volutes, the bending leaves.) THE COMPOSITE The Composite is compounded of the other orders, and was contrived by the Romans. (OPTIONAL) (Its capital has the two rows of leaves of the Corinthian, and the volutes of the Ionic. Its column has quarter-rounds, as the Tuscan and Doric orders; it is ten diameters high, and its cornice has dentils, or simple modillions. This pillar is generally found in buildings where strength, elegance and beauty are displayed.) THE INVENTION OF ORDER IN ARCHITECTURE The ancient and original orckrs of architecture revered by Masons are no more than three~ The Doric, Ionic and Corinthian, which were invented by the Greeks. To these, the Romans have added two—the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental, if not more beautiful, than the Corinthian. The first three orders alone, however, show invention and particular character, and essentially differ from each other; the two others have nothing but what is borrowed, and differ only accidentally: the Tuscan is the Doric in its earliest state; and the Composite is the Corinthian enriched with the Ionic. To the Greeks, therefore, and not to the Romans, we are indebted for what is great, judicious, and distinct in architecture. Of these five orders, the ionic, doric, and corinthian, as the most ancient, are revered by Masons for another rea - son; as * * * * beauty. THE FIVE SENSES OF HUMAN NATURE (An analysis of the human faculties is next given in this section, in which the five External Senses par - ticularly claim attention.) The Five * * * * * * * Senses of Human Nature, which are Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Tasting. HEARING Hearing is that sense by which we distinguish sounds, and are capable of enjoying all the agreeable charms of music. (OPTIONAL) (By it we are enabled to enjoy the pleasures of soci - ety, and reciprocally to communicate to each other our thoughts and intentions, our purposes and desires; and thus our reason is rendered capable of exerting its utmost power and energy. The wise and beneficent Author of Nature ihtended, by the formation of this sense, that we should be social creatures, and receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge 62 63"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR from social intercourse with each other. For these purposes we are endowed with hearing, that, by a proper exertion of our rational powers, our happiness may be complete.) (Takes the step.) SEEING Seeing is that sense by which we distinguish objects. (OPTIONAL) (And, in an instant of time, without change of place or situation, view armies in battle array, figures of the most stately structures) and all the agreeable variety displayed in the landscape of Nature. By this sense, we find our way on the pathless ocean, traverse the globe of earth, determine its figure and dimensions, and delineate any region or quarter of it. By it we measure the planetary orbs, and make new discover - ies in the sphere of the fixed stars. Nay, more, by it we perceive the tempers and dispositions, the pass ions and affections of our fellow-creatures, when they wish most to conceal them; so that, though the tongue may be taught to lie and dissemble, the countenance will display the hypocrisy to the discerning eye. In fine,the rays of Light, which administer to this sense, are the most astonishing parts of the animated creation, and render the eye a peculiar object of admi ration. Of all the faculties, Sight is the noblest. The structure of the eye, and its appurtenances evince the admirable contrivance of Nature for performing all its various external and internal motions, while the variety displayed in the eyes of different animals, suited to their several ways of life, clearly demon - strates this organ to be the master-piece of Nature’s work.) (Takes the step.) FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE FEELING Feeling is that sense by which we distinguish the differ - ent qualities of bodies. (OPTIONAL) (Such as heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, figure, solidity, motion, and extension. These three senses, Hearing, Seeing and Feeling, are deemed peculiarly essential among Masons. It is by hearing we distinguish * * * “c, by seeing we perceive * * * “c, and by feeling we receive * * * *.) (Takes the step.) SMELLING Smelling is that sense by which we distinguish odors. (OPTIONAL) (The various kinds of which convey different impres - sions to the mind. Animal and vegetable bodies, and indeed most other bodies, while exposed to the air, continually send forth effluvia of vast subtilty, as well in a state of life and growth, as in the state of fermen - tation and putrefaction. These effluvia, being drawn into the nostrils along with the air, are the means by which all bodies are distinguished. Hence, it is evi - dent, that there is a manifest appearance of design in the great Creator’s having planted the organ of smell in the inside of that canal through which the air con - tinually passes in respiration.) (Takes the step.) TASTING Tasting enables us to make a proper distinction in the choice of our food. 64 65"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASON [C MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE (OPTIONAL) (The organ of this sense guards the entrance of the alimentary canal, as that of smelling guards the entrance of the canal for respiration. From the situa - tion of both these organs, it is plain that they were intended by Nature to distinguish wholesome food from that which is nauseous. Everything that enters into the stomach must undergo the scrutiny of tast - ing; and by it we are capable of discerning the changes which the same body undergoes in the differ - ent compositions of art, cookery, chemistry, pharma - cy, etc. Smelling and Tasting are inseparably connected; and it is by the unnatural kind of life men commonly lead in society, that these senses are rendered less fit to perform their natural offices.) (Takes the step.) The proper use of these five senses enables us to form just and accurate notions of the operation of Nature; and when we reflect on the objects with which our senses are gratified, we become conscious of them, and are enabled to attend to them till they become familiar objects of thought. What, therefore, can be a more proper subject for the investigation of Masons? To sum up the whole of this transcendent measure of God’s bounty to man, we shall add that Memory, Imagination, Taste, Reasoning, Moral Perception, and all the active powets of the soul, present a vast and boundless field for philosophical discourse, which far exceeds human inquiry, and are peculiar mysteries, known only to Nature and to Nature’s God, to whom all are indebted for cre - ation, preservation, and every blessing we enjoy. 66 THE SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS AND SCIENCES (OPTIONAL) (The seven liberal arts and sciences which are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy, are here illustrated. Grammar is the science which teaches us to express our ideas in appropriate words, which we may after - ward beautify and adorn by means of Rhetoric; While Logic instructs us how to think and reason with propriety, and to make language subordinate to thought. Arithmetic, which is the science of computing by num~ers,is absolutely essential, not only to a thor - ough knowledge of all mathematical science, but also to a proper pursuit of our daily avocations. Geometry, or the application of Arithmetic to sensible quantities, is, of all sciences, the most important, since by it we are enabled to measure and survey the globe that we inhabit. Its principles extend to other spheres and, occupied in the contemplation and measurement of the sun, moon, and heavenly bodies, constitute the sci - ence of Astronomy; and lastly, when our minds are filled, and our thoughts enlarge~,by the contemplation of all the wonders which these sciences open to our view, Music comes forward, to soften our hearts and cultivate our affections by its soothing influences.) On the mind all our knowledge must depend; let us therefore considet those seven liberal arts and sciences, which so beautifully adorn the mind and to which the * * * * at which we have now arrived allude. The seven liberal arts and sciences are Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy. 67"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE GRAMMAR Grammar is the key by which alone the door can be opened to the understanding of speech. (OPTIONAL) (It is Grammar which reveals the admirable art of language, and unfolds its various constituent parts— its names, definitions, and respective offices; it unravels, as it were, the thread of which the web of speech is composed. These reflections seldom occur to anyone before his acquaintance with the art; yet it is most certain that, without a knowledge of Grammar, it is very difficult to speak with propriety, precision, and purity.) (Takes the step.) RHETORIC It is by Rhetoric that the art of speaking eloquently is acquired. (OPTIONAL) (To be an eloquent speaker in the p roper sense of the word, is far from being either a common or an easy attainment. It is the art of being persuasive and com - manding; the art, not only of pleasing the fancy, but of speaking both to the understanding and to the heart.) (Takes the step.) LOGIC Logic is that science which directs us to form clear and distinct ideas of things, and thereby prevents us from being misled by their similitude or resemblance. (OPTIONAL) (Of all the human sciences, that concerning man is certainly most worthy of the human~mind, and the proper manner of conducting its several powers in the attainment of truth and knowledge. This science ought to be cultivated as the foundation or ground work of our inquiries, particularly in the pursuit of those sublime principles which claim our attention as Masons.) (Takes the step.) ARITHMETIC Arithmetic is the art of numbering, or that part of the mathematics which considers the properties of numbers in general. (OPTIONAL) (We have but a very imperfect idea of things without quantity, and as imperfect of quantity itself, without the help of Arithmetic. All the works of the Almighty are made in numbers, weight and measure; there - fore, to understand them rightly, we ought to under - stand arithmetical calculations; and the greater advancement we made in the mathematical sciences, the more capable we shall be of considering such things as are the ordinary objects of our conceptions, and be thereby led to a more comprehensive knowl - edge of our great Creator and the work of the cre - ation.) (Takes the step.) GEOMETRY Geometry treats of the powers and properties of magni - tudes in general, where length, breadth and thickness are considered—from a point to a tine) ftom a line to a superfi - cies, and from a superfiQies to a solid. A point is the beginning of all geometrical matter. A line is a continuation of the same. 68 69"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE A superficies has length and breadth, without a given thickness. A solid has length and breadth, with a given thickness, which forms a cube, and comprehends the whole. THE ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY By Geometry, the architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his designs; the general, to arrange his soldiers; the engineer, to mark out grounds for encamp - ment; the geographer, to give us the dimensions of the world, and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, king - doms, and provinces. By it also, the astronomer is enabled to make his observations and fix the duration of times and seasons, years and cycles. In fine, Geometry is the founda - tion of architecture and the root of mathematics. (Takes the step.) MUSIC Music is that elevated science which affects the passions by sound. There are few who have not felt its charms, and acknowledged its expressions to be intelligible to the heart. It is a language of delightful sensations, far more eloquent than words; it breathes to the ear the clearest intimations; it touches and gently agitates the agreeable and sublime passions; it wraps us in melancholy, and elevates us in joy; it dissolves and inflames; it melts us in tenderness and excites us to war. This science is truly congenial to the nature of man, for, by its powerful charms the most discordant passions may be harmonized and brought into perfect unison; but it never sounds with such seraphic harmony as when employed in singing hymns of gratitude to the Great Creator of the uni - verse. (Takes the step). ASTRONOMY Astronomy is that sublime science which inspires the contemplative mind to soar aloft and read the wisdom, strength and beauty of the Great Creator in the heavens. Assisted by Astronomy, we ascertain the laws which govern the heavenly bodies and by which their motions are directed; investigate the power by which they circulate in their orbs; discover their size, determine their distance, explain their various phenomena, and correct the fallacy of the senses by the light of truth. How nobly eloquent of the Deity is the celestial hemi - sphere!—spangled with the most magnificent heralds of His infinite glory. They speak to the whole universe; for there is no speech so barbarous, but their language is understood; nor nation so distant, but their voices are heard among them. The heavens proclaim the glory of God; The firmament declareth the works of His hands. (Takes the step.) OUTER DOOR SEN]OR DEACON : Follow me, (if more than one, say:) in single file.

THE MORAL ADVANTAGES OF GEOMETRY Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences, is the basis on which the superstructure of Freemasonry is erected. By Geometry, we may curiously trace Nature through her vari - ous windings, to her most concealed recesses. By it, we dis - cover the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the pro - portions which connect this vast machine. By it, we dis - cover how the planets move in their respective orbits, and demonstrate their various revolutions. By it, we account for the return of the seasons, and the variety of scenes which 72 73"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FELLOW CRAFT DEGREE each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist; which roll through the vast expanse and are all conducted by the same unerring law of Nature. A survey of Nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imitate the divine plan and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to soci - eties, and birth to every useful art. The architect began to design; and the plans which he laid down, being improved by time and experience, have produced works which are the admiration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, has still survived. The Attentive Ear receives the sound from the Instructive Tongue, and the mysteries of Masonry are safely lodged in the repository of Faithful Breasts. Tools and implements of architecture, and symbolic emblems, most expressive, are selected by the Fraternity to imprint on the mind wise and serious truths; and thus, through a succession of ages, are transmitted unimpaired the most excellent tenets of our institution. (OPTIONAL) (Every member admitted within the walls of this mid - dle chamber, should heed the lessons here inculcated, and consider that as a Mason he is a builder, not of a material edifice but of a Temple more glorious than that of Solomon’s, a temple of Honor, Justice, Purity, Knowledge, and of Truth, and that these tools of the operative masons’ art, should indicate the labor he is to perform, the danger he is to encounter and the preparation he is to make in the uprearing of that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, wherein his soul will find rest forever, and forever more.)

The internal, and not the external, qualifications of a man are what Masonry regards. As you increase in knowledge, you will improve in social intercourse. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties, which, as a Fellow Craft, you are bound to discharge, or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. Our Laws and Regulations you are strenuously to support, and be always ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offenses of your Brethren, but, in the decision of every trespass against our rules, you are to judge with candor, admonish with friend - ship and reprehend with justice. The study of the Liberal Arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration, especially the science of Geometry, whkh is established as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry, originally syn - onymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is enriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the wonderful properties of Nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of morality. Your past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have conferred, and, in your new character, it is expected that you will conform to the prin - ciples of the Order by steadily persevering in the practice of every commendable virtue. Such is the nature of your engagements as a Fellow Craft, and to these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties. (If Brother other than the Worshipful Master reads or delivers the Charge, he will say:) Thank you, Worshipful Master and Brethren. (Then takes his seat.)

(or, which I will now deliver.) LECTURER : My Brother(s), the lecture of the Third, or Master Mason, Degree of Freemasonry is the story of * * * at the building of King Solomon’s Temple and is known as the Hiramic Legend. It was the desire of David, King of Israel, to erect an house at Jerusalem for the service of the ever-living and true God wherein all nations might worship. This high honor and distinguished privilege was denied him, howev - er, because, as we read in the sacred scriptures, David was a man of blood, and during almost the entire period of his reign was engaged in wars with surrounding nations. We learn also from the same sacred source that the God of Israel promised David that Out of his loins He would raise up a seed to serve Him, which Divine promise was later fulfilled in the person of Solomon, his son and succes - sor, who ascended the throne and reigned over Israel. It was in the second month of the fourth year of his reign, and after David had been gathered to his fathers and the last high honors paid to his memory, King Solomon commenced his preparations to erect the Temple. He called to * * * * * * a.nd money. The Temple was located on Mount Moriah, near the place where Abraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and where David met and appeased the destroying angel which was visible over the threshing floor of Oman, the Jebusite. This magnificent structure is said to have been support - ed by fourteen hundred and fifty-three columns, two thou - sand nine hundred and six pilasters, all hewn from the finest parian marble. There were employed in its building three Grand Masters, three thousand and three hundred Masters or Overseers of the work; eighty thousand Fellow Crafts, or hewers of wood and stone in the mountains and quarries, and seventy thousand Entered Apprentices or bearers of burdens. All these were classed and arranged in such manner by the wisdom of Solomon that neither envy, discord nor confusion was suffered to interrupt or disturb the peace and good fellowship that prevailed among the workmen.

(If the Lecturer desires to use the short form explana - tion of the third class of emblems, he skips all the lan - guage shown between the four asterisks * * * * and the five asterisks * * * * The Third Class of Emblems connected with this Lecture are monitorial. SHORT FORM They are: the three steps usually delineated upon the Master’s carpet, emblematical of the three principal stages of human life, YOUTH, MANHOOD, and AGE; the POT OF INCENSE, is an emblem of a pure heart; the BEEHIVE, is an emblem of industry; the BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS, GUARDED BY THE TYLER’S SWORD, reminds us to be watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words and actions; the SWORD POINTING TO A NAKED HEART, demonstrates justice; the ALLSEEING EYE, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart; the ANCHOR AND ARK, are emblems of a well- grounded HOPE and a well-spent LIFE; the FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID, is an emblem of education; the HOUR GLASS, is an emblem of human life; and the SCYTHE, is an emblem of time. LONG FORM (OPTIONAL) THE THREE STEPS The three steps usually delineated upon the Master’s car - pet are emblematical of the three principal stages of human life; Youth, Manhood and Age. In Youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as Fellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the dis - charge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor, and ourselves; so that, in Age, as Master Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflection consequent on a well-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality. THE POT OF INCENSE The Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an acceptable sacrifice to the Deity; and as this 92 93"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR MASTER MASON DEGREE glows with fervent heat, so should our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and beneficent Author of our existence, for the manifold blessings and comforts we enjoy. THE BEEHIVE The Beehive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of that virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven to the lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that, as we came into the world rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious ones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us are in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them without inconvenience to ourselves. When we take a survey of Nature, we view man in his infancy, more helpless and indigent than the brute cre - ation; he lies languishing for days, months, and years, total - ly incapable of providing sustenance for himself, or guard - ing against the attack of wild beasts of the field, or sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might have pleased the Great Creator of Heaven and Earth to have made man independent of all other beings; but as dependence is one of the strongest bonds of society; mankind were made dependent on each other for protec - tion and security, as they thereby enjoy better opportuni - ties of fulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus man was formed for social and active life—the noblest part of the work of God; and he that will so demean himself as not to be endeavoring to add to the common stock of knowledge and understanding, may be deemed a drone in the hive of Nature, a useless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons. THE BOOK OF CONSTITUTIONS GUARDED BY THE TYLER’S SWORD The Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tyler’s Sword reminds us that we should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words and actions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry—ever bearing in remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and circumspection. THE SWORD The Sword pointing to a Naked Heart demonstrates that justice will sooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words and actions may be hidden from the eyes of men, yet that ALL-SEEING EYE whom the Sun, Moon and Stars obey, and under whose watchful care even Comets perform their stupendous revo - lutions, pervades the inmost recesses of the human heart, and will reward us according to our merits. THE ANCHOR AND THE ARK The Anchor and the Ark are emblems of a well-ground - ed hope and a well-spent life. They are emblematical of that Divine Ark which safely wafts us over this tempestu - ous sea of troubles, and that Anchor which shall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease ftom troubling and the weary shall find rest. THE FORTY-SEVENTH PROBLEM OF EUCLID The Forty-Seventh Problem of Euclid was an invention of our ancient friend and Brother, the great Pythagoras, who in his travels through Asia, Aftica and Europe was ml- 94 95"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR MASTER MASON DEGREE tiated into several orders of priesthood and raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems; and, among the most distinguished, he erected this, which in the joy of his heart he called Eureka. In the Grecian lan - guage signifying, I have found it; and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences. THE HOUR GLASS The Hour-glass is an emblem of human life. Behold! how swiftly the sands run, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot without astonishment behold the little particles which are contained in this machine; how they pass away almost imperceptibly; and yet, to our surprise, in the short space of an hour they all are exhausted! Thus wastes man! Today, he puts forth the tender leaves of Hope; tomorrow, blossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day comes a frost which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his great - ness is still aspiring, he falls like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother earth. THE SCYTHE The Scythe is an emblem of Time, which cuts the brittle thread of life, and launches us into eternity. Behold! What havcic the scythe of Time makes among the human race. If by chance we should escape the numerous ills incident to childhood and youth, and with h~alth and vigor arrive to the years of manhood; yet, withal, we must soon be cut down by the all-devouring scythe of Time, and be gathered into the land where our fathers have gone before us. 96 THE LAST CLASS OF EMBLEMS The last class of Emblems are not monitorial, but are as secret as any of the ceremonies of this Degree. They are * * * * * * * * The * * * * was the * * * * death. The * * * it was that received * * * yours and mine. The * * * was the * * * yours and mine. The Sprig of * * * vale of tears. Thus we close the explanation of the emblems upon the solemn thought of death which, without revelation, would be dark and gloomy; but the evergreen sprig of acacia which bloomed at the head of the grave of the illustrious dead reminds us of that it~mortal part of man which sur - vives the grave and shall never, never, never die. * * * was a man * * * a proper tribute paid to his memory. 97"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR MASTER MASON DEGREE Then let us imitate this good man in his virtuous and amiable conduct; in his unfeigned piety to God; in his inflexible fidelity to his trust; that we may welcome the grim tyrant Death as a kind messenger sent from the Supreme Grand Master to summon us from this imperfect to that all-perfect, glorious and celestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.

They are performed as a melancholy Masonic duty, and as a token of respect and affection to the memory of a departed Brother. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 1. No Freemason can be buried with the formalities of the Fraternity, unless it be at his own request, or that of his next of kin, communicated to the Worshipful Master of the Lodge of which he died a member, foreigners or sojourners excepted; nor unless he be a Master Mason in good standing. There can be no exception to this restric - tion. 2. Fellow Crafts or Entered Apprentices are not entitled to Masonic funerals, nor can they be allowed to unite, as Masons, in the funeral procession of a Brother Mason. 3. No Lodge, or body of Masons as such, can unite in the funeral service of a person not a Mason, without per - mission of the Grand Master. 4. The Worshipful Master of the Lodge, having received notice of the death of a Brother Master Mason who is a member of his Lodge, and a request that the deceased Brother be buried with the ceremonies of the Craft, fixes the day and hour for the funeral (unless previously arranged by the relatives and ftietids of the deceased), and instructs the Secretary to notify the members. He may invite other members and other Lodges. as he considers proper, but the whole ceremony must be under the direc - tion of the Worshipful Master of the Lodge of which the deceased was a member. 5. Upon the death of a sojourner who had expressed a wish to be buried with Masonic ceremonies the provisions of Regulations 38.21 through 38.28 must be complied with. The duties prescribed in these Regulations will devolve upon the Worshipful Master of the Lodge within whose jurisdiction the death may occur; and if in a place where there be more than one Lodge, then upon the Worshipful Master of the oldest Lodge, unless otherwise mutually arranged. 6. Whenever civic societies or the military unite with Masons in the burial of a Mason, the body of the deceased must be in charge of the Lodge having jurisdiction. 7. If the deceased was a Past Grand Master, or an elec - tive or appointive Grand Lodge Officer, the Grand Secretary should be immediately notified by the Secretary or Worshipful Master of the Lodge in whose jurisdiction such member resided. If he was a Past Grand Master or an elective Grand Lodge Officer, the Grand Lodge may take jurisdiction. 8. The pall-bearers may be Masons, selected by the fam - ily. If the deceased was a member of a Royal Arch Chapter, Council, Commandery or Consistory, a portion of the pall - bearers may be taken from these bodies severally, however there is no requirement that the pall-bearers be Masons. 9. The proper clothing for a Masonic funeral is a black hat, black or dark clothes, black neck-tie, white gloves, and a plain white cloth or lambskin apron, with a band of black crepe around the left arm, above the elbow, and a sprig of evergreen on the breast (See Regulation 38.21). The Worshipful Master’s gavel, the Wardens’ columns, the 102 103"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FUNERAL SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS Deacons’ and Stewards’ rods, the Tyler’s sword and the Marshal’s baton should be trimmed with black crepe, neat - ly tied with white ribbon. The Bible may be covered with black crepe. 10. While the body is lying in state in the coffin there should be placed upon the latter a plain white apron. 11. If a Past or Present Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, or Grand Warden should join the procession of a particular Lodge, proper attention should be paid to him or them. They take a place after the Worshipful Master of the Lodge. Two Deacons, with white rods, should be appointed by the WorshipFul Master to attend such Grand Officers. 12. When the head of the procession shall have arrived at the place of interment, or where the services are to be performed, the lines should be opened, and the highest officer in rank, preceded by the Marshal and Tyler, pass through reversing the order. 13. Upon arriving at the entrance of the cemetery, the Brethren should march in open order to the tomb or grave. If the body is to be placed in a tomb, the Tyler should take his place in front of the open door, and the line be spread so as to form a circle. The coffin should be deposited in the circle and the Stewards may cope the Great Lights at the foot of the coffin, and the Deacons may cope the Worshipful Master at the head of the coffin. The pa Il-bear - ers retire from the side of the coffin after depositing it. The mourners may be located at the foot of the coffin, or on either side, and the Worshipful Master and other Officers at the head. If the coffin is to be placed in a tomb, the Masonic service should be complet~d before the undertak - er places the coffin in the tomb. If the body is to be deposited in the earth, the Brethren should form around the grave. 14. After the Clergyman shall have performed the reli - gious services of the Church, the Masonic services should begin. (See No. 21.) 15. A Lodge in procession is to be under the same disci - pline as in the lodge-room. 16. Masonic funeral services are of two kinds: “Church or residence” and “grave.” Services are held in the lodge- room, Church or residence only when they can not be con - ducted at the grave. The Masonic service at the Church or residence should not be conducted unless by special request of the family. The “grave” ceremony is always to be con - ducted at a cemetery. The ceremony in the Lodge-room is optional with the Worshipful Master. 17. In opening the Lodge, the Worshipful Master makes pro tem appointments to fill any vacancies among the Officers. When the Lodge is opened, he states the purpose of the Communication and the Brethren are instructed in their respective duties and positions in the procession and at the grave, which should be rehearsed. He selects some suitable Brother to act as Marshal and, if the procession is very large, may appoint assistants or authorize the Marshal to select them. Before leaving the lodge-room, the Worshipful Master should give any special instructions or information that he may deem desirable. When all is in order, the Brethren leave the lodge-room and go in cars to the appointed place of meeting, where they form under the direction of the Marshal. At the conclusion of the public service to be performed, they return to the lodge-room and the Lodge is closed. No one should leave the procession, either in going to or returning from the funeral, except in case of real emergency. (Also see Reg. 38.42 for other options for Called Communications to conduct funerals.) 104 105"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FUNERAL SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS 18. When an Emergent or Called Communication of a Lodge is called to conduct a Masonic Funeral, the Worshipful Master should wear his hat at all times during the Lodge opening and closing except while prayer is being offered, including the Benediction. When the funeral pro - cession arrives at the grave, the Worshipful Master should remove his hat and remain uncovered until after the Benediction. The provision for a Worshipful Master to be uncovered at a Masonic funeral service shall not apply when the deceased was a member of a religious group that wears a headpiece during a funeral service. It is not required that the Worshipful Master and Craft be uncov - ered at the funeral service of a deceased Brother who was a member of a religious faith or group that traditionally remain covered during a funeral service. 19. In conducting Masonic funerals, Worshipful Masters are authorized to use any of the funeral services in the Florida Monitor, or any arrangement of parts of such ser - vices. 20. The arrangements around a grave, as shown in the Diagram for grave-side services may be rearranged to meet prevailing conditions in the cemetery where the service is to be held. 21. The Worshipful Master may preside at a Funeral Service, or he may designate another to act as Master of Ceremonies. The minister may be requested to pronounce the Benediction instead of the Chaplain.

Brother Chaplain, lead us in prayer. CHAPLAIN : Almighty and most merciful Father, we adore Thee as the God of time and eternity. As it hath pleased Thee to take from the light of our abode, one dear to our hearts, we beseech Thee to bless and sanctify unto us this dispensa - tion oF Thy providence. Inspire our hearts with wisdom from on high, that we may glorify Thee in all our ways. May we realize that Thine All-Seeing Eye is upon us, and be influenced by the Spirit of truth and love to perfect obe - dience—that we may enjoy Thy Divine approbation here below. And when our toils on earth shall have ended, may we be raised to the enjoyment of fadeless light and immor - tal life in that kingdom where faith and hope shall end, and love and joy prevail through eternal ages. And Thine, O Righteous Father, shall be the glory forever. Amen! BRETHREN : So mote it be! WORSHIPFUL MASTER : The solemn notes that betoken the dissolution of this earthly tabernacle have again alarmed our outer door, and another spirit has been summoned to the land where our fathers have gone before us. Again we are called to assemble among the habitations of the dead, to behold the “narrow house appointed for all living.” Here, around us in that peace which the world cannot give or take away, sleep the unnumbered dead. The gentle breeze fans their verdant coYering, but they heed it not; the sunshine and the storm pass over them, and they are not disturbed; stones and lettered monuments symbolize the affection of surviving friends, yet no sound proceeds from them, save that silent but thrilling admoni - tion, “Seek ye the narrow path and the strait gate that lead unto eternal life.” We are again called upon to consider the uncertainty of human life, the immutable certainty of death, and the vanity of all human pursuits. Decrepitude and decay are written upon every living thing. The cradle and the coffin stand in juxtaposition to each other; and it is a melan - choly truth that so soon as we begin to live, that moment we also begin to die. It is passing strange that, notwith - standing the daily mementoes of mortality that cross our path— notwithstanding that funeral bells so often toll in our ears and the “mournful processions” go about our streets—we will not more seriously consider our approach - ing fate. We go on from design to design, add hope to hope, and lay out plans for the employment of many years, until we are suddenly alarmed at the approach of the Messenger of Death, at a moment when we least expect him, and which we probably conclude to be the meridian of our existence. What, then, are all the externals of human dignity—the powers of wealth, the dreams of ambition, the pride of intellect, or the charm of beauty—when Nature has paid her just debt? Fix your eyes on this last sad scene and view life stripped of its ornaments, and exposed in its natural setting and you must be persuaded of the utter emptiness of these delusions. [n tlie grave, all fallacies are detected, all ranks are leveled, all distinctions are done away. Here the scepter of the prince and the staff of the beggar are laid side by side. 112 113"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FUNERAL AT GRAVE While we drop a sympathetic tear over the grave of our deceased Brother, let us cast around his foibles, whatever they may have been, the broad mantle of Masonic charity, nor withhold from his memory the commendation that his virtues claim at our hands. Perfection on earth has never yet been attained; the wisest, as well as the best of men, have gone astray. Suffer, then, the apologies of human nature to plead fot him who can no longer plead for himself. Our present Communication and proceedings will have been in vain and useless if they fail to excite our serious reflections and strengthen our resolutions of amendment. Be then persuaded, my Brethren, by this example of the uncertainty of human life, of the unsubstantial nature of all its pursuits, and no longer postpone the all-important concern of preparing for Eternity. Let us each embrace the present moment, and while time and opportunity permit, prepare with care for that great change which we all know must come, when the pleasures of the world shall cease to delight and be as a poison to our lips, and while we may enjoy the happy reflections of a well-spent life, the exer - cise of piety and virtue will yield the only comfort and consolation. Thus shall our hopes be not frustrated, nor we be hur - ried unprepared into the presence of that all-wise and powerful Judge, to whom the secrets of all hearts are known. Let us resolve to maintain with sincerity the dig - nified character of our profession. May our Faith be evinced in a correct moral walk and deportment; may our Hope be bright as the glorious mysteries that will be revealed hereafter; and our Charity boundless as the wants of our fellow-creatures. And, having faithfully discharged the great duties which we owe to God, to our neighbor, and ourselves, when at last it shall please the Grand Master of the Universe to summon us into His eternal presence, may the Trestle-board of our whole lives pass such inspection that it may be given unto each of us to “eat of the hidden manna,” and to receive the “white stone with a new name” that will insure perpetual and unspeakable happiness at His right hand. (The Master, displaying the apron, continues:) The Lambskin, or white leather Apron, is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason. It is more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle, more honorable than the Star and Garter, when worthily worn. This emblem I now place on the coffin of our deceased Brother. By it we are reminded of the universal dominion of Death. The arm of Friendship cannot interpose to pre - vent his coming; the wealth of the world cannot purchase our release; nor will the innocence of youth or the charms of beauty propitiate his purpose. The mattock, the coffin, and the melancholy grave admonish us of our mortality, and that, sooner or later, these frail bodies must moulder in their parent dust. (The Master deposits it upon the coffin.) (The Master, holding a sprig of evergreen, continues:) The evergreen, which once marked the temporary resting place of the illustrious dead, is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. By it we are reminded that we have an immortal part within us, that shall survive the grave, and which shall never, never, never die. By it we are admon - ished that, though like our Brother whose remains lie before us, we too shall soon be clothed in the habiliments of death and deposited in the silent tomb, yet through our belief in the mercy of God, we may confidently hope that our souls will bloom in eternal spring.

In conformity to this usage, and at the request of our deceased Brother, whose memory we revere, and whose loss we now deplore, we have assembled in the character of Masons, to offer up to his memory, before the world, a part - ing tribute of our affectkn, thereby demonstrating the sin - cerity of our past esteem for him, and our steady attach - ment to the principles of the Order. 116 117"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"FLORIDA MASONIC MONITOR FUNERAL AT GRAVE The Great Creator, having been pleased out of His infi - nite mercy to remove our Brother from the cares and trou - bles of this transitory existence to a state of endless dura - tion, thus severing another link from the fraternal chain that binds us together, may we who survive him be more strongly cemented in the ties of union and friendship, that during the short space allotted us here we may wisely and usefully employ our time, and, in the reciprocal intercourse of kind and friendly acts, mutually promote the welfare and happiness of each other. To those of his immediate relatives and friends, who are most heart-stricken at the loss we have all sustained, we have but little of this world’s consolation to offer; we can only sincerely, deeply and most affectionately sympathize with them in their distressing bereavement; but we can say that He who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb looks down with infinite compassion upon the widow and father - less in the hour of their desolation; and that the Great Architect will fold the arms of His love and protection around those who put their trust in Him. Then let us improve this solemn warning, so that when the sheeted dead are stirring, when the great white throne is set, we shall receive from the Omniscient Judge the thrilling invitation, “Come, ye blessed, inherit the king - dom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (May call for a song to be rendered.)

All that is mortal of our beloved Brother lies before us; the earthly house of his immortal life has fallen. It is the inevitable adventure of us all, wkich no wealth or honor, no power or station can avert. Once more we meet upon the level—the common level of a great sorrow. Let us remember tkat while we are but human, we partake, as well, of the Divine nature, and, as children of the Heavenly Father, have been taught to trust the power that doeth all things well, in death as in life. One subject upon which Masonry sounds no uncertain note is the doctrine of the immortality of the soul.
