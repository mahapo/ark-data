II. THE iNEFFABLE DEGREES AND TI-fE RITE 1. The Ineffable Degrees, 40.140 inclusive, are linked his - torically with a system of twenty-Five so-called “higher degrees” which flourished in France in the Eighteenth Century and which came to be known as The Rite of Perfection. In 1740, the first Ecossais (Scottish) Lad ge—Parfaite Harmonie—was organized in Boideaux, the oldest and most influential Masonic center in France. There is evidence that some of these advanced degrees had an ancestral source in England and Scotland. In or about 4 w 2 •1 (I ) 3 Grand Elect Mason .3 1763, these degrees were brought to the West Indies by Stephen Morin of Bordeaux, under a Patent granted by the Masonic au - thorities in Pans. Before the end of the Eighteenth Century, othci (legrees were added until the Bite had a ritual structure of thirty- three degrees. 2. Henry Andrew Francken (1720-1795) deputized by Stephen Morin, organized a Lodge of Perfection in Albany, New York, in 1767. This was the beginning of what was to become the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite in the United States Within a few years, similar groups were formed in Philadelphia; Charleston, South Carolina; Baltimore; Savannah; Brooklyn and Troy, New York, and New York City. All of these groups were independent, with little ofEcial connedions or centralized supervision or control, except to agree that their authonty came from Jamaica and Stephen Morin. 3. On May 31, 1801, a SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE THIRTY - iHIRD DEGREE FOR TIlE UNITED STATES OF AMERiCA was founded in Charleston, South Carolina, in an effort to bring order out of Masonic chaos. Hence the motto: Ordo ab Chao. A few years later (circa 1807) the name was changed to THE Supi~is~ Cot.mcit, 33, ANCIENT AND ACCEPTED ScOTrrIsH RI-rE. The Supreme Coun - cil of 1801 has had a continuous existence as the Supreme Council for the Southern Juiisdiction. In 1813, the Supreme Council for the Northern Masonic Juri~,dict,on was organized in New York City. By mutual agreement the terntorial jurisdiction of each Supreme Council “‘as adjusted in 1827. 4. These Supreme Councils made slow progress in unifying the scattered degree-confemng groups and in standardizing rituals. They were handicapped by pride in the local organization and leadership jealousies; by the Anti-Masonic agitation (1827-1840); by the Civil War and by periods of financial depression. Until about 1845, rituals were fragmentary—with little more than a title, a few words and signs, an obligation and a lecture in question-and-answer form. It was not until the Union of 1867 that the process of unifying independent groups and competing Supreme Councils was completed in the Northern Masonic Juris - diction. w"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"r 6 Fourteenth Degree III.

Lichliter, 330 ChaIrman of the Committee on Rttual.s and Ritualistic Matter from 1944 to 1957. Francken Ritual: 1783 This is the longest and most detailed ritual in the Franeken “Rite of Perfection” of 25 Degrees. In all essentials, including the esoteric section, this is the source of all later rituals. More of this Francken degree is perpetuated in subsequent revisions than in any other degree. The 140 was called “Perfection—the Ultimate Degree of Symbolic Masonry.” It was conferred in a Lodge of Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masters. The format of the Degree included a review of all of the signs, words, and lessons of the Ineffable Degrees; an Inquiry consisting of four questions; an Obligation; a ceremonial of ii Anointing, the presentation of a Ring; a Covenant of Fellowship; an Investiture; and the revelation of the Sacred Word. Subsequent revisions of the Ritual of the 140 (listed below) retained most of the essentials of the Francken Ritual with comparatively few changes.

We charge each of you to listen at - tentively, and to decide ~for yourself whether you will endeavor to conform your life to the ideals and principles of this degree. We ask neither public confession nor affirmation. We do not seek to know what answers you may make in the privacy of your own soul. Without evasion or mental reservation you will now answer these questions—not to me, not to these your Brethren—but silently, at the bar of your own conscience, and in the presence of Al - mighty God. An impressive pause Since you were made a Mason have you endeavored, at all times, to be charitable to your Brethren, in thought and in deed; and have you always tried to deal honestly and fairly with all men? Pause Have you been loyal and faithful in your obligations to your family, and have you set an example of honor and integrity in your own home? Pause Are you guilty of any fraud or deceit for which you have failed to make adequate reparation; or have you done wrong to any person without seeking to make am ends? Pause Grand Elect Mason 37 Will you seriously endeavor so to speak and act that no discredit may fall upon Freemasonry? Pause Will you earnestly seek to realize your duty to God, to worship Him according to the dictates of your con - science, and to advance His kingdom among men?

Pause (Speaking slowly and solemnly) Your answers to our questions are between you and your God. What your answers were, and what resolutions you may have made, we do not know, but we trust and we believe that, never, never in all your lives, will you forget this solemn mo - ment. Freemasonry cannot enforce its ideals. We cannot compel our Brethren to live in harmony with the lofty principles taught in our degrees. All that we can do is to entreat you to obey what cannot be enforced, and to be loyal to that which you know to be right. My Brethren, the honor of Freemasonry is in your keeping!

The cio~vn upon the JEwEL is a symbol of the royal origin of the degree. The extended compasses denote the broad knowledge of The Grand Elect.

Its form is supposed to be the true form used by the Perfect Masters at the build - ing of the Temple, and alludes to the golden triangle or delta of Enoch, which adorns the center. Junior Warden—The SASH represents the ancient Girdle of a Grand Elect Mason. It was used of old to bind up and strengthen the body, and enable man to persist in his labors. It is, therefore, an emblem of ac - tivity, promptness and perseverance. The nine colors in the SASH are arranged according to the mystic numbers of this degree, 3, 5, 7 and 9, and are thus explained: The blue is an emblem of friendship; the red, of zeal, the yellow, of wisdom. The green is a beautiful emblem of hope, and of that immortal part of man which never, never dies, the purple of dignity and majesty; the whitc of purity and innocence; the block of seriousness and modesty of demeanor. The next color is that of stone, which denotes firmness and durability and is an emblem of constancy, fidelity and decision of character—qualities which should be possessed by those who attempt to walk in the footsteps of our Grand Master, Hiram Abif. The flame color is emblematical of ardent affection and char - ity, the peculiar traits of a Grand Elect Mason. The various colors united in this one SASH are expres - sive of that unity, and the olive interwoven, of that peace 4 Grand Elect Mason 41 which should link us together as Brethren.

You have now reached that goal, for by PERFECTION we mean the completion of a symbolic journey toward a more perfect knowledge of the One, Living and True God and of His will for men. In your progress through the Ineffable Degrees, you learned that the Sacred Word of each degree was a substitute name for God, revealing one of His attributes. But one Name stands above all—ineffable and re - splendent—and in the Thirteenth Degree, as a Master of the Ninth Arch, it was your high privilege to discover the symbol of that true Name—four Hebrew letters, en - graved on a triangular plate of gold, set in a cube of agate. Here the Tetragrammaton Is displayed. This Tetragrammaton, or four-letter name, is one of the most widely recognized and deeply revered symbols known to man. These four Hebrew consonants, Y.H.V.H., cannot be pronounced as a word but, in this mystic form, the Ineffable Name was revealed to Moses at the Burning Bush.

Thrice Potent Master—( To CandidWes) —You are now ready, my Brothers, for the full unveiling of our Mysteries. In all the Ineffable Degrees we have steadily climbed onward and upward toward broader horizons, loftier planes of thought, nobler conceptions of Deity. We have been inspired by that creative Mind that made man, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life— of life immortal and eternal, a spirit—a soul—a living spark from that great, infinite, central splendor that men call—God. As a Secret Master, you were taught that, as respect - ing God, His Name is i-Iimself and Himself is His Name. To a Grand Elect Mason, the Name of God is the char - acter of God, His very nature and personality as He re - vealed Himself to Moses on Sinai—merciful and gracious, abundant in goodness and in truth. You will soon be permitted to pronounce this Name which the ancient Hebrews were unable to utter, and we charge you—as Grand Elect Masons—never to use the Holy Name of God carelessly, irreverently, or pro- Grand Elect Mason 49 fanely. We bow in adoration before the majesty and glory of God, thus seflecting, as in a mirror, that which ~ve ourselves should be—men created in His image and likeness.
