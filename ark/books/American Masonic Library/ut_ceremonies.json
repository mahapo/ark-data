They are performed as a solemn duty and as a token of respect and fraternal affection to the memory of a departed brother. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS No brother shall be buried with Masonic honors unless he was at the time of his death a Master Mason in good standing. The Worshipful Master may decline to give Masonic burial to a deceased member or sojourner whose conduct in life reflected discredit upon the Fraternity. An Entered Apprentice or a Fellow Craft shall not be allowed in the procession as a Mason at a Masonic Funeral. The Master of a Lodge, upon being notified of the death of a Brother who had expressed a wish for a Masonic funeral service, or whose family indicates such a desire on their part, shall make all suitable arrangements and in due time shall convene his Lodge and conduct the funeral, except: Upon the death of a sojourning Brother, who had expressed a wish to be buried with Masonic ceremonies, or whose family expresses such a wish, the duty of arranging for the funeral devolves upon the Master of the Lodge within whose jurisdiction the death has occurred. If more than one Lodge in the place, then the duty will be performed by the several lodges in turn, unless other arrangements are made. Other organizations may attend, in a body, the funeral services of a Mason and should be accorded every courtesy. The body of the deceased, however, must be in the charge of the Lodge having jurisdiction, and the services conducted in all respects as if none but Masons were present. A Lodge 1"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"may conduct either the public or interment portion of the funeral service, or both, as requested. After the Masonic services have commenced there can be no intermingling of any other ceremonies with the Masonic services. It is permissible, though, to allow suitable eulogies to be delivered, at the appropriate time therefor as specified in this ritual, by one or more speakers, if the family requests it, keeping in mind that Masonic tradition emphasizes brevity in the non-ritualistic portions of the ceremony. Such speakers may or may not be Masons and no regard need be paid to their religious or fraternal affiliations, but no sectarian or doctrinal discourses shall be permitted. It is likewise permissible, after the Masonic service is concluded, to allow a dedication of the grave or other ceremonial by another organization, in which case the Master, instead of dismissing those present, will announce the conclusion of the Masonic service stating that the other ceremonies will follow, whereupon the Lodge will break formation and make way for such other services but should remain at the grave until such ceremonies are concluded. It is not permissible for a Masonic Lodge to appear as such at a funeral entirely conducted by another organization, or to act simply as an escort at such a funeral; but where the services at the cemetery are to be conducted by the Lodge, it may escort the body to and from the place where the public services are to be held. MILITARY PARTICIPATION In connection with a Masonic service, this is usually confined to covering the casket with a flag, firing of a salute, 2"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"sounding taps, and folding of the flag and presenting it to a family member. The flag is usually placed on the casket when the casket is closed for the last time just before the public service commences. Everything else should be removed except the Masonic apron which may be left under the flag at the head of the casket and remain there until it is removed and handed to the Master at the grave, at which time the flag may be folded back sufficiently to remove the apron and allow the Master to replace the apron at the proper time. The Master will then again cover the apron with the flag. When the memorial roll is deposited it should be placed under the flag. The firing of the salute and the sounding of taps should follow the benediction and response at the end of the Masonic service at the grave. If the deceased was a Grand Officer or a Past Elective Grand Officer, the present Grand Officers should be invited to attend the funeral. In case of the presence of the Grand Master, the Deputy Grand Master, or a Grand Warden, the Master of the Lodge having jurisdiction should invite the Grand Officer present who has attained the highest rank to conduct the services. The proper dress to be worn at a Masonic funeral is black or dark clothing, a white shirt and a dark tie, a black or dark hat, and a plain white apron, which must be worn on the outside of the coat or overcoat. Officers conducting a funeral shall wear their official jewels. The pallbearers (usually six in number) should be appointed 3"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"by the Master except when the Lodge is to conduct only the interment service. The Master should, however, consult members of the family before appointing the pallbearers and should appoint those preferred by them. Honorary pallbearers may be permitted, if specially requested, and may or may not be Masons. Honorary pallbearers should be seated before the Lodge enters in places prepared for them where the public services are to be held, unless all of the honorary pallbearers are Masons, in which case they may march in and march out immediately after the active pallbearers. The Book of Holy Writings should be opened. The three Great Lights should be trimmed with black crepe, neatly tied with a narrow white ribbon, and placed on a board or cushion covered with black material, properly arranged for carrying. The Great Lights should be borne in a funeral procession by a member of the craft appointed by the Master. A white apron may be placed on the casket during the public service. In the absence of remains the public service in the Lodge Room, House, or Church may be used for a Memorial Service. OPENING PROCEDURES When opening a Lodge of Master Masons for funeral services, one of two methods will be selected: (1) A Lodge may open and close for each funeral service conducted, using the regular ritual for such opening and 4"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"closing. (2) A \"Lodge of Sorrow\" may be opened (using the regular ritual for such opening and closing) and remain open throughout the entire year. OPENING FOR INDIVIDUAL SERVICES One of the essentials in a Masonic funeral is that the service shall be conducted by a Lodge which has been duly opened, however, in case a Lodge is to conduct a funeral service in another city, or at a point remote from the Lodge Room, and it is not feasible or convenient for all the brethren to meet in the Lodge Room, the Master or either of the Wardens, or a Past Master, with two other brethren may open the Lodge, at the regular meeting place, repair to the place where services are to be held, and conduct services, after which the same officers who opened the Lodge, or others qualified to act in their places shall return to the Lodge Room and close the Lodge in full form. OPENING A LODGE OF SORROW A Lodge may open a \"Lodge of Sorrow\" as soon as practical or necessary after the annual installation; and immediately after opening, the \"Service in the Lodge Room\" will be performed. A \"Lodge of Sorrow\" is symbolically at labor when functioning, and is at refreshment when dismissed by the Marshal at the conclusion of the services. If a \"Lodge of Sorrow\" is opened, it will not be required to have a Tyler's 5"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"register present at the services, but the Secretary shall record the minutes of each Masonic Funeral Service and read them at the first regular meeting thereafter. The \"Lodge of Sorrow\" will be closed (if one has been opened) upon the closure of the Annual meeting in December. If a \"Lodge of Sorrow\" was opened, a Tribute will be given, at the Annual meeting, to all Brothers of that particular Lodge who have passed away during the previous Masonic year, and for all Brothers for whom a courtesy service was performed by that Lodge. As a part of the Tribute, the Memorial Roll of those departed Brothers will be read. MEMORIAL ROLL The Secretary should prepare two copies of the Memorial Roll, one to be attached to the minutes of the meeting and the other one to be placed upon the casket. IT SHOULD CONTAIN THE NAME, AGE, AND RESIDENCE OF THE DECEASED, THE NAME OF THE LODGE OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER, AND HIS MASONIC RECORD. The Master should sign the same and it should be attested by the Secretary under the seal of the Lodge. The Memorial Roll shall be read at the public service or at the grave. The Brethren should uncover when the casket is being carried through the lines and while at prayer. In the case of inclement weather, however, the Master should direct the men present not to uncover, since it is most important not to let any of the Brethren or friends suffer as the result of any unnecessary exposure to the weather. If it is ascertained that the remains of a Brother are to be sent 6"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"to some other place for interment, the Master may, out of respect to the memory of the deceased, open the Lodge and escort the remains to the railway depot, or other convenient place, and render the family or friends such assistance and courtesies as may be deemed necessary. SUGGESTIONS TO THE MASTER Get in touch with the family immediately, if possible by a personal visit, and ask how the Lodge may be of service. If a Masonic funeral is desired (and it is proper to inquire if such is the wish, but never to urge or ask that the Lodge be permitted to conduct the service) the following information may be helpful. A. If music is desired, there are two places provided for it in the ritual. B. The speaker should be informed when they are to speak, and that there is no other place in the service where a eulogy or a personal word may be spoken, and suggestion offered that the remarks be limited to approximately ten minutes. C. Direct the members to leave the ritual cards in the lodge room and not to take them to the hall or to the grave. D. Have at least two Brethren, clothed with aprons, in the corridors to direct those attending to the proper hall, and the others to act as ushers when necessary. E. Assign someone to see that the seats are properly placed in the room where the public service is to be held. F. Even though the ritual be memorized, the open book 7"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"should be held in the hand and in sight, that the public will know it is a prescribed ritualistic service. For the sake of proficiency and impressiveness, the officers should study and read their parts aloud before conducting a funeral service. The Master should commit to memory as directed in the \"SERVICE AT THE CEMETERY OR TOMB\", and also the committal paragraph which begins \"Forasmuch, etc.\" G. The Brethren should be seated during the public service, whenever possible. The Master should stand during the ritualistic service, but may take his seat during the reading of the memorial roll, the eulogy, and music. H. When the brethren are required to stand they should not be placed between the audience and the speakers. I. The Master shall not wear a hat during any of the public portions of a funeral service, except when inclement weather makes it advisable for all to remain covered at the grave. Under no circumstances should the Master wear his silk hat outside of the Lodge room. SUGGESTIONS TO THE MARSHAL The Marshal should: A. Form the procession in proper order. B. Be familiar with arrangements for all public portions of the services so he will know how to direct to the best advantage, the movements of the Lodge outside the Lodge room and the placing of the Brethren while the services are in progress. C. Make certain, also that the Mortician is advised as to the 8"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"movements the Masonic service requires so that he can handle his arrangements accordingly. SERVICE IN THE LODGE ROOM The burial of a deceased Mason is Masonic Work; and during the entire service the Lodge is at labor. (see Section 3-17-3 of the Code of the Grand Lodge, F. & A.M. of Utah.) The Master will open the Lodge on the Master Mason Degree, (See special prayer on page 2 of Monitor), state the object of the meeting, (see official cipher as to wording), appoint a Marshal, Bible Bearer, and pallbearers, and will also instruct the Lodge in the Committal Honors given at the close of the ceremonies at the grave, and will give such other instructions as may be deemed necessary. The Master calls up the Lodge and proceeds as follows: MASTER. - Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay. In the midst of life we are in death. Of whom, then, may we seek for succor, but of Thee, O Lord? My Brethren, where is the man that liveth that shall not see death? RESPONSE BY THE BRETHREN. - Man walketh in a vain shadow; he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them. MASTER. - When our brother died, did he carry nothing away with him? 9"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"RESPONSE BY THE BRETHREN. - He fulfilled his destiny. Naked he came into the world, and naked he has departed out of it. MASTER. - Hear, then the conclusion of the whole matter: It is the Lord only that can give, and it is the Lord that hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let us endeavor to live the life of righteousness, that our last end may be like his. RESPONSE BY THE BRETHREN. - God is our God, for ever and ever. He will be our guide and support, even through the dark valley of the shadow of death. MASTER. - I heard a voice from Heaven, saying unto me: \"Write from henceforth, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord! Even so, saith* the Spirit, for they rest from their labors.\" Almighty Father, in Thy hands we leave, with humble submission, the soul of our Brother. Brethren, let us pray. The Master or the Chaplain then offers the following or some other suitable prayer: \"Most glorious and merciful Lord God, our Heavenly Father! Author of all good, and Giver of all mercy! Pour down Thy blessing upon us and strengthen our solemn engagements with the ties of affection. May this solemn occasion draw our attention toward Thee, the only refuge in time of need, that, when we are about to quit this transitory scene, the enlivening prospect of Thy mercy may dispel the gloom of death; that after our departure hence in peace, we may be received into 10"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Thine everlasting kingdom, and there enjoy, in union with our departed friends, the just reward of a well spent and virtuous life. Amen.√Æ * Pronounced ‚Äúseth‚Äù. BRETHREN. - So mote it be. ORDER OF PROCESSION The Marshal shall form the procession to enter the Funeral Hall as follows: 1. The Tyler with drawn sword. 2. The Three Great Lights carried by a Brother. 3. Deacons, carrying rods. (Rods used only in Temple) 4. The Master (and Grand Master if present), escorted by the Marshal. 5. The Senior and Junior Wardens. 6. The Secretary and the Treasurer. 7. The Chaplain. 8. The Clergyman or speaker if a Master Mason. 9. The Pallbearers (if Master Masons) 10. The Stewards. (The officers named above to maintain distance of 6 to 10 11"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"feet apart.) 11. Present and Past Grand Lodge Officers. 12. Master Masons properly clothed. If the deceased was a member of other Bodies affiliated with Masonry and the members of these Bodies should unite in the procession, clothed as such, all such Bodies should follow the Lodge. The Marshal has no fixed station, but is free to move about as his duties require. Upon arrival at the Public Service he shall be seated behind the J.D. A Masonic procession should be governed by the discipline of a Lodge Room. Therefore, the utmost decorum should be observed until the Lodge is closed. The Officers present shall take positions during the public service as follows: (Masonic East) S.D. TREAS. CHAP. S.W. W.M. *G.M. J.W. SECY.

The speaker shall be seated in the Southeast. The Grand Officers and Brethren should be seated in places provided for them. If, however, it is necessary for them to remain standing they should be placed behind the Officers conducting the services; and care should always be taken in placing the Brethren to leave at least two sides of the room open for the audience and for the family. Upon the conclusion of the public services, the Marshal will escort the Master to the outside of the building where the services are held, the other Officers and the Brethren led by the Deacons following in the same order as that in which they entered; and, upon arriving outside the building, the lines will form on either side, facing inward, and the Brethren will remain at attention and uncovered, except during inclement weather, while the casket is borne to the hearse and the family has also passed through the lines. As soon as the casket has been placed in the hearse and the family seated in their cars, the Lodge should break ranks and the Brethren enter their cars, taking places in the funeral procession in advance of the hearse, if possible, so as to permit the Lodge to reach the cemetery in advance of the hearse and mourners. Upon arriving at the place of interment, the Lodge should form lines, facing inward, between the hearse and the grave and should stand at attention and uncovered while the casket is carried through the lines to the grave. The Officers will assume the same positions in one or more lines, except that the Tyler, Bearer of Great Lights, and the Stewards will be at 13"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"the foot of the grave (West). The Marshal will escort the Master and the other Officers at the head of the casket. The other Officers will, so far as possible, take the same positions as at the public services. The pallbearers will group themselves at the foot of the grave immediately behind the Bible Bearer and Tyler. The Brethren will take places back of the pallbearers, or the officers, leaving both sides of the grave open for the family and friends. These arrangements will, of course, have to be varied as conditions may require, but care should always be taken to leave sufficient space for the family and friends. After the conclusion of the services at the grave, the Lodge will break ranks, repair to their cars, and return to the Lodge Room without further ceremony. Upon arrival at the Lodge Room, the Lodge shall be closed in full form.

As a citizen, he should be loyal to his government, obedient to its laws, prompt in the duties he owes to society, and a pattern of fidelity in all social and domestic relations. As a Mason, he should cling to the old landmarks, and be sternly opposed to their infringement; be desirous to learn and apt to teach; be prompt to aid and relieve; and be ever mindful that though elevated for a time above his fellows, he is elevated by them, and should therefore cultivate everywhere and at all times the golden tenets of BROTHERLY LOVE, RELIEF, AND TRUTH.

By immemorial usage, and the established landmarks of Freemasonry, you are installed Worshipful Master of this Lodge, with powers and prerogatives which are of high importance and due solemnity. The resolutions, which, I doubt not, you have formed in your own mind, that these powers shall not be abused or perverted by you, I would gladly strengthen by word of admonition. The very consciousness of the possession of a great power will ever make a generous mind cautious and gentle in its exercise. To rule has been the lot of many, and requires neither strength of intellect nor soundness of judgment; to rule WELL has been the fortune of but few, and should be the object of an honorable ambition. It is not by the strong arm or the iron will that obedience and order - the chief requisites of good government - are secured, but by holding the key to the hearts of men.

As a citizen, he should be loyal to his government, obedient to its laws, prompt in the duties he owes to society, and a pattern of fidelity in all social and domestic relations. As a Mason, he should cling to the old landmarks, and be sternly opposed to their infringement; be desirous to learn and apt to teach; be prompt to aid and relieve; and be ever mindful that though elevated for a time above his fellows, he is elevated by them, and should therefore cultivate everywhere and at all times the golden tenets of BROTHERLY LOVE, RELIEF, AND TRUTH. As an Officer, he should remember, first of all, that he is an individual Mason, sharing in that respect a common lot with his Brethren, and therefore interested in the welfare of each and all; be devoid of undue ostentation and haughty overbearing; be accessible to all, cultivating the closest friendship and the most unlimited confidence with his associate officers; be eager to take counsel with his Brethren,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"and ready to give it; be ready to reward good; be devoid of favoritism, and wholly impartial.

Throughout the pages of that revered volume which is the Great Light of Masonry, length of life is held up as a reward to the righteous. The Psalmist sings: \"The days of our years are three score years and ten.\" This has come to be regarded as the standard of the usual allotment of time of our earthly existence. If, \"by reason of strength they be four score years,\" we consider that these additional years are the heritage of those that fear the name of the Lord."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"To be eligible to receive the \"Fifty Year\" badge of service in Masonry, the recipient must have passed the traditional boundary line, and have entered upon the years which are the heritage of the faithful. There are three steps which are symbolic of the three principal stages of human life, namely: Youth, Manhood, and Old Age. In Youth we may industriously occupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood we apply that knowledge to the discharge of our respective duties to God, our neighbor and ourselves; but it is only in Old Age, that we may enjoy the happy reflections consequent upon a life well spent. Brother , the records show that you have been a Master Mason in good standing for a period of fifty years. For half a century, you have given of yourself, of your substance, and of your devotion to Masonry. You can look back upon a lifetime of service in the Fraternity; you have assisted the widow and the orphan; you have promulgated the virtues of the brotherhood; you have protected its good name. Your fidelity entitles you to the admiration and to the esteem of your Brethren, in your own Lodge and in the Grand Jurisdiction of Utah. This emblem of service is the evidence of that appreciation which we now express to you. It sets you apart as an example of fidelity, that \"holiest of all good things which abide in a human breast.\" But your period of service is not yet ended. May you"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"continue, for many more years, to enjoy the companionship of your Brethren, and to inspire them to the faithful performance of the duties to which their Masonic vows commit them.
