Adoniram, death terminates the labor of man. Thenceforth the genera - ttons may build and occupy, but he will not be there. The teeming brain, the skillful hand, and the sinewy arm are alike useless and superfluous in the grave. As our Most Excellent King Solomon has said, “The dead know not anything; their love, their hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun,” What an incen - tive is this to a faithful use of our time and our faculties, that we should build industri - ously while our strength endures, and labor to complete our work ere the week closes and the Sabbath of Eternity sets in.

King Solomon, the Temple is now completed; in all things I have endeavor - ed faithfully to serve you, and I have now come to claim my promised reward. K. S.—Companion Adoniram, it grieves me to inform you that I cannot now comply with my promise, nor surtably reward your long and Page 28 faithfu[ service by communicating to you the M. W. The word can only be given in the presence of three. Since my promise was made a great calamiry has befallen the Craft. Grand Master H. A., as you are aware, has fallen, a martyr to his trust, the vicrim of a foul assasstnatron. Neither the M. W. nor a key to it was found on or about the body, and by his death I fear the NI. W. is forever lost. You must remain content wtrh a substitute. C. C.—IlI. King Solomon, your words re - call: to my mind a conversation I had with G. M. H. A. just prior to his death. On a certain day near high twelve I carried up a piece of work for his inspecrion. When the Craft was called from labor to refreshment I did not re - tire with the rest but lingered behind that I msght speak to our Grand Master after he should have concluded his devotions and drawn his designs upon the trestle board. When G. M. H. A. was passing out by way of the South Gate I accosted him and asked when I might expect to receive the M. W. He replied that it was uncertain that I would ever receive it, as the M. W. could only be communicated when the Temple should be completed and then only in the presence of your Majesty, your illustrious Companion of Page 29"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Tyre and himself. Whereupon I said, “Sup - pose that one of you three, even you your - self, should be removed by death prior to that event, how shall I then receive it?” He did not immediately reply, but remained for a few moments in deep meditation, and then taking me by the arm, we walked slowly around the Temple courts three times. As we walked he discoursed in the most solemn manner on the subject of death, but assured me that even though he should be taken hence the M. W. would not be lost, and each time as we came opposite the East Gate he struck the ground and, pointing downward, said, “If I die, it will be buried there.” The Craft was soon after called to labor, and I returned to my work; nor did I ever a- gain have an opportunity to converse with him upon this subject. K. S.—Your story is fraught with deep meaning, Comp. Adoniram, and the informa - tion you have furnished is of the highest im - port. My worthy Comp. of Tyre, how may we suitably reward Adoniram for the discreet si - lence he has observed regarding the disclo - sures just made as well as ft5r his long and faithful service? * H. K. T.—Ill. K. Solomon, the faithful ser - vice of Adoniram, as well as the commend - able discretion he has exhibited, should not go unrewarded, and as we cannot communi - cate to him the M. W., I propose that he be elevated to the rank of Inspector of Works, in place of him whose death we now mourn; and, as such position will place him in close com - panionship with ourselves, I further propose that he be honored with the title of R.

A., but before you can assume your new rank, or exercise the prerogatives of a R.

HISTORICAL LECTURE (K. S. directs Candidate to rise and approach the Eost. Resumes his station and gives the following his- tory:) K. S. —After the S. S. was completed and a portion of the furniture deposited therein, Adoniram on a certain day near high twelve, went’there to deposit one of the holy vessels. At high twelve, when the craft were called from labor to refreshment, Adoni-ram did not retire with the rest but lingered behind with H. A., whose custom it was at that hour to re- tire to the S. S. for his noon-day devotions, after which he drew designs for new work up - on the trestle board. Adoniram, knowing what his habits were, awaited him at the South Gate and asked when he might hope to re - ceive the M. W. The conversation which en - sued between the two craftsmen, and the soliloquy on death by our Grand Master be - came the foundation upon which was erected this degree of Royal Master. This conversation having been related to King Solomon by Adoniram, the M. W. was de - Page 35"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"posited in the S. V., as will be more fully ex - plained to you in the succeeding degree, to which this is preparatory. After the untimely death of G.M. H. A., the two surviving Grand Masters instituted this degree of R. M. in token of their respect for his memory, and as a partial substitute for the M. M. degree. Being unable to form the Triangle in giving the M. W., as one of their number was dead, they substituted the Broken Triangle, being the nearest they could come to the original. They first conferred the degree upon the noble Adoniram, and then upon other particu - lar friends of H. A. As his friend, we now confer it upon you, and we give it as illustra - tive of the M. M. and R. A. degrees. The furniture of the S. S., in the completed and dedicated Temple, consisted of many holy vessels made of pure gold, but the most im - portant article there was the Ark of the Cove - nant, called the Glory of Israel, which was seated in the midst of the holy place under the wings of the Cherubim. It was a small chest, or coffer, three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide and deep. It was made of wood, excepting only the mercy seat, but overlaid with gold, both inside and out. It had a ledge of gold surrounding it at the top, into which the cover, called the mercy seat, was let in. The mercy seat was of solid gold, the thickness of a hand’s breadth, At the two ends of it were two cherubs, looking inward toward each other, with their wings extended; which, embracing the whole circum - lerence of the mercy seat, met on each side, in the middle; all of which, the Rabbis say, was made out of the same mass without any soldering of parts. Here the Shekinab, or Divine Presence rested, and was visible in the appearance of a cloud over it. From hence the Barhkol is - sued, and gave answers when God was con - sulted. And hence it is that God is said in the Scriptures to dwell between the Cherubim; that is, between the Cherubim on the mercy seat, because there was the Seat or Throne of the visible appearance of His Glory among them, This concludes the degree of R. M. You will now terire with your Conductor, while necessary preparation is made for the suc - ceeding degree.

To avert so dire a calamity from the Craft and the Jew- r ish people, I-fe has enjoined upon us in His Word to deposit the sacred treasures which the people most revere in a secret and secure place, for He has promised us that in three score and ten years he will restore this people to the land which they now inhabit, and He will put it into the heart of a Prince of the House of Judah to rebuild the Temple to His Holy Name, and He will give him a sign as a reward and encouragement for his zeal and fidelity, and the sign shall be the reco$ery of the word. (K. S. turns to H. A., saying:) K. S.—My Wotthy Companion and Master - Builder, have the craftsmen completed the copy of the Ark of the Covenant? H. A.—Illustrious King Solomon, the work has been completed, and I will have the Overseers of the Work place it before you. (H.

Two or four companions bear the Ark and two com - panions follow, one bearing the Pot of Manna and the other Aaron’s Rod.) K.

These are to be deposited here in the security of the Ninth Arch, that the memory of the sacred treasures so much re - vered by our people may not be lost thtough the vicissitudes of time. H. K.

And Moses said unto Aaron, take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept.” H. K. T.—In humble commemoration of that divine command, I now deposit this imitation of that sacred Pot of Manna in this Ark, lest in dine to come the people shall forget how, for fo~rry years, their fathers, led through the wilderness by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, were fed with that manna which fell from heaven, fresh every morning and new every night.

S.—For the information of future gen - erations, should this Temple be destroyed, and its sacted vessels and holy furniture be defiled and dispersed among the nations, I propose that we deposit within the Book of the Law this Key to the characters on the sides of the Ark and engraved on the golden triangle upon the lid of the Ark.

(K. S. pauses a moment with hands uplifted and says:) K. S.—AlIis finished, HISTORY K. S,--In giving the history of this degree, we revert to the building of the Temple. Our three Grand Masters, S., K. of I., H., K. of T. and H. A., being in possession of the writings of Moses and the Prophets, well knew that if the Children of Israel deviated from the laws therein contained, their enem - ies would be let loose upon them, their cities and Temple sacked and destroyed, and all the sacred treasures of the S. S. would be forever lost. In order to prevent this evil, they agreed to erect a secter vault under - ground, leading from K. S.’s most retired apartment and ending under the S. S. of H. This S. V. was divided into nine arches -or apartments. The Ninth Arch was erected by our three G. M’s. as a place wherein to deposit a trne copy of all the holy vessels and sacred treasures contained in the S. S. p above; also, to meet in Grand Council to con - fer the M. M. degree when the Temple should be completed. There were employed on the other eight Arches, twenty-two men from Ge - bal, a city of Phoenicia, together with Ahi - shar and Adoniram, all of whom were well skilled in the arts and sciences generally, but particularly in sculpture. Their hours of labor were from nine at night until twelve, the time when all prying eyes are closed in Page 54 Page 55"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"sleep. During the erection of this Vault, a cir - cumstance occurred which characterizes this degree and upon which the ceremony of initi - ation is founded. One of K. S.’s particular friends, whose name was Z., discovered that there was a se - cret work going on with which he had not been made acquainted, and for a long time he grieved in silence. At length he complained to K. S., and received for an answer, “Be content, friend Z., the time will come when a door shall be open for your reception,”mean - ing that when the Temple should be complet - ed he should receive the M. M. degree. This satisfied him. On e evening, having some particular busi - ness with K. S., he went to his most retired room in search of him, and, finding the door of the S. V. open, and not guarded as usual, by the Steward, Ahishar, who was sleeping at his post, he took it for granted that it had been left open for his reception, whereupon he entered and was dealt with as you have already learned. When the Ninth Arch was completed, our three Grand Masters deposited therein an exact imitation of the Ark of the Covenant, and placed within it an imitation of the Pot of Manna and Aaron’s Rod, and also a true copy of the Book of the Law, or all the writ - ings of the Bible up to that period. That it might be known by whom and for what purpose it was deposited, they placed on three sides of the Ark the initials of their names, and on the fourth, the time when, meaning, “Deposited in the Year of Light 3000, by S. K. of I., H. K. of Tyre, and H. A., for the benefit of the Craft in general, but the Jewish nation in particular.” The M. W. was then placed on the top of the A.,engraved on a triangular plate of gold, on the sides of which, in certain mysterious characters, were er~graved the Key or cover words, by which the M. W. may be revealed. A key to these characters was placed inside the A., in the Book of the Law, so that if the Children of Israel should ever be carried into captivity and remain so long as to forget their mother tongue, yet, on their return, by means of this key, if found, the W. might be restored; and that it might be known and dis - tinguished as the M. W., when found, they placed on the top of the A. their three Jewels, one on each side of the triangle, knowing that a description thereof would be handed Page 57 Page 56"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"down to the latest posterity. Thus was preserved the long lost M. W., now the G. 0. W., or G. and S. N., which R. A. tradition informs us was first communicated by God to Moses at the B. B., and remained in use until near the completion of K. S. Temple. It was then lost at the death of our G. M. H. A., and lay buried in darkness 470 years, when, as you are aware, at the building of the Second Temple, after the Babylonish captivity, through the merits of Jeshua, Ze - rubbabel and Haggai, it was again restored to the Craft, in whose possession we trust it may forever remain. APRON PRESENTATION This apron which you are now wearing is essentially white in color, like the lambskin or white leather apron with which you were presented when you were made a Mason; sym - bolizing that purity of spirit which should mark your conduct, and that uprightness and integrity that should attend your steps. It emphasizes that only by right living will that secretvault which you are now erecting with - in yourself be a fit place in which to deposit Divine Truth. I But this apron is bordered with purple, in - dicating the high rank to which you have at - tained. You have now been admitted into the fellowship of Kings. Purple has ever been the color of Kings, and indicates the power to rule. So the purple of the Select Master indicates the power to rule, not over tempo - ral kingdoms, but over the kingdom of your own life. The lessons inculcated in these degrees have enabled you to advance further in your search for Masonic Light, and have taught you how the better to rule and govern the empire of yourself. Then let this apron ever be to you a sym - bol of a pure heart and the power to rule your life, and your conduct, through the blessings and guidance of the secrets of Divine Truth safely deposited in the hidden vault of your inner consciousness. And, as you wear this apron within the confines of this sacred re - treat, so may you take its symbolism home with you, and ever wear it in your heart and your every day living, so that, when you take your life’s work, that tough Ashlar, which you have polished into the perfect Ashlar, and present it to the Grand Inspector of All, He will take it and say: “This is a beautiful piece of work; true work, square work, such Page 59 Page 58"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"-~ - r as is wanted for the building of the Temple of Humanity.” And when, in due time, your life’s span is o’er, and you find the entrance to the place of wages, refreshment and lest, you may indeed be found worthy, and there receive your reward, the “well done, good and faithful servant,” of the Supreme Master of the Universe. (C. C. clothes Candidate as S. M.) CHARGE TO THE CANDIDATE Companion, having attained to this degree, you have passed the circle of perfection in Ancient Craft Masonry. In the capacity of S. M. you must be sensible that your obligations are increased in proportion to your privi - leges. Let it be your constant care to prove yourself worthy of the confidence reposed in you, and of the high honor conferred, in ad - mitting you to this select degree. Let up - rightness and integrity attend your steps, let justice and mercy mark your conduct; let fer - vency and zeal stimulate you in the discharge of the various duties incumbent upon you; but suffet not an idle or impertinent cutiosity to lead you astray, or betray you into danger. Be deaf to every insinuation which would Page 60 have a tendency to weaken your resolution, or tempt you to an act of disobedience. Be voluntarily dumb and blind, when the exer - cise of those faculties would endanger the peace of your mind, or the probity of your conduct; and let silence and secrecy, those cardinal virtues of a S. M., on all necessary occasions, be scrupulously observed. By a steady adherence to the important instructions contained in this degree, you will merit the approbation of the select num - ber with whom you are associated, and will enjoy the high satisfaction of having acted well your part in the important enterprise in which you are engaged, and now having wrought your regular hours, are admitted to participate in all the privileges of a 5.
