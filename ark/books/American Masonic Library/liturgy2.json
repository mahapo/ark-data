Tirs Liturgy, Monitor or Manual, of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, as that Rite is practiced in the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States, (of which Liturgy the pages that follow constitute the Second Part,) has been prepared by the Sovereign Grand Commander in pursuance of the Resolution on a preceding page, and accords with the Ritual of the Rite approved by The Supreme Council. It is hoped that it may not prove eutirely unworthy of the acceptance and consideration of the Craft, and that it may prove useful to the initiated. Nothing whatever, which it contains, has been copied from any other Monitor, Manual or Book of the Rite; and whatever is the same in it and any other Manual, has been borrowed from it or from the Rituals of the Southern Jurisdiction, by the consent of the Sovereign Grand Commander. ,The part now published will be speedily followed by the others, containing the first, second and third degrees, according to the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and those from the fifteenth to the thirty-second inclusive. It only remains to add that the author has no pecuniary interest in the work, it being published for the benefit of the Supreme Council. In this, as in all else that concerns the Rite, the labor of the Sovereign Grand Commander is its own sufficient reward. ALBERT PIKE Note—Albert Pike made use of both ancient and anglicuzed names in his many works for the Rite. For the King of Tyre and Phoenicia, as well as for the Master Builder he used KhUriTm, Khirum, Khair5m. Huram and Hiram. etc. In his 1883 revisions of works, other than the ~ he seemed to prefer Khair~m for the chosen name. With this clearly unders . the Supreme Council sees no necessity for destroying a significant number of plates merely to substitute Khair5m for Khurum in this 1962 edItion."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE INEFFABLE DEGREES"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Fourth Degree See description on page 12.

Let it also remind you that you have now passed from the Square to the Compasses, as the Geometrician passes from the straight lines and angles by which he measures the surface of the earth, to the great curves and circles by which he calculates the movements of the stars. Begin now to rise above the earth, and climb the skies of spiritual knowledge, for there, and not upon the earth, are Truth and the Lost Word to be found. You see our Lodge clad in mourning, my brother, and the brethren wearing the emblems of grief, for the death of the Master Khirum, and for the eclipse of Light and Truth by the dark, frowning and baleful clouds of Darkness and Error. Grief for the loss of those we love is natural and proper. But we lament not only the death of a friend and benefactor, but also the loss of the True Word, of which we are deprived by his death, and which we have henceforth to seek for until it is recovered. This Lodge represents that of the Sarim of Princes of Israel, held immediately aft?r the death of Khirum, and before his murderers were discovered; when Adoniram, who had been over the levy and tribute, was made Warden and Chief of the Work in his place, for the time, and Azariah ben Nathan was set over the Tribute in the stead of Adoniram; and in his place Jehoshaphat was set over the Seven Princes and Jeroboam was made a Prince and Master to fill the vacancy so created. a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"II SECRET MASTER. 17 And as Jeroboam was then made a Prince in Israel, and a superintendent of the labors on the Temple, so do I now receive and accept you, my brother, as one of the Secret Masters of this, our Lodge, that you may at once engage in the performance of the more exalted duties which your higher rank imposes upon you. Remember that the Princes of Masonry are those who best work and best agree; that no valuable result is to be attained in this world without exertion, and that you have yet many steps to ascend before you can reach the heights on which Truth sits enthroned, and discover the Lost Word, known to the ancient partriarchs. Remember that, as the seven Princes of Israel were under their chief, so you are subordinate to your Chiefs in Masonry; and still more to your country; and most of all and above all, to God; and, therefore prepare yourself to command, by learning to obey. Remember that life is short, and in it there is much to do, and Death approaches, and is nearer and nearer to us at every breath we draw; and therefore loiter not by the way-side, but press onward, up the slopes of the mountain, lest Death overtake and smite you, before you reach its summit. I crown you with this garland of laurel and olive or laurel, emblem of victory and triumph, and sacred to Apollo, God of light. Those who went to consult the Delphic oracle wore garlands of it, as did the Roman Priests on festivals. You march toward an oracle greater than that at Delphi—that of Masonic Truth, which gives no equivocal answers, to mislead and deceive. You now commence the upward course that is to fit you to be Truth ‘s Minister and Priest; and I crown you with the laurel and with the olive, emblem of fruition, in hope. ful expectation of your ultimate success and victory.

They are also symbolical of the contest, in the Universe of things, and in the soul of every man that lives, between Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, Truth and Error, a struggle which commenced with time, and is typified in Masonry by the efforts and anxiety of the aspirant to attain the light. The Eye upon the blue flap of the apron is a symbol of the Sun in the sky, Eye of the universe, and to the ancients an emblem and image of the Deity, the Great Archetype of Light. “Light and darkness,” said Zarathustra, “are the world’s eternal ways.” An eye was the Egyptian hieroglyphic for the word IRI [to perform religious ceremonies], and the second syllable of the name of Osiris, [OSH-IRI], the sun deified, per - sonification of the Principle of Good. You already know how the name of the Master, Khirum, is connected with the same symbol. S S * S S * The East of this Lodge represents the Kadosh-Kadoshim, or HOLY OF HOLIEs, the most Holy Place of the First Temple at Jerusalem, and the most Secret Mysteries of Freemasonry, from which you are now separated by a barrier at present impassible. But you have the key; and some day it will be permitted you to unlock the gate and pass the barrier. Passion, prejudice and error interpose many obstacles between man and the Truth; but there are none that energy and persever - ance, with honest intentions and pure motives, cannot sur - mount.

That Universe is symbolized by us, as it was by the ancient nations, by a circle. The blazing five-pointed star represents the Great Central Light, which so many na - tions have worshiped in the Sun, its representative; and the LETTER, surrounded by its splendors, is the Hebrew Initial of the Name of the Great Source of Light, the True GOD, whom all Masons revere. The Lectures of the Lodge of Perfection are contained in its Liturgy and Legenda, and in the MORALS and DOGMA. By reading and study, you should make yourself familiar with them. LECTURE. For the whole lecture, see “The Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.” These that follow are but extracts: * * * * * * Masonry is a succession of allegories, the mere vehicles of great lessons in morality and philosophy. YoQ will more fully appreciate its spirit, its object, its purposes, as you advance in the different Degrees, which you will find to constitute a great, complete and harmonious system. If you have been disappointed in the first three Degrees, as you have received them, and if it has seemed to you that the performance has not come up to the promise, that the lessons of morality are not new, and the scientific instruction is but rudimentary, and the symbols are imperfectly t~xplained, remember that the ceremonies and lessons of those degrees have been for ages more and more accommodating them - selves, by curtailment and sinking into common-place, to the often limited memory and capacity of the Master and Instructor, and to the intellect and needs of the Pupil and Initiate; that they have come to us from an age when symbols were used, not to reveal, but to conceal, when the commonest learning was confined to a select few, and the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"20 FOURTH DEGREE. simplest principles of morality seemed newly discovered truths; and that these antique and simple Degrees now stand like the broken columns of a roofless Druidic temple, in their rude and mutilated greatness; in many parts, also, corrupted by time, and disfigured by modern additions and absurd interpretations. They are but the entrance to the great Masonic temple, the triple columns of the portico. You have taken the first step over its threshold, the first step toward the inner sanctuary and heart of the temple. You are in the path that leads up the slope of the mountain of truth; and it depends upon your secrecy, obedience and fidelity, whether you will advance or remain stationary. Imagine not that you wiU become indeed a Mason by learning what is commonly called the “work,” or even by becoming familiar with our traditions. Masonry has a his tory, a literature, a philosophy. Its allegories and traditions will teach you much; but much is to be sought elsewhere. The streams of learning that now flow full and broad must be followed to their heads in the springs that well up in the remote past, and you will there find the origin and meaning of Masonry. A few rudimentary lessons in architecture, a few universally admitted maxims of morality, a few unimportant traditions, whose real meaning is unknown or misunderstood, will no longer satisfy the earnest inquirer. after Masonic truth. Let whoso is content with these, seek to climb no higher. Re who desires to understand the harmonious and beautiful proportions of Freemasonry must read, study, reflect, digest and discriminate. The true Mason is an ardent seeker after knowledge; and he knows that both books and the antique symbols of Masonry are vessels which come down to us full- freighted with the intellectual riches of the past; and that in the lading of these argosies is much that sheds light on the history of Masonry, and proves its claim to be acknowledged * * * * * the benefactor of mankind, born in the very cradle of the race."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"SECRET MASTER. 21 To learn, to attain knowledge, to be wise, is a necessity for every truly noble soul; to teach, to communicate that knowledge, to share that wisdom with others, and not churlishly to lock up his exchequer, and place a sentinel at the door to drive away the needy, is equally an impulse of a noble nature, and the worthiest work of man. * * * * * * To attain the truth, and to serve our fellows, our country and mankind—this is the noblest destiny of man. Hereafter and all your life it is to be your object. If you desire to ascend to that destiny, advance! If you have other and less noble objects, and are contented ‘with a lower flight, halt here! let others scale the heights, and Masonry fuI~fl her mission. If you will advance, gird up your loins for the struggle! for the way is long and toilsome. Pleasure, all smiles, will beckon you on the one hand, and Indolence will invite you to sleep among the flowers, upon the other. Prepare, by secrecy, obedience and fidelity, to resist the allurements of both! * * * * * * When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it. It is better thou shouldst not vow than that thou shouldst vow and not pay. Be not rash with thy mouth, let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven and thou art upon earth; therefore let thy words be few. Weigh well what it is you promise; but once the promise and pledge are given, remember that he who is false to his obligation, will be false to his family, his friend, his country and his God The word of a Mason, like the word of a knight in the times of chivalry, once given, must be sacred; and the judgment of his brothers, upon him who vio - lates his pledge, should be stern as the judgments of the Roman censors against him who violated his oath.

King Solomon, having learned that the body of Khirum had been discovered, and deposited in the western part of the unfinished temple, and being greatly rejoiced that the precious remains of his brother, the artificer, were found, immediately ordered Adoniram, who was afterward appointed Chief Architect and Inspector of the Works in his stead, to prepare a funeral that should correspond with the eminent virtues of the deceased. And that the recollection of his sad fate might be more vividly remembered, and the genera] indignation against his murderers not be diminished, he directed that the stains made by his blood upon the floor of the temple should not be washed out, until they should be apprehended and punished for their awful crime. All the workmen upon the temple, on Mount Lebanon and in the quarries, were ordered to be present at the funeral ceremonies. In nine days Adoniram completed a superb mausoleum to the memory of the Master, destined to receive his body; a tomb of white marble, surmounted by a triangu - lar obelisk, of the black marble of Egypt, upon which was a great urn of the same, pierced with a sword. On the urn was carved a branch of acacia, and on its base the letters ~ ...~. In this urn his heart was to be deposited, it having for that purpose been embalmed. This monument was erected in the western part of the temple, rather to the north, marking the spot where the murderers first deposited the body, after they committed the great crime. It being determined not to perform the funeral ceremonies until the monument should be completed, the body was embalmed and placed in a coffin, and kept in an apartment of the temple where it had been the habit of"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PERFECT MASTER. 35 the three Masters to hold their meetings and communicate the mysteries of Masonry, common to the Hebrews and Phcenicians. Three days after the monument was completed, the remains of the murdered Master were deposited therein by King Solomon, assisted by Adoniram and Zabfid, and by all Lhe princes, nobles and captains, and all the workmen, with Khirum King of Tsfir, who had come from his own country to be present at the imposing ceremony. Annually afterward the anniversary of this funeral was religiously observed; and on each such occasion some brother represented the deceased Master, and was thereafter called a Perfect Master, [Morah Salam,] because he was thenceforward required to be, in his character and conduct, a representative of the Master Khirum, whose place he had occupied in the coffin, and worn his clothing and his jewel. And still further to perpetuate the memory of the murder of the Master, a representation of it was thereafter sub - stituted in the Master Mason’s degree, in place of the ceremonies brought by Moses from Egypt, and of those practiced in Phcenicia, all of them emblems of one great truth and leading idea, common to all the ancient nations, and hereafter to be at the proper time unfolded to you. 0 0 0 0 0 0 LECTURE. * * * * * * A desire for our name to be perpetuated to after times by monuments erected by public gratitude, in memory of noble deeds, is a worthy spring of action everywhere, and most of all in a republic.

The record of noble acts. and heroic devotion is more fitly written on the enduring marble, or the pyramid of granite, than on the paper pages of a destructible book. The marble or the granite is itself a book, like those on which the Hierophants of Egypt cut in hieroglyphics the history of the ancient ages. Such monuments regard not alone those to whom they are erected. How noble an office do they not fulfill, in making known to the men and nations of the future, that a people or a fraternity had loftiness of soul enough to appreciate, honor and glorify great deeds! They are the best evidences of the worth of those who erect them; silent exihorters to lofty actions; perpetual teachers of the old lessons of manly virtue and unselfish patriotism. * * * * * * The Master Khirum was an industrious and an honest man. What he was employed to do he did diligently, and he did it well and faithfully. He received no wages that were not his due. Industry and honesty are the virtues peculiarly inculcated in this degree. They are common and homely virtues; but not for that beneath our notice. As the bees do not love or respect the drones, so Masonry neither loves nor respects the idle and those who live by their wits; and least of all those parasitic acari that live upon themselves. For those who are indolent are likely to become dissipated and vicious; and perfect honesty, which ought to be the common qualili - cation of all, is more rare than diamonds. To do earnestly and steadily, and to do faithfully and honestly that which we have to do—perhaps this wants but little, when looked at from every point of view, of including the whole body of the moral law; and even in their commonest and homeliest application, these virtues belong •to the character of a Perfect Master. * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"PERFECT MASTER. 37 We think, at the age of twenty, that life is much too long for that which we have to learn and do; and that there is an almost fabulous distance between our age and that of our grandfather. But when, at the age of sixty, if we are fortunate enough to reach it, or unfortunate enough, as the case may be, and according as we have profitably invested or wasted our time, we halt, and look back along the way we have come, and cast up and endeavor to balance our accouut~ with time and opportunity, we find that we have made life much too short, and thrown away a huge portion of our time. Then we, in our mind, deduct from the sum total of our years the hours that we have needlessly passed in sleep; the working hours each day, during which the surface of the mind’s sluggish pool has not been stirred or ruffled by a single thought; the days that we have gladly got rid of, to attain some real or fancied object that lay beyond, in the way between us and which stood irksomely the intervening days; the hours worse than wasted in follies and dissipation, or misspent in useless and unprofitable studies; and we acknowledge, with a sigh, that we could have learned and done, in half a score of years well spent, more than we have done in all our forty years of manhood. To learn and to do !—this is the soul’s work here below. The soul grows as truly as an oak grows. As the tree takes the carbon of the air, the dew, the rain and the light, and the food that the earth supplies to its roots, and by its mysterious chemistry transmutes them into sap and fiber, into wood and leaf, and flower and fruit, and color and perfume, so the soul imbibes knowledge, and by a divine alchemy changes what it learns into its own substance, and grows from within out - wardly with an inherent force and power like those that lie hidden in the grain of wheat.

King Solomon, in pursuance of his promise made to his ally Khirum, King of Tsiir, gave to him, before the completion of the temple, twenty towns in the province of Galilee. The latter king, coming to Jerusalem to aid in performing the last duties of brotherhood to the Master Khirum, went to see the towns so presented to him; and finding them almost depopulated, and fallen greatly into decay, the country around them uncultivated and sterile, and the inhabitants small in number, and rude and uncivilized in habits and manners, so that the province, in that condition, would be rather a charge upon his treasury than a source of revenue,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"I INTIMATE SEcRETARY. 49 he concluded that his ally, regardless of his royal honor and good faith, had kept his promise in the letter only, while breaking it in the spirit; when, in truth, it was the intention of King Solomon, before putting him in possession, to rebuild and adorn the cities, to place colonies in the country, and to change the waste and inhospitable desert into cultivated gar - dens, fields and meadows; thus making them worthy of his ally’s acceptance, and faithfully complying with his own promise. * * * * LECTURE.

Whether the stars of honor, reputation and reward do or do not shine, in the light of day or in the darkness of the night of trouble and adversity, in calm or storm, that unerring magnet still shows him the true course to steer, and indicates with certainty where-away lies the port which not to reach involves shipwreck and dishonor.

He who is selfish and grasping, or censorious and ungenerous, will not long remain within the strict limits of honesty and truth, but will shortly commit injustice. He who loves himself too much must needs love others too little; and he who habitually gives harsh judgment will not long delay to give unjust judgment. The generous man is not careful to return no more than he receives; but prefers that the balances upon the ledgers of benefits shall be in his favor. He who hath received pay in full for all the benefits and favors that be has conferred, is like a spendthrift who has consumed his whole estate, and laments over an empty exchequer. He who requites my favors with ingratitude adds to, instead of diminishing, my wealth; and he who cannot return a favor is equally poor, whether his inability arise from poverty of spirit, sordidness of soul or pecuniary indigence. If he is wealthy who hath large sums invested, and the mass of whose fortune consists in obligations that bind other men to pay him money, he is still more so to whom many owe large returns of kindnesses and favors. Beyond a moderate sum each year, the wealthy man merely investa his means; and that which he never uses is still like favors u.nreturned and kindnesses unreciprocated, an actual and real portion of his fortune. Generosity and a liberal spirit make men to be humane and genial, open-hearted, frank and sincere, earnest to do good, easy and contented, and well-wishers of mankind."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"INTIMATE SECRETARY. 51 They protect the feeble against the strong, and the defense - less against rapacity and craft.

They are noble by God’s patent, and their escutcheons and quarterings are to be found in heaven’s great book of heraldry. Nor can any man any more be a Mason than he can be a gentleman, unless he is generous, liberal, and disinterested. To be liberal, but only of that which is our own; to be generous, but only when we have first been just; to give, when to give deprives us of a luxury or a comfort, this is Masonry indeed. He who is worldly, covetous, or sensual, must change before he can be a good Mason. If we are governed by inclination and not by duty; if we are unkind, severe, censorious or injurious, in the relations or intercourse of life; if we are unfaithful parents or undutiful children; if we are harsh masters or faithless servants; if we are treacherous friends or bad neighbors or bitter competitors or corrupt imprin - cipled politicians or overreaching dealers in business, we are wandering at a great distance from the true Masonic light. Masons must be kind and affectionate one to another. Frequenting the same temples, kneeling at the same altars, they should feel that respect and that kindness for each other, which their common relation and common approach to one God should inspire. There needs to be much more of the spirit of the ancient fellowship among us; more tenderness for each other’s faults, more forgiveness, more solicitude for each other’s improvement and good fortune. * * * * * * The generous man cannot but regret to see dissensions and disputes among his brethren.

The latter represents the key of the Chief Provost and Judge, wherewith he unlocked the box of ebony that contained the records of the tribunal.

It is said that King Solomon, after the death of the Master Khirum, in order that justice might be administered among the workmen upon the temple, their disputes be decided and their complaints heard, appointed seven Provosts and Judges to adjust their demands, listen to their complaints, and settle any disputes and differences that might arise among them. He appointed Azariah ben Nathan to be the Chief Provost and Judge; Alihoreph and Ahaiah, beni Shaisha, to be Mas - ters of the Records, with the title of “Inspectors;” and four others learned in the laws of Moses, to complete the number and constitute the tribunal. They held their sittings in the middle chamber of the temple, where the records of the tribunal were kept; and there they considered and adjusted the demands and differences of the workmen, and deter - mined all appeals from the judgment of a single Provost and Judge, administering the same laws to the Phcenician as to the Hebrew; and endeavoring to do entire justice, according to the law of Moses, between man and man.

Let that emblem and the Balance - be ever before your eyes, and remind you of the obligation which you have taken in this degree; of the duties which devolve upon you; of the responsibilities which rest upon you, and which, with God’s eye ever fixed on you, you cannot avoid or evade. * * * * S LECTURE. * * * * * Those who are invested with the power of judgment should judge the causes of all persons uprightly and impartially, without any personal consideration of the power of the mighty, or the bribe of the rich, or the needs of the poor. That is the cardinal rule, which no one will dispute; though many fail to observe it. But they must do more. They must divest themselves of prejudice and preconception. They must bear patiently, remember accurately, and weigh carefully the facts and the arguments offered before them. They must not leap hastily to conclusions, nor form opinions before they have heard all. They must not presume crime or fraud. They must neither be ruled by stubborn pride of opinion, nor be too facile and yielding to the views and arguments of others. In deducing the motive from the proven act, they must not assign to the act either the best or the worst"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"PROVOST AND .TUDGE. 61 motives, but those which they wodd think it just and fair for the world to assign to it, if they themselves had done it; nor must they endeavor to make many little circumstances, that weigh nothing separately, weigh much together, to prove their own acuteness and sagacity. * * * * * * Wrong and injustice once done cannot be undone, but are eternal in their consequences; once committed, are numbered with the irrevocable past. The wrong that is done contains its own retributive penalty as surely and as naturally as the acorn contains the oak. Its consequences are its punishment Punishment is not the execution of a sentence, but the occurrence of an effect. It is ordained to follow guilt, not by the decree of God as a judge, but by a law enacted by him as the Creator and Legislator of the Universe. It is not an arbitrary and artificial annexation, but an ordinary and logical consequence; and therefore must be borne by the wrong-doer, and through him may flow on to others. * * * * * * Masonry, by its teachings, endeavors to restrain men from the commission of injustice and acts of wrong and outrage. Though it does not endeavor to usurp the place of religion, still its code of morals proceeds upon other principles than the municipal law; and it condemns and punishes offenses which neither that law punishes nor public opinion condemns. In the Masonic law, to cheat and overreach in trade, at the bar, in politics, are deemed no more venial than theft; nor a deliberate lie than perjury; nor slander than robbery; nor seduction than murder. * * * * * * Let us be just, also, in judging of other men’s motives.

We can rarely say with certainty that this"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"62 SEVENTH DEGREE. man is more guilty than that, or even that this man is very good or very wicked. Often the basest men leave behind them excellent reputations. There is scarcely one of us who has not, at some time in his life, been on the edge of the commission of a crime. Every one of us can look back, and shuddering see the time when our feet stood upon the slippery crags that overhung the abyss of guilt; and when, if temptation had been a little more urgent, or a little longer continued, if penury had pressed us a little harder, or a little more wine had farther disturbed our intellect, dethroned our judgment, and aroused our passions, our feet would have slipped, and we should have fallen, never to rise again. * * * * * * When we condemn or pity the fallen, how do we know that, tempted like him, we should not have fallen like him, as soon, and perhaps with less resistance? How can we know what we should do if we were out of employment, famine crouching, gaunt and hungry, on our fireless hearth, and our children wailing for bread? We fall not because we are not enough tempted! He that hath fallen may be at heart as honest as we. How do we know that our daughter, sister, wife, could resist the abandonment, the desolation, the dis- tress, the temptation, that sacrificed the virtue of their poor abandoned sister of shame? Perhaps they also have not fallen, because they have not been sorely tempted! * * * * * * We shall, therefore, be just in judging of other men, only when we are charitable; and we should assume th~ preroga~ tive of judging others, only when the duty is forced upon us; since we are so almost certain to err, and the consequences of error are so serious. No man need covet the office of judge; for in assuming it he assumes the gravest and most oppressive responsibility. Yet you have assumed it; we all assume it; for man is ever ready to judge, and ever ready to"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"PRovosT AND JUDGE. 63 condemn his neighbor, while upon the same state of case he acquits himself. See, therefore, that you exercise your office cautiously and charitably, lest, in passing judgment upon the criminal, you commit a greater wrong than that for which you condemn him, and the consequences of which must be eternal. * * * * * * On all accounts, therefore, let the true Mason never forget the solemn injunction necessary to be obeyed at almost every moment of a busy life: “Judge not, lest ye yourselves be judged, for whatsoever judgment ye measure unto others, the same shall in turn be measured unto you.” Such is the lesson taught the Provost and Judge. * * * * * TO CLOSE.

The lamented Master Khirum was fond of the society of the young who were eager to learn, and delighted to com - municate to them the arts and sciences which he had studied in the East and in Egypt. His chief favorites were Adoni - ram ben Abada, Joabert, the noble Phcenician, Satolkin of the tribe of Benjamin, Zelec, the Plicenician from Gebal, and Gareb of the tribe of Naphthali, to whom he taught all the learning that he had gathered from the sacred books of the Egyptian priests and of the magi of Persia. He often spoke to me of these, his scholars, saying that when he was dead, they would be able to take his place. He often entrusted to Adoniram the superintendence of the whole work; and he made Joabert the chief artificer in bronze; Satolkin, chief of the workers in wood; Zelec, chief of the stone-masons; and Gareb, chief of the workers in silver and gold, and the engravers.. ...

You still advance toward the Light, toward that star, blazing in the distance, which is an emblem of the Divine Truth, given by God to the first men, and preserved amid all the vicissitudes of ages in the traditions and teachings of Masonry, in all the sanctuaries of initiation in the world. How far you will advance depends upon yourself alone. Here, as everywhere in the world, darkness struggles with light, and clouds and shadows intervene between you and the Truth. When you shall have become imbued with the morality of Masonry, with which you are, and for some time will be, exclusively occupied—when you shall have learned to practice all the virtues which it inculcates—when they have become familiar to you as your household gods—then you will be prepared to receive its lofty philosophical instruction, and to scale the heights upon wiiose summit Light and Truth sit enthroned. Step by step, men must advance toward per - fection; and each Masonic degree is meant to be one of those steps. What if the number is infinite?

The first sign of the degree is expressive of the diffidence and humility with which we inquire into the nature and attributes of the Deity; the second, of the profound awe and reverence with which we contemplate his glories; and the third, of the sorrow with which we reflect upon our insuffi - cient observance of our duties, and our imperfect compliance with his statutes. * * * * * * Masonry utters no impracticable and extravagant precepts, certain, because they are so, to be disregarded. It asks of its initiates nothing that it is not possible and even easy for them to perform. Its teachings are eminently practical; and its statutes can be obeyed by every just, upright and honest man, no matter what his faith or creed. Its object is to attain the greatest practical good, without seeking to make men perfect. It does not meddle with the domain of religion, nor inquire into the mysteries of regeneration. It teaches those truths that are written by the finger of God upon the heart of man, those views of duty which have been wrought out by the meditations of the studious, confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, and stamped as sterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind. It does not dogmatize, nor vainly imagine dogmatic certainty to be attainable. * * * * A Mason’s contentedness must by no means be a mere contented selfishness, like his who, comfortable himself, is indifferent to the discomfort of others.

It is the saddest of a.ll sights upon this earth, that of a man lazy and luxurious, or hard and penurious, to whom want appeals in vain, and suffering cries in an unknown tongue. The man whose hasty anger hurries him into violence and crime is not half so unworthy to live. He is the faithless steward, that embezzles what God has given him in trust for the impoverished and suffering among his brethren. The true Mason must be and must have a right to be content with himself; and he can be so only when he lives ~not for himself alone, but for others also, who need his assistance and have a claim upon his sympathy. “Charity is the great channel,” it has been well said, “through which God passes all his mercy upon mankind. For we receive absolution of our sins in proportion to our forgiving our brother. This is the rule of our hopes and the measure of our desire in this world; and on the day of death and judgment, the great sentence upon mankind shall be transacted according to our alms, which is the other part of charity. God himself is love; and every degree of charity that dwells in us is the participation of the Divine nature.” These principles Masonry reduces to practice. By them it expects you to be hereafter guided and governed. It especially inculcates them upon him who employs the labor of others, forbidding him to discharge them, when to want employment is to starve; or to contract for the labor of man or woman at so low a price that by over-exertion they must sell him their blood and life at the same time with the labor of their hands. * * * * * * These degrees are also intended to teach more than morals.

They hint it only, at least; and their varied meanings are only to be discovered by reflection and study. Truth is not only symbolized by Light, but as the ray of light is separable into rays of different colors, so is truth separable into kinds. It is the province of Masonry to teach all truths—not moral truth alone, but political and philosophical, and even religious truth, so far as concerns the great and essential, principles of each. The sphynx was a symbol. To whom has it disclosed its inmost meaning? Who knows the symbolic meaning of the pyramids? * * * * * * s...

They are summed up in this simple mandate: “Labor to instruct, inform and enlighten the people, and devote yourself to the honor and interests of your country.” * * * * * * Th~~ knife or dagger was, in the middle ages, part of the armor of a Knight; and when the Christian Knights sacked Jerusalem, they smote the miserable Moslems with the heavy sword in one hand, and the broad-bladed dagger in the other. And with it, in the combats a oidrance, the coup de gr&ce was given to a prostrate foe. The Master Khirum is, to the Elu of the Nine, the symbol of Liberty or Freedom, physical or corporeal, mental or intellectual, moral, political and spiritual. Spiritual freedom is freedom from prepossessions, prejudices and errors. It is the independence of the soul, that equipoise which no Breunus or Benedict disturbs by flinging his sword or crosier into the scale, and dictating what shall be done or believed. It is, therefore, the undisturbed and allodial possession of Truth; and without it there can be no genuine freedom of the intellect, or even of the body. Over an ignorant people, tyrants, temporal and spiritual, will inevitably domineer, usurpation, civil or military, will use its ignorance as an instrument and weapon; and it will be enslaved by ambition and by fanaticism or hypocrisy.

It, at least, is entitled to no quarter. The darkness and gloomy shadows of the cavern are a symbol of the shades in which alone ignorance can dwell, since it always flees before the light, which is Truth. The single lamp is Instinct, to which ignorance reduces man, depriving him of the day-light of reason.

It requires its initiates to work, actively and earnestly, for the benefit of their brethren, their coiantry and mankind. It is the patron of the oppressed, as it is the comforter and consoler of the unfortunate and wretched. It seems to it a worthier honor to be the instrument of advancement and reform than to enjoy all that rank and office and lofty titles can bestow. It is the advocate of the common people, in those things which concern the best interests of mankind. It hates insolent power and impudent usurpation. It interposes its hand in war as well as peace, between vengeance and its victims. It pities the poor, the sorrowing, the disconsolate; it endeavors to raise and improve the ignorant, the sunken and the degraded. * * * * * * It is not the mission of Masonry to engage in plots and conspiracies against the civil government. It is not the fanatical propagandist of any creed or theory; nor does it proclaim itself the enemy of kings. It is the apostle of liberty, equality and fraternity; but it is no more the high- priest of republicanism than of constitutional monarchy. It contracts no entangling alliances with any sect of theorists, dreamers or philosophers. It does not know those as its initiates who assail the civil order and all lawful authority, at the same time that they propose to deprive the dying of the consolations of religion. It sits apart from all sects and creeds, in its own calm and simple dignity, the same under every government. It is still that which it was in the cradle of the human race, when no human foot had trodden the ‘II"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ELU OF THE NINE. 89 soil of Assyria and Egypt, and no colornes had crossed the Himalayas into Southern India, Media or Etruria. It gives no countenance to anarchy and licentiousness; and no illusion of glory, or extravagant emulation of the ancients inflames it with an ‘annatural thirst for ideal and Utopian liberty. It teaches that in rectitude of life and sobriety of habits is the only sure guarantee for the con - tinuance of political freedom; and it is chiefly the soldier of the sanctity of the laws and the rights of conscience. It recognizes it as a truth, that necessity, as well as abstract right and ideal justice, must have its part in the making of laws, the administration of affairs, and the regulation of relations in society. It sees, indeed, that necessity rules in all the affairs of man. It knows that where any man, or any number or race of men are so imbecile of intellect, so degraded, so incapable of self-control, so inferior in the scale of humanity, as to be unfit to be entrusted with the highest prerogatives of citizenship, the great law of necessity, for the to re:ain under the control of those of larger intellect peace and safety of the community and country, requires wisdom. It trusts and believes that God will, his own good time, work out his own great and wise it is willing to wait, where it does not see its own way clear to some certain good. It hopes and longs for the day when all the races of men, even the lowest, will be elevated, and become fitted for politi - cal freedom; when, like all other evils that afflict the earth, pauperism, and bondage or abject dependence shall cease and disappear. But it does not preach revolution to those who are fond of kings, nor rebellion that can end only in disaster and defeat, or in substituting one tyrant for another, or a multitude of despots for one. Wherever a people is fit to be free and to govern itself, and generously strives to be so, there go all its sympathies. It detests the tyrant, the lawless oppressor, the military usurper, and him who abuses a lawful power. It frowns"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"90 NINTH DEGREE. upon cruelty, and a wanton disregard of the rights of humanity. It abhors the selfish employer, and exerts its influence to lighten the burdens which want and dependence impose upon the workman, and to foster that humanity and kindness which man owes to even his poorest and most unfortunate brother. It can never be employed, in any country under heaven, to teach a toleration for cruelty, to weaken moral hatred for guilt, or to deprave and brutalize the human mind. The dread of punishment will never make a Mason an accomplice in so corrupting his countrymen, and a teacher of depravity and barbarity. If anywhere, as has heretofore happened, a tyrant should send a satirist on his tyranny to be convicted and punished as a libeler, in a court of justice, a Mason, if a juror in such a case, though in sight of the scaffold streaming with the blood of the innocent, and within hearing of the clash of the bayonets meant to overawe the court, would rescue the intrepid satirist from the tyrant’s fangs, and send his officers out from the court with defeat and disgrace. Even if all law and liberty were trampled under the feet of Jacobinical demagogues or a military banditti, and great crimes were perpetrated with a high hand against all who were deservedly the objects of public veneration; if the people, overthrowing law, roared like a sea around the courts of justice, and demanded the blood of those who, during the temporary fit of insanity and drunken delirium had chanced to become odious to it, for true words manfully spoken, or unpopular acts bravely done, the Masonic juror, unawed alike by the single or the many-headed tyrant, would consult the dictates of duty alone, and stand with a noble ~rmnesa between the human tigers and their coveted prey. * * * * * The true Mason identifies the honor of his country with his own.

The world will never willingly let die the names of those patriots who in her different ages have received upon their own breasts the blows aimed by insolent enemies at the bosom of their country But also it conduces, and in no small measure, to the beauty and glory of one’s country, that justice should be always administered there to all alike, and neither denied, sold or delayed to any one; that the interest of the poor I should be looked to, and none starve or be houseless, ox clamor in vain for work; that the child and the feeble woman should not be overworked, or even the apprentice or slave be stinted of food or overtasked or mercilessly scourged; and that God’s great laws of mercy, humanity and com - passion should be everywhere enforced, not only by the statutes, but also by the power of public opinion.

About six months, it is said, after the execution of the chief assassin, as detailed in the degree of Elu of the Nine, Ben Dekar, an Intendant of King Solomon in the country of Gath, which was a Philistine city tributary to him, caused diligent inquiry to be made if any person had lately taken shelter in that region, who might be supposed to have fled from Jerusalem; and published at the same time. an accurate description of the two miscreants who had made their escape. Shortly afterward he received information that two persons answering the description had lately arrived there, and, believing themselves to be perfectly secure, had remaine~I in the mountain country not far from the city. As soon as Solomon was made acquainted with this cir - cumstance, he wrote to M~kah the King of Gath, to assist in apprehending them, and to cause them to be delivered to persons he should appoint to secure them, and bring them to Jerusalem to suffer the punishment due to their crime. Fifteen Masters, including the Nine Elus, were sent with an escort of troops in quest of the murderers. Five days were spent in the search, when Zerbal, who had borne Solomon’s letter to King Makah, with Joabert and Satolkin, discovered them cutting stone in a quarry, afterward known as that of Ben Dekar. They immediately seized them, and binding them, conducted them to Jerusalem. On their arrival, they were imprisoned in the tower of Akhizar, and the next day were tried and c~nvicted, and received the punishment which their crimes deserved. This degree is devoted to the same objects as those of the Elu of the Nine, and also to the cause of the oppressed against the oppressor, and of toleration against intolerance; that is, to the cause of human freedom, corporeal and mental, against tyranny exercised over the soul or body.

The two assassins of the Master Khirum (who is to us the symbol of that freedom), whose capture and execution are recounted in this degree, are the symbols of those special enemies of freedom, Ambition, of which Tyra?rny or Despotism is born, and Fanaticism, from which spring Intolerance and Persecution.

Toleration, holding that every other man has the same right to his opinion and faith that we have to ours; and liberality, holding that as no human being can with certainty say, in the clash and conflict of hostile faiths and creeds, wbat is truth, or that lie is surely in possession of it, so every one should feel that it is quite possible that another equally honest and sincere with himself, and yet holding the contrary opinion, may himself be in possession of the truth, and that whatever one firmly and conscientiously believes, L~ truth, to him—these are the mortal enemies of that fanaticism, which persecutes for opinion’s sake, and initiates crusades against whatever it, in its imaginary holiness, deems to be contrary to the law of God or verity of dogma. And education, instruction and enlightenment are the most certain means by which fanaticism and intolerance can be rendered powerless. No true Mason scoffs at honest convictions, and an ardent zeal in the cause of what one believes to be truth and justice. But he does absolutely deny the right of any man to assume the prerogative of Deity, and condemn another’s faith and opinions as deserving to be punished because heretical. Nor does he approve the course of those who endanger the peace and quiet of great nations, and the best"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"103 interest of their own race by indulging in a chimerical and visionary philanthropy—a luxury which chiefly consists in drawing their robes around them to avoid contact with their fellows, and proclaiming themselves holier than they. For he knows that such follies are often more calamitous than the ambition of kings; and that intolerance and bigotry have been infinitely greater curses to mankind than ignorance and error. Better any error than persecution! Better any opinion than the thumb-screw, the rack and the stake! And he knows also how unspeak~.bly absurd it is, for a creature to whom himself and everything around him are mysteries, to torture and slay others, because they cannot think as he does in regard to the profoundest of those mysteries, to understand which is utterly beyond the comprehension of either the persecutor or the persecuted. * * * * * * Twenty-four centuries ago these were the Chinese ethics: “The Philosopher” ~Confucius,] “said, ‘San, my doctrine is simple, and easy to be understood.’ Thseng-Tseu replied, ‘That is certain.’ The philosopher having gone out, the disciples asked what their master had meant to say. Thseng - Tseu responded, ‘The doctrine of our master consists solely in being upright of heart, and loving our neighbor as we love ourself.’” About a century later, the Hebrew law said, “If any man hate his neighbor then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to do unto his brother Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother afar off Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” In the same fifth century before Christ, Socrates, the Athenian, said, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” Three generations earlier, Zoroaster had said to the Medians, “Offer up thy grateful prayers to the Lord, the most just and pure Orinuzd, the supreme and adorable God, who thus declared to his prophet Zeradusht, “Hold it not I ELU OF THE FIFTEEN."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"104 TENTH DEGREE. meet to do unto others what thou wouldst not desire done unto thyself; do that unto the people, which, when done to thyself, is not disagreeable unto thee.’” The same doctrine had been long taught among the Hebrews, in the schools of Babylon and Alexandria. A pagan declared to the Pharisee Hillel, th~~.t he was ready to embrace the Jewish relio’ion, if he could make known to him in a few words a summary of the whole law of Moses. “That which thou likest not done to thyself,” said Hillel, “do it not unto thy neighbor. Therein is all the law; the rest is nothing but the commentary upon it.” * * * * * * Masonry requires of its initiates and votaries nothing that is impracticable. It does not demand that they should undertake to climb to those lofty and sublime peaks of a theoretical and imaginary unpractical virtue, high and cold and remote as the eternal snows that wrap the shoulders of Chimborazo, and at least as inaccessible as they. It asks that alone to be done which is easy to be done. It overtasks no one’s strength, and asks no one to go beyond his means and capacities. It does not expect one whose business or profession yields him little more than the wants of himself and his family require, and whose time is necessarily occupied by his daily avocations, to abandon or neglect the business by which he and his children live, and devote himself and his means to the diffusion of knowledge among men. It does not expect him to publish books for the people, or to lecture, to the ruin of his private affairs, or to found academies and colleges, build up librai~ies, and entitle himself to statues. But it does require and expect every man of us to do something, within and according to his means; and there is no Mason who cannot do some thing, if not alone, then by combination and association If a Lodge cannot aid in founding a school or an academy it can still do something. It can educate one boy or girl, at"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"105 least, the child of some poor or departed brother. And it should never be forgotten, that in the poorest unregarded child that seems abandoned to ignorance and vice may slumber the virtues of a Socrates, the intellect of a Bacon or a Bossuet, the genius of a Shakspeare, the capacity to benefit mankind of a Washington; and that in rescuing him from the mire in which he is plunged, and giving him the means of education and development, the Lodge that does it may be the direct and immediate means of conferring upon the world as great a boon as that given it by John Faust the boy of Mentz; may perpetuate the liberties of a country and change the destinies of nations, and write a new chapter in the history of the world. For we never know the importance of the act we do. The daughter of Pharaoh little thought what she was doing for the human race, and the vast unimaginable consequences that depended on her charitable act, when she drew the little child of a Hebrew woman from among the rushes that grew along tht~ bank of the Nile, and determined to rear it as if it were her own. How often has an act of charity, costing the doer little, given to the world a great paix~ter, a great mi’~ian, a great inventor I How often has such an act developed the ragged boy into the benefactor of his race! On what small and apparently unimportant circumstances have turned and hinged the fates of the world’s great conquerors. There is no law that limits the returns that shall be reaped from a single good deed. The widow’s mite may not only be as acceptable to God, but may produce as great results as the rich man’s costly offering. The poorest boy, helped by benevolence, may come to lead armies, to control senates, to decide on peace and war, to dictate to cabinets; and his magnificent thoughts and noble words may be law many years hereafter to millions of men yet unborn.

We must not forget that great results are most ordinarily produced by an aggregate of many contributions and exer - tions; as it is the invisible particles of vapor, each separate and distinct from the other, that, rising from the oceans and their bays and gulfs, from lakes and rivers, and wide morasses and overflowed plains, float away as clouds, and distill upon the earth in dews, and fall in showers and rain and snows upon the broad plains and rude mountains, and make the great navigable streams that are the arteries along which flows the life-blood of a country. And so Masonry can do mQch, if each Mason be content to do his share, and if their united efforts are directed by wise counsels to a common purpose. “It is for God and for Omnipotency to do mighty things in a moment; but by degrees to grow to greatness is the course that he hath left for man.” If Masonry will but be true to her mission, and Masons to their promises and obligations—if, reentering vigorously upon a career of beneficence, she and they will but pursue it earnestly and unfalteringly, remembering that our contri - butions to the cause of charity and education theu deserve the greatest credit when it costs us something, the curtailing of a comfort or the relinquishment of a luxury, to make them— if we will but give aid to what were once Masonry’s great schemes for human improvement, not fitfully and spasmodi - cally, but regularly and incessantly, as the vapors rise and the springs run, and as the sun rises and the stars come up into the heavens, then we may be sure that great results will be attained and a great work done.

HISTORY. 0... The history of this degree is, that after punishment had been inflicted on the murderers of the Master Khiruin, King Solomon instituted it, both as a recompense for the zeal and constancy of the Elus of the Fifteen, who had assisted him to discover them, and also to enable him to elevate other deserving brethren, from the lower degrees to those places in the higher, which had been vacated by their promotion. Twelve of these fifteen he made Sublime Knights,.selecting them by lot, that he might give none offense. The first twelve drawn he constituted into a Chapter, and gave them command over the twelve tribes. He gave them the title of I Prince or Chief, Nasia, and the name Emeth or Ameth, a Hebrew word, signifying a true man. He exhibited to them the precious things brought from the high place Gabaon, to be deposited in the new temple built on the site of the threshing-floor of Ornan or Araiinah, the Jebusite. These, my broiher, are the chief objects delineated on our tracing- board, and you should make them the frequent subject of I your reflections, for each has a profound symbolic meaning. The ninth, tenth and eleventh degrees constitute what are called the Eln or Elect degrees, of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. They elucidate a particular part of the legendary history or mythical traditions of Freemasonry, and constitute a peculiar system which is necessarily contained in every Rite. In the York or English Rite, the Elus are represented only by the Fellow-Crafts sent in search of the murderers, in the third degree. In the French Rite, or Bit Afoder~’ie, they constitute a single degree, the fourth of that Rite, called “Elu.” In some of the other systems of Free- ELU OF THE TWELVE"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"118 ELEVENT II DEGREE. masonry the Ems have been subdivided into numerous degrees; but their purport is always the same—to give the details of the detection, pursuit and punishment, by chosen or elected brethren, of those murderers who stained, with the blood of the Master Khirum, the floor of the Holy House of the Temple. As there is no symbol of Masonry that has not more than one meaning—the first explanation, and even the second or third, being often itself a symbol and enigma—you will not be surprised to learn that the meaning of these degrees has often been mistaken or misrepresented. They were at one time used to conceal the designs of those who, upon the continent of Europe, and especially in France, ‘were plotting revenge for the execution of Charles I. of England. It was then that the name of Romvel [for Cromwell] was given to one of the assassins, and Hobhen [for Bohun, the family name of the parliamentary general the Earl of Essex,] was given to another. It has also been supposed that the Templars used these degrees and concealed themselves under the name of Elus. Khirum has been supposed to represent the last public and acknowledged Grand Master of that Order, and the Nine Elect to represent the eight original founders of it and the ninth Knight who afterward united with them. It is singular that the adherents of the Stuarts should have made Khirum the symbol of royal power and prerogative, since he has always been, as we have informed you, that of human freedom. As an independent legislature is an indis - peusable feature of free institutions, the Elect of the Nine and .,he Elect of the Fifteen shadow forth the two houses, the upper and lower, in which, in modern times, the power of legislation is deposited in all really free governments. Three times three, or nine, is the peculiar number of the Masters; and five times three, the number of the Apprentice multiplied by that of the Fellow-Craft, is appropriate for the more numerous and popular branch, which, fresh from the people,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"119 and elected for short terms, reflects its ~xi1l, and even its fickle and shifting whims and caprices. In the present degree is shadowed forth that other free institution withont which liberty would often be but a name; the trial by jury of twelve men, whose unanimous verdict is necessary to convict of crime.; and also the Council of State of the Execntive Magistrate, who are his constitutional advisers, and responsible to the people and their repre - sentatives for his acts. When Ignorance, Tyranny and Intolerance are confronted by these antagonists, the victory of Right and Truth is certain. * * * * * LECTURE. * * * * The great distinguishing characteristic of a Mason is sympathy with his kind. He recognizes in the human race one great family, all connected ~vith himself by those invisi - ble links, and that mighty net-work of circumstance, forged and woven by God. Feeling that sympathy, it is his first Masonic duty to serve his fellow-man. At his first entrance into the Order, he ceases to be isolated, and becomes one of a great brother - I hood, assuming new duties toward every Mason that lives, as every Mason at the same moment assumes them toward him. Nor are those duties on his part confined to Masons alone. He assumes many in regard to his country, and especially toward the great, suffering masses of the common people, for they too are . his brethren, and God hears them, inarticu - late as the moanings of their misery are. By all proper means, of persuasion and influence, and otherwise, if the I occasion and emergency require, he is bound to defend them against oppression, and tyrannical and illegal exactions.

For though we do not know why God, being infinitely merciful as well as wise, has so ordered it, it seems to be unquestionably his law, that even in civilized and Christian couutries, the large mass of the population shall be for - tunate, if, during their whole life, from infancy to old age, in health and sickness, they have enough of the commonest and coarsest food to keep themselves and their children from the continual gnawing of hunger—enough of the commonest and coarsest clothing to protect themselves and their little ones from indecent exposure and the bitter cold; and if they have over their heads the rudest shelter. And He seems to have enacted this law—which no human community has yet found the means to abrogate—that when a country becomes populous, capital shall concentrate in the hands of a limited number of persons, and labor become more and more at its mercy, until mere manual labor, that of the weaver and iron-worker, and other artisans, eventually ceases to be worth more than a bare subsistence, and often, in great cities and vast extents of country, not even that, and goes or crawls about in rags, begging, and starving for want of work. * * * * * * Blow to deal with this apparently inevitable evil and mortal disease is by far the most important of all social problems.

Masonry will do all in its power, by direct exertion and cooperation, to improve and inform as well as to protect the people; to better their physicei condition, relieve their miseries, supply their wants, and minister to their necessities. Let every Mason in this good work do all that may be in his power. * * * * * * Virtue is the truest liberty; nor is he free that stoops to passions; nor he in bondage that serves a noble master.

He lives truly after death, whose good deeds are his pillars of remembrance; and no day but adds some grains to his heap of glory. Good works are seeds that, after sowing, return us a continual harvest; and the memory of noble actions is more enduring than monuments of marble. * * * * * * t Let the Mason be faithful in the school of life, and to all its lessons! Let him not learn nothing, nor care not whether he learns or not. Let not the years pass over him, witnes8es of only his sloth and indifference; or see him zealou3 to acquire everything but virtue. Nor let him labor only for himself; nor forget that the humblest man that lives is his brother, and hath a claim on hi3 sympathies and kind offices; and that beneath the rough garments which labor wears may beat hearts as noble as throb under the stars of princes."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"ELU OF THE TWELVE. 123 “God, who counts by souls, not stations, Loves and pities you and me; For to Him all vain distinctions Are as pebbles on the sea.” S Truth, a Mason is early told, is a divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue; and frankness, reliability, sin - cerity, straight-forwardness, plain-dealing, are but different modes in which Truth develops itself. The dead, the absent, the innocent, and those that trust him, no Mason will deceive willingly. To all these he owes a nobler justice, in that they are the most certain trials of human equity. Only the most abandoned of men, said Cicero, will deceive him who would have remained uninjured if he had not trusted. All the noble deeds that have beat their marches through suc - ceeding ages have proceeded from men of truth and genuine courage. The man that is always true is both ‘virtuous and wise, and thus possesses the greatest guards of safety; for the law hath not power to strike the virtuous, nor can fortune subvert the wise. * * * * * * To pity the misfortunes of others; to be humble, but without meanness; to be proud, but without arrogance; to abjure every sentiment of hatred and revenge; to show himself magnanimous and liberal, without ostentation and ~ ithout profusion; to be the enemy of vice; to pay homage to wisdom and virtue; to respect innocence; to be constant and patient in adversity, and modest in prosperity; to avoid every irregularity that stains the soul and distempers the body—it is by following these precepts that a Mason will become a good citizen, a faithful husband, a tender father, an obedient son, and a true brother; will honor friendship, and fulfill with ardor the duties which virtue and the social relations impose upon him."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"124 ELEVENTH DEGREE. It is because Masonry imposes upon us these duties that it is properly and significantly styled woric; and he who imagines that he becomes a Mason by merely taking the two or three first degrees, and that he may, having leisurely stepped upon that small elevation, thenceforward worthily wear the honors of Masonry, without labor or exertion, or self-denial or sacrifice, and that there is nothing to be done in Masonry, is strangely deceived.

Every one of us who dies, however useless his life, has been a model of all the virtues, a very child of the celestial light. In Egypt, among our old Masters, where Masonry was more cultivated than vanity, no one could gain admittance to the sacred asylum of the tomb until he had 1)assed under the most solemn judgment. A grave tribunal sat in judgment upon all, even the kings. They said to the dead, “Whoever thou art, give account to thy country of thy actions! What ha.st thou done with thy time and life? The law interrogates thee, thy country hears thee, Truth sits in judgment on thee!” Princes came there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted the history of the dead man’s life, and threw the blaze of the torch of truth on all his actions. If it were adjudged that he had led an evil life, his memory was condemned in the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. What a lesson the old Masonry taught to the sons of the people! Is it true that Masonry is effete; that the acacia, withered. affords no shade; that Masonry no longer marches in the advance-guard of Truth? No. Is freedom yet universal? Have ignorance and prejudice disappeared from the earth? Are there no longer enmities among men? Do cupidity and falsehood no longer exist? Do toleration and harmony prevail among religious and political sects? There are works yet left for Masonry to accomplish, greater than the twelve labors of Hercules; to advance ever, resolutely and steadily; to enlighten the minds of the people, to reconstruct society, to reform the laws, and improve the public morals. The eternity in front of it is as infinite as the one behind.

The degree which you now seek was first conferred upon Adoniram, the son of Abada, when he was appointed Chief Architect of the Temple, and, as such, the successor of the Master Khirum, after having been for a time the chief of the five Intendants of the Building; and after his skill and science as an architect had been thoroughly tested, and he found to be superior to the other four Intendants. It was but the ceremony of his investiiure with that office. Afterwards it became an honorary degree, conferred first upon the other Intendants and then upon the Elus, as a mark of honor and distinction and a certificate of their proficiency as architects. As he advanced, the ancient Freemason ceased to work with the instruments of the laborer, the square, the level, the plumb and the trowel, and assumed those of the architect and geometrician. As he advanced, also, he passed from that branch of geometry and mathematics which occupies itself with the earth, its surface, and the things that belong to it, with right lines and angles, and all the figures formed by these, to the mathematics of the heavens and the spheres.

This is the legend and history of this degree, as it has come to us, partly in the Jewish writings, and partly by Masonic tradition. Enoch, the son of Yarad, was the sixth in descent from Adam, the father of the human race. Filled with the fear and love of God, while the world grew wicked around him, he adored and revered him, and obeyed his laws, and endeavored to lead men in the ways of honor and duty. He dreamed that the Deity appeared to him in visible shape, and said to him, “Enoch, thou hast longed to know my true Name Arise, and follow me, and thou shalt learn it.” TheD ~ In the reign of Solomon. wisest of kings.

Instantly he seemed to be transported from the mountain, and to descend perpendicularly into the earth, passing through nine subterranean apartments, one below the other, and each roofed with arches; in the ninth and lowest of which he saw, upon a triangular plate of gold, surrounded by brilliant rays of light, the same Ineffable Name which he had seen when upon the mountain; and thereupon he awoke. Enoch, accepting his dream as an inspiration, journeyed in search of the mountain which he had seen in his vision, until, weary of the search, he stopped in the land of Canaan, then already populous with the descendants of Adam; and there employing workmen, and, with the help of his son Matusalakh, he excavated nine apartments in the earth, one above the other, and each roofed with arches, as he had seen them in his dream, the lowest being hewn out of the solid rock. In the crown of each roof he left a narrow aperture, closed with a square stone, and over the upper one he built a modest temple, roofless, and of huge unhewn stones, to the Grand Architect of the Universe. Upon a triangular plate of gold, inlaid with many precious gems, he engraved the Ineffable Name of God, and sank the plate into one face of a cube of agate, which he then placed upon a pedestal of white alabaster, in the lowest of the nine apartments. None knew of his deposit of this precious treasure; and that it might remain undiscovered, and survive the flood which, it was made known to him, would soon overwhelm all the known world in one vast sea of ruin, he covered the aperture and the stone that closed it, and the great ring of iron, used to raise the stone, with the granite pavement of"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. 151 his primitive temple. Then, fearing that all knowledge of the arts and sciences would be lost in the universal flood, he built two great columns upon a high hill, one of bronze, to resist water, and one of granite, to resist fire. Upon the granite column he engraved, in the hieroglyphics which Mitzraim afterward carried into Egypt, a description of the subterranean apartments, and of the treasure there deposited; and on that of brass the rudiments of all the arts and sciences then known, and the great truths familiar to the antediluvian Masons. The granite column was overturned and swept away, and worn to a shapeless mass by the great deluge, and the characters upon it wholly obliterated; but that of brass, by God’s providence, stood firm, and was afterward found by Noah, who sought in vain for that of granite, the purport of the inscription upon which he knew from Matusalakh his grandfather, but not the site of the temple or the subter - ranean apartments, to which that inscription would, he knew, have guided him. Thenceforward the true name of God remained unknown, until he said to Moses, in Egypt, when he ordered him to go unto Pharaoh, and cause him to send forth the children of Israel out of Egypt; “I~ that which Iwas and 8hafl be. I am the Aloki of thy fathers, of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob. Thus shalt thou say to the Beni-Israel, HE who is hath sent me unto you.” And afterward he said to him, “I am Yakovak; and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name AZ Shadczi; buL by my name Yakovak I was not known to them.” That Ineffable Name, meaning the Eternal, Self-Existent Being, Independent, Infinite, without beginning, end or change, it~e1f still only the name of the very Deity main - tested as the Creator of all beings and manifested source of emanations, and thus the symbol and key to still another and more occult name not known to the Hebrews alone, Moses engraved upon a plate of gold, and placed this in the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"152 THIRTEENTH DEGREE. ark of the covenant, where it remained for many years, during the whole time of Joshua and part of that of the judges who succeeded him. Forbidden to make known, it is said, its true pronunciation to the people, he communicated it to Aaron and Joshua only; and it was afterward made known to the High-Priests alone, even the kings of Judah and Israel not often knowing it. The pronunciation of Hebrew words not being indicated by the mode in which they were written, could only be communicated orally; and that of this Name was lost among the Jews in the revolutions and disasters that ensued after the death of Joshua and his immediate successors. But the word still remained in the ark, engraved on the plate of gohi; and in the time of Othni-AI the son of Kenaz, younger brother of Caleb, in battle against Kusan-Rasathaim, King of Syria, between the rivers, those who bore the ark were slain by an ambush in a forest, and the ark fell upon the ground. The enemy, attacked and defeated in their turn, were driven from the place before they had time to plunder the ark; and after the battle, the men of Israel, searching for it, were led to it by the roaring of a lion, which, couching by it, had guarded it, holding the golden key in his mouth. Upon the approach of the High-Priest and Levites, he laid down the key and withdrew in peace, allowing them to take away the ark; taught by the Deity himself that the Israelites were his chosen people, entitled to the custody of that which contained his sacred name. Hence, upon the golden key worn by our Treasurer, you see the initials of the words: Ir& ore leonis inveni Verbum; “In the lion’s mouth I found the Word.” When the Pbflistines captured the ark, in the time of Samuel, and Hophni and Phineas, the sons of Mi, were slain defending it, those who took it melted down the plate of gold, and made of it an image of Dagon; and thenceforward no one saw the Ineffable Name until the reign of Solomon, King of Israel."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. 153 David intended to build a Leuiple to God, and prepared much of the material; but bequeathed the enterprise to Solomon, his son. Solomon selected for its site a level plain near Jerusalem; and his workmen commenced to excavate the foundations; but finding the overthrown columns of the Cyclopean Temple of Enoch, and supposing it to have been a place of worship erected to the false gods of the Canaanites, he returned to the place upon Mount Moriah, which had beforetime been the threshing-floor of Oman or Araunah the Jebusite, and which David had purchased from him, and there had erected an altar to Yehovah, while the ark still remained at the high place of Gaba~n. After the death of Khirum, the Master, the two kings refrained from visiting the , in which everything so vividly reminded them of the brother and companion they had lost; and resolved not again to do so, until they should have selected one to fill his place. While they were yet undetermined whom to choose, Solomon proposed to erect an edifice for the administration of public justice, upon the site of the ancient Temple of Enoch; and to that end directed that the fallen columns and the rubbish should be removed. Adoniram, the Chief Architect, with Joabert and Satolkin, two of the Intendants of the Building, were directed to go thither, and survey the ground and lay off the foundations for the proposed building. In doing so they removed some of the shattered fragments of the old broken pavement, and discovered a large ring, attached to a square slab of granite, raising which by their united strength, an aperture was disclosed, like a deep well sunk in the earth. Joabert offered to explore it, and furnish - hag himself with a torch, was lowered into the opening by his companions. After descending for some distance he came to a floor, and discovered in the center of it a slab of granite, with an iron ring, like that above, and raising the slab he saw another aperture, through which he descended to another floor, and thence, in like manner, to another. Weary of his"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"154 THIRTEENTH DEGREE. long suspension, and his torch nearly extinguished, he made known to his companions, by shaking the rope, that he desired to be drawn up. Arriving at the surface, he informed them of his discoveriezs, and his belief that there were other apartments still below. Satolkin then offered to descend; and reaching the third floor, discovered a similar stone and ring, and afterward two others, in succession, and reaching the sixth floor, wearied with exertion, and his torch nearly failing, he gave the signal to ascend, and was drawn up, without discovering that there were still other apartments below the sixth. Adoniram then descended, and passing through three more openings, reached the ninth apartment. As he reached it, his companions dislodged some rubbish above, which, falling upon him, bruised him and extinguished his torch; and he then discovered, in the center of the apartment, a luminous triangular pedestal of white alabaster, hollow, and lighted by an undying fire within; and upon which sat a cube of agate, into one face of which was sunk a plate of gold, thickly encrusted with precious gems that glittered in the light; and enameled on the plate the Ineffable Name of Deity; as the same had been placed there by Enoch, the patriarch. Since the time of Samuel that word had no~ been written in the copies of the law of Moses; but wherever it occurred the word Adonca had bee2 substituted; so that Adoniram knew not the meaning of the Word; but struck with admiration at the sight, astounded at the perpetual light, fed by no human hand for many centuries, and which seemed to him to indicate the immediate presence of the Deity, and penetrated with gratitude to God for permitting him to make so wonderful a discovery, he fell upon one knee and uttered his thanks to that God whom yet he knew only by his names Alokim, Adona~, and Al Skada:, and then, without rising, placed his right hand behind him, and seizing the rope, gave his com - panions the signal, and was drawn by them to the surface. After informing his companions of that which he had seen"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. 155 and discovered, Adoniram proposed that they should pro - cure ladders of ropes, and descend together into the vault, on the ensuing day. To this they gladly assented, and making known to no one what they had discovered, they procured ladders, and returning the next morning, descended together to the ninth apartment. At the sight of the luminous pedestal and cubical stone of agate, Joabert and Satolkin, affected like Adoniram with astonishment, awe and gratitude, fell, as he also did, again, upon their knees, and raising their hands to heaven thanked God for all his mercies, and especially for allowing them to discover these marvels. Adoniram and Satolkin first arose, and seeing Joabert, who was a Phsnician, and originally a stone-mason, from the city of Gebal, still upon his knees, they placed their hands under his arms, and assisted him to rise; Adoniram saying to him, in consequence of their great friendship, “Hamalec Gebalim,” [Chief of the men of Gebal.] Then, examining the cubical stone, and not knowing the meaning of the word upon it, nor, indeed, the characters in which it was written (which only the initiates knew), they resolved to carry it to the two kings, who had then consummated their new and closer alliance; thinking that they might know the meaning of the mysterious word. Ascending, therefore, with the cubical stone, they carefully closed the entranc6, and repaired to the palace, where they found the two kings conferring together. Solomon, imme - diately on beholding the cube and the inscription upon it, exclaimed to tbe King of Tsiir, “My brother, behold the True and Ineffable Name of the Eternal, Self-existent and Almighty God, the Grand Architect of the Universe!” and he and King Khirum both fell upon their knees, raised their hands to heaven, and thanked God for all his mercies, and especially for again allowing them to see his Ineffable Name. Then, rising, King Solomon inquired of the three brethren whence came the marvelous stone; and they thereupon recounted to him their whole adventure, even to the words"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"j 5 f. THIRTEENTH DEGREE. spoken by Adoniram, upon raising Joabert from his knees. Then Solomon, after reflecting for a time, said, “My brother of Tsfir, I remember well to have heard from my father, David, a tradition that the patriarch Enoch, inspired by a dream in which he saw this Sacred Name, and knowing that the world was to be shortly overwhelmed by a flood, made such a vault as this that hath been discovered 1 and there deposited, upon a plate of gold, set in a great agate, the Ineffable Name of God; and afterward engraved upon a granite column, which the flood swept away and wore to a shapeless mass, directions in the sacred characters how to discover the place in which the Ineffable Name was so deposited. None were ever enabled to discover it; but it hath now most certainly been found, and we may now make the Word known to those whose eminent merits shall entitle them to receive it, and be thereby enabled to travel into far countries, even beyond Babylon and Persia, and there receive the high consideration due the Masters in possession of the Great Secret; for it is the true word of a Mason, and the True Name of the Great Architect of the ljniverse, known to thee and me, and to our deceased brother, Khirum, the Master.” Then King Solomon said to the three brethren: “My brethren, the Grand Architect of the Universe has bestowed upon you a signal mark of his favor, by selecting you to be the discoverers of the precious treasure of Masonry. I rejoice with you upon this your great good fortune. Wear henceforth the title of Masons of the Ninth or Royal Arch, as a high honor and order of nobility. I make it a degree in Masonry, which shall hereafter be conferred only as a mark of distinction for eminent services rendered to the State or to Masonry. I have fixed upon a place in which to deposit this Sacred Treasure; and when it is so deposited, you shall be present, and shall then learn the pronunciation of this great and Ineffable Word, and the profound mysteries which it involves.” * * * * * *"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. 157 Afterward the two kings, with Adoniram, Joabert. and Satolkin, deposited the cubical stone in the place prepared for its reception; and the degree of Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason (alias Perfect Elu) was then established, and received by them as the first five members of the Lodge of Perfection; and they were then rewarded by receiving the true pronunciation and explanation of the Sacred Name, and learning the true nature and attributes of the Deity; to whom, until that time, they had ascribed human attributes exaggerated, and a nature assimilated to that of man. After the temple had been completed and dedicated, King Solomon selected the twelve Princes Ameth, the nine most Illustrious Elus of the Fifteen, and Zerbal, who succeeded Adoniram as Master Architect, all of them Masons emi - nently distinguished by their talents and their virtues, and conferred upon them, first the degree of Royal Arch, and then that of Perfection, and assigned them special duties. There were thus twenty-seven Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons (alias Perfect Elu), including the two kings and Adoniram, Joabert and Satolkin. But there were also, it is said, three thousand five hundred and sixty-eight Masons, who had aided in building the temple, and who envied the twenty-five brethren that had been so associated with the two kings. They sent a depu - tation to King Solomon, to lay their grievances before him. He heard them patiently, and mildly answered that the brethren of whom they were jealous had merited the preference shown them, by extraordinary zeal and eminent services; and said, “Your time is not yet come; continue to perform your duty and wait patiently, and in due time, if you are found deserving, you will receive like rewards.” One of the deputation insolently replied, “We are Master Masons, and do not need to receive the higher degrees created for the king’s favorites. We know how the word has been changed, and we will travel as Masters, and as such. earn and receive our wages.”"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"158 THIRTEENTH DEGREE. The king, not moved to anger, answered, “Those for whom the sublime degree of Perfection was first created had deserved it by descending into the bowels of the earth, and bringing thence a treasure inestimable to Masons, and which alone was needed to complete the Temple of the God who is Existence. Go in peace! Do as those brothers did! Let your services in the cause of Masonry be as valuable, your zeal and devotedness as great, as theirs; and I, in my justice, will reward you as amply as you shall deserve.” The delegates, returning, reported to their fellows the replies of the king. Most of these were satisfied, and acknowledged his justice, and endeavored by strict per - formance of their duties to deserve his favor, that they might attain the degree of Perfection. But a small number, vain, jealous, perverse men, determined to explore the ruins, where the treasure had been found, in the hope of making further discoveries; intending, if they found treasures, to escape with them into foreign countries. Accordingly, twenty or more of them went to the ruins, and at day-break readily discovered the iron ring. They raised the stone, and by means of ladders of ropes descended into the vaults, while some of their fellows who had vainly attempted to dissuade them remained at a distance observing them. Only a little time elapsed, when those at a distance watching saw a flame of fire leap into the air, from the cavity, and the sound of an explosion followed, while the earth shook all around, and thick clouds of smoke ascended and hung over the aperture. When these floated away, and all was still, it was found that tbe arches had all been shattered and had fallen in, crushing and burying the rash men who had descended. Thus their haughty insolence met its reward.

Whether the legend and history of this degree are historically true, or but an allegory, containing in itself a deeper truth and a profounder meaning, we shall not now debate. If it be but a legendary myth, you must find out for yourself what it means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrews are not now permitted to pronounce was in common use by Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca and even among tribes foreign to the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a thousand times in the lyrical effusions of David and other Hebrew poets. * * * * * * I We know that for many centuries the Hebrews have been forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that wherever it occurs, they have for ages read the word Adondi instead; and that under it, when the masoretic points, which represent the vowels, came to be used, they placed those which belonged to the latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinary and supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the person, was regarded as an amulet, a protection against personal danger, sickness and evil spirits. We know that all this was a vain superstition, natural to a rude people, necessarily disappearing as the intellect of man became enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason ;— * * * * * * It is noticeable that this notion of the sanctity of the Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient nations. The Sacred Word HOM was supposed by"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"160 THIRTEENTH DEGREE. the ancient Persians (who were among the earliest emigrants from northern India) to be pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught that by its utterance the world was created. In India it was forbidden to pronounce the word AUM or o~, the Sacred Name of the One Deity, manifested as Brahma, Vishna and Seeva. These superstitious notions in regard to the efficacy of thA Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, could, being errors, have formed no part of the pure primitive religion, or of the esoteric doctrine taught by Moses, and the full knowledge of which was confined to the initiates; unless the whole was but an ingenious invention for the concealment of some other Name or truth, the interpretation and meaning whereof was made known only to the select few. If so, the common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of the people, like other errors and fables among all the ancient nations, out of original truths and symbols and allegories misunderstood. So it has always been that allegories, intended as vehicles of truth, to be understood by the sages, have become, or bred errors, by being literally accepted. It is true, that before the masoretic points were invented, (which was after the beginning of the Christian era,) the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known from the characters in which it was written. It was, therefore, possible for that of the name of the Deity to have been forgotten and lost. It is certain that its true pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and therefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the Ine~able Word. The ancient symbols and allegories always had more than one interpretation. They always had a double meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the envelope of the other. Thus the pronunciation of the word was a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were lost, when the knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. 161 faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. That is one interpretation—true, but not the inner and profoundest one. Men were figuratively said to forget the name of God, when they lost that knowledge, and worshiped the heathen deities, and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed their children through the fire to Moloch. Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelites and of the initiates to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegory, in which are represented the general ignorance of the true nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of Judah and Israel to worship other deities, and their low and erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand Architect of the Universe, which all shared, except a few favored persons; for even Solomon built altars and sacrificed to Astarat, the goddess of the Tsidunim, and Malciim, the Aam&nite god, and built high places for Kam&s, the Moabite deity, and Malec the god of the Beni-Aam&n. The true I nature of God was unknown to them, like his name; and they worshiped the calves of Jeroboam, as in the desert they did that made for them by Aar&n. The mass of the Hebrews did not believe in the existence of one only God until a late period in their history. Their early and popular ideas of the Deity were singularly low and unworthy. Even while Moses was receiving the law upon Mount Sinai, they forced Aariin to make them an image of the Egyptian god Apis, and fell down and adored it. They were ever ready to return to the worship of the gods of the Mitzraim; and soon after the death of Joshua they became devout worshipers of the false gods of all the sur - rounding nations. “Ye have borne,” Amos, the prophet, said to them, speaking of their forty years’ journeying in the desert, under Moses, “the tabernacle of your Malec and Kai~.n your idols, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.” Among them, as among other nations, the conceptions of"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"162 THIRTEENTH DEGREE. God formed by individuals varied according to their intel - lectual and spiritual capacities; poor and imperfect, and investing God with the commonest and coarsest attributes of humanity, among the ignorant and coarse; pure and lofty among the virtuous and richly gifted. These conceptions gradually improved and became purified and ennobled, as the nation advanced in civilization—being lowest in the historical books, amended in the prophetic writings, and reaching their highest elevation among the poets. Among all the ancient nations there was one faith and one idea of Deity for the enlightened, intelligent and educated, and another for the common people. To this rule the Hebrews were no exception. Yehovah, to the mass of the people, was like the gods of the nations around them, except that he was the peculiar God, first of the family of Abraham, of that of Isaac and of that of Jacob, and afterward the National God; and, as they believed, more powerful than the other gods of the same nature worshiped by their neighbors—— “Who among the Baalim is like unto theo, 0 Yehovah? “. — expressed their whole creed. The Deity of the early Hebrews talked to Adam and Eve in the garden of delight, as he walked in it in the cool of the day; he conversed with Kayin; he sat and ate with Abraham in his tent; that patriarch required a visible token, before he would believe in his positive promise; he permitted Abraham to expostulate with him, and to induce him to change his first determination in regard to Sodom; he wrestled with Jacob; he shewed Moses his person, though not his face; he dictated the minutest police regulations and the dimensions of the tabernacle and its furniture, to the Israelites; he insisted on and delighted in sacrifices and burnt offerings; he was angry, jealous and revengeful, as well as wavering and irresolute; he allowed Moses to reason him out of his fixed resolution utterly to destroy his people; he commanded the performance of the most shocking and hideous acts of cruelty and barbarity. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh;"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. 163 he repent;ed oi Lhe evil that he had said he would do unto the people of Nineveh; and he did it not, to the disgust and anger of Jonah. Such were the popular notions of the Deity; and either the priests had none better, or took little trouble to correct these notions; or the popular intellect was not enough enlarged to enable them to entertain any higher conceptions of the Almighty. But such were not the ideas of the intellectual and enlightened few among the Hebrews. It is certain that they possessed a knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God; as the same class of men did among the other nations— Zoroaster, Menu, Confucius, Socrates and Plato. But their doctrines on this subject were esoteric; they did not com - municate them to the people at large, but only to a favored few; and as they were communicated in Egypt and India, in Persia and Phcenicia, in Greece and Samothxace, in the greater mysteries, to the initiates. I The communication of this knowledge and other secrets, some of which are perhaps lost, constituted, under other names, what we now call Masonry, or Free or Frank-Masonry. That knowledge was, in one sense, the Lost Word, which was made known to the Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons (alias Perfect Elu). It would be folly to pretend that the forms of Masonry were the same in those ages as they are now. The present name of the Order, and its titles, and the names of the degrees now in use, were not then known. Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back its authentic history with its present degrees, further than the year 1700, if so fGr. But, by whatever name it was known in this or the other country, Masonry existed as it now exists, the same in spirit and at heart, not only when Solomon builded the temple, but centuries before—before even the first colonies emigrated into southern India, Persia and Egypt, from the cradle of the human race.

Infinitely Good, Pitying, Beneficent and Merciful Creator and Preserver of the Universe was the same, by whatever name be was called, to the intellectual and enlightened men of all nations. The name was nothing, if not a symbol and representative hieroglyph of his nature and attributes. The name AL represented his remoteness above men, his inacces - aibL 7 ity; BAL and BAL~&, his might, ALoHIM, his various ~,otencies; IHVH, existence and the generation of things. None of his names, among the orientals, were the symbols of a divinely infinite love and tenderness, and all-embracing mercy. As MOLOCH Or MAI~K he was but an omnipotent monarch, a tremendous and irresponsible Will; as ADONAI, only an arbitrary LORD and Master; as AL Slzadai, potent and a DESTROYER. To communicate true and correct ideas in respect of the Deity was one chief object of the mysteries. In them, Khirum the King, and Khirum the Master, obtained their knowledge of him and his attributes; and in them that knowledge was taught to Moses and Pythagoras. Wherefore nothing forbids you to consider the whole legend of this degree, like that of the Master’s, an allegory, representing the perpetuation of the knowledge of the True God in the sanctuaries of initiation. By the subterranean vaults you may understand the places of initiation, which in the ancient ceremonies were generally under ground. The Temple of Solomon presented a symbolic image of the universe; and resembled, in its arrangements and furniture, all the temples of the ancient nations that practiced the mysteries. The system of numbers was intimately connected with their religions and worship, and has come down to us in MaMonry; though the esoteric meaning with which the num - bers used by us are pregnant is unknown to the vast majority of those who use them. Those numbers were especially employed that had a reference to the Deity, represented hi~ attributes, or figured in the frame-work of the world, in time"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. 165 and space, and formed more or less the bases of that frame - work. These were universally regarded as sacred, being the expression of order and intelligence, the utterances of Divinity himself. The Holy of holies of the temple formed a cube; in which, drawn on a plane surface, there are 4+3+2=9 lines visible, and three sides or faces. It corresponded with the number four, by which the ancients represented Nature, it being the I number of substances or corporeal forms, and of the elements, the cardinal points and seasons, and the secondary colors. The number three everywhere represented the Supreme Being. Hence the name of the Deity, engraven upon the triangular plate, and that sunken into the cube of agate, taught the ancient Mason, and teaches us, that the true knowledge of God, of his nature and his attributes, is written by him upon the leaves of the great Book of Universal Nature, and may be read there by all who are endowed with the requisite amount of intellect and intelligence. This ‘I knowledge of God, so written there, and of which Masonry has in all ages been the interpreter, is the Master Mason’s Word. * * The luminous pedestal, lighted by the perpetual flame within, is a symbol of that light of Reason, given by God to man, by which he is enabled to read in the Book of Nature the record of the thought, the revelation of the attributes of the Deity.

The legend of the columns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical. That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to 8ymbolize the mysteries, of which Masonry is the legitimate successor— from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems and allegories.

If unworthy passions, or selfish, bitter or revengeful feelings, contempt, dislike, hatred, enter here, they are intruders and not welcome, strangers uninvited, and not guests. Certainly there are many evils and bad passsions, and much hate and contempt and unkindness everywhere in the world. We cannot refuse to see the evil that is in life. But all is not evil. We still see God in the world. There is good amidst the evil. The hand of mercy leads wealth to the hovels of poverty and sorrow. Truth and simplicity live amid many wiles and sophistries. There are good hearts underneath gay robes, and under tattered garments also.

You were informed in the Royal Arch degree, that King Solomon builded a secret vault, the approach to which was through eight other vaults or apartments in succession, all under ground, and to which a long and narrow passage led from under his palace; that the ninth vault was immediately under the Holy of Holies of the Temple; that in that apart - ment King Solomon held his private conferences with King Khirum of Tsiir, and the Architect and Master Khirum; and that after the death of the last, the two kings ceased to ‘visit it, resolving not to do so again until they should have selected one to fill his place; and that until that time they would make known the Sacred Name to no one. After Adoniram, Joabert and Satolkin had discovered the cube of agate and the Mysterious Name, as you have heard, and had delivered the cube to King Solomon, the two monarchs, after much deliberation, determined to deposit it in the secret vault, and to permit the three Masters who had discovered it to be present, and then to make known to them what was meant by the true pronunciation of the Ineffable Word, creating a new degree, the last of the Masonry of the First Temple, of which those three Masters and themselves should be the first members, to be called “The Degree of Perfection” [Shelemoth]; and its recipients, “Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons (alias Perfect Elus)."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"PERFECT ELU. 187 Accordingly, after ~otne days, the cubical sione was so deposited in the secret v~rult. Then all knelt, and returned thanks to God for his manifold favors shown to them, and to the Phcenician and Hebrew people. Then the correct pronunciation of the Sacred Name was given to the three Masters, and the degree of Perfection, with its sacred num - bers, its signs, words and tokens, was instituted; and thus the zeal and devotedness of Adoniram, Joabert and Satolkin were rewarded. After the twelve Princes Emeth, the first nine of the Elus of the Fifteen, and the Chief Architect, Zerbal, were admitted to this degree, the nine Elus of the Fifteen were assigned to the duty of guarding the approaches to the secret vault, the eldest being stationed at the entrance of it, and the others respectively at the entrances of the other eight. But that has long been dispensed with in our cere - monies; and three sentinels only are required, each of whom has his especial pass-word. The private entrance to the secret vault having been con - structed by the Master Khirum, with the aid of certain Ph~nician Architects and Masons (alias Perfect Elu), who being initiates of the mysteries, and solemnly sworn to se - crecy as to its existence, had returned to their homes, none others knew of it, except the two kings, and those who were made Grand, Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons (alias Per - I fect Elu). To none others was the True Word communi - cated—all those of inferior degrees knowing only the sub - stitute, adopted at the death of the Master, as the Master Mason’s Word. The temple is said to have been completed in the year 3000, six years, six months and ten days after King Solomon had laid the first stone; and its completion was celebrated with the greatest pomp and the most splendid magnificence. The foundation, we are told in the oldest account, that of the first Book Malakizn, was laid in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, in the month Zif [or Aijar], and the house was finished in the month BM [or Khesvan], of the eleventh year."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"188 FOURTEENTH DEGREE. It was after these ceremonies were performed and the temple dedicated [in the month Ethanim or Tisri,] that Solomon conferred this degree on the twenty-five whom we have mentioned. During three days he gave audience to the brethren. Those to whom he gave the degree he received in the secret vault, exacting from each of them the solemn promise to live in peace and concord; to practice, like their deceased Master, Charity and Beneficence; like him to make Wisdom, Justice and Equity the rule of their life and con - duct; to be profoundly secret as to the mysteries of this degree, and never to confer them on any one who should not have proven himself worthy thereof, by his zeal, fervor and constancy; to assist each other in their labors, distresses, difficulties and calamities; and to punish treason, perfidy and injustice. When they had so promised, he gave them his benediction, and showed them the Ark of the Covenant, in which there was then nothing save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yehovah made a cove - nant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of the Mitzraim. He offered up sacrifice and incense; united with them in a libation; and then, having embraced each, and presented each with a ring, as a token of the covenant which each had entered into with virtue and the virtuous, and bestowed upon them many other marks of honor, he gave them permission to remain at his court, or to travel into far countries in search of knowledge, as they might prefer. The second day he gave audience to all Masons from the degree of Master up to that of Royal Arch. He filled all the vacancies in the different degrees, created by the exaltation of the twenty-five brethren to that of Perfec - tion, and made many honorary members of the degree of Master Architect and the other degrees; engaging them never to forget the principles of honor, uprightness and virtue which they had been and then were taught in the different degrees; always to live united in harmony, and to aid and comfort one another in their necessities and djs."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"PERFECT ELU. 189 tresses. This was done in the Holy of Holies of the Temple. He gave them the jewels and decorations of the different degrees which he conferred; and bound them by solemn obligations to be faithful and discreet guardians of the mysteries of their respective degrees, and never to commu - nicate them to any but the deserving; and having shown them many other marks of favor, he invited them to remain at his court; giving them permission to travel into foreign countries, if they saw fit; and to those who were of Tsi~r to return to their own homes. The third day he devoted to the Fellow-Crafts and Apprentices, raising those of the former, who were worthy, to the degree of Master, and passing such of the latter as deserved it, by fidelity and obedience, to the degree of Fellow-Craft. He caused them to enter into like obligations, and gave them permission to remain at Jerusalem, or to return to their homes, giving the Intendants of the Building orders to furnish them money for their expenses, in case they should see fit to return to their own countries. Afterward this great king, renowned for his wisdom, and long the faithful servant of God, and although be had seen the glory of the Lord fill all the house of the Lord, and Yehovah had twice appeared to him, and warned him against serving other gods, became deaf to the voice of duty; and filled with haughty pride at the glory he had gained, vain of his great I wealth, and intoxicated with flattery, he forgot the lessons which he had taught to others, multiplied the number of his wives and concubines, and gave himself up to shameless and indecent luxury; and yielding to the blandishments of lascivious women, he built temples to the gods of other nations, and profanely offered up to them the incense which should have been offered to the True God alone, in the Holy of Holies of the Temple. These acts of their king and Master covered all good Masons with shame, and afflicted them with the pro - fouDdest grief. Far from following his example, they"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"190 FOURTEENTH DEGREE. lamented his infatuation, and devoted themselves to bringing up their children in the true principles of virtue; pointing them by way of warning to the irregular and shameful life led by the king, as an example to be avoided. But the people, led by the monarch, frequented the temples of the false gods, and sacrificed upon their altars, practicing all the indecent and obscene rites of the worship of Moloch and Astarte. The Masons long contended against this inroad of vice and evil; but finding their efforts unavailing, and remembering the punishment that similar excesses and crimes had often brought upon their ancestors, they foresaw the future desolation of Jerusalem, and the destruction of the temple, and that the descendants of the Jews, a small people in the midst of enemies, and between the two powerful monarchies of Egypt and Assyria, would expiate in captivity the monstrous sins of their fathers; and many of them, under the successors of Solomon, fled into other lands to avoid the impending disasters. They were constrained to be extremely careful as to the admission of new members into the Masonic Order, making merit alone the test of qualification; and the Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons (alias Perfect Elus), especially, received no one until after long probation and by many trials he had been proven worthy. Upon the completion of the temple, many Masons of the inferior degrees, and some of the Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons (alias Perfect Elus) journeyed into other countries. Still more followed them, after the excesses of the king became intolerable; and in a few years the Jewish architects and initiates were to be found in every part of the world. They admitted many into the Order, made known to them its truths, and taught them its duties. For a long time they were wisely cautious to admit none but proper per - sons, who could appreciate the true purposes and objects of the Royal Craft. But by degrees the inferior grades of Masonry, “the lesser mysteries,” their teachings narrowed"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"PERFECT ELU. 191 down, and the symbols so interpreted as to suit the common comprehension, so spread abroad that men were indiscrimi - nately admitted, almost without inquiry, and it was forgot - ten that Masonry was not meant to be a popular but a select and exclusive institution. Improper men gained admission, and unworthy persons even became blind teachers of the blind, trivialized the ceremonies, and substituted common - place absurdities for the profound lessons of wisdom of the ancient sages. It came to be no privilege nor any mark of honor to be admitted to the lesser mysteries; dissensions divided the Lodges; ambition entered into them, coveting rank and titles, the secrets were sold for money, and the Masonry of the multitude fell into merited contempt. But the Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons (alias Perfect Elus) long avoided these errors. They carefully con - cealed their secrets from the vulgar, kept strict watch at the doors of their temples, and refused to multiply their initi - ates. They strove to arrest the downward progress of the fundamental degrees, and refused to confer any degree above that of Master, on those who conducted themselves viciously and unmasonically. But they could not forever close their doors against innovations and irregularities. The mysteries continued to degenerate, and abuses proved both contagious and epidemic. Candidates were admitted in order to gain numbers, or for revenue alone; the degrees were too rapidly conferred, and without a knowledge of the principles or even of the work of the preceding degrees, on the part of the candidates; men of little intellect and information swarmed into the Order, and lowered it to their level; others joined it merely through idle curiosity, and wholly disregarded their obligations; frivolous ceremonies were multiplied, and new degrees invented, and large bodies of men calling themselves Masons threw off their allegiance, pretended to a knowledge of the True Word, without possessing it, and invented new rites; so that the Temple of Masonry became an arena of strife and house of contention. It is the history of human"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"192 FOURTEENTH flEGREE. folly; and the occupation of the present always is to reenact the follies of the past. If the account is legendary only, as to the Hebrew Masonry, it is historical as to the mysteries, all of which fell into decadence by inordinate multiplication of their initiates. The crimes and follies of the Jewish people produced their natural consequences. Immediately upon Solomon’s death his kingdom divided into two, ten of the tribes selecting for themselves a king not of his blood. Israel, under Jeroboam’s successors, continued to decay, until the country was sub - jugated and the people carried into a captivity from which they never returned, nor is it to this day known who or where their descendants are. The descendants of Solomon reigned longer over Judah; but at length, in the reign of Tsad6c-Thu, Nabacadnatzar, King of Assyria, conquered Yehudah, and Jerusalem was destroyed by Nabuzaradan, his general, the temple razed to the ground, and the treasures of the temple, including the great bronze colunius, Yakin and Boaz, with most of the people, were carried away to Babylon. This occurred four hundred and seventy years after the dedication of the temple. Some Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masters (alias Perfect Elus), our legend says, had still remained at Jeru - salem. They had fought bravely in its defense, and many lost their lives on the walls and in the streets, for the siege lasted many months, and there was treachery within the city. After the city was taken by storm, and the palace and tem - ple demolished, they bethought themselves of the secret vault and the inestimable treasure it contained; and feared lest it should have been discovered and the treasure carried away. During the reign of one of the impious descendants of Solo - mon, the secret passage leading to it from the king’s palace had been walled up by the initiates, and the original descent into it from the Holy of Holies opened. Repairing to the ruins of the temple at night, and eluding Lhe parties of the victors that patrolled the streets, they found"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"PERFECT ELU. 193 Lhat the way which led down into the vault had not been discovered, nor the slab of marble that covered it disturbed; but upon that they found the dead body of Galahad, son of Sephoris, chief of the Levites, and an eminent brother of the degree of Perfectiou. He had been entrusted with the custody of the secret vault, and the care of the lamp that burned continually within the pedestal of alabaster, on which lay the cube of agate, having inscribed upon the triangular plate of gold the Ineffable Word. He, like the Master Khirum, who lost his life rather than reveal this word unlawfully, preferred to be buried under the ruins of the falling temple, rather than, by escaping, to risk a discovery of the sacred treasure, never before profaned by unholy hands. Removing the body, and descending into the vault, they erased the sacred letters from the plate of gold, and broke the plate in pieces, placed the cube of agate in a corner of the vault, and covered it with rubbish, extinguished the lamp and overturned the pedestal. Then ascending, they con - veved the body of Galahad into the vault, and laid it down by the overturned pedestal, clad in his Masonic clothing, and wearing the insignia and jewel of a Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason (alias Perfect Elu); and performed over him a brief and solemn ceremony of Masonic burial. Then they reascended, replaced the slab of marble that cov - ered the entrance, and heaped upon it heavy stones and beams of timber, that it might not be discovered until the temple should at some future time be rebuilt. Then they departed, determining not to make known to any one what they had done, except to those who should afterward be permitted to become Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Masons (alias Perfect Elus); and not again to write the Na~me, but to hand it down by tradition only, and that only by its letters, without ever pronouncing the whole word. That practice was afterward observed, when the temple was rebuilt by permission of King Cyrus, and has come down to I"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"194 FOURTEENTH DEGREE. us; the true pronunciation being confided to none but those who receive this degree. Once in each year, it is said the word was repeated by its syllables, in the temple, the brethren forming a circle, and the High-Priest, in the center, repeating the syllables to a brother, who repeated them to the one next him, and so they passed round the circle and returned to the High-Priest; while a great noise was made without the temple, with trumpets and other instruments of music, that none might hear the sacred syllables; and in that manner the true pronunciation has come down to us. Such is the legend of the degree. We do not know that it is, in its details, historically true. We know that some name was cautiously communicated in the temple, in the manner stated; but we do not know why the Hebrew name of God, so well known and commonly used by the patriarchs, should have been forbidden to be pronounced. It is true that its correct pronunciation cannot now be certainly ascertained. We know that the legend has at least one esoteric meaning. It is probable that it has more. To the initiates in all the mysteries were taught the true doctrine in regard to the being, nature and attributes of God, the true history of the creation of the universe, the explanation of the great problem of the existence of suffering and evil, and the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and of a future spiritual existence, in which it would ever advance toward that perfection of which this degree is but a faint and imperfect symbol. In the care taken to conceal the Word from their con - querors and the people, we see that which was habitually taken to conceal these doctrines, hostile as they were to the idolatries and theologies of all the old nations, and to expound and develop them to the favored few alone, who became enrolled among the Masons of this degree. It will be profitable for you to consider the legends of this ~nd the thirteenth degree as an allegory, and to endeavor to penetrate into the heart of it, and know all its hidden"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"PERFECT ELU. 195 meanings. The profoundest things have habitually been concealed in legends that seem baseless and absurd, and language that seems jargon, like that of the alchemists. You must explore the nine mysterious vaults, (a number itself significant and symbolical,) with the lamp of Hermes in yocir hand. After the destruction of the city and temple, some of the Hebrew initiates were carried away as captives into Assyria; otbers escaped into Egypt, Persia, Phcenica, Syria, the desert of the ThebaYd, and even into Greece, Etruria and India. At a later day, in Phcenician vessels, they penetrated into England, Scotland, and Ireland and other European regions. Everywhere they found the mysteries, even in the frozen North, and brethren of the mystic tie in the Magi, the Brahinins, the Druids, the Hierophants of all countries, to whom they were able to make themselves known as initiates. Wherever they went, they carried their own mysteries, substituting in the stead of tbe more ancient legends of a slain God or Hero, that of Khirum murdered by the three symbolical assassins, whose names, like that of the Hero-Architect, were invented to conceal a meaning and a dogma. Everywhere, they commended themselves and their Order to the favorable consideration of princes, nobles, and people, by the purity of its principles, the virtues wbich they practiced, and the great and splendid edifices which they erected. Admitting into their Order good and true men of all ranks and degrees, they were careful not unwisely to multiply the number of those who received the degree of Perfection. Making an artificer and worker in bronze their type of tho principle of good, of honor and incorruptible integrity and fidelity, they paid no regard to rank; but virtue, capacity and intellectual attainments were the sole tests of fitness to receive this degree. From them the Essenes and their great teacher, John I the Baptist, received their pure and profound doctrines; and Philo learned the same in the schools of philosophy of"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"196 FOURTEENTH DEGREE. Alexandria. The same doctrines were held in secret by the Brahmins, the Magi, and the Druids, by Confucius, Zoroaster, Menu, Pythagoras and Plato. The book of Ecclesiastes is the work of an initiate, to mislead the vulgar, hiding the profoundest truths under the semblance of materialism and of a sardonic contempt for human life and human nature. Then came Christianity, making much of the true doctrine public, teaching by allegories and parables, uttering enigmas to divide men into hostile sects, and having its own secret mysteries and institutions and successive degrees. The Jewish traditions and the tenets of the Greek philosophy of the time of Philo and Plotinus were incorporated into the creed of Christianity, by those who followed the first apostles; and the simple and sublime teachings of its founder, largely taken from the old Hebrew books, were overloaded with follies and fictions. The religious mind rioted in the fantastic vagaries of the later gnosticism; and the ilolatry of saints and images recalled to mind the pagan. ism of Rome and the worship of idols under the successors of Solomon. When the powers of Christendom united to conquer Jerusalem and the Holy Land, from the followers of the crescent, the Masons, their traditions, aver, then numerous in every Christian country, eager to participate in the glorious enterprise, enlisted under the banners of different princes. With leaders selected by themselves and known only in the hour of battle, they acted in concert, and were fore - most to scale the walls of Jerusalem, and plant on them the sacred standard of the cross. The Christian leaders and princes, finding that they constituted a particular order, in which all, even to the humblest soldier, were equals, sought to become members of it, and many were admitted, and in due time advanced to the degree of Perfection. New vigor was thus given to Masonry. Carried by those returned from Palestine, into every country, it was protected by the Christian princes, and became a power in every State;"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"PERFECT ELU. 197 everywhere laboring ~o exalt the common people, and so being dreaded, at length, and hated, by all despots in church and state. The chivalric and religious orders became con - nected with it under peculiar circumstances, and new degrees were thus formed and the Order often devoted 1~o new and sometimes to unwise purposes. Everywhere it taught the practice of the noble and heroic virtues; and it continued to exist, in spite of danger and persecution, of the confessional and the inquisition, amid all the revolutions and vicissitudes of empires, the downfall of dynasties, and the overthrow of thrones. It crossed the ocean to America, with those who ffrst began to fell the primeval forests, and made itself a home there, in which to regain all its ancient glories. Under - going many changes in formulas and ceremonies, it divided into different rites, of more or less degrees, practiced in every country—the newest of all manufactured in the new world; but the cardinal principles of Masonry remain unchanged in all the rites.

Neither can be e~ected, except by the dissemination of truth. It is falsehood in doctrines and fallacy in principles, to which most of the miseries of men and the misfortunes of nations are owing. Public opinion is rarely right on any point; and there are and always will be important truths to be substituted in that opinion in the place of many errors and absurd and injurious prejudices. There are few truths that public opinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies; and few errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radiant from the immediate presence of God. There are moral maladies also, of man and society, the treatment of which requires not only boldness, but also, and more, prudence and discretion; since they are more the fruit of false and per - nicious doctrines, moral, political and religious, than of vicious inclinations. Much of the Masonic secret manifests itself, without speech revealing it, to him who even partially comprehends a]] the degrees in proportion as he receives them; and particularly to those wbo advance to the highest degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil, even in the degree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is a Worehip. Masonry labors to improve the social order by enlightening men’s minds, warming their hearts with the love of the I good, inspiring them with the great principle of human fraternity, and requiring of its disciples that their language and actions shall conform to that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, control their passious, abhor vice, and pity the vicious man as one afflicted with a deplorable malady. It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, ~such as God planted it in the heart of universal humanity. No creed has ever been long-lived that was not built on this foundation.

It recognizes the dignity of human nature, and man’s right to so much freedom as he is fitted for; and it knows nothing that should place one man below another, except ignorance, debasement and crime, and the necessity of subordination to lawful will and authority. * * * * * * When despotism and superstition, twin-powers of evil and darkness, reigned everywhere and seemed invincible and immortal, it invented, to avoid persecution, the mysteries, that is to say, the allegory, the symbol and the emblem, and transmitted its doctrines by the secret mode of initiation. Now, retaining its ancient symbols, and in part its ancient ceremonies, it displays in every civilized country its banner, on which in letters of living light its great principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts of kings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and interdiction. * * * * * * We are all of us, though not all equally, mistaken. The cherished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the pure truth of God-; but simply our own special form of error, our guesses at truth, the refracted and fragmentary rays of light that have fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have their day, and cease to be; they are but broken lights of God; and he is more than they. Perfect truth is not attainable anywhere. We style this degree that of Perfection; and yet what it teaches is imperfect and defective. Yet we are not to relax in the pursuit of truth,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"202 FOURTEE1’~TH DEGREE. nor contentedly acquiesce in error. It is our duty always to press forward in the search; for though absolute truth i~ unattainable, yet the amount of error in our views is capablo of progressive and perpetual diminution; and thus Masonry is a continual struggle toward the light. All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most injurious is to entertain unworthy conceptions of the nature and attributes of God; and it is this that Masonry sym - bolizes by ignorance of the True Word. The true word of a Mason is, not the entire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highest and noblest conception of him that our minds are capable of forming; and this word is Ineffable, because one man cannot communicate to another his own conception of Deity; since every man’s conception of God must be proportioned to his mental cultivation, and intellec - tual powers, and moral excellence. God is, as man conceives him, the reflected image of the man himself. * * * * * Masonry, around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, ~he Moslem, the Brahmin, the followers of Confucius and Zoroaster can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God who is above all the Baalim, must needs leave it to each of its initiates to look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the written scriptures of his own religion. For itself it finds those truths definite enough, which are written by the finger of God upon the heart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views of religion and duty, wrought out by the meditations of the studious, confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, stamped as sterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind, commend themselves to Masons of every creed, and may well be accepted by all. The Mason does not pretend to dogmatic certainty, nor vainly imagine such certainty attainable. He considers that"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"203 PERFECT ELU. if there were no written reveiaLlon, he could safely rest the hopes that animate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions of reason and the convictions of instinct and consciousness. He can find a sure foundation for his religious belief, in these deductions of the intellect and con - victions of the heart. For reason proves to him the existence and attributes of God; and those spiritual instincts which he feels are the voice of God iii his soul, infuse into his mind a sense of his relation to God, a conviction of the beneficence of his Creator and Preserver, and a hope of future existence; and his reason and conscience alike unerringly point to virtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose of man’s life. * * * * * * To the Mason, God is our Father in heaven, to be whose especial children is the sufficient reward of the peace-makers, to see whose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; who is ever at hand to strengthen his true worshipers; to whom our most fervent love is due, our most humble and patient submission; whose most acceptable worship is a pure and pitying heart and a beneficent life; in whose constant presence we live and act, to whose merciful disposal we are resigned by that death which, we hope and believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and whose wise decrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an elysium of mere indolent content. * * * * * * The true Mason will not be careful that his name should be inscribed upon the mite which he casts into the treasury of God. It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purity of purpose, in any good cause, he mi~at have contributed to its success; that the ckgree.. in which ho has contributed is a matter of infinitely small concena; and still more, that the consciousness of having so contributed, ih"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"204 FOURTEENTH DEGREE. however obscurely and unnoticed, is his sufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason (alias Perfect Elu) cherish this faith. It is a duty. It is the brilliant and never-dying light that shines within and through the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes the perfect cube of agate, symbol of duty, in - scribed with the divine name of Qod. He who industriously sows and reaps is a good laborer, and worthy of his hire. But he who sows that which shall be reaped by others, by those who will know not of and care not for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and worthy of a more excellent reward. * * * * * The Mason does not dogmatize, but entertaining and uttering his own convictions, he leaves every one else free to do the same; and only hopes that the time will come, even if after the lapse of ages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, and one law alone, the law of love, shall govern God’s whole universe. Believe as you may, my brother; if the universe is not, to you, without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, but hath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as we wear, with humility, and conscious of your demerits and short-comings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect and Sublime Mason (alias Perfect Elu). CLOSING INSTRUCTIONS. Q..• My brother, Paul has said, in his letter to the Chris - tians at Rome, “All that can be known of God is manifest in men; for God hath manifested it unto them.

The sentence of the Book of Genesis, “be light—and light is “—is the cry of victory of the intellect triumphing over the darkness The Eternal Light, like God, commences every day to be, for eyes that open.
