Reed, one of the Custodians of the Work, assumed the responsi - bility of compiling the “Washington Monitor and reemabon s Guide,” and the same was published in 1888. At the Annual Communication of the Grand Lodge in 1892, attention was called to the fact that the supply of our Washington Monitor, printed in 1888, was exhausted. In response to this notice, a Commission was appointed to revise and republish the work; but circumstances ren - dered it impracticable for the Commission to meet and fulfill the duty assigned to it. Again, at the Annual Communication, June, 1893, the subject was considered. The Grand Lodge passed an order committing the work of ANCIENT CEREMONIES HISTORY OF WASHINGTON MONITOR At the Annual Communication of the Grand Lodge of Washington, June, 1886, a resolution was adopted authorizing the Custodians of the Work to publish a printed Manual for this juris - diction, to contain the authorized Monitorial part of the work and lectures oe the three Degrees, as far as practicable, with such additional matter for the use of the Lodges, proper to be printed, as the Custodians should deem advisable."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"S HISTORY revision to the original compiler, with authority to make such additions to the text as in his judg - ment necessity required, and the limitations placed on the cost would justify. The result was the second edition of the “Washington Monitor and Freemason’s Guide,” published in 1893. A third edition was published by authority of the Grand Lodge in 1901; and to render the work more valuable, as authorized by the Grand Lodge, the text was increased with such additional matter as was deemed essential to its more perfect adaptation to the Standard Work of this Grand Jurisdiction. Some additional forms, use - ful for Masonic ceremonial occasions, were in - serted, and desirable changes were made in the arrangement of the contents, and in the form and size of the book. In 1903 a fourth edition was published by Brothers Reed and Taylor, and was practically the same as thethird edition. In 1907 the fifth edition was prepared by the Grand Lecturer and Grand Secretary. It con - formed closely to the fourth edition. A few slight changes were made, however, to make the word - ing correspond with our Standard Work, and the Funeral Seryice was modified for use at cremation. Us, HISTORY Tn June, 1930, following recommendations of the Grand Master, the Grand Lodge adopted a revision of the Monitor as prepared and recommended by the Board of Custodians of the Work, which was published in 1931 as the eighth edition. The ninth edition was published in 1943 as a re - print of the eighth edition, adding slight changes authorized by Grand Lodge, and the Optional Funeral Service which was authorized by Grand Lodge in 1935.

The Holy Bible is dedicated to God; the Square, to the Master; and the Compasses, to the Craft. The Holy Bible is dedicated to God, because it is the inestimable gift of God to man, * * * the Square to the Master, because it is the proper Masonic emblem, of his office; and the Compasses to the Craft, because, by due attention to their use they are taught to circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds. As a more definite guide for a Freemason, the Lodge fur - nishes him with unerring rules whereby he should firn~ his conduct. The Book of the Law is laid before him, that he may not say that through ignorance he errpd. The Rule, the 5~uare and the Compasses are emblematical of the conduct we should pursue in society: To observe punctuality in all our engagements; faithfully and religiously to discharge those important obligations which we owe to God and to our neighhor; to be upright in all our dealings; to keep within bounds those unruly passions which often. times interfere with the enjoyment of society and which degrade both the man and the Freemason. ENTERED APPRENTICE 29 ~AAAAAP ~ ~IIhfr vyvym The ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pave - ment, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star. The Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of Ring Solomon’s Temple; the In - dented Tessel, of that beautiful tesselated border or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is emblematical of human life, check - ered with good and evil; the beautiful border, which surrounds it, of those blessings and com - forts which surround us, and which we hope to obtain by a reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the Blazing Star in the center. r Ii In addition to the three Great Lights of Ma - sonry, there are three Symbolic Lights of a Lodge,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ENTERED APPRENTICE and their situation is represented by the three principal stations: the East, West and South. There is none in the North, because King Solo - mon’s Temple, of which every Lodge is a typical representation, was so far north of the ecliptic that neither the sun nor the moon, at meridian height, could dart any rays into the northern part of the building. The North, therefore, we Mason - ically term a place of darkness. The three lights, like the three principal officer, and the three principal supports, refer, undoubtedly, to the three stations of the sun—its rising in the east,. its meridian in the south, and its setting in the west—and thus the symbolism of the Lodge, as typical of the world, continues to be pre - served. The use of lights in all religious ceremonies is an ancient custom. There was a seven-branched candlestick in the tabernacle, and in the Temple “were the golden candlesticks. five on the right hand and five on the left.” They were always typical of moral, spiritual, or intellectual light. A Lodge has six Jewels: three immovable and three movable. The Immovable Jewels are the Square, the Level and the Plumb. The Square teaches mo - rality; the Level, equality; and the Plumb, recti - tude of conduct. They are called immovable jewels because they are always found respectively in the East, West and South parts of the Lodge, being worn by the officers in those stations. ENTERED APPRENTICE The Movable Jewels are the Rough AshIer, the Perfect AshIer, and the Trestle-Board. The Rough AshIer is a stone as taken from the quarry in its rude and natural state. The Perfect AshIer is a stone made ready by the hands of the workman, to be adju~ted by the working tools of the Fellowcraft. The Trestle-Board is for the Master-workman to draw his designs upon. By the Rough Ashier we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature; by the Per - fect AshIer, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors and the blessing of God; and by the Trestle-Board we are reminded that, as the oper. ative workman erects his temporal building agree - ably to the rules and designs laid down by the Master on his Trestle-Board, so should we, both perative and speculative, endeavor to erect our piritual building agreeably to the rules and de - signs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Great Book of Nature, which is our spiritual, moral and Masonic trestle-board. j •lE 11111111 II IIII5J~ —~~us.— —. —— so r A L"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"RNTERED APPRENTICE 22 ENTERED APPRENTICE 311 Our ancient Brethren dedicated their Lodges to K.

This Tabernacle was a model for King Solomon’s Temple; for which reason all Masonic Lodges are, or should be, situated due east and west. Freemasonry, retaining in its symbolism the typical refer - ence of the Lodge to the world, and constantly alluding to the sun in its apparent diurnal revolution, imperatively re - quires, when it can be done, that the Lodge should be situated due east and west, so that every ceremony shall remind the Mason of the progress of that luminary."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ENTERED A~RENTICE 86 ENTERED APPRENTICE 57 He should be particularly cautious, in all strange and mixed companies, never to let fall the least sign, token or word whereby the secrets of Freemasonry might be unlawfully obtained, ever bearing in mind * * * Entered Apprentices should serve * * * which are hieroglyphically represented by chalk, charcoal and clay.

In addition to observing the law, it will also be your duty to conform to the Rules and Regu - lations of the Grand Lodge in regard to the Work. The Grand Lodge has its own esoteric Work 1 and has a Grand Lecturer to teach it. Evcry Lodge must practice said Work and Lec - tures; any departure therefrom, without express authority from the Grand Lodge, is subject to discipline. The Monitor adopted by the Grand Lodge must ke used, and no other. An inordinate desire on the part of Lodges un - der dispensation to confer degrees results too often in the admission into our Fraternity of some who are not worthy and well qualified. No one should ever be solicited to become a member, and you should bear in mind that the stability of a Lodge depends upon the quality of its members, and not upon the number upon whom its favors are bestowed. As the strength of a chain is that of its weakest link, so the standing of a Masonic Lodge is measured by its weakest member. I especially admonish you to inquire carefully into the character and standing of those who seek ad - mission into our Fraternity. No man can of him - self shed lustre upon Freemasonry nor add to its glory. We confer favors upon those whom we It is your duty, as officers and members, strictly to obey the law.

In this inexorable end of mortality is taught an important lesson, end - lessly repeated: that each of us must, ere long, pass through the valley of the shadow of death. [Very eloquent, my brethren, are the pale, still lips of the dead. With a pathos and impressiVe - ness which no living lips can equal they preach to us sermons that cannot be translated into words.

MASONIC CALENDAR Freemasons, in affi~cing dates to their official documents, have a calendar peculiar to themselves, differing according to various Rites. Masons of the York and French Rites add 4,000 years to the Christian era, calling it ANNO Lucis —YEAR OF THE LIGHT, abbreviated A.~ .L.~.; thus for A. D. 1930, it would be A..L.~.59’30. This is not for the reason that they believe Freemasonry to be coeval with creation, but because of its symbolic reference to the Light of Masonry. In the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite the Jewish calendar is used, adding 3760 years to the Christian era; thus: for A. D. 1930, it would be A.~. M.~. or ANNO MuNDI—year of the world, 5690. Sometimes the Hebrew year is used, which begins on the first of the month Tisri, corre - sponding to September 17th, V. E., using the ini - tials A..H.~.—ANNo HEnEArco—Hebrew year. Royal Arch Masons date from the year in which Zerubbabel began to build the Second Temple, adding 530 to the Christian era; thus: for A. D. 1930, it would be ~ or ANNO II~~?VEN - TIONIS—the year of the Discovery. Royal and Select Masters, when not using the common Masonic date, ANNO Lucis, date from the year in which King Solomon’s Temple was completed; adding 1,000 to the Christian era; thus: for A. D. 1930, it would be AADep.~.2930, or ANr~o DErOSITIONIS—the year of the Deposit. Knights ~Pemplar date from the organization of the order—A. D. 1118.

Except in balloting, the opinions or votes of members should be signified by the raising of the left hand. PARLIAMENTARY USAGE Freemasonry is said to be a law unto itself, or, as Dr. Mackey puts it: “Freemasonry has an organization peculiar to itself.” Applying this to the work of the Lodge, it will be seen that where Masonry comes into conflict with any of the rules of order governing other organizations or so - cieties, parliamentary law, as such, is inappli - cable to Masonic government. _________________________________"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"~1 ADDENDA Every Master, or presiding officer, of a Lodge, in order efficiently and creditably to discharge his duties in the government of the Lodge, should f a - miliarize himself with the well-established princi - ples of parliamentary law; for in doing so he can readily determine a art icular points are ap - plicable to Masonic government. The prerogatives -of the Master and the privileges of the members are the important factors entering into the ques - tion, and a good understanding of these and of parliamentary usage renders easy of solution any problem likely to arise in the Lodge. The business of a Lodge is that which it does chiefly in common with other societies; the work is technically that of conferring degrees and im - parting instruction; the ceremonies, private and public, are among its “rights and privileges” and are peculiar to Masonry. The Master’s preroga - tives, under the established Constitutions of the Fraternity, in wise discretion reach over all, with - out discrimination. In the consideration of any proposition or busi - ness matter before the Lodge, all debate must be conducted with order and decorum, and in ac - cordance with the fraternal principles of the in - stitution. U It is a general rule of parliamentary law that two separate or independent propositions cannot be entertained before a deliberative body at the same time. Rules of order adopted by a deliber - ative body, together with what are known as “subsidiary motions~~ or “privileged questions,”in parliamentary law, regulate debate and govern in the disposition of all questions considered; and when a question is under debate no motion can be received but to adjourn, to lay on the table, for the previous question, to postpone to a day cer - tain, to commIt, to amend, or to postpone indeAn - ADDENDA itely. These several motions take precedence in the order stated. There are other questions an4 recog - nized rules of order governing deliberative dis - cussion, auxiliary to the foregoing and common to parliamentary practice, which need not be mentioned here. Of those repugant to the prac - tice which governs in Masonic Lodges are the following: 1. Adjournment. By the law of Masonry, no motion to adjourn can be entertained; it is out of order and violative of the prerogatives of the Master. At his “will and pleasure” all debate is at an end without motion; so, also, will the Lodge be closed at his “will and pleasure.” 2. Previous question. This is repugnant to Masonry and cannot be entertained. A late dis - tinguished brother, a master in the science of parliamentary law, says: “Freemasonry knows no previous question.” 3. Appeal. No appeal can be taken from the decision of the Master to the body of the Lodge. The Master is responsible “for the good conduct of his Lodge”; the Lodge has no power to over - rule his decision on any question, but the Lodge has its recourse if the Master commits, in its judgment, a flagrant error, by appeal to the Grand Master or to the Grand Lodge. In addition to the foregoing, It is well to under - stand that no such body as a committee of the whole is known to Masonry. The Master, or th~ Grand Master, is, at his “will and pleasure,” ex - officio a member of any committee. Voting by roll call, ezcept in Grand Lodge, is impracticable and very generally inadmissible in a Masonic Lodge, from the nature of its Constitu - tion. See “Balloting,” “Elections,” “Voting,” etc.,.

IMPARTING LECTURES The lectures and explanatory instructions must invariably follow the esoteric work as soon as that is concluded. To defer them is not only de - structive of good impressions, but virtually a breach of fidelity. Ample time shopid be assigned to the work, beforehand, and it must be given in full.
