Pilgrim, these Libations in honor of thes e Illustrious Grand Masters of Ancient Craft Masonry are taken in acknowledgment of ou r connection with, veneration for, and fidelity to that honorable Institution.

When finished: Pilgrim, the twelve burning tapers on the Triangle before you correspond in number with the Apostles of our Savior while on Earth, one of whom by transgression fell, and betrayed his Lord and Master. As a constant admonition to you ever to persevere in the paths of Honor, Integr ity, and Truth, and as a memorial of the apostasy of Judas Iscariot, you are required by the Rules of this Order to extinguish one of those burning tapers. When lights go out: Let this teach you that he who basely violates his vow, or betrays his trust, is worthy of no be tter fate than that which Judas suffered.

When relic is revealed, rise, move down the south side of the Triangle and take skull; Pilgrim, in this sad relic see; what once was man, e’en such as we. In childish innocence he played; al ong the paths of youth he strayed. Having like us, his hopes and fears; Hi s hours of joy, perchance of tears. And when to man’s estate he grew; The feelings we know, he knew. We know not where or when he wrought; What visions dreamed, what aims he sought. Ambitions call he may have heard; Ma yhap, his heart by love was stirred. Or a greed of gold he may have felt; Or at the shrine of passion knelt. /"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Order o f the Te mple - Co mman der 9/8/2002 4 This much we know, and nought beside ; That he was born and lived and died. It may have been his lot to toil; to delve in mines or till the soil. He may have sailed the trackless seas; or felt the heat of dessert breeze. Or a priestly grab he may have worn; or weight of public office borne. But poor or priestly, rich or great; he came at last to this sad estate. With reverence then, behold with me ; That which we all must sometime be; And as we near the dread abyss of de ath; when we shall be like this; But unto those whose faith remains; Death does not sever earthly chains; Our spirit freed from this poor clod; Is but to sleep, to wake with God. Move back to apex: Pilgrim, you here behold an emblem of mortality supported by divinity, a human skull resting on the Holy Bible; which is to teach you that amid all the trials and vicissitudes incident to human life, a firm reliance upon the divine truth contained in this Sacred Volume can alone afford that consolation and peace of mind, which the world can neither give nor take away. Let us attend to another Lesson from the Holy Evangelists. EP You will read the Third Lesson. When finished: We will now participate in the Fourth Libation. The class will please rise. Take cup from the Triangle and direct K to do the same. The class and the active candidate will repe at after me: “To the memory of Simon of Cyrene who was compelled to bear our Savior’s cross.” Participate. Pilgrim, we all have a cross to bear; let ea ch of us so bear that cross that we may be deemed worthy to wear the crown. Wait for wardens to carry. Move to the south side of the triang le, reach over and pick up skull. Behold this ruin! ‘tis a skull, Once of ethereal spirit full. This narrow cell was life’s retreat, Th is space was thought’s mysterious seat. What beauteous visions filled this spot, What dream of pleasure long forgot. Nor joy, nor grief, or hope, or fear, Has left one trace on record here. Beneath this moldering canopy; Once shone the bright and busy eye; Yet start not at the dismal void! If holy love that eye employed, If with no lawless fire it gleamed; But through the dews of kindness beamed, That eye shall be forever bright; When stars and sun are sunk in night. Within this hollow cavern hung; The ready, swift and tuneful tongue; If falsehood’s honey it distained; And wh en it could not praise, was chained; If bold in virtue’s cause it spoke; Yet gentle concord never broke, That silent tongue may plead for th ee; When time unveils eternity. How striking this emblem of Mortality! Once animated like ourselves, but now, behold, it has ceased to act or think; its vi tal energies are extinct, and all the powers of life have ceased their operation! To such a state, Pilgrim turns to side lines and Sir Knights, are we all hastening. Turns back to K.

EC replaces skull and returns to the point of the triangle. Penance Pilgrim, the warfare of the remaining year is now remitted; but, before you can be permitted to participate in the Fifth Lib ation, I must, as a trial of your faith and humility, enjoin upon you One Year of Penance, which you will perform under the direction of our Senior and Junior Wardens. Wait for SW to get into position. You will go forth upon your year of penance clothed in that white robe, points to robe, palm open and up, as an emblem of innocence, SW puts robe on K and steps back to his position. EC moves down south side of triangle and picks up skull, with this human skull in one hand. EC places skull in K’s left hand, facing K. As a symbol of your humility, EC turns slightly to JW who has moved over from his station to passing behind the SW, and hands EC the taper. JW returns to place behind SW & K. And this burning taper in the other. EC places taper in K’s right hand. As an emblem of your faith; which is to teach you that, with fa ith and humility, you should let your light shine before men that they may see your goods work and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Return to apex of triangle, slowly, not turning back on K. Take four steps backward from apex, kneel and uncover. Fifth Libation Set altar, lace curtains and etc. Wh en all is ready, go to station: Sir Knights, FALL IN. When all are in position: Draw, SWORDS; Order, SWORDS. Sir Knights at the triangle, (KNEEL); Rest on, SWORDS. When wardens have K in position, look up and say: Sir Knights, whom have you there in charge? SW waits for CG to finish commands, then answers. EC returns his sword. Pilgrim, your Year of Penance has indeed en ded, but your need of Penitence has not, nor can it end until this mortal shall have put on immortality, for all men err, and erring need repentance. Wait for wardens to get into position. Pilgrim, in granting your request, and ad mitting you a knight among us, I can offer you only a rough habit, coarse diet and severe duty. If on these conditions you still desire to enlist under our Banner, adv ance and kneel at the base of the Triangle. Wardens position K, CG, gives commands. EP moves into position and gives blessing. CG gives carry and recover . When EP is at his station. Pilgrim, we cannot be too ofte n reminded that we are born to die.

Take th is cup in your right hand. Gives cup to K. And repeat after me. Wait for CG to give commands. This pure wine I now take from this cup to remind me of the mortality of the body, and in testimony of my belief in the immo rtality of the soul; and may this Libation appear against me in Judgment to condemn me should I ever knowingly or willfully violate my vow of Knighthood. Partake. K does and hands cup to EC, who takes it. Mo ve back to east with cup, tip remaining drops into chalice, step backward to station and put on gloves. Pilgrim, you have sealed your Faith, and bound yourself by a most solemn pledge to be true to all the vows of this Order. You have invoked a Penalty upon yourself at the Judgment, should you basely betray them. Let the memory of this scene remain with you as vivi d as it is this moment. And should temptation assail you, should misfortune befall you, should a ll the world seem to forsake you, still remain faithful to your Vows of Knighthood. Bring no disgrace upon yourself or upon this Order, nor reproach upon the Name of Him under whose Banner you are now enlisted. Remember, make no promise or pledge under the faith of this, the Sealed Libation, that you do not punctually and scrupulously perform; for any promise made, secret reposed, or engagement entered into , having reference to this Libation, is considered by Knights Templar more sacred and binding, if possible, then any other.

But while you remain faithful to those Vows we give you the mystic assurance of this glittering arch of steel, wave hand upward That these swords with thousands of othe rs, will leap from their scabbards to defend and protect you.

In the hands of a Valiant and Magnanimous Knight of the Temple, it is endowed with three excellent qualities: it’s hilt with Justice impartial, it’s blade with Fortitude undaunted, and it’s point with Mercy unrestrained. Learn from these this im portant lesson; that when you draw your sword, you should be well assured of the Justice of the cause in which you are engaged; being thus assured, press forward with Fortitude undaunted to victory; and having subdued your enemy, regard him no longer as your foe, but extend to him that glorious attribute of Deity, - Mercy. As a Knight Templar, let your honor ever remain as unsullied as this glittering blade, and hold your sword ready to be drawn in the cause to which you have so solemnly consecrated it; hoping ever, and praying always for the advent of that glorious day when “the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains”; when “swords shall be be aten into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks”; when “nations shall not li ft up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more”; when the reign of the Blessed Emmanuel, the Prince of Peace, the Great Captain of our Salvati on, shall become universal and eternal.

Beneath its protecting folds Liberty, Equality and Fraternity have become the heritage of ever y citizen, while the oppressed of many nations have found peace and happiness in the land over which it floats. The flags of mighty empires have come and gone, but the Stars and Stripes remain. Alone of all flags it expresses the sovereignty of the people which endures when all else passes away. Speaking with their voice it has the sanc tity of revelation. He who lives under it and is loyal to it, is loyal to truth and justice everywhere. So long as it flies, government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth. Standard Guard, Return the Flag to its station in the East. Sir Knight, Present, SWORDS!
