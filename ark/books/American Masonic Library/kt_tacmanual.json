REMARKS Thus far the movements have been chiefly legitimate or in accord with the U.

There is some license indulged in, with our display drill that would tot be adrnissable in the School of Cominandery. The movements which follow are in ham-mony with the principles laid down, hut are such as are peculiar to Templars both as to time division of the Commandery and in the display drill As it is not desirable to describe minutely every detail thmst mumay arise in the movements of a Commandemy, time Captain ~f General, or Eminent Commander, will use his discretion in supplying any detail or omission his decision should be tmnal in any case not supplied by the tactics. The Standard Bearer i-nay carry the standaud, dispensing ~NN smith Sword Bearer and Waider, but his movements will he ~mmilar to those of the full guard If the Standard Bearem does not carry the standard the Guam-d should fall in as other 1< nights. Iii display drills the Eminent Commander and Staff ought not to participate as such, it is better that they be absorbed in the ranks. For this reason their movements are not always described, but enough has been given in detail to indicate thmeim proper position. aThe movements by fours, octaves, and platoons, (p p 53—58) are not to be considered as pan of the 7’inibtain- Driti.

Who Commands. “When commanderies appear in public, in their own State ‘or out of it, they are under the immediate authority of the Grand Commander, if he chooses Li assume the command.

But all are under the authority of the Grand Commander in whose jrrmisdiction they may at the timuc be.” IDigesti. It is the custom for tire Grand Captain General to have immediate charge; he is of course undei ~he special or gene- i-ill instructions of the Grand Commander, who cannot be rIt’prived of personal command if he chooses to exercise it. I mideed, rt is difficult to see why the Grand Captain General does not, with equal propriety, assume the gavel of authority in the asylum ~s well as the sword of command in the held. [This remark applies with equal force to the officers of a sub - ordinate commandery] - An officer properly in command, and present, may detail any Knight Templar under him to assist or to give the oral commands, but it would be courteous first to obtain the ac - quiescence of the next in rank. The Grand Conrnraudei’ is recognized, in thi~work, as the chief in command of b~.ttalion. If he divides his command into two or more battalions the Grand Officers, according to rank, should command them, tire Grand Commander directing thc several movements.

The Grand Recorder does the writing at Head Quarters; but as few Grand Recorders have the taste or time to indulge in holiday soldiering, the Grand Wardens are recognized as Adjutant and Sergeant Major. Wlaen Commands are Repeated and Esecuted. ‘Officers in command of wings repeat commands whenever necessary; chiefs of commanderies repeat those, different trom the others, which are to be immediately executed by their cominanderies. In successive movements each chief of commnandem-y gives the command necessary to insure the ex - ecution of the movement by his commandery at the proper time. Commands are executed on hearing them from the Grand Commander. Rank and Position of Commanderisa. “Commanderies——Grarid and Subordinate—take rank ac - cording to the dates of their several organizations, unless they voluntarily waive their proper rank.” [Digest.] They form in order of rank from right to left, and in bat - talion movements are designated, numerically, from right to left, when in line, and from front to rear wIren in column, as ,iirst conimaudery, second conrmaudery, and so on. A SQUADRON is properly two mounted commanderies,bmmt the nomenclature of the order forces the use of division (in U. S. infantry battalion drill, two companies) in the sense of a military platoon; hence we use squadron to indicate two commanderies in the Templar battalion drill, if more than two are present, whether mounted or on foot. In column of squadrons commanderies are designated from the head of the column, and from right to left of each squad - ron, as first comuiaudery, second corn ruaridery first squad- roil, and so on. The numbers of conimanderies and squadrons change when, by facing in the opposite dim ectron, the left becomes SCHOOL OF THE BATTALION. i 59 the right of the line, and the rear the head of the column. If in passing fi-om line mb column, or the reverse, the desig - nation is changed, they hold their last designation until the movement is completed, when the chiefs immediately caution (such) commaudery; so with the squadrons. The ranking officer of the squadron commanda it in col - hum of squadrons, having -egard to the rank of the officer himself, as well as his commandesy (unless he waive his might.) FOR PRACTicE DRiLL lar-ge commnanderies can treat double - sections, or sections, as commanderies, placing the best drilled Knights in command. EquaIizat~ion of Cominanderies.

When the column is passing in ieview, the officeis and standards salute, each commencing sic yards from the re viewing officer, and resuming the carry when six yards past, the Knights in line retain the tarry If the reviewing officer be entitled to it, the trumpets flourish, etc , as befoie explained, and the band continues to play. The drum-major, marching in review, passes the staff be - tween the right aim aiid the body, the head to the front, aiid salutes with the left hand. In saluting, all the officers turn the head’and look toward the reviewing officer, who acknowledges only the salutes of the officer in command and the standards. The officer in command having saluted, places himselt, if mounted, on the right of the reviewing officer, and there remains until his battalion has passed, when he rejoins the bat - talion. The head of the column having executed a second change of directio~m to the left, after passing the reviewing officer, the officer in command commands guide left, and when it arrives on its original ground, wheels it into line, ranks are opened and swords are presented as before; this being acknowledged, terminates the review. ii General pSrades are unfortunately often marred by some one, who seems to have little regard for Well devised plans; among Templars hovsevei, a cheerful obedience to law is expected from all. It requires very little individual effort to conform to rules, and their general observance Would add materially to the pleasure at general gatherings. Commanders of large (Grand) divisions should be informed a month in advance t hat they may give instructions that will insure satinstacrion in everything relating to their division, both in camp and on the march. When Grand Cominanderies are to form for stiect parade, the observance of the following rules is important i. GENERAL HEADO,~UARTERS should be established; its chief and staff prepared at all hours to furnish information concerning existing orders; localities of grand or subordinate commanderies; assignment of quarters for new arrivals, a post office for mailing or distributing letters to individuals (or commanderies), etc; rosters, alphabetically or systematically arranged, so as to be of some use In short, a place where any reasonable demand of “a poor and weary pilgrim” would be met with courteous and intelligent response. 2.

To INSURE ALL THIS, Eminent Commanders should be ordered to report their arrivals at Grand Commandery headquarters, and leave a duplicate list of the Sir Knights with theirqmmand, including the ladies and band accom - panying it; at their own headquarters to keep a register of the locality of the private quarters of each individual. At stated hours every Knight should report at his commandery headquarters, in order that all may feel some confidence in expecting to find their friends tbei-e at that time, or general or special infoimation concerning the paiade, wlaich should be given at ioll call. The Grand Commanders should report at general head - quarters immediately on their arrival Orders should be promptly sent to Grand Commanders, who should require a staff officer to promptly deliver them to subordinate commanders. At the risk of appearing harsh it is asserted and emphasized, that disobedience of lawful orders ought to be followed with prompt and effectual disci - pline. Delay blunts the point of discipline. Nothing wearies men in ranks so much as unnecessary waiting and frequent vexatious halts. This is demoralizing to an army, therofore promptness is the great essential. Let it be understood and felt that the column, announced to move at a given hour, will receive the command to forward march at the time specified, and not a moment later.. At the time lixed for forming, battalions the trumpet sounds and the commanderies march to the battalion pa - rade-grounds If commanderies are to move independently, still the oldest commandery is on the right, formed as prescribed; fifteen yards from its left is the right of the band of the next in rank, and so on Grand Officers in command and their staffs should be mounted, or go on foot. To ride in carriages is not military, nor is it exactly “the thing” for a chief in command. He GENERAL PARADR. 261 takes position in front of the center of the line or on the flank ot the column in drill, etc ,but in a street parade should ride “at the head of the Grand Commandery,” so that the rear of his escort will be fifteen yards from the~b’and of his leading commandery. The Deputy Grand Commander rides at his left; the staff is in their rear fo~med in column of sec - tions, etc. The Grand Standaid Bearer should carry a ‘Tein - plar banner, with the arms or name of the State thereon, if the Grand Standurd is not borne by him. The instant his line is fornied the Grand Cjmmander should send a staff officer to the Grand Master, or the coin - mandei in chief, to inform him of the fact. A bugler should accompany each Grand Coinnaander to sound the attention, forward, halt, etc., that all the coin - manderies may move togetbcr. The commander in chief should also be accompanied by a bugler, and his signals be promptly repeated by each Grand Comnaander’s bugler. Bands near together should never play at the same time. The distance between Grand Divisions (Grand Coinman - deries) should be twenty yards A. Grand Commandery, too small to form a Grand Divis - ion, should join with others and form, according to seniority, as one Grand Division A. maneuver that would retard the rear of the column ought not to be permitted. If tlac Icading commandery, by permissiOn, executes any movement that causes it to lose ground, it should immediately take the double step to regain its distance. Each commandery either shortens or length - ens its steps, Or executes some movement that will enable it to retain its proper place in the column, or cominanderies execute maneuvers successively from the right of Grand Di - visions. A signal from the commander in chief, repeated by Grand Commanders, would enable maneuvers to be com - menced simultaneously on the right of each Grand Division, and followed in succession by commanderies, or simulta -"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"N. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.n] w.stichtingargus.nl w.sfichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nl w.stichtingargus.nl wstichti ngargus.nl \\V ‘it ichringargus.nl ~v Ntichlingargus.nl w .dichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichti ngargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichhingargu s.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nt w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus.nl w. sti chtingargus.nl 262 GENERAL PARADE. neouslv by every commandery in the column, according to previously promulgated orders. Gaps in the column, or the crowding together of grand or subdivision~ should never be permitted, and each command. ing officer ought to caution his subordinates and the guides on these points; complimenting them if they do well, and se - verely Censuring any violation of this rule. Bands should also be instructed to take the full step and- maintain theii proper distances. The carelessness of a single officer or Knight will destroy more of the harmony and beauty of the display than a whole Grand Division can neutralize, ig in - deed, it can be overcome at all.

Withdiaw the band, carry BUGLE SIGNALS. 265 swords, face to the proper front, and the band shotild ciim - mence to play. Baud to cease playing Face the band and give the same signal as for band to play. If it is desired to have the band Commence playing when the commandery present swords, the signal for present swords may answer for both, or the band is instructed to commence the instant swords are presented. THESE should be made a part of the in - struction. The assembly is the signal for forming in ranks, if habitually sounded before forming the coinmandery it will be learned without effort. The signals for drill are taught one or two at a time, until i.ll are familiar with them. A trumpet call embraces both the preparatory and execu - tory commands, which are promptly repeated oially by the officers of subdivisions. Their frequent use will insure quick recognition, and the beauty of the signal drill will then be fully appreciated. Movements to the right are on the ascending chord; cor - responding movements to the left are corresponding signals on the descending chord; and changes of gait are all upon the same notes. A person having “an ear for mu~c” can easily learn to play upon the bugle or tronipet, and the principal signals can 5e learned in a surprisingly short space of time. It requires less study and pratice than is necessary to commit the ritual to memory."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"0 N. stichtingargus.nl N.stichtingarguS.nl N.StichtingarguS.nl w.stichtingargus.ni w.suichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargu s .nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl \\v slichlingargus.nl W sIlchtiflgargus.nI W sttchtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus .nl 266 I3iJGt,E SIGNALS. 1.

There is perhaps no day so appropriate for public recognition by Knights Templars, as A~cension Day. The f6llowing hints far preparation may be of same utility. First. Secure hearty ca-operation. Second Obtain permission of the Grand Commander. This ci Those who take part should know exactly what to do and how to do it. Ta this end same practice would prove beneficial. Fourth. The time and place having been selected, there should l~e no delays which detract much, and tend to neutral - ize good paints. Fifth. The place should be made attractive. The ban - ners decorated with flowers, and the stand and available spaces ornamented with plants, evergreens and flowers. Sixth. Every Sir Knight should have a copy of the Ser - vice, Sevenik. The prelate should wear his official robes, of course, and every officer and Knight be in full dress uniform, except sword and gauntlets, or cuffs. It maybe true that the crusaders attended prayers while arni~ed from head to foot, and that Masons in rebuilding the waste places of Zion, held the sword while they used the trowel because of the dangers that environed them. Yet it does not appear to be in good taste far modern Templars in time of peace, to assemble in F3361 I 337 the House of Gad for warship, whi~c wearing clanging swords to embarrass their movements and mar the solemnity of the occasion. They wear the uniform as the distinctive badge of the order It is an occasion of ceremony as well as religions setivice, hence white gloves are masonically em - blematical, and in good taste. Eight/i Assemble at the rendezvous designated, or Asy lam, and mnrch —right in front—without music to the pl~ce for warship, at the exact moment previously announced. Habitual tardiness discourages the prompt, who thus learn to be laggards and the tardy become more confirmed in this bad habit. AT TIlE As each in succession steps into the vestibule, he will uu - cover without command, (raise the chapeau with the left hand, place it upon the right shotililer and mold it there). Enter in column of files mit about 21 inches distnnce, common time, to march played by the organ; the Commander and staff are iii fiant and march to their places, if in the aisles, they halt and face about The Knights file into thr pews re - served far them and lace to the front If they are to occupy pews on bath sidcs of an aisle, they enter in double column and file right and lefi to theim seats.

A soldier would be punished for attaching unauthotized badges or ribbons to his uniform An aimny officer has too much respect for himself to do so, if it was asot contrary to mu - otamy law and usage. - It is undignified, hence unmilitary, for a Templar to decorate himself with the badges of a numher of Commanderies His own proper jewel and badge of his own Commhndery, or tem - porarily that of the Commandery whose guest he maybe at the time, only should be worn. 0 Human’s Naval Lasso H, Act approved Apiml 03 iSon f DeHarts Military Law, 375 War Department, December ii i5~a REMARKS—The following (consecration of nes~ comnman - dermes and installations) are “ the only formsCand cem’-ernoeiiels sanctioned by the Grand Encampment” [See proceedings s88o, page 266] It is to he hoped that the “sanction xviii be withdrawn at the next triennial conclave The milittury part is so cOntiamy to ammy practice and different from the teachings of this work, that suggested changes are noted in foot notes; not howevem to criticise, but to point out a few of the errors only Forms ~s Published in Grand Encampment Proceedings.

CROWNS Are of various forms, material and signifi - cance, of laurel, olis’e, oak leaves, etc., of gold and precious minerals. The Antmqne Crown has rays or points; is probably the most ancient, worn by kings of antiquity, assigned to gods and deified heroes. Sometimes borne upon shielAs. The shield on cover represents this, and is the shield of an ancient fain - ilv, (Gr.tnt). RINOS am~e considered the emblem of constancy, - eternity, being endless. An attempt was made in Grand Encampment to provide a TEMPLAR’S RING, but it failed to pass. It was to have a Templar Cross, with the letters P. D. E. P., Pro Deo E~ .Patria (for God and Coun - try) between the arms. R&NNERS. The BEAUSEANT, so called from the war- cry of Templars. Half black to indicate death to foes, whom it did dismay and confound. White, to encourage friends, typifying purity, etc. PENNONS were carried by individual knights, displayed from their lances, being either swal - low tailed or pointed, bearing his personal en sign. (See cover of this book, one bearing a family crest, the other a Cross.) 4 STABS. The number of their points have different significations. In lodge /ive points; on bald- rick nine, the number of the founders of the order. 7’ APPENDIX. OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. The time has not come when radical changes in the Tactics~ of semi-military orders can successfully be made to conform wholly with the new Drill Regulations of the Army. Yet it is no doubt very desirable to make some effort looking to m.iltimnate adoption and use of the national drill. This may be more speedily and satisfactorily accomplished by subordi. nate bodies takinm~ the initiative in practicimig the new drill, substituting ml for old methods ~as fasi as their conditions will permit, if it shall appear to be desii able, which .may f~mrly he doubted, at least for the present. Wimli this in view and in order that those who ar,e not pre - pared to abandon all the forms to which they have been accustomed, the body of.thms work is left substantially intact, exce~)ting changes that seemed to be imperative, which are inserted in the text, while others from the army drill will be found in the following pages, which contain instructions that will enable those who desmie to “keep up with the march” of piogress, to ad~mpt themselves to fundamental prmncmples of the new order of things (4631"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"p - w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus.nL w.stichtingargus.n I w. stichtingargus .n I w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichtingargus .n I w.stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w.stichti ngargus. n I w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichti ngargus.nl w.stichtingargus .nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nl w. stichtingargu s.nI w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargus.nl w.stichtingargus.nI w. stichtingargu s.nI w. stichtingargu s.n I 464 INFANTRY DRILL REOULATIONS. It will be understood that many of the Templam movements are unknown to the army drill, and many of the display movements are really adaptations of old battalion maneavems. If grand jurisdictions prefer to use the changes heme noted as being peculiar to the new army drill, that can be presciibed in orders When the aimy drill becomes settled, and somewhat famil - iar, it will be time enough to revise the Templar drill to con - foim to it mor6 closely. EXPLANATORY. PACE. Meaning a thirty inch step, is substituted for “yard and may he so used in almost every place where it occurs in the tactics. -, I’ILE. Is noiv (in the army drill) explained to mean two men, a front rank man and a corresponding man in the rear rank, whether placed one behind tIme other or side hy side. Afi/e is said to be blank when it has no rear iank man. When troops are in one rank the men are frequently termed files, and tIme word is so used in the Templar tactics without regard to the number of ramiks. See Nomenclattire, page mm As YOU WERE. Is a command used when the execution of a movement is improperly begun, or the instructor wishes to begin anew, for any purpose - When given, the movement ceases and the former position is resumed~ at once, without confusion. STEADY. Is a command to correct wavering, or inattention. When given, every Sir Knight will .be careful to observe his own position, correct it if not right and renew his attention. This however is not in the army drill STEP. At this command the fraters glance toward the side of the guide, or take the step and cast their eyes to the front. ttANTP.Y DRiLL R1~OW. 1 ATIONI 465 ~prn• Detaila ~on~ Army D~l, witii W32~G~a Tern 1~YMVAu are 22.011 1.~ &OOOrd Nsvu,—’f lie mimobmi of mtm~ rIi~e¶rIPha Lnri’eepoilct with It,, t,mmHlIC?a teehe mergln of tIme msetics~rmck,ti, ~ Is l’erssitiee.a refer is tIme ~ of tectic,, \\V~rde 1mm precast writer’, sxslanetlssa or etiggeetisima.

The first motion of a signal, or sound of the bugle (or trumpet) fixes th(~ attention, and the last motion or sound of the signal, like the command of execution, causes the com - mencement of the movement.
