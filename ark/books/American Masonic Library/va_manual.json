THE CONSTITUTION OLt MASONRY, OR AHIMAN REZON. * When during the reign of Atheistane, his brother Prince Edwin, of glorious memory, obtained from the King a Free Patent or Charter to Masons, imparting a “Power to regulate themselves, to amend what might happen amiss, and to hold a yearly com - munication in General Assembly,” he accordingly summoned all the Free and Accepted Masons in the realm to meet him in congregation at York, who came and formed the Grand Lodge under him as their first Grand Master, Anno Domini 926. At this congregation Edwin required them to produce as far as practicable all old writings and records of the Craft containing the ancient Gothic Constitutions, and we have authentic record for the fact that they brought many old writings, some in Greek, some in Latin, some in French, and other languages, and from the contents thereof they framed the Constitutions of the English Lodges, and made a law for themselves to preserve and observe the same for all time to come. ‘This is the Masonic title for the Book of Constitutions. It is derived from three Hebrew words ahi,,s, brothers, ,,sanah, to prepare and ratzo,s, the will of law; and dgmfiea thetefore literally “the law of prepared irothers.” It contains the rules and regulations of the Order, an exposition of the duties of officers, the tights of mem - bers, the detail of ceremonies to he ,ised on various occasions, such as consccra - dons, installations, funerals, etc.; and, in fine, a summary of all the fundamental prin - dples of Masonry To this hook, reference is to he made in all cases, where the by - laws of the Grand Lodge are silent or not sufficiently explicii.—Mackev’s Lexicon of Prea Masonry."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 3 2 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY This Constitution, we have good reason to believe, continued the supreme law among the Fraternity, wheresoever dispersed, down to the year 1721, September 29, at which time, as the records show, his Grace John Montague, Duke of Montagu, being Grand Master, and with the Grand Lodge, finding fault with all the copies of the old Gothic Constitutions, ordered Brother James Anderson, A. M., Grand Senior Warden, to digest the same in a new and better form and method; and at a session of the Grand Lodge on 27th December, 1721, said Grand Master Montagu presiding, at the desire of the Grand Lodge, appointed fourteen learned brothers to examine Brother Anderson’s manu - script of the Constitution Book, and to make report. And this communication was made very interesting by the lectures of some old Masons. In Grand Lodge at the Fountain tavern in the Strand, in Ample Foim, 25th March, 1722, his Grace the Duke of Montagu presiding, Right Worshipful John Beal, M. D., Deputy Grand Master, Josiah Villeneau, Grand Senior Warden, and John Morrice as Grand Junior.Warden, and the representative of twenty-four Lodges. The said committee of fourteen reported that they had perused Brother Anderson’s manuscript of the history, charges, regu - lations, and Master’s songs, and after some amendments, had approved of the same; upon which the Grand Lodge desired to the Most Worshipful Grand Master to order the following to be printed, which was accordingly done, and has, with very slight modifications, continued to this day as the Constitution and Regulations of Ancient Free and Accepted Masonry and under which the Grand Lodge of Virginia was instituted. Worshipful Brother Albert G. Mackey, in his truly valuable Lexicon, gives the following impressive meaning to the Book of Constitutions: “The book containing the system of laws and customs of the Fraternity, it is the same as the Ahiman Rezon. Ii is among the charges to a newly in - stalled Master of a Lodge that be is to search the Book of Constitutions at all times, and cause it to be read in his Lodge, that none may pretend ignorance of the excellent precepts it contains. This book, guarded by the Tiler’s sword, constitutes the emblem in the Master’s degree intended to ad - monish the Mason that he should be guarded in all his words and actions, preserving unsullied the Masonic virtues of silence and circumspection which are inculcated in that book.” And he might have added, with advantage to Masters of Lodges, that it is emblematic of the great HOUSEHOLD of Masonry in which the Initiates of the four quarters of the globe have an abiding and immediate interest by the selection of its members, and, therefore, have entrusted every Master of a Lodge with an officer called a Tiler, and armed him with a drawn sword to prevent the ingress of any unworthy member into the Institution of Masonry. OP THE TEMPER AND QUALITIES REQUISITE IN THOSE WHO WOULD BE FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS Before we enter upon the duties of a Free Mason, in the various offices and stations to which he may be called in the Lodge, it is proper to give some account of the temper and qualities which are absolutely requisite, in all who aspire to partake of the sublime honors and advantages belonging to those who are initiated into the mysteries, and instructed in the art of Ancient Masonry. SECTION I. CONCERNING GOD AND RELIGION Whosoever from love of knowledge, interest or curiosity, de - sires to be a Mason, is to know, that as his foundation and great cornerstone, he is to believe firmly in the Eternal God, and to pay that worship which is due to Him as the great Architect and Governor of the Universe. A Mason is also obliged by his tenure to observe the moral law, as a true Noachida;* and iF he rightly Sons of Noals. the first name for Free Maaons L"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"4 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 5 understands the Royal Art, he cannot tread in the irreligious paths of the unhappy libertine, or stupid atheist; nor, in any case, act against the great inward light of his own conscience. He will likewise shun the gross errors of bigotry and supersti - tion; making a due use of his own reason, according to that liberty wherewith a Mason is made free. For although in ancient times the Christian Masons were charged to comply with the usages of the countries where they sojourned or worked (being found in all nations, and of divers religions and persuasions) yet it is now thought only expedient that the brethren in general should only be charged to adhere to the essentials of religion, in which all men agree, leaving each brother to his own private judg - ment as to particular modes and forms. Whence it follows that all Masons are to be good men and true—men of honor and honesty, by whatever religious names or persuasions distinguished; always following that golden precept, of “doing unto all men as (upon a change of conditions) they would that all men should do unto them.” Thus, since Masons, by their tenure, must agree in the three great articles of Noah,* Masonry becomes the centre of union among the brethren, and the happy means of conciliating and cementing into one body those who might otherwise have re - mained at a perpetual distance; thereby strengthening the divine obligations of religion and love SECTION II. CONCERNING GOvERNMENT AND THE civil. MAGISTRATE W’hoever will be a true Mason, is further to know that by the rules of this art, his obligations as a subject and citizen will not be rela,ied, but enforced. He is to be a lover of quiet, peaceable and obedient to the civil powers, which yield him protection, and are set over him where he resides or works, so far as they infringe not the limited bounds of reason and of religion. Nor Brothe,Iy Love. Rallef. and Truth. can a real Craftsman ever be concerned in plots against the State, or be disrespectful to the magistracy; because the welfare of his country is his peculiar care. But if any brother by forgetting for a time the rules of his craft, and listening to evil counsels, should unhappily fall into a contrary conduct, he is not to be countenanced in his crimes of rebellion against the State; but he forfeits all benefits of the Lodge, and his fellows would refuse to associate or converse with him in private while he continues in his crimes; that neither offence nor umbrage may be given to lawful government. But such a person is still considered as a Mason, his character as such being indefeasible; and hopes are to be entertained, that the rules of the Craft may again prevail with him, over every evil counsel and device that may have led him astray. From this quiet and meek temper of true Masons, and their constant desire to adorn the countries where they reside with all useful arts, crafts, and improvements, they have been from the earliest ages, encouraged and protected by the wisest rulers of states and commonwealths; who have likewise thought it an honor to have their names enrolled among the Fraternity. And thus Masonry having always flourished most in the most flourish - ing and peaceable times of every country, and having often suffered in a particular manner through the calamitous effects of war, bloodshed, and devastation, the Craftsmen are, there - fore, the more strongly engaged to act agreeably to the rules of their art, in practicing peace and love, as far as possible, with all men. SECTION III. CONCERNII~G PRI7VAT~ QUALITIES AND DUTIES In regard to himself, whoever would be a Mason should know how to practice all the private virtues. He should avoid all man - ner of intemperance or excess, which might obstruct his per - formance of the laudable duties of his Craft, or lead him into crimes which would reflect dishonor on the Ancient Fraternity."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 7 6 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY He is to be industrious in his profession, and true to the Lord and master he serves. He is to labor justly and not to eat any man’s bread for nought, but to pay truly for his meat and drink. What leisure his labor allows, he is to employ in studying the arts and sciences with a diligent mind, that he may the better perform all his duties (as aforesaid) to his Creator, his country, his neighbor, and himself. For, in a few words, “to walk humbly in the sight of God, to do justice, and love mercy,” are the truly indispensable characteristics of a real Free and Accepted Mason. For the better attainment of these shining qualities he is to seek to acquire, as far as possible, the virtues of patience, meek - ness, self-denial, forbearance, and the like, which give~ him the command over himself, and enable him to govern his own family with affection, dignity, and prudence; at the same time check - ing every disposition injurious to the world, and promoting that love and service which brethren of the same Lodge or household owe to each other. Therefore to afford succor to the distressed, to divide our bread with the industrious poor, and to put the misguided traveler into the way, are qualities inherent in the Craft, and suitable to its dignity. But though a Mason is never to shut his eat unkindly to the complaints of any of the human species, yet when a brother is oppressed or suffers, he is in a more peculiar manner called to open his whole soul in love and compassion to him, and to relieve without prejudice, according to his capacity It is further necessary, that all who would be true Masons, should learn to abstain from malice and slander, evil-speaking, backbiting, unmannerly, scornful, provoking, reproachful and ungodly language; and that he should know how to obey those that are set over him, on account of their superior qualifications as ~‘v1asons however they may be in worldly rank or station. For although Masonry divests no man of his temporal honors or titles, but on the contrary, highly respects them, yet in the Lodge, pre-eminence of virtue and knowledge in the Royal Art, is con- sidered as the true fountain of all nobility, rule and government The last quality and virtue which I shall mention as absolutely requisite in all those who would be Masons, is that of SECRECY, which, indeed from its importance, ought to have held the first place in this chapter, if it had not been intended to treat of it more fully, as a conclusion of the whole. So great stress is laid upon this particular virtue, that it is enforced among Masons under the strongest penalties and ob - ligations, nor, in their esteem, is any man to be counted wise who is void of intellectual strength and ability to cover and con - ceal such honest secrets as are committed to him, as well as his own more serious affairs. Both sacred and profane history teach us, that numerous virtuous attempts have failed of their Intended scope and end through defect of secret concealment. The ancient philosophers and wise men (the princes of whom were Masons) were so fully persuaded of the great virtue of secrecy, that it was the first lesson which they taught their pupils and followers. Thus in the school of Pythagoras we find it was a rule that every novitiate was to be silent for a time, and refrain from speaking, unless when a question was asked, to the end that the valuable secrets which he had to communicate might be the better perserved and valued. Lycurgus made a perpetual law, obliging every man to keep secret whatever was committed to him, unless it were to the injury of the State. And Cato, the Roman Censor, told his friends, that of three things (if ever he happened to be guilty) he always repented—viz: 1st. If he divulged a secret; 2nd. If he went on water when he might stay on dry land; and 3rd. If he suffered a day to pass without doing (or endeavoring to do) some good. We also read that the Persian law punished the betrayal of a secret more grievously than any other common crime. Nor is the virtue of secrecy recommended only by the wisest heathen philosophers and law-givers, but likewise by the fathers of the church and by inspired writers -4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"1 8 CONSTITUTION OP MASONRY St. Ambrose places the patient gift of silence among the prin - cipal foundations of virtue, and the wise King Solomon deems the man unworthy to reign, or have any rule over others, who cannot command himself and keep his own secrets. A discoverer of secrets, he deems infamous and a traitor; but him that conceals them, he accounts a faithful brother. “A tale-bearer,” says he, “revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth them. Discover not a secret to another, lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. He that keepeth his tongue, keepeth his own soul.” To the same purpose in the Book of Ecciesiastes (chap. xxvii.), we meet with the following beautiful passages, worthy to be forever recorded in the hearts of all Masons: “Whosoever dliscovereth seclets, loseth his credit, and shall never find a friend to his mind. Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him; but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him: for as a man hath destroyed his enemy, so hath thou lost the love of thy neighbor. As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hath thou let thy neighbor go, and shall not get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is too far o~; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare. As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling, there may be reconcilement; but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope.” Thus far hath been spoken of the internal qualities and virtues required in all who aspire to the sublime honor and advantage of becoming Free and Accepted Masons. We speak next of the external qualities, and the steps to be pursued, in order to obtain initiation and admission into a duly warranted Lodge of Ancient York Masons. Be it known to you, then, in the first place, that no person is capable of becoming a member of such Lodge, unless, in ad - dition to the qualities and virtues mentioned above, or at least a disposition and capacity to seek and acquire them, he is also “free born, of mature and discreet age; of good report; of suffi- cient natural endowments, and the senses of a man; with an estate, office, trade, occupation, or some visible way 0 f acquiring an honest livelihood, and of working in his Craft, as become the Ti CONSTITUTION OP MASONRY 9 members of this most ancient and honorable Fraternity, who ought not only to earn what is sufficient for themselves and families, but likewise something to spare for works of chaiity and for supporting the ancient grandour and dignity of the Royal Craft. Every person desiring admission, must also be up - right in body, not deformed or dismembered at the time of mak - ing, but of hale and entire limbs, as a man ought to be.” Thus, you see, a strict, though private and impartial inquiry, will be made into your character and ability before you can be admitted into any Lodge; and by the rules of Masonry, no friend who may wish to propose you can show you any favor in this respect. But if you have a friend who is a Mason, and is every way satisfied in these points, his duty is described as follows, viz: SECTION IV. CONCERblING THE PROPOSING O1~ NEW MEMBERS IN A LODGE Every person desirous of being made a Free Mason in any Lodge, shall be proposed by a member thereof, who shall give an account of the candidate’s name, age, quality, title, trade, place of residence, description of his person, and other requisites as mentioned in the foregoing sections. And it is generally re - quired that such proposal be also seconded by some one or more members, who likewise know something of the candidate. Such proposal shall also be made in Lodge hours,* at least one Lodge night before initiation, in order that the brethren may have sufficient time and opportunity to make a strict inquiry into the morals, character, circumstances and connections of the candi - date, for which purpose a special committee is sometimes ap - pointed. The brother who proposes a candidate, shall at the same time deposit such a sum of money for him as the rules or by-laws of the Lodge may require, which is forfeited to the Lodge, if the That is. from Mareh 25th to September 26th, between the hour, of seven and ten: sod from September 25th to Ma.reh 25th, between the hours of six and nine.

In case he is elected, he is to pay (in addition to his deposit) such further sum as the laws of the Lodge may require, and clothe the Lodge, or make some other present, if his circumstances will admit, and the brethren agree to accept the same for the benefit of the Craft, and of distressed members. Having shown that a strict enquiry will be made into your character, justice requires that you should also be advised to be alike circumspect on your side, and to make enquiry into the character of the Lodge into which you desire admission: for there is no excellence without its opposite, and no true coin without counterfeits. In the first place, then, you have a right before admission, to desire your friend to show you the warrant or dispensation by which the Lodge is held; which, if genuine, you will find to be an instrument printed or written upon parchment, and signed by some noble Grand Master, his Deputy and Grand Wardens, and Grand Secretary, sealed with the Grand Lodge seal, con - stituting particular persons (therein named) as Master and Wardens, with full power to congregate and hold a Lodge at such place, and therein “make and admit Free Masons, accord - ing to the most ancient and honorable custom of the Royal Craft, in all ages and nations, throughout the known world; with full power and authority to nominate and choose their successors,” etc. You may request the perusal of the by-laws, which being short, you may read in the presence of your friend or he will read to you, and show you also a list of the members of the Lodge, by all which, you will be the better able to judge whether you would choose to associate with them, and submit to be conform- able to their rules. Being thus free to judge for yourself, you will not be liable to the dangers of deception, nor of having your pockets picked by impost ers, and of perhaps being afterwards laughed at into the bargain; but, on the contrary, you will be admitted into a Society, where you will converse with men of honor and honesty, be exercised in all the offices of brotherly love, and be made acquainted with mysteries of which it is not lawful to speak further, or to reveal out of the Lodge. CHAPTER II. Having in the foregoing chapter treated as briefly as possible “of the temper and qualities required in those who wish to be - come Free and Accepted Masons,” I now proceed (according to our proposed method) to collect and digest, under proper heads, those general regulations (old as well as new), which more im - mediately concern operative Masons, avoiding prolixity, and the Insertion of such old regulations as are explained or supplied by subsequent ones, universally received and now in force in all the Lodges. SECTION I CONCERNING A LODGE AND ITS GOVERNMENT 1. A Lodge ts a place in which Masons meet to work. The assembly or organized body of Masons is also called a Lodge (just as the word church is expressive both of the congregation of people and of the place in which they meet to worship), and ~s officered by a Master, Senior and Junior Warden, Secretary, Treasurer, Senior and Junior Deacon, Steward and Tiler. 2. The qualities of those who are to be admitted as members of a Lodge have been fully mentioned in the foregoing chapter, and it is only necessary to repeat here in general, that they are to be “men of good report, free born, of mature age7~ hale and sound, not deformed or dismembered at the time of their making, and no women or eunuch.” 3. A Lodge ought to assemble for work at least once in each calendar month, and must ~ 0 A 5~5~ of one Master, two Wardens In this country they are not supposed to be mat,,re before they are twenty-one years of age."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"12 COr~STTUTION OP MASONRY CONSTITUTION OP MASONRY 13 —Senior and Junior—one Secretary, one Treasurer, and as many members as the Master and a majority of the Lodge shall, from time to time, think proper, although more than forty or fifty (when they can attend regularly, as the wholesome rules of the Craft require), are generally found inconvenient for woiking to advantage; and, therefore, when a Lodge comes to be thus numerous, some of the ablest master workmen, and others under their direction, will obtain leave to separate and apply to the Grand Lodge for a warrant to work by themselves in order to the further advancement of the Craft, as the laws here - after to be delivered will more particularly show. But such warrant cannot be granted to any number of Masons, nor can a new Lodge be formed unless there be among them three Master Masons, to be nominated and installed officers for governing and instructing the brethren of such Lodge, and promoting them in due time according to their merit. 4. When men of eminent quality, learning, rank or wealth apply to be made and admitted into the Lodge, they are to be accepted with proper respect after due examination, for among such are often found those who afterwards prove good Lords or Founders of work, excellent officers and the ablest designers, to the great honor and strength of the Lodge. From among them also the Fraternity can generally have some honorable or learned Grand Master and other Grand Officers. But still these brethren are equally subject to all the charges and regulations, except in what more immediately concerns operative Masons and their preferment, as well as the preferment of all other Masons and must be governed by the general rule; that is to say, founded upon real worth and personal merit, and not upon mere seniority, or any other particular rank or quality. 5. In order that due decorum may be observed while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn, and for the better preservation of secrecy and good harmony, a brother well skilled in the Master’s part, shall be appointed and paid for tiling the Lodge door during the time of communication. 6. Every Lodge shall keep a book containing their by-laws, the names of their members with a list of all the Lodges under the same Grand Lodge, and united in general communication, with the usual times and places of meeting in such Lodges, and such other necessary parts of their transactions as are proper to be written. 7. No Lodge shall make more than five new brethren at one time, unless by dispensation from the Grand Master, or Deputy in his absence; nor shall any person be made or admitted a member of the Lodge without being proposed one month before (unless in particular cases), that due notice may be given to all the members to make the necessary enquiries into the candi - date’s character and connections, and that there may be such unanimity in the elections, and admission of members as the by-laws require, because unanimity is essential to the being of every Lodge; and, therefore, no member can be imposed on any Lodge, by any power whatever, without their consent; nor would it be proper to admit any brother to work among them who has openly violated the sacred principles of [Vlasonry, until undoubted proof of his reformation has been given, lest the harmony of the Lodge might be thereby disturbed, and not then, till a certificate is produced of his having paid all arrearages to that Lodge of which he was last a member; for should any Lodge admit a brother, who is in arrears to any other Lodge, the Lodge where he is admitted make the debt their own. 8. As every Lodge has a right to keep itself an entire body, they ought never to interfere in the business of another Lodge. Therefore it would be highly improper in any Lodge to confer a degree on a brother who is ‘not of their household; for every Lodge ought to be competent to their own business, and are indubitably the best judges of the qualifications of their own members; and it does not follow as of course, that a brother ad - mitted among the household as an Apprentice, to learn the Royal Art, is capable of taking charge of that household, however"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 15 14 CONSTiTUTION OF MASONRY skilled he may be in his apprenticeship, for there are many very necessary qualifications essential in those who are promoted to the higher orders. 9. As the officers of every Lodge are the proper representatives of their own Lodge in Grand Lodge, still for the sake of equal representation, the officers are allowed deputies, when unable to attend themselves, which deputies must be appointed by the majority of every particular Lodge when duly congregated, and their appointment shall be attested by the Secretary, with the seal of their Lodge. And every Lodge has the privilege of in - structing their Master and Wardens, or their deputies, for their conduct in the Grand Lodge and quarterly communication. 10. Every brother ought to be a member of some Lodge, nor is it proper that any number of brethren should withdraw or separate themselves from the Lodge in which they were made, or were afterwards admitted members, without a sufficient cause, although the right is an inherent one, and can never be restiained by any power whatever; still, such separation would be improper, unless the Lodge becomes too numerous for working; in which case a sufficient number may withdraw with the approbation of their Lodge, in order to form a new one. But before application can be made to the Grand Lodge, they shall pay all dues to their Lodge, and give them notice in writing that they intend to apply to the Grand Lodge for a warrant to form a new one. The Lodge then shall certify to the Grand Lodge the cause of the applica - tion, and at the same time shall recommend the most fitted brethren as Master and Wardens, before they can obtain the warrant. And no set of Masons, without such warrant, shall ever take upon themselves to work together or form a new Lodge. SECTION II. OF THE ANCIENT MANNER OF CON5TITuTfl~G A LODGE A new Lodge, for avoiding many irregularities, should be ~olemnly Constituted by the Grand Master, with his Deputy and Wardens. or in the Grand Master’s absence, the Deputy acts for his Worship, the Senior Grand Warden as Deputy, the Junior Grand Warden as the Senior, and the present Master of a Lodge as the Junior, or if the Deputy is also absent, the Grand Master may depute either of his Grand Wardens, who can ap - point others to act as Grand Wardens pro tern pore. The Lodge being opened, and the Candidates or new Master and Wardens being yet among the Fellow Crafts, the Grand Master shall ask his deputy if he has examined them, and whether he finds the Master well skilled in the noble science and the Royal Art, and duly instructed in our mysteries, &c. The deputy answering in the affirmative, shall (by the Grand Master’s order) take the candidate from amongst his fellows, and present him to the Grand Master, saying: “Most Worshipful Grand Master, the brethren here desire to be formed into a regular Lodge, and I present my worthy Brother A. B. to be installed their Master, whom I know to be of good morals and great skill, true and trusty, and a lovcr of the whole Fraternity, wheresoever dispersed over the face of the earth.” Then the Grand Master, placing the candidate on his left hand and having asked and obtained the unanimous consent of the brethren, shall say (after some other ceremonies and expressions, that cannot be written), “I constitute and form these good brethren into a new regular Lodge, and appoint you, Brother A. B., the Master of it, not doubting of your capacity and care to preserve the cement of the Lodge,” &c. Upon this the Deputy, or some other brother for him, shall rehearse the charge of a Master, and the Grand Master shall ask the candidate, saying: “Do you submit to these charges as •When institutlouB are required, where the distance iB BO great as to render It ins - poesible for the Grand Officers to attend, the Grand Master, or his Deputy, issues a written instrument, under his hand and private seal, to some worthy brother, who hna been properly Installed Master of a Lodge. with full power to eongregate, install, and constitute the petitioners If the Grand Master and Deputy is absent, or (through sickness) rendered incapable of acting, the Grand Wardens and Grand Secretary, jointly, may issue a like power under their hands and seal of the Grand Lodge, provided the Grand Master has first signed a Warrant mr holding such new Lodge: but the Grand Wardens must nersi issue any Masonleal writings under their private seal or seals."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"16 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 17 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY Masters have done in all ages?” and the new Master signifying his cordial submission thereto, the Grand Master shall by certain significant ceremonies and ancient usage, install him and present him with this warrant, the Book of Constitutions, the Lodge book, and the instruments of his office, one after another, and after each of them, the Grand Master, his deputy, or some brother for him, shall rehearse the short and pithy charge, that is suit - able to the thing presented. Next, the members of this new Lodge, bowing altogether to the Grand Master, shall return his worship their thanks (ac - cording to the customs of Masters), and shall immediately do homage to their Master, and (as faithful Craftsmen) signify their promise of subjection and obedience to him, by usual con - gratulations. The Deputy and Grand Wardens, and any other brethren that are not members of this new Lodge, shall next congratulate the new Master; and he shall return his becoming acknowledg - ments, first to the Grand Master and Grand Officers, and to the rest in their order. Then the Grand Master orders the new Master to enter im - mediately upon the exercise of his office, and calling forth his Senior Warden, a Fellow Craft* (Master Mason), presents him to the Grand Master for his worship’s approbation, and to the new Lodge for their consent; upon which the Senior or Junior Grand Warden, or some brother for him, shall rehearse the charge of a Warden, &c., of a private Lodge, and he signifying his cordial submission thereto, the new Master shall present him singly, with the several instruments of his office, and in ancient manners and due form install him in his proper place.t In like manner the new Master shall call forth his Junior Warden, who shall be a Master Mason, and present him (as above) to the Junior Grand Warden, or some other brother in They were called Fellow Crafts, because the Masons of old times never gave any man the title of Master Mason, until he had liret passed the chair. ±The Grand wardens generally install tile Wardens at new Constitutions, as being best qualified for transacting such business.

The Grand Master then gives all the brethren joy of the Master and Wardens, &c., and recommends harmony, &c., hoping their only contention will be a laudable emulation in cultivating the Royal Art, and the social virtues. Then the Grand Secretary or some brother for him (by the Grand Master’s order), in the name of the Grand Lodge, de - clares and proclaims this new Lodge duly constituted No. &c. Upon which all the new Lodge together (after the custom of Masters), return their hearty and sincere thanks for the honor of his constitution. The Grand Master also orders the Grand Secretary to register this new Lodge in the Grand Lodge book, and to notify the same to the other particular Lodges; and after some other ancient customs and demonstrations of joy and satisfaction, he orders the Senior Grand Warden to close the Lodge. SECTION III. CONCRRNING THE BEHAvIOR OF MASONS AS MEMBERS OF A LODGE 1. Of Attendance. Every brother ought to belong to some regular Lodge, and should always appear therein properly clothed, and in clean and decent apparel, truly subjecting himself to all its by-laws and general regulations. He must attend all meetings, whether stated or emergent, when duly summoned unless he can offer to the Master and Wardens such plea of necessity for his absence as the said laws and regulations admit. By the ancient rules and usages of~ Masonry (which are gen - erally adopted among the by-laws of every Lodge), no plea was judged sufficient to excuse any absentee, unless he could satisfy"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"V 18 CONSTITUTION O~ MASONRY the Lodge that he was sick, lame, in confinement, upwards of three miles from the places of meeting, or detained by some ex - traordinary and unforeseen necessity. 2. Of Working. All Masons should work hard and honestly on working days, that they may live reputably, and appear in a decent and be - coming manner on holidays. All the working hours appointed by law, or confirmed by custom, are to be strictly observed under the penalties and fines hereafter to be laid down. The hours of work are ‘from seven o’clock in the evening till ten, between the 25th of March and the 25th day of September, and from six till nine between the 25th of September and the 25th of March.” The Master and Masons shall faithfully finish the Lord’s work, whether task or journey; nor shall they take the work at task, which have been accustomed to journey. None shall envy a brother’s prosperity, nor supplant or put him out of his work, if capable to finish it. All Masons shall meekly receive their wages without murmur - ing or mutiny, nor desert the matter till the Lord’s work is finished. They must avoid all unbecoming modes of expression, calling each other Brother and Fellow, both within and without the Lodge, with much courtesy as beseemeth. They shall instruct the younger brothers to become bright and expert workmen, that the Lord’s materials be not spoiled. But as Free and Ac - cepted Masons, they must not allow cowans to work with them, nor even be themselves employed by cowans, without an urgent necessity. Arid when such necessity happens, they shall have a separate communication, and not suffer cowans to learn from them nor any laborer to be employed in the proper work of Free Musons. 3. Of Behavior in the Lodge while open. r CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 19 private conversation or committees, without leave from the Master; nor talk of anything foreign or impertinent to the work in band; nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any other brother addressing himself to the chair; nor act ludicrously while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn; but every brother shall pay due reverence to the N/laster, the Wardens, and all his Fellows, and put them to worship. Every brother found guilty of a fault, shall stand to the award of the Lodge, unless he appeals to the Grand Lodge; but if the Lord’s work be hindered in the meanwhile, a particular reference may be made. No private piques, or quarrels about nations, families, religions or politics, must be brought within the doors of the Lodge, as being directly contrary to the rules already laid down—Masons being declared of the oldest Catholic~., religion, universally ac - knowledged as such and of all nations, bound to live upon the square, level and plumb with each other, following the steps of their predecessors in cultivating the peace and harmony of the Lodge, without distinction of sect or political party. 4. Of Behavior after the Lodge is closed and before the Brethren depart home. When the Lodge is closed, and the labors of the day, finished, the brethren, before they depart home to their rest, may enjoy themselves with innocent mirth, enlivened and exalted with their own peculiar songs; and sublime pieces of music, treating one another according to ability, but avoiding all excess and com - pulsion, both in eating and drinking; considering each other in the hours both of labor and festivity as always free. And, therefore, no brother is to be hindered from going home when he pleases; for although after Lodge hours, Masons are as other men, yet if they should fall into e~cess, the blame, though un - justly, may be cast upon the Fraternity by the ignorant or envious world. While the Lodge is open for work, Masons must hold no"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"20 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY SECTION IV. CONCERNING THE BEHAVIOR OF MASONS IN THEIR PRIvATE CHARACTER 1. When a number of Brethren happen to meet, without any Strangers among them, and not in a forincil Lodge. In such a case you are to salute each other in a courteous manner, as you are or may be instructed in the Lodge, calling each other brother, and freely communicating hints of knowledge, but without disclosing secrets unless to those who have given long proof of their taciturnity and honor; and taking care in all your actions and conversations, that you are neither overseen or overheard of strangers. In this friendly intercourse, no brother shall derogate from the respect due to another, were he not a Mason. For though all Masons, as brothers, are upon the level, yet Masonry (as was said in a former section) divests no man of the honors due to him before, or that may become due after he was made a Mason. On the contrary, it increases his respect, teaching us to add to all his other honors those which, as Masons, we cheerfully pay to an eminent brother, distinguishing him above all of his rank and station, and serving him readily accord - ing to our ability. 2. When in presence of Strangers who are not Masons. Before those who are not Masons, you must be cautious in your words, carriage, and motions; so that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to discover what is not proper to be intimated. The impertinent and ensnaring questions or ignorant and idle discourse of those who seek to pry into the secrets and mysteries committed to you, must be prudently answered and managed, or the discourse wisely diverted to another subject, as your discretion and duty shall direct. 3. When at Home and in your Neighborhood. K CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 21 cjuired in the foregoing sections and charges. Consequently they should be good husbands, good parents, good sons, and good neighbors, not staying too long from home, avoiding all excess injurious to themselves or families, and wise as to all affairs, both of their own household and of the Lodge, for certain reasons known to themselves. 4. Of behavior towards a Foreign Brother, or Stranger. You are cautiously to examine a stranger or foreign brother, as prudence and the rules of the Craft direct, that you may not be imposed upon by a pretender; and if you discover any one to be such, you are to reject him with scorn a.nd shame, taking care to give him no hints; but such as are found to be true and faithful you are to respect as brothers, according to what is di - rected above; relieving them, if in want, to your utmost power; or directing them how to find relief, and employing them, if you can, or else recommending them to employment. 5. Of Behavior behind a Brother’s back as well as before his face. Free and Accepted Masons have ever been charged to avoid all manner of slandering and backbiting of true and faithful brethren, with all malice and unjust resentment, or talking dis - respectfully of a brother’s person or performance. Nor must they suffer any others to spread unjust reproaches or calumnies against a brother behind his back, nor to injure him in his fortune, occupation or character; but they shall defend such a brother, and give him notice of any danger or injury wherewith he may be threatened, to enable him to escape the same, as far as is con - sistent with honor, prudence, and the safety of religion, morality, and the state, but no further. 6. Concerning Differences and Law Suits, if any should unhappily arise among Brethren. If a brother do you an injury, or if you have any difference with him about any worldly or temporal business or interest, Masons ought to be moral men, and fully qualified as is re -"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"22 CONSTrIUTION OF MASONRY apply first to your own or his Lodge to have the matter in dispute adjusted by the brethren. And if either party be not satisfied with the determination of the Lodge, an appeal may be carried to the Grand Lodge and you are never to enter into a law suit, till the matter cannot be decided as above. And if it be a matter that wholly concerns Masonry, law suits are to be entirely avoided, and the good advice of prudent brethren is to be followed, as they are the best referees of such differences. But where references are either impracticable or unsuccessful, and courts of law or equity must at last decide, you must still follow the general rules of Masonry already laid down, avoiding all wrath, malice, rancor and personal ill-will in carrying on a suit with a brother, neither saying or doing anything to hinder the continuance or renewal of that brotherly love and friendship which are the glory and cement of this Ancient Fraternity. Thus shall we show to all the world the benign influence of Masonry, as wise, true, and faithful brethren before us have done from the beginning of time; and as all who shall follow us and would be thought worthy of that name will do, till architecture shall be dissolved, with the great fabric of the world, in the last general conflagration. These charges, and such others as shall be given to you, in a way that cannot be written, you are strictly and conscientiously to observe; and that they may be the better observed, they should be read or made known to new brethren at their making, and at other times, as the Master shall direct. Amen—So mote it be! SECTION V. OF THE MASTER OF A LODGE, HIS ELECTION, OFFICE, AND DUTY No brother can be Master of a Lodge till he has first served in the office of Warden somewhere, unless in extraordinary cases, or when a new Lodge is to be formed, and no past or former Warden is to be found among the members. In such cases, three Master Masons, although they have served in no former offices F CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 23 (if they be well learned), may be constituted Master and Wardens of such new Lodge, or any Lodge in the like emer - gency. The Master of every Lodge shall be chosen by ballot on the stated Lodge-night each St. John’s day; and the pr~sent Wardens (where they regularly are) shall be put up among the number of candidates for the chair, but shall then withdraw, while every free member (viz’ all who have paid up their fines and dues, or have been excused payment according to law) gives his vote in favor of him whom he deems most worthy. Each free member hath one vote, and the Master two votes, where the number of votes happens to be equal, otherwise he has but one vote. When the ballot is closed, and before it be examined, the former Master shall order the candidates to be brought back before him, and to take their seats again as Wardens. He shall then carefully examine the poll, and audibly declare him that bath the majority of votes, duly elected. The Master-elect shall then nominate one for the Senior Warden’s chair, and the present Master and brethren shall nominate one in Opposition; both of whom shall withdraw till the ballot is closed as aforesaid, after which they shall be called before the Master, and the poll shall be examined and declared by him as above directed; in like manner shall the Lodge pro - ceed in the choice of all the inferior officers, great care being taken that none be put in nomination for favor or affection, birth or fortune, exclusive of the consideration of real merit and ability, to fill his office for the honor and advancement of Masonry. No Mason chosen into any office can refuse to serve without incurring the penalties laid down in the chapter of fines, unless he has served in the same office before. The Master of every regular Lodge, thus duly elected and installed, has it in his special charge (as appurtenant to his office, duty and dignity) to see that the by-laws of his Lodge, as well as the general regu - lations from the Grand Lodge, be duly observed: that his Ward- I"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"24 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY CONSTrruTION OF MASONRY 25 ens discharge their office faithfully, and be examples of diligence and sobriety to the Craft; and true and exact minutes and entries of all proceedings be made and kept by the Secretary; that the Treasurer keep and render exact and just accounts at the stated times, according to the by-laws and orders of the Lodge; and in general, that all the goods and moneys belonging to the body be truly managed and dispensed, as if they were those of his own private household, according to the vote and direction of the majority, whether in charity or in working; and that no more wages than are just be given to any Fellow or Apprentice. The Master shall further take care that no Apprentice or Fellow be taken into his house or Lodge, unless he has sufficient employment for him, and finds him to be the son of honest parents, a perfect youth, without maim or defect in body, of full age,~ and otherwise duly qualified (according to the rules before laid down) for learning and understanding the sublime mysteries of the Art. Thus shall the Lords or Founders be well served, and the Craft not despised. Thus also shall such Ap - prentices when expert in the business of their apprenticeship, be admitted, upon further improvement, as Fellow Crafts; and in due time, be raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason, capable themselves to undertake the Lord’s work; animated with the prospect of passing in future through all the higher honors of Masonry, viz: those of Wardens and Masters of their Lodges, and perhaps, at length, of Grand Wardens and Grand Masters of all the Lodges, according to their merit. The Master of a particular Lodge has the right and authority of calling his Lodge, or congregating the members into a Chap - ter at pleasure, upon the application of any of the brethren, and upon any emergency and occurrence, which in his judgment may require their meeting; and he is to fill the chair when present. It is likewise his duty, together with his Wardens, to attend the Grand Lodge at the quarterly communications, and See note. page ii. also the Steward’s Lodge, and such occasional or special Grand Communications as the good of the Craft may require, when duly summoned by the Grand Secretary, and within such reason - able distance of the place of holding the Grand Lodge as the laws of the same may have ascertained on that head. When in the Grand or Steward’s Lodge, and at General as well as Special Communications, the Master and Wardens, or either of them, have full power and authority to represent their Lodge, and to transact all matters relative thereto, as well and as truly as if the whole body were there present. The Master has the right of appointing some brother (who is most commonly the Secietary of the Lodge) to keep the book of by-laws and other laws given to the Lodge by the proper authority; and in this book shall also be kept the names of all the members of the Lodge, and a list of all the Lodges within the said Grand Communication, with the usual times and places of their meeting. The Master has also the particular right of preventing the removal of his Lodge from one house to another; and whereas several disputes have arisen on this head, and it hath been made a question in whom the power of removing a Lodge to any new place is invested, when the old place of meeting appears to be inconvenient, the following rule for this purpose hath been finally agreed upon and settled by lawful authority, viz: “That no Lodge be removed without the Master’s knowledge~ nor any motion made for that purpose in the Lodge when he is. absent. But if the Master be present, and a motion be made for moving the Lodge to some other more convenient place (within the district assigned in the warrant of such Lodge), and if the said motion be seconded and thirded, the Master shall order summonses to every individual member of the Lodge, specifying the business and appointing a day for hearing andi determining the affair, at least ten days before, and the determi - nation shall be made by the majority. But if the Master is not - of the majority, the Lodge shall not be removed, unless full two-thirds of the members present have voted for such removal."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"GONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 27 26 CONSTITUTION OF IvIASONRY “But if the Master refuse to direct such summons to be issued (upon a motion duly made as aforesaid), then either of the Wardens may direct the same; and if the Master neglects to attend on the same day fixed, the Warden may preside in de - termining the affair in the manner above prescribed. But the Lodge shall not, in the Master’s absence (on such special call), enter upon any other cause or business but what is particularly mentioned in the said summons. “If the Lodge is thus regularly ordered to be removed the Master or Warden shall send notice to the Grand Secretary that such removal may be notified and duly entered in the Grand Lodge books at the next Grand Lodge. “N. B. It is also a good method to have a certificate from the Grand Lodge that such removal hath been allowed, confirmed and duly registered in their books; which will be a business of course, unless an appeal be lodged against such removal by the minority, and then a hearing will be given to both parties in the Grand Lodge, before such removal be confirmed or regis - tered in their books.” The Master’s duty in making and admitting new brethren, and some other particular duties of his office, being such as cannot be written, save on the tablet of his heart, are, therefore, not to be looked for in this place, and, moreover, such duties as more particularly belong to the Master and other officers of Lodges, when they sit as members of the Grand Lodge, are to be learned from the chapter which treats of the Grand Lodge. SECTION VI. OF THE WARDENS O1~ A LODGE 1. None but Master Masons can be Wardens of a Lodge. The manner of their election~ and several of their duties, being connected with the election and duties of the Master, have been rnentioned in the former section. 2. The Senior Warden succeeds to all the duties of the Mas - ter, and fills the chair when he is absent. Or if the Master goes abroad on business, resigns, dimits or is deposed, the Senior Warden shall forthwith fill his place till the next stated time of election. And although it was formerly held, that in such cases the Master’s authority ought to revert to the last Past Master who is present, yet it is now the settled rule that the authority devolves upon the Senior Warden, and in his absence upon the Junior Warden, even although a former Master be present. But the Wardens will generally waive this privilege in honor of any Past Master that may be present, and will call on him to take the chair~ upon the presumption of his experience and skill in conducting the business of the Lodge. Nevertheless~ such Past Master still derives his authority under the Senior Warden, and cannot act till he congregates the Lodge. If none of the officers be present~ nor any former Master, to take the chair, the mem - bers according to seniority and merit, shall fill the places of the absent officers. The business of the Wardens in the Lodge, is generally, to assist the Master in conducting the business theieof, and manag - ing the Craft, in due order and form, when the Master is present. and in doing his duties (as above set forth) when he is necessarily absent; all which is to be learned from the foregoing section. Particular Lodges do likewise by their by-laws assign particular duties to their Wardens for their own better government; which such Lodges have a right to do—provided they transgress not the old landmarks~ nor in any degree violate the true genius and~ spirit of Masonry. SECTION VII. OF THE SECRETARY OF A LODGE The Secretary shall keep a regular register or record of all transactions and proceedings of the Lodge that are fit to be com - mitted to writing, which shall be faithfully enteted in the Lodge books, from the minutes taken in open Lodge, after being duly"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"28 CONSTITUTION OF MA5ONRY CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 29 read, amended (if necessary) and approved of before the close of every meeting, in order that the said transaction, or authentic copies thereof, may be ready to be laid before the Grand Lodge once in every quarter if required. In particular, the Secretary shall keep exact lists of all the members of the Lodge, with the times of admission of new mem - bers; and upon or near every St. John’s day, shall prepare and send to the Secretary of the Grand Lodge the list of members for the time being, which shall be signed not only by the newly installed officers of each Lodge, but also by the last past officers; to the intent that the Grand Secretary, and consequently the members of the Grand Lodge, may be at all times enabled to know the names and number of members in each Lodge under their jurisdiction, with the handwriting of the different officers, and to pay all due respect to the brethren recommended or certified by them from time to time. SECTION VIII. OF THE TREASURER O1~ A LODGE The treasurer is to receive and keep exact accounts of all moneys raised or paid in, according to the rule of the advance - ment of the Lodge and benefit of the brethren, and to pay all orders duly drawn upon him by the authority of the Lodge. He is to keep regular entries, both of his receipts and disbursements, and to have his books and vouchers always ready for examina - tion at such stated times as the by-laws require, or when specially called upon by order of the Master and brethren. The treasurer is likewise to have the charge and custody of the’. chest, jewels and furniture of the Lodge, unless when the Master and majority may judge it more convenient to appoint some other responsible brother for that particular duty, or when the officers of the Lodge may take the charge immediately upon themselves. The warrant in particular is in the charge and custody of the Master. SECTION IX. OE THB DEACONS O1~ A LODGE To the Senior and Junior Deacons, with such assistance as may be necessary, is entrusted the examination of visitors. It is their province also to attend on the Master and Wardens and to act as their proxies in the active duties of the Lodge, such as the reception of candidates into the different degrees of Masonry, and in the immediate practice of our rites. SECTION X. OF THE TILER OF A LODGE The Tiler shall be a Iviaster Mason, of knowledge and ex - perience, and generally a brother is to be preferred to whom the fees of the office may be necessary and serviceable~ on account of his particular circumstances. His duty is fixed by custom, and known to every biother; and his chief charge is, not to admit any person (not even a member~ while the Lodge is sitting) without the knowledge and consent of the presiding officer; neither shall he admit any visitor (that is not a member of a warranted Lodge) a second time, sojourners producing certificates excepted. CHAPTER HI. SECTION 1. OF A GRAND LODGE 1. A Grand Lodge consists of the Masters and Wardens of all the regular Lodges in its jurisdiction~ who, when duly as - sembled~ have the inherent power to elect the Grand Officers, which are a Grand Mastery Deputy Grand Master, Grand Senior Warden, Grand Junior Warden~ Grand Secretary, Grand Treas - urer, Grand Senior Deacon, Grand Junior Deacon, Grand Pur - suiVant and Grand Tiler"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"30 CONSTiTUTION OF MASONRY 2. The Present Grand Officers, and all Past Giand Masters, and Past Grand Wardens and Past Masters of Regular Lodges under the same grand jurisdiction, are members of the Grand Lodge; and to constitute a quorum for business it is necessary there should be the representatives of five Regular Lodges. 3. The Grand Lodge thus organized should meet at least once a year, and this meeting to be considered and denominated the Grand Annual Communication, or Convention of Deputies from each Lodge within its jurisdiction. The Grand Communi - cation thus convened shall have a right at all times, and possess an inherent power and authority to make local ordinances and new regulations, as well as to amend old ones, for their own particular benefit, and the good of Masonry in general: provided always, that the ancient landmarks be carefully preserved, and that such regulations be first duly proposed in writing, for the consideration of all the members, and be finally regularly en - acted by the consent of the majority. This has never been dis - puted, for the members of every Grand Lodge are the repre - sentatives of all the Fraternity in Communications, and are an absolute and independent body, with legislative authority: pro - vided, as before observed, that the Grand Masonic Constitution be preserved inviolate; nor any of the landmarks removed. And at this Grand Lodge the different Lodges by their officers or deputies, shall attend with or without notice. 4. No brother whatever can be admitted into the Grand Lodge, unless he is a member of some regular Lodge; nor does the appointment of a brother to an office in the Grand Lodge prevent his holding an office in the private Lodge whereof he is a member. 5. A brother of the rank of Master, having business, or whose attendance may be necessary in point of evidence or intelligence, or a brother of eminence, upon motion, or leave asked and ob - tained, may be admitted into the Grand Lodge; but such brother, being admitted, shall not be allowed to vote, nor have a right to speak to any question or matter in debate, without leave, or CONSTITUTiON OF MASONRY 31 unless desired to give his opinion, and then he is to confine himself to matters that concern Masonry only. 6. No Master or Warden of private Lodges, or other mem - bers of the Grand Lodge, shall ever attend the same, without the jewels xvhich he ought to wear in his own private Lodge, except for some good and sufficient reason to be allowed of in the Grand Lodge. And when any officer of a private Lodge, from such urgent business as may necessarily plead his excuse cannot personally attend the Grand Lodge, his own Lodge may nominate and appoint any one of theii members (being a Mas - ter Mason), with his jewels and clothing, to supply his place, and support the honor of his Lodge in the Grand Lodge: provided such deputy has a certificate of his appointment, with the seal of the Lodge, and attested by the Secretary. SECTION II. IN CASE OF THE ABSENCE OF ANY OF THE GRAND OFFICERS 1. If the Grand Master is absent at any meeting of the Grand Lodge. either stated or occasional, the Deputy Grand Master is to supply his place; if the Deputy Grand Master be likewise absent, the Grand Senior Warden takes the chair; and in his absence, the Grand Junior Warden: and although by old regu - lations, the Master or Past iVlaster of any private Lodge, who has been longest a Mason, had the preference of the chair in the absence of the Grand officers, yet now the rule is, that the Master of the senior private Lodge who may be present, is to take the chair. Nevertheless, any of them may waive the privi - lege, to do honor to a Past Grand Officer, or any eminent brother and Past Master. In all cases, the brother filling the chair may nominate his deputy, and call on any eminent brethren to ii]] the vacancies of the Grand Lodge pro tern. 2. The Grand Master at all times, when he finds he must necessarily be absent from any Lodge, still has the privilege of giving a special commission, under his hand and seal of office,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"32 CONSTITUTION OF rVIASONRY to any eminent brother, being a member of the Grand Lodge, to supply his place, if the Deputy Grand Master should not attend, or be necessarily absent. 3. in case of the death of a Grand Master, or any other Grand Officer, the same order of succession and precedency shall take place, as is above set forth, till the next election; when they shall be regularly chosen, and duly installed. SECTION III. OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS I. The business of the Grand Lodge at their stated Annual Communications is seriously to discourse of, and sedately to consider, transact and settle all matters that concern the pros - perity of the Craft, and the Fraternity in general, or private Lodges, and single brothers in particular. Here, therefore, are all differences to be seriously considered and decided, that can - not be made up and accommodated privately nor by particular Lodges. And ~f any brother thinl~s himself aggrieved by the decision of any private Lodge, he may, by lodging an appeal in writing with the Grand Secretary (who shall summon the parties and their witnesses to appear at the next ensuing Grand Com - munication), have the matter reheard, and finally determined upon; and the Grand Lodge may adjourn from day to day, until the business is finished And the Grand Master, or presiding officer, when the Lodge is regularly opened, shall communicate to the Lodge the nature of whatever business is to come before them; and for the sake of admitting witnesses, it is esteemed most proper to try all matters of controversy in a committee of the Lodge; and in order thereto, the presiding officer shall direct a committee of the whole Lodge to meet in the Lodge room on the succeeding day for the aforesaid purposes; who shall examine and determine upon all and every kind of business that may be referred to them, and make a report of their proceedings to the Grand Lodge on the same evening, for their ratification. cONSTITUTION OF MA5ONi~y 33 2. In hearing all complaints and punishing delinquents, ac - cording to the laws of the Craft, they are instructed to adhere most religiously to the old Hebrew regulation, viz: “If a complaint be made against a brother by another brother, and he be found guilty, he shall stand to the determination of the Lodge; but if the accuser or complainant cannot support his charge, and it should appear to the Lodge to be groundless, being the result of hatred, malice, or some unwarrantable passion, he shall incur such penalty as the accused would have done, had he been duly con - victed.” 3. All matters of controversy before the Grand Lodge shall be determined by a majority of votes; that is to say, the Grand lVlaster or presiding officer having one vote (unless in case of an equal division, and then two), the Deputy Grand Master one vote; the other Grand Officers for the time being, collectively, one vote, the Past Grand Officers and Past Masters, collectively, one vote; and the officers, or their deputies, of each particular Lodge, collectively, one vote. 4. The Grand Master, or presiding officer, shall for the sake of conveniency in voting, direct every collective body to sit to - gether, that when a question is before the Lodge, they may con - sult among themselves how the vote shall be given, and when the question is put, either by holding trp of hands, or otherwise, one of those collective bodies shall vote for the whole, and that duty should fall on the senior Mason SECTION IV. OF PARTICULAR REGULA~ONS 1. The election of the officers of the Grand Lodge shall be annual. The Grand Master shall be elected by a majority of ballots, who shall have the privilege of appointing his deputy. The other Grand Officers shall also be elected by a majority of ballots agreeably to the manner of voting laid down in the suc -"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 35 34 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY ceeding section; all of which elections shall be for one year, and until a new election shall take place. 2. Whenever application is made to the Grand Lodge, by a sufficient number of brethren, for a Charter to form a new Lodge, the Grand Lodge shall not grant the Charter, unless the skill of the petitioners as Masons, and their good conduct as men, will justify it. Great regard should always be had to the morals of such brethren as are entrusted with the important charge; there - fore it is highly essential, when the petitioners are not sufficiently known to the members of the Grand Lodge, that a certificate of their Masonic and Moral character, from two or more eminent brethren, showing them to be Master Masons regularly made, should accompany the petition; this being done, the Grand Lodge shall then issue a Charter authorizing the petitioners, with such other brethren as they may call to their assistance, to enter Apprentices, pass Fellow Crafts, and raise Master Masons, agree - ably to the ancient customs. 3. When a Lodge becomes too numerous for working together, and application is made by some of the members for leave to separate, and form a new Lodge, the cause of their separation should be certified by their Lodge, to the annual stated Grand Communication, at the same time recommending the most proper and fitting brethren as officers of the new Lodge, before a Charter shall issue. 4. The Grand Master, or in his absence out of the state, his Deputy, or either of the intermediate Grand Officers, may grant a dispensation for forming a new Lodge, to continue in force until the next stated Grand Communication, provided the pe - titioners comply with the requisition in the preceding article; which dispensation shall have the seal of the Grand Lodge, attested by the Grand Secretary, and entered by him in the book of proceedings—the fee for which shall be to the Grand Secretary. Still it shall rest with the Grand Lodge at their next Grand Communication, whether a Charter shall issue. 5. Whenever a Charter shall issue from the Grand Lodge, which can be done at no other time than in Grand Communica - tion, they shall direct a dispensation to issue, signed by the presiding officer, with the seal of the Grand Lodge, and attested by the Grand Secretary, directed to some Past Master, with powers to appoint his Wardens, to install the officers of the new Lodge, and set them to work agreeably to ancient customs and usages; but the Master of this new Lodge shall receive his degree in the presence of three Past Masters at least—all of which must be done before that Lodge can be entitled to a representation in the Grand Lodge. 6. Every Charter issued from the Grand Lodge, shall be signed by the Grand Master for the time being, or in case of his death or absence out of the state, by the Deputy Grand Mas - ter and Wardens, sealed with the seal of the Grand Lodge, and attested by the Grand Secretary, directed to three reputable brethren, authorizing them to call in other brethren to their as - sistance, and to enter Apprentices, pass Fellow Crafts, and raise Master Masons, agreeably to ancient customs and usages; the fee for which shall be for the purpose of Grand Charity and other contingencies; and — to the Grand Secretary for providing parchment and affixing the seal, to be paid previous to the delivery of the Charter. 7. The members of the Grand Lodge, and of all Warranted Lodges within their jurisdiction, so far as they have abilities and numbers, have an undoubted right to exercise all degrees of the Ancient Craft, and consequently the Royal Arch; but no Masons of any denomination can hold any Lodge, without warrant for the place where held. Nevertheless, Royal Arch Masons must not at processions, nor in any other place, except in the Royal Arch Lodge, be distinguished by any garment or badge, different from what belongs to them as officers or members of the Grand, or their own private Lodges. 8. That each person admitted to any degree of Masonry in.

Each Lodge on record, shall annually on the stated Grand Communication, pay to the Grand Treasurer for the time being, as a support to the Grand Lodge, the sum of ; or a sum of money equal to , for each and every member be - longing to such Lodge. 10. The several Lodges on record shall transmit to the Grand Lodge annually, a list of all the officers and members composing each Lodge, distinguishing their rank and degree; together with such other matters relating to the Craft in general, as may be deemed proper to communicate; and that the said list be recorded by the Grand Secretary in a book to be set apart for that purpose; to the end that the Grand Lodge may at all times know the number of laborers engaged in this great work. 11. Every brother requiring a Grand Lodge certificate or diploma, which is impressed on parchment, and signed by the proper officers, and signed also opposite the seal by the member himself, shall pay to the Treasurer the sum of ,towards the Grand Charity Fund. Nor is any brother to be entitled to such certificate without a previous certificate from the Lodge, of which he is a member, setting forth his regular behavior, and that he has discharged regularly all Lodge dues. CHAPTER IV. OF THE ELECTrON, OFFICE, AND DUTY OF THE GIIAI~JD OF1~ICERS The election of Grand Officers shall be at the Stated Commu - nication annually, and shall be the first business that comes properly before the Grand Lodge, after receiving the reports of the subordinate Lodges represented. And the Grand Lodge being opened in ample form, the Most Worshipful Grand Master shall direct the Grand Lodge to proceed to the choice of Grand Officers for the ensuing year. SECTION I. OF THE ELECTION OF THE GRAND MASTER The Most Worshipful Grand Master in the chair, shall call on the Grand Lodge to nominate some eminent and skilful brother or brethren for the office of Grand Master. Should there be but one in the nomination, it shall be the indispensible duty of the Most Worshipful to nominate one other in the opposition; but ]f the present Grand Master is again eligible, and is then in the chair, and willing to serve another year, he shall direct his Deputy to nominate the one in opposition. The Grand Mas - ter shall, if eligible, be at all times in the nomination. The members shall then be directed to prepare their ballots for one of the brethren in the nomination, and when done, shall be collected by one of the Grand Deacons. The Worshipful Grand Master shall then call on two of the members to examine the ballots, and deliver to him in writing, the number of votes each candidate shall have; when the Worshipful Grand Master shall cause the brother having the greatest number of votes, to be thrice proclaimed aloud by the Grand Secretary, GRAND MASTER OF MASONS! The Most Worshipful shall then cause the Grand Master-elect to be conducted to the chair, and after introducing him to the members as a brother skilled in the Royal Art, and a lover of the Craft, he shall be clothed with the badges of the office, and installed in due form. All the members shall then salute him according to the ancient and laudable customs of EVlasonry. SEGTION II. OF THE ELECTION OR APPOINTMENT OF THE DEPUTY GRAND MASTER The Grand Master-elect shall then nominate and appoint the Deputy Grand Master as being his inherent right; because as the Grand Master is generally a brother of the first eminence and abilities and long experience, and cannot be supposed to"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 39 38 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY give his attendance on every emergency, it bath always been adjudged needful, not only to allow him a Deputy, but that such Deputy should be a person in whom he can perfectly confide, and with whom he can have full harmony—for which reason it is proper that the Grand Master should have the nomination of his Deputy. Although cases may arise when the Grand Lodge may exercise the right of rejecting the Grand Master s nomina - tion, and of choosing for themselves, of which case (although they seldom happen) the majority of the Lodge can only be judges. The Deputy Grand Master, being thus chosen, or appointed as above, he shall be introduced, installed, congratulated. and saluted in due form as before. SECTION III OF THE ELECTION OF GRAND SENIOR WARDEN The Grand Master elect, shall then nominate some skilful brother as Grand Senior Warden, and the Grand Lodge have the inalienable right of nominating one or more in opposition; (for an opposition is essentially necessary in the choice of all the officers), and the person having the greatest majority of votes, or ballots (still preserving due harmony), is declared, as before, duly elected. The Grand Senior Warden, being thus elected, he shall be introduced, installed, and saluted in due form as before. SECTION IV. OF THE ELECTION OF THE GRAND JUNIOR WARDEN The election of the Grand Junior Warden is precisely in the same manner as the Grand Senior Warden; but sometimes, for the sake of dispatch, both the Grand Wardens are elected to - gether in balloting, by writing Senior opposite the name of one of the candidates, and Junior opposite the name of another. SECTION V. OF THE APPOINTMENT AND OFFICE OF GRAND SECRETARY The office of Grand Secretary bath always been of very great importance in the Grand Lodge, from the multiplicity of matters committed to his care, and from the abilities and learning req - uisite in the management of them. All the transactions of the Grand Lodge are to be drawn into form, and duly recorded by him. All petitions, applications and appeals, are to pass through his hands. No warrant, certificate or instrument of writing from the Grand Lodge, is authentic, without his attestation or signa - ture, and his affixing the Grand Seal as the laws require. The general correspondence with Lodges and byethren over the whole world is to be managed by him agreeably to the voice of the Grand Lodge, and directions of the Grand Master or his Deputy; and he must, therefore, be ready to attend with his Assistant or Clerk, and the books of his Grand Lodge, in order to give all necessary information concerning the general state of matters, and what is proper to be done upon an emergency. For this reason, at every annual election of Grand Officers, the nomination or appointment of the Grand Secretary is con - sidered as the inherent right of the Grand Master, being properly his amanuensis, and an officer as necessary to him as his Deputy. It is, therefore, held under the old regulations, which yet stand unrepealed, that if the Grand Lodge should disapprove either of the Deputy Grand Master or Grand Secretary, they cannot disannuel their appointment, without choosing a new Grand Master, by which all his appointments are rendered void. But this is a case which bath but very seldom happened, and which all true Masons hope there never will be any occasion to make a provision against. The Grand Secretary, by virtue of his office, is a member of the Grand Lodge, and bath a right to vote in common with the Grand Wardens in everything, except in choosing Grand Officers; he also bath the right of appointing his own Deputy, or Assistant"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"40 CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 41 CONSTITUTION O1~ MASONRY Grand Secretary or Clerk but such Deputy or Clerk must be a Master Mason, yet shall not by virtue of that appointment be a member of the Grand Lodge, nor speak without being allowed ot asked, unless he bath otherwise a right, by being either a Past Grand Officer, or Past Master, or Deputy of some regular private Lodge within the jurisdiction. SEGTION VI. OF THE ELECTION AND OE1~ICE OF GRAND ThEASUHER The Grand Treasurer is elected by the body of the Grand Lodge in the same manner as the Grand Wardens, he being considered as an officer peculiarly responsible to all the members in due form assembled, as having the charge of their common stock and property. For to him is committed the care of all money raised for the General Charity and other uses of the Grand Lodge; an account o[ which, he is tegularly to enter into a book, with the respective ends and uses for which the several sums are intended. He is likewise to pay out ~r disburse the same upon such orders, signed, as the rules of the Grand Lodge in this respect shall allow valid. The Grand Treasurer, by virtue of his office, is a member of the Grand Lodge, and hath power to move the same in any matter that concerns his office, and may vote in common with the Grand Wardens; he hath a right to appoint an Assistant or Clerk, who muse be a Master Mason, but shall have no vote, nor be a member oF the Grand Lodge, nor allowed to speak with - out permission, unless oiherwise entitled to a seat, as having been a Past Officer of the Grand Lodge, or Past Master or Deputy of some regular plivate Lodge within the jurisdiction. The Grand Treasuier, or his Assistant, shall always be present in the Grand Lodge, and ready ~o attend the Grand Master and other Giand Officers with his books for inspection when required; and likewise any Grand Committee that may be appointed for cKarnining and adjusting the accounts. SECTION Vii. QE THE GRAND DEACONS The Grand Deacons, whose duty is well known ~n the Grand Lodge, as particular Assistants to the Giand Master and Wardens, in conducting the business of the Grand Lodge, are always mem - bers of the same, so long as they continue in their office, and are most commonly elected by the Grand Lodge as other Grand Officers, though the appointment of right belongs to the Grand Master and Grand Senior Warden, and may be appointed an - nually, or on every Grand Lodge night. SECTION VIII. O1~ THE GRAND TILER AND GRAND PURSUIVANT These officers must be N’laster 1\\’Jasons, but none of them are members oF the Grand Lodge, nor allowed to speak to any matter before the Grand Lodge, without permission. The Grand Tiler’s duty is to look after the door on the out - ward side, to see that none but members enter in; and not even them, if the Grand Lodge is opened, without first informing the Grand Master (through the channel of the Grand Pursuivant) of their being at the door, and wishing to enter. The Grand Tiler is also to summon the members on any special occasion or emergency, by order of the Grand Master or his Deputy, signi - fied to him under the hand of the Grand Secretary or his Clerk. The business of the Grand Pursuivant is to stand at the in - ward door of the Grand Lodge, and to report the names and Litles of all that want admission, as reported to him by the Grand Tiler. He is also to go upon messages while the Grand Lodge is open, and perform sundry other services known oniy in the Grand Lodge. SECTION IX. RULES TO BE OBSERVED DURING THE TIME O! PUBLIC BUSINESS 1. At the third stroke of the Master’s gavel, there shall be a"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"42 CONSTiTUTION OF MASONRY CONSTITUTION OF MASONRY 43 general silence, and he who breaks silence without leave from the chair, shall be publicly reprimanded. 2. Under the same penalty, every brother shall keep his seat ~nd be perfectly silent whenever the Most Worshipful, his Deputy, or Warden shall think proper to call to order. 3. In the Grand Lodge every member shall take his seat ac - cording to the number of his Lodge, and not move about from place to place during the Communication, except the Grand Wardens, as having more immediately the care of the Grand Lodge, and such other officers whose immediate business may call them to different parts of the Lodge room. 4. No brother is to speak more than twice on the same subject, unless to explain himself, or when called upon by the Chair to speak. 5. Every one who speaks shall rise and keep standing, ad - dressing himself in a proper manner to the Chair; nor shall any one presume to interrupt him under the aforesaid penalty, un - less he is wandering from the point, and the Grand Master shall think proper to reduce him to order, and then the said speaker shall sit down. But after he has been set right, he may again proceed if he pleases. 6. If any members be twice called to order at any one Grand Lodge, for transgressing these rules, and is guilty of a third offense of the same nature, the Chair shall peremptorily order him to quit the Grand Lodge room for that night. 7. Whoever shall be so rude as to hiss or laugh at any brother or what he may have advanced, shall be forthwith solemnly ex - cluded the Communication, and declared incapable of ever being a member of the Grand Lodge in future, until another time he publicly owns his fault, and grace be granted. 8. No motion for a new regulation, or for the alteration of an old one, shall be made until it be first handed up in writing to the Chair; and after it has been perused by the Grand Master, the thing may be moved publicly; and then audibly read by the Grand Secretary; and, if it is then seconded and thirded, it must immediately be submitted to the consideration of the whole Assembly, that the sense of the Lodge may be fully heard upon it; after which the question shall be put, pro or con. 9. In order to preserve harmony, it was thought necessary to use counters and a balloting-box when occasion requires; at other times by holding up of hands, or by putting the question aye or no. CHAPTER V. REGULATIONS FOR CHARITY TO BE OBSERVED IN THE GRAND LODGE 1. The Committee on Charity, commonly called the Grand Charity Committee, consists of five Past Masters appointed by the Grand Master at each Annual Communication, and such other members as the Grand Lodge may on the day of annual election appoint; and three of whom, for the sake of expedition, shall be a quorum, whose business shall be to meet at least four stated times in the year, viz: April 1st, July 1st, October 1st, and January 1st (except those days happen on a Sunday, in which case the next day), and as often at other times as may be deemed necessary to hear all petitions, etc., and to order such relief to distressed brethren, as their case may require, and prudence may direct. 2. None but registered Masons who have themselves con - tributed to the Grand charity fund, and were members of a Warranted Lodge during that time, can be considered and re - lieved. Sojourners and traveling Masons, if duly certified and recommended, are to be relieved by private contributions, made for them on the occasion or out of the general fund, as the ma - jority shall think proper. 3. It is the inherent right of this Committee to dispose of the Grand Charity under the aforesaid restrictions, and to such as appear really necessitous and deserving, either by monthly sup - port or otherwise, as to them shall seem meet; provided always, that no brother made in a clandestine manner, nor any brother who has ever assisted in any clandestine making, can ever be qualified to receive any assistance out of the said fund."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"44 CONSTiTUTION OF MASONRY 4. All the transactions of this Committee on Charity are to be regularly entered of record, and audibly read by the Chairman before all the members of the Grand Lodge, at their Annual Grand Communication. CHAPTER VI. OF GRAND VISITATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS All the different Lodges in the same General Communication should, as much as possible, observe the same rules and usages. “Solomon, my son, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments, and remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set.” And to this end it shall be the duty of the Grand Master, or in his absence the presiding officer, on the Grand Lodge of annual election, to appoint some of the Grand Officers, or other skilful Past Grand Officers or Past Masters, to visit all the Lodges within the Communication, and see that the ancient customs and usages are strictly observed. And as this laudable duty has become impracticable, from the extent of their jurisdiction and large number of Lodges, for the brethren before mentioned, to perform the whole of this duty collectively, the Grand Master shall cause the Lodges to be laid off in convenient districts, and allow one or more visitors to each district, with such other as - sistants as may be thought proper, who shall make faithful report of their proceedings to the Grand Communication annually, according to the instructions given them. The brethren so appointed, shall have a dispensation signed by the Grand Master or his Deputy, and attested by the Grand Secretary, with the seal of the Grand Lodge, explaining the nature of their business, whose duty then shall be to visit every Lodge of his district at one of their stated meetings—previously notifying to the Lodge the intended time of visiting them.

Kilwinning Port Royal Crosse, Blandford, Williamsburg, and Cabin Point Royal Arch, and thence by adjournment to the 13th instant when taking the subject of the meeting into consideration, are unanimously of opinion that a Grand Master is requisite in this State, for the following reasons, fouiided en the principles of necessity, convenience and right. viz., First. We find that the Lodges :n this State hold their Charters under five distinct and separate authorities, viz., the Grand Masters of England, Scotland, Ireland, Pennsylvania and America (the last at second hand): of course all have an equal right so appoint their Deputies, who can claim no authority over those not holding this principle. Therefore, any difference ansing between Lodges holding differently cannot be settled for want of a common tribunal. For the same reason the Craft can never meet irs Annual Communication, manifesting that brotherly love and aft cotton, the distinguish - ing characteristic of Masonry from the beginning. Such divided and sub - divid’sd authority can never he producirve to the real good of the Craft. Secondly We cannot discover, upon strict enquiry, that Masonry has ever derived any benefit from the foreign appointment of a Grand Master in this country, thex’ being as little known and as little acknowledged. Thirdly. Being at this time without a Supreme, and so circumstanced as to render it impossible to base recourse to the Grand Lodge beyond the sea should any abuses creep into the Lodges or should any body of the brotherhood be desirous of forming a new Lodge, there is no settled authority to apply to In this case we are of opinion that a Grand Lodge is a matter of necessity. Fourthly and Lastly We find upon record that the Grand Lodges of Eng - land, Scotland and Ireland founded their original right of election upon their sole authority, by motual consent, distinct and separate from all foreign power whatever. We, therefore, conclude that we have, and ought to hold, The first meeting is recorded as being held 6th of May—rhe dates ~‘5th and 7th~~ appear to be in error in copying the same rights and privileges that Masons in all times heretofore have con - fessedly enjoyed. We, the Deputies aforesaid, for ourselves and our respective Lodges, humbly beseech and desire that you will be pleased to take the foregoing reasons into consideration, and that you will favor us with your attendance, by deputation, in this Lodge, for the purpose of electing a Grand Master for this State, on the 23d June next, at 10 o’clock A.

To conduct this ceremony with propriety, de - corum, and solemnity, ought to be the study of every Mason, but more especially those who are called to officiate as officers of the Lodge; to those of our brethren who are thus honored, every eye is naturally directed for propriety of conduct and behavior, and from them our brethren who are less informed will expect an example worthy of imitation. From a share in this ceremony no Mason present can be exempted; it is a general concern in which all must assist; the first notice of which is given by the Worshipful Master, with a request of the atten - tion and assistance of his brethren. No sooner has it been signified than every officer repairs to his station, duly clothes himself, and the brethren, previously clothed, repair to their seats.

Of our profession are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. BROTHERLY LOVE By the exercise of Brotherly Love, we are taught to regard the whole human species as one common family—the high, the low, the rich and poor, who, as created by one Almighty Parent, and inhabitants of the same planet, are sent into the world to aid, support, and protect each other. On this principle Free Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise remain at a perpetual distance. RELIEF To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but particularly upon Masons, who are linked together by an indissoluble chain of sincere affection; to soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to ~compassionate their miseries, and restote peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view. On this basis we form our friendships, and establish our connections. 4 r MANUAL OF \\\\ORK TRUTH Is a divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue; to be good men and true, is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we con - template, and by its dictates endeavot to regulate our conduct, hence, while influenced by this prin - ciple, hypoctisy and deceit are unknown among us; sincerity and plain dealing characterize us, and the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s wel - fare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity.

B.. As you are now introduced into the first prin - ciples of Masonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this Ancient and Honorable Order— ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial, and honorable, as tending, in every particular, so to render all men who will be conformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a better principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maKims laid down than are inculcated in the several Masonic lectures. The greatest and best of men in all ages, have been encouragers and promoters of the Art; and have never deemed it derogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, extend their privi - leges, and patronize their assemblies. There are three great duties, which in your new character, you are charged to practice and incuLcate: to God, your neighbor and yourself. To God in never mentioning His Holy Name but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his Creator; to implore His aid in all your laudable undertakings; and esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in acting upon the square, and doing unto him as you wish he should do unto you; and to yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and in - temperance, which ma~ impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your profession. A zealous attachment to and practice of these duties, will insure public and private esteem. In the State you are to be a quiet and peaceful citizen, true to your government~ and just to your country; you are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you live. In your outward demeanor. be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach. You are not to suffer your zeal for the Institution to lead you into argument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it. At your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you are to converse with well informed brethren, who will be always as ready to give, as you will be to receive, instruction. Finally, keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the Order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your conse - quence among Masons. If, in the circle of your acquaintance, a person applies to you who may be desirous of being initiated into the secrets of Ma - sonry, be particularly careful not to afford him any encouragement, unless you are convinced he ~vill conform to our rules; in which event, you may refer him to those who have authority to recommend him to the Lodge, that the honor, glory, and reputation of the Institution may be firmly established, and the world at large convinced of its good effects. Such is the arrangement of the different sections of the first Lecture, which, with the forms adopted in opening and closing the Lodge, comprehends the whole of the first degree in Masonry. This plan, while it has the advantage of regularity to recommend ii, has the support of authority, and the sanc- tion and respect which flow from antiquity. The whole is a regular system of morality, conceived in a strain of interesting allegory, which must unfold its beauties to every candid and industrious enquirer."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Degree of Fellow Craft Masonry is a progressive science, and is divided into different classes or degrees for the more regular advancement of its professors in the knowledge of its mysteries. According to the progress we make, we are led to limit or extend our enquiries, and in proportion to the genius or capacity with which it has pleased our Almighty Father to bless us, we attain to a greater or less degree of perfection. The first degree ot Masonry is well calculated to enforce the duties of morality, and to imprint on the memory the noblest principles which can adorn the human mind. Therefore it is the best introduction to the second degree, and not only ex - tends the same plan, but comprehends a more diffusive system of knowledge. SECTION I. The first section recapitulates the ceremony of initiation into this class, and instructs the diligent Craftsman how to proceed in the proper arrangement of the ceremonies used on the occa - sion, and should, therefore, be well understood by every officer and member of the Lodge Here the candidate is instructed in, and insested with, those particular tests, which enable him to prove his title to the privileges of this degree, and satisfac - tory reasons are given for the same.

The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations in life, before God and man, squaring our actions by the Square of virtue; and by the Level a King is reminded that, although a crown may adorn the head, and a sceptre the hand, yet the blood in his veins is derived from the same Almighty Parent, and is no better than ihat of the humblest citizen, and teaches us all that we are travelling on the broad level of time to that un - discovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns. SECTION II. This section has reference to the origin of the institution. Masonry is considered under two denominations—Operative and Speculative. The period is fixed for rewarding merit, the character of thai reward designated, and the inimitable moral to which that circumstance alludes, is explained. OPERATIVE MASONRY By Operative Masonry, we allude to a proper appli - cation of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty, and whence will result a due proportion and just correspondence in all its parts. It furnishes us with dwellings and convenient shelters from the vicissi - tudes and inclemencies of the seasons; and while it displays the effect of human wisdom, as well in the choice as in the arrangement of the sundry materials of which an edifice is composed, it demon - strates that a fund of science and industry is im - planted in man, for the best, most salutary and beneficent purposes. SPECULATIVE MASONRY By Speculative Masonry, we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep the tongue of good report, maintain secrecy, and practice charity. It is so far interwoven with religion as to lay us under obligation to pay that rational homage to the Deity, which at once constitutes our duty and our happiness.

ITS ANTIQUITY From the first foundation of Society, Order in Architecture may be traced When the rigor of seasons obliged men to contrive shelters from the tnclemency of the weather, we learn that they first planted trees on end, and then laid others across to support the covering. The bands which connected those trees at top and bottom are said to have given rise to the idea of base and capital of pillars; and from this simple hint originally proceeded the more improved att of Architecture.

To these the Romans have added two—the Tuscan, which they made plainer than the Done, and the Composite, which is nothing more than the Corinthian enriched with the Ionic volute.

THE ADVANTAGE OF GEOMETRY By this Science the Architect is enabled to construct his plans and execute his destgns; the General to arrange his soldiers and mark out his lines for en - campment; the Geographer to give us the dimen - sions of the earth, and all things therein contained; to delineate the extent of seas, and specify the divisions of empires, kingdoms and provinces.

Numberless worlds are around us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of Nature. A survey of Nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions, first determined man to imi - tate the Divine Plan, and study symmetry and order. This gave rise to societies, and birth to every useful art; the Architect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being improved by experience and time, have produced works whieh are the ad. - miration of every age. The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance, and the devastations of war, have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been employed Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and constructed by so many celehrated Artists, escaped not the unsparing ravages of barbarous force.

Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth as a flower and is cut down; he fleeth as a shadow and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with Thee, Thou hast appointed his bounds that he capnot pass, turn from him that he may rest, till he shall accomp - lish as a hireling his day. For there is hope of a tree if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down, and riseth not up again till the heavens shall be no more. Yet, 0 Lord! have com - passion on the children of Thy creation, administer them comfort in the time of trouble, and save them with an everlasting salvation. So mote it be—Amen.

MANUAL OF CEREMONIES 3 Installing Officer: Most Worshipful Brother—for from henceforth you are en - titled to be hailed—in inducting you to your chair of office, as a symbol of the commencement of your government over the Craft, I am performing a most solemn duty. By immemorial usage and the irrevocable landmarks of Freemasonry, you are invested, as Grand Master of Masons in Virginia, with powers and prerogatives which are well-nigh absolute. The interests of the Craft, for weal or for woe, are placed in your hands during your term of office. The good resolutions, formed in your own mind, that these powers shall not be abused or perverted by you. I would gladly strengthen by a word of admonition, which it will not become me hence - forth to utter. The very consciousness of the possession of a great power will ever make a generous mind cautious and gentle in its exercise. To rule has been the lot of many, and requires neither strength of intellect nor soundness of judgement; to rule well has been the fortune of but few, and may well be the object of an honorable anibition. It is not by the strong arm or the iron will that obedience and order, the chief requisites of good government, are secured but by holding the key to the hearts of men. The Office of Grand Master of Masons is of great antiquity and respect, and is one of the highest dignities to which we may aspire. Its incumbent, to rule well, should possess and practice several important requisites. As a man, he should be of approved integrity and irre - proachable morals; free from the domination of hasty temper and ill-governed passions; of good repute in the world; and practic - ing, as an example to the Craft, the Cardinal Virtues of Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance and Justice. As a citizen, he should be loyal to his government, obedient to its laws, prompt in the duties he owes to society, and a pattern of fidelity in all social and domestic relations.

You are also to act for him in all matters delegated to you. Your office, therefore, is one of great dignity and importance; and it was in view of these considerations that your brethren selected you to fill it.

Brought by his official position more intimately in - to communication with the whole body of the Fratemity, it is requisite that he should possess ability, skill and industry to meet the various demands upon him. Placed in a position where he holds almost constant correspondence with our Masonic brethren of every state and country, upon him devolves, in a large degree, the good name and credit of the Masonic family of this Common - wealth.

And, as this ritual has enshrined within it, in symbol and al - legory, certain great and essential moral truths, you should be as perfect in the symbolism as in the mere formula of language which teaches us how our rites are to be administered. As Grand Lecturer, also, you should be Master of the Ceremonial obser - vances of the Fraternity, and give instruction in the manner of rendering them so that they will be most striking and effective. You are the preceptor of the Fraternity, and your deportment should be consistent with the nature of your office and work.

(After presentatton, the installing Of ftcer wtll address the Iliaster-elect in the words following.) Previous to your investiture, it is necessary that you should signify your assent to those ancient charges and regulations which point out the duty of the Master of a Lodge. 1. You agree to be a good man and true, and strictly to obey the moral law. 2. You agree to be a peaceful citizen, and cheerfully conform to the laws of the country in which you reside. 3.

Do you submit to, and promise to support them, as Masters have done in all ages before you? Answer.—I do. In consequence of your cheerful conformity to the charges and regulations of the Order, you are now to be installed Master of the Lodge, in full confidence of your care, skill, and capacity to govern the same. The new Master is than regularly invested with the insignia of his office, and presented with the furmt’ure and implements of his Lodge all of which are carefully enumerated and duly commented on I now invest you with the badge of your office, the Square, which will silently admonish you to do justice to the cause of Masonry; give due commendation to the worthy members of the Order, and rebuke those who act contrary to its laws. The Holy Writings, the great light in Masonry will guide you to all truth; it will direct your path to the temple of happiness, and point out the whole duty of man. The Square teaches us to regulate our actions by rule and line, and harmonize our conduct by the principles of morality and virtue. The Compasses teaches us to limit our desires in every station, that, rising to eminence by virtue and merit, we may live respected and die regretted. The Rule diiects that we should punctually observe our duty, press forward in the path of virtue, and neither inclining to the right nor to the left, in all our actions have eternity in view. The Line teaches the criterion of moral rectitude, to avoid dissimulation in conversation and action, and to direct your steps to the path which leads to a glorious immortality. The Book of Constitutions you are to search at all times, cause it to be read in your Lodge, that none may pretend ignor - ance of the excellent precepts it enjoins. I now present you with the Charter of your Lodge which you will carefully preserve; see that no improper use is made of it, and safely transmit it to your successor m office. You will also receive in charge the by-laws of your Lodge, which you are to see carefully and punctually executed. And now I present you with the emblem of authority, the Gavel. As the sceptre in the hands of the King, so is the Gavel in the hand of the Master. Use it, not arbitrarily, but prudently and, if occasion require, firmly. I now present you with a hat. It is your province to remain covered while the rest of the brethren remain uncivered during the sessions of your Lodge. The origin of this Masonic tradition may be founded upon the wearing of a crown by King Solomon as a mark of dignity. Rulers and kings since his time have worn their crowns on cere - monial occasions as a symbol of their dignity and authority and their subjects have, as a mark of respect, uncovered in their presence. The wearing of your hat when occupying the chair of the Worshipful Master symbolizes the dignity and authority of your office and distinguishes you from the rest of the Craft. After hat has been presented, the installing Officer will call the Lodge up with three raps and call upon the brethren to salute the Worshipful Matter. (One map to seat the Lodge) Charge To The Master Worshipful Sir: Being chosen Master of this Lodge, you cannot be insensible of the obligations which devolve on you as their head; nor of your responsibility for the faithful discharge of the important duties annexed to your appointment. The honor reputation, and usefulness of your Lodge will materially depend on the skill and assiduity with which you manage its concerns, while the happiness of its members will be materially promoted in proportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the genuine principles of our Institution. For a pattern of imitation, consider the Great Luminary of Nature, which, rising in the East, regularly diffuses light and lustre to all within its circle. In like manner, it is your province to spread and communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your Lodge.

Charge them to practice out of the Lodge those duties which are inculcated in it; and by amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct to convince mankind of the goodness of the Institution so that when any one is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out it’s sorrows; to whom distress may prefer its suit; whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence. In short, by a diligent observance of the by-laws of your Lodge, the Constitutions of Masonry, and, above all, the Holy Scriptures, which are given as a rule and guide to your faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with honor and reputation, and lay up a crown of rejoicing which shall continue till time shall be no more. The subordsnate officers are then soverally i,svested by the presiding officer, who deliveis to each of them a short charge. Charge To The Senior Warden Brother C. U.: You are chosen Seniqr Warden of this Lodge, and are now invested with the ensign of your office. The Level demonstrates that we are descended from the same stock, partake of the same nature, and share the same hope; and though distinctions among men are necessary to preserve subordination, yet no eminence of station should make us forget that we are brethren; for he who is placed on the lowest spoke of fortune’s wheel may be entitled to our regard because a time will come, and the wisest knows not how soon, when all distinctions but those of merit and goodness shall cease, and Death, the grand leveler of human greatness, reduce us to the same state. Your regular and punctual attendance on our stated meetings is essentially necessary. In the absence of the Master you are to govern this Lodge; in his presence, you are to assist him in the government of it. I firmly rely on your knowledge of Masonry, and attachment to the Lodge, for the faithful discharge of the duties of this important trust. Look well to the West! Charge To The Junior Warden Brother E. F.: You are chosen Junior Warden of this Lodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office. The Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations, to hold the Scales of Justice in equal poise; to observe the just medium between intemperance and pleasure; and to make our passions and prejudices coincide with the line of our duty. To you is committed the superintendence of the Craft during the hours of refreshment; it is therefore indispensably necessary that you should not only be temperate and discreet in the in - dulgence of your own inclinations, but carefully observe that none of the Craft be suffered to convert the means of refreshment into intemperance or excess. Your regular and punctual attendance is particularly re - quested; and I have no doubt you will faithfully execute the duty which you owe to your present appointment. Look well to the South! Charge To The Treasurer Brother G. H.: You are chosen Treasurer of this Lodge, and I invest you accordingly. It is your duty to receive all moneys from the hands of the Secretary; keep a fair and just account of the same, and pay them out as you may be ordered by the Worshipful Master or by vote of the Lodge. I trust your regard for the interest of the Fraternity will prompt you to the faithful discharge of the duties of your office. Charge To The Secretary Brother I. K.: You are chosen Secretary of this Lodge, and now invested accordingly. It is your duty carefully to observe the proceedings of the Lodge; keep a fair record of all things proper to be written; receive all moneys due the Lodge, and pay them over to the Treasurer, taking his receipt for the same. Li"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"22 MANUAL OF CEREMONIES Your good inclination to Masonry and this Lodge, I hope, will induce you to discharge your office with fidelity; and by so doing, you will merit and receive the esteem and applause of your brethren. Charge To The Senior and Junior Deacons Brothers L. M. and N. 0.: You are chosen Deacons of this Lodge, and I now invest you with the badges of your office. To you is especially entrusted the reception and accommodation of visiting brethren. It is also your province to attend on the Master and Wardens and to act as their proxies in all the active duties of the Lodge, particularly such as relate to the reception and conducting of candidates into the different Degrees of Masonry, and in the immediate and re - sponsible practice of our rites. Not doubting your vigilance and attention, I trust your faithful discharge of the duties of your offices will entitle you to the esteem of your brethren. Charge To The Chaplain Brother V. W.: You are appointed Chaplain of this Lodge and are now in- vested with the badge of your sacred office. The principles and precepts of Freemasonry are in strict accordance with the teach - ings of the Great Light in Masonry. These enlighten life and illumine love, and though Masonry is not a religion, it is essen - tially religious. In all her laws and teachings she stands for what - ever is good—a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night— pointing the way to a glorious immortality. In your hands may this badge prove a gospel of love, leading men to light and life everlasting by drawing them closer to the Great Architect of the Universe. Charge To The Stewards Brothers P. Q. and R. S.: You are appointed Stewards of this Lodge, and I now present you the badges of your office. The duties of your office are to assist in the collection of dues and subscriptions, to keep an ac - count of the Lodge expenses, to see that the tables are properly furnished at refreshment and that every brother is suitably pro- r MANUAL OF CEREMONIES 23 vided for, and generally to assist the Deacons and other officers in performing their duties. Your regular and early attendance will afford the best proof of your zeal and attachment to the Lodge. Charge To The Marshal Brother T. U.: You are appointed Marshal of this Lodge and I now invest you with the insignia of your office. The office you hold is an important one, as it is your duly to conduct all public processions of the Lodge, hence; the respectable appearance of the Craft, will in a great measure, depend upon your energy, promptness and decision. Charge To The Tiler Brother T. U.: You are appointed Tiler of this Lodge, and I now invest you with the badge and implement of your office. As the sword is placed in the hands of the Tiler to enable him effectually to guard against the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, and suffer none to pass and repass but such as are duly qualified, so it should morally serve as a constant admonition to us to set a guard at the entrance of our thoughts, to place a watch at the door of our lips, and to post a sentinel at the avenue of our actions, thereby excluding every unqualified and unworthy thought, word, and deed, and preserving consciences void of offense towards God and towards man. Your early and punctual attendance will afford the best proof of your zeal for the Institution. Charge To The Brethren Generally Brethrenu Such is the nature of our Constitution that, as some must of necessity rule and teach, so others must of course learn to submit and obey. Humility in both is an essential duty. The officers who are appointed to govern your Lodge, and whom you have selected for that purpose, are sufficiently conversant with the rules of pro - priety and the laws of the Institution to avoid exceeding the F-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"1 MANUAL OF CEREMONIES 24 powers with which they ate entrusted; and you are, as Masons, of too generous dispositions to envy their preferment.

Finally, my brethren, as this association has been foimed and perfected in so much unanimity and concord, in which we greatly rejoice, so may it long continue. May you long enjoy every satis - faction and delight which disinterested friendship can afford. May kindness and brotherly affection distinguish your conduct as men and as Masons.

A thorough knowledge of the ritual, law, tradition, and his - tory of the Fraternity is essential to a proper conduct of this office.

(Then smntes him ~‘v so the E., calls isv the lodge end iays) Brethren, behold your District Deputy Grand Master and salute him accordingly— (Turns over gavel to D.D.G.M who seats the lodge, end, if disposed, gives an address) MANUAL OF CEREMONIES 27 Ceremony For The Public Installation of The Lo~1ge Officers The Installation of Lodge Officers in a ceremony open to the general public serves three main purposes: • The families of officers and members can share with each other the joy of attending an actual Lodge ceremony and take pride in the honor paid to loved ones and friends at that time. • Families and non-Masonic friends can learn something about the operation of a Lodge, the duties of its officers and the philosophies of the Masonic fraternity. • An open-to-the-public event helps overcome a general mis - conception about the secrecy of Freemasonry, and can, therefore, promote a greater appreciation of and esteem for the institution. To assure that these three purposes are adequately accom - plished, the Lodge planning a public installation must take extra care in arranging for and conducting the ceremony. Without this care and planning, the installation may be ineffective and bring embarrassment, if not actual disfavor to the Lodge and to Masonry in general. Perhaps there are some Lodges that have wanted to hold a public installation, but have refrained from doing so because of uncertainty and the proper procedures to be followed. The same order of installing officers and the same recapitulation of their duties as found in the regular installation ceremony within the tiled Lodge are used in the public installation. However, because it is an event open to the public, certain arrangements and pro - cedures that we are accustomed to in a tiled Lodge are changed in the public ceremony. These instructions describe the specific arrangements that should be made. Also discussed are several planning actions and means of assisting the Lodge Committees responsible for the suc - cess of the public ceremony in all of its details. A careful ob - servance of the points discussed here will help to secure an ef - yI~"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"1 28 MANUAL OF CEREMONIES fective ceremony and make it one that will achieve the three purposes mentioned, and assuring that it will reflect credit on the Lodge, its officers and members. Advanced Plans and Required Actions The Installing Officer: For the time being this officer will hold the center of the stage and must know what is required. Arrangements should be made well in advance of the installation date to secure the services of a brother to conduct the installa - tion. In order to make the ceremony as impressive and meaning - ful as possible the Installing Officer should perform the entire ritual thereof from memory. This is usually a prerequisite to re - ceiving permission from the Grand Master to hold a public in - stallation. Meeting Place: If the attendance is expected to exceed the Lodge’s seating capacity, or if other circumstances make it desir - able to hold the installation in another place, arrangements for such an alternative meeting place should be made at an early date. Dispensation: A Dispensation from the Grand Master is necessary in order to hold a public installation. Request therefor, made through your District Deputy Grand Master, should be made early enough so that there will be no uncertainty in the rest of the details of planning to be carried out. Your request should include the date and hour to be held, the location, if dif - ferent from your regular meeting place, and the fact that the cere - mony will be performed by someone who will be able to do so from memory. Please allow at least one month as a minimum time to receive this dispensation. When it is received have it in the Lodge on the night of the ceremony for the inspection of the installing officer, but it is not to be read at the installation ceremony. List of Officers to be Installed: Such a list should be fur - nished to the Installing Officer for his use during the ceremony. Include the first, middle and last names of each officer to be installed and the office to which he has been elected or appointed. MANUAL OF CEREMONIES 29 Installing Marshal: The Marshal will escort all of the officers during the ceremony. lie will also invest them with jewels and aprons at the proper time in the installation ceremony for each of them. It would be helpful to designate a Deputy Marshal to assist in this investiture. Officers Attire: If the Officers normally wear tuxedos to Lodge Communications, they should also be clothed in them on this occasion. If tuxedos are not available dark blue suits, white shirts and black bow ties may be worn in order to have some uniformity of dress. White gloves are approptiate, if desired. Printed Programs: If desired by the Master and his Officers a printed program for the occasion would be of interest. It should show the Lodge Name and Number, its charter date, names of officers and the title of the office in which each is being installed; the name of the Installing Master and Marshal together with others who have been appointed for the occasion as well as an order of events for the evening. Minutes of the Meeting: The Secretary should incorporate the pertinent information as to the date, time, place and names of the Installing Officer and Marshal in the minutes of the fol - lowing stated communication. Physical Arrangements in The Lodge Room Lodge Set-Up. The Officers chairs should be in their normal positions except that the chair of the Tiler should be moved inside the Lodge room and immediately behind the place of the Junior Deacon. Place the Holy Bible upon the Altar, open ii to a place near the middle of the book. Do not place the Square and Compasses. on it. The three tapers may be placed in the traditional form about the Altar, but these are not to be lighted. If the Lodge has an altar cover that is in good condition this should be used by all. means. Music: Appropriate music may be played prior to the cere. mony and while the newly installed Officer is being escorted to his place. Such music is not a part of the ceremony itself."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"30 MANUAL OF CEREMONIES MANUAL OF CEREMONIES 31 Public Address System: A public address system is often de - sirable in a large room, but is not absolutely required. After all the ceremony is meaningless unless the people can hear as well as see what is going on. The Gavel: Throughout the ceremony of installation the Gavel is not used to have the audience stand or sit; instead an oral request is made by the presiding officer. Conducting The Meeting • The outgoing Master, at the hour appointed for the meet - ing, should approach the Altar and open the Bible at a place near the middle of the Book. He should then move to the East of the Lodge room and request the audience to stand for prayer. • A non-ritualistic prayer should be given at that time by the Master, Chaplain or some other member of the Craft. • At the conclusion of the prayer, the Master will request the guests and brethren to be seated. He may offer a brief ex - planation of the ceremony and extend a word of welcome to the guests who are present. He should then request the Installing Officer to approach the East. • The ceremony of installation will then begin with the calling of the names of the officers elected and appointed, who are to be installed and follow in the manner prescribed for the regular installation service, after the officers have taken the ob - ligation shown thei em. • In connection with the Ritual for Installation for the Master, the following points are observed: 1. The Lodge Charter is symbolically (not physically) pre - sented to the Worshipful Master, but it must be in the hands of the Installing Officer. If the charter is framed it may be used in the frame but if in a case of other repository, it should be re - moved ~or the purposes of this occasion. 2. The Gavel is symbolically presented. Thereafter the in - stalling Officer extends his right hand to the newly installed Master and helps him ascend to the East and take his place on the Installing Officers left, half-facing him. The Installing Officer then offers the following suggested explanation of the significance of the hat: “It is your province to remain covered while the rest of the brethren remain uncovered during the sessions of your Lodge. “The origin of this Masonic tradition may be founded upon the wearing of a crown by King Solomon as a mark of dignity. Rulers and kings since his time have worn their crowns on cere. monial occasions as a symbol of their dignity and authority and their subjects have, as a mark of respect, uncovered in their pres. ence. “The wearing of your hat when occupying the chair of the Worshipful Master symbolizes the dignity and authority of your office and distinguishes you from the rest of the Craft.” • The Installing Officer then presents the Master his hat and requests him to wear it. He then requests everyone to join in applauding the new Worshipful Master. • Thereafter the Installing Officer completes the final charge to the Master, beginning with the words “Worshipful Sir, being chosen Master of this Lodge, you cannot be insensible. . . .“ The Master will then remove his hat and sit to the left of the Installing Officer. • Installs all other Officers (“Assistant Officers” such as Assistant Secretary, Assistant Chaplain, etc. are not installed.) The Installing Officer will request the Marshal to present officers for installation in the same order as prescribed in the Installatioft Ritual. He will say: “Bro. Marshal, present the next officer to be installed.” The Marshal will escort him from his seat behind the Altar and present him at the foot of the East, giving his name and office to be occupied. (e.g. I present Bro. John T. Smith for installation as Junior Warden.) • The Marshal, in escorting the Treasurer and Senior Deacon to their chairs, will conduct them directly to their proper place. This is done rather than going around the Altar as in a tiled Lodge."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"32 MANUAL OF CEREMONIES MANUAL OF CEREMONIES 33 • At the conclusion, the Installing Officer will instruct the Marshal to make the Proclamation. The Marshal should stand just West of the Altar (facing the East) and make the ritualistic Proclamation, following which he will face the South, point his baton and say: “This Proclamation I make to the South.” He shall then face the West and say “This Proclamation I make to the West.” He shall then face the East and say: “This Proclama - tion I make to the East,” pointing the baton at each Station as he faces it. • Presentation of gifts (to the new Master; such as gloves, gavel, etc.) may be made at this time and thereafter the Installing Officer will yield his place to the Worshipful Master. The Worshipful Master Completes The Program • When the new Worshipful Master assumes his station, he does not wear the hat. • Any presentations to the immediate Past Master should be made at this time. • The Master makes any remarks he desires at this time. He may also choose to recognize at their seats all Past Masters, all Visiting Masters, the District Deputy Grand Master and any others he may consider appropriate. Such recognitions are entirely optional and if their number involves any considerable time they should be eliminated or kept to an absolute minimum. If the ‘Worshipful Master does desire to have some sort of a response for the guests, this should be pre-arranged. As this is not a tiled meeting, the usual presentations, escorts and saluting of dignitaries ~re not used. • The Master will thank the Lodge Committees which -planned the Installation, the Installing Officers and others to whom he feels indebted. He will express the pleasure of die offi - cers and brethren for the presence of the guests. Thereafter he will invite everyone to partake of refreshments, if such have been prepared. • He will conclude the formal part of the ceremony by call - ing upon a member of the Craft to give the closing prayer which should be non-ritualistic and given while standing West of the Altar."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"MANUAL OF CEREMONIES Ceremony For Laying Coriaer~Stones When conducted hy the Grand Master or Deputy Grand Master, the titles will he changed accordingly.

Exordium By the Master or some Brother appointed by him The ceremony which we are about to perform, or one com - parable, may likely be ascribed to the operative craftsmen of the middle ages who built the great castles and cathedrals in Europe and the British Isles. Even earlier, we know that the outstanding citizens of Rome gathered to assist in lowering the cornerstones of its public buildings into place."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"36 MANUAL OF CEREMONIES MANUAL OF CEREMONIES 37 This tradition indicates the deeply spiritual attitude of our fraternal ancestors. Each accepted his particular talent as a gift of God, and to Him each consecrated the fruits of his labor. The stone itself is supposed to be a perfect cube, and each side a perfect square. The cube symbolized Truth to the Easterner and the Square Morality. Hence, Perfect Truth and Perfect Morality, both at - tributes of God, caused the stone to be an evidence of the Divine in man~s undertaking. Believing that all enduring things must be built upon the strong foundation of the Almighty, it became the first stone set into place by our operative ancestors. Thereupon rested the whole structure, physically and spiritually. It was placed in the northeast corner. To them the north was a place of darkness, the east a place of light. The former signifying evil and the latter good, and in between stood God. They thought of the cement or adhesive force as a symbol of love. As it was spread with the trowel to hold the building together, so does the overwhelming element of love, of God for man, of man for God, and of man for man, hold them together in perfect unity. The necessity of that bond of love was then and is now held forth to us if our work is to be fruitful. The stone is first lowered by three distinct movements. This would admonish us to be circumspect in all our actions in the erection of our spiritual edifice, and indicates our progress through youth, manhood and old age. Once the stone is set, it should not be moved, for the God we worship and the attributes which we ascribe to him are unchangeable and immovable. We test the stone and our work with the plumb, square and level, both to be sure that we have not used an imperfect symbol, and to remind us that in all our dealings in life we should strive towards that perfection which is Divine, which will keep us clean of body, soul and mind, living before the world an example of righteousness, and professing that under God, all men are equal. Thus the stone may be declared a symbol of perfect morality, per - fect rectitude in life and perfect equality . . . in essence, Divine. The stone thus set in place, with the work which is to follow, is then consecrated with the age-old elements of corn, wine and oil. The corn is a symbol of plenty, representing the bounteous provision made for our physical existence; the wine is a symbol of refreshment which, together with rest, is enjoyed by the traveler at the completion of his journey; the oil is a symbol of joy and gladness used to annoint those who were particularly honored. Taken together they teach the important lesson that a portion of our corn should go to feed the hungry, a cup of wine should be sent to cheer the sorrowful and we should pour the healing oil of consolation into the wounds of the afflicted. These are all the gifts of God, and as a further evidence of our belief in His bene - ficence, we acknowledge in this sacrifice of consecration that all things come of Him. Finally, we engage in prayer, not only for the safety and guidance of the builders, but for the prosperity of the building to be erected. Being built on the strong foundation of our faith in God, it should be used for his glory.

All parts of the universe are symbolic; each one of which was, no doubt, designed by the Creator to reveal, and impress upon the mind, some special idea or sentiment.

One rap. The Deacons will immediately cover the Lodge with the cloth removed at the beginning of the ceremony. The Explanatory Lecture is then delivered: Explanatory Lecture. The ceremonies which we have performed here are not un - meaning rites, nor the amusing pageants of an idle hour, but each has a solemn and instructive import. Permit me to point out to you, and to impress upon your minds the ennobling sentiments they are so well adapted to convey. This Hall, designed and built by Wisdom, supported by Strength and adorned by Beauty, we first consecrated in the name of the great Jehovah. This teaches us, in all our works, begun and finished, to acknowledge, adoxe and magnify Him. It re - minds us, also, to enter the door of the Lodge in His fear, to put our trust in Him while passing through its trials, and to hope in Him for the reward of its labors. Let, then, the altar at the center of this Lodge be devoted to His service and the lofty arch of its ceiling resound with His praise. May the eye which seeth in secret witness here the sincere and unaffected piety which withdraws from the engagements of the world to silence and privacy, that it may be exercised with less interruption and less ostentation. Our march around the Lodge reminds us of the travels of human life, in which Masonry is an enlightened, a safe and pleas - ant path. ]ts tessellated pavement of Mosaic work intimates to us the checkered diversity and uncertainty of human affairs. Our step is time; our progression, eternity. Following our ancient Constitutions, with mystic rites we dedicate this Hall to Freemasonry. Our best attachments are due to the Craft. In its prosperity we find our joy, and, paying it honor, we honor ourselves. But its worth transcends our highest praise, and its glory will outsound our anthems. Brethren, it is a matter of pride that we have our names inscribed on the record of Freemasonry. May it be our highest ambition that they should shed luster upon the immortal page. This Hall has also been dedicated to Virtue. This worthy approbation will always be duly regarded, while the moral duties which our sublime lectures inculcate, with af - fecting and impressive pertinency, are cherished in our hearts and illustrated in our lives. As Freemasonry aims to enliven the spirit of Philanthropy, and promote the cause of Charity, so we dedicate this Hall to Universal Benevolence, in the assurance that every brother will dedicate his affections and his abilities to the same generous pur - pose; that while he displays a warm and cordial affection to those who are of the Household of the Faith, he will extend his ben - evolent regards and good wishes to the whole family of mankind. Such, my brethren, is the significant meaning of the solemn rites we have just performed, because such are the peculiar duties of every Lodge. We need not enlarge upon them now, nor show how they diverge, as rays from a center, to enlighten, improve and to cheer the whole circle of life.

Things to R~m~mb~ir 1—Appoint a Committee to see that each person to be in - troduced completes the proper registration slip. 2—Where possible, and in order to avoid delays, set up a table or tables at which various groups can register simultaneously; give consideration to the preparation of a placard showing, for example, “Worshipful Masters wrn please register here,” etc. Station a member of the Registration Committee at each Regis - tration Station to collect registration slips immediately upon com - pletion. After final registration, the completed slips should be handed to the Worshipful Master of the host Lodge in order that he may turn them over to those who will be making the introduc - tions or presentations (it will facilitate handling if ordinary papei clips are used to keep various categories separated). After each presentation the Committee should hand these registration slips to the Secretary for recording in the minutes. 3—Determine that all equipment essential for the presenta - tion of the Grand Master is in place, i.e., clean white gloves for Presentation Committee members, candles, matches, etc. 4—Make certain that seating arrangements are adequate, also determine that there is a sufficient supply of clean white aprons on hand. 5—Alert the members of Presentation Committees to be present and prepared for the meeting; enter their names on the lines provided in this outline. Stress to them the desirability of brief introductions; emphasize that introductions are made to the Worshipful Master and not “through you to the Lodge, etc.” 6—Determine the Grand Master’s pleasure concerning his preference for members of the Committee named to present him. 7—Prior to the meeting ask the Grand Master when he de - sires to present his remarks; also, determine if he desires to close the Lodge and/or give the Charge at closing. 8—Work out in detail the program for the evening. Pre - sentation of an advance copy of the agenda to the Grand Master would be most appreciated. 9—Appoint someone to extinguish or dim the lights when the Grand Master enters the Lodge and to turn them on again when he is received in the East. (Lights are turned on again as the Grand Master mounts the third step or reaches the level of the Master’s chair when the East is on a raised platform or stage.) 10—If the Grand Master’s visit must be at a Stated Com - munication, limit all business to that which is absolutely necessary, remembering that the principle purpose of the meeting is to re - ceive the Grand Master. I 1—Clear all announcements, comments, etc., before the Grand Master rises to speak.

When a Lodge receives a request from the Master or Secre - tary of a Lodge in a Sister Grand Jurisdiction to conduct a Court - esy Funeral or hold an Evening Memorial Service for a Brother sojourning in the jurisdiction of the Lodge, the Grand Lodge of Virginia grants permission to conduct such Funeral Rites or Evening Memorial Service ONLY when cleared through the Offi - ces of the Grand Secretaries. The Lodge receiving such a request is expected to check the regularity of the requesting Lodge. This may be done by referring to the “List of Regular Lodges”, pub - lished by the Pantagraph Printing Company of Bloomington, Illinois. If the Lodge receives a request from an individual or Ehe family of a sojourning Mason for Funeral Rites or Evening Mem - orial Service and the deceased does not have a current dues card which would indicate both his own standing and the regularity of his Lodge, such request must also be handled through the office of the Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Virginia to be cleared with the Grand Lodge under which his Lodge is holden. The Master’s first duty, on being informed of the death of one of his members, is to call on the family. In making this call, he should do so merely for the purpose of conveying to them the sympathy of his brethren. This is, in no sense, a solicitation on his part to be allowed to conduct the Funeral Rites or Evening Mem - orial Service. If either is wanted by the family, they will make their wishes known. The Masonic Funeral Service was originally designed as a “graveside rite”. In recent years, the Grand Lodge, A. F. & A. M., of Virginia, approved an “Evening Memorial Service”, and this or the “amended ritual” of the older Service may be used at the funeral home, Chapel, Church or home of the deceased on the evening before interment. The Lodge of Sorrow covers both the “Evening Memoral Service” and the “Masonic Funeral Service”, as amended. According the graveside rites the preference due them because of their antiquity, it would probably be better to have an Evening Memorial Service if a proper attendance could not be secured for the graveside service. This is a matter for the Wor - shipful Master to decide, but it should not be settled without con - currence from the family of the deceased.

Optional Memorial Address “What doth the Lord require of thee, 0 man, but to do justly and love mercy and walk humbly with thy God. And one of the elders sayeth unto me: Rejoice ye and be exceedingly glad: behold the Lion of the Tribe of Judah hath prevailed to open the book and loosen the seven seals thereof.” These words from the Book of the Law remind us of the two great symbols of Free - masonry and that for which they stand—the white lamb-skin apron and the sprig of acacia. The lamb-skin, representing he that takes away the sins of the whole world and gives us that great peace which man cannot understand. The apron, representing the earth crowned by the triangle of the flap representing Deity, symbolizes for us the Brotherhood of man under the Fatheihood of God. The sprig of acacia represents that immortal or better part of man which, through the merits of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, survives the grave. By it we are also reminded o~ the promise of the resur - rection of the body, which will arise and become as incorruptible as our soul. Death is not the end but merely the gateway to an- other life. It is not a terminal but merely a milestone. For human existence continues after death, with different conditions. After passing through the gateway of death it enters upon a new and more exalted phase, one devoted to spiritual rather than material growth. It is in the life after passing beyond the grave that the human soul begins the life immortal in eternity. Man may often ask himself what becomes of the human soul but each of us must remember that this can only be answered by the use of the knowledge that the soul is the gift of God; the spark of the Divine in each of us. In the persons of these, our brethren, whom we memorialize here, the dust has returned unto dust and the spirit which is immortal has returned unto God who gave it. Let us not lose sight of the fact that immortality is an individual state and that each of us, created in the image of God, is capable of achieving, with his help, the state of being immortal.

AROUND THE BlESt M~ Bn~nnN: The last offices paid to the dead are useful as lessons to the living; from them we are to derive instruction and to consider every solemnity of this kind as a summons to prepare for our dissolution. Notwithstanding the warnings of mortality with which we daily meet; notwithstanding Death has established his empire over all the works of Nature, yet, through some unaccountable infatuation, we put from us the thought that we are born to die, We go on from one design to another, add hope to hope, and lay out plans for the employment of many years, Forgetting that we may be suddenly alarmed at the approach of Death, when we least evpect him, and at an hour which we probably conclude to be the meridian of our existence. Let the present occasion excite our most serious thoughts, and strengthen our resolutions of amendment.

Let Thy peace abide with us now and lead us ever in the paths of righteousness. In Thy name we make our prayer. Amen. Worshipful Master: From time immemorial it has been the custom of Masons to assemble with the family and friends of a departed Brother to honor his memory and to voice our sympathy to those whom he loved and who loved him. The message we bring is one of the triumph of life over death, the victory of hope over despair. Masonry has come down from the distant past. It uses the tools of the builder’s trade as emblems and symbols to teach Masons how to build character and moral stature. It teaches service to God, to a Brother, and to all mankind. It seeks con - stantly to build the temple of the soul and thus fit us for that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Masonry is a fellowship that unites Masons in friendship and good will. It teaches the spiritual values of life that lie beyond the physical senses. Masonry confronts the fact of death with the greater fact of Faith in the immortality of the soul. Masons believe sincerely that when life on earth comes to a close, the soul is translated from the imperfections of this mortal sphere to that all-perfect glorious and Celestial Lodge above where God, the Great Archi - tect of the Universe, presides. With these truths and convictions our Brother was well acquainted, though perfection of character is not of this world, yet we are persuaded that our Brother sought to live by these truths and principles of Masonry; that they sustained and sup - ported him and that by them his life was made richer, fuller and more meaningful. Secretary: Here the Secretary of the Lodge should give the Masonic biography oj the Brother. When and in what Lodge he was made a Master Mason; what of fices, ii any, he had held; and special committee services he had rendered and such other items of Masonic interest as might be appropriate.) Worshipful Master: When our Brother labored with us in Masonic attire he wore a white apron which he was taught is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Free and Accepted Mason. By it he was constantly reminded of that purity of life and that rectitude of conduct so necessary to his gaining admittance into the Celestial Lodge above. He will now wear that apron forever as the emblem of the virtues it represents. (The Master holds up ihe apron by the Iwo upper corners with the flap toward him, and places it over the edge of the casket.) The Evergreen is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the soul. By it we are reminded of the immortal soul of man which survives the grave and which will never, never die. In ac - cordance with our ancient custom, I now deposit this emblem with the remains of our Brother. And now to those who shared with our Brother the intimate ties of family and friendship, we tender our affectionate sympathy. Our hearts respond to your hearts in your hour of grief. We trust that these affirmations of faith, in which our Brother shared, may speak to you and inspire you to live with hope and courage. May you always remember that the God and Father of us all is a loving God, a compassionate God whose ear is ever open to the ~.ry of the distressed. Let us pray. Chaplain: Eternal and Everlasting God, we look to Thee in faith and confidence, knowing that Thy love has power to bring comfort and consolation, even in times of bereavement, to those near and dear to our Brother. Fill their hearts more and more with the blessed assurance of immortality and of Thy abiding love. Bless them and keep them, 0 Lord, make Thy face to shine upon them and be gracious unto them. Lift up Thy countenance upon them and give them Thy peace. Amen."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"MENTORS MANUAL Fourth Edition GRAND LODGE, A. F. & A M.

It is not possible to impart all of the knowledge necessary to produce a genera - tion of informed Masons in the brief time the Mentor will be active in the life of the candidate. The plan, therefore, must have as its main objective the promotion of an interest in Masonic knowledge. It must devise a means of creating a desire in the candidate to learn more about Masonry and point out to him the sources from which he will be able to obtain more light on those facets of it which he will find interesting to him. These, of course, will vary with the individual. It is not the objective of the Mentor Plan to teach the ritual nor is it generally recommended that the Mentor instruct the new Mason in the eatechisms which he is required to learn. In some Lodges it will be necessary that the same brother perform both functions because of the shortage of instructors. However, when this is the case care should be taken to avoid confusing the two subjects. The Mentor Plan will endeavor to acquaint the new brother with some of the history of Freemasonry, its philosophies and objectives. It should also give him some insight into the literature of the Fraternity wherein he may begin and continue his study of its teachings and doctrines. Instruction under the Mentor Plan must be individual and person - alized if it is to be effective. In embracing this system we are follow - ing the time-honored method of the l~’raternity, that of imparting in - struction from mouth-to-ear, for Freemasonry believes in and stresses the importance of the individual. Through the individual man it has sought and will continue to seek to implant the truth of its doctrines in the world. Thus the individual, as he comes to realize that he is Freemasonry to many people, will understand the necessity for him to exemplify its principles by walking uprightly before God and man, squaring his actions by the square of virtue. In the preparation of this Manual we have consulted the programs and pub]ications of our sister Grand Lodges and have borrowed ma - terial free’y from them when it seemed desirable to do so.

It. is not perfect nor is the system which it represents a perfect one. Time and experience alone will enable us to bring the jewel of Masonic education to its cull beauty. It is our hope that the thoughts presented here and the sources given will awaken the consciousness of the beauty o~ Freemasonry for those who come into our Lodges and study under this system. A.B.G. Bich4nond, Va~ October 1, 1962 Chapter I What Is A Mentor? The word Mentor is one which is defined in the dictionary as “a wise and faithful adviser, friend or teacher.” In the old operative Lodges of Scotland the officer entrusted with the task of instructing the new apprentices bore the title of Inten4er. IL~ was his duty to intend, increase and intensify the knowledge o~ the new Craftsman. The Mentor, in our present system, will seek to expand and intensify the Masonic instruction imparted by the ritual, adding to it many other points which will enlarge the new brother’s understanding of Freemasonry and its relationship to life in this twentieth century. The Mentor and the brethren must generally understand that the production of a generation of Masonic scholars is not the objective of this plan. Its motive is simply to indoctrinate each new Mason in the ways of Masonry, to create in him an understanding of things Masonic and arouse in his mind a feeling of pride in the Fraternity. In so doing it is hoped that he will learn that Freemasonry is a way of life which each may embrace with great satisfaction to himself. The instruction given must seek to capture the interest of the candidate as he begins his Masonic life. To properly accomplish this each candidate must have a Mentor assigned to him immediately after his election to receive the Degree of Entered Apprentice. It will be the Mentor’s duty to prepare the mind of the candidate for the reception of the great truths of Freemasonry and an appreciation of its tenets and teachings. The Worshipful Master of every Virginia Lodge has been requested to appoint an Educational Committee for his Lodge and to designate certain well-qualified, dedicated and enthusiastic brethren as Mentors. There should be a sufficient number of these brethren so that no Mentor would be required to serve more than two brethren at any one time. The assignment of candidates to the several Mentors may be done by either the Master or the Committee. Thereafter the Mentor should report the progress of each candidate at regular intervals. The scheduling of degree work should be governed by the candidate’s progress in both the catechisms and this part o~ his Masonic in - 5truction."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"4 MENTORS MANUAL The Method Explained It is necessary that our new brethren become imbued with the spirit of Freemasonry if we are to keep the Order strong and active. This must be done so that he will understand its great purpose and high ideals, and having understood, he shall believe in and practice them in his daily life. Years ago a plan of Masonic education was started in the Grand Lodge of Virginia and a number of booklets were printed. These were, for the most part, intended to be used by the candidate, for ihe system •was based on the reading and absorption of the written material by the candidate with occasional discussions between him and the Lodge Commit - tee. Emphasis has been lacking on the element of personal instruction in recent years The booklets have continued to be used by many of our Lodges but interest in Masonic education generally has waned. For some years the leadership of the Masonic Fraternity has known that it is too much to expect a man to come into a society such as ours and take his place unless he is guided by someone with a full understanding of its aims and objectives. Nor can we reasonably e~ - pect the new ~ason to find his place in his own Lodge and assume his part of its work without some heLp and interest from those who have gone before him. Our failure to prepare these new brethren for the discharge of their duties and the full enjoyment of their privileges has helped to produce a great number of dues-paying but inactive Masons. We have an obligation to each candidate and we must dis - charge it if we are to keep our Freemasonry strong and virile. The means of discharging our obligation is to be found in person - alized Masonic Education wherein the Mentor seeks to give the new brother instruction and information by word of mouth as well as through a printed text. Time must be provided in which the candi - date may ask and have his questions answered for him and this can only be accomplished by word-of-mouth instruction and personal contacts. The Mentor Pla,n does not eliminate the booklets which were pre - pared by Mt. Wor. William Moseley Brown. The candidate should teceive (C) Taking The First Step, (2;) The Degree of Enteied App?entlce, (3) The Degree of Fellowcraft and (4) The Degree of Master Mason. The first to be given prior to his initiation, the next three after each of the three degrees. Each of these are important text books in his education as a Mason. From them he will obtain much knowledge of our Fraternity which might not otherwise be his. MENTORS MANUAL 5. The Mentor Pla,n is intended to provide a means whereby the initiate, in each of the stages of his Masonic development, may receive added instruction and the answer to those questions which inevitably arise in the mind of the new iViason as he progresses through the degrees. Thus we shall attempt to place each initiate in possession of the key by which he will be able to unlock the door of understanding of Free - masonry and enable him to fit its teachings and philosophies to his own life. The objective of this manual is to enable the Mentor to find a ready reference for the many questions which will come to him and aid him in the task of imbuing those new brethrcn whom he will serve with the spirit of Freemasonry. He will also help each to attain an under - standing of its purposes and ideals. Each Mentor is urged to under - stand the importance of his mission if our plan of Masonic Education is to succeed and we are to preserve Freemasonry as one of the great and basic institutions for good in our complex twentieth century society. How The Mentor May Work The Mentor should visit the candidate immediately after his election and give him the booklet TcLking the First Step. He should also ex - plain to him that he is to be his Mentor, a friend who will endeavor to help him in learning something about Freemasonry and one who will guide and counsel him. The Mentor should also arrange a second meeting with him, allowing the candidate time to read the booklet. At Ihis meeting he should discuss with him the contents of the first booklet. The Mentor should also advise him of the time at which ~he degree will be conferred and arrange to be with him at ~he Lodge, except during the time he is actually in the hands of his conductor. The same routine should be followed with the degrees of Fellow- craft and Master Mason. The Brown booklets should be presented at the proper time and the candidate urged to read them. Let it be understood that the Mentor cannot discharge his responsibility by merely presenting the booklet~s and being with the candidate on the occasions mentioned. He must mcet with the new brother frequently and g~ive him that instruction which is so essentially necessary if he is to become a good Mason. He should be encouraged to ask questions and have them answered, provided the answers do not involve those degrees which he has not received or other secret information to which he will become entitled later. To provide a source of information from which the Mentor may be able to secure answers to some of the questions he will be asked, th~"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"6 MENTORS MANUAL following sections of this manual have been prepared. These will MENTORS MANUAL 7 cover, in part, Pre-initiation Instruction, that to be given the Entered Chapter II Apprentice, the Felloweraft and the Master Mason. Pre-Initiation Instruction The instruction to be given and the questions answered at this stage of the candidate’s introduction to Freemasonry can cover only the most general subjects. Some of the subjects on which questions will develop are recorded for the Mentor. Freemasonry Defined.—Freemasonry has many definitions for many men. Our English brethren define it as “a system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.” Certainly it is a course of moral instruction which employs both allegories and symbols to im - part the truth of its rich lessons. The word a,Ue gory is generally understood to mean that it “represents by suggestive resemblance.” The symbol is “a visible sign or representation of an idea.” Perhaps the best modern definition of Freemasonry is to be found in the writings of Bro. C. C. Hunt, of Iowa, couched in these words: “Freemasonry is an organized society of men symbolically applying the principles of operative Masonry and architecture to the science and art of character building.” This is an adequate definition and serves to set our Fraternity apart from other organizations which teach a system of morality. Its Purpose.—The basic purpose of Freemasonry is to make man better than himself. As our Institution places emphasis on the in - dividual man, its mission is accomplished by strengthening his char. acter, improving his moral and spiritual outlook and broadening his mental horizons. By the inculcation of its teachings Freemasonry seeks to impress upon the minds of its members the principles of personal responsibility and righteousness, to give each an understand - ing of and feeling for its charity, and endeavors to encourage each to put these lessons into practice in his daily life. Thus does it seek to build a better world by first building better men to work at this self-appointed task in their own communities. Freemasonry believes in uni’~ersal peace made possible by the acceptance of its great doctrine of the Brotherhood of Man under the Fatherhood of God. Freemasonry also seeks to enlighten the mind of man by placing within his grasp a reasonable understanding of the persistence of life through both time and eternity. In the frame work of its teachings each man may find a philosophy of life which wi.ll fit his own need. Its Origin.—To point to a single era in human history and say that Freemasonry was born at that particular time and in a specific place is not possible. It may be as old as man himself, for its roots spread"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"8 MENTORS MANUAL MENTORS MANUAL S through many ages and among all races of people. Certainly it goes far beyond historical record, though it has not always been designated by the name Freemasonry. Even the savages of prehistoric times had certain ritualistic ceremonies for the young man as he sought to take his rightful place among the tribal leaders. Initiation was a ceremony prevalent among the ancients; and the mysteries of Egypt, Greece and the East may be seen as influencing our own rites. These were designed to test men and to admit only those who were worthy into the fellowship. To those who won the right to be initiated was promised the key which vvould unlock the secrets of the universe. Operative Masonry can be traced back through the centuries to the Middle Ages and beyond, for man has long been a builder both by necessity and by inspiration, seeing in the world around him the evidences of a Supreme Builder and seeking to imitate Him. [n the course of time the operative masons bound themselves together in compaiiies or guilds. Other men were admitted only after they had served a number of years of apprenticeship, had learned some of the secrets of the builder’s art and demonstrated their ability as crafts - men. The transition of Freemasonry from an operative art to a specula - tive science came about so gradually that it is difficult to pin-point it in the history of the Craft. Patrons who were not operative artisans were taken into the craft, and others who were non-operative followed. The tools and implements of the builder had long been used to sym - bolize moral precepts. In this period of change Freemasonry came to regard these tools and implements almost entirely as spiritual symbols. Thus their use became exclusively philosophical and figura - tive, teaching men the universal principles of morality and brotherly love. At this point in its long history Freemasonry changed from operative to speculative. The Grand Lodge Era.—Modern speculative Freemasonry as we know it today owes its structure to the Grand Lodge. The history of Masonic Grand Lodges all over the world is carefully documented and fully covered by Masonic historians. The beginnings of almost every Grand Lodge in the world may be read in Gould’s History of Freemasonry, or that written by Mackey and edited by Clegg, Haywood and others. Historical sketches are printed in numerous other books which are available to the new brother. The first Grand Lodge under our system of speculative DAasonry was organized in London in 171’7, now known as the United Grand Lodge of England. holden under immemorial right, every regular Masonic Lodge today exists by virtue of a charter or warrant from a Grand Lodge Each Grand Lodge is autonomous in its own jurisdiction. The Grand Lodge is composed of the Grand Master, the Deputy Grand Master, the Grand Wardens, the Grand Treasurer, the Giand Secretary, the Past Grand Masters, the Past District Deputy Grand Masters. ihe Past Grand Wardens, the representalives of the Subordinate Lodges, the District Deputy Grand Masters, and Past Masters of Subordinate Lodges not in - cluded in any of the previous categolies In some Grand Lodges the Past Masters and Lodge Secretaries are also members of the Grand Lodge. It is governed, when in session, by the Grand Master assisted by varying numbers of Grand Lodge Officers, both elected and appointed When the Grand Lodge is not in session most of its powers are vested in the Grand Master. The powers of a Grand Lodge a~e legislative, executive and judicial Titles of Grand Lodges.—Titles of Grand Lodges vary from one geo - graphical location to another. For the purpose of this section only the titles used by the Grand Lodges of the United States will be discussed. The first of these is A.F. & A.M., meaning Ancient, Free and Ac - cepted Masoiis. The word Ancient has many connotations with Free - masonry other than that of age. The chief among these goes back to what historians have termed the great schism in English Freemasonry when the Fraternity was divided into two factions. This was probably a rivalry, the Antients being founded by certain Irish artisans in London because they were refused admission to Lodges holden under ~he Grand Lodge. The term Antient.s and Moderns was first used by McDermott, the first Grand Secretary of the Antients. He appLied the epithet Moderns to the older Grand Lodge as a term of derision. As used today by American Grand Lodges, the term Ancient simply means that Freemasonry is old. The Royal Art is not practiced today in the United States according to the ritual of the Antients. Being nearly equally divided, most of the remaining Grand Lodges in the U.S. have as part of their titles the letters F. & A.M., meaning Free and Accepted Masons. These Grand Lodges probably left the word Ancient out of their title to avoid any possible connection with the Antient segment of English Freemasonry. Two other designations are found in two American Grand L~odges. In South Carolina the title is the Grand Lodge A.F.M., signifying Ancient Free Masons. In the District of Columbia the Grand Lodge is designated F.A.A.M., Free And Accepted Masons. While there are Lodges with historical records earlier than 1717, these were not Grand Lodges. With the exception of a few Lodges"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"I0 MENTORS MANUAL There are two words in these titles which may be further explained. They are free and accepted. The ancient operative craftsmen were men of such skill and their Craft considered indispensable to the welfare of both church and state. For this reason they were not placed under the same restrictions applied by the government or the church to other workers. They were “free” to pursue their labors, “free” to travel and “free” to live their lives in a manner which befitted their importance as Craftsmen. In the England of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries this was almost a unique distinction, for most workers were under bond to the owners of the land on which they worked, but this did not apply to the Freemasons. It is said that this freedom dates back to the assembly at York in 946. The word accepted also has a special meaning and its connection with Freemasonry goes back to the days of the operative Craftsmen. During the latter years of the Middle Ages there were few educated men outside the monasteries of the church. Thus, in that day, men sought to become Freemasons, not with the idea of practicing the art, but merely to receive the “learning” and other advantages which such association brought them. These were accepted Masons rather than operative workmen. The practice of admitting non-operative members into the Craft probably originated when some of the guild companies admitted the patrons for whom they were building at the time, and the practice grew with the passage of time. With succeeding generations the operative members decreased while the accepted members increased. Somewhere in the eighteenth century the accepted Masons were predominant and the transition from oper - ative to speculative came about as a natural course of events. Is Freemasonry a Secret Society?—The answer to this question must be an unqualified NO! A secret society is one which conceals its membership, has secret meeting places, and of which the public has no knowledge either as to its organization or its aims and principles. Freemasonry, therefore, is not a secret society; but it is a society with secrets. These are few, however, and deal with certain esoteric parts of the ritual of its degrees, its obligations and modes of recog - nition. The Masonic Temple in most cities is a prominent land mark— brightly lighted at night, into which men go openly almost every ~evening in the week. Men are proud to wear its emblems and in many other ways to indicate that they are Freemasons. The purposes, ideals and principles of Freemasonry may be learned ~y anyone who inquires. There are numerous books on these subjects r MENTORS MANUAL 11 which may be obtained and read by anyone, even those who are not Masons. Public notices of Masonic meetings appear frequently in the newspapers and its members are usually numbereo among the more prominent citizens of the community. Is Freemasonry a Religion?—Heie again the answer must be an em - phatic NO! We should go one step further and say that Freemasonry is religious in its teachings. Each man who aspires to be a Free - mason is required to state that he believes and trusts in God as the Supreme Architect of the Universe. Belief in God is simply an ex - pressioii of faith, not a theological statement of the nature of Deity. Freemasonry does not require church membership before a person may petition for admission. That choice belongs to the individual, but most active Masons are also active churchmen. Our Fraternity has never been a part of any organized religious sect or church. The choice of creed and church belongs to the individual and Freemasonry does not infringe his religious prerogatives. It has no religious dogma and is based upon tolerance, seeking only to unite men under the common banner of brotherhood. No Mason should attempt to substitute the teachings of our Order or membership in a Lodge for his church. As a thinking man he has a right to belong to or refuse membership in an established church. He who seeks to substitute Freemasonry for religion knows little, if anything, about either of them. Can a Catholic Become A Mason?—There is nothing in any of the Masonic doctrines, rules or regulations, or the laws of our Grand Lodge which would prevent a Catholic from becoming a Mason be - cause of his church membership. If such were the case, Freemasonry could make no claim to universality, nor could it state that it did not espouse any theological doctrine or dogma if it made any distinction between men because of their religious beliefs. Ho dcver, the relationship between Freemasonry and the Roman ~atholic Church is greatly misunderstood by many Masons as well a most of the general public. This misunderstanding has led to many false conclusions and created barriers where none exist, so far as Freemasonry is concerned. It is a historical fact that a number of Catholic Popes have regarded Masonry with disfavor and caused Papal Bulls to be issued which condemned Freemasonry and prohibited membership in it to all Catholics. Perhaps the most famous of tbese edicts is that issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1884, known as the letter, Humanum Genus, de - nouncing both Freemasonry and the spirit of the age."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"12 MENTORS MANUAL Many prominent Catholics have been Masons in spite of these edicts. Masonry generally has given no official recognition to these many evidences of papal disfavor. It has chosen to follow its own admoni - tion of “silence and circumspection” since Pope Clement XII issued the first of these edicts in 1738. No Atheist Can Become a Mason.—A fundamental landmark of Free - masonry is a belief in God. An expression of this belief is required as a prerequisite for admission into our Lodges. The atheist denies even the existence of God and has no belief in a Supreme Being by any other name. For this reason as well as others, Freemasonry de - nies its rights and privileges to the atheist. Since Communism denies the very existence of God, this landmark would serve to bar those who subscribe to and believe in this philosophy from becoming Freemasons. Mistakenly, Communism is often re - garded as a political movement rather than what it is—a philosophy of atheistic materialism. Its believers have imposed their ruthless will on many countries today. Subjects Not Proper for Discussion in Lodges.—Freemasonry is not a negative organization but there are a few subjects which may not be discussed in a Masonic Lodge. These generally concern religions, nations and politics. There are excellent reasons for such prohibition and these will be explained. When Masons meet together within the portals of the Lodge they ~are always on a common level without the distinctions of class or wealth which are regarded so highly in the world. Each brother is entitled to his own beliefs and each may follow his own convictions as these are dictated by his conscience. In a Masonic Lodge each stands before his Creator as a man, unbolstered by wealth, class or position. The objective of Freemasonry is to unite men rather than divide them. The subjects which are not to be discussed are those on which honest differences of opinion might well create friction between brethren who are otherwise favorably disposed to each other. There is often a difference of opinion and warm debate concerning those things which are a part of the Lodge’s business. Such discus - sions are wholesome as long as they are kept within the bounds of propriety and there is an exhibition of tolerance for the opinions of others. Each Master desires to have harmony in his Lodge and when a matter has been decided by vote, that decision must be accepted by every member regardless of how he voted. There are, of course, ~certain instances in which a legal appeal may be taken. r MENTORS MANUAL 13 Freemasonry and Politics.—Politics is one of the forbidden areas of discussion in our Masonic Lodges. Therefore, Freemasons, acting as such, do not participate in partisan politics. Nor does a Lodge or the Fraternity as a whole take any part in politics. This is one of those areas in which honest differences of opinion could disrupt the peace and harmony of any Lodge. One of Freemasonry’s basic con - cepts is to unite men; political differences of opinion could easily spoil this objective. The teachings of Freemasonry urge each man to be a good citizen and to perform his civic duties. Nothing should keep any Mason from expressing his opinion or from serving his city, county, state or nation in every honorable manner. Participation in politics as in - dividual citizens is a right which belongs to every man. However, he must not act politically as a Freemason or in the name of Freemasonry in exercising his individual right. Many of our civic leaders of today and in the past have been members of the Craft and proud to support its endeavors. Qualifications of a Petitioner.—To petition a Masonic Lodge for the degrees and eventual mcmbership, the petitioner must have certain essential qualifications. First, he must believ,.~ in God. Each petition form in Virginia contains these words, The subscriber . . . begs leave to state that he believes and trusts in God as the Supreme Architect and Governor of the Universe . . . and the petitioner affixes his sig - nature to this declaration. Second, he must be of legal or lawful age, which in Virginia is twenty.one elapsed years after birth. Third, he must be able 10 perform his part in the ceremonies Fourth, he must be able to read and write, for the petition must be completed in his own hand - writing. Fifth, he must be of good moral character, under the tongue of good report, recommended and vouched for by at least two Master Masons, preferably members of the Lodge which he petitions. Membership Solicitation Prohibited.—Coarcion is a word unknown in the parlance of Freemasonry and every act which a brother performs as a Mason or in the name of Masonry is done of his ow~m volition. Thus, he first becomes a petitioner of “his own free will and accord,” without pressure from any person or group. The petition which he signs contains a statement that, unbiased by friends and uninfluenced by mercenary motwes he offers himself a candidate for the mysteries of Masonry. This is his first act toward becoming a Mason, freely and voluntarily taken. As he advances in Masonry he will find this freedom of action and thought brought again and again to the fore. front of his thinking until it becomes a cherished privilege."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"14 MENTORS MANUAL Freemasonry has prospered and grown through the voluntary acts and the way of life which is exemplified by its members. Thus the personal life of every brother and the acts he performs of his own free will become a silent but most effective exemplification of Free - masonry in the world in which he lives. Through the influence of these lives, silent and unspoken, other good men are attracted to our standard. The success of this silent witnessing is attested by the steady growth of the Fraternity through the centuries. Why Is It Called Blue Lodge?—The term Blue Lodge is quite com - monly used to refer to Craft Masonry, but the correct name is the Symbolic Lodge. Where, when or why the name Blue Lodge originated is not known. Rowever, there have been many explanations written for this term. Blue is generally regarded as the color of truth and fidelity. These are the basic teachings of our Craft. Blue is the color used to charac - terize friendship, one of the jewels of a Mason. Blue has been used to trim and ornament Masonic aprons, collars and clothing; thus these symbolic and practical uses of that color may account for the name. Others have found some symbolism in the blue arch of the heavens and have urged that for a Freemason the virtues of friendship and benevolence must be as expansive as the heavens. These are all suppositions and symbols with beautiful meanings, but let us re - member that the correct name is Symbolic Lodge, despite the fact that blue as a color and a symbol is prominent in our teachings. Preparation for Initiation.—To receive the greatest benefit from the Degree of Entered Apprentice the candidate should be urged to pre - pare his mind for its reception. Each one who seeks to be initiated should strive to attain serenity of mind and humility of spirit He should divest his thoughts of any apprehensions, entering the Lodge with a mental attitude which will enable him to appreciate the serious and solemn ceremonies through which he will pass. Encourage him to remember that Freemasonry regards every man as a child of God with a dignity and purpose given him by his Creator, of which no man should seek to divest him. He should be cautioned to pay strict attention to every part of the ceremony in order that he may gain some understanding of the teachings of Freemasonry. The methods which Freemasonry uses to teach will be new and un - usual, its truths being imparted since ancient times by allegory and symbolism. The fact that this method has been effective for more than two centuries should be explained to the candidate in order to r MENTORS MANUAL 15 make the lessons more impressive as he progresses through the de - grees. He should also learn that every Mason in the Lodge room is his friend and each, in time, will become his brother. Hazing in the Symbolic Lodge.—There is no place in our ceremonies for horseplay or hazing, and there is none. The ritual of Freemasonry is serious and solemn, inculcating spiritual lessons with great dignity. Every part of its ceremonies serves but to emphasize the truth it would teach. Anything which is told the candidate, in a joking manner or other - wise, which contradicts the foregoing statements, serves only to dese - crate the honorable purposes of Freemasonry. The candidate should be often reminded that he need have no apprehension concerning his reception within the Lodge, for he is entering a society of friends and brothers in which he will be treated wtth dignity and decorum at all times. The Heart of the Masonic Family.—Freemasonry is not just another fraternity or association of men banded together for social, political or economic advantage. It does inculcate friendship and brotherly love as the foundation stones of its philosophy, but it is also a prac - tical association which makcs many worthwhile contributions to our society in this twentieth century. Most of the Grand Lodges in the United States operate Masonic Homes for the care of orphans, the aged brother, his wife or his widow. Some of them also operate hospitals and provide nursing care for those who need the arm of brotherly love about their shoulders in their twilight years. The Grand Lodges which do not operate homes have assistance programs to serve the same ends. That which is offered by the Grand Lodges is done on a selective basis; member - ship in the fraternity does not confer a vested right on anyone to receive such care in his latter years. The Masonic family is proud of the contributions made by the appendant bodies and orders which are composed entirely of Masons. Perhaps the largest and best known contribution is that made by the Shrine Hospitals for Crippled Children. Nineteen units and three burns centers, located all over the United States, Canada, Hawaii and Mexico minister to the needs of crippled children, regardless of racial, religious or fraternal background, whose families cannot pay for the surgical care need - ed to make them whole again and enable them to become useful citizens. The Knights Templar Eye Foundation works unceasingly to combat the loss of sight. It supplies funds for surgical treatment as well as for glasses to those who cannot pay for these necessities, without V"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"16 MENTORS MANUAL MENTORS MANUAL L7 regard to race, religion or fraternal background. The Foundation is also making grants to various hospitals for the continuing study of diseases of the eye and for the purchase of modern equipment to serve this field. Darkness also comes to the mind. The Scottish Rite, Northern Masonic Jurisdiction, has conducted a program of research in schizo - phrenia since 1935. Helped by its contributions, both financially and technical, the treatment of this disease of the mind has greatly ad - vanced in the last quarter century. Medical science also receives help and encouragement in the fields of cancer research and muscular distrophy from the Grotto and in that of muscular distrophy from the Tall Cedars of Lebanon, two other groups composed entirely of Masons. In the field of education the Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, has endowed a chair in the School of Government at George Washing - ton University at Washington, D. C. Most of the State Scottish Rite groups have fellowships which are awarded to graduate students wishing to attend this school of government who are deemed worthy. The Grand Commandery, Knights Templar, has an Educational Foun - dation which loans funds to worthy students, thus enabling them to complete their final two years in college. This program has also been in operation for many years and has been very successful. Space does not permit the further expansion of this subject. At - tention is invited to the fine visitation program conducted by the Masonic Service Association in Veterans Hospitals all over the United States. The dedicated brethren serving in this field have enabled Masonry to light another candle on the altars of brotherly love. Chapter III Degree of Entered Apprentice The candidate has now received the first degree in Masonry and has thereby opened the door to another area of education and in - spiration which marks the first step in his Masonic indoctrination and progress. He should have impressed on his mind the three qualities which each Entered Apprentice must possess if he is to attain full benefit and enjoyment of Freemasonry. These are Obedience, Hu - miUty, and Indiestriousness. He must obey those who are appointed to teach him if he would learn what is required of him before he progresses further. He must have a sense of humility so that he will not develop a belief that he knows more than those who are as - signed to teach him. He must also develop a spirit of indu8try, for Freemasonry requires those who would know her treasures to labor for them. Responsibility for Instruction.—The full responsibility for the proper instruction of the candidate rests upon the Worshipful Master of the Lodge. Under our present plan for Masonic instruction two instruc - tors should be appointed by him; one to teach the ritualistic catechisms and the other to serve the candidate as his Mentor, providing him with the other aspects of his Masonic instruction. The Mentor should endeavor to be his friendly advisor during the entire period in which he is receiving his degrees and until he has mastered those funda - mentals of Craft Masonry so that he is prepared to pursue his study of any and all of the facets of Masonry which are of interest to him. It should be understood that the duties of the Mentor are not com - pleted when the candidate receives the Degree of Master Mason, nor when he has been examined and declared proficient on that degree. Indoctrination must continue until the new Mason is thoroughly oriented in the Lodge, interested in its affairs and a habitual attend - ant at its communications. Then, and only then, can we say that the task is completed which the Mentor began at the time of the candi - date’s election to receive the First Degree. Reports of the candidate’s progress should be made to the Worship - ful Master in order that he may schedule the next degree as soon as the new ~brother is prepared to receive it. One of our objectives should be that of keeping the enthusiasm of the candidate at the highest level, giving him degrees and instruction as rapidly as he can receive and appreciate both. Must be First Prepared in His Heart.—As a man thinketh so is he; but as he purposes in his heart so will his life be. The heart, figura -"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"18 MENTORS MANUAL tively speaking, is the seat of man’s affections and desires. If he is clean within, his life will reflect that condition; but the reverse is also true. Freemasonry is concerned with the building of character in the life of the individual. That building must begin in the heart, for if it is not properly receptive, we can expect to make little impression on the mind. Hence each who comes seeking light must first be pre - pared in his heart. Duly and Truly Prepared.—The wearing of special garments which are furnished by the Lodge is done in order to emphasize our concern with man’s internal qualities rather than his worldly wealth and honors. By wearing the garments of humility the candidate signifies the sincerity of his intentions. It is necessary that he be prepared thus in order that the symbolic meaning of all which transpires both at the West Gate and in the Lodge room itself may be presented anew to him each time he is prepared and on every occasion when he sees another candidate enter the West Gate. Symbolism, a Means of Teaching.—Most of the great lessons of Free - masonry are imparted by symbols wiscly selected by our Masonic f ore- fathers for that purpose. In the preparation of the candidate there are certain symbols which he may not recognize or appreciate because these are mentioned but briefly in the lecture. These are in part: The Hoodwink is a symbol of darkness in which the uninitiated dwells. It is also a symbol of secrecy and is practiced for spiritual rather than physical reasons. The darkness of the hoodwink is dis - placed by the light of understanding when the candidate penetrates the mysteries before him. The Cable-tow is a symbol of those external restraints which must be placed upon the life of man. It is also generally regarded to mean the scope of one’s ability to perform his obligations to his brethren. Entrance: the ritualistic ceremony covered by this term includes all which transpires at the West Gate and is intended to teach the significance of initiation as the symbolic birth of the candidate into the world of Masonry in which he can give and receive as he wishes, deriving pleasure and satisfaction, or discontent and unhappiness as he may choose. The Reception of the candidate within the Lodge room is intended to symbolize the fact that the obligations which he will assume are solemn and that there is a penalty if these are violated. It also re— r MENTORS MANUAL 19 minds man that his every act has a consequence, either in the form of a reward or a penalty. Man reapeth as he soweth. Lodge of the Holy Saints John at Jerusalem—Freemasonry long ago chose as its patron saints John the Baptist and John the Evange - list. Having done so, the brethren arrived at the conclusion that their patron saints belonged to a Lodge and that it must have been in the city in which they lived—Jerusalem. By this tradition all Lodges came from the one at Jerusalem. By tradition also every Mason hails from such a Lodge. By coming from this mythical Lodge he proves that he hails from a “just and legally constituted Lodge.” The For-rn of a Lodge.—The form of a Lodge is an oblong square, or a rectangle. It extends from East to West and between North and South. The East in a Masonic Lodge does not necessarily mean the actual point of the compass. The East in the Lodge is the station of the Worshipful Master from which he dispenses light and instruc - tion to all his brethren. The other points, West, South and North, are located in proper relation to the station of the Master. The Rite of Circumambulation.—The word circumambulate means to walk around some central point or object. In Masonry the rite is performed in a clockwise manner, patterned after the movement of the sun as it is seen from the earth moving from East to West by way of the South. The candidate’s journey around the altar enables the brethren to observe that he is properly prepared. Circumambulation is much older than initiation, even into the Ancient Mysteries, for it goes back to savage man who worshipped the sun and reproduced its light and heat with fire on his own crude stone altars, around which he marched in humble adoration and worshipful imitation of the journey of the sun across the sky. Circumambulation should teach the apprentice that Freemasonry is a progressive science and by means of it man may gather truth as he progresses. It also teaches that life is a progressive journey through which each must travel toward his ultimate destiny. The Altar.—This is the central piece of furniture in the Lodge and upon it rest the three Great Lights in Masonry. It is symbolic of many things. Its location in the Lodge symbolizes the place which God has in Masonry and which he should have in every human life. It is also a symbol of worship and faith. The candidate approaches the altar in search of light and there assumes his obligations. Here, in the presence of God and his brethren, he offers himself to the service of the Supreme Architect of the Universe and to mankind in general. K"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"20 MENTORS MANUAL The altar is the point on which life in our Masonic Lodges is focused. The precepts for which the Great Lights stand should serve to guide the thoughts and actions of the brethren both in the Lodge and abroad in the world. The altar supporting the Great Light should remind each brother who stands before it that faith supports life itself. The Worshipful Master.— (a) Why is the presiding officer of the Lodge called Worshipful? This is an old English word meaning worthy of respect. Thus it comes to us in Masonry as a title of respect given to the officer who rules and governs the Lodge. Since he is chosen by the brethren, they deem him to have sufficient wisdom, integrity and Masonic knowledge to govern the Lodge properly. (b) Why is the Worshipful Master’s station in the East? In the world of nature the sun rises in the East to shed light and luster on the earth. In like manner it is the province of the Master to be the source of Masonic knowledge for his brethren and they “approach the East in search of light.” (c) Why does the Master wear a hat in the Lodge? The Worshipful Master usually wears a hat while the rest of the brethren remain uncovered for several reasons. Keeping the head covered while others are uncovered has long been a symbol of superior rank. Men usually uncover in the presence of those they deem to be of superior rank as a mark of respect. The wearing of the hat by the Worshipful Master may be done because King Solomon wore a crown as a mark of dignity. For these reasons and others, the Master of a Masonic Lodge usually wears a hat in the East. The Great bights of Freemasonry.—The Great Light of Free - masonry is the Volume of the Sacred Law and it is an indispensable part of the furniture of a Lodge. The Grand Lodges of the United States use the Holy Bible as the V.S.L on their altars, but the can - didate who is not a Christian or Jew is entitled to have his own sacred book substituted for the Bible. In some Lodges in other coun - tries the altars of Masonry have more than one Volume of the Sacred Law on them and the candidate may choose the one on which he is obligated. No Lodge may stand open unless the Holy Bible is opened upon its altar, its pages displaying the proper passage appropriate to the degree in which the Lodge is working. The open Bible signifies that by the light of its teachings we must regulate our conduct, for it is the rule and guide of our faith. The Square and Compasses have ritualistic explanations which should suffice for the candidate. The Square is a symbol of morality, r MENTORS MANUAL 21 truthfulness and honesty. To “act on the square” is to act honestly. The Compasses are a symbol of restraint, of skill and of knowledge. The Square and Compasses are almost universally recognized as the out - standing symbol of Freemasonry itself. The Obligation.—The obligation is the heart of the degree, for when it is assumed by the candidate, he has solemnly bound himself to Freemasonry and assumed certain duties which are his for the rest of his life. The taking of the obligation is a visible and audible evidence of the candidate’s sincerity of purpose. By it he gives mean - ing to all the other parts of the degree which have gone before as well as that which comes after. The obligation has a two-fold purpose. In addition to binding the candidate to Freemasonry and its duties, it also protects the Fra - ternity against the revelation of its secrets as these deal with its modes of recognition and symbolic instruction. The candidate should undersiand that the great truths which Masonry teaches are not secret, but the manner in which Freemasonry teaches these comes in this category. Penalties for Violation of Obligation.—The penalties incurred for willful violation of your Masonic obligation will nol be of a physical nature. Those which you recite at the conclusion of your obligation in the Lodge room are purely symbolic. However, the Mason who violates his obligation will subject himself to Masonic discipline which could include the loss of his membership in the Lodge and the Frater - nity, either by suspension or expulsion therefrom. Assuredly the violator will also be subject to the scorn and contempt of all good Masons. The ancient oral penalties already mentioned are retained in our ritual to impress upon the mind of each brother how serious a vio - lation will be regarded by the members of the Fraternity. These were assumed voluntarily, and every means possible is used to impress the new Mason with the solemnity and the necessity for faithful performance of them. The Rite of Salutation.—The Rite of Salutation as practiced in our Lodges requires each initiate to salute the Wardens of the Lodge in their stations. This is done to teach him to recognize the authority vested in the principal officers of the Lodge and thus the salute becomes a symbol of the brother’s respect for all duly constituted Masonic authority as represented by the chief officers of the Lodge in which he is initiated. The new brother will observe that the due guard and sign are both"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"MENTORS MANUAL 23 22 MENTORS MANUAL employed in this particular ceremony, but at other times the due guard is most often used in our Virginia Lodges. Other Grand Lodges have different customs, some requiring the due guard and sign, while others use only the sign or penal sign, as it is often denominated. The due guard is used to remind each of his obligation and so to serve as a continuing pledge for the faithful performance thereof. It is also used as a form of salutation to the Worshipful Master when entering the Lodge or when rising to speak. The Masonic Aprun.—The apron is an ancient appendage and it has taken many forms among the various crafts of the world. Though we associate it chiefly with Freemasonry, its use was not confined to the operative stonemason. The apprentice stoneman wore his apron with a bib held in place by a strap around his neck. This pro - tected his clothing from damage by the large rough stones which he handled. The apron was also worn by certain officers of the Church of Eng - land as a badge of servitude and, this use of the time-honored badge of a Mason by the church may have affected some of our symbolism. The Mason, by wearing the apron, may be testifying to his under - standing of the service which Freemasonry would have us render to our fellow-men. The badge also signifies that Freemasons are work - ers rather than drones; builders rather than obstructionists. Both the symbolic material—lambskin—and the color of the apron —white—make it an emblem of innocence and purity. In the words used to present the apron it is described as being “more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle, more honorable than the Star and Garter . . .“ These are the honored decorations of ancient Rome and Medieval Europe and the apron is held up as an ennobling deco - ration conferred only on the selected who come into our Craft. The Rite of Destitution.—This rite is also ancient and was practiced in the older initiations in recognition of a belief that the planets had an affinity for certain metals. These planets also exerted certain in - fluences over human beings. In the ancient ceremonies of initiation all metals were left behind so that disturbing planetary influences were not brought within the place where the initiated met. In Freemasonry this ancient rite is still used to teach the initiate that he is to bring nothing into the Lodge which would destroy its peace and harmony. As he is divested of worldly reminders, leaving them without the Lodge, so he is reminded that he must lease his pas - sions and prejudices without when he enters its portals. Another great lesson, that of relieving another brother’s distress, is taught by means of this ancient rite. The Northeast Corner.—This is the traditional location of the corner - stone or foundation stone as it was more appropriately denominated by our ancient brethren. Both the stone and its location would signify a beginning. The Entered Apprentice is placed at this point midway between the darkness of the North and the brilliance of the East to signify that he has begun his Masonic life. He has left the darkness of the North, symbolizing ignorance of things Masonic, and is moving toward the light of knowledge which comes from the East. The Entered Apprentice has laid the foundation stone of his Masonic life and must now erect the edifice of character in the light of the teach - ings which come from the East. The Working Tools.—The working tools presented the candidates are those used by the ancient operative craftsman in the erection of the building on which he was working. To the Speculative Mason these represent the moral habits and forces by which man shapes and frequently reshapes the materials of his human nature, often a stsbborn and difficult task. By these symbolic tools he also fits his own behavior to the society in which he dwells. The working tools themselves are appropriately explained in the ritualistic ceremonies. The Charge.—At the end of the ritualistic ceremony of initiation and instruction the candidate is charged to perform his Masonic duties; the substance of that charge is a summation of them. There are a number of documents known to Masonic students as the Old or Ancient Charges of a Freemason. In these were found the fundamental principles of ancient Masonic law and usage, both written and unwritten. These were compiled from the original records of Freemasonry by a Committee of brethren of the Grand Lodge of England and written by James Anderson, George Payne and John T. Desaguliers at various times during the second decade of the 18th century. These are often referred to as the Constitutions of 1723 and are printed in the front of our Virginia Methodical Digest. In these are to be found the excellent rules and maxims laid down for the conduct of the individual Mason as well as of the Lodge of which he is a part. Since these are printed, it should be our purpose to recommend a stsdy of them by the new brother at an appropriate time. The Lecture.—The lecture attached to the Degree is intended to elabo - rate certain phases of the ritual, giving a broader explanation of it in order that the candidate may understand both the ceremony and purpose behind the inclusion of each in the ritual. In this portion he will have explained to him in greater detail some of the symbolism with which Freemasonry is embellished."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"24 MENTORS MANUAL MENTORS MANUAL 25 The frequent references to King Solomon’s temple in this and the other degrees lend to the false conclusion that the Fraternity was founded by him. Freemasonry as an organized Craft came into being many centuries after the reign of Israel’s greatest king. However, our ritual is based upon Masonic legends connected with both Solomon and the Temple at Jerusalem and this subject has enriched its symbolism. The Catechisms.—This series of questions and answers is intended to teach each initiate the language of Freemasonry, to fix in his mind the teachings of the degree, to impress upon his consciousness the facets of the obligation he has assumed, and to enable him to prove to his satisfaction and that of his brethren that he is a Mason. To each candidate’s mind there probably comes the question as to the necessity for committing the catechism to memory. 1~4uch of our ritual is esoteric or unwritten and each is required to memorize the language with some degree of perfection, since each is a potential teacher of other new brethren and through each man numbered among its votaries Freemasonry seeks to transmit its truth pure and unim - paired from generation to generation. The Origin of Our Ritual.—The origin of our Ritual cannot be traced much beyond the years of the 18th century. The father of the English Ritual was undoubtedly William Preston (1742-1818), who left an indelible imps-mt upon Freemasonry that is still apparent today. However, it must be remembered that the ritual now used has been refined and polished without being basically changed in character in the nearly two centuries since Preston first exemplified his rituals in London. Prior to Preston’s time the ritual of Freemasonry was a perpetuation of the practices and customs of the day-to-day work of the Operative Freemason which gradually had the emphasis shifted from the practical to the moral and spiritual values as the Accepted Masons began to outnumber the Operative Brethren in the Lodges. It is well for us to remember that the ritual, as such, was not designed as a series of ceremonies; rather it was an education in mathematics and the liberal arts and this idea was Preston’s central theme. In early Speculative Masonry there may have been but one degree and a Master’s part. After a few years three degrees emerged and began to be generally practiced. In later years others may have been added until the United Grand Lodge of England declared (sometime after 1813) that ‘Ancient Craft Masonry consists of three degrees and no more . . .“ but a fourth, the Royal Arch, was included as a part of the Master Mason Degree which was intended to be available to those who had served in the chair as Master of the Lodge. The Royal Arch is no longer considered a part of Craft Masonry but is conferred in a Chapter of Royal Arch Masons as the final degree of the Capitular System. The Language of Freemasonry.—Why is the language of Freemasonry so different from that which we normally use? This question arises in the minds of many men as hey study the catechisms and hear the rituals of Masonry given in our Lodges. As has been noted, the Ritual of Freemasonry is a product of the early decades of the 18th century. It contains much of the langnage of that century and into it have been incorporated words and phrases which come from the older instructions which were a part of Operative Masonry in a much earlier day. If the time and effort is expended to study the words of our Ritual, the student will discover that the thought and teaching imparted can - not be clothed in fewer words and still retain their meaning. The phrases serve to hold the attention of the new brother, and though the rituals were re-written by Preston and others, these peculiar words and phrases have survived to become an integral part of our Free - masonry, which may not now be changed without creating an innova - tion in the body of Masonry itself, thereby violating one of the ancient charges read to every Worshipful Master for his assent when he is seated in the East. Masonic Emblems.—The Entered Apprentice should study all of the emblems of the degree for each is important and should be thoroughly understood by him. An emblem is, of course, the visible representa - tion of an idea. For eKample, the lamb is usually an emblem of in - nocence. In Masonry the emblem carries with it an allegorical sig - nificance and suggests some truth to the mind. The twenty-four inch gauge is an emblem of the twenty-four hours of each day. The way in which time should be used by the Freemason is called to mind by this simple instrument of the stonemason. The emblems of the degree and each of the symbols which are used to purvey the wise and beautiful lessons should be explained to the new brother. The Mentor should also endeavor to make him under - stand that Masons-y teaches largely by symbols and a thorough un - derstanding of them will enable him to grasp the meaning of its truths. When To Arise and When To Be Seated in Lodge.—The gavel in the hands of the Master of a Lodge is one of the symbols of authority by which he governs. When the gavel is sounded once in the East, the brethren must come to order; two raps call the officers of the Lodge to their feet; when three raps are given, all of the brethren must stand. Thereafter one rap of the Master’s gavel seats the Lodge."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"p..’—— a MENTORS MANUAL 27 26 MENTORS MANUAL The Responsibilities of An Entered Apprentice.—The particular re - sponsibilities of an Entered Apprentice are relatively few. To keep If the Worshipful Master addresses you by name, arise, face the inviolable the secrets entrusted to him, to conduct himself with proper East and listen to his instructions. The brother wishing to speak decorum, and to seek the light of Masonic knowledge with diligence rises and makes the due guard, waits until the Master recognizes will probably cover all of the specific duties of the new Mason. him and then addresses his remarks to him. The Tiler.—The Tiler (spelled Tyler in some Grand Lodges) is the guardian of the avenues approaching the Lodge. A. Lodge is said to be ditty tiled when the necessary precautions have been taken to guard against intrusion by cou’ans, eavesdroppers or other un - authorized persons. Each brother permitted to enter the Lodge after It is opened is vouched for by the Tiler as qualified to enter. Among his duties the Tiler informs the Junior Deacon when a quali - fled brother wishes to enter the Lodge. He also ascertains that each one who seeks to enter is properly clothed and informs them of the degree in which the Lodge is then working. In many Lodges this officer is also the custodian of its property and prepares the Lodge before it is opened. Lodge Prayer.—No Lodge can be opened or stand open without prayer which is offered by the Chaplain or, in his absence, by the Master himself. The prayers used for this purpose are a part of the ritual in Virginia, and these must be used to the exclusion of all others to avoid offense or sectarianism in the Lodge. At the conclusion of the prescribed prayer each member responds with the words, So Mote It Be, thus adopting the words of the prayer as his own. This expression is from an older form of the English language and may be properly translated, So May It Ever Be. The Rights of an Entered Apprentice.—These are very limited since he is not required to pay dues and cannot vote or hold office. In Operative Masonry the Apprentice was not considered a part of the Masonic Craft even though he was entered upon the books of the Lodge. The Entered Apprentice of modern Masonry is not entitled to organized Masonic charity, but this does not bar him from receiv - ing assistance from a Mason as an individual. He is not entitled to receive a Masonic burial nor can he attend the funeral of a brother clothed as a Mason. The Entered Apprentice may attend a Lodge on the First Degree of Masonry if he is properly vouched for by a Master Mason. He is entitled to be instructed and has the right to demonstrate his pro. ficiency before being advanced to the degree of Fellow Craft. He may not receive the other Degrees of Craft Masonry elsewhere without the consent of his Lodge. Such conferral of the degrees may be re - quested if he removes from the jurisdiction of the Lodge in which he was elected to receive the Entered Apprentice Degree."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"28 MENTORS MANUAL Chapter IV Degree of Fellow Craft The Degree of Fellow Craft emphasizes the dignity and worth of the individual. It represents man as an instrument of the Supreme Architect of the Universe. As such he is a workman whose duty it is to invent, create and achieve, and thus to express his own genius and individuality. The cornerstone of our democracy is its belief in this same principle. All of its institstions are designed to encourage the development of individual genius and to allow man to become as great as he wills and labors to be. The ruling principle of our form of government is that the State must not interfere with the indi - vidual’s freedom to any greater extent than is necessary to preserve the existence of that society in which individual freedom can flourish. The Degree of Fellow Craft symbolizes man in the prime years of his life, an adult who is ready to accept the responsibilities of life, not only for himself but for his family and the enlarged circle which is his world. As the Mason assumes the duties and privileges of a Fellow Craft, he is brought face to face with the many important lessons which are taught in the degree, not the least of which is that of responsibility f or his own destiny and that of the State as well. The Degree teaches much of what was considered essential knowl - edge by Preston, who envisioned Masonry as a liberal education and fashioned the ritual along these lines. Its themes are, therefore, education and achievement. As man labors in pursuit of knowledge, so does he obtain entrance into parts of life and society which were hitherto unknown to him. As with the Degree of Entered Apprentice, the Degree of Fellow Craft is not to be regarded as a stepping-stone to the Degree of Master Mason. Its lessons are a vital part of our Freemasonry; one part of its teaching is imparted to the Entered Apprentice, another to the Fellow Craft; but each is an important and complete lesson in which no subordination of Masonry is to be found. The candidate should keep before him at all times the fact that Freemasonry is too extensive to be exemplified in the ritual which enables him to receive the Degree in one evening. Meaning of the Term Fellow Craft.—This term is one of a large number which have technical meanings peculiar to Freemasonry. Originally the Entered Apprentice was not considered to be a part of the Masonic Craft, even though he was entered upon the books of the Lodge. It was not until he had passed his apprenticeship and had been accepted as a Fellow that he was considered to be a Crafts- MENTORS MANUAL 29 man. The Craft was an organization of skilled workmen and the Entered Apprentice lacked the skill to qualify. The Fellow, on the other hand, was one who was obligated to the duties of membership and entitled to its privileges. The Denominations of Masonry.—The Ritual informs us that these are the Operative and the Speculative. The Operative Craft was the immediate predecessor of the modern or Speculative Masonry. Oper - ative Masonry existed through many centuries of man’s development. In Masonic history the Operative denomination is considered to be that period of time prior to the 18th century when the members were the operative stonemasons and architects engaged in the construction of public and private buildings. They were the most skilled artisans of their time and the products of their labor may be seen in the great cathedrals and castles of both England and the European Continent. Speculative Freemasonry is the child of the Operative Art, de - veloped during those latter years of its history when the great build - ings were nearly completed. The Freemasonry which owes its alle - giance to the Grand Lodge system came into being in 1717 when the Grand Lodge of England was formed. The working tools of the operative craftsman are used by the Fraternity today as symbolic instruments for the erection of those stately mansions of human character. In the hands of the Speculative Craftsman these working tools have become the purveyors of moral and spiritual lessons to the men who come to its altars in search of light. Thus has Free - masonry become a system of ethics, philosophy and a way of life for its votaries. The Evolution From Operative to Speeulative.—Here again we are dealing with an illusive event, for we cannot reach into the years and point to a single day as that in which the operative art became the Speculative Science. The change was gradual and probably stretched over a period of more than half-a-century. It began early in the 17th century and the change was still in progress in the first years of the 18th century. It may have begun with the acceptance of patrons into the operative lodges. Others followed them in seeking membership who were not interested in becoming stonemasons. Those who were admitted by the consent of the operative masons became accepted Masons. Because of the moral and ethical values stressed in the training given an operative apprentice, the “speculatives” of the 17th century saw an established and honorable vehicle for their own use. Membership was sought for the spiritual, social and culturaL advantages offered and the number of accepted Masons grew rapidly. F The decline of Gothic architecture and the lessened demands for"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"30 MENTORS MANUAL great building projects had greatly reduced the number of skilled operative craftsmen needed to carry on the construction under way at the time. The end of an era was at hand and the operative craft was faced with extinction. During this same period, however, interest in Speculative Masonry had grown and the number of accepted Masons in the older operative lodges had increased. Instead of passing into oblivion as did so many of the institutions of the day, the Craft became predominantly specu - lative, and its growth and strength has progressed to a point never envisioned by its founders. Much of this growth may be attributed to the formation of the Grand Lodge of England at the meeting of the four old Ledges in Londcm in the Goose and Gridiron Tavern in 1717, at which Anthony Sayer, gentleman, was elected Grand Master. Its Provincial Grand Lodges spread over much of the world and some of these eventually became Grand Lodges in their own right. Thus over a period of time was the evolution begun and the transition completed. The Basic Teachings of the Second Degree.—Based on Masonic symbol - ism, the Fellow Craft Degree covers the years of manhood and re - sponsibility in the cycle of human life. In it man finds opportunities to obtain useful knowledge and the means of applying that knowledge to the building of his character and the betterment of the society in which he lives. At the outset the discerning mind sees the Divine Plan and finds its own function and place in it. The new brother also discovers two great themes developed in the degree—education and achievement. The father of our Masonic rituals, William Preston (1742-1818), .conceived Masonry to be the vehicle by which man might become well educated in the liberal arts and sciences. In the ritual of the Degree the Fellow Craft is urged to advance his education in these fields. The opportunities of today have placed all of the facts of this part of the degree at the command of the average school-boy. To unlock the door of symbolic interpretation of these liberal arts and sciences, man must use the key of initiation. The Preparation.—A s in the Degree of Entered Apprentice special garments are worn as the clothing of humility to teach anew the concern which Masonry has for the internal qualities of the man. There are certain significant changes which are made in the dress of the candidate and the symbolism of these is fully explained in the ritual of the Degree. The candidate gains admission much in the same manner as in the preceding Degree, but this is accomplished by the exchange of a MENTORS MANUAL 31 certain pass given for him by his conductor. Thus the observing Craftsman learns that brethren give willingly of their knowledge and energy that he may gain the privileges of Freemasonry. All of life is lived with the assistance of others, and this ceremony brings to mind the great truth of fraternal assistance which is ours in the time of need. The Reception.—The reception, which includes all of the ceremonies at the West Gate, follows somewhat the same pattern as before, with certain exceptions. The instrument used in this ceremony is one which refers to virtue and urges its application to human life. The consequences of his acts and the solemnity of his obligations are impressed on the mind by these ceremonies. The Cahle-tow.——The cable-tow is a symbol of the method of control for the individual. The cable, cord or bond is interwoven in countless religious ceremonies and the use of a tie is as ancient as any known art in the history of mankind. To many the cable-tow is symbolic ~f the umbilical cord, which is necessary to begin life but is severed when love and care replace it in supplying those essentials needed for growth. Thus, in our ceremonies, the cable-tow is removed when the need for physical control no longer exists. The length of the cable-tow is frequently referred to in the language of Freemasonry, but many of the new brethren do not understand its meaning. Formerly the cable-tow was deemed to be the distance one could travel in an hour—assumed to be about three miles. The symbolic length of the cable-tow is the scope of a brother’s reasonable ability according to the definition made by the Baltimore Convention of 1843. This is generally accepted as the meaning of the term today Each Mason is bound to all other Masons by a tie as long and as strong as he himself determines the extent of his ability. The Obligation.—The Obligation is the heart of every Degree and its solemnity must be impressed upon every candidate. In addition to. the vow of secrecy assumed in the First Degree, which is reaffirmed in, this, the obligation has certain other salient points which binds each brother. Obedience, assistance and the protection of one another are pledged by each Mason to all others, binding them by a common tie which should last as long as life itself. The penalties have the same significance as those invoked in the First Degree. These are symbolical rather than physical for the reasons which have been cited in the First Degree. The Working Tools.—The ancient implements of the stonemason as - aume new meanings for the Fellow Craft as he hears these presented in the expressive and impressive language of the Ritual."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"r - - •- - 32 MENTORS MANUAL The Square is the symbol of morality, truthfulness and honesty. The use of the word with these implications has become almost uni - versal both within and without the Fraternity. The direction of the two members of the square form an angle of 900 or a right angle, so called because this is the angle which stones must have if they are to be used to build a stable and upright wall. When brethren part upon the square, they go in different directions but in full knowledge that their courses will be according to the angle of the square—right— until they meet again. The Level is a symbol of equality. The equality expressed here does not mean that of xvealth, social distinction, civic office or service to mankind. Masons use the term to refer to the internal and not the external qualifications. Each is endowed with a worth and dignity which is spiritual, and not subject to man-made distinctions. The equality practiced in Masonry recognizes that one man may have greater potentialities of life, service or reward than another, but denies that any man may not aspire to the heights, no matter how great. Thus the level dignifies labor and the man who performs it. It also acknowledges the equality of manhood as being an equality without regard to station. The Plumb is a symbol of uprightness of conduct. In Freemasonry it is associated with the plumb line which the Lord promised Amos He would set in the midst of his people Israel, symbolizing His standard of divine righteousness. The plumb line in the midst of a people should mean that they will be judged by their own sense of right and wrong and not by the standards of others. Freemasons, understanding the Plumb, are to judge each brother by his own stand - ards and not those of another. When the plumb line is thought of in this way, it becomes a symbol of an upright life and of the con - science by which each must live. The Jewels of a Fellow Craft.—These are named in the Ritual and need not be repeated. They remind the Craftsman that the time - tonored method of instruction is by word of mouth. The secrets of Freemasonry are always deposited in the hearts of faithful brethren. These jewels should signify the necessity to learn to utilize good Masonic instruction and develop a devotion to the teachings of our Craft. The Wages of a Fellow Craft.—Corn, wine and oil are the symbolic -wages which are earned by the Fellow Craft who completes his task and comes to the Middle Chamber. These symbolize wealth in mental and spiritual realms. The Corn represents nourishment and the zustenance of life. It is also a symbol of plenty as the term is applied MENTORS MANUAL 33 to opportunity f or doing good, work for the common weal, and service to mankind. Wine is symbolic of refreshment, of health, of spiritual - ity and of peace. The Oil represents joy and gladness as well as happiness and recognizes these as a natural sequence following the partaking of the corn of nourishment. Taken together Corn, wine and oil, the symbolic wages of a Fellow-Craft, represent the rewards of the good life. Corn, wine and oil are used as elements of conse - cration in other Masonic ceremonies of which the Fellow Craft will be informed in due time. The Pillars in the Porcli.—These are the two brazen pillars placed before the entrance to King Solomon’s Temple which are symbolically represented within every Lodge on the Second Degree of Masonry. No one can determine the origin of this practice. It existed in ancient times and the great Temple at Jerusalem was one of the many ex - amples. It has been said that the Pillars of Hercules inspired the columns thus used by the ancients, though the use of pillars or columns ante-dates their place in history. These natural rock forma - tions at Gibraltar and Cueta stand guard over the Strait of Gibraltar and mark the end of the western world as the ancients knew it. In Freemasonry these pillars bear the names Boas and Jachin and are symbols of strength and establishment, by implication, of power and control. In passing between them the Fellow Craft is not told to observe or examine one at the expense of the other. Both power and control are placed before him so that he might realize power without control is anarchy or that control without power is futility. These two pillars of strength and establishment, of power and control, sug - gest that man must have both if his life is to be successful. The Globes Surmounting the Columus.—These represent the globes celestial and terrestrial and are thus symbols of universality. The shape of these two pominels would seem to make them a modern addition to Masonic ritual, for our forebears did not conceive the earth to be a sphere. Certainly even the most learned mon of King Solomon’s day had no such conception of the earth or the heavens. They be - lieved the earth to be flat and the heavens to be a sphere revolving around it. The fiat earth and the slowly turning celestial sphere above it are as old as man’s observation of the starry-decked heavens which are referred to in the ritual. The ornamentation of these spheres on the tops of the columns may well be a corruption of the lily-work of the Old Testament, and the lily was apparently a concept of the lotus of Egypt, which for that people was a symbol of the universe."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"1 34 MENTORS MANUAL The Winding Stairs.—The Winding Stairs represent the progress of an inquiring mind with the toils and labors of intellectual cultivation and study. They teach the preparatory acquisition of all human science as a pre1in~inary step to the attainment of Divine truth. These winding stairs by their very shape are also symbols of courage rind faith. The Winding Stairs of life lead us to we know not what; for some there will be a Middle Chamber filled with the rewards of fame and fortune. For others it will be filled with frustration, pain and dis - couragement. The Angel of Death may stand on the next step for any traveler. Yet man climbs because he has faith and because he is filled with courage. He believes that the winding stairs of life lead to his destiny and that there are wages to be earned by the Fellow Craft who climbs. The wages of a Fellow Craft have been given as corn, wine and oil, but these are symbolic. His wages are truth or that approxima - tion of it which will be most appropriate for him. Thus on these Winding Stairs the discerning Craftsman learns one of the most beautiful lessons and one of the great doctrines of the science of Masonic symbolism,—that he is ever to be in search of truth, but never to find it. For the wise Ihere is also the lesson that the know] - edge of ~he nature of God and man’s re1aUon~ to Him is divine truth and can never be fully acquired in this life The Symbolism of Numbers.—The symbolism of numbers is employed extensively in the teachings of Freemasonry and it is for the first time presented to the new Mason in the Winding Stairs lecture. The theory o~ numbers as the symbols of certain qualities is supposed to have been borrowed from Pythagoras. The total number of steps is fifteen and this is a significanl symbol. Fifteen i~ a sacred number because the holy name JAil had letters which were the numerical equivalent of fifteen. Thus the total number of steps, by this symbo - lism, is symbolic of the name of God. The first three steps must teach us that we are dependent upon God and that we must harmonize our wifls with His, building our spiritual temple agreeably to the Divine plan. The second group of five steps teaches the use of order in archi - tecture as such order is applied to the individual’s spiritual tempk. They also remind the student that improvement in each life wiU come through a rational development of the natural powers given each human being. 35 MENTORS MANUAL The final seven steps symbolize the crowning glory of man—the de - veloprneflt of both the mind and the spirit—the acquisitiOn of that courage and faith which causes each possesSOr c~f those virtues to as - cend to the summit and so attain the rewards that await those who labor and faint not. These are the symbolic wages of a worthy Fellow Craft. Admission to the Middle Chamber.—The passage from the outer porch to the Middle Chamber represents man’s journey from ignorance to enlightenment. His wages as a Fellow Craft are received in the Middle Chamber and these are an approximation of Divine Truth. To attain this knowledge he must follow the ascending path which is arduous and difficuk. The initiate must also find the doors to knowi - edge—the outer and inner entranceS. To enter one of these he needs a pass; to go through the other he must have a word to use as I~he key. Help is given him in each instance, but such assistance is hmited. This signifies that man must acquire knowledge chiefly through his own effort, though he is often dependent upon others for some help. Knowledge, however, does not beLong to any man until it has become a part of him. Emphasis, therefore, should be placed upon the ex - penditure of effort by the initiate, for without this he cannot reap the reward which he seeks. The Middle Chamber.—Ifl modern FreemaSOnry the Middk Chamber is the symbolic place of reward which takes the form of the wages of a worthy brother Fellow Craft. According to some interpretatiOnS of the allegorical background of our ritual, this was the place in which the Fe~1ow Craft met to receive wages for their labors on the Temple of So~omofl. The assembly of these craftsmen took place on the evening of the sixth day of the week and those who were entitled to the wages of a Feflow Craft were invested with certain mysterious signs, tokens and a word which enabled them to pass the inner and outer guards and to enter the Middle Chamber. To achieve the Middle Chamber as a place means but little. The rewards found there must be stressed, for each act done by man brings to him either reward or punishment. King Solomon’s Temple.—The ritualistic references to the great Temple at JerusaLem are both symbolic and legendary. Freemasonry as we know it did not begin there, but all of its ritual is enriched by refer - erice to this magmfiCeflt structure. The Masonic references to it often differ from the accounts written in the Old Testament. For a fufl descriptAOfl of the Temple the Fellow Craft should read the accounts found in the First Book of Kings, ChapterS 5 to 8, and"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"37 36 MENTORS MANUAL the record of another writer found in the First Book of Chronicles, beginning in the second Chapter. The Letter G—The Lettei G is a symbol of geometry and also of the Deity, by whatever name men may call him. A complex symbolism has been developed about the letter G, and the student may procure for his consumption many books and tracts concerning it. Perhaps one simple explanation for both the letter and its situation in the Lodge may suffice. By it the brethren are reminded that their every act is done in the sight of God and that Divine Providence is over all of our lives. The Fellow Craft’s attention is invited to the particular science of Geometry and its connection with the Supreme Architect of the Universe as indicated by the revolution of the stars and planets, moving in a particular order, which man has been able to predict by the use of the science of Geometry. Thus man is reminded that God is in all nature and in every man. Our life and all its blessings come from Him in an ordered pattern, disrupted only by the vileness of man when he moves contrary to the Divine will. In the United States the Letter C is placed in the center of the opened compasses surmounting the square to form the familiar Ma - sonic emblem worn by the members of the Craft. While the use of the emblem is quite common in our country, it is not generally worn by Masons in England and the other nations of the British Common - wealth. The Emblems of a Fellow Craft.—Most of the familiar emblems of the Degree, the Plumb, Square and Level, Corn, Wine and Oil, The Pillars in the Porch, the Winding Stairs, the Thberal Arts and Science. and the Letter G have already been covered and may be found under the preceding headings. These are the emblems with which the Fellow Craft should become thoroughly familiar, for these epitomize the lessons of this Degree of Freemasonry. Each may claim them; but to possess the emblems as your own, you must study them until the lesson implied is engraven upon your heart. The Rights of a Fellow Craft—The rights of a Fellow Craft are much the same as those of an Entered Apprentice. He has the right to sit in his own Lodge when it is opened on the Second Degree of Masonry, and he may visit other Lodges working on the Second Degree if he is accompanied by some Master Mason who knows him. He also has the right to be instructed and to be examined. If he is proficient and worthy, he also has the right to ask for advancement. MENTORS MANUAL The Responsibilities of a Fellow CrafL—The responsibilities of a Fel - low Craft are to be found in his obligation and the candidate should be asked to review the obligations of both this and the First Degree. However, the Fellow Craft is reminded that he is committed to both the acquisition of knowledge and the application of that knowl - edge to the discharge of all of the duties of his life, so that he may fill with satisfaction and honor his place in society."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"38 MENTORS MANUAL Chapter V The Degree of Master Mason Foreword This has been very properly called the sublime Degree of Master Mason as well for the solemnity of the ceremonies which are a part of it, as for the profound lessons of wisdom it inculcates. The important -design of the degree is to symbolize the great doctrines of the res - urrection of the body and the immortality of the soul. This it does in the most profound mariner. The Degree of Master Mason is different in many ways from the two which precede it. Though many of the symbols are the same, the interpretation which is placed on them differs. The Lodge, in the other degrees, is a symbol of the world in which man must labor to sustain life, strive to obtain knowledge, and through wisdom to become virtuous. In the s-uj, lime degree, the Lodge becomes a repre - sentation of the Sanctum Sancto,-um or Holy of Holies of Solomon’s great Temple of Jerusalem. This magnificient structure was a symbol of Heaven to the Hebrew people, for Solomon built it as the dwelling place of Jehovah that he might be in the midst of his people Israel. Here the Hebraic law of cleanliness was strictly enforced and nothing earthy or unclean was permitted to enter the Temple. The Deity was said to dwell between the Cherubim found in the Holy of Holies. In a part of this Degree we are symbolically brought into the presence of God to learn the lessons which it is intended to teach. Thus he who receives this sublime Degree is given its most mag - nificant lesson and greatest truth—that having been faithful to his trust, he must at last die in order to attain the ultimate rewards of his fidelity. The groat design of the Degree becomes that of teaching the immortality of the soul. Man is represented in that state when all of life has fled and he is raised from the grave of iniquity and quickened to another and better existence. Thus, as it has been so aptly put, the ceremonies of the Degree lead to the inevitable conclusion that youth, properly directed, leads to an honorable and virtuous maturity and that, regulated by morality, faith and justice, life will be re - warded in its closing hours by the prospect of eternal bliss and immortality. The Degree has many lessons and meanings to be imparted to man. None of these is finished, but each leads to new inspirations so that each time it is examined the brother may find new and undiscovered meanings in it. It is entirely understandable that our Masonic fore- F MENTORS MANUAL fathers chose to call this the sublime degree, for it is that in every respect. The Significance of the Degree.—We can best understand the signifi - cance of the Degree of Master Mason if we compare it with the De - grees of Entered Apprentice and Fellow Craft. In the first two- degrees architecture was the theme of our symbolism. In the Degree of Master Mason our symbols are of a different character; they speak of life, its tragedy and of its ultimate triumph if we attain virtue. Thus the voice of symbolism in this degree leaves the mundane and deals with the spiritual part of man’s life. Its solemn teachings remind each of us that we stand on the thres - hold of immortality in all of the latter years of our manhood and that we have a work to perform which is given us by the Supreme Archi - tect of the Universe. In our recognition of the fact that work comes from God we are identified with Him to the extent that each becomes in a sense immortal. Resurrection and immortality are both significant lessons of this degree. Preparation.—The observing candidate will discover several differences in his preparation for this degree when he compares it with that in the other two. Through the clothing he is again reminded that he is to be humble; he is also taught that his obligations become more- extensive and binding each time he advances. He is again reminded that he attains many of his desires only with the assistance given him by a friend and brother. The Reception.—As in the preceding degrees reception is meant to include all of the ceremonies transpiring at the West Gate. The in - strument to which attention is called reminds one that all of the tenets of Freemasonry must be implanted in the heart if they are to serve their ultimate purpose and become a part of your way of life. To be fully effective all of these must bear fruit through their practice in our daily lives. The Perfect Square.—In the earlier degrees each initiate was required to form an oblong square with the assistance of one of the Lodge officers. In this, the sublime degree, the perfect square is formed to symbolize the necessity for each man to seek perfection or that ap - proximation of it made possible by our knowledge at the time. The square also has many other symbolic applications which are recounted under the word itself, as written in the section of this Manual devoted~ to the Degree of Fellow Craft. r”r"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"40 MENTORS MANUAL The Obligation.Th~ obligation is the heart of the Degree, for by its assumption one obtains the privileges, the rights and benefits of the society in which he has sought membership. The new Mason must be reminded that a knowledge of the obligation is essentially necessary if he is to keep and perform it. Every brother should com - mit this obligation to memory and employ it as a yardstick by which he may measure the minimum duty toward God, his neighbor and himself. Clandestine Lodge and Clandestine Mason.A clandestine Lodge is one which does not owe its existence to a charter or warrant issued by some regular Grand Lodge. All Grand Lodges of the world seek to establish fraternal relations with sister Grand Lodges. Many of these are recognized by the Grand Lodge, A.F. & A.M. of Virginia, but this is not the case with others. There are certain standards to which Grand Lodges must conform in order to secure recognition. The Grand Lodges not recognized by our own Grand Lodge and the Lodges holden under such Grand Lodges are considered clandestine to this extent:~visitation by our brethren in such Lodges is not permitted nor may Virginia Masons receive visitors from such Lodges in our own meetings. A clandestine Mason is one who became a Mason in a clandestine lodge and who remains a member of such a lodge. To become a mem - ber of a Virginia Lodge he must not only petition, be elected and receive the degrees, he must also sign a statement of renunciation severing all connection with the irregular lodge. Dotage.Dotag~ is a condition associated with old age and is marked by juvenile desires, loss of memory and failure of judgnient. Medical science cannot fix any given age at which this condition occurs, since it varies from person to person. The Lodge itself must determine whether the petitioner is thus afflicted and comes under this classi - fication. Fullness of years alone does not bar any man from our Fraternity. We simply require that he be mentally alert and mentally healthy. The effect of time on the mental processes should be the subject of any investigation made On a petitioner of advanced age. Signs, Tokens and Words.We attach considerable importance to the signs, tokens and words in Freemasonry because they are an essential part of our modes of recognition. By the use of these one may prove himself to be a Mason and be able to recognize others as such. While these in themselves are insufficient proof of membership, they con- MENTORS MANUAL 41 stitute very important links in the chain of evidence and they are always called f or by one appointed to examine a visitor. The candidate should be reminded that each sign, token and word has a symbolic meaning which should serve to enrich the mind and improve our lives as Masons. (The Mentor should rehearse and ex - plain all of the signs, tokens and words of this Degree with the new Master Mason.) The proper execution of all signs should be stressed, and the new brother should be requested to cultivate the habit of such precise performance as would indicate his respect for the dignity of this part of our ceremonies. The proper execution of the signs will also give testimony to his brethren that he understands the signs and respects the ceremonies. The Working Tools.—The Working Tools of a Master Mason are all of the implements of the stonemason; in the United States the trowel is especially assigned to this Degree. By it the Master Mason is reminded that each must cement the ties between Masons with this instrument and spread brotherly love with it. When we examine the instrument, we will agree that it might more properly belong to the Fellow Craft, who in Operative Masonry puts the stones into place, rather than the designer and overseer who would correspond to our Master Mason. Our English and Scottish brethren assign instruments to the Master Mason which are not enumerated in our own rituals. In these Grand Lodges the working tools of a Master Mason are the Skirrit, Pencil and Compasses. The skin-it is an instrument working on a center pin and used by Operative Masons to mark out on the ground the foundation of the intended structure. The pencil is used in draw - ing plans and designs. The compasses are used to determine the limit and proportion of the several parts of a structure. The skirrit points to that straight and undeviating line of conduct laid down for our guidance in the Holy Bible; the pencil teaches that alt our words and actions are not only observed but recorded by God; and the compasses remind us of His unerring and impartial justice, which having defined for us the limits of good and evil, will either reward or punish us as we shall deserve. The Hiramic Legend.—The Hiramic Legend is woven around Hiram Abif, the skilled artificer who was the son of a widow of the Tribe of Naphtali. There is no character in all of Freemasonry whose life"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"42 MENTORS MANUAL story is so dependent on tradition as this celebrated architect of the Temple. The earlier accounts of this artisan and builder will be found recorded in the 1st Book of Kings, 7:13,14. His coming to work on the great Temple at Jerusalem is mentioned in a letter written to King Solomon by Hiram, the King of Tyre, and recorded in U Chroni - cles, 2:13,14. Each of these references will enable the new brother to have a clearer understanding of Hiram Abif as a figure in history. Freemasons refer to him in several ways: as Hiram the Builder, as the Widow’s Son, but most often as hiram Abif. The word Abif means h%s father or my father and the name would be correctly trans - lated as Hiram, my father, the my father being a term of great re - spect. He was regarded as the father, in a patriarchial sense, of all his workmen on the Temple. The dramatization of this legend ii done to teach the magnificient lesson of fidelity. It should be understood that it is a legend and not factual. Both Hirams are recorded in Holy Writ, but one cannot find any trace of the legend which is used in our Master Mason Degree. The Three Grand Masters.The three mentioned so frequently in our ~ltual concerning the building of the Temple are Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre, and Hiram Abif. These are recorded in the Biblical account of the Temple building. The coupling of the three names together may have a symboli~~ inherited from nearly all of the ancient religions. In most of these the Deity was regard~ as a triad or trinity, by whom, acting conjointiy, only, could anything be done that was done. The secrets known only to our three Grand Masters typify divine truth, known only to this trinitarian deity and not to be communicated to man—the Fellow Craft and workmanuntil he, by industry and steadfast purpose, has completed his spiritual temple. Then, accord - ing to Divine promise, if this temple he has so nobly built is a fit dwelling place for divine truth, the secrets will be communicated to him. With these, the rewards of a well-spent life, the Craftsman can travel into that foreign country toward which each of u~ is journeying The rich symbolism outlined will make the frequent mention of the names and reference to their offices in our ritual understandable. Man is ever reaching outward and Upward seeking for a further knowledge of God and man’s relations with Him, which is divine truth. The Temple of Solomon.Thi 5 magnificient structure was located on Mount Moriah, at Jerusalem It was near the place where Abraham r MENTORS MANUAL was about to offer up his son Isaac. The site was purchased by David, the King of Israel, from Oman, the Jebusite, for it was at this place that the hand of the Destroying Angel was stayed after David had repented. The cost of this threshing floor was fifty shekels of silver, which included the oxen offered by David as a sacrifice to God at the staying of the Destroying Angel in the time of the great pestilence. The incident is recorded in II Samuel 24: 15-25 and in I Chron. 21: [4- 80. The name of the Jebusite and the cost of the threshing floor differ in the two accounts. The building of the Temple was begun in Anno Mundi (year of the world) 2992 and completed in 3000, (about 1012 to 1004 B.C.), seven and one-half years later. The people of Israel had come out of Egypt some four hundred eighty years before as a band of refugees. The mind of this people had grown, for they had conquered a new land, established both a formal religion and a government sufficiently powerful to make possible such a project. The people lost their sense of spiritual direction and destiny so that their Temple was destroyed in the year 586 B.C. by the hordes ot Nebuchadnezzar, the King of the Chaldees. The Symbolism of the Temple.—This is an inexhaustible area of in - terpretation for the student of symbolism. For the purpose of this Manual, however, only ine seems important and will be used. The chief purpose of Solomon’s Temple was to provide a dwelling place for the Most High in tt,e midst of his people Israel. The re - ligious concepts of the people of Israel had grown in respect to God, progressing from the Ark of the Covenant, carried on the shoulders of the Priests, to the great Temple which Solomon erected. The idea that God dwelled with man, however, was still the fundamental whicK dominated human thought and should do so in our own day. There- are those who claim that this was the most perfect edifice ever erected by man. Whether this is the case or not is a matter of pure suppo - sition, but perfection was certainly the goal of both David and Solomon, each of whom had a part in planning God’s dwelling place- among men. The symbolism ot the Temple for a Freemason is founded upon the conception of man himself as a living Temple for the enthrone - ment of God within each of us. Based upon that beautiful passage- in the Pauline letter to the Corinthians, know ye not that ye are the tempLe of God, and that the Spirit of God ciwelleth in you . . . Free - masonry undertakes the task of helping each of its votaries to build N"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"44 ______ — — ~-~1 MENTORS MANUAL a more stately mansion for the indwelling of God. In this task it seeks to cause the individual to become more conscious of the fact that he is a symbolic Temple and that he should aspire to the same type of perfection in his temple of character as Solomon sought for the Temple at Jerusalem. Our individual temples are mental, physical and spiritual and should not be degraded by inferior workmanship on our own part. Solomoa, King of Israel.—Solomon was the son of David and Bath - sheba. He was born about 997 B.C. and became king in 977 B.C. Reigning forty years, he died in 937 B.C. In the history of the Hebrew peoples, the reign of Solomon stands out as one in which the greatest power, prosperity and recognition of that nation were achieved. The name Solomon means peaceful and his reign was one of peace. Hiram, King of Tyte.- —Hiram was a friend of King David and became both ally and friend of King Solomon. According to the Biblical accounts he assisted Solomon by supplying certain materials for the construction of the Temple and in return for these received gifts from Solomon, including twenty cities, (I Kings, 9:11). Our ritual assigns certain duties to Hiram of Tyre, but these are purely logendary. Hiram Abif.—Hiram Abrf was the son of a man of Tyre and one of the daughters of the Tribe of Dan, who lived in Tyre. He was sent by King Hiram to assist King Solomon in the erection and beautifi - cation of the Temple. Hiram Abif was a historical personage and this fact is attested by Holy Writ, the Second Book of Chronicles carrying testimony as to his exAstence and his skill in the arts and crafts of his day. (II Chron. 2:12-14) To Travel in Foreign Countries.—The ultimate goal of our ancient operative brethren was to become Masters so that they might possess secrets and knowledge which would enable them to practice the arts of the builder wheresoever they traveled, even in foreign countries. The brethren of the Spoculative Craft still desire to travel in foreign countries, and those who feel the urge strongly enough study their Masonry diligently that they may receive proper instructions and be permitted to travel and receive Master’s wages. Foreign countries as used in Freemasonry is a symbolic place, not connected with a particular geographical location. Nor is it a word of identification which will enable us to build material temples or 45 MENTORS MANUAL earn higher wages for the work which we do. It is a symbol which has more than one interpretation. preemasonry itself is a foretgfl country to each initiate. If he is to travel in it, if he is to earn a Master’s wages, he must learn its language, understand its customs and study its history. He must become a part of it to fully appreciate and enjoy its privileges and pleasures. Becoming a Master Mason gives each man the right to travel in foreign countries in Freemasonry. He has but to learn its work and keep himself in good standing to find the doors of a hundred Lodges open to him. He will also find much pleasant traveling to be done in the writings of Freemasonry. These cover the fields of history, ~,hilosophy, and branch into numerous other areas leading to countless treasures which each must discover for himself. These are some of the rewards of the Mason who travels in foreign countries. The Wages of a Master Ma~on.—The wages of a Speculative Mason must come from within as he is concerned with moral rather than physical labor Wor. Bro Carl H. Chaudy has aptly said that each brother asks what he will and receives that for which he labors. “I worked for menial’s hire Only to learn dismayed, That any wage I asked of life, Life would have paid. “The intangibles of love, friendship, respect, opportunity, happy labor, and association are the wages of a Master who earns them. Not all do earn them, hence the phrase in the mouth of the Lodge officer, descriptive of his duties, ‘to pay the Craft their wages if any be due...’ Tho Three Rufiians.—There are many symbolic explanations for the appearance of these three in our ritualistic drama. The attempt made to obtain a knowledge of secrets not rightfully theirs and the dire conseluences of their acts are symbolic of many things. To attempt to attain a knowledge of divine truth by means other than as a re - ward for faithful service and the performance of the task of prepar - ing for its reception and enjoyment makes the culprit both a thief and a murderer. Thus each is reminded that rewards must be earned rather than secured by violence. The ruffians are also the “pass~on5” -of the self which a Mason “came here to subdue.”"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"r --_________________________________________ __ 46 MENTORS MANUAL There is another symbolism, quite applicable to the world of today. The first of these ruffians strikes the seat of man’s articulation. When man is enslaved, the first of his privileges to be denied or curtailed is that of free speech and unrestricted communication with his fellows. The seat of man’s affections is the second area attacked; for those who would subjugate a people oppress the families to force compliance to their dictates. The third attack is made upon the seat of man’s reason, for his enemies will always seek to destroy the mind as the final step toward enslavement. Low Twelve.—The number twelve, in ancient symbolism, denotes com - pletion. Whether this meaning arose from the twelve signs of the Zodiac or because the most stable geometric figure, the cube, has twelve distinct edges, is not known. The number twelve did denote a thing fulfilled and was, therefore, an emblem of human life. High twelve denoted noon, when the sun was at its zenith, while low twelve denoted midnight, the blackest of the night. Just as thirteen, an evil omen, follows twelve so does death follow life. Therefore the solemn stroke of twelve marked the completion of human existence in this life and the coming of death. Masonically, therefore, low twelve is a symbol of death. The Five Points of Fellowship.—These five points are symbolized by the Pentalpha or five-pointed star. The connection of this geometrical figure with the builders’ art is not readily apparent. Research has shown that it was used extensively in determining some of the designs for the splendid castles and cathedrals of medieval times. In the center of the Pentalpha, as often used by Masons, is usually seen two clasped hands. These hands were the ancient symbol of the god Fides. The entire symbol signifies to the Mason that both fidelity and readiness to aid each other are to be found in our Order. Thus the star becomes the symbol of true brotherhood. The Lion of the Tribe of .Judah.—The lion, from the earliest times of recorded history, has been a symbol of might and of royalty. It was placed on the standard of the Tribe of Judah because it was the royal tribe of the Hebrew Nation. The Kings of Judah were, therefore, called the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. This was one of the titles of King Solomon. This is the literal meaning of the term, but it also has a symbolic one. The Jewish idea of the Messiah was that of a mighty temporal king. He was designated the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, for it was I MENTORS MANUAL 47 from this tribe that all rulers came. The expression does not, of necessity, refer to Jesus of Nazareth, though the Christian Mason may so interpret the name if he desires. The Lion of the Tribe of Judah also describes the Messiah of the Jewish Mason or the mediator of some of the ancient religions of the East whose worshippers are Masons. Freedom of choice as to the application of these symbols is one of the reasons for the growth of Freemasonry over the centuries. The Lost Word.— The allegory of the search for a lost word does not necessarily mean that the search is conducted for a particular word, for it is not, in fact, the search for a word at all. However, it must be realized that to the ancient mind, the Word signified all truth, but particularly divine truth, the ultimate goal of all men. In the Gospel of John we find the familiar passage, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. In this passage John was not announcing a new doctrine, for this was familiar to the Jewish thought of his day; only his identification of Jesus with the word was new. The idea properly belongs to all ancient philosophy. Among the Greeks it was the Logos (from which comes our own word, logic, the name of the science by which we determine moral truth.) The designation of Truth as the Word was not new even in John’s day. Perhaps the most noble attribute of man is the power of speech, whereby he is able to communicate his thoughts to his fellows. This, as far as we can determine, is not possessed by any other animal. As this fact has been observed by men down through the ages, it must have made a profound impression on the thoughtful minds of all ages. Thus the Word became synonymous with every manifestation of divine power and truth under the ancient systems of philosophy of our world. The Masonic search for the Word symbolizes the search for truth, more particularly divine truth. The lesson conveyed to us is that we must search diligently for that truth and never permit prejudice, passions or conflicts of interest to blind us from its discovery. Our minds must ever be open to the reception of truth from whatever source, and having once received it, to always act agreeably to its dictates. Hence Masons everywhere are devoted to freedom of thought, of speech and of action. In Freemasonry, however, we are not invested with the true Word but with a substitute for it. We are thus reminded that in this life we may approach an approximation of truth, but never attain it in <=4-"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"48 I MENTORS MANUAL perfection. The search will continue; but not unti] we pass into a higher state of existence will divine truth be disclosed to us. The Setting MauL—A wooden instrument used by operative masons to set the polished stones firmly into the wall. These mauls were in use during the period when Solomon’s Temple was being erected. A maul of this type would have properly been in the hands of the Fellow Craft who, in the drama of the Degree of Master Mason, is reputed to have used it in a notable manner just before the completion of the Temple. Drawing upon that incident, it is employed as an emblem, the meaning of which is fully explained in the ritual. The maul has, in different forms, been employed as a symbol of destruction from prehistoric times and it is depicted many times in mythology. One of the best known representations is that of Thor, the Norse god of thunder, who is represented as a powerful man armed with a mighty hammer. Counterparts of this god and his formidable weapon may be found in many of the ancient re]igions as well as in mythology. The Sprig oi~ Acacia.—The Hebrew people by custom planted an acacia aprig at the head of the grave for the two-fold purpose of intimating their belief in immortality and for marking the exact location of the grave. To them the acacia was, because of its evergreen nature, an emblem of both immortality and innocence. The true acacia is the thorny tamarisk which abounds in Palestine, and this is the same tree which had a prominent place in the legend of Osiris. Owing to the hardness of its wood, its evergreen nature and its tenacity of life, this plant or tree had for Egyptian and Jew alike the syinbo]ic significance of immortality. Tradition has it that the wood of the acacia was used to construct the tabernacle and most of the sacred furniture of the Temple. The use of a sacred plant which was employed in the ceremonies of initia - tion was common to all of the ancient mysteries from whence Free - masonry probably inherited it. The Raising of a Candidate.—The expression, raised to the subl’tme Degree of Master Mason, is little understood outside our Fraternity. It refers, of course, to a part of the ceremony of the Degree itself. Symbolically, however, it presents a resurrection after death and I~2auonic faith in the immortality of the soul. This degree is the sublime climax of symbolic Freemasonry. If the I MENTORS MANUAL 49 initiate finds in it only the living, dying and raising of a Master as a literal drama, which is designed to teach the virtues of inflexible fidelity and fortitude, he has received only partial light and seen nothing but a drama with a moral. This sublime Degree is much more than that, for ~l seeks to answer the age-old question uttered by Job, “]f a man die, sha~ he live again?” Mt. Wor. Carl H. Claudy aptly describes some of the great lessons and purposes of the Degree in his Int’roduction to F’reemo.~sonry: “The degree delves into the deepest recesses of man’s nature. While it leads the initiate into the Sanctum Sijinctorum of the Temple, it probes into the Holy of IThlies of his heart. a whole the degree is symbolic of that old age by the wisdom of which ~we may en]oy the happy reflections consequent upon a well- spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality.’ • . it is at once the universal and yearning question of man throughout all ages—and its answer. It teaches no creed, no dogma, no religion; only that there is a hope of immortality; there is a Great Architect by whose mercy we may ]ive again; leaving to each brother his choice of interpretation by which he may reach the Great Beyond. “It teaches the power—and the powerlessness—of evil. For those who are happy in a belief in the resurrection of the physical body which Paul has taught, the degree assures of all that the longing heart can wish. “When the lesson of the greatest hope and dearest wish of all man - kind is made manifest, the Sublime Degree turns to this life and this brotherhood, and in the symbolism of ~he Lion the exposition of the Five Points of Fellowship, the means by which a Mason may claim all that a man may from his brother, and the Word, ties together the Hiramic Legend and daily living in a manner which no thoughtful man may see and hear without a thrill; a way at once awe-inspiring and heartening, terrible yet beautiful, sternly uncompromising yet strange - ly comforting. The ceremony is not of earth, earthy, but of that land of the inner life, that home of the spirit where each man thinks the secret thoughts he tells Tiever—never.” The Marble Monument.—This familiar symbol of the virgin weeping over the broken column, an urn in one hand and the sprig of ever green in the other, with the old man behind her dressing her hair is known to Masons everywhere. The explanation given in our ritual r"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"50 MENTORS MANUAL is sufficiently lucid and familiar to make a repetition unnecessary. This symbol is probably a composite of many parts drawn from mythology and the customs of the ancient peoples. Isis, the wife of Osiris of the Egyptian mysteries, finds her husband’s body encased in a tamarisk tree which had been converted into a column. She carried it away and broke it to release his body. It can be well under - stood that she would weep over the broken column. The ut-n is an ancient sign of mourning. According to ancient custom it was worn around the necks of the mourners at a funeral to catch the tears. It was also customary for mourners to carry an evergreen sprig to the place of interment and deposit it in the grave in testi - mony of belief in a life to come. The Masonic significance of this emblem is that while we mourn for the dead and cherish their memories, yet we believe that they shall ]ive again and we shall see them. The Pot of Incense.—This emblem has a further explanation than that which is offered in our ritual. It was used in the Holy of Holies of the Temple to produce a sweet savor in the actual presence of Jehovah. In the plan of the great Temple the altar of sacrifices whereon were offered the bullocks, lambs and other animals, as well as the peace and sin offerings, was situated in a less sacred place; and these may have been used to impress the peop]e with the necessity for being generous and dedicating their earthly possessions to God. The pure, immaterial offering of a sweet incense, however, was to remind them that the only sacrifice worthy of the Deity himself was the spiritual and immaterial offering of a pure heart. The Bee Hive.—Nothing could be more important to the ancient oper - ative craftsman than the industry represented by this emblem. By his industry he lived and erected those dreams and architectural beauty which have excited the admiration and wonder of mankind. In like manner the virtue of industry is important to the Speculative Craftsman because his temple of human life is incomplete unless every talent is brought to its highest state. The time allotted to man is never sufficient for the complete development of all the possibilities of his mind and character. Nor can any person finish the work begun upon the temple of character except the builder himself. Time is the coin of life and the most precious of all gifts. Not a moment of it should be wasted. In all nature ao single creature is more constantly busy than the MENTORS MANUAL 51 bee. From ancient times this little insect has been an emblem of in - dustry. In the modern language of today a place of great industry is often called a bee hive. No symbol of industry could be more ap - prop nate. Masonry, in every degree, and none more so than that of Master Mason, signifies labor. Toil is noble; idleness is dishonor. Deity himself is recorded as having worked and we see on every hand the titanic results of His labors. Can we, as human beings, fail to do any ]ess? Sileace.—This noble virtue is represented by the Book of Constitutions Guarded by the Tiler’s Sword in our Masonic symbolism. Silence as an excellent virtue was more prized by the ancients than by modern man. The disciples of many of the ancient philosophers were required to practice absolute silence for long periods of time during their probationary period. Silence was also deemed so important in the old religious and philosophical system that it was allotted a special deity. Harpocrates, who was represented as full of eyes and ears, signified to the ancients that many things are to be seen and heard but little is to be spoken. The All-Seeing Eye.—This is a very old symbol of Deity. In the re - ligions of Egypt the god Osiris was represented by an open eye and this symbol was placed in all his temples. Undoubtedly the Hebrew people inherited many of their religious customs and symbols from the Egyptians. References to this particular symbol may be found in the Old Testament, where in Psalm 34 these words are to be found, The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, or in Psalm 121, He that ke.epeth Israel shall neither sleep nor slumber. Thus the idea that Jehovah watched over man was symbolized by the All-Seeing Eye as a manifestation of His ominpresence and omniscience. To the Freemason this symbol becomes a reminder that the things which we do before the eyes of men and those which we do in secret are beheld by the Eye which can explore our innermost thoughts and will witness against us in that tribunal where there are no mis - carriages of justice. The Aachor aad Ark.—The Ark as a symbol is a subject of some con - troversy as to its origin. Some suppose that it refers to the Ark of the Covenant carried by the Israelites; othei~s feel that it refers to the Ark of Noah. In most of the Ancient Mysteries some allusions may be found to the Deluge and Noah’s Ark. Since there are so many symbols common to both Masonry and the Mysteries, it is not sur - prising to find the Ark in Masonic symbolism. The idea of regenera -"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"~2 52 MENTORS MANUAL tion, or a new birth, was familiar in the pre-Christian ages. The symbolism of the Deluge and the Ark, as found in the Ancient Mys - teries, was the means by which the human race was reputed to have been purified and perpetuated. Hence these two symbols were em - ployd in varied forms to teach the doctrine of regeneration. Most of us are familiar with the Grecian myth which represents Charon as the one who ferries the shades of the departed over the river Styx. The funeral rites of the Egyptians also employed an Ark by which the deceased passed to the place of the blessed. The Ark has been used down through the centuries as a symbol of passage from this world to the next. Our own meaning is somewhat similar, for the Ark symbolizes that power or influence by which we are fitted for and raised to a higher state of existence in the life to come. The Anchor does not appear in ancient symbolism. Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles, employed it as an emblem of hope of immortality and of bliss in the life to come. It has been often employed as a symbol of immovable firmness by the Christian Church and also one of hope and patience. It may well represent the hope shared by those who believe there is a peaceful place hereafter for those who make proper use of this life. For the Mason the Anchor and Ark bring to the forefront of our thought the doctrine of God as the Mediator, of regeneration, of res - urrection, and of immortality. The Forty-Seventh Problem of Eudid.—This symbol appears as the frontispiece of Anderson’s Book of Constitutions, which was pub - lished in 1723 in London. The page also bore the word Eitrelca in Greek characters. This was one of the earliest books on Freemasonry ever published and this symbol is, therefore, probably the oldest in our Graft. Another seventy-five years was destined to pass before the monitors of Freemasonry contained illustrations of the emblems and symbols. In the Andersonian Constitution. this symbol and the axiom which it illustrates is declared to be, “the foundation of all Masonry, sacred, civil and military.” The figure itself is known by a variety of titles and names such as the Theorem of Pythagoras, the Theorem of the Bride, and the Theorem of the Three Squares. These are but a few of the many names used to designate the forty-seventh problem of Euclid. If MENTORS MANUAL 53 known to the student of geometry. Its usefulness is also well under - stood by the architect and builder who employ it to square buildings and for the hundred and one other applications of it in the practice of the builders’ art. The use of this implement was considered to be one of the trade secrets of the medieval stonemasons. To this triangle certain moral and philosophical meanings were probably ascribed by the ancients which are now wholly lost to us. It is to be regretted that we understand so little of its meaning that we do not comprehend the statement in the older Monitors that “it teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences.” The ancient moral philosophers attached great importance to geome - try and geometrical figures. One of the greatest of these, Plato, taught that geometry rightly treated is the knowledge of the Eternal. In his day, geometry was the only exact science; hence a knowledge of it was indispensable to one in search of philosophical truth. Pytha - goras is given credit ~or being the first to raise geometry to the rank of a science, and for this he is honored by Freemasons. From this science comes the right triangle and from it the square, both symbolic instruments by which all mental, moral and religious con - duct is tested. The Ro!Ir G]ass.—There is some question as to whether this is, strictly speaking, a Masonic symbol. There is no evidence that it was em - ployed by the ancients. The antiquity of its use as an instrument to measure time is unquestionable, and it is a fitting emblem of the flight of time and of the wasting away of our lives. As an emblem of the swiftl~,r running sands o~ life the Hour Glass finds a real place in our ritual and teaches man a meaningful lesson. The Scythe.—The scythe, in ancient symbolism, was one of the at - tributes of Saturn because he was the god who was reputed to have taught men agriculture. However, Saturn occupied a dual role, for he was also considered to be the god of time. Another ancient myth has it that human ]ife was a brittle thread spun by the three Fates; it was natural, therefore, that this implement of agriculture should become the symbol of that power, exercised by the god of Time, which cuts the thread of life and brings our existence to an end. The Coffin.—To modern man the coffin is an unmistakable emblem of death and the interment of the body. This, however, would not be the case with the Hebrew peoples, for their dead were buried in shrouds and winding sheets only, a custom probably taken from the The remarkable properties of the right angled triangle are well"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"MENTORS MANUAL 55 54 MENTORS MANUAL Egyptians. In the Ancient Mysteries the candidate was placed in a coffin-like chest as a symbolical representation of death. The people of Egypt sometimes employed the coffin for the burial of their dead after the body had been wrapped and mumified, and from their long residence in the land of the Pharoahs the Hebrews must have had a knowledge of this custom. Other Symbols.—The Degree of I~4 aster Mason has many other sym - bols associated with its teachings, but most of these are obvious and fully explained to the new brother in the ritual. Not all of them are as ancient as most of those described in these pages, but each has been selected to teach some truth and to bring home to the initiate a great lesson of Freemasonry. Symbolism cannot be explained in a few weeks, but a study of it will be most rewarding. 2 Chapter VI The Practical Aspects of Freemasonry Upon the completion of his work in the reception of the three De - grees in Freemasonry the candidate acquires membership in the Lodge which elected him to receive those Degrees. His raising to the sublime degree of Master Mason is, in a sense, a “commencement”, for he is at the point where his life as a Master Mason begins. There are certain duties and privileges which are his and which he should claim for the satisfaction and enjoyment they will bring to him. Some of these are recounted for the benefit of the newer brethren in order that they may understand something of the Institution of Which they are a part, find some pride in their membership in the largest and oldest Fraternity in the wor]d, and derive a sense of keen satisfaction from a knowledge of the good work which is done by it. When he became a Master Mason, the doors of a vast storehouse of information were opened to him because his mind had acquired the ability to understand it. There are thousands of books written upon all aspects of our Society. Almost every type of student can find some facet of it which will interest him and he can derive great satis - faction from his reading. The Fraternity is old and has many books written on its history; it teaches by symbols and there are many books on its symbolism; it has a rich philosophy and many scholars have written on this facet; it is a Society governed by a system of laws which has attracted the attention of many men who have written of this part of our Order. Over the centuries it has inspired poetry and music for the enjoyment of those who have an appreciation of the richness of these arts. In fine, each may find for himself a field of interest in which he may study and work if he will. We need but to create the desire within him to do so. A partial listing of books recommended for Masonic students will be found elsewhere in this manual. Some of these may be borrowed from friends; some are in the Grand Lodge Library at Richmond and, if there are duplicate copies, may be obtained on a loan basis. There are several excellent publishing houses from which Masonic books may be purchased if the new brother wishes to start a library of his own. Following the pattern established in the foregoing chapters of this Manual, some of the questions and answers concerning the practical aspects of Freemasonry are presented. The Rights ~f a Master Mason.—The rights of a Master Mason are those of Masonic Relief, Masonic Visitation, and Masonic Burial"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"MENTORS MANUAL MENTORS MANUAL 57 There are certain conditions which peitain to each of these and they should be fully understood. Mosonsc Relief may be applied for by any brother, either to his own Lodge or to an individual Master Mason. Under certain con - d~tions applications for assistance may also be made to Boards of Relief for temporary help. In every case the Lodge, the individual and the Agency each have the right to determine whether the brother requesting aid is worthy and whether such aid can be granted with - out matesial injury to the brother of whom it is requested, or to his famdy. Both the Lodge and the Board of Relief will reserve the right to determine whether it will contribute to the relief of a distressed brother Master Mason and to fix its contribution in ac - coidance with its financial ability and the need of the applicant. Relief is a voluntary function for both the Lodge and the individual; brethren requesting assistance have no vested interest in the Lodge or claim upon the individual Mason which would change this. In order to be eligible for Masonic Relief, the brother must not have been suspended or expelled or have any charges of un-Masonic conduct pending against him at the time he applies. In addition, he must be adjudged to be worthy by those to whom he applies for such relief. The widow and the orphan of a Master Mason who was a member of the Lodge at the time of his death are entitled to consideration if they apply for assistance. The same conditions as to worthiness and the ability and willingness of the Lodge apply in these cases as are outlined for the Master Mason. For all practical purposes the adult child of a deceased brother is not considered an orphan and is not entitled to relic!. A Lodge which locates a sojourning Mason, or his widow and orphans who are destitute, should endeavor to grant them temporary relief while awaiting instructions from the brother’s Lodge, which should be notified at once by the Secretary of the local Lodge. All such matters should be handled through an officer of a chartered Lodge rather than by an individual Mason. If a stranger, representing himself to be a Mason, applies to an individual Mason for relief, the needy brother should be sent on to the Worshipful Master of the Lodge or to the Secretary of the Relief Board, if one exists in the locality. The Masonic Relief Association of the United States and Canada publishes a list monthly in its bulletins of people who claim to be Masons and seek monetary do - nations when they are not entitled to help. These people and other imposters are generally discouraged if they are sent on to Masonic authority by the individual upon whom they have no claim. Should you become financially distressed while in a strange city, you may apply for assistance to a local Board of Relief or through the Masonic Relief Association of the U.S. and Canada, an organ - ization devoted to the assistance of worthy Master Masons who are sojourning in another Grand Lodge jurisdiction. In either case your own Lodge will be contacted and your condition and need explained to onc of the officers. Masonic Visitation is a right which every Mason acquires provided he can prove himself to be a Mason in good standing in a working Lodge and if no member of the Lodge which he seelis to visit objects to his presence. Masonic visitation is one of the most widely used and enjoyed rights as practiced in Virginia. To enjoy it to the fullest extent, the new brother should be urged to prepare himself for examination in each of the three degrees by learning the catechisms, and also to keep himself in possession of a current dues card from his own Lodge. There are two ways in which a Mason may gain admittance to a Lodge, namely, by “due trial or strict examination” or by being vouched for by a brother known to the Tiler or some other brother who is present in the Lodge. The latter would come under the heading of legal Masonic information. Examination for admiss ton is required in every Lodge in which a brother is not known. To obtain such examination, the brother simply presents his dues card to the Tiler with the statement that he requests a committee to examine and vouch for him. The Worshipful Master will name a Committee and the brother will be required to join with them in repeating the Tiler’s Oath as prescribed in our Virginia Ritual. This is simply a sworn statement that you were regularly initiated, passed and raised in a legally constituted lodge, that you do not now stand suspended or expelled and know of no reason why you should be. The brother asking to be examined has the right to see the charter of the Lodge to which he is seeking admission before he is examined, though this is seldom done. The rules of some Grand Lodges require the brother applying for examination to place the jewels in the proper manner on the proper passage in the Bible for each of the degrees before any questions will be asked. These passages of Scripture are: for the E.A. Degree, the 133rd Psalm; for the F.C. Degree, Amos 7; 7-8; and for the M.M. Degree, Ecciesiastes 12 : 1.7. The manner of displaying the jewels is a part of the ritual and is carefully taught each Virginia Mason •1"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"MENTORS MANUAL 59 58 MENTORS MANUAL It is well to remember that there is no fixed examination for visi - tors. That which will satisfy one committee will be deemed insufficient for another. The Committee appointed by the Master must satisfy itself that the visitor is a Master Mason, that he belongs to a regular Lodge, and that they are willing to vouch for him as such. Legal Masonic information may be imparted by one Mason to an - other when each of them is satisfied that the other is a member of the Craft. Such information would concern a third brother unknown Masonically to one of them. This might be done simply by saying, “I vouch for this brother”, if he is present, or “I vouch for Brother Jones, whom you know.” It is also possible to impart Masonic information by inference in some instances. For example, if the Grand Master is visiting your Lodge or District and is accompanied by a brother not known to you as a Mason, the very fact that the Grand Master brings him to your Lodge means that he vouches for him by inference. Such inferential avouchment should not be generally accepted except from the Grand Master. Neither he nor the Grand Lodge officers will find it objection - able if the Master or the Tiler requests them to vouch for the Masonic regularity of their traveling companions. This, however, should be cared for before the Lodge meeting to avoid embarrassing the brother or the Grand Master. The Right of Burial is a privilege reserved for Master Masons in good standing at the time of death. Masonic funeral rites are con - ducted only at the request of the deceased or some member of his immediate family. The choice belongs to the family and not to the Lodge, though the Master of the Lodge may, for good and sufficient reasons, decline to conduct any funeral. There are two services, one which is held at the graveside following the religious service, and the other held on the evening before inter - ment in the funeral home. Both types should be explained to the family and their wishes in the matter be followed unless the Master deems it inexpedient to conduct one or the other of the services. Each Mason should attend the funeral communications of his Lodge whenever it is possible. Our funeral service is old and should be handled in a dignified and impressive manner, which can only be done if the services are supported properly by the brethren. The Responsibilities of a Master Mason.—”To preserve the reputation of the Fraternity unsullied” is the constant responsibility of the Master Mason, for he is Freemasonry to many people in the circle of influence which surrounds every life. An exemplary life is the best means by which we can discharge our individual responsibility to our own Lodge in particular and to Freemasonry in general. The conduct of each Master I~4ason is strictly his own responsibility; he should choose the course which will bring credit to himself and honor to the Fraternity. Responsibility for Lodge Attendance is one which should merit the earnest consideration of every brother. Attendance was the subject of one of the charges of the Medieval Craft in which it was stated that “no Master or Fellow could be absent from the Lodge, especially when warned to appear, without incurring severe censure, unless it appeared to the Master and Wardens that pure necessity hindered him.” Our present day system of Freemasonry does not have minimum attendance requirements, nor is there a penalty prescribed for ab - sence. However, every Master Mason has a moral obligation to be loyal to the Lodge which gave him Masonic light and all the benefits which come with it. This moral obligation should induce each brother to attend as regularly as possible and partake of the fellowship which is part and parcel of Freemasonry. Responsibility of Balloting is another area which should be explored by the new Mason to determine the course which he should pursue in exercising this privilege. Each Master Mason who is present when a petition is considered must, if he be a member of the Lodge, cast his ballot for or against the petitioner. The white balls are the affirm - ative or favorable ballot; the black cube is the negative or unfavor - able ballot. If the individual knows nothing against the petitioner and his own inquiries have brought to light no unfavorable infor - mation, the word of the candidate’s vouchers should be accepted and a favorable ballot cast. If, on the other hand, a knowledge of the petitioner indicates that he is unworthy, one should not hesitate to use the black cube to pro - tect the Lodge from undesirable members. Let each Mason as he ap - proaches the ballot box examine his own motives and pray that the ballot he is about to cast will do justice to the candidate, to Free - masonry, and to himself. Thus Freemasonry has in the past and will continue in the future to build a membership of worthy Sons. The Right to Secrecy of the Ballot is guaranteed by Masonic law, and custom allows each member to have perfect freedom in balloting on petitioners. No brother may disclose a favorable ballot for a pe - titioner and no Mason has a right to inquire into how another voted on a particular candidate. The Responsibility to Examine Visitors belongs to the Lodge itself and is delegated by the Worshipful Master to a committee of brethren K"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"60 MENTORS MANUAL MENTORS MANUAL 61 who are to satisfy themselves that the visitor is a Master Mason in good standing and a member of a regular Lodge holden under a Grand Lodge with which we are in fraternal relations. The Worship - ful Master may call upon any member of the Lodge to serve on the examining committee. Its duties are outlined briefly. The visitor should first be required to submit his name, address, name of the Lodge of which he is a member, together with his current dues card to indicate his good standing. The regularity of the Lodge should be verified by reference to a current copy of the List of Regular Masonic Lodges, published by the Pantagraph Printing and Station - ery Company. If the lodge is located outside the United States and Canada, it is well to consult our Grand Lodge Proceedings to verify our recognition of the Grand Lodge under which it is holden. Visi - tation is permitted only to members of Lodges recognized by our own Grand Lodge. The next step is to require visitor and the Committee to take the Tiler’s Oath, found in our ritual. The last step is to examine him on the catechisms of the three degrees to an extent sufficient to satisfy the Committee beyond any reasonable doubt that he is a Master Mason. No hints or prompting of any kind should be given the visitor during this examination. Leaving the visitor without the tiled door, the Committee should return and report its findings to the Worshipful Master of the Lodge, vouching for the brother as a Master Mason if he has satisfied them. The Worshipful Master will then request the Committee to retire and bring the visitor into the Lodge for introduction to the brethren. The Responsibility of Vouchers on Petitions is one of the duties most frequently shirked by the brethren generally because they do not understand it. Before endorsing the petition of anyone for initia - tion, time should be taken to discuss the matter with the applicant. The endorser should know why he wishes to become a Mason and as - certain if he knows what he may expect and what may be expected of him. He should be asked if he is prepared to give the time neces - sary to discharge his duties of a Mason—to attend Lodge, visit the sick, assist the officers by working on the various committees when selected, and to devote some of his energies and thought to the study of Freemasonry in order that he might have a full appreciation of it. Part of this is covered by the work of the Investigating and Indoctri - nating Committee when it is used by a Lodge, but the endorser should know the answers for himself. If, after your interview, you are satisfied with his understanding and know that he is of good moral character, the endorsement of the petition of a friend should be a source of pleasure. However, the signing of the petition will also demand your presence in the Lodge to give voice to your recommendation for the benefit of the other brethren. The recommendation in Lodge prior to the ballot should disclose (a) the length of time you have known the petitioner; (b) a statement concerning his family life; (c) a statement concerning his church affiliation and activities, if any; (d) a statement concerning his business and civic activities; and (e) any other pertinent infor - mation concerning him which you consider of interest. No endorser should “damn a petitioner with faint praise” by saying, “I have known him for ten years and know of no reason why he should not be a Mason.” The Lodge wants to know the reasons why he should be allowed to become a Mason. The Responsibility to Investigate Petitioners belongs to every mem - ber of the Lodge and should not be taben lightly if your own Masonic household is to be protected against undesirable members. The In - vestigating Committee is a recent addition to Freemasonry and the fact that the Worshipful Master usually appoints such a committee does not relieve the individual of his responsibility to scrutinize those who seek to enter the Lodge. To serve on the Investigating Committee should be regarded as a mark of especial trust by those selected. The Master will generally appoint only those on whom he can count to make a complete and impartial inquiry into the petitioner’s character and determine his worthiness to become a Mason. The brother who accepts such an appointment should be prepared to discharge the duties required of him promptly and thoroughly. The Financial Responsibility of a Mason.—The financial respon - sibility of a Mason is measured in two areas. First, in the area of mandatory support, namely, Lodge dues. Second, in the area of volim - tary support, namely, of the Masonic Home through its individual’ appeals and the appeals made by the individual Mason who is worthy In the first the brother must carry his share of the expense imposed, by the Lodge. In the second, he must be the sole judge of the extent of his participation, measuring the need against his ability. Every Lodge in Virginia is required to have by-laws, one section of which fixes the amount that each member must pay in monthly or annual dues. Dues are collected on the basis and at the time. specified in the by-laws of the Lodge. The Worshipful Master or the Secretary will inform each new Master Mason of the amount and the date on which these dues are payable. Any member failing to pay his dues for a period of more than j"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"MENTORS MANUAL 62 twelve months is subject to citation in accordance with the Grand Lodge law on this subject. The word citation is probably a new one to many of the younger Masons. It is, in effect, a summons to appear at the next stated communication of the Lodge and to show cause why he should not be suspended from membership therein. The receipt of a citation of this character is not to be treated lightly, since failure to answer it can result in the loss of membership in your Lodge and Freemasonry. Each brother who becomes a Mason takes upon himself a solemn obligation to assist distressed Master Masons, their widows and orphans under certain well-defined conditions. It should be remem - bered that such appeals may involve more than monetary aid, for man’s needs are often more acute in other fields. The appeal for financial assistance from one brother to another, on an individual basis, is not often heard in present day society. However, the need to care for the aged as well as the orphan still exists. To answer this, the Grand Lodge of Virginia established the Masonic Home of Virginia in 1890. In 1955 the Adult Division was opened. Annually the Grand Masters have directed appeals to the individual brethren to make cash contributions to the Endowment Fund of the Masonic Home on Founders Day, October 13th. These contributions serve a two-fold purpose. First, they serve to create an interest in the Masonic Home, and second, they help to increase the Endowment Fund. The income from that fund can be used for the operation of the Masonic Rome, but the principal remains intact. The Inability of a Brother to Pay Dues is a matter which can be handled without embarrassment to the brother needing such con - sideration. The Lodge has no desire to suspend any brother who is financially unable to pay his dues due to circumstances over which he has no control. In most cases, however, nothing is known of his predicament by his brethren. A Mason who finds himself in financial strats should not hesitate to make his situation known to the Wor - ship ful Master or the Secretary of his Lodge. One of these officers will handle the matter so that his dues are cared for and no debt is accumulated against him on the account books of the Lodge. This is not Masonic charity, but rather it is brotherly love. However, it should be clearly understood that the brother who finds himself un - able to pay his dues has an obligation to make his situation known to the Lodge. Lodge Membership.—Each brother acquires membership in the Lodge K - i MENTORS MANUAL 68 which elected him to receive the degrees. This membership is effec - tive when he is raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. To continue to enjoy the privileges which belong to the Freemason, every brother must hold membership in a working Lodge. The term “work - ing Lodge” is used in this instance to distinguish it from the Research Lodges which do not make Masons and which usually require that membership be maintained in another Lodge also. The retention of membership is accomplished by the payment of dues and keeping wnder the tongue of good report in the community. Dual and Plural Memberships are allowed under our Masonic law in Virginia both within and without the State, provided the Grand Lodge of the other jurisdiction also permits such membership. Dual membership means that a brother may belong to two Lodges; plural membership means that he may belong to as many Lodges as will elect him to membership. It should be remembered that dues must be paid in every Lodge to which a brother belongs and that if he is sus - pended for non-payment of dues in one Lodge, he is automatically sus~ pended in all of them. Termination of Masonic Membership is accomplished in three ways: by dimit or withdrawal, by suspension, or by death. A Dimit is a simple statement issued by the Secretary of a Lodge under its seal, showing that the brother named therein was, on the date of the instrument, clear on the books of the Lodge and at his own request had withdrawn from membership. A dimit may be re - quested by any member of a Lodge. If he does not owe any dues and there are no charges pending against him, the Lodge must issue it. A dimit may be used to affiliate with another Lodge, in which case it. must be filed with the petition for membership as an evidence of the brother’s right to petition. Holders of dimits from a Virginia Lodge may visit another Lodge in Virginia for a period of six months after the date of the dimit. This is done to enable a brother moving froim one location to another to determine which Lodge he would like to. enter. After this period of time has passed, the holder of a dimit. becomes a non-affiliate and as such has only one Masonic right—that. of petitioning a Lodge for membership. A dimit is never out of date. Suspension may be imposed by the Lodge in which a brother holds membership if he fails to answer a citation for failure to pay hi~ dues. Suspension or expulsion may also be imposed by a Trial Coin - missicn as punishment for a violation of Masonic law which results in the placing of Masonic charges against a brother and his trial before such Commission."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"64 M ENTORS MANUAL A Mason suspended for non-payment of dues may apply for rein - statement to the rights and benefits of Masonry and restoration to membership in his Lodge at any time, provided he first pays the amount for which he was suspended. A Mason suspended for a Ma - sonic offense may apply to the Lodge from which he was suspended after the lapse of six months. If the sentence be expulsion, twelve months must elapse before such application can be made. Affiliatio~i or Membership in a Lodge may be requested of any Lodge iE Virginia by a member of another Lodge who is presently in good standing or by a non-affiliate who holds a valid dimit. The petition must carry the endorsement of two Master Masons, preferably mem - bers of the Lodge petitioned, be read at a stated communication, and lie over for one lunar month (28 days). The ballot is usually spread on such petition at the following stated communication and must be unanimous for him to obtain membership. The Lodge may also require any brother who holds membership in another Lodge to secure a certificate of good standing showing that his dues are paid three months in advance. The laws of our Grand Lodge provide that any Lodge accepting a brother into membership who is indebted to another Virginia Lodge may be held responsible for his arrea rages. To Retain Continuous Membership is desirable on the part of the petitioner. This will enable him to obtain promptly the dues-free benefits given to our fifty-year veterans and to bring him much satis - faction in the later years of his life. To insure continuous member - ship during transfers from one Lodge to another, the petitioner must obtain a certificate showing that his dues are paid three months in advance. He then files a petition to retain membership in one Lodge until elected in another, together with a request for a dimit addressed to the Secretary of the Lodge in which he holds membership. After the Lodge petitioned has elected him to membership, the request for the dimit is mailed and he becomes a member of the new Lodge on the date of his dimit from the old. Entering and Retiring From a Lodge.—Under normal circumstances ~each of the brethren should endeavor to be present when the Lodge is opened and remain until it is closed. There are times when almost everyone must be late, or circumstances which force him to leave be - fore the Lodge is closed. A brother wishing to enter a Lodge after it has opened simply informs the Tiler, who will make the alarm and ~inform the Junior Deacoii of the fact that he vouches for you and that you wish to be admitted. When the Master gives his permission for you to enter, simply approach the altar, salute the Master, using MENTORS MANUAL 65 the proper sign, and await his invitation to be seated. If you wish to retire, approach the altar, salute the Master and request that you be permitted to retire. You may leave when the Master instructs the Junior Deacon to permit you to do so. Deportment While in Lodge.—The deportuient of a brother while the Lodge is at labor is governed by the rules of good taste. Generally speaking, individuals should not engage in private conversations or through any other action on their part disrupt the business of the Lodge. Any brother who disrupts the business of the Lodge in an offensive manner or otherwise disturbs its peace and harmony may be requested to leave and, if necessary, escorted out by the Deacons. Making a Motion in the Lodge is a privilege which belongs to every member. It is also the proper manner of presenting a proposition to yom~r Lodge for adoption. Under normal circumstances motions may be made by arising, saluting the Master and upon recognition, stating the prop ~smtion and the motion to him. No second is necessary in a Virginia Lodge. If the motion is in order and considered to be in the best interest of the lodge by the Worshipful Master, he will accept it, and in so doing he becomes, in effect, its seconder. If he deems the motion out of order or contrary to the best interest of the Lodge, the Master may so rule and refuse to allow any discussion on the si~bject (I Al~ busine’~s of th~ Lodge is transacted at its stated communications. If some ainarticular business is necessary at a called communication, the Woi ,hipful Master must require that proper notice of the meet - n: dato, time and business be given to every member of the Lodge. Any propo~~tion to amend the by-laws of a Lodge or to create a new by-law must be submitted in writing and signed by the propo - nent. All such amendments are simply read and must lie over for one month, the membership of the Lodge must be notified before any action 7 in be taken on the proposal.

Each should observe the rules of propriety and refrain from indulging in ~ersonalities or d:sturbing the peace and harmony of the Lodge q,enemnlly speaking, no bmtber should speak more than twice on the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"66 MENTORS MANUAL same subject unless he has the permission of the Lodge or is answer - ing some question or explaining some statement previously made. There are certain subjects which may not be discussed in a Masonic Lodge. These are such as pertain to religions, partisan politics and nations, any one of which would tend to disrupt the peace and harmony of the Lodge. The introduction of such subjects would be a violation of Virginia ~dasonic law and would subject the offender to Masonic charges and disciplinary action, if he were ~djudged guilty. Voting in a Masonic Lodge is usually by voice vote, using the ayes and nays. The Worshipful Master may, in his discretion, require a show of hands and cause these to be counted. When petitions for initiation and membership are considered, the ballot box, with the balls and cubes, is always used. At the annual meeting of the Lodge, when the officers are elected, a written ballot is required for every office which has two or more nominees. The Rules of Order in our Masonic Lodges are different from those used in other organizations; we do not follow Roberts Rules. Under Masonic law the Worshipful Master rules and governs his Lodge, controls the order of business, and may refuse to entertain any propo - sition which he deems not in the best interest of the Lodge. The decision of a Worshipful Master may not be appealed to his Lodge, the course of such appeals being through the District Deputy Grand Master to the Grand Master. The Officers of a Lodge.—Every Masonic Lodge is governed by its Worshipful Master assisted by time two Wardens. In addition to these three, the Lodge elects four other officers. These are the Treasurer, Secretary, Senior and Junior Deacons. The Worshipful Master also appoints two Stewards, a Chaplain and the Tiler to complete the list of officers. Some Lodges also have other officers, such as a Marshal and Purveyor, but these are not specified in the law and their appointment is made at the will and pleasnre of the Worshipful Master or as specified in the by-laws of Lhe Lodge. The duties of these officers are fully covered in the Virginia Me - thodmcal Digest and it is not necessary to repeat them in this Manual. The Office of Worshipful Master is open to any Master Mason who is a member of the Lodge. However, to be eligible for election the brother must have served at least twelve months as a Warden, and he must also have a current certificate from the Grand Lecturer or r MENTORS MANUAL 67 other member of the Committee on Work that he is capable of open - ing and closing the Lodge and can confer the three Degrees of Craft Masonry. These two requirements are imposed to insure the proper government of our Lodges and the purity of our ritual. Any member of the Lodge may hold any of the other elective offices to which his brethren see fit to elect him. Virginia Masonic law re - quires that a brother must have received the Degree of Past Master prior to his installation as a warden. All appointments are made by the Worshipful Master and these brethren serve at his will and pleasure. Virginia law allows for the appointment of members of other Lodges as Chaplain, Stewards and Tiler, if suitable brethren cannot be found among the members to fill these offices. Masouie Law.—Freemasonry is an orderly society which has a code of laws for the government of the Lodge and the individual Mason. Such laws are enacted by the Grand Lodge. In Virginia all of the applicable laws are printed in the MethodicaL Digest in it also are found the decisions of Grand Masters which have been approved by the Grand Lodge and have the effect of law. These decisions are in the form of annotations. In addition to the written law to which reference has been made, there are those ancient usages and customs which have, over the centuries, become a part oL the unwritten laws of the Fraternity. Most of these are simple, yet they have in them the essence of all of Freemasonry. The Basic Masonic Law rests upon the Old Charges and the Con - stitutions of Masonry as these were compiled by the Rev. James Ander - son, George Payne and John T. DeSaguliers around 1722-23. Our own Virginia law began with these and has expanded as the times and circumstances have required, until our present system of Masonic jurisprudence has been evolved. The original Book of Constitutions was adopted by the Grand Lodge of Virginia in 1791. It is divided into six chapters of varying length and has laws governing such things as that titled “Concerning God and Religion,” “Concerning Government and the Civil Magistrate”, and many other titles. It also covers the officers of a Lodge and their duties, the officers of the Grand Lodge, and other regulations concerning it. The Book ends with the chapter headed “Of Grand Visitations and Communications.” The reading of the Book of Constitutions should be recommended to every new brother who comes into our Craft. An Explanation of Masonic Law is available in several excellent books written on the general subject of Masonic jurisprudence. Albert"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"68 MENTORS MANUAL MENTORS MANUAL G. Mackey’s Juijaprudence of Freemasonry covers a basic explanation of the subject and is highly regarded by students of Masonic law. Masonic Law and Practice, written by L. A. Lockwood, and Silas H. Shepherd’s T/re Landmarks of Frecrnason?y also cover some part of the field of Masonic jurisprudence which i~ of general interest, Specifically, Virginia Masonic Law is divided into four general classifications dealing with the Grand Lodge in all facets of its oper - ation; with the subordimmate Lodge and matters concerning its opera - tions; with the individual Mason and his conduct; and with Masonic offenses, trials and penalties. The Enactment of Masommic Law is done by the Grand Lodge at its annual Communications. Amendments or new laws may be offered at the communication wilh the unanimous consent of the Grand Lodge or with the approval of the Grand Master. The new brother should be told that the voting power of the Grand Lodge is centered in the representatives of the subordinate Lodges in Virginia, and that the laws are enacted by their vote. If he has an interest in Masonic law, he should be en - couraged to purchase a copy of the Methodical Digest for his own use and enjoyment. Masonic Offeases.—~.What constitutes a Masonic offense? Every brother owing allegiance to the Grand Lodge, A.F. & A.M. of Virginia, and those Masons sojourning in its territorial jurisdiction are required to support the establishment of government; obey the civil laws; keep inviolable the mysteries of the Order; preserve and obey the laws, resolutions and edicts of the Grand Lodge; observe the Ancient Land - marks of Masonry; and discharge their duties and obligations to their families, to each other and to mankind in general. Wilful failure to comply with any of these requirements is a Masonic oIl’ense; the brother who does so may be subject to Masonic charges and trial therefor. If found guilty, the brother will be subject to such discipli - nary action as the Trial Commission may prescribe, subject to the right of appeal. Masonic Charges may be brought in only one Lodge for the same offense and then through the process of accusation, investigation by a committee which the Worshipful Master will usually appoint, and the formulation and presentation of the charge itselr at a stated com - munication of the Lodge. The charge is simply a formal statement of the willful violation of the laws of the Grand Lodpe, supported by specifications setting forth the circumstances of such violation. Masonic Trials.—While the matter of Masonic Offenses and Masonic Charges are considered in the Lodge itself, Masonic trials are held before a Commission of Past Masters appointed by the District Deputy Grand Master. No member of the accused brother’s Lodge may be a member of such Commission, nor may any relative serve on it. Even close friends should disqualify themselves if appointed. At such Masonic trials the Lodge is represented by the Junior Warden or someone designated to act in his stead. The accused may be represented by counsel or any other brother, but the representative must be a Master Mason. If the accused desires to do so, he may defend himself at such trial. Witnesses for the accused brother will be summoned in the Masonic manner by the Trial Commission at his request, The Trial follows normal procedures in that the charges and specifi - cations should be read to the accused and he should then be asked’ how he pleads—guilty or not guilty. The representative of the Lodge then presents its case by the use of witnesses and evidence. The ac - cused or his representative is privileged to examine every witness who testifies. At the conclusion of the Lodge’s case the accused’ brother then presents such refutations and other data as to circum - stances and calls such witnesses as he may desire. The Lodge also has the right of cross-examination and the Trial Commission may also question any witness when he is being examined. The Trial Commission has but one interest—the determination of the facts in the case and the extent of the guilt of the accused, if he is guilty. The Commission, in seeking to obtain the facts, will make its own rules as to permitting statements and arguments by the representatives of the accuser and the accused. The Trial Commission will reach its verdict in executive session. This verdict and the punishment will be transmitted to the District Deputy Grand Master and by him to the Lodge through its Secretary. The punishment for a Masonic offense is expulsion, suspension or reprimand, listed in the order of severity. The accused will be notified of the verdict of the Commission in writing by the Secretary of the Lodge. An Appeal may be taken by either the accuser or the accused within sixty days of the date of the notice of such verdict sent to the ac - cused by the Secretary of the Lodge. This may be done by writing a letter to the Secretary of the Lodge which contains a simple state-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"I 70 MENTORS MANUAL merit that the accused desires to appeal the verdict of the Commission. The appeal is passed on to the Grand Master through the District Deputy and all appeals are usually considered at the Annual Com - munication of the Grand Lodge by the Committee on Appeals. Their findings are either approved or disapproved by the Grand Lodge itself. The Grand Lodge.~The Grand Lodge is the supreme governing body of Freemasonry in Virginia and derives its powers from the Craft itself. Anciently every Mason had the right to be present at the Grand Lodge or General Assembly of Masons, to participate in its deliberations, and to vote on every issue coming before that body. In modern Freemasonry the Craft elects the Master and Wardens of its Lodges and these three are the representatives of that segment of the Craft who are members of the particular Lodge. Thus the supreme body still derives its power from the Craft. The Grand Lodge, Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons of the Com - monwealth of Virginia, is composed of the Grand Master of Masons in Virginia, the Deputy Grand Master, the Grand Wardens, the Grand Treasuxer, Grand Secretary, and the Grand Deacons. In addition are the Past Grand Masters, Past Deputy Grand Masters and Past Grand Wardens, the representatives of subordinate Lodges, the District Deputy Grand Masters, and the Past Masters of subordinate Lodges not in other classifications. (Sec. 1.06 M.D.) The representatives of the subordinate Lodges are its Masters and Wardens or their proxies. The Function of’ the Grand Lodge is that of a supreme legislative, judicial and executive body when it is in session. It makes the laws by which it, the subordinate Lodge and the individual Mason are governed in the exercise of its legislative function. It is judicial in that it sits in judgment on all appeals made to it and on the work of its officers and committees, it is executive in that it determines the policies of the Craft and provides for their execution. The Grand Master controls the conduct of all business coming be - fore the Grand Lodge, and when it is in vacation, all of its powers are vested in the Grand Master. During the period between the annual communications of the Grand Lodge the Grand Master may suspend any law or resolution enacted by the Grand Lodge; issue dispensationa for the formation of new Lodges and such other purposes which he may deem necessary; he may appoint Commissions; make decisions concerning the operation or laws, etc., and perform such other acts as may be imposed on his office by law or custom. lie reports all of his official acts to the Grand Lodge in his annual address. i (1 MENTORS MANUAL ‘71 The Grand Lodge meets annually on the second Monday in February. Proposals and propositions are assigned to appropriate committees, whose meetings the delegates and interested brethren are invited to attend. These committees then prepare reports for the consideration of the Grand Lodge. The Grand Master’s Address is referred by law to the Committee of Past Grand Masters which makes recommendations to the Grand Lodge for the permanent adoption of his decisions, rulings and recom - mendations on which it finds such approval necessary. Upon adoption of a decision or ruling of a Grand Master by the Grand Lodge, if It deals with Masonic law, that decision or ruling becomes a part of our Grand Lodge law without being actually written into it. The disapproval of any decision or ruling of the Grand Master does not. affect the particular act but governs only the future actions of other Grand Masters. History of the Grand Lodge of Virginia The first Grand Master of Masons in Virginia, Judge John Blair, Jr., of the Williamsburg Lodge, was elected by a Convention of dele - gates from the several Virginia Lodges on October 13, 1778, and was installed into that office on October 30th of the same year. We date our history as a Grand Lodge from the date of his election. A suc - cession of distinguished brethren has followed Judge Blair In the office of Grand Master. These brethren have come from all walks In life and each has brought something of himself to the office, provid - ing leadership which has secured a position of prominence and respect in the Masonic world scarcely dreamed of by its founders. A history of the beginning of our Grand Lodge will be found in almost every edition of the Proceedings; it is recommended that every new iviason familiarize himself with it. This is the record of the birth of our Grand Lodge; this is our Virginia Masonic heritage of which we may well be proud. The Grand Lodge, Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons, has been continuously at labor since 1778 as the only Masonic Grand Lodge in Virginia. It is the oldest independent Grand Lodge in the United States, for it was never a Provincial Grand Lodge, was never held under the authority of a Provincial Grand Master, but has been continuously under the authority of the Grand Master of Masons in Virginia by the sovereign will of the Craft. George Washington George Washington, the greatest American, is the only brother in the history of our Craft to have served as President of the United"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"V 72 MENTORS MANUAL States and Master of his Lodge simultaneously. Washington was a Virginia Mason and the Lodge which he served as Worshipful Master was a Virginia Lodge~Alexand~i~ No. 22. Washington was initiated an Entered Apprentice in the Lodge at Fredericksburg on November 4, 1752; passed to the Degree of Fellow Craft on March 3, 1753 and raised to the sublime Degree of Master Mason on August 4, 1753. Until he died, George Washington remained a member of his mother Lodge at Fredericksburg. When Alexandria Lodge, No. 39 on the register of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania sought a charter from the Grand Lodge of Virginia, the brethren requested that Washington become its first Master. The charter was granted on April 28, 1788, with this illustrious brother’s name as its chief officer. Washington served as Master for a period of twenty months, eight by virtue of his appointment and a full twelve months by the suffrage of his brethren This was during the period in which he was serving as President of the United States. On September 18, 1793, Washington laid the cornerstone of the United States Capitol with Masonic ceremonies. On this occasion he was acting as Grand Master of Maryland and was escorted to the building’ site by Alexandria Lodge No. 22 and Potomac Lodge No. 5, now of the District of Columbia, but then under the Grand Lodge of Maryland. Washington’s pride in I reemasonry is to be seen in the many occasions on which he mingled with his brethren both during the War for Independence and during his later life. Washington, the soldier, Washington, the statesman, was also Washington the Mason. The brethren of Alexandria Lodge No. 22 conducted the funeral rites for this great man when he anewered the final summons of the Supreme Grand Master in 1799. The Mento~ may unhesitatii~~~>,. recommend to each new brother the reading of the excellent books titled George Washington, the Man and the Mason, by Charles, H. Callahan P G M and George Washsng - ton, I c~nason, by Williani Moseley Brown, P.G.M.

Roosevelt, 32nd President; Harry S Truman, 33rd President; and Gerald R Ford, 38th President. Persist ant claims of Masonic membership have been made for Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. In both cases documentary evidence is lacking and we must conclude, therefore, with some reluct - ance that these two distinguished Americans and native Virginians had no connection with the Craft. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution Signers of the Declaration of Independence who were probably Freemasons numbered twenty-four of the fifty-six whose names appear at the end of this immortal document. As in the case of I~1asonic Presidents, many have sought to connect more of the siguers with the Masonic Fraternity, but documentary proof of their membership cannot be produced and Freemasonry will be best served by omitting the names where such doubts exist. Those who made great and lasting contributions to the establish - ment of our government numbered many Freemasons in their ranks. Some of the philosophies of Masonry are to be found in the Constitu - tion of the United States, but these are the great and time-honored philosophies of those men of courage who believe in the worth and diguity of the individual and in the responsibility of man for his brother. However, to say that our form of government came from Freemasonry would be an overstatement of the case. The writing of the Constitution was a matter which occupied con - siderable time, but the authors were thorough as is evident because~ of the few amendments offered in more than a century and three- quarters. The basis of the Constitution was the “Virginia Plan” and this was offered and championed by Edmund Randolph, then Governor and Grand Master of Masons in Virginia. Yet the plan was not entirely Randolph’s nor was it, in essence, Masonic. We can take pride in the fact that many of the cardinal points dealing with in - dividual rights and individual responsibility are a part of both our government ,and our Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"f MENTORS MANUAL Chapter VII General Information There are a few points which should be covered briefly for the benefit of the new Master Mason. These deal with a wide range of material and have been reserved for the last for that reason. The Grand Honors are most frequently given to distinguished brethren on ceremonial occasions as a Masonic salute. This salute is given by striking the palm of the left hand three times with right; the palm of the right is then struck three times with the left; and the palm of the left hand is again st~ruck three times with the right. This is the manner prescribed by the Grand Lodge of Virginia, but the Grand Honors vary from state to state and there is no partictilar uniformity in this custom. Custom in Virginia decrees that the Grand Honors or the Masonic Salute shall be given to the Worshipful Masters of Lodges, the District Deputy Grand Masters, the Grand Lodge Officers, the Grand Master, and the Past Grand Masters when these are received in the East of any Lodge by the Worshipful Master or other brother presiding over a Masonic meeting which is tiled. It is also customary to greet any Past Master received by the Worshipful Master for some special purpose, but the Grand Honors are not given to those who have not attained the office of Worshipful Master. There are also the Funeral Grand Honors which differ greatly from the Masonic Salute. These are given twice by the Funeral Lodge, once in the Lodge room and once at the graveside. In the latter in - stance the brethren, with appropriate gestures, proclaim that the deceased brother’s spirit is consigued to God, his memory to their hearts, and his body to the earth. Masonic Jewelry worn by the brethren in the form of rings and lapel emblems is chiefly an American custom. Oar English brethren seldom use the Masonic emblem for ornamentation. Any Mason may use the square and compasses emblem in the form of jewelry for per - sonal adornment as there is no law which forbids their use ex.cept a civil law enacted a few years ago, which forbids the use of emblems of societies to be worn or displayed by one who is not a member. Many brethren inquire as to the proper manner in which the Ma - sonic ring should be worn. Some brethren like to wear the emblem so that the square and compasses are in the same relative position as when the wearer first saw them. Others prefer to wear it so that another person looking at the emblem will see it as it is normally seen ‘1"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"76 V MENTORS MANUAL by brethien in the Lodge. In this instance the compasses have their points away from the wearer. Either way is correct, for the manner in which the ring is worn is a matter of personal choice and there is no law or regulation governing the manner of its display. Learning the Ritual will often appeal to many of our new brethren as they become fascinated by the quaint language and the richness of our work. These brethren will wish to know how they can receive instruction. His desires should be communicated to the Worshipful Master of his Lodge, ‘who should be able to direct him to a proper person to give him instruction. The Grand Lodge Committee on Work is the custodian of out Ritual in Virginia, bot few of the mem - bers of the Committee have sufficient time to give individual instruc - tion. Sonie of our Masonic Districts have District Instructors and these brethren may find time to teach the ritual to the new brother. If not, they will certainly know someone who can. In several sections of Virginia there are classes of instruction in the ritual conducted by Lodges or on a District basis where in - struction in the floor work and lectures may be obtained. The new Mason should be introduced to those in charge of a particular school where these exist. He might find proper instruction from some well - quahfied individual, but before he is turned over to someone for the purpose of receiving instruction, the qualifications of the instructor should be known. Attention of the new brother should be called to the several schools which meet annually. The John T. Cochran Masonic Memorial School meets in July at Augusta Military Academy, at Fort Defiance, near Staunton The Southwest Masonic School meets in August at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg. The Eastern Shore School meets at Ocean Lodge No. 116, Wachapreague, in January. This latter school is on the Eastern Shore but is visited by brethren from eastern Virginia each year. All of the schools last from three to five days and the brethren may obtain instruction under the direction of the Grand Lecturer on any part of the Ritual. Masonic Burial is one of the rights and privileges of a Master Mason This ceremony may be conducted by any Virginia Lodge as a courtesy to another Lodge, if the deceased brother happened to be a sojourner. However, it should be remembered that the Lodge is not supposed to offer this service; the request should originate with the brother during his lifetime or come from a member of his family after he has passed on. Masonic funeral ceremonies are widely used and brethren who desire to include Masonic rites in their final plans 77 MENTORS MANUAL should make their wishes known to their own families or place them in writing so that a knowledge of them may be had. In the case of sojourners, their families should be advised to com - municate with the Worshipful Master or the Secretary of the deceased b?other’s Lodge. The name of the Secretary is usually to be found on the dues card from the Lodge. If it becomes necessary to clear this matter with another Lodge, the Worshipful Master will care for these details. Recommended Reading There are many books on Masonry and Masonic subjects from which the new Mason may acquire knowledge of our Society. Some of these may be borrowed, some may be obtained on loan from the Grand Lodge Library, and others may have to be purchased if the brother wishes to use them. Erich will make its own contribution to his Ma - sonic education. It is n’it possible, in the brief space available, to print a complete list of either books or subjects which are recommended for general reading and study of the subject of Freemasonry. Nor is it possible to list all of the sources from which books niay be ohtained. The following ~s a partial list of books suggested for the brother who w~rihes to do some Masonic reading.

The Orders and Rites of Freemasonry The new Mason will hear much of the so-called “higher degrees” ot Masonry. Each of these has a place in our fraternal system, but it should be understood that the term “higher” is a misnomer if it is assumed to imply superiority. For the benefit of the new Mason an outline of the two “rites” are given as a matter of information. iEach of these is predicated upon membership in a Craft Lodge. ‘78 .7-i"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"80 MENTORS MANUAL MENTORS MANUAL 81 The York Rite consists of the Royal Arch Chapter and the Corn— mandery of Knights Templar. The name York Rite has been used for many years, but it probably should be more properly called the American Rite. The Chapter of Royal Arch Masons consists of six degrees in Virginia, namely those of Mark Master, Past Master, Select and Royal Master (the lasi two being sometimes known as the Cryptic Degrees or Rite), Most Excellent Master and Royal Arch Mason In most States the Council Degrees of Select N’Iaster, Royal Master, and Super Excellent Master are a separate organization known as the Council, and having both subordinate and grand bodies. The Commandery of Knights Templar consists of three Orders and is the only part of Masonry dealing with the Christian religion and requiring a belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ. The Orders are those of Red Cross, Malta and the Temple. The latter two Orders have some foundation in the Crusades. The Scottish Rite consists of twenty-nine degrees which are divided into four separate bodies. ln the Southern Jurisdiction these are styled the Lodge of Perfection, the Chapter of Rose Croix, the Council of Kadosh, and the Consistory. The Scottish Rite Degrees are nuin - bered, beginning with the 40 and running through the 320 and each has a name as well, that of the 320 being Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret. In addition, the Supreme Council, Southern Jurisdiction, has one rank and decoration which is bestowed on deserving brethren who have attained the 320. It is known as Knight Commander, Court of Honor, or K.C.C.H. The Supreme Council also confers the 330, that of Inspector General Honorary, upon certain brethren selected by it at each biennial session. Another distinction which is very rare is that of Grand Cross, bestowed only by the Supreme Council for out - standing contributions to Freemasonry generally, the Scottish Rite, and service to mankind in other fields of human endeavor. The Supreme Council, Northern Masonic Jurisdiction, has bodies in fifteen States north of the Mason-Dixon Line and east of the Mis - sissippi River. It also has 29 degrees, divided into Lodge of Perfection, Council of Princes of Jerusalem, Chapter of Rose Croix, and the Consistory. The Northern Masonic Jurisdiction is governed by a Supreme Council made up of certain officers and an active member from each State. All members of the Supreme Council are 330 Masons. This jurisdiction does not have the rank and decoration of Knight Commander, Court of Honor, but confers the 330 annually on brethren designated to receive it a year earlier. Appendant Orders.—There are numerous appendant Orders which have no actual connection with the Grand Lodge or Masonry as it is generally understood. These are classed as appendant because mem - bership in a Craft Lodge and some of the other bodies is required as a prerequis ito to membership in them. The first of these is the Red Cross of Constantine, which chooees its members from among the Royal Arch Masons of a jurisdiction who conform to such other reasonable requirements as a particular Conclave desires to impose in its by-laws. The Knights, York Cross of Honour, is another of these. To qualify for membership the brother must have served as the presiding officer in each of the four York Rite Bodies, the Lodge, Chapter, Council (which is included in the Chapter in Virginia), and the Commandery. The Holy Royal Arch, Knights Templar Priests or K.T.P.; the Allied Masonic Degrees; the Royal Order of Scotland; and numerous other bodies a~e also numbered among the appendant orders. Membership in all of these is by invitation only. The Shrine, Grotto and Tall Cedars, all fun-loving organizations, may also be classed as appendant groups because each requires Ma - sonic membership as a prerequisite. The Shrine is properly the Ancient Arabic Order, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, and its Temples usually carry Arabic names. The individual Temples are governed by a Potentate, and the parent body—the Imperial Council—is gov - erned by the Imperial Potentate. The Grotto is properly the Mystic Order, Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm, and its Grottos usually cnrry mystic names. The individual Grotto Is governed by a Monarch, and the parent body—the Supreme Council—is governed by the Grand Monarch. The Tall Cedars have the full name of Tall Cedars of Lebanon. The individual Forests are governed by a Grand Tall Cedar, and the parent body—the Supreme Forest, Tall Cedars ~f Lebanon—is governed by the Supreme Grand Tall Cedar. Each of these has its own particular charitable or philanthropic work for which it labors diligently and in which each has achieved national recognition. The Shrine is best loved for its Shriners Hos - pitals for Crippled Children, the “world’s best known philanthropy.” The Grotto has its excellent cancer research program and through it has sponsored some productive studies. The national charitable objective of both the Grotto and the Tall Cedars is research for the cure of muscular dystrophy. Any brother who desires information concerning these organizations or orders may obtain it by asking some member. It is recommended"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"82 MENTORS MANUAL that the young Mason at least learn the fundamentals of the Symbolic Lodge before he attempts to broaden the scope of his Masonic activities to such an extent that he will not have time for the essential elements of our Freemasonry as these are found in it Ladles Organizations.—.Thes~ are not Masonic, nor connected with Freemasonry except for the requirement that the ladies be wine or daughters of Masons In order to qualify for membership and that the men be members of the Craft These are the Order of the Eastern Star, the Order of Amaranth, and the White Shrine of Jerusalem. Each of these does a fine work and full information on any of them may be obtained from any member. Youth Organhzatlons.—Masonic youth organizations in Virginia iaclude the International Order of Job’s Daughters, the Order of the Rainbow for Girls, snd the Order of DeMolay. The Grand Lodge approves the sponsoring of these organizations by our Lodges and the ienderirig of such aid and assistance as may be reason - ably given by the Lodge, such as the providing of meeting rooms, etc. The Bethels of Job’s Daughters are usually under Ihe sponsorship of an Eastern Star Chapter in Virginia. For the Mentor Himself The Committee on Masonic Education will be happy to receive and answer any question which arises in the instruction of any candidate you may be called upon to teach. If you cannot secure the proper answer from your local chairman, simply address the Committee at the Giand Lodge of Virginia, A. F. & A. M., P. 0. Box 27345, Richmond, Va. 23261. A reasonable time should be allowed for your answer to be received. If in the course of your work you have any suggestions for the Improvement of this Manual, the production of other aids to Masonic edueation, or those which will help the Committee with its task, these will be gratefully received and thoroughly studied. Providing proper instruction for our newly-made Masons in order to create a con - tInuing interest in Freemasonry is one of the real problems of our century. We do not have all of the answers and we need all of the help we can get. We therefore appeal to each Mentor for any assist - ance he can give us and for a dedication to the high service to which he has been called.
