Powell Grand Ma ster "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Leaders Resource Handbook A practical resource handbook has been develope d to assist you in leading and managing the affairs of your lodge. The handbook will pr ovide useful information about a variety of topics. Hopefully you will find it to be a valuable resource with beneficial tools for you in fulfilling your duties. Each Lodge is different and every Master is unique in his own way. The information is presented as recommendations for your considerat ion. Take time to study and review the information contained in this resource ma nual. Then share it with other Masonic members and refer to it often. The procedure outlined here is the definitive or ultimate process applicable to a Lodge of any size a nd location. Masonic leaders are encouraged to utilize, as much of the information enclosed to reap the potential benefits available; but by using some of the tools it should prove to be helpful. As Master of your Masonic Lodge, the buck stops with you and you possess the authority to lead and direct the affairs of your lodge. Seize every moment and make everyone around you a success. This is not only your year but also the Lodge’s year to make a difference. How will the year you serve be remembered? The principles that influence how the Lodge is governed are the same as those that guide all organizations. Organizations, large and small, successfully operate only by paying strict attention to the needs, aspirations and concerns of its members. Successful corporations, either fraternal or private, can trace their success directly to the amount of concern that they exhibit for the people they serve. It is important to remember that people make organizations. The management principles contained within this information are designed to assist you in administering the affairs of your Lodge by properly managing yourself and your members, the critical element which constitutes every successful Lodge and every successful Master. No man can accomplish every task that is required to build a vibrant and progressive Lodge. Team Building is the process in which you, as Master, assemble, mold, inspire and direct groups of participants to labor on tasks toward a common and well-defined goal. Your Lodge officers and members are your team. Some are at home, some are sitting on the sidelines waiting and wanting to become involved, and some are energetic and active. The successful Master utilizes each segment of participants to the fullest extent possible. Each officer, every sideliner and even your inactive members must be thoroughly educated in what needs to be accomplished, how it is going to be accomplished and who is going to do the work. To be successful, each of the participants must understand the goal, provide input on how to achieve the goal, and to buy into the plan by recognizing the duties and responsibilities of each team member. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Strategic planning is an absolute necessity to identify opportunities, examine threats, optimize performance and maximize accomplishments during your term as Master. Planning is a process that builds on the cr eativity of the Lodge and assures that participants have an ownershi p interest in the ultimate plan developed. It provides the ability to choose a future rather than being forced into one. It must be written and it must be clearly communicated to ev eryone associated with the Lodge. When done properly, the strategic planning process is a critical st ep in team building for the Lodge currently and for the future. The first step in strategic planning is to consider what the future will be if nothing changes. Things that we need to consider in the forecast include: Membership – Your Internal Customers Finances Programs and Activities Organizational Structure  Leadership Facilities and Equipment External Community Membership. We must determine (a) the number of members, (b) the number of active members, (c) the identities of new members, (d) the age of membership, (e) the number of members residing locally, (f) occupations represented, and (g) potential members. Implement and/or update the members’ da ta and interests records of the Lodge membership. Finances. The sources and amounts of income must be identified along with administrative and program expenses. The pr ogress of planned fund raising events and revenue must be projected. Anticipated expe nses for the Lodge also must be recognized. Programs and Activities. List all program s, projects and activities with known or tentative dates. Include ritual practices and potential degree work. Incorporate information due to the office of Grand Lodge. Organize this list by type, noting the purpose of each. Please save your list and review it often. It is your preliminary planning calendar for your year of service. Organizational Structure. Review the orga nizational chart for the local Lodge focusing particularly on the names and purposes of all appointed committees. Provide a list of potential assigned duties for the committees so the committee chairmen and committee members clearly know their expectations. Leadership. Identify recent, current and potential leaders. Establish what level of training for leadership has been done and is needed. Ascertain the current activities of all committees and the members active on them. Consider in providing a survey to the members to determine their interests and input into the program. Verify how leaders and committee members have been recruited and assigned."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Facilities and Equipment. Identify real estate that is owned by the Lodge and the value of the property. Determine if any repairs or cons truction is desired or anticipated. Establish the condition and value of equipment. Review usage of space and equipment. External Data. Obtain da ta regarding population trends , demographic trends, family trends, association membership trends, competition, and allies. Consider the effect of each of these and social changes on past, present and potential Masonic membership. This forecasting process will tell us that some things in the future are improving or increasing while some things will be getting worse or are decreasing. But most importantly, we must remember that what the future ultimately brings is our decision to make. The second step in the strategic planning process is to identify the distinctive areas that we want to keep and those specific areas where we desire change. This part of the process involves: Ideas  Mission  Goals  Objectives  Action Plans Monitor and Evaluate Ideas. Conduct a planning meeting with the current Master, Wardens, Treasurer, Secretary and a few interested, active members in a suitable meeting place that offers the environment conducive to learn and to exch ange of ideas. The meeting place should provide some relaxation and comfort with satisfactory refreshments. Review the information gathered in step one of the stra tegic planning process. Assign one man to a large flip chart or chalkboard with appropriat e markers. Ask the question, “What is the biggest problem existing within our Lodge?” Allow each participant to list only one response, go around the room and solicit an answer from every individual. Continue around the room numerous times until all-perceived problems are listed. Only then should the group discuss these ideas, list them in priority order, and offer possible solutions or resolution. Mission. Develop a mission statement for your Lodge if you haven’t adopted one. The mission statement should provide a focus for the Master, officers and members to assure that goals being established for the Lodge t eam are consistent with the principles of Freemasonry. It should answer the questions “Why are we here? And “What is our purpose in this community?” and “What be nefits should we provide to members and their families?’ Goals. For each important idea, the group should establish goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time specific. The goals will then be smart goals for"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the Lodge to work for and succeed in their service for the good of the Lodge. Review the specific requirements for the Grand Master’s Award of Excellence and other Grand Lodge programs that are being emphasized by the Grand Master and Kentucky Freemasonry. Objectives. Each goal should generate sp ecific objectives that are understandable, feasible and require action. An objectiv e should state an achievement and assign accountability. Action Items. Action items are generated from objectives. The action item states what task will be done, who will do it, when it w ill be done, where it will be done, and how much it will cost. Add these action items to the preliminary planning calendar developed during the initial stages of strategic planning. Monitor and Evaluate. The Master initiates and retains overall responsibility for assuring that strategic planning is done. He delegates the work to individuals and committees. He ultimately is responsible for creating, approving, monitoring and evaluating the accomplishment of the goals. Implementation of Goals Now that you have determined what your goals are ----what you want to do and where you want to be, the question is how do you ge t there from here? One effective tool in goal setting is to generate some questions that will help you plan more effectively to meet the short term and long term needs of th e Lodge. The following questions could be raised: 1. What are your one-year objectives? 2. What are your three-year objectives? 3. What are the skills and qualifications that are needed? 4. What are you willing to give up to accomplish your objectives? 5. What do you plan to do this month? It is important to answer each question carefully and thoughtfully. Solicit the input and assistance of your officers in some or all of the questions. Your one-year objective(s) should include the time line that you and/or your Lodge have set up for next year. You could also include some personal objectives within this category. As far as the three-year objective is concerned, you will almost assuredl y need the help of your junior officers to complete it (unless you plan on being Master of your lodge for the next three years!) Skills and qualifications that you and/or your l odge will need to carry out these goals are directly related to the goals. For instance, if one of your goals is to your ritual, and you are not a particularly good at ritual, you could write down “seek assistance from a Past Master of the lodge to improve your ritual work. Some of your goa ls may conflict with your current lifestyle or routine activities. That is where number 4 come into play. If we stick to the example above, in order to improve your ritual, you will have to spend some"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"extra time working on it. Perhaps that will mean for you one less night a week in front of the television set or giving up an hour of sleep a night to study your ritual. Finally, it is essential that you take some action immediately to work toward your goals. What are you going to do this month or star t meeting your goals? If increased attendance at meetings is one of them, perhaps this month you need to have a meal before the meeting if you aren’t already doing that, or you could have an interesting educational program. Another option would be to set up a phone-calling tree so that each member is contacted personally and reminde d to come to lodge in conjunction with the Brother to Brother Program. Persistence and consiste ncy are the keys to make a difference in achieving goals. We want to continually be in the habit of working toward our goals to achieve success. After your goals have been identified and you have decided what you want to accomplish this year, you need to establish a time frame for each one. Not only a time line, which is essentially your calendar of events for the year, but an actual deadline for accomplishing each goal. As one motivational speaker puts it, “A goal is a dream with a deadline.” By definition, a goal should be smart – specific, measurable, attainab le, realistic and time specific. For instance you shouldn’t have a goal such as, “I want to have a better year than last year.” A better goal would be, “Our lodge wants to raise $1,000 more this year in the first quarter than we did last year to award two scholarships.” It is specific (increase amount of raising funds) measurable (two scholarships), with a time frame of April 1. The accountability comes in when you compare your actual performance to the goals you set. Another key to successful goal setting is break ing down your goals into smaller portions. The reason for this is that by doing so you will have a quicker resolution and hopefully more immediate gratification. After you ha ve attained your mini-goal of your desired and ultimate goal, you will feel a sense of accomplishment. You experience success sooner and more often, and it eventually becomes a habit! Once you have identified your goals, it is im portant to continually review and update them. Goals aren’t something you just set once and forget about them. They require monitoring. As you go through the year, ask yourself where are you on your path to accomplishing each goal. If you are ahead of schedule, is the goal too easy? Does it need to be revised to keep it a challenge? Conversely, if you are behind schedule, why is that? Do you have a goal that is unattainab le, or are you off-track? If you have a goal that truly is unattainable, change it to something a little more reasonable. You want your goals to be challenging not impossible. One of the most important things to keep in mind is to not try to do everything yourself. Don’t do it during your year as Senior Warden, certainly not as Worshipful Master. It is essential to involve your officers, member s and the entire lodge. When you have your planning session, try to get as many brethren there as possible. The best way to keep a lodge busy and active is to have happy and ac tive members. Few things will have as much success in your attendan ce and activities as keeping your members involved. Give"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"them a genuine interest in what goes on in your lodge by making them feel a part of the planning process. If they feel they have c ontributed to the planning, they will be much more likely to actively participate in seeing those plans implemented successfully. After you have included your members in the planning phase, by all means, don’t stop there. Keep them as involved and interested as possible in the execution of those plans. When you sit in the East, don’t try to assume all of the duties, problems, opportunities, etc. all by yourself. Appoint committees, and le t them perform tasks at hand. Have the committee chairmen report at the lodge meeti ngs and take action on their proposals and recommendations. Don’t undermine the responsibility of the chairmen by rehashing the work of the committees at your meetings. Keep that spirit and spark energized by keeping your members involved, active and happy. One of the most important tools to use to make your goals become reality can be said in one simple word – Preparation. The Master sets the pace, the example and should always be prepared. Remember the seven P’s to pl anning and preparation. Those P’s include prior proper planning or preparation prevents pitiful poor performance. The Master, and probably the Wardens as well, should arrive at least one half hour before the stated time to prepare for the evening’s business/activities. Few things will have more of a negative impact on attendance than a disorganized mee ting. Officers meetings should be held prior to the lodge meeting or well in advance of the stated meeting to know how to prepare for the agenda of the stated meeting. The Master should review all the items of business with his Wardens and his committee chairmen. He should make sure that the committee chairmen are ready to present clear, concise reports so that the lodge doesn’t have to rehash the business that the committ ees have or should have discussed. As Senior Warden, you will likely be the chairman of a number of committees. You can assist your Master by being fully prepared to report. Likewise, you will be doing yourself a favor by setting a good example for your Junior Warden to follow next year. In conclusion, keep in mind that it is important to establish effective goals, those that are specific, measurable and have a deadline. Use the five-step process for laying the groundwork for your success. Determine what your one and three year objectives are, the skills that you will need to accomplish them, what you’re willing to sacrifice to make those objectives become reality, and what you will do right now to get started. Break down your major goals into smaller portions that allow you to experience success on a smaller but much more immediate basis. Utilize the talents and skills of your brethren in these goals and establishing a timeline for your year in the East. Constantly review your goals to make sure that you are staying on track, ensuring that the goals you originally set are challenging but realistic. Finally, remember that the goal setting and implementation process is an important and ongoing one. If you don’t know exactly what you want to do and when you want it done by, chances are you will do nothing. Good Luck! "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" LEADER VS. MANAGER Let’s look at the differences with a Master of the lodge who employs management skills compared to leadership qualities in running lodge operations. The leader does the right thing while the manager does things right. The leader builds a team and pursues innovati on, while the manager administers the same tried programs. The leader seeks the benefits of change and advancement, while the manager searches for the comfort of conti nuity and conformity. The leader focuses on people and outcomes, wh ile the manager directs his attention to process and procedure. The leader is concerned with empowering the Lodge to move forward while the manager is content to maintain the lodge at status quo. The leader looks for opportunities to empower his team and transform the lodge, while the manager avoids the pot ential friction of growth. The leader involves all members to develop direction for the Lodge, while the manager gives directions to the members. The leader leads by personal power earned through demonstrated commitment, while the manager manages ba sed solely upon the power of position.

You may wonder at times if you are capable of being a leader. One thing is certain, you have the ability. Leadership traits and skills must be developed by conscientious effort. We are not born leaders! How do you rate yourself on the following list of skills for successful leadership? 1. LOYALTY. The surest way to gain loyalty and respect is to be loyal to the organization, officers, and to the members. 2. GENUINE INTEREST IN PEOPLE. This is doubly important in Masonic fellowship. Be warm, human, concerned with their opinions, families and problems. 3. INITIATIVE. Look for better ways to do things. 4. DECISIVENESS. If a problem takes study--- arrange for the time but don’t let it get lost. Don’t stall, put off or evade the issue. Accept the responsibility that is given to you and act. 5. POSITIVE THINKING. Think how things CAN be done, not why they CANNOT. Try to look for the good in everyone and everything. Be ENTHUSIASTIC about your Masonic lodge. 6. TACT AND COURTESY. Be thoughtful of others and have regard for their feelings. Treat all officers and members with respect always. 7. FAIRNESS. Be objective when considering an idea – ask “Will it help the lodge?” not, “What do I think?” 8. INTEGRITY. Be dependable, sincere and consistent all the time. Let the members know that you are for honesty – and where you stand. Your actions speak higher than your words. 9. QUIET AGGRESSIVENESS. Gently push for what you feel your part of the program ought to be based on – the goals and objectives of the Grand Lodge programs and the needs of the Lodge. Don’t be afraid to sell your ideas, but don’t crush others in the process. 10. HUMILITY. All of us should remember that no one is perfect and that we are human. Most of our organizational successes depend on many are working together. Be free in showing recognition for what others do. We can learn from all ages and other gene rations at all times. 11. TEACHING ABILITY. Learn and practice the art of good public speaking. Study carefully what the organizational pl an is for your Masonic lodge and then instruct your members in the whole plan. Give each member a chance to help and contribute for the good of the lodge. 12. FRIENDLY PERSONALITY. A ready smile makes people feel at home. Kindness and friendliness are contagious.

C) Gets Action The very nature of modern leadership requires persuasion; the response to the leader; measured by and in the action of those being led is how action is gauged. D) Gets Results The movement of truth in leadership is the achievement of results. It is the guiding force of human energy in a definite direction for a specific purpose. It is both the aiming and the shooting that determines whether or not you hit the target. 2) BASIC STEPS IN LEADERSHIP A) Planning This step is primarily a problem solving process, considering the alternatives, establishing relating facts in advance, in order to achieve certain results or goals. B) Organizing Considering the job, the people, and the place. C) Motivating Furnishing others with the desire to perform in accordance with the plan. Leadership motivates; communication is the key to good motivation. D) Controlling This is the following of the plan. The coordination, timing, and supervision that provide the econom y and efficiency that make for an well-organized activity. 3) FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEADERSHIP A) Confidence If a leader does not believe in himself, no one else will. B) Energy A leader must be willing to do everything he asks of his followers, and more. C) Timing This is a combination of alertness, imagination and foresight. D) Clarity A leader must be able to reason logically, weigh alternatives, make decisions and then convey his thoughts lucidly. E) Tenacity This is the capacity to hang on longer than expected. An effective leader not only must have this ability himself, but must also inspire it in others. F) Boldness A willingness to take chances, a readiness to experiment, a soaring optimism that rejects and despises the thought of failure. G) Concern People will never follow a leader unless they feel that he really cares about them and their problems."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"H) Morality Without a stern code of ethics, a strong sense of personal morality; a man is too unsure of himself to be an effective leader. I) Faith Above all, a leader must believe in his people, as well as in the goal toward which he is leading them. J) Common Sense The ability of reducing a complex problem to its simplest terms. It is a leadership trait that can be developed by observing common sense in others and by learning from their, and your own, mistakes. K) Knowing One’s Own Field People who are going to be good leaders need to have practical understanding of the crafts of their business. The learning process continues even after major peaks have been scaled. You must work to keep your edge. L) Self-Reliance Includes willpower and the ability to set goals. It encompasses the ability to be a self-starter and to persevere after a project has begun. M) General Intelligence An inquiring mind and broad ranging interests are fundamental to success. N) The Ability to Get Things Done Efficiency in accomplishing your task. 4) ESTABLISHING GOOD LEADERSHIP A) Leadership is established by winning the respect, confidence, and loyalty of subordinates and the esteem of superiors. In a sense, the leader must be a salesman. He must sell himself to others. 5) GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF SUBORDINATES A) Understanding Your Co-workers The better you understand them, the better you can help them. The fact th at they elected you for their leader shows that they have confidence in you. B) Expect Good Work Let your subordinates know what is expected from them and give them some help in getting started. Do not accept work that is poor in quality, by doing so shows your approval. Future work will be that much harder to correct. C) Acknowledge Good Work Praise is appealing to the basic human need to feel important. Praising publicly has extra value. It raises morale, standing, and self-confidence. Others are put on notice that good work is observed and this will encourage them in their own work. D) Give Credit for Good Ideas Tell the individual and others. Make sure superiors are aware of the origin of the idea and that the author receives due credit.

Make sure your story answers the basic journalistic questions – who, what, where, when, why and how. Be sure your message is newsworthy. Read th e publications, listen to the radio, and view television news and talk shows. If your story seems similar to the kind of material used, there’s a good chance your news will be used, too. Submit your information well in advance – up to three weeks in advance if possible. Check and double-check all the information, spelling of names, etc. Be brief. Avoid opinionated language and flowery prose. A news release usually runs between one and two pages long. Write in the present and future tenses. Old news is dead news. If the media wishes to cover your function, they will decide. Y our job is to inform them in advance. Write in inverted pyramid style, placing f acts in descending order of importance. If editors need to cut information, they “cut from the bottom.” End every news release with a position statement that clearly identifies who you are. Place photo or video opportunity suggestions following the body of your release. The media will contact you if they want to send a photographer or camera crew. Type your release error free! It should be typed double-spaced with contact information (including telephone number) at the top of pa ge. Also put a release date or “For Immediate Release” at the top. Ma rgins should be at least 1” wide. Handle fact sheets in a similar way. However, type fact sheet information in a single- spaced outline style, with double-spacing between lines. Use the basic journalistic questions as your guide.

CONCLUS ION"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"KENTUCKY MASONIC FAMILIES The York Rite The York Rite of Freemasonry has been an integral part of Freemasonry in Kentucky. The York Rite is not the name of a separate organization; it is a title given to the bodies of the Capitular, Cryptic and Templar Rites and is a symbol of the antiquity of Freemasonry. In Kentucky, the Grand Bodies of these Rites work closely together in a York Rite Council whose membership consists of the elected officers in each Rite. The Rite consists of the three separate organizations linked together by their teachings which are successive and progress from the symb olic lodge through the Royal Arch Chapter, the Council of Royal and Select Masters to the Commandery of Knights Templar. While the symbolic Grand Lodge has celebrated over 200 years in the Commonwealth, the three Grand York Bodies have only a slightly shorter history in Kentucky. The Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons organized in Lexington in 1817 now has 56 Royal Arch Chapters and over 5,436 Royal Arch Masons. The Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters began its work in Frankfort in 1827 and it has 41 Councils with over 4,433 Select Masters. The Grand Commandery of Knights Templar was chartered by the Grand Encampment of the Unites States in 1847 and it supervises 34 subordinate Commanderies with nearly 4,398 members. A Master Mason petitions and is elected to receive the degrees and orders of the Rite. The Rite confers 4 degrees in Chapter or Capitular Masonry – Mark Master, Past Master Most Excellent Master and the Royal Arch Degree; 3 degrees in Council or Cryptic Masonry – Royal Master, Select Master and Super Excellent Master, and 3 orders in Chivalric or Templar Masonry – the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross, the Order of Malta and the Order of the Temple. All York Rite Masons contribute regularly to Masonic-related charities and youth groups. Since its conception in 1974, Royal Arch Research Assistance (R.A.R.A.) has been the world’s leading philantrophy dedicated to helping children with Central Auditory Processing Disorders. R.A.R.A. through the contributions of the General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, International and individual Royal Arch Masons, support is given for Central Auditory Research, where continuous efforts are being made to understand and treat individuals with Central Auditory Processing Disorders. For more than a decade, the Cryptic Masons Medical Research Foundation has supported atherosclerosis research at the Indiana School of Medicine, a national leader in the study of heart disease. Support goes to talented young physicians and scientists, enabling them to better understand the root causes of atherosclerosis. Conducting research at a major university medical center yields significant benefits. The Knights Templar Eye Foundation is internationally known for its contributions to medical research on blindness and for its aid to the blind in paying for medical treatment that will regain the sight of those unable to afford it. Almost one million dollars has been spent in Kentucky by this foundation to cure blindness. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"There is a Knights Templar Education Foundation that provides low interest loans and scholarships to deserving students who would be unable to attend technical schools or college without the aid. As highlighted, the York Rite in Kentucky is still a living, growing part of Freemasonry in this Commonwealth. Ancient & Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry The organization known as “The Scottish Rite” consists of Master Masons joined together to extend their study, association and activities in Freemasonry. The ceremonies of Freemasonry and its philosophy are contained in the first three degrees. The similar degrees of Scottish Rite has been conferred in Louisiana with Grand Lodge approval in recognition of the principle that this is the proper function of the Symbolic or Blue Lodge. Therefore, the Scottish Rite confers degrees from the Fourth through the Thirty-Second. The Thirty-Third Degree is conferred upon Thirty-Second Degree Masons who have rendered outstanding service to the community, to society and/or to Freemasonry. The Thirty-Third Degree is an “Honorary Degree” since one cannot petition for it in the same manner as one petitions for the preceding degrees and also, the members who receive the Thirty-Third Degree become Honorary Members of the Supreme Council. Scottish Rite Freemasonry came to Kentucky when the Grand Consistory, Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite was organized in Louisville on August 20, 1852, with eight charter members. Today, additional Scottish Rite Bodies are located in their respective Valleys in Covington, chartered in 1877, Madisonville, chartered in 1963 and Lexington, chartered in 1971. Scottish Rite membership is nearly 10,000 members. The original eight members trying to diffuse the true, genuine Masonry of the Scottish Rite met with much discouragement and the movement existed for the most part in name only until peace was restored after the Civil War. Very few members were received into the organization and no degrees were conferred. Starting in 1866, however, much interest was manifested in Masonry and the Scottish Rite since that time has been a most active part of Kentucky Freemasonry. Early meetings of the Grand Consistory of Kentucky, A.&A.S.R., were held in the Masonic Temple, Fifth & Liberty Streets (1852-1876). The Grand Consistory moved to the old Courier Journal Building, located at Third and Jefferson (1877-1883), it was located in the Masonic Temple at Fourth and Jefferson (1883-1885). In 1894, The Scottish Rite purchased the St. Paul’s Episcopal Church at Sixth and Walnut Streets, the building was ren amed “The Sco ttish Rite Cathedral”, it was home for the Fraternity until 1923. In 1923-24, the Schubert Building on Chestnut between 3 rd and 4 th Streets was home, it moved to Preston Lodge No. 281 Masonic Hall, on Broadway in April 1924, in April 1925 it moved to DeMolay Hall at 212 West Broadway and occupied a part of that building until it moved into its present home at Brook and Gray Streets. The Grand Master and Grand Lodge Officers of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky, F. & A.M dedicated the beautiful Scottish Rite Temple of Grecian architecture in August 1930. In 1971 the Grand Consistory of Kentucky, by Charter of the Supreme Council, became the Louisville Scottish Rite Bodies of Freemasonry. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Many dedicated men and Masons have contributed much to the success of Scottish Rite Freemasonry in Kentucky. Space does not permit a detailed biography of each of them. Among the many prominent Kentuckians who held membership in the Scottish Rite was John Cabell Breckinridge, who was the first Sovereign Grand Inspector General in Kentucky for the Supreme Council whose headquarters are in The House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. He was elected Vice-President of the United States in 1856, serving from 1857-1861; at the time of his election he was thirty-five years old, the youngest Vice-President in the Nation’s history. As a Presidential Candidate in 1860 he r eceived a total of 82 electoral votes. Seven men have guided the destiny of the Scottish Rite in Kentucky as Sovereign Grand Inspector Generals. Frederick Webber (1859-1875) and John H. Cowles (1909-1954) followed Breckinridge. Both Webber and Cowles held high positions in The Supreme Council. Cowles served as Grand Commander for thirty-one years, he was a Past Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky. The Fourth, Fifth and Sixth respectively were Judge Stephen S. Jones (1955- 1960), Charles J. Weber (1963-1970) and George R. Effinger (1973-1989). Effinger served the Supreme Council as Grand Almoner and is a Past Grand Master of Masons in Kentucky. Presently serving as Sovereign Grand Inspector General in Kentucky, elected by the Supreme Council in 1991 is John E. Moyers, a member of the Louisville Scottish Rite Bodies of Freemasonry and a Past Grand Master of Kentucky, Free and Accepted Masons. He currently serves the Supreme Council as Grand Secretary General. The Scottish Rite Creed The cause of human progress is our cause, the enfranchisement of human thought our supreme wish, the freedom of human conscience our mission, and the guarantee of equal rights to all peoples everywhere the end of our contention. Order of the Eastern Star The Grand Chapter of Kentucky, Order of the Eastern Star was organized at a special session of the General Grand Chapter in Louisville, Kentucky, June 10, 1903. Mrs. Katie I. Thomas of Dora Chapter No. 2, Dayton, Kentucky was the first Worthy Grand Matron. R.H. Crothers of Bright Star No. 16, Louisville, Kentucky was the first Worthy Grand Patron. Twenty Chapters had previously been organized under the General Grand Chapter and these constituted the Grand Chapter of Kentucky. Dr. Rob Morris, the Founder of the Order of the Eastern Star, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, August 31, 1818. He became a lawyer, lecturer, educator and instructor in Masonry. He became a Master Mason in 1849 and soon became interested in the idea that the female relatives of Master Masons should share in a measure of the benefits of this great Fraternal Order. Imbued with this desire, he sought to found an Order which would benefit both men and women. Dr. Morris served as Grand Master for the Grand Lodge of Kentucky in 1858-59. The membership of the Order of the Eastern Star consists of Master Masons and the wives, widows, daughters, mothers and sisters of Master Masons. The first General Grand Chapter was organized on November 16, 1876 in Indianapolis, Indiana. Dr. Morris spent the last twenty-six years of his life in LaGrange, Kentucky, where his family was reared and educated. His home is now the property of the Grand Chapter of Kentucky and is"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"maintained as a Shrine in honor of the Master Builder of the Order. A pilgrimage is made each year to honor this distinguished Mason. On July 31, 1888, when the sad news of his death was sent to all parts of the world, profound grief was expressed at his passing, as his whole life had been devoted to the uplifting of humanity. He was buried in the cemetery in LaGrange, Kentucky, where admiring friends from all over the world have erected a tall marble shaft in his memory. On one side of the shaft is a Square and Compasses and on the other side is the Five Pointed Star. Kentucky has given two presiding officers to this worldwide organization. Mrs. Clara Henrich of Dora Chapter No. 2, Dayton, Kentucky, served from 1925 to 1927. Mrs. Henrich died on her world tour in China from smallpox before her term ended. Mrs. Josephine Harkins Browning of Prestonsburg, Kentucky served the General Grand Chapter from 1964 to 1967. Her knowledge and understanding of our Order was the pride of the membership, not only of Kentucky, but also throughout the United States. Currently, Brother Michael E. Berry of Bright Star No. 16, Louisville, Kentucky is serving as an elective officer in the capacity of General Grand Trustee with the General Grand Chapter. A home is maintained for the aging members of the Order. It is known as the Eastern Star Home of Kentucky and is located at 923 Eastern Star Court in Louisville. A scholarship fund is maintained for religious education of those who are preparing themselves for this special training. Several awards are given each year to the college or seminary where these students are enrolled. Cancer Research is one of the special objectives of the Order. Each year the current Worthy Grand Matron presents an objective which contributes to the welfare of mankind. All of the youth organizations associated with Masonry are on their priority list. Rainbow, Job’s Daughters, DeMolay and the Builders have their sponsorship at all times. Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem The Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem is a Masonic fraternal organization with shrines in the United States and Canada. The Ritual of the Order is founded upon the birth, life and death of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. In the initiation ceremony, the officers tell the story in short scenes’ wearing costumes and assisted by slides and other props. The teachings are Scriptural. Membership in the Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem consists of Master Masons and women related to Master Masons. Candidates must confess a belief in the Christian Religion. The Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem is an incorporated non-profit body, organized under a Charter of Incorporation dated October 23, 1894 and recorded in Illinois, June 18, 1895. The Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem came into existence in Kentucky when Louisville Shrine No. 1 was organized on April 11, 1912. Presently, there are five Shrines throughout the Commonwealth. The subordinate Shrines are organized under the Supreme Shrine. The Material Objective Fund of the Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem is a source of help for people in need of assistance with medical bills regardless of race, creed or sect. An elected board"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"of five administers the fund. Each year over a quarter of a million dollars of assistance is rendered. The Order is looking for people who need this type of help. Contact the Worthy Scribe of one of the subordinate Shrines for forms and information if you know someone in need of assistance with medical bills. Order of the Amaranth The Order of the Amaranth is one of the oldest Orders to be affiliated with the Masonic Fraternity. During the reign of Queen Christina of Sweden, the Order of the Amaranth was established for Ladies and Knights of her Royal Court. It was built around the character of Lady Amarantha, who was portrayed as being a beautiful, virtuous and talented Lady of the Court. The name of the Order was probably chosen because of the beautiful, never-fading red Amaranthus flowers growing in profusion in Spain and Portugal. The Order was perpetuated and exists in the Royal Court of Sweden. It is an international organization with courts in England, Ireland, Scotland, Canada, New South Wales, Queensland and the Philippines, as well as most of the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. Their major international philanthropic project is the Amaranth Diabetes Research Foundation. It is affiliated with the American Diabetes Association and has contributed several million dollars. The Order was organized in Kentucky in 1947 and remains as beautiful as when it was originated. The Order of the Amaranth is an organization for men and women of Masonic families. It is the royalty of service to humanity set to music of fraternal love. When you walk into the court room of the Amaranth, there is the Flag of your Country. The Amaranth opens with the simple sublime words of the World’s Redeemer, used by Him when He gave us the Lord’s Prayer. When the Royal Matron is installed, in order to keep the Order associated as closely as possible with the Word of the Master, the Holy Bible is placed in her care. The teachings of the Order are Truth, Faith, Wisdom and Charity. The greatest of these is charity as an insurmountable amount has been raised for this charitable work. High Twelve International High Twelve International was organized by E.C. Wolcott in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1921. From an original group of around a dozen, this Masonic-oriented body has grown over the years. Headquarters are in St. Louis, Missouri. Many “greats” have been or are High Twelvians – Grand Lodge Grand Masters, military leaders, legislators, professional men, etc. The basic ingredients follow the civic club patterns of programs and principles – good fellowship and Masonic association. A member must be a Master Mason. High Twelve has a variety of local projects, mostly on the charitable and civic service side; its chief indulgence, however, is the Wolcott Foundation, Inc., which was organized in 1945 to underwrite the cost of sending qualified young people as students in government to George Washington University, Washington, D.C. for training as career people. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Most of the clubs meets for luncheon, while dinner programs are quite popular in some parts of the country. The idea is to inform and keep informed relative to community affairs and needs through the use of speakers and educational presentations. The Downtown High Twelve Club of Louisville, Inc., #105 was chartered on May 23, 1947. The Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine In August 1870 William J. Florence, a prominent American actor traveling in Europe, was enthralled by a magnificent pageant presented by a Counsel from Egypt in Marseilles, France. Mr. Florence related this experience to his personal friend, Dr. Walker M. Fleming, in New York. Dr. Fleming was a noted Masonic scholar, and he utilized this ability plus his knowledge of Arabian and Egyptian literature to contrive a ritual. This brilliant physician sp aced mystery and enchantment through the manuscript and in submitting it to actor Florence and eleven other distinguished men, explained that it was his desire to form an order that would act to relax and appeal to the humoresque portion of human nature after being subjected to the continuous serious presentation of the Knight Templar Orders and Scottish Rite Degrees. The prerequisite to join as members would be Master Masons of the Masonic fraternity. The first “Temple” was founded in New York on September 26, 1872 and named “Mecca.” Through rapid growth, the National Order was founded June 6, 1876. On June 25, 1888, Rameses Temple in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was chartered and the Order became the “Shrine of North America.” The name “Imperial” was adopted to signify the International Order. In Kentucky, Temples were chartered as follows: Kosair in Louisville in 1886; El Hasa in Ashland in 1906; Oleika in Lexington in 1908; Rizpah in Madisonville in 1909. The Shrine held annual conventions and for the first fifty years fun and fellowship were the only net results. With the passing of World War I, the men who composed the membership of the Shrine geared their activities toward deeds of more exalted usefulness. At the Imperial Shrine Session held in Portland, Oregon in June 1920, the Shrine “found its soul.” The representatives authorized the formation of the “Shriners’ Hospitals for Crippled Children,” to be supported by an annual assessment of each Noble. The first hospital for the treatment of orthopedically handicapped children was opened by the Shrine at Shreveport, Louisiana on September 16, 1922. The Lexington, Kentucky unit was opened November 1, 1926. The Shrine operates 19 Orthopedic Hospitals and three Burns Institutes, the first of which was opened in Galveston, Texas on March 20, 1966. Just as the Shrine has made America conscious of the crippled child, it is now performing the same humanitarian act in the fields of treatment and research of burned children. The tremendous financial load of the Shriners Orthopedic and Burns programs of today must necessarily be s uppl emented by income in ad dition to the assessment of each Shriner. Fo otball games, circuses, paper sales and other projects are conducted annually for this great charitable undertaking. Wills, bequests and the “Living Trust” are earnestly solicited from all friends of mankind. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Shriners Hospitals for Children have zealously earned and cau tiously protect the proud title of “THE WORLDS’S GREATEST PHILANTHROPHY.” Supreme Council of the Grottos of North America The Supreme Council of the Grottos of North America was organized at Hamilton, New York on June 13, 1890. Aahmed Grotto M.O.V.P.E.R. was instituted December 5, 1941 in the office of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky. Its prime purpose is research into the cause of and treatment for Cerebral Palsy plus Dentistry for the Handicapped. We have made an effort through the dental program to enable dentists to specialize in dentistry for the handicapped child. We have sent children to the dental clinic, at no cost to their parents. The HANDICAPPED Child can be TREATED – and this can be done through Aahmed Grotto."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" MASONIC YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS Order of Rainbow The International Order of the Rainbow for Girls got its beginning in McAlester, Oklahoma on April 6, 1922. The founder the Rev. W. Mark Sexson, A Christian Minister, felt an organization for teenage girls from Masonic and Eastern Star Homes was needed. It would also admit the girl friends of a girl from a Masonic or Eastern Star Home. Mr. Sexson wrote the Ritual and the laws forming the Supreme or governing body. Rainbow has spread to over 47 states, Germany, Canal Zone, Philippines, Japan, Free China, Australia, Canada, Brazil and Italy. Kentucky Rainbow can be proud of the fact that many former members have made outstanding contributions to our Commonwealth – judges, lawyers, doctors, corporate executives, dentists, nurses and good citizens for our Country. Rainbow has assemblies located throughout the Commonwealth. Rainbow has grown in size and numbers, but also in its purpose to always be of service to others. Order of DeMolay The Order of DeMolay is the Masonic sponsored organization for young men, with the purpose of creating leaders through the development of character. DeMolay members, ages 12 to 21, are offered a wholesome occupation for their spare time, worthwhile associates, and a complete program of all-around youth development. The Order of DeMolay not only provides meaningful activities for young men of today, but also teaches respect to church, school country and home. The basic ideals included in these teach ings are filial love, reverence, courtesy, comradeship, fidelity, cleanness and patriotism. The Order of DeMolay is an international organization and over three million young men have passed through its ranks since the Order’s founding in 1919 by Frank Sherman Land. It continues to offer young men a challenging and rewarding environment just as it did in the early years of the organization. The Order reached Kentucky in 1921 with the institution of Daniel Boone Chapter in Louisville. Kentucky has several chapters located throughout the state. Kentucky Masons have provided not only a home for Kentucky DeMolay but also the examples of Masonry and a better manhood – good guides to the young men of the Order of DeMolay. Order of Job’s Daughters From the Book of Job in the Holy Scriptures, we read, “And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job, “This is the main passage upon which the International Order of Job’s Daughters, founded in 1920 by Mrs. Ethel T. Wead Mick, is based. The members of this organization are taught in the lessons, which are taken from the Book of Job, that this “fairness” is achieved through acts of beauty and goodness. The Order was founded with the purpose of bringing together young ladies between the ages of 11 to 20 and of Masonic relationship for character building through moral and spiritual"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"development by teach ing a greater reverence for God and the Holy Bible , loyalty to the Flag and our Country for which it stands, and respect for parents and guardians. The International Order of Job’s Daughters is operated in a democratic manner with adult workers known as the Bethel Guardian Council elected yearly by the Daughters of each Bethel. These adults must be Master Masons or women over the age of twenty with Masonic relationship, a stipulation which ties Job's’ Daughters even more closely to the Masonic fraternity. Through the study of the life of Job, the Order teaches the importance of such virtues as innocence, piety, modesty and straight forwardness in the journey of life. These virtues are the Fundamental Principles of Masonry. The Daughters are also taught basic qualities such as loyalty and dedication by the learning and teaching of the Ritualistic work of the Order and through the acceptance of res ponsibility in the various and elective and appointive offices in the Bethel. The philantrophic project of the International Order of Job’s Daughters is HIKE which stands for Hearing-Impaired Kids Endowment. The Daughters raise funds through the year to buy hearing assistance devices for children with hearing impairments. The long white Grecian robes worn by the Daughters and the jeweled Crowns and Royal Purple Velvet Capes, worn by the three principal officers – the Honored Queen, Senior and Junior Princesses – add to the beauty and dignity of the Ritualistic ceremonies. Through the dedication of the Daughters, Masons and related adults who are devoted to the development of youth, and with special emphasis being pl aced on the virtues and qual ities which make Masonry what it is today. The International Order of Job’s Daughters exerts an outstanding influence on the young womanhood of tomorrow. Order of the Builders In regards to the Builders, Arthur M. Millard founded the original Order of the Builders in Chicago, Illinois on March 2, 1921. The organization is for young men between the ages of 11 and 21 who are the sons, brothers, grandsons or nephews of members or regularly constituted Masonic lodges and their immediate or closest boyhood friends. Master Masons may become Associate Members and be a part of the chapter’s Advisory Council of Master Masons. There are two degrees in the ritual of the Order, the Apprentice Degree and the Builders Degree. Both degrees teach important lessons about the principles of democracy and the ideals of Freemasonry. Builder activities are determined by the members at their regular chapter meetings and may include a wide range of social, athletic, fundraising and civic service projects. Members from Pennsylvania and Illinois instituted Kentucky Chapter on October 29, 1995. The Order has exclusive territorial jurisdiction within the Commonwealth of Kentucky. However, it is in fraternal accord with Pennsylvania and Illinois Builders. Each chapter has fifteen officers and the presiding officer of a chapter is called the Master Builder. The eight elective officers must be chosen from among the junior members. The seven appointive officers can be either junior members or associate members.
