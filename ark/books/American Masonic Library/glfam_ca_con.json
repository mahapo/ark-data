That the privileges of lv4asonry should no longer be restricted to operative Masons, but extend to men of variona professions provided they are reg - ularly approved and Initiated into the Order. THE REGULATION OF 1717. That the privilege of assembling as Masons, whIch had been hitherto unlimited, should be vested in certain Lodges or assemblies of Masons, convened in certain places; and that every Lodge to be hereafter convened, except the four old Lodges at this time existing, should be legally authorized to act by a warrant from the Grand Master for the time being, granted to certain in - dividuals by petition, with the consent and appro - bation of the Grand Lodge in communication; and that without such warrant, no Lodge should be hereafter deemed regular or conslitutional. THE REGULATION OF 1720. In future, the new Grand Master shall be named and proposed to the Grand Lodge sometime before the feast; and, if approved and present, he shall be saluted as Grand Maeter elect; and every Grand Master, when he is installed, shall have the sole power of appointing his Deputy and Wardens, according to ancient custom. THE CHARGES APPROVED IN 1772. 1. Concerning God and Religion. A Mason is obliged by his tenure, to obey the moral law; and if he rightly understands the art, he will never be a stupid atheist, nor an irreligious libertine. But though In ancient times Masons were charged in every country to be of the religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, yet it is now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves; that is, to be good men and true, or men of honor and honesty, by whatever denominations or persua - sions they may be distinguished; whereby Ma. sonry becomes the centre of union, and the means of conciliating true friendship among persons that must else have remained at a perpetual distance. II. Of the Civil Magistrate, Supreme and Subordinate. A Mason is to be a peaceful subject to the cIvil powers, wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in plots and conspiracies, against the peace and welfare of the nation, nor to behave himself, undutifully to inferior magis - trates; for as Masonry hath been always injured by war, bloodshed and confusion, so ancient kings and princes have been much disposed to encourage the craftsmen, because of their peaceableness and loyalty, whereby they practically answered the cavila of their adversaries and promoted the honor 01 the Fraternity, which ever flourished in times of peace. So that if a brother should be a rebel against the State, he is not to be contenanced in his rebellion, however, he may be pitied as an unhappy man; and, if convicted of no other crime, though the loyal brotherhood must and ought to disown his rebellion, and give no umbrage or ground of political jealousy to the government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his relation to its remains Indefeasible. 28 29"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"III. Of Lodges. A Lodge Is a place where Masons assemble and work: Hence, that assembly, or duly organized society of Masons is called a Lodge, and every brother ought to belong to one, and be subject to its by-laws and general regulations. It is either particular or general, and will be best understood by attending it, and by the regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annexed. In ancient times, no Master or Fellow could be ab - sent from it, especially when warned to appear at it, without incurring a severe censure, until it appeared to the Master and Wardens, that pure necessity hindered him. The persons admitted members of a Lodge must be good and true men, free-born, and of mature and discreet age, no bondmen, no women, no Im - moral, or scandalous men, but of good report. IV. Of Masters, Wardens, Fellows and Apprentice.. All preferment among 1\\i asons is grounded upon real worth and personal merit only; that so the lords may be well served, the brethren not put to shame, nor the Royal Craft despised. Therefore, no Master or Warden is chosen by seniority, but for his merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every brother must attend in his place, and learn them in a way peculiar to this fraternity: Only candidates may know, that no Master should take an Apprentice, unless he has sufficient employment for him, and unless he be a perfect youth, having no maim or defect in his body, that may render him incapable of learn - ing the art, of serving his l\\iaster’s lord, and of being made a brother, and then a Fellow Craft in due time, even after he has served such a term of years as the custom of the country directs; and that he should be descended of honest parents; that so, when otherwise qualified, he may arrive to the honor of being the Warden, and then the Mas - ter of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Master of all the Lodges, according to his merit. No brother can be Warden until he has passed the part of a Fellow Craft; or a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand Warden until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor Grand Master unless he has been a Fellow Craft before his elec - tion, who is also to be nobly born, or a gentleman of the best fashion, or some eminent scholar, or some curious architect, or other artist, descended of honest parents, and who is of singular great merit in the opinion of the Lodges. And for the better and easier and more honorable discharge of his office, the Grand Master has a power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a par - ticular Lodge, and has the privilege of acting whatever the Grand Master, his principal, should act, unless the said principal be present, or inter - pose his authority by a letter. These rulers and governors, supreme and sub - ordinate, of the Ancient Lodge, are to be obeyed in their respective stations by all the brethren, ac - cordIng to the old charges and regulations, with all humility, reverence, love and alacrity. V. Of the management of the Craft in Working. All masons shall work honestly on working days, that they may live creditably on holy days; and the time appointed by the law of the land or con - firmed by custom, shall be observed. 31"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"r The most expert of the Fellow Craftsmen shall be appointed the Master, or Overseer of the lord’s work, who is to be called l~iaster by those that work under him. The Craftsmen are to avoid all ill language, and to call each other by no disoblig - ing name, but brother or fellow; and to hehave themselves courteously within and without the Lodge. The Master, knowing himself to be able of cun - ning, shall undertake the lord’s work as reason - ably as possible, and truly dispend his goods as if they were his own; nor to give more wages to any brother or appentice than he really may deserve. Both the Master and the Masons, receiving their wages justly, shall be faithful to the lord, and honestly finish their work, whether task or jour - ney; nor put the work to task, that bath been accustomed to journey. None shall discover envy at the prosperity of a hrother, nor supplant him or put him out of hIs work, if he be capable to finish the same; for no man can finish another’s work so much to the lord’s profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the designs and drafts of him that began it. When a Fellow Craftsman is chosen Warden of the work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fellows, shall carefully oversee the work in the Master’s absence, to the lord’s profit and his brethren shall obey him. All Masons employed shall meekly receive their wages, without murmuring or mutiny, and not de - sert the Master till the work Is finished. A yonng brother shall be instructed in working, to prevent spoiling the materials for want of judg - meat, and for increasing and continulng of hroth - erly love. All the tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge. No laborer shall be employed In the proper work of Masonry; nor shall Freemasons work with those that are not free, without an urgent necessity nor shall they teach laborers and unaccepted Masons, as they should teach a brother or fellow. VI. Of Behavior, viz.: 1. In the Lodge while constituted.—You are not to hold private committees, or separate conversa - tion, without leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinent or unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any brother speaking to the Master: Nor behave yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is engaged in what is serious and solemn; nor use any unbecoming lan - guage upon any pretence whatsoever; but to pay due reverence to your Master, Wardens, and Fel - lows, and put them to worship. If any complaint b~ brought, the brother found guilty shall stand to the award and determination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent judges of all such controversies, (unless you carry it by appeal to the Grand Lodge,) and to whom they ought to be referred, unless a lord’s work he hindered the meanwhile, in which case a particular reference may be made; but yon must never go to law about what concerneth Masonry, without an absolute necessity apparent to the Lodge. 2. Behavior after the Lodge is over, and the Brethren not gone.—You may enjoy yourselves 32 33"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"with innocent mirth, treating one another accord - ing to ability, but avoiding all excess, or forcIng any brother to eat or drink beyond his inclination, or hindering him from going when his occasions call him, or doing or saying anything offensive or that may forbid an easy and free conversation; for that would blast our harmony, and defeat our laudable purposes. Therefore, no private piques or Quarrels must be brought within the door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about religion, or nations, or State policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholic Religion above mentioned; we are also of all nations, tongues, kindreds, and lan - guages, and are resolved against all politics, as what never yet conduced to the welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This charge has heen always strictly enjoined and observed; but especially ever since the reformation in Britaln, or the dis - sent and secession of these nations from the com - munion of Rome. 3. BehavIor when Brethren meet without Stran - gers, but not in Lodge formed.—You are to salute one another in a courteous manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other brother, freely giv - ing mutual instruction, as shall be thought expe - dient, without being overseen or overheard, and without encroaching upon each other, or derogat - ing from that respect which is due to any brother, were he not a Mason; for though all Masons are as brethren upon the same level, yet Masonry takes no honor from a man that he had before; nay, rather it adds to his honor, especially If he has deserved well of the brotherhood, who must give honor to whom it is due, and avoid Ill manners. 4. Behavior In presence of Strangers not Masons.—You shall he cautious in your words and carriage, that the most penetrating stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated; and sometimes you shall divert a discourse, and manage it prudently for the honor of the worshipful Fraternity. 5. Behavior at home and in your neighborhood. —You are to act as becomes a moral and wise man; particularly, not to let your family, friends and neighbors, know the concerns of the Lodge, &c, but wisely to consult your own honor, and that ot the ancient brotherhood, for reasons not to he mentioned here. You must also consult your health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from home, atter Lodge hours are past; and by avoiding gluttony or drnnkenness, that your tamilies be not neglected or injured, nor you dis - abled from working. 6. Behavior toward a strange Brother.—You are cautiously to examine him, in such a method as prudence shall direct you, that you may not be imposed upon by an ignorant false pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and deri - sion, and beware of giving him any hints of knowl - edge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and ii he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be relieved: You must employ him some days, or else recommend him to be employed. But you are not charged to do beyond your ability, only to prefer a poor brother, that is a good man and true, and before any other poor people in the same circumstances. Finally, all these charges you are to observe, and also those that are to be communicated to you in another way; cultivating brotherly love, the foun - 34 35"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"dation and cap-stone, the cement and glory of this ancient Fraternity, avoiding all vvrangling and Quarreling, all slander and backbiting, nor per - mitting others to slander any honest brother, but defending his character, and doing him all good offices, as far as is consistent with your honor and safely, and no further. And if any of them do you injury, you must apply to your own or his Lodge; and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge at the Quarterly communication, and from thence to the annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable conduct of our forefath - ers in every nation; never taking a legal course but when the case cannot be otherwise decided, and patiently listening to the honest and friendly advice of Master and Fellows, when they would prevent your going to law with strangers, or would excite you to put a speedy period to all law sults, that so you may mind the affairs of Masonry with more alacrity and snccess; but with respect to brothers or fellows at law, the Master and breth - ren should kindly offer their mediation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the con - tending brethren; and if that submission is im - practicable, they must however, carry on their process, or law suit, without wrath and rancor, (not in the common way,) saying or doing nothing which may hinder brotherly love, and good offices to be renewed and continued; that all may see the benign influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the beginning of the world, and will do to the end of time. Amen, so mote it be. THE “OLD REGULATiONS” IN 1721. Article I. The Grand Master, or his Deputy, hath authority and right, not only to present In any true Lodge, but also to preside wherever he 36 is, with Master of the Lodge on his left hand, and to order his Grand Wardens to attend him, who are not to act in particular Lodges as War - dens, but in his presence, and at his command; be - cause there the Grand Master may command the Wardens of that Lodge, or any other brethren he pleaseth, to attend and act as his Wardens pro tempore. Art. ii. The Master of a particular Lodge has the right and authority of congregating the mem - bers of his Lodge into a Chapter at pleasure, upon any emergency or occurrence, as well as to ap - point the time and place of their usual forming; and in case of sickness, death, or necessary ab - sence of the Master, the Senior Warden shall act as Master pro tempore, if no brother is present who has been Master of that Lodge before; for in that case, the absent Master’s authority reverts to the last hi aster then present, though he cannot act until the said Senior Warden has once congre - gated the Lodge, or in his absence the Junior Warden. Art. Ill. The Master of each particular Lodge, or one of the Wardens, or some other brother by his order, shall keep a book containing their by - laws, the names of their members, with a list of all the Lodges in town, and the usual times and places of their forming, and all their transactions that are proper to be written. Art. IV. No Lodge shall make more than five new brethren at one time, nor any man under the age of twenty-five, who must also be his own mas - ter; unless by a dispensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy. Art. V. No man can be made or admitted a member of a particular Lodge without previous 37"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"notice, one month before given to said Lodge, in order to make due inQuiry into the reputation and capacity of the candidate; unless by the dis - pensation aforesaid. Art. VI. But no man can be entered a Brother In any particular Lodge, or admitted to be a mem - ber thereof, without the unanimous consent of all the members of that Lodge then present, when the candidate is proposed, and their consent formally asked by the Master; and they are to signily their consent or dissent in their own prudent way, either virtually or In form, but with unanimity; nor is this inherent privilege subject to a dispensation; because the members of a particular Lodge are the best judges of it; and if a fractious member should be imposed on them, it might spoil their harmony, or hinder their freedom; or even break and dis - perse the Lodge, which ought to be avoided by all good and true brethren. Art. VII. Every new brother at his making is decently to clothe the Lodge, that is, all the breth - ren present, and to deposit something for the relief of the indigent and decayed brethren, as the candidate shall think fit to bestow, over and above the small allowance stated bS~ the by-laws of that particular Lodge; which charity shall be lodged with the Master or Wardens, or the cashier, if the members think fit to choose one. And the candi - date shall also solemnly promise to submit to the Constitutions, the Charges and Regulations, and to such other good usages as shall be intimated to them in time and place convenient. Art. VIII. No set or number of brethren shall withdraw or separate themselves from the Lodge in which they were made brethren, or were after - wards admitted members, unless the Lodge be- comes too numerous, nor even then, without a dis - pensation from the Grand Master or his Deputy: And when they are thus separated, they must either immediately join themselves to such other Lodge as they shall like best, with the unanimous consent of that other Lodge to which they go (as above regulated), or else they must obtain the Grand Master’s warrant, to join in forming a new Lodge. If any set or number of Masons shall take upon themselves to form a new Lodge without the Grand Master’s warrant, the regular Lodges are not to countenance them, nor own them as fair brethren and duly formed, nor approve of their acts and deeds; but must treat them as rebels, until they humble themselves, as the Grand Mas - ter shall, in his prudence direct, and until he approve of them by his warrant, which must be signified to the other Lodges, as the custom is when a new Lodge is to be registered in the list of Lodges. Art. IX. But if any brother so tar misbehaves himself as to render his Lodge uneasy, he shall be twice duly admonished by the Master or Wardens in a formed Lodge; and If he will not retrain his imprudence, and obediently submit to the advice of the brethren, and reform what gives them offence, he shall be dealt with according to the by-laws of that particular Lodge, or else In such a manner as the Quarterly Communication shall in their great prudence think fit, for which a new regulation may be afterwards made. Art. X. The majority of every particular Lodge, when congregated, shall have the privilege of giv - Ing instructions to their Master and Wardens, be - fore the assembling of the Grand Chapter, or Lodge, at the three Quarterly Communications hereafter mentioned, and of the Annual Grand 38 39"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Lodge too; because their Master and Wardens are their representatives, and are supposed to speak their mind. Art. XI. All particular Lodges are to observe the same usages as much as possible; in order to which, and for the cultivating a good under - standing among Freemasons, some members out of every Lodge shall be deputed to visit the other Lodges as often as shall be thought convenient. Art. XII. The Grand Lodge consists of, and is formed by the Masters and Wardens of all the regular particular Lodges upon record, with the Grand Master at their head, and his Deputy on the left hand, and the Grand Wardens in their proper places; and must have a Quarterly Communica, - tion about Michaelmas, ChrIstmas, and Lady-Day, in some convenient place, as the Grand Master shall appoint, where no brother shall be present who is not at that time a member thereof, without a dispensation; and while he stays, he shall not be allowed to vote, nor even give his opinion, without leave of the Grand Lodge, asked and given, or unless it be duly asked by the said Lodge. All matters are to be determined in the Grand Lodge by a ma~orlty of votes, each member having one vote, and the Grand Master having two votes, unless the said Lodge leave any particular thing to the determination of the Grand Master, for the sake of expedition. Art. XIII. At the said Quarterly Communica - tion, all matters that concern the Fraternity In general, or particular Lodges, or single brethren, are Quietly, sedately, and maturely to be dis - coursed of and transacted: Apprentices must be admitted Masters and Fellow Crafts only here, unless by a dispensation - Here also all differences. 40 K_ _ that cannot be made up and accommodated pri - vat ely. nor by a particular Lodge, are to be seriously considered and decided. And if any brother thinks himself nggrieved by the decision of this board, he may appeal to the Annual Grand Lodge next ensuing, and leave his appeal in writ - ing, with the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or the Grand Wardens. Here also, the Masters or Wardens of cach par - ticular Lodge shall bring and produce a list of such members as have been made, or even ad - mitted in their particular Lodges, since the last communication of the Grand Lodge. And there shall be a book kept by the Grand Master, or his Deputy, or rather by some brother whom the Grand Lodge shall appoint for Secretary, wherein shall he recorded all the Lodges, with their usual times and pisces of brining, and names of all the members of each Lodge; and all the affairs of the Grand Lodge that are proper to be written. They shall also consider of the most prudent and effectual methods of collecting and disposing of what money shall be given to, or lodged with them in charity, towards the relief only of any true brother, fallen into poverty or decay, but of none else. But every particular Lodge shall dis - pose of their own charity for poor brethren, ac - cording to their own by-laws, until it be agreed by all the Lodges (in a new reguiatwn) to carry in the charity collected by them to Grand Lodge at the Quarterly or Annual Communication, in order to make a common stock in it, for the more handsome relief of poor brethren. They shall also appoint a Treasurer, a brother of good wordly substance, who shall be a member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his office, and shall he always present, and have power to move 41"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"to the Grand Lodge anything, especially what concerns his office. To him shall be committed all money raised for charity, or for any other use of the Grand Lodge, which he shall write down in a book, with the respective ends and uses for which the several sums are intended; and shall expend or disburse the same by such a certain order signed, as the Grand Lodge shall agree to in a new regulatioiv But he shall not vote in choosing a Grand Master or Wardens, though in every other transaction. As in like manner the Secretary shall be a member of the Grand Lodge by virtue of his office, and vote in every thing except in choosing a Grand Master or Wardens. The Treasurer and Secretary shall each have a clerk, who must be a brother and Fellow Craft, but never must be a member of the Grand Lodge, nor speak, without being allowed or desired. The Grand Master, or his Deputy, shall always command the Treasurer and Secretary with their clerks and books, in order to see how matters go on, and to know what is expedient to be done upon any emergent occasion. Another brother (who must be a Fellow Craft) should be appointed to look after the door of the Grand Lodge; but shall be no member of it. But these officers may be farther explained by a new egulation, when the necessity and expediency ot them may more appear than at present to the Fraternity. Art. XIV. If at any Grand Lodge, stated or oc - casional, Quarterly or annual, the Grand Master and bis Deputy should be both absent, then the present Master of a Lodge, that has been the r longest a Freemason, shall tabe the chair, and preside as Grand Master pro tempore; and shall be vested with all his power and honor for the time: Provided there is no brother present that has been Grand Master formerly, or Deputy Grand Master; for the last Grand Master present, or else the last Deputy present, should always of right, take place in the absence of the present Grand Master or his Deputy. Art. XV. In the Grand Lodge none can act as Wardens but the Grand Wardens themselves, if present; and if absent, the Grand Master, or the person who presides in his place, shall order pri - vate Wardens to act as Grand Wardens pro tern- pore, whose places are to be supplied by two Fel - low Crafts of the same Lodge, called forth to act, or sent thither by the particular Master thereof; or if by him omitted, then they shall be called by the Grand Master, that so the Grand Lodge may be always complete. Art. XVI. The Grand Wardens or any others, are first to advise with the Deputy about the affairs of the Lodge or of the brethren, and not to apply to the Grand Master without the knowl - edge of the Deputy, unless he refuses his concur - rence in any certain necessary affair; in which case, or in case of any difference between the Deputy and the Grand Wardens, or other brethren, both parties are to go by concert to the Grand Master, who can easily decide the controversy, and make up the difference by virtue of his great authority. The Grand Master should receive no intimation of business concerning Masonry, but from his Deputy first, except in such certain cases as his Worship can well judge of; for if the application 42 43"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"to the Grand Master be irregular, he can easily order the Grand Wardens or any other brethren thus applying, to wait upon hIs Deputy, who is to prepare the business speedily, and to lay it orderly before his Worship. Art. XVII. No Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wardens, Treasurer, Secretary, or whoever acts for them, or in their stead, pro tern- pore, can at the same time be the Master or Warden of a particular Lodge; but as soon as any of them has honorably discharged his Grand Office, he returns to that post or station in his particular Lodge, from which he was called to officiate above. Art. XVIII. If the Deputy Grand lVlaster be sick, or necessarily absent, the Grand Master may choose any Fellow Craft he pleases, to be his Deputy pro tempore: but he that is chosen Deputy of the Grand Lodge, and the Grand Wardens too, cannot be discharged without the cause fairly appear to the majority of the Grand Lodge; and the Grand Master, if he is uneasy, may call a Grand Lodge on purpose to lay the cause before - them, and to have their advice and concurrence: In which case, the majol ity of the Grand Lodge, if they cannot reconcile the Master and his Deputy or his Wardens, are to concur in allowing the Mas - ter to discharge his said Deputy or his said Wardens, and to choose another Deputy imme - diately; and the said Grand Lodge shall choose other Wardens in that case, that harmony and peace may be preserved. Art. XIX. If the Grand Master should abuse his power, and render himself unworthy of the obe - dience and subjection of the Lodge, he shall be treated in a way and manner to be agreed upon in 44 r a new regulation; because hitherto the ancient Fraternity have had no occasion for it, their former Grand D,i asters having all behaved them - selves worthy of that honorable office. Art. XX. The Grand Master with his Deputy and Wardens, shall (at least once) go round and visit all the Lodges about town during his Master - ship. Art. XXI. If the Grand Master die during his Mastership; or by sickness, or by being beyond sea, or any other way should be rendered incap - able of discharging his office, the Deputy, or In his absence, the Senior Grand Warden, or In his absence, the Junior, or in his absence, any three present Masters of Lodges, shall join to congre - gate the Grand Lodge immediately, to advise together upon that emergency, and send two of their number to invite the last Grand Master to resume his office, which now in course reverts to him; or if he refuses, then the next last, and so backward: But if no former Grand Master can be found, then the Deputy shall act as principal, untll another is chosen; or if there be no Deputy, then the oldest Master. Art. XXII. The brethren of all the Lodges in and about London and Westminster, shall meet at an Annual Communication and Feast, in some convenient place on St. John Baptist’s day, or else on St. John Evangelist’s day, as the Grand Lodge shall think fit by a new regulation, having of late years met In St. John Baptist’s day: ProvIded, the majority of the Masters and Wardens, with the Grand Master, his Deputy and Wardens agree at their Quarterly Communication, three months be - fore, that there shall be a feast, and a General Communication of all the brethren: For, If either 45"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the Grand Master, or a majority of the particular Masters, are against It, it must be dropped for that time. But whether there shall be a feast for all the brethren, or not, yet the Grand Lodge must meet In some convenient place annually on St. John’s day; or if it be Sunday, then on the next day, in order to choose every year a new Grand Master, Deputy and Wardens. Art. XXIII. If it be thought expedient, and the Grand Master, with the majority of the Masters and Wardens, agree to hold a Grand Feast, ac - cording to the ancient laudable custom of Masons then the Grand Wardens shall have the care of preparing the tickets, sealed with the Grand Mas - ter’s seal, or disposing of the ticbets, of receiving the money for the ticbets, of buying the materials 6f the feast, of finding out a proper and convenient place to feast in, and of every other thing that con - cerns the entei-tainment. But that the work may not be too burthensome to the two Grand War - dens, and that all mattel-s may be expeditiously and safely managed, the Grand Master or his Deputy, shall have power to nominate and appoint a cer - tain number ot Stewards, as his Worship shall think fit, to act in concert with the two Grand Wardens; all things relating to the feast being decided amongst them by a majority of voices; except the Grand Master or his Deputy interpose by a particular direction or appointment. Art. XXIV. The Wardens and Stewards shall In due time, wait upon the Grand Master, or his Deputy, for directions and orders about the prem - ises; but if his Worship and his Deputy are sick, or necessarily absent, they shall call together the Masters and Wardens of Lodges to meet on pur - pose for their advice and orders; or else they may take the matter wholly upon themselves, and do 46 the best they can. The Grand Wardens and the Stewards are to account for all the money they receive, or expend, to the Grand Lodge after din - ner, or when the Grand Lodge shall see fit to receive their accounts. If the Grand Master pleases, he may in due time summon all the Masters and Wardens or Lodges to consult with them about ordering the Grand Feast, and about any emergency or accidental thing relating there- unto, that may require advice; or else to take it upon himself altogether. Art. XXV. The Masters of Lodges shall each appoint one experienced and discreet Fellow Craft of his Lodge, to compose a committee consisting of one from every Lodge, who shall meet to receive, in a convenient apartment, every person that brings a ticket, and shall have power to dis - course him, if they think fit, in order to admit him, or debar him, as they shall see cause. Pro - vIded, they send no man away before they have acquainted all the brethren within the doors with the reason thereof, to avoid mistakes; that so no true brother may be debarred, nor a false brother, or mere pretender admitted. This committee mnst meet very early on St. John’s day at the place. even before any persons come with tickets. Art. XXVI. The Grand Master shall appoint two or more trusty brethren to be porters, or doorkeepers, who are also to be early at the place, for some good reasons; and who are to be at the command of the committee. Art. XXVII. The Grand Wardens, or the Stew - ards shall appoint beforehand such a number of brethren to serve at tables as they think fit and proper for that work; and they may advise with the Masters and Wardens of Lodges about the 47 7 ~ -= ,A ~"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"most proper persons, if they please, or may take in such by their recommendation; for none are to serve that day, but Free and Accepted Masons, that the Communication may be free and har - monious. Art. XXVIII. All the members of the Grand Lodge must be at the place long before dinner, with the Grand Master, or his Deputy, at their head, ‘who shall retire, and form themselves. And this is done in order— 1. To receive any appeals duly lodged, as above regulated, that the appellant may be heard, and the affairs may be amicably decided before dinner, If possible; but if it cannot, it must be delayed till after the new Grand Master is elected; and if it cannot be decided after dinner, It may be delayed, and referred to a particular committee, that shall quietly adjust it, and make report to the next Quarterly Communication, that brotherly love may be preserved. 2. To prevent any difference or disgust which may be feared to arise that day; that no interrup - tion may be given to the harmony and pleasure of the Grand Feast. 3. To consult about whatever concerns the de - cency and decorum of the Grand Assembly, and to prevent all Indecency and ill manners, the as - sembly being promiscuous. 4. To receive and consider of any good motion, or any momentous and Important affair, that shall be brought from the particular Lodges, by their Representatives, the several Masters and Wardens. Art. XXIX, After these things are discussed, the Grand Master and his Deputy, the Grand 48 r Wardens, or the Stewards, the 8ecrotar~, the Treasurer, the Clerks, and every other person shall withdraw, and leave the Masters and War - dens of the particulai- Lodge alone, in order to consult amicably about electing a new Grand N aster, or continuing the present, If they have not done it the day before; and if they are unanimous for continuing the present Grand Master, his Worship shall be called in, and humbly desired to do the Fraternity the honor of ruling them for the year ensuing: and after dinner it will be known whether he accepts of It or not: for it should not be discovered but by the election itself. Art. XXX. Then the Masters and Wardens, and all the brethren, may converse promiscuously, or as they please to sort together, until the dinner is coming in, when every brother takes his seat at table. Art. XXXI, Some time after dinner the Grand Lodge is formed, not in retirement, but in the presence of all the brethren, who yet are not mem - hers of it, and must not therefore speak until they are desired and allowed. Art. XXXII. If the Grand Master of last year has consented with the Masters and Wardens in private, before dinner, to continue for the year en - suing, then one of the Grand Lodge, deputed for that purpose, shall represent to all the brethren his Worship’s good government, &c. And turning to him, shall, in the name of the Grand Lodge, humbly request him to do the Fraternity the great honor (if nobly born, if not) the great kindness of continulng to be their Grand Master for the year ensuing. And his Worship declaring his consent by a bow or speech, as he pleases, the said deputed member of the Grand Lodge shall pro- 49 I —"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"r claim him Grand Master, and all the members of the Lodge shall salute him in due form. And all the brethren shall tor a few minutes have leave to declare their satisfaction, pleasure, and congratulatiOn. Art. XXXIII. But if either the Master and Wardens have not in private, this day before din - ner, nor, the day before, desired the last Grand Master to continue in the Mastership another year; or if he, when desired, has not consented: then, the last Grand Master shall nominate hIs successor for the year ensulag, who, it unani - monsly approved by the Grand Lodge, and if there present, shall be proclaimed, saluted, and con - gratulated the new Grand Master as above hinted, and immediately installed by the last Grand Mas - ter, according to usage. Art. XXXIV. But, If that nomination Is not unanimously approved, the new Grand Master shall be chosen Immediately by ballot, every Master and Warden writing his man’s name too; and the man, whose name the last Grand Master shall first take out, casually or by chance. shall be Grand Master for the year ensuing~ and if present, he shall be proclaimed, saluted, and congratulated, as above hinted, and forthwith in - stalled by the last Grand Nlaster, according to usage. Art. XXXV. The last Grand Master thus con - tinued, or the new Grand Master thus installed, shall next nominate and appoint his Deputy Grand Master, either the last or a new one, who shall be also declared, saluted, and congratulated, as above hinted. The Grand Master shall also nominate the new Grand Wardens, and if unanimously approved by the Grand Lodge, shall be declared, saluted, and congratulated, as above hinted; but if not, they shall be chosen by ballot, in the sane maimer as the Grand Master: As the Wa~dotw or private Lodges are also to be choson by ballot In each Lodge, if the members hei-oof do nOt agree to their Master’s nomination. Art. XXXVI. But if the brother whom the pres - eat Grand Master shall nominate for his successor, or whom the majority of the Grand Lodge shall happen to choose by ballot, is, by sickness or other necessary occasion, absent from the Grand E~east, he cannot be proclaimed the new Grand Master, unless the old Grand Master, or some of the Mas - ters and Wardens of the Grand Lodge can vouch, upon the honor of a brother, that the said person, so nominated or chosen, will readily accept of the said office; in which case the old Grand Master shall act as proxy, and shall nominate the Deputy and Wardens in his name, and in his name also receive the usual honors, homage, and congratu. lations. Art. XXXVII. Then the Grand Master shall allow any brother, Fellow Craft, or Apprentice, to speak, directing his discourse to his Worship; or to make any motion tor the good of the Fraternity, which shall be either immediately considered and finished, or else reterred to the consideration of the Grand Lodge at their next communication, stated or occasional. When that is over. Art. XXXVIII. The Grand Master or his Dep~ uty, or some brother appointed by him, shall harangue all the brethren, and give them good advice: And lastly, after some other transactlou~i, that cannot be written in any language, the bretli’ ren may go away or stay longer, as they please. 50 51."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"F- Art.
