Although many erudite brethren have delved into the history and myst&ies of Free - masonry no one has as. yet determined the exact time the fraternity o’riginated or where it first came into being. Many believe the Sublime Degree of Mas - ter Mason to be the ultimate degree of Free - mason~ry and that all others are added and explanatory. Most students of Freemasonry agree that the story of the Craft as presented in the three degrees is incomplete and that the degrees offered in the York Rite of Free - masonry complete the story and answer many of the questions in the mind of the newly made Master Mason. In Royal Arch Masonry is found the es - sentials of symbolism and philosophy neces - sary for a Master Mason to understand that which he has received only in part. On the union of the Grand Lodges in 1813, a part of the compact of union read, “Ancient Craft Masonry consists of three degrees and no more namely, those of the Entered Appren - tice, ~‘elloweraft and Master Mason including the Holy Royal Arch.” The York Rite consists of the degrees of the Royal Arch Chapter, the Council of Royal and Select Masters and the orders of the Commandery of Knights Templar.

The degree of Mark Master teaches us to discharge our several duties punctually and with precision, the duty of assisting a dis - tressed brother is forcibly illustrated. Histor - ically the degree illustrates the process by which the work on the temple accomplished by each craftsman was identified. The Past Master degree came into being because originally the degree of Royal Arch was conferred by the Symbolic Lodge only on actual Past Masters. This restriction pre - vented many worthy brethren from receiving the full information of the degrees of Free - masonry. The degree of Past Master was in - stituted in order to conform to tradition and to make it possible for worthy brethren to receive the Royal Arch degree. The conferring of this degree by a Chapter gives a brother no rights as a Past Master in a Symbolic Lodge unless he has actually served as Master of his Lodge. The Most Excellent Master degree dram - atizes the historical incidents of the comple - tion and dedication of King Solomon’s Temple. This degree emphasizes the opportunity and obligation of Companions to disseminate light and knowledge to less informed brethren. The Royal Arch Degree is set in a later period in the history of the 3ewish people. Events of the rebuilding of the second tem - ple are the basis of the degree. We learn how many of the sacred objects of the Jewish people were irreserved, discovered and restor - ed.
