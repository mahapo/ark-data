It has been our finding that, outside of the vaults of the Supreme Councils for the Southern and Northern Jurisdictions of the United States, and several Grand Lodge libraries, this document is not to be found. Of the “Secret Work,” no complete copies appear to exist outside of the Supreme Councils. As Brother Pike noted (p 14, Book of the Lodge) “This Ritual is intended for instruction only, in the States of the Southern Jurisdiction, where there are no Lodges working the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite; to be studied and understood before investiture with the fourth degree. For, without it, the system of that Rite is incomplete, and even like a fabric without foundation.” It may be correctly assumed that Pike had intended this Ritual of the first three degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, as a supplement to the “American Rite” Degrees 1 through 3, and not a replacement for it. This to provide that “post—graduate” instruction so necessary to allow an effective transition from the one Rite to the other. Due to a prevailing provincial mentality that exists among the hierarchy of Freemasonry today, the fear that Pike’s Ritual would supplant the existing American Rite Degrees, has effectively buried this important document in the hope that its implied “threat” would somehow disappear. But such is not to be the case. It is with great pleasure that we, who are student’s of Albert Pike’s philosophy, and of the Ancient Mysteries in general, publish Albert Pike’s The Book of the Lodge . The Secret Work, as provided here, to these three degrees has been faithfully reconstructed from fragments of the original document, plus esoteria from French, Spanish, and Latin American manuscripts that existed from 1830 through 1880. In determining the nature of the esoteria and how best to apply it, we adopted methodologies used by Albert Pike in his Degrees 4—32. It is our contention that this Secret Work is true to the intent of Pike’s Ritual, and that any variances (unless otherwise noted) are purely unintentionaL —3—"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SECRET WORK THE BOOK OF THE LODGE -4-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SECRET WORK THE BOOK OF THE LODGE DEGREE 1 APPRENTICE 0.1.

Like the early Christian mysteries, it was a discipline.” For, during whole centuries, a word, the least indiscretion, a gesture, was a death warrant. The miter and crown were then in league together against man. The Inquisition classed Masons with Jews and heretics, and dealt with them by the tender mercies of torture. To be a Mason then, was to expose one’s self to the same dangers as surrounded the Christian under Nero and Domitian. The existence of the entire Masonic body was involved in every initiation. Masonry comes more directly from the mysteries of the sun, and those of Mithra, in Persia. There the aspirant commenced by easy tests, and arrived by degrees at those that were most cruel, in which his life was often endangered. No one can be initiated, says Suidas, until after he has proven, by the most terrible trials, that he possesses a manly soul, exempt from the sway of every passlon. Masonry has softened, but has not chosen to dispense with, the ancient tests; for it is not in free countries only that she exists; nor is it in them that she plays the most important part. Neither, even in these, is there any guarantee of the eternity of freedom, or that the powers of government may not be usurped by those to which masonry might become dangerous, and would be hostile, unless false to its mission. 0.17.

If the candidate declined it, he was dismissed with contempt. If he made it and succeeded, he was termed “thrice—born,” was eligible to all the dignities of the state, and received complete instruction in the philosophical and religious doctrines of the Druids. When the aspirant was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis, he was conducted to the nearest baths, and after having bathed, the priest first solicited forgiveness of him of the gods, and then sprinkled him all over with the clearest and purest water, and conducted him back to the temple. It was required of every initiate that his heart and hands be free of every stain. It was represented that, except for the gravest sins, there was opportunity for expiation; and the tests of air, water, and fire were represented, by means of which, during the march of many years, the soul could be purified, and rise toward the ethereal regions. The ascent being more or less tedious and laborious, according as each soul was more or less clogged by the gross impediments of its sins and vices.

The following lesson is read during the three circuits LITURGY C. (p 269, Liturgy p 164] VM: God, in the Hebrew writings, is continually symbolized by LIGHT. The sun was regarded as His visible image. The “Word of God” is explained by Philo in Eusebius, to be the universal and invisible light, SOURCE substance or essence of the light recognizable by the senses, and which shines forth from the planets and stars. The word LIGHT was used to express this essence, of which visible light is the manifestation. The Deity was better expressed, as the mysterious essential FIRE, of which FLAME is the action, LIGHT is the outfiowing or manifestation. The worship of fire and light was the basis of all the religions of antiquity. Agni, the fire, and Indra, the light, were the highest deities of our ancestors the Aryans. And when Zarathustra, among the Bactro— or Irano—Aryans, imagined a spiritual God, Ahura Mazda, superior to these, and author and creator of the universe, with his seven emanations, the Amesha—Qpentas, the second of these was Asha—Vahista, the spirit of fire; and fire is continually called in the Zend—Avesta, the son of Ahura—Mazda. The Persian Mithra was the sun, but the original Bactrian and Iranian Mithra was the morning star. In the Vedic hymns, composed at least 4,000 and probably 5,000 years before the birth of Christ, the sun, moon, planets and stars are bodies by which Agni and Indra, fire and light, manifest themselves. They are, all, Agni and Indra, in act, limited and defined by form and body. The Avesta calls the sun the body of Ahura - Mazda. The Indo-Aryans had the same idea. By the Helleno - Aryans, the sun was regarded as the visible image of the Deity. The Seven Amesha-Vpentas, or DIVINE EMANATIONS, known to the Hebrews by their median captivity, became the seven Archangels, of which one was assigned to each of the seven bodies, formerly called “the planets”. They were still emanations or rays from the invisible essential light, which was the very Deity,—-rays by —51—"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"SECRET WORK THE BOOK OF ThE LODGE which the Deity was manifested and shone forth, each being the Deity manifested in one mode and characteristic. Accordingly, each Archangelic name has a reference to this light, which is the Deity. Tsaphiel, means the Splendor of Al. Raphael, the Healing of Al, reminding us of “the sun of righteousness rising with healing in his wings.” Hamaliel, the Benignity of Al. Zarakiel, the Rising ot Al. Auriel, the Light of Al. Gabriel, the Potency of Al. And Michael, the Image of Al. On all the monuments of Mithra, we see by the side of that god seven altars or pyres, consecrated to the seven planets. And these and the seven candlesticks represented the seven spheres or vessels that shed abroad in the universe the ethereal light. By these altars the seven angels are seen. Sometimes, instead of the altars are seen seven stars, symbolized by the seven gates of the Mithriac cave, through which the initiates passed; and which passages are presented by your journeys. The ancients thought that the natural home of the soul of man was in the highest regions of the universe, in the sphere of the fixed stars. Hence it was held to have descended through the seven planetary spheres, to illumine the body, to communicate to it form and movement, to vivify and animate it; in the same manner as, when the universe of matter was a shapeless chaos, the breath of God moved on the surface of the abyss. The soul tends to reascend, as soon as it can free itself from the impediment of matter. The reascension of each soul would be more or less tedious and laborious, according as it was more or less clogged by the gross impediments of its sins and vices. Except for the gravest sins there could be expiation; and by penance, repentance, acts of beneficence and prayer, symbolized by the tests of water, air and fire, the soul could be purified, and rise toward the ethereal region. But grave crimes were mortal sins, beyond the reach of such remedies. The visible world is the image of the invisible world. The essence of the human soul is the image of God; and its home is above the stars. The equinoxes were the gates through which souls passed to and fro, between the hemisphere of light.., and that of darkness. Near each of —52—"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"SECRET WORK THE BOOK OF ThE LODGE these gates passed the galaxy; and it was termed “the Pathway of the Souls.” The symbolic image of this passage among the stars, was a ladder reaching from earth to heaven, divided into seven steps or stages, to each of which was a gate, and at the summit an eighth, that of the fixed stars. You have already seen this Mystic Ladder in a former degree, though there it was represented as having three steps. It is by knowledge as well as morals the soul ascends toward the stars, and climbs the skies to its home. An emanation of the ethereal fire, exiled from the luminous starry region, it descended through the planetary gates, and by the equinoctial and solstitial doors, along the Milky Way, to be immured in the prison-house of matter. There the body is its prison, until it shall at last return to its place of origin, its home, through the constellations and planetary spheres. Through the gate of Capricorn, along the galaxy, and by the way of the seven spheres it must ascend. To reascend to the unity of its source, it must pass through a series of trials and migrations. The scene of these is the grand sanctuary of initiations, the world. Their primary agents are the elements; the means, are the sorrows, the trials and the calamities of life. Thus the theories of the ancients were not mere barren speculations; but a study of the means for arriving at the great object proposed, the perfecting of the soul, and, as a consequence, that of morals and society and the state. The earth, to them, was not the soul’s home, but its place of exile. Its home and birth—place was Heaven. To purify this soul of its passions, and weaken the empire of the body over it, to give him true happiness here below, and expedite his reascension to his home, was the object of initiation. *13.

My brother, there are three signs of a Master Mason: The Sign of Order is made by standing and bringing towards the heart the open right hand, palm upward, the fingers of which are separate and the thumb erect as much as possible, holding the hand horizontally, the right arm close to the body. The Sign of Recognition is made after you have been placed in order, by drawing the hand horizontally, as if to cut the breast with the thumb raised. Raise the hands to the height of the head, the ends of the fingers touching, and say, “Oh Lord, my God!” Let the hands now fall on the apron, in an attitude of surprise and astonishment. This is also called the Sign of Horror and alludes to the shock of finding the body of the Master Hiram.

Then say, “Come to my assistance, you children of the widow!” To this cry or to this gesture, all Masters who observe this Sign are obliged to hasten to the aid of the brother so giving it. The Sign of Distress, in certain situations, may be made simply and quickly by the reversing of the hands on the head, and without uttering the cry for help.

Finally, raise the right leg, and repeat the maneuver, moving forward and to the right, bring the left leg up, heel to heel, forming the angle of a square. The True Grip of a Master is made on the Five Points of Fellowship. It is made by each brother approaching and placing their right feet, touching, side by side. Each brother then positions right knee to right knee, left hand on the other’s right shoulder, breast to breast. Taking each other’s right hand they make the Strong Grip of the Master, by gripping so that the four fingers grip the wrist of the other. In this position, they whisper in the ear of the other the Sacred Word. The True Grip of a Master signifies that even if a brother has, by sin and shame, sunken, in his own estimation and that of the world, into the depths from which there seems to be no redemption, still you will endeavor to raise him from this death to a new life of manliness, honor, and virtue, not contenting yourself with one trial, nor with two, but using in the third every means and inducement in your power. The Sacred Word, or “the Substitute Word”, is not ever to be pronounced, much less written. In order to communicate it between Master Masons, they must whisper it by syllable, the one to the other, orally, as follows: (TO THE SENIOR DEACON) Give me the Sacred Word.

With the lat - ter, a devnrtUre from the stated forms of expression Is allowable. Of the portions which permit of no alteration are to be reck. oned the forms of opening and closing the Lodge, and those uarts of the ceremonial of preparation and initiation which apply Immediately to the matter itself. The lessons of instruction may in part be omitted, and afterward given the Initiate to read; the prayers may be varied and departed from, when It appears proper. Still, it would not seem desirable, even as to these por - tions, to be too solicitous for new forms or expressions, as tha Ritual itself olers sufficient Variety.

MASOI{RY. ~E7flflTION5 AND OBJECTS 07, ETC. Maso~ntr, more appropriately called F3EE•MASO~rRT,—I.A French, Franc Ma ponnerie,—has received many definitions. The definition given of tbe Order by the Grand Orient of France is: “The Order of Frank Masons is an associatIon of wise and virtuous men, whose object is to live in perfect equality, to be intimately connected by the ties of esteem, eon - fidence, and friendship, under the name of Brethren; and to stimulate each other to the practice of the Virtues.” An English definition is, that “Free.Masonry is a system of Morality, veiled in Allegory and illustrated by Symbols.” Each definition is exceedingly imperfect. The Order of Free - Masons is, or ought to be, au association of intelligent, virtu - ous, disinterested, generous, and devoted men, regarding each other as Free, Equals, and Brothers, and bound by the obliga - tious of Fraternity to render each other mutual assistance. And Free-Masonry is a system and school, not only of morals, but of political and religious philosopl~y, suggested by its Alle - gories and concealed under its Symbols. And, including in itself several degrees of Knighthood, it is also a Chivalric Order, requiring the practice and pertormance of the highest. duties of the Man, the Citizen, the Patriot, and the Soldier. The true definitiou of the Free-Masonry of the Ancicnt and Acccpted Scottish Rite is this: It is an advance to~vard the Light; a constant endeavor, in all its Degrees, to elevate the Divine that is in Man, the Spiritual portion of his compound nature, his Reason and his Moral Sense, above, and make It dominant over, and master of, the human, earthly, and material portion of his nature, his passions, and his sensual appetites."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"14 TEE LODGE.

The Order into which you now ask to enter acknow- ledges its responsibilities, its duties to the country, its duties to humanity, the necessity for progress. Thus it has the right of demanding the perrorrnance of grave duties, and stern sacrifices, of its Initiates. It has foreshadowed to thee what these duties may be; what the extent of these sacrifices.

The preparation by Abraham to sacrifice his only legitimate son, is a grand and sublime allegory. So a country or a society must place its children on the altar when the coming generation demands it. We have spoken to you of an obligation. The Order will demand one of you—solemn, exacting, terrible. It has been tn.ken by many of the best and greatest men that ever lived.

The Kabalah of the Hebrews, and our Brethren the Alchemists and Hermetic philosophers, also recognized these as the four elements; and aspirants to Initiation have in all ages been tested by each. You were immersed 1 alone, in the darkness and silence of a subterranean vault or dungeon, as a prisoner, and surrounded by emblems of mortality and the written utterances of wisdom: firstly, to compel serious and solemn reflection, the proper pre - paration of a step so momentous as initiation into the Mysteries.

And we hoped that you, remembering this, would be inspired with a pious anger against all Despotism, over the body or the conscience: and witha more fervent Jove for such free institutions of Government as forbid the imprisonment of a Galileo for announc - ing a physical fact, and that of a Harnpden or a Sydney for proclaiming political truths so rudimental that they are now taught as axioms to children. The first act of an oppressed people, asserting its rigbt, under God’s patent, to freedom, is to destroy the Basti 1 les which were the pride and sarety of their imperious Masters. We hoped that you would reflect that it could not but be the duty of a Society of intelligent men not only to do its utmost to release th~ prisoners unjustly confined in dungeons of stone and iron ; but also to demolish the Bastilles, stronger than those material ones, in which Ignorance and Error, Superstitions and Prejudices, keep manacled"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"-1~~~~ TNE DiTEEROGATZOM. 83 the spirits, the intellects, and the consciences of so vast a majority of the great human family.

The cell of the Martyr of Liberty is irradiated with a holy light; the dungeon of the Victim of Spiritual Des - potism retains the traces of the consoling presence of the Holy Spirit of God. The emblems of mortality around you could not but teach you to reflect on the instability and brevity of human life. But that, by itself alone, is a trite lesson, daily taught nnd ever disregarded. You should also have reflected of how little value is that which is so short and held by so uncertain a tenure, wheu weighed in the scales against Duty and Honor; amid how infinitely mean is an ignoble, useless, idle life, in comparison with a glorious death, or with benefits conferred on one’s country or one’s fellows, at the risk of life."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"84 7HZ WTEflROGATI ON.

To be virtu - ous is to be happy; and if it were not, happiness is not the chief end of man ‘S existence. To be happy and contented is a privilege bestowed on the animals.

This flrst jourucy, with its roam lags, its thun - ders, its clectric shocks, reprcseuts the second cle - ment, the Am, which, with its meteors, miasms, liglitnings, and continual fluctuations, incessantly meunces us with death. It was ancicntly considcred one of the means by which the souls of the dead were purified. “As physical bodies,” the old sages said, are exalted from earth to water, rroiu water to air, from air to fire, so the man may rise into the Hero, the Hero into the God.” In the course of nature the soul, to recover its lost estate, must pass through a series of trials and migrations. The scene of those trials is the Grand Sanctuary of Initiation, the uni - verse : their primary agents are the elements, and Dionusos is official arbiter of the Mysteries, guide of the Soul, the Sun, the Liberator of the elements, Creator or the world, Guardian, Liberator and Sa - Tiour of the Soul, ushcred into the world amidst hightuings and thundcr. Again, the Air is a symbol or Vitality or life.

The Air, to the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"TEE JOUDHEYS. 99 Hebrews, Btmbolized .YeyAesc&, or Vitality, the lowest portion or the immaterial part of man, of the Trinity of LIFE, SnRzr, and MIND. The Air, therefore, is a natural and apt emblem of human life, with its cross - currents, its agitations, its stagnations, its lassitudes and energies, its storms and calnis, its electrical dis - turbances and equilibria. So also the comparison of the life of man to a journey, has always been familiar to moralists and philosophers: and thus the journey you have taken is a fit emblem of that life, with its tumult of the passions, its shoeks of conflicting inter - ests, its difficult undertakings, its successes and re - verses, Its obstacles, multiplying and co-operating to hinder and embarrass. But this Is too trite an interpretation, though true, to be the only one. Your journey also represents the Progress of a People; that Progress, to assist In which Is the highest aim of Freemasonry. Progress is the Mode of Man. The general life of the Human Race is called Progress. It is the collective advance of the Human Race. Progress marches; it makes the great human and terrestrial journey toward the Celestial and the Divine, from the Square. to the Compass. It meets delays, recoils at and then over - comes its obstacles: it has its halts, where it rallies the belated flock: ii has its stations, where it medi - tates, in sight of some Canaan, suddenly unveiling its horizon. It has its nights when it sleeps: and"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"I00 TEE OUB~~Et5. it is one of the bitter anxieties of the Thitiker, to see the shadow upon the Human Soul, and in the dark - ness to feel Progress asleep, without beiug able to waken it. But he who despairs is wrong. Progress infallibly awakens ; and even in sleep it advances, for it has grown. Wlicn we see it standing ngai n, we find it taller. To be always peaceful belongs to Progress no more than to the air and the river. Each of these meets obstructions ; the air-currents flow against and around forests and mountains ; the river flows over rocks. These make the air roll and eddy in billows, the water foam, and humanity seethe. Hence storms, hurricanes, cataracts, eddies, and counter-currents, troubles, conrusions, revolutions; but after these we find that ground has been gained. The Inquisition imprisons Galileo, but the Earth still moves. Until Order, which is but Universal Peace, be established, until harmony and unity reign, Progress will have flevolutions for stations. The Nations, moreover, are blind, and the DE5TI~T that leads them onward is symbolized by your guide, the Terrible Brother.

Tbe opinioos of the mass of men are imposed upon them, not adopted upon reflection and examination. Custom and Prejudice are the blind guides or the blind. Yet the Truth dreads nothing: and he who does not ex - ercise his Reason, even in matters of faith, remains a child, a blind traveller, all his lire. To forbid one the use or his reason, and to require him to accept his faith at tbc dictates of another, is an absurdity; since, if faith be unreasoning, no man can show in what respect Ais faith deserves the preference over that or any other.

But there is not, nor ever was, any such division of his time by one Mason in ten thousand ; nor is it re - quired of a Mason. Wherefore the explanation and application are faulty and incorrect. It is neither appropriate nor philosophical.

When those who made our Association what it now is, concealed its true nature by adopting tho name and character of a particular body of artificers, in order that they might pursue their great and beime - ficent purposes in safety, they of course adopted the implements of that trade, and distributed theiu among the different classes of their members. To the En - tered Appremitices they assigned those of the appro - priate hard and rudimental labor, the hammering or cutting down to certain lines and di,ucmmsious, of the rude, rough blocks of stone. Probably these imnple - ments had originally no symbolic meaning. It is true that, in the Hieroglyphic language of Egypt, a AaicAet denoted Gon, and a cubit, JUSTICE.

Our Lodges are situated, or should be situ - ated, due East and West: because, our Catechism says, all Temples are so situated ; and these are so, because the Gospel was first preached in the East, and afterward extended into the West. The reason given in the York Rite is, that the Tabernacle of Moses was built East and West, and that Solomon, in imitation of it, so built the Temple. The Taber - nacle was a movable tent; but whenever set up it was probably placed with its mouth to the rising Sun, since the North, South, West, and East sides are spoken of in its description and the description of its Court. The Temple, like the Pyramids, was built by the cardinal points; and Ezekiel saw in his vision the Glory of the God of Israel coming from the way of the East, and entering into the House by the way of the Gate toward the East. It was an oblong square, sixty cubits long by twenty wide; the Oracle or Holy of Holies at the West end, twenty cubita sq~are; the Inner Court, forty cubits by twenty; ‘with a porch the whole ‘width of the building, and ten cubits deep, in which was a wide gate - way.

My Brother, you are now a Mason. Masons, in the highest sense of the word, are Architects, who erect not only houses for ordinary dwellii:g-places, but palaces, churches, Cathedrals and Temples. There has always been a symbolic meaning attached to the words “House,” “Building,” and “Builder.” The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite has been always called The Masonry of flerodom, of the Holy House ; that is, of the House of the Temple of Solo - mon. “According to the graee of God,” says the Apostle Paul, “which is given unto me, as a Wise Master-Builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed bow ho buildeth thereupon. . . . Every man’s work shall be made manifest. . . . H any man’s work abide, which he bath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.” . . . “If our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not wade with hands, eter - nal in the Heavens. . . .

The Sym - bolism was ready to their hand. The House and the Temple were accepted Symbols of a moral and virtu - ous character, of a free State, of a true system of Philosophy, of a spiritual worship. The Brethren are the living stones of the edifice, cemented together by the cement of Brotherhood. As an Apprentice, you are to build up this moral Temple in your own heart, and to aid in erecting the Universal Temple of Liberty upon the Earth. It is the Mason who erects fortifications; and in a free country Freemasons are to build them against the enemies of Freedom, against Error, Intolerance and Usurpation, Luxury and Corruption, Fraud and Ambition. The Ancient Poets, in their allegories, said that NEPTUNE and APOLLO offered themselves as Masons to Laomedon, to help him build the walls of Troy.

In the theory and practice of Geometry the CoMriss and RULE, or SCALE, are indispensable, and that is one reason why you have borno them in your journey. The Compass, also, is the symbol of the circle which it describes, and of the celestial spheres.

One must go fitr beyond those rules to imitate the Benefi - cent nud Glorious Deity. Loving-kinducss, Gener - osity, Devotedncss, Sympathy—these, and the like, are of the Divine. The RULE is not a symbol of Fraternity, nor even of the kindnesses one owes his neighbor. The CoM1’Ass also, by which, round a fixed point, we describe the circle, emblem of Deity or the Bupreme Wisdom, is itself an emblem of that Wis - dom.

That edifice was erected by SOLOMON on Mount 3loriah, purchased by David. “TIme King coinnianded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the House. And Solomon’s builders and Huroin’s builders did hew them, and the Stone - Squarers,” or men of Byblos—the Giblemites. The length of the House was sixty cubits, or one lIuD(lrcd and two and a half feet, and its breadth twenty cubits, or thirty-four feet.

Always we encounter the same trivial and commonplace ex - pla nations. Tue CUBE, with the Pyramid SUperl)OSitCd, is the symbol of a Free State. Tbe Cube represents the People.

It Is therefore neces - sary you should have working-tools. Those of a Fellow-Craft are the SQUARE, the LEvEL, and the PLUMB. The SQUARE, you already know, is the Jewel of the Master; the PLUMB, ol’ the Senior Warden; and the LEVEL, of the Junior Warden. They symbolize the building squarely up, with great stones laid truly and horizontally, the perpendicular walls of the fabric of individual character, and that or the State. They are also symbols of the three great Powers of the State, on the healthy and independent actioa of each of which, and the performance by each of its appropriate functions, depends the continuance of the State. The SQUARE Is a symbol of C’ontrol, and (lierefore of the Executiye Power, vested in a hereditary or e•lective Chief Magistrate. The PLUMB Is a symbol of Redilucte or Upright - nes; or luilexible Law and Regulation, and therefore of the Legislative Power. And the LEVEL is a symbol of Eguality in the sight of the law, and of Impartiality; and therefore or the Judicial Power. They are POWER, WISDOM, JUSTICE. The law is tIme same for the State as for tIme in - dividual: calamity shall follow as the consequence of wrong. “He that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions;"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"238 JX5ThUCflON. that sliaketh his hands from holding of bribes; that stoppeth his ears against bloody advice, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil ; he shall dwell on high ; his stronghold the itupreguable rocks; bread shall be supplied him, and water not fail.” In this degree you see one point of the Compass on the Altar raised above the Square. You are now half way between the things of Earth and those of Heaven; between the moral and political, and the philosophical and spiritual. In the ancient English work of this degree, the staircase consisted of eleven steps, in five Divisions, the mysLic numbers, 3, 5, ‘7, and 11, following each other. The number Five, it was said, reminded the Candidate or “the five remarkable points in the ever- blessed career of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,” and Eleven, “or the miraculous preservation of Joseph, who preceded his eleven Brethren into Egypt.” These are mere puerilities. The numbers and stairway are Eabalistic. In that system of Philosophy there ore, including fAiTH, eleven Emanations front the Deity, or SEPH1IiOTII, through which one ascends in thought to the ABSO - LUTE, ~atneless, Unmanirested Deity. 3, 5, 7, and 11, added together, make 26.

SA3~TOT~FIOATIO~T BY TEE CROSS. The Cross is a symbol of devotedness and self - sacrifice. From the time of the Crusades it has be - longed to Fellow-Craft Masons. Pointing to the four quarters of the Compass, consisting of two lines in - tersected at right angles by each other, so that, though infinitely prolonged, no two of the extremi - ties could ever meet, It was honored as a striking symbol of the Universe by mnuny. nations of antiquity, aod imitated by the Hindus and Celtic Druids in the shape of their Temples. The Crux Ansata was a Cross, with a serpent in a circle above It. The Tau Cross Is a most ancient symbol. “And the Lord said unto him,” says Ezekiel, “Go through the midst of the City, through the midst of Jerusalem, and mark the letter TAU upon the foreheads of those that high and mourn for all the abominations that be done"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"240 TilE CflOSS. in the midst titer cof.” Tue TAU was the emblem of LIFE and SAI.vATiox. it was set on those who were acquitted by the Judges, as a symbol of innocence ; mid the Military Comii~iiders placed it oim soldiers who ese~ped unhurt from the field of battle, as a sign of their being saved by the Divine Prot~cLion. STAT CRUX, miun vot~vrrun Onems—Me cross stands, trliile the world rcroh~cs—was the device given his Order by MAV~TIN, the Eleventh General of the Cam - thusions. So let. Freemasonry always staitd, true to her ancient l)riIIciples, the Champion and Tribune of the People, the advocate of the miglmts of man, what - soever revolutions there may be in the profane world I In your studies you will have constant occasion to remark how extensive has beei the corruption of words, how general the loss of the true meaning of the symbols. A Rite whiclm transmuted Pythagoras— in Frcmichi, Piagore—a native of C~rotona, into Pete,’ qowcr, an Englishman resident at Groton, in England, owes it to accident if it has preserved anything accu - rately. Take, for example, the word SIIIBDoLETII. A ilonian name of Jupiter was Lapis, a stone; or J~api - deus, stony. In making barg8ins, the swearer held in his band a flint stone, nud said: If, knowingly, I deceive, so let Diespiter, &iving the City and the capitol, cast me away from all that is good, as I cast away t1 1 is BlOne.” Whereupon he threw the stone away.

It was promised the Initiate at Samothrace, that he should become pure and just.

The Initiate, become an Epoylis, was called a SEER. “HiiL, KEW-BORK LIGUT I” the Initiates cried, in the mysteries or DioKusos. Once more we remind you, that the first learning in the world consisted chiefly of symbols; and that even Modern Philosophy uses them far more than it does definitions. The wisdom or the Hindus, Chal - deans, Persians, Egyptians, Hebrews, of Moses, Zarathustra, Pythagoras, Pherecydes, Socrates, Plato, of all the ancients, that has come down to us, is sym - bolic. It was the mode, says Samanus, on Plato’s Symposium, of the ancient Philosophers to represent Truth by symbols and occult images. “All that can be said concerning the Gods,” says SmABO, ‘ must be by the exposition of old opinions and fables; it being the custom of the ancients to wrap up in enigma and allegory their thoughts and discourses concerning nature ; which are therefore not easily explained.” Masonry still follows the ancient method of teach - ing. Her symbols are her instruction. The Lectures are but hints and helps toward the interpretation of"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"266 E~rnL~cI~. her symbols. Each Initiate must study, interpret, and develop the symbols for himself. For in all nges the proFoundest truths have been wisely covered From the common People as with a veil. By these, everywhere, ‘what was originally revered as the symbol of a higher Principle, became gradually confounded or identified with the object itself, and was worshipped ; until this proneness to error led to the most degraded forms of idolatry. And where, at the present day, they no longer wor - ship idols and images wade with the hands, they form and fashion ideas, images, and idols in their minds, which are not the Deity, nor like the Deity~ and worship tkcrn. The common notions of our own day are as absurd as those of Paganism; and in the vulgar mind the same efficacy is attributed to rites and ceremonies as at any time in the ancient world. Still it continues literally true that most men worship BanI, and not God. The mysteries were carried into every country, in order that, without disturbing the absurd popular be - lief, Truth, the Arts, and the Sciences, might be known io those who were capable of underst.nnding them, and to maintain the true or Sacred Doctrine incorrupt; which the people, prone to superstition and idolatry, have in no age been able to do; nor, as many strange aberrations and superstitions of the present cloy prove, any more now than heretorore.

You’ have now made the first three of the seven symbolic Circuits or journeys. To call them symbolic is to announce that they have a mystic meaning. You must discover this for yourself. Three Planets were deemed by the ancients to be above, and three below the Sun; and the natural order of all, proceeding upward from the earth, was deemed to be, The Moon, Mercury, Venus, The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. To these, in the ~zne order, were assigned the Seven Archangels, JSAPHJEL, RAPHAEL, H~QIALIEL, ZARAKIEL, AURIEL, GAI3RIEL, and MICHAEL. All these are combinations of one Hebrew word, AL, the name of the Deity originally worshipped by the Hebrews. * * LITURGY C. 4 In your first three Circuits, your soul has passed symbolically, in its ascent toward its home, through the spheres of &zturn, Venus, and Jupiter, called by the Hebrews Sabaiai, NogaA, and TdaJJc; symbolized by the metals, Lead~ C’o~per, and Tin; and their colors, Black, Blue, and &zrlet.

At the sphere of VEKUS, said the ancients, the Soul, ascending towards its home, shakes off its sen - sual appetites and passions. If it be not impossible to part with these in this life, it is at. leost impossible to do so, except by accepting that unnatural and artificial stagnation, that apathy and immobility, thnt emasculation of the Soul, which are the Death of all that is manly and heroic. The appetites, and passions are thc gifts of God, for good and wise purposes. .AJlowed to predominate and control, they become our Tyrants, and are frightful vices and leprous diseases of the Soul. Lust, and gluttony, and drunkenness, brutalize the Soul equally with the body, and make greatness and good - ness impossible. They turn Wisdom into Folly, and Intellect into Idiocy. They debauch, corrupt, and infect the whole man. But when the just equilibrium Is preserved between the appetites and passions, the moral sense and the Reason, the first are spurs and incentives to exertion, the springs of vigorous manli - ness, the sources or Love, Effort, and Heroism. Vice and Luxury have, In all ages, sapped the"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"TEE cIRCUITS. 273 foundations of States. Manliness and Virtue, the Family Affections, Temperance, Frugality, and Econ - omy, are the only sure preservatives of Republics. Debauchery and vice are a syphilitic poison in the arteries of a Commonwealth. Extravagance and luxury lead to dishonesty and peculation, aud to the prostitution of place and office; to lavish expendi - tures, oppressive debts, ruinous taxation, and the ultimate subjugation of Labor by Capital. Public corruption is the mother of private dishonesty. Re - pudiation, resorted to for relief, sanctions and en - courages private rascality, and the State becomes a great lazar-house of pestilence, rotten, like that poor debauchee, Louis XV., before its final dissolution.

Keep your appetites and passions ever under due control. Be not their slave, but their master.

At the sphere of JUPITER, the ascending Soul parted, it was said, with its avaricc. It is a vice which Civilization, Commerce, and Freedom largely develop. Wealth always tends, in prosperous States, to become the Supreme good, the highest merit, the aggregate of all the virtues; and Poverty to be less a misfortune than a misdemeanor. Inordinately mined, and giving power and consequence, Money becomes a God. 0 9 * * * * Avarice has, in all ages, been deemed an ignoble ilce.

He that doeth what is Right and True cometh to the Light, that his actions may be manifestly seen to accord with the Divine Will.” He who anciently received the Greater Mysteries was said to become a King and a Priest among men; an Intellectual Ruler, an Interpreter of the Divine. His duty was to dispense Light among the ignorant and uninformed. The Master Mason also is a Ruler among Masons, the Instructer and Guider of the Apprentices and Fellow-Crafts.

I will own 110 superior but the laws; nor bend the knee to any one but him who made me.” Death is not, by far, the greatest evil that can befall a man. To be - tray a trust, or violate an obligation, is a greater misfortune than to die. In defence of his own rights of free action, speech, and conscience, or or the civil and religious rights or his people, with the God or Armies on his side, the Mason will not fear the hour of trial ; “for though the hosts of his enemies should cover the field like locusts, yet the Sword of the Lord and or Gideon shall prevail.” You are about to pass, symbolically, through a scene of trial, of suffering, and of danger.

My Brother, we need not, as is sometimes done, tiresomely rehearse thc legend which has al - ready been enacted in your sight ond hearing. You cannot have failed to understand its literal import. We shall confine ourselves to such explanations as will point to the paths of study, travelling in which you may come, in time, fully to comprehend the neaning of this degree. The Word whispered in your ear is the substitute for the TRUE WORD of a Master. It contains a mys - tery ivhicli you may perhaps hereafter learn. IL is iaid to have been the first exclamation at the grave when the body had bcen uncovered, and it covers and contains the True Word. “Seek and ye shall find.” “ The Glory of God,” the Scripture saith, is, to conceal the Word.” “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was contained in God, and the Word was God.” In the French Rite, and also in the English Lodges, the substitute is . . . , which is composed of two Hebrew words, and means, “the place where the murdered one was concealed.” It Is said that when the third conspirator was on thE point or striking the Master, the latter threw his"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"FINAL lh5ThDCTIOlI. 813 hands up in front ot his forehead, with the palms outward, to protect his forehead against the blow, crying, “0 Lord, my God! is there no help for the son of the widow 1” Hence Masons are called Children of the Widow.” The seal found on the body of the Master HairGm was what is still known among the Arabs and the Hebrews of the Orient as the Light or Seal of Sala - mah. It is a circular plate of gold, of one-half this 0 size 9 and with the devices which you see here upon It. Like the Triangle inscribed within the Square (or 00 the face of a Cube), and the Pyramid, with its tour triangular sides, raised on a Cube as its bose, it points out the way, and givcs the clue by which the wise may discover the True Word."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"814 ImAL liuSnluurxoN. By the Square, the Egyptians symbolized matter, or the Womb of things ; by the Triangle, the genera - tive fire.

Jupiter was so represented at Corinth. Vul - can was symbolized by the pyratitid ; but it. i”as more exclusively (levoted to Diounsos, ApullOn, and the Sun.

All initiation is but introductory to the great change of death. Everything earthly must die. Man, like Qadipos, is wounded from his birth ; his real Elysinin can exist only beyond the grave.

The Hierophants of Samothrace assured those in - itiated into their mysteries, of the rewards reserved for the virtuous after death, by time justice of the Gods. In the mysteries of Eleusis, the Initiate was taught that the Soul was the whole of man; that earth was but his place of exile; that Heaven was his native country; that for the Soul to be born is really to die: and that death is for it to return to a new life.

Everywhere, also, this heroic and mythical persou— age pruui~~ii~ symbolized the Sui~, which, descend - ing southward in Autumu until he reached the Tropic of Capricorn at the Winter solstice, was said theta to die and be buried, for the few days that he seemed undetermined whether to continue to tend further aiuud fuu•ther southward, until he should leave the world in perpetual uuight, or to begin again to ascend toward the equator; and this ascent, after the sol - stice, was called his resurrection, aphanismn, or re - generation, and the salvation or the world from the malignant powers of darkness, cold, and evil.

So the Hebrew Genesis represents the BREATH or SPIRIT of God as brooding on the surface of the Chaos of matter, to create by generation, and mami was made male and female after the image of ALOHIM. Another division of nature has, in all oges, struck all men, and was not forgotten in the mysteries, that of Light and Dorkness, ever alternating, overcoming and overcome by turns; an apt symbol of the alter - nating preponderance of Good and Evil in the world, and in the soul of every man that lives. To the Initiates in the mysteries of Eleusis, as to those of Masonry, the spectacle of these two I’rinciples was exhibited, in the successive scenes or Darkness and Light which passed before their eyes. The fruit of the sufferings of the God, Fattier of Light and Souls, slain by the Chief of the Powers of Darkness, amid agaia restored to life, was gathered in the mysteries. “His. &atk works your salvation I” said the High 1’riest of MITERAS.

Life, rising out of death, wss the Great Mystery, which symbolism delighted to represent under a thousand ingenious forms. Nature was ransacked for attestazioii~ to the grand Truth, which seems to transcend all other gifts of imagination, or rather to be their essence and consummation. Such evidences were easily discovered. They were found in the olive and lotus, in the evergreen myrtle, in the deadly but self-renewing serpent, the wonderful and brilliant moth emerging from the coffin of the worm, in the Phcenix, born of its own ashes, the Scaraba3us, the phenomena of germination, the settings and us - ings of the Sun and Stars, the darkening and growth of the Moon, and Sleep, the minor Mystery of death.

The key to its meaning, and the reason for the selection of the Hero, are perhaps to be found in his name. That name, ordinarily rendered HIRAM, is, in the book or Kings, Khair~nt or Khairtim, but in that of Chronicles, KhirOui or Khiarnin.

Though often in political alliance with Egypt, the Hebrews borrowed less from that people than from Pl,~nicia, Assyria, and Persia. We find among them no Egyptian names of the Deity, no hieroglyphics, no similarity in language.

Connecting the legend of HUR6M with that of OsIRIS, by its hieroglyphical meaning, and also because the word Kkiir, in Hebrew, meant the Socket, or opening of the Eye, it symbolizes that true knowledge of the Deity which was taught in the mysteries, and is the LIGHT, of which the Mason travels in search. The Sun, Moon, Comet, and Seven Stars indicate the astronomical symbolism of the legend, and again connect it with that of Osiris. The Sun is Osiris, the Moon Isis, the Comet is a modern substitution in lieu of the five-pointed, or Blazing Star, which repro. sented Smics, A.KunIs, and HERMES. The Seven Stars are those of Ursa Major, or the Great Bear, which, connected with Bo~3TEs, or the HercZ~man, in - dicate that this Constellation also symbolized Osiris, and its disappearance in the ocean the death of that deity.

Sympathy is the co - hesive force that binds men together in Ordcrs and Societies ; and when It ceases to exist or is weakened, and Selfishness usurps upon it, the Order or the State draws nigh unto its end.
