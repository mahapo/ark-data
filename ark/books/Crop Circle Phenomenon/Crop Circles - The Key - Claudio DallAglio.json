After fifteen years of field research and hypotheses of each type, five years ago I finally managed to find the right path that brought me to the possible interpretation of the phenomenon. In fact the solution has always been there before my eyes but I could not see. Everyone in front of a mystery of this magnitude always think that th e solution is complicated but when you find the right way, everything is very simple. The day I found the solution it happened almost by accident, I was reading a book about esoteric symbolism and I stopped a moment to think, was there that I realized that I should look at the phenomenon of crop circles in its own body and not let misled by the complexity of the individual forms, each pictogram was too complex to be put in relation with another. Suddenly I realized that the message that everyone was puzzlin g to decipher anyway it was already cracked, just enough to read it right. For me the solution seemed so simple and disarming that I spent a couple of days to think it could not be easier, and that maybe I was wrong. As the days passed, however, I realized that the new theory that was emerging in my mind resisted any evidence and so I began to write. The book you hold in your hands you can ideally divide a three main parts: the search field, a big part of history, we will need to understand and give meaning to symbols, and finally the solution. Explain this with an article, a conference and, ultimately, a book was, for me, a big gamble. My colleagues in the Centro Culturale di Ricerche Esobilogiche Galileo warned me that it would be too complicated and peopl e who I wanted to reach (ie everyone) would never understand. The people I know , to which I say that I found an explanation of crop circles ( the real ones of course) , would like to hear in two words , impossible to do . With this book I hope to have been as comprehensive as possible, developing each topic to the end. Eventually you'll find that the bulk mechanism that holds, closed for at least three decades, the secret they are talking about the crop circles magically opens simply by inserting the key.

We were traveling on the motorway M4, which leads from the outskirts of London in the heart of the West of England, when finally, a s expected from our map, we found the exit 15 for Marlborough. We arrived well in the land of crop circles. We were on the main road A345 Wiltshire: our adventure was beginning. We left the hustle and bustle of the main artery road to immerse ourselves in a quiet and relaxing landscape, where the asphalt streets is mixed with tiny stones of the place so that its color, otherwise too dark, annoy the environment . We started well to travel to the south surrounded by countryside. To the right and left fields we re lost before their eyes and green and golden yellow color the environment of crops. Occasionally we saw some very characteristic red brick houses, adorned with flowers, who allowed all the heat that was inside. The sky was clear and the afternoon was slo wly giving way to the onset of evening. We were so fascinated by the scenery as the car slid on the surface smooth and free of bumps, walked eight miles almost breathless. The first country that we met on the road was Marlborough . Lead, suddenly, in that l ittle town, with many shops, cut in two by the road . This made us a little shock, and even if we were looking for a place to spend the night, we decided that it was not suitable and we went on. It was that decision, perhaps, we really opened the doors of a n enchanted place. Exit Marlborough was like going back to breathe. On either side of the road from time to time there were some very strong groups of trees and ancient carved on its bark that carried old stories of knights and swords. Just out of Marlboro ugh, in fact, is the tomb of Merlin, the last of the shamans, who according to legend \" spoke to the trees and communicated with the stones \" . Our trip in the middle of the mysteries had just started, we headed for Devizes and we were to meet something big. After about seven miles, in fact, we were stunned. We walked down a gentle curve to the west and against the light, we quickly came up a huge hill. On the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 right side of the road appeared t he Silbury Hill, as if emerged from a sea of emerald green. It is a conical pyramid, built entirely by hand, dating back to 2700 BC. What until a few days before we had seen in books, who spoke of Wiltshire now materializing before our eyes. The thing that increased the surprise was to find it beside the main road until you see a place on a road map or reproduced in photos not you realize how it really is. This was when I stopped short on the left, I opened the car door and got out. I was stopped for a moment staring at that huge hill with bated breath. We were admiring what is the core of the phenomenon of crop circles. Then I could not imagine the importance it would have been after for my research. Perhaps we should have been huge, but that work hours watching the sun was telling us that his task for the day was ending and we still had to find a place to stay. So we moved on and, hopefully, take the first turning for Devizes. There, according to what they said the tourist information at Heathrow Airport, we would surely find a bed and breakfast or hotel. After about nin e miles we entered the entrance of the village. Devizes is a small residential town very warm and quiet. In contrast to Marlborough, there are few shops, if not in the center, and the decor is very traditional road and rich floral ornaments. The town deser ved to be observed in detail, but at that moment was urgent to find accommodation for the night. We were directed to a pub called the White Horse, coincidentally the place was called just as the huge white horses \"engraved\" on the hills of that area. It wa s a sign of destiny? I discovered shortly thereafter, when we entered the small pub and asked for a room. The owner made a phone call and told us to wait a moment. Shortly after he entered the room a man of forty years who asked those interested in a room. We did forward. It was Mike , a nice English gentleman who took us to his home, not far from the pub. On the doorstep stood there waiting for his wife Colleen who greeted us with two of their four children, as if we were family. The next morning began ou r adventure in crop circles. While Colleen was bringing us the breakfast we meditated to ask her information on the phenomenon. We had some concerns with her to talk of a phenomenon so strange, but she lived in that area and it was the most suitable , perha ps it was also very informed. Normally in Italy when it comes to this stuff with a mature person there is the risk of being looked with a smile. Colleen was rather surprised to talk to foreign people in the area of facts that were closely guarded among the locals. And so, passionately, he told us how they saw it the phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"9 The people of Wiltshire are used for many years the phenomenon of crop circles so that for them the mystery is easily accepted . I am very happy to talk to someone so worked up that e very time they're told of the arrival of a new formation . For them , know a new crop circle , it's like hearing about of the birth of a child . They want , therefore, to know immediately where it is, mark it and then go to see him at leisure during the weekend with family and friends . If you try , then, to ask their opinion, who or what it can do crop circles have different responses : the land forces , magnetic fields or extraterrestrial technologies . Do not try to speculate , however, that there is some joker beh ind the hand because you will be laughed at and looked down from above . Exactly the same reaction you had in Italy if someone associated with the crop circles to alien technology . Colleen , then showed us a pub near Alton Barnes , on the road that leads to A llington Pewsey , which is called \" The Barge Inn\" . This is a very popular local area because it is a central repository for all reports of crop circles . There you can find different people to talk to the phenomenon , because there is in the back seat of the \" Study Group of the Wiltshire Crop Circles \" ( WCCSG). So it was that after a rich English breakfast we loaded all the equipment in the car and the first thing we headed to Alton Barnes . Our first day in Wiltshire was accompanied , early in the morning , a bri ght sun and as Colleen said it was very rare in these parts , we realize the next few days . We entered the A361 coming out of Devizes and then, after about a couple of miles , we found the right fork to Allington . The car went along the road, which rose and fell sinuously modeling the rolling hills of the area , the English call \" downs\". In fact, the county of Wiltshire , like the rest of the south of England, is characterized by a slightly hilly landscape . The streets in this area are , depending on the time , o n a hill or a valley . This makes the landscape look very different and ideal for crop circles . When we planned this trip was only a hope being able to find even a crop circle , considered him to be a remote possibility . It was for this reason , perhaps, tha t we were abundantly rewarded as soon as we walked in search of , only some information . During the trip from Devizes I told my wife to take a look around , if there was any figure in a field. We had just left behind Bishops Cannings , and we were about to p ass by the agglomeration of houses which took its name Allington . After a while , looking to her left , she started screaming that there was a figure on the field in the middle of the hill we were coasting . It seemed impossible , but once we managed to find a crop circle . I found a clearing just stopped the car , we happened right in front of a dirt road leading up the hill. The entrance was barred by a huge gate bearing the sign \"private property \". There we found a car parked in front and some guys who"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"10 told us that what we saw on the field was a \" good\" training. We discovered afterwards that it was the crop circle called \"The Escher Cube \", we'll see . We spent about four hours on that golden field and sunny and found that the field beside it , a few hundred mete rs , there was another training: at once we saw two crop circles . And so , thirsty and hot, we resumed the march towards Alton Barnes . We drove through the intersection of Allcannings , then Stanton St. Bernard , to finally arrive at their destination . The \"Ba rge Inn\" is Honeystreet, a cluster of houses south of Alton Barnes. It is not what you say an easy place to find, but has the advantage of being known by a multitude of people. From the intersection of Alton Barnes takes in the south, a road that, at some point, crosses the Kennet & Avon Canal, a waterway that runs through the north Wiltshire, and then turn immediately right onto a narrow dirt road going to emerge in a large clearing. Here we are. Once you park your car, if time permits, we are faced with a series of tables set outside, with people eating and drinking, especially in summer. Behind them, on a two - story building is the sign \"The Barge Inn\" (Fig. 1). Next to the place, in fact, runs the waterway, and the background to the north, you see the \"wh ite horse\" by Alton Barnes \"lying\" on the hill. Fig.1 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"11 We went to quench our thirst with a few drinks , but our thirst was not only physical , we were , in fact, looking for information . Once inside, the pub looks like any other typical restaurant English . If it were not , however, who feel that the speeches , guests of the people , have in common words such as circles or formations . You see , then, some people who wear T - shirts drawn over the crop circles , we found out later that they were belonging to WCCSG . Just go to the back , however, to discover the soul of the place. In the back , in fact, there is a room ( Fig. 2) with the center , a small pool table and all around photos and drawings of formations that have appeared in the fields of the county and beyond. The ceiling and upper walls are painted with the image of the archaeological site of Stonehenge and a set of drawings that recall the most beautiful crop circles that appeared in the past , all carefully painted in green on a yellow background . Fig. 2 The most interesting part of the room , however, is the wall where the panel with the map of the area ( Fig. 3). The latter collects all the findings of crop circles this year and previous years , marked with dots of different color applied to the panel. In order to take pictures inside the room we had to bid for research against cancer , as the sign said . From that room we went with a large amount of information . We found out how it was called the crop circle we had just visited (\" Escher Cube \") and that there were several figures in the county that could still visit . For example , two days"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 before our arrival was a formation appeared not far from the \" Barge Inn\", within walking distance. A little ' further east, however , had just been discovered a figure that was below the promontory of Cherhill , which no one had photographed , which existed only a few drawings hanging on the bulletin board of the \" Barge Inn\". Below the hill Hackpen Hill , then a little ' more dated, there appeared a beautiful and fascinating design that intrigued us and we scored a lot in my travel together with others. Fig. 3 Leaving the \" Barge Inn\" walked on foot and entered a few fields in the formation of which was given the name of the same pub ( Fig. 4 to 7) . There we found several people who were analyzing the crop circle . Some of these used"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"13 the copper divining rods in an attempt to discover some \"force \". Others, however , were seated at a particular point , with eyes closed in meditation . Most of the people who were on that field , h owever, were fans , then we discovered , are found in all formations . Some of these people invited us to spend evenings in the formations . That evening , for example, held a kind of party , inside a crop circle that appeared a few weeks before at East Field . W e declined the invitation, our interest in crop circles was more scientific folklore . Fig. 4 "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"14 Fig. 5 Fig. 6 "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"15 Fig. 7 Fortunately, however , also found people who dealt with the topic as we treated him . For example, a middle - aged gentleman who was in the drawing with his dog . This was astonished to hear that coming from Italy and beyond that , we, we treated the topic \" crop circles\". Then he explained that he was organizing a conference for next week , not far from there . He pointed , also, di fferent formations to visit. After the knowledge we started training hard to analyze , collect samples of ears and do some photos . Passed about an hour the sun was down , giving relief to our skin , now red, and causing the lengthening shadows of all those pr esent on that field . It was time to go back . So we resumed the car , after having carefully deposited the material collected in the trunk , and we walked to our accommodation . The road was now dark , and also everything that was around . We noticed , so that in that area at night , there is no light for miles . The only lights were our source of light that were off the bituminous road going to illuminate the reflectors are sunk into the white center line . After driving with some effort for about eight miles we arr ived in Devizes . While returning to our apartment we met Colleen asked , with interest, as the day went and how many crop circles had seen. She wanted to know the exact position of the figures because we had visited in the weekend , would load the kids in th e station wagon and would take them to see in place . He noticed then surprised our tan, we were under the sun for more than four hours . He told us"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 that in the following days we would not have had so much luck with time . As we had said that morning , it was rare in England , find a sunny day . We went back to our accommodation, we had to rest, to gather ideas and take stock of the situation . The day just passed had gone beyond our wildest expectations , we saw three crop circles , and we did not even fully aware . We thought that we would have aroused the wonder in the telling of our adventures , once back in Italy . I was feeling satisfied by what we had collected , but the holiday was still long and the opportunity to experience other was too tempting to pass up . In the end , in fact, our booty came to sixteen crop circles .

Staying home and connecting to the interne t is very easy to get information about crop circles .

This painstaking work is done by passionate people who , every day , coll ect reports of people who have seen something , go in person to verify and then , at least once a week , hire a helicopter or a plane to go to the photo shoot we find on the website or bulletin board to hang the Barge Inn . The English talk about crop circles or, for convenience , the crops , while the Italians call them crop circles , pictograms or agriglyphs . All these words are used to identify these huge drawings that appear on the fields across the world for over thirty years and still remain a fascinating m ystery. July 18, 1999 Find a crop circle in Wiltshire is not something very difficult. When my wife spotted the '\" Escher Cube \" from the car we realized that in that area , if you see a spot in a field it is almost certainly a crop circle. In fact the parti cular hardness of the grain that grows in the south of England means that it does not bend with the wind and rain , as happens for example in Italy . We were at Allington , near Bishop's Cannings , when we got off the car could be seen in the figure , about a h undred and fifty - two hundred meters from us ( Fig. 1) , halfway up the hill . Our view was rather inclined and did not understand well what they were drawing . So by extracting , by one of the bags , binoculars for a better look . It was a circular shape with som e very clear rectangles inside of it. The scene was perfect, the huge field of wheat under the sun shone as if it were gold , and all around the nearby fields , an emerald green color , were his frame. The sky was clear and just a slight breeze stirred the tr eetops ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"19 Fig 1 Beside the field there was a dirt road that led from the highest part of the down , blocked by a huge gate that bore the words \"private property \". On the left there was a sign with the name of the farm owner of the land . While we were unloa ding our bags to arrive with the equipment we saw a big jeep that came from a man who went to open the gate. So I approached and, after greeting him , I told him that we were researchers and asked if it was possible to enter the field to study the formation that had appeared . He just snorted and then after a time , granted us permission . He probably already had many requests like that , previously , as the crop circles dating back to June Twenty - six of that year . We walked , well , on the hill , the path to do was long and the road was gravel . Before getting stared at each well point where the pictogram was because the road was lower than the field. Furthermore, between the dirt road and the ground there were shrubs, a small moat and barbed wire. All this disturbed the eye into the picture . Our intention was to take the road up to the height of the crop circle and then , advancing into the field to enter. The sun was overhead , its rays struck, without interruption , our skin and the white limestone of the embankment , making it shine as to be almost blinding . The climb up the hill seemed to never end. Occasionally we stopped to scan the field to control how high we were compared to that of the drawing. However, the reference that we had before going was still far from s ight. So, while we put one foot before the other, we reflected on the appearance of crop circles on British soil. We noted in particular that the designs that are found are not always at hand. As in this case, for example, must look for them, looking out, including the nuances of the hills. Then, once identified, must be a hard time seeing them up close."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 On the side of an outside observer that connects to the site of \" cropcircleconnector\" it seems very simple : you park your car , you enter the field and do the analysis . Keep in mind , however , a very important aspect : who is \" surfing\" the Internet has aerial photos to hand while he who is on - site has a completely different visual references . The backpacks slung over shoulders were beginning to feel their wei ght. Within them we had minimal equipment : a pair of binoculars , two cameras , a tripod, a compass , a portable audio recorder , a magnetic field detector and a few small containers for soil samples . The climb was steady , although not too pendulous, and there was a shadow , we could accommodate only a few minutes . On the other hand, the area where we were was completely covered with fields and trees were planted along roadsides or concentrated in small woods . After walking for about twenty minutes we reached th e vicinity of the reference that we had mentally marked . It was time to try to enter the field, and so we looked toward the ground , between two shrubs . In front of us saw , very obliquely, the pictogram . That which, being on the road , seemed a walk turned o ut to be more complicated enterprise . In fact , in order to enter into the picture, we had to take at least another fifty - sixty meters walk inside the ears . We studied the situation and then we discovered that there was a way not to step on all the ears t hat separated us from the crop circle. In England , as in other countries of the world , the fields are planted with large machines . During the sowing , where they spend the wheels of these machines are not deposited the grains and thus form the double - lane, down the field. These \" lanes\" of passage are called by experts \"tram - lines\" ( Fig. 2) , because the provision is very similar to that of a city tram tracks . Each pair of \"tram - lines\" is about twenty meters from the next ."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"21 Fig 2 Then it was time to enter t he field. Between us and the golden sea of wheat, which shone in the sun, there was a fence of barbed wire, that because of the difference caused by a moat, was higher than it seemed. We had overtake, not without effort, the barbed wire entanglement. We w ere, therefore, among the wheat, who there was whipping his legs despite the long trousers. We stepped on the wheat with our feet and , with our amazement, the plants come back immediately stand up. As already mentioned, the English wheat is much harder tha n Italian, for example. Once ready we made some steps in the wheat, which crackled. So we taking the first tram - line help. Walk on the lane seemed much easier. The plants of wheat were arriving at the hips, all standing around evenly. It seemed to be immer sed in a golden sea. After walking for about thirty meters we stopped because the pictogram had gone out of our sight. Basicly, cause the field, we were so much in line with the image that we could not see the edges. It seemed a very strange, being so clos e to an image so large and fail to see it. The silence were around us and only the wind, from time to time, was heard with its rhythmic gusts. There remained but to proceed along the tram line trusting that we would've arrive into the figure, as it seemed from the outside."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 We walked for a while and, at the end, that corridor, formed by two walls of wheat, opened on a huge open space. Before us there was a perfect expanse of plants, all folded in the same direction. The emotion was very strong, we could not believe our eyes. Finally we were inside a crop circle! (Fig. 3) Fig 3 The euphoria we were taking the hand. The first impression I had on seeing that immense design was that it was a form of expression based on \"full - empty\", the play between the posit ive and negative . Standing on the field, in fact, we see a vast expanse of wheat, which is perceived as a single mass of gold, and a huge low neat and perfect. These two elements together create an impressive contrast. We were stunned for a while, there we re several things we needed to check, as in the manual, including to understand wich figure was. To begin, we walked along the perimeter to make us a general idea of what we had before us (Fig. 4). So it was that we had been confirmed that it was a circula r shape. In fact, the outer edge was made by a thickness ring of about four meters. Inside of that, the plants of wheat were bent in only one direction, clockwise ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"23 Fig 4 Then, when we entered, the picture became more complex. There were, in fact, three L - shaped areas that had plants all oriented toward the outside of the figure. It was as from a center to go out. From where we were was difficult to reach the center of the figure because of \"nervousness\" of the plants, all combed in the same direction. I t was a bit 'like walking uphill with every step we were well to lift the foot off the ground to avoid falling on the sheaf of wheat. We found out later that he was so from whichever direction you were trying to gain the center. When we arrived we found ou t in the middle of the central point from where it all started. You could see a flurry of corn on the ground, which, widening gradually, came to form a triangle. From this figure there are three \"lanes\", each about eight meters wide, placed exactly 120 ° a part. At that point, however, there was much confusion in our minds, we could not understand wich figure was. As the sun continued to pound our skin we brings us back to the edge of the figure to get a better overview. Since the camp was on a slight slope, we chose the highest part. Seen from there, the figure looked like a triple swastika, such as those Oriental depicting the perfect balance. It was time to analyze the plants. (Fig. 5)"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"24 Fig 5 Fig 6 Normally, in a crop circle, the wheat is folded at t he first or second node above ground: the plant of wheat on its stem has four nodes, it is a swelling in the stem at regular intervals that need to be able to move and circulate the life - blood."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"25 Immediately we noticed a very strange thing, for the knowledge that we had from the literature on crop circles. All the plants, of that figure, had the last part of the stem above ground, (the last node) bent about 30 ° upwards. We noted this fact on the audio recorder. For us it was a novelty, because we did not kno w that the formation of pictogram was dated back to about a month before. All plants normally respond to the law of gravitropism (Fig. 6). Once you are bent tend, of course, to come back erected, to receive, in the best way the sunlight. This was proof tha t plants of this crop circle had not been bent with a plank and a rope, which would inevitably be broken, but which were still intact and were carrying out their natural life cycle. Only gonig up the hill, that was higher, we learned why the figure in the field was called \"Escher Cube\" (Fig. 6a). Fig 6a "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26 How? Now we analyze how they form a crop circle and what creates this. The average of all the evidence, so far acquired, the witness, usually sees an object shaped like a sphere, which shines its light (with a diameter of about 50/60cm), which comes from unidentified flying objects disc - shaped, triangular or quadrangular. The ball of light flying over the field for a very short time, not more than thirty seconds / one minute in total and then walks away. During this time the person sees the crop that seems to catch fire (Fig. 7), as the air moves in full sun on the asphalt of a summer afternoon. Then when approaching the ground is hot, but the stalks are intact lying on the ground (Fig. 8). Fig 7 "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"27 Fig 8 Researchers most reliable over the years have compiled a list of frequently occurring disturbances observed on the spikes and on the ground affected by the phenomenon of crop circles that we see below (Fig. 9). Fig 9"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"28 From what we unde rstand, with years of research, what physically creates a crop circle is a wave that propagates at about 4 meters above the ground up to 170 meters from the edge of the figure, horizontal, gradually decreasing . As if it were a shock wave caused by an expl osion (Fig. 8). Fig 10 ( photo © Dr. Giorgio Pattera) Elongation of the nodes This means that the plants of wheat are concerned, from above, from a heat that, starting from the kernels (Fig. 10), reduces the moisture and dry the grains. Just below, the sap contained in the stem is in boiling and send the plant in pressure. So it happens that the weakest parts of the plant, nodes, suffering the consequences. In fact, the first node, called the apical node, take thickens and has an abnormal length. The se cond and third node, however, comes the explosion if the plant is already ripe become most long, as the apical node, if you are in the presence of a spike is still green (Fig. 11). The intense heat, then, means that the paraffin that covers the plant melts , producing an effect s imilar to that of flypaper. Is for this reason that the pictograms authentic (real, as the English say), not created by human hand (man made), insects are often stuck to the stems. analyses control"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"29 Fig 11 The phenomenon of insects trapped In this regard it is worth mentioning the research conducted by the Dutch Janet Ossebaard on the phenomenon of dead flies inside crop circles. She found that, for the effect of the wave of heat, the flies remained stunned, but in some cases not death, and the beak s and feet remained glued to the parts of the plant (Fig. 12). Sometimes, in fact, just remove it gently to make them fly again. Fig 12( photos : over © Dr. Uwe Engelmann, under © Janet Ossebaard) The paraffin melts of the plant creating a \" flypaper.\" The flies do not die immediately but remain stunned Temperatures around the 800/1000 ° C for a few second s"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"30 The silica microspheres Another effect, due probably to the heat, is that of the silica microspheres that are found on the stem and leaves of the plant which is located within a agriglyphs. These silica spheres with a diameter of 5 microns (5 nm), which can be seen with a microscope (Fig. 13). This was noticed for the first time by Dr. William Levengood of american team BLT and Dr. Haseloff Eltjo from Philips Research Laboratories in the Netherlands. These are tiny perfectly round spheres unlike the common silicon dioxide, which solidifies into solid amorphous form. The thing that has intrigued researchers is who had not seen any surface imperfections. Fig 13 ( photo © Dr. William Levengood) The meteoric dust and magnetite Every day the meteor dust falls slowly from the atmosphere and is deposited on land r eaching a maximum nominal amount of 0.4 mg per gram. In crop circles this value varies from 20 to 250 mg per gram. It is, therefore, to a value of six hundred times higher than normal. This means that the formation of a pictogram causes an effect that look s very much like a huge magnet that attracts the meteoric dust in one place. The BLT Research has found, moreover, cases in which the deposit was fused along with magnetite (Fig. 14).

After removing several stsamples of plants and ground the three discover that the plants and the surface of the ground they had recorded trauma, in particular the ground was very dry and dry. As a result, the analysis of soil samples, made in San Diego (California) in a laboratory specializing in difrattometria(XRD), showed that the mica crystals of content in the soil and su bjected to heat, had undergone a change as if they had been subjected for several hours at a temperature between 600 and 800 degrees Celsius.

In several cases, witnesses who h ave witnessed the emergence of a crop circle, spoke of a latent heat, when it reaches the place affected by the folding of the ears. We understood, however, to what temperature we talked about when the phenomenon in question has interested a land rich in c lay containing crystals of mica, which has a basic component as the silicon. In the glass industries , the silicon, a basic component of glass is melted at over 1000 degrees Celsius to obtain a dough that can be worked. As you can see from this case, an in tense heat combined with an intelligent force components are the basis for the creation of a pictogram. The Protocol 2007 version Knowing all this information has helped us a lot to analyze the phenomenon, but when the crop circles, with all their com plexity, have arrived in Italy, in 2003, we were a little caught by surprise: we had a lot of material to be analyzed but not we were \"educated\" to collect the data properly. So yours truly tried to \"build\" a \"research protocol\" that would facilitate the t ask to people who were on the field to collect samples. He was born, so, the \"Protocol Version field surveys Crop Circles 1\", written by me in collaboration with the Scientific Coordinator of the Italian National UFO Center, Dr. Pattera. It was the fusion of my experience, made on English fields, and the scientific basis of study on the ground traces of unidentified flying objects accumulated over the years by Dr. Pattera. Through some improvements, then we arrived at the version 2 and then 3. With this I realized that the Protocol could be an instrument which, if adopted by all, would help us enormously in the separation between the genuine crop circles and the artifacts, which is the starting point for studying the symbology and the message contained the rein. Thus, knowing the Cropcircleconnector Mark Fussel (the largest international site on the phenomenon of crop circles), I asked to publish the Protocol on the International News translated into English. The Protocol, however, don't took off, was not us ed to its full potential. To disseminate at the best the protocol, I published it on several other sites, on the italian magazin UFO Notiziario (number 54 of 2005) and at the same time I sent via email to all the accredited international researchers.

Her e - mail was fu ll of proposals, was very interested and wanted to Research Protocol contribute with their own ideas. Communicate and reason by e - mail with Nancy, though, it was not easy, and so we met in Milan during a \"tour\" of conferences in Italy and we discussed, onl y the research methodology, for over an hour. It was enough to get to roll out a new protocol more detailed and easier to use for any researcher. When we parted he told us \"... you're doing an unprecedented job!

In that case, after due analysis established that the crop circle in question was an artifact, a stunt of a group of boys who, moreover, also began to sell commemorat ive T - shirts off the field. The battery of my phone, however, was a bit 'dated and, I discovered that day that don't signaled the charge well. If that day I trusted of my phone I would have committed a glaring mistake. July 23, 1999 When we visited th e pictogram Cher Hill, in Wiltshire, (one of the newer ones that had been made at that time) during the field analysis we recorded with a stereo microphone, a waveform of 1.22 kHz, which was unknown, to the above the background noise. This was a test we us ed often because it was part of all the routine tests that are done inside a crop circle, with a portable sound recorder was sufficient to remain silent and recorder the empty. On that occasion I felt, in the headphones, a shrill whistle that was increasin g in intensity as they approached with the microphone to the ground, we found the same sound in the others crop circles, but the wind is have often disturbed the recordings. It seemed, however, an audio track on a different channel than the surrounding sou nd. For about a year I presented the discovery in some conferences corroborating what had happened to a crew of British television (BBC) that at the time with a professional camera recorded a wave of 5.5 kHz. Later, at the end of 2000, we had the good fort une to know Professor Vedruccio, engineer and professor at the University of Urbino, who is interested in this phenomenon, and he invited us at his laboratory. There we were able to recreate the \"experience\" with the recorder used in England, to see, there fore, possible interference from the device and test the veracity of what we found."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"37 In the graph above we can see how it develops the wave, recorded by us in England, compared to background noise (all on the left of the graph).

As you can see there is no frequency near the 1.2 khz. At this point one could say that the waves recorded in England i s \"valid\" and our unit has detected something \"good.\" But to ensure that the recorder does not emit anything that could influence the outcome we worked in the laboratory, even with another microphone, external to the system, capable of recording magnetic e missions."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"38 The axes above show the phenomenon of \"feedback\" produced by our recorder measurably in 1.2 kHz. So the result is zero. In practice, the microphone of our equipment had issued an electromagnetic wave, that bouncing off the ears of corn bent to the ground (containing silicon), that returned to the microphone in the form of sound. In fact, the plane of ears causes a concentration effect of the waves, because the stems, close to one another, are like a \"wall\" that causes a rebound of any wave. From this \"experience\", then, we understood that any person has registered something inside a crop circle has not registered more than one \"feedback\". It's the same even the recording made by the BBC crew, which had recorded a wave of 5.5 kHz. In fact, using a microphone more powerful, with a \"pass band\" wider, the effect of \"feedback\" can also cause a wave of 5.5 kHz These results were made public at the \"9th World Symposium on unidentified flying objects\" of San Marino (held on 17 - 18 March 2001) for voice of Prof. Clarbruno Vedruccio.

Our direction was Silbury Hill, the archaeological site that left us literally speechless just two days before. It is a conical hill of 140 meters in diameter with an height of 44 meters of limestone made entirely by hand. The official dating said that was built in 2700 BC. We arrived in the parking lot, slightly raised above the support surface of this vast structure of emerald green. When we looked on the field upon which is set we could look at it in its entirety; six tiers of limestone that have been melted with time, making it a perfect conical hill with the tip cut off. The pictures of this strange \"thing\" does not do it justice as it is massive and overlying, to remain literally breathless. At that time we did not know that this hill, abandoned to the passing of time, would help us in solving the mystery. After staying there, in contemplation, for few minutes we headed for walk along the main road, which is located at the same level of the parki ng lot and offers the possibility of starting to climb the hill, saving quite a few meters. We climbed the path that runs round the top for almost three quarters of a circle. The wind struck us making the climb more complicated but, having reached the top, we were rewarded the effort. A large and grassy platform constitutes the tip of Silbury Hill, creating a big balcony to observe the surrounding landscape. From that hill you can see: the village of Avebury, the junction of Beckhampton, the West Kennet lo ng barrow and all th e fields around far as the eye. That site is also an excellent observation point to see crop circles, which appear in the nearby fields."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"41 Fig 1 In fact, at the foot of Silbury Hill, we have found the crop circle appeared almost a mon th before, depicting the \"winged globe\", a symbol that is a little in all cultures: from the Sumerian to the Egyptian and the Roman. Passed around six years since that day I knew better that the symbolism that was handed down in history could have a connec tion with the phenomenon of crop circles. It was from that moment that I began the journey that brought me up here."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"42 Before that I had traveled all the possible ways but none had proved satisfactory, neither explained fully and in a meaningful way a phenome non that seemed so complex. I tried all the scientific disciplines from physics to chemistry to cellular biology. Then I passed also trough the astronomy and physics: theory of general relativity, string theory, blacks holes and, therefore, non - Euclidean g eometry, for what concerns the curvature of space - time. Basically I tried everything that could bind to a graphical representation and then the crop circles. At the end all those wonderful drawings could represent anything was connected to an event happe ned, that was happening or who was going to happen. All over this research I never gave too much weight to the story, which turned out to be the right way to go. What made me take the right path was that, by analyzing dozens of pictograms, I found the symbols, which were repeated in various forms, which came from different ancient cultures . This thing let me very curious and, gradually that I discovered the mean ing, I continued to backdate the origin. My path it was going in backwards, I realized that the most important symbols we use and see every day are simply the result of cultural sedimentation. Each symbol is the result of a superposition of different cultu res and continuing to dig ideally, as doing an archaeologist, it brings to light the primary essence of that representation to discover its origins. From there I began to think that crop circles had to speak a language very ancient that it was worth transl ating. As you study at school, the culture began in the Middle East, in the area crossed by two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, which is called Mesopotamia. It was from there that I began. I went to look for all those authors who knew the Sumerian s tory and were able to translate the ancient writing on the clay tablets. As can be seen in the bibliography, one of the authors who gave me more credit was, the now deceased, Zecharia Sitchin, expert of numerous Sumerian dialects and author of thirteen boo ks on the subject. Sitchin was much criticized for his extreme theories but the thing that convinced me is that this author has cited y our sources of what he wrote. H owever, I have never been content to make the necessary checks but I also tried the source s that were completely outside of the argument and with which I could compare the data. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"43 The Sumerian Genesis 45 0 thousand years ago, according to the Sumerian mythology. En.ki (the Lord of the Earth), coming from the planet Ni.bi.ru, landed on earth in search of a very precious material for the survival of his world, the gold. The landing site was in Mesopotamia, the land between two rivers, which today is called Iraq. The Sumerian Scriptures tell their own story of that distant planet, which should b e part of our solar system, which travels a highly elliptical orbit and crosses our region of space every 3600 years. Once he had certain that the gold deposits could meet the needs of their planet, En.ki he and his entourage landed on earth. The delegatio n Anun.na.ki, so those were called who came to earth to colonize that part of our planet, once settled in Mesopotamia and, later, also in central Africa to extract the precious metal from which the life depended on their world. The planet Ni.bi.ru in fact, which in Sumerian means \"planet of crossing\", needed some gold for the containment of its atmosphere, that was had thinned. The scientific part of the mission was under the command of En.ki (Fig. 2), the Lord of the Earth, while the general command was En .lil, the Lord of command, precisely. The two gentlemen came from a noble family of their planet whose father was the ruler of . En.ki was the eldest , however, born by a concubine while En.lil, the second son, born by his wife of the king and so, by righ t of descent, has obtained the command (Fig. 3).

"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"45 The birth of the man In Sumerian mythology says that Anun.na.ki (those who came down to earth) after several millennia of digging for gold mining in central Africa rebelled and asked for help. The Lord of the Earth decided to \"create\" an aide, a being who could guarantee a workforce adequate to the task. From a genetic basis already present on the earth, a hominid that was in Central Africa, was thus created man combining the Anun.na.ki seed with t he biological material on Earth. In the iconography below (Fig. 4) we can see Ni.mah that takes the first baby on her knees. Fig 4 – The birth of the man In reality it was not so easy, the first man did not came to light so quickly, it took several att empts and several errors. Females Anun.na.ki who offered for the success of the experiment have had several problems before getting the purpose. The substance, however, was that man was created in the laboratory to help the gentlemen who came from heaven i n their purpose, but be careful, man was conceived, at the beginning, not as slave but as a sentient being capable of to want, understanding and to learn. These were the intentions of En.ki, the proponent of the project, which never met the approval of his brother, \"the Lord of the command\". In the Egyptian Genesis it comes to Ptah (En.ki in Sumerian) as of the creator, that the Egyptians were saying coming from an eastern city called Ur (which in Sumerian means, precisely, the city). In Figure 5 we see po rtraits En.ki En.lil and the sides of the tree of life. On the left side we can notice En.ki with one hand attached to a branch of what could be construed as a representation of the DNA or the tree of life.

In various cultures of t he world the word An means sky. On the sides of the two brothers, then you can see two \"attendants\" winged, representing their respective following . I open a small parenthesis, the representation of the beings with wings doesn't mean that they really have them, but that they could get up in the air, even in a different way. We have to think as an Sumerian scribe that the only way he knew to represent the flight was to sculpt the wings of a bird, because he don't no knew other. Fig 5 – The Tree of Life On the subject of human creation, it was not enough to me the Sitchin's interpretation and some other authors, but I also wanted to hear the bell of genetics. So I found the research by Bryan Sykes, Professor of Human Genetics at Oxford, who conducted a s tudy on human mitochondrial DNA. After years of research he was able to discover that the mitochondrial DNA of the whole human race is descended from a single female (called by scientists Mitochondrial Eve) lived in southern Africa between 120,000 and 150, 000 years ago. This research is contained in a book called \"The Seven Daughters of Eve\". The Sumerian mythology places the birth of the man at about 130,000 years ago. This finding left me quite amazed, it meant that what was left engraved in cuneiform on clay tablets by the Sumerians is a scientific evidence, today, in genetics. So I had a major impulse to continue my research, ancient history was proving to be the very source of knowledge that could lead to the understanding of the message contained in th e crop circles of the ours days."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"47 Now, the goal was to understand how it had gone really human history and how the knowledge was handed down. The Bible tells us that Adam and Eve were created by God and placed then in the garden of Eden. The Sumerians, how ever, says something substantially similar, but the facts are presented to us in a different way. As we saw earlier, the cuneiform writings tell us that after several steps and errors, the Man was obtained genetically. Following were created two examples, Adam and Ti.amat, who lived for a time in the E.din (the House of the Righteous, then translated Eden). The two beings, male and female, were not able to reproduce and so, after some time En.ki decided to change their bodies so that they were \"independent \". You probably explains the interpretation of the Bible that speaks of the temptation of the serpent, the apple (original sin) and the expulsion from Paradise. In fact, the Lord of Command (En.lil), which already did not approve the creation of a new can be, was very angry when he discovered that the two guests of E. Din were able to reproduce themselves and wished them away from his sight. I pause a moment on the episode; the Christian Catholic iconography will identify always the snake or Satan as the t empter. In Hebrew El - satan has the meaning of \"opposite\", the one who is opposed to God as we shall see later En.lil had somehow the cultural windward on En.ki, even for their degree, and there was always a struggle direct or indirect, between the two. But because it was always used the snake and not another animal? This has probably b een due to how the Anun.na.ki were looked . The sculptures that portray them in detail represented them macrocephalic with slanted eyes. This probably made them resemble the reptiles and then snakes (Fig. 6). Fig 6"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"48 Fig 7 We continue the story of the Sumerian genesis. Adam and Ti.Amat (Eve) generated two females that , of course, could not carry on the species. So En.Ki intervened, stayed with them and so were born Adapa and Titi who gave abundantly pulse at the human race. From them born Cain and Abel, who ended as we all know. Cain, for that he did, he was sent into exile in South East Asia and his beard was removed genetically, at that time were a symbol of wisdom. In fact, if we pay attention, all the inhabitants of India and South Asian cou ntries are, for the most part, without beard , then, until today, the races are been mixed. Adapa and Titi have had 30 other sons and 30 daughters (fig. 7) but also gave birth to an important lineage. In fact, with Sati the race it's arrived until Enoch. T hese became known for the famous \"Books\", it was also called Enki - me, one that understand the Me (a kind of disks in which the knowledge was contained Anun.na.ki). It is worth pausing a moment on this character, because Enoch was in contact with the gods a nd was equipped with a superior knowledge.

And his body was white as snow and red as a rose, and his curly hair white and be autiful as the white wool, and when his eyes were opened, the whole house was shining as per the sunlight, and his father Lamech was afraid of him fled, and went to Methuselah, his father, and said: I have generated a strange son. It's not like any other human being, but it seems to me the son of the angels of heaven, because he looks different, and he is not like us. I do not think is my son, but of the angels .....\" As is clear from this passage, there was another intervention of the god En.ki that mad e sure a lineage of excellence coming from his blood (Fig. 7). T he Deluge Even to Ziusudra En.ki gave the knowledge. The choice was forced, in fact, the Anun.na.ki knew that soon there would be a great flood caused, it is thought, by a sudden thaw (perh aps for the passage of Ni.bi.ru in the solar system). For this En.lil take the opportunity to eliminate the race \"terrestrial\" from the face of the planet and order that all Anun.na.ki must retire with their ships in orbit and that all the inhabitants of t he land remain on the planet, dying surely for the catastrophe . The mythology says that one night Ziusudra have had, in a dream, En.ki; the god explain to him what would happen and let to him the projects for a large vessel that would serve to save themsel ves with their families and numerous animals. Upon awakening Ziusudra found next to his bed of manuscripts that contained projects. These were plans for an ark, a vessel that can rescue people and animals to . In addition, after, he awarded an attendant to guide him in the navigation. Basically it was a son... So came the deluge, the Anun.na.ki watched the catastrophe through the portholes of their ships in orbit and regretted the loss of life not knowing that on the land there was an hope for mankind. Afte r the disaster, the water receded, and the guests, coming from Ni.bi.ru, are re - landed. En.ki went in search of Ziusudra, who had rescued his descendants, and many animals, and when he found led him to celebrate with him sparking the ire of his brother En. lil.

"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"58 Yehoshua Before starting this part I w ould like to make an introduction. In the last period were written several articles and books about the Holy Grail and have been several speculations on the ancestry of Jesus. In this chapter I would like to consider the figure of Christ only from the pers pective of the continuity of genetics that has passed through him. We have seen that throughout the history of the patriarchs there was divine intervention at key moments: the descendants of Adam and Ti.amat, the birth of Ziusudra, the choice of Abraham (w ho was descended from Sam, son of Noah) and finally the birth of Jesus Christ, who as we all know was created by the virgin Mary. If you notice, in the passages I have quoted is always at least one drop of divine blood. Let us continue, therefore, our history. Jesus Christ is born, Jesus comes from Joshua which means \"Yahweh is salvation\" and Christ from Kristos (greek), which is equivalent to masiah in Hebrew, which means Messiah. This god sets a fixed point in the history and will restore the hope on the land. The lineage of Christ that Mary Magdalene carried in her womb reached Jewish colony in Provence. From there the royal blood (Sang Real) became widespread over time, through the Merovingian dynasty to all major royal houses of Europe. Many peopl e will contest the words I just wrote \"... the lineage of Christ ...\" must bear in mind two key aspects of Jewish culture: a man could not have no wife and nobody could be called Rabbi (teacher) if he was not married. In addition, the Toledot Yeshu, the He brew biography of Christ, says at one point that Jesus and his sons went to Jerusalem on the day of rest of Passover, on Friday. Probably, as already advocated by several authors, the wedding at Cana described in the Gospel were the Jesus Christ's marriage with Mary Magdalene. Even the conception of Merovee, founder of the Merovingian mythology has something that looks like a divine intervention, his mother was kidnapped by a sea monster, the quinotauro, who kidnapped her and handed it back before his birt h. From here the dynasty went from Dagobert II to Sigisbert IV, his son. The Franks, barbarous people coming from the original site from north - central Europe, lived in the fifth century in France, ruled by King Merovee, legendary founder of the Merovingia n dynasty to which succeeded by Childeric and Clovis I (481 - 511) who have converted to Catholicism ."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"59 The power of the Frankish kings was eminently religious in nature while the government of the people was entrusted to the masters of the palace (the butle rs), this led them to resemble to the ancient priests. Hence the title of king slackers, these kings, priests king, known for their healing virtues, and the habit of wearing long hair, where resided their warrior strength as in the biblical tradition. It w as inevitable that the butlers took the place also directly to the authority as happened with Gromoaldo, a butler who managed to send in exile in Britain around 650 a. d. Dagobert II. Returning to France in 671, Dagobert married, apparently in the castle o f Renn es - le - Château, Giselle de Razès , a princess of Visigothic origin. To organize the war against the usurpers butlers Dagoberto accumulated enormous wealth that remain unused cause the killing of the king himself, took place in 679 at the hands of a but ler, Pepin of Herstal, in Stenay, in the Ardennes, where the king was buried and after his tomb went subsequently destroyed. With Dagobert ended the Merovingian bloodline so that followed the, so - called, Carolingian usurpation with the heirs of Pepin of H erstal. According to a legend, was still present the Merovingian succession in a son of Dagobert and Princess Visigoth, Sigisbert IV that had escaped the killers of her father's by hiding in his mother's lands at Rennes - le - Chateau, where he continued to ac cumulate money and gold to regain the usurped the kingdom. Sigisbert also failed to achieve his undertaking and his treasure still lies built up in the church of Rennes - le - Chateau, where, after some digging it was found by Abbot Berenger Sauniere called \"D alle des Chevaliers\" (slab of the Knights), below an altar. In the same church, according to Pierre Plantard de Saint Clair, currently alive, were found the manuscripts, he published, showing the existence of a secret society founded by Godfrey of Bouillon , from which the Priory of Sion was later born in 1119 's the order of the Knights Templar. Through this secret society would continue the Merovingian dynasty until the same Plantard, then heir to the hidden treasure of Sigisbert. So has arrived to the pres ent day the line of blood - knowledge handed down first from the Lord of the Earth and then by his priests. Templar s During the reign of Henry IV, Holy Roman Empire, the Crusades began, wanted by Pope Urban II. The Crusaders conquered the Holy Land in 109 9. After that event the Master Hugues de Payens, a group of eight men arrived in Jerusalem (Shu.Lim = the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"60 supreme place of the four regions). He organized the first original knights in response to the call of Pope Urban II. According to tradition these ear ly knights were nine. Fig 18 De Payens (Fig. 18) reached the King Baldwin II of Jerusalem with eight knights, two of them brothers and all relatives by blood or marriage, with the aim of forming the first Knights Templar. The other riders were Godfrey of Saint - Omer, Payen de Montdidier, Archambaud Agnan de Saint André de Montbard, Geoffrey Bison and two others reported only the names of Rossal and Gondemar. The name of the ninth knight remains unknown. St. Bernard of Clairvaux consecrated the Order, thu s becoming the founder in 1119, and wrote the rule, known De laude novae militiae, which already included poverty, chastity and obedience. This laid the foundations of what would also become an influential financial and military organization. Hugues De Pay ens led by Master of the Order of the Templars for almost twenty years until his death in 1136 in Palestine. These nine men began to dig under the Temple of Solomon for nine years in search of hidden treasure (perhaps the ancient knowledge). The Order of t he Knights Templar became powerful over time, so as to be able to organize a banking system and therefore be able to lend money even to the powerful families of Europe. It was this fact which made the Order unpleasant and unappealing. Thus did the French K ing Philip the Fair, who found himself, at some point in economic difficulties, and devised a stratagem to eliminate the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"61 Knights of the Temple and to seize their treasure. On 14 September 1307, the king sent sealed messages to all bailiffs , soldiers of th e Kingdom and seneschals ordering the arrest of the Templars and the confiscation of their goods, which were carried out Friday, October 13, 1307. The action has been cleverly launched simultaneously against all templar locations in France, the knights, su mmoned under the guise of tax assessments, were arrested. The charges that affected the Templars were defamatory: sodomy, heresy, idolatry. In particular were accused of worshiping a mysterious pagan god, the Baphomet (or Banfometto, that means Muhammad in the Occitan language, or as some say was the representation of the god En.ki). In the prisons of the King the arrested were tortured until they began to admit the heresy. Given its political power, Philip the Handsome, convinced Pope Clement V (Fig. 19) t o issue a papal bull ordering (November 22, 1307), in turn, the arrest of the Templars throughout Christendom. Fig 19 Clemente V e Filippo il Bello The plan hatched by the king of France, however, did not produce the desired effect, the Knights Templ ars in Europe, in fact, they stayed and let themselves be taken without resistance, as a cover for something bigger than themselves. In fact, with the escape by sea from France, a small group of Templars escaped to the King of France, the treasure came to Scotland (which did not applied the papal bull of dissolution of the Templars), more precisely, in Roslin, in the hands of the ancestors of William Sinclair, the descendants of the Merovingians and then of the Sang Real."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"62 No one knows exactly what happened to the treasure of the Templars between 1307 and 1446.

Initially the church was dedicated to St. Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist, because the September 21 corresponds to the Gregorian calendar day of St. Matthew. Besides the famous ceiling indecipherable, the chapel is also distinguished by a curious series of myths and legends that arose on it and around it, although it was built more than a century after the end of the Templars, it has several elements that richiamerebbero symbology associated with them (such as depictions of a horse with two riders).

Fig 21 According to some scholars, the Rosslyn Chapel is the place where it would be (or has been kept), the Holy Grail, that is said to be hidden in the column of the apprentice. Legend has it that a scholar who went into the Church had inspected all the column through a metal detector: arrived in the middle the column, the metal detector began to play; authorizations to carry out in - depth research, however, are not never been granted.

Fig 2 2 The proof of what I have mentioned can occur daily on the world's most popular currency, the dollar, the currency of the United States of America. As can be seen in the figure (fig. 22) there are two famous images that carry esoteric symbols, often used by the Freemasons. On the left is the Masonic pyramid with the words Annuit Coeptis = the deity has consented and under Nuovo Order Secolorum = new world order.

It was a book about esoteric symbolism. Were missing, now a few chapters at the end of the text.

Up to that point in reading that b ook I was thinking that it would never me changed the way of think and it would not give me inspiration to make one step more in my arduous climb. I was not realizing, however, that during the ascent of that pyramid, formed by small steps which not ending, I never looked up to see how far I had come. It was simply to change the way we see things. Sometimes we are not aware of how an object is made until we don't handle it. That night the same thing happened, the esoteric knowledge, I was studying, in its co mplexity symbolist took me to a simple truth. At a stroke riconsiderai all the symbolism of crop circles. For me it was an illumination, they were fifteen years I was looking for an idea assiduously to solve the mystery of crop circles and in the moment th at I had almost given up I was brought in on a silver platter idea that I had never considered. After seeing the technical side of \"field research\" and a historical summary, based on parts that I think are important to understand the continuation with th is chapter, I will now begin the interpretation of the phenomenon of crop circles.

We will see that the two chapters just discussed will become one with the next and that the soluti on will be as a whole. Passiamo ora all’oggetto del titolo di questo capitolo. Partiamo, quindi, dal “passachiave”: quell’anello che, di solito, viene schematizzato per rappresentare quella parte della Chiave che si tiene in mano e che si usa per trasmett ere la forza di rotazione che va ad agire sul meccanismo di apertura. Quando si parla del fenomeno dei cerchi nel grano la prima cosa a cui si pensa è al luogo dove vengono ritrovati di solito: l’Inghilterra. I crop circles sono diventati con gli anni un fenomeno mondiale, la statistica globale dice che in trentacinque anni lo stato più segnato è stato quello Inglese. Tratteremo meglio , però, questo argomento nel prossimo capitolo. Come dicevamo l’Inghilterra sembra, quindi, essere parte del messaggio. Il nome Inghilterra deriva dagli Angli , una delle numerose popolazioni di origine germanica che vi si insediarono nel V e VI secolo d.C , ed è spesso erroneamente usato per designare l'intero Regno Unito . Let us now to decipher the first part of the Key. In the following I wish to let understand where they come from their current names and symbols calling them by their old name Sumerian - Akkadian. Over the centuries and millennia the names have changed but their meaning is not changed while the knowledge of ancient history will lead us to better understand the symbolism.

Probably the technology available to them made them see it that way. As we saw in the previous chapter, when w e considered the Mitochondrial Theory of Eve, the races are spread throughout the earth . To the ancient people who created the British race ENGEL meant Lord The English land, as we know it now, took its name from this ancient root, thus becoming EN GELLA ND Engel from Lord and Land from the ground so we can translate as The L ord of the land Hence if, in Sumerian, En.ki meant \"the Lord of the Land \" this will become: KI.EN The land of the Lord  "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"69    "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"70 5 - The Supre me Center July 20, 1999, Devizes - Wiltshire. It was 9 pm, my wife and I returned back to the house of Mike and Coleen after spending the day in several fields of wheat. We already had assets of five crop circles and our curiosity was not so tired as we were. That night we began to mark the area on the map the places where we had found the crop circles and the ones that we had planned for the next day and every night, before returning, we passed by the Barge Inn to collect new reports. With the map before it was filling up with designs, we realized that the phenomenon we were studying was limited to a specific area and right before our eyes was forming a definite trend, that we checked out even better once back in Italy. All the roads we used up to that day revolved around a particular place: the Center. When I began to study systematically the phenomenon of crop circles one of the first things on which I researched it was the arrangement in the ground of the single figures. On one of the first books were written on the subject, I refer to \"Circular Evidence\" by Colin Andrews and Pat Delgado, he began to allude to a provision in a triangle that loomed over the county of Wiltshire. Some years later, in 1998, I met Colin Andrews at the World Congr ess of ufology of San Marino and talked with him of the arrangement of crop circles. At that time I've started reading some books by Zecharia Sitchin and therefore I theorized a circular disposition , sixty kilometers of radius around Stonehenge, as was t hat of cities Anun.na.ki in Babylon. He smiled interested in my idea. Obviously it was a hypothesis yet to be demonstrated in the ten years following the formations that rained down on"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"71 England spread far beyond the six \"beru\" (60 km in Sumerian) from Stone henge. My search for a code reading of the phenomenon did not stop and so I tried various roads. In two thousand, to coincide with the end of the old millennium, I decided to take all the figures that appeared, print them on a sheet of very long and hang t hem on a wall of the house so to see them all together. The result I had hoped did not arrive, that way, I realized however that the crop circles were not a continuous discourse as that which we could form with a words in a sentence. He was so that with h oly patience I began to collect data of the appearances of crop circles since 1978, the year in which the phenomenon showed itself systematically, until 2006. While I was doing the job I realized that most of the crop circles of a year appear in the Wiltsh ire county of England. So I parted the work into two parts: one analytical and one graphical. The analytical part was resolved with a chart divided into three main parts: the county of Wiltshire, England and the rest of the world (Fig. 1). Fig 1 The green towers of the graph represent the number of pictograms that appeared throughout the England and the county of Wiltshire is represented in yellow. In blue, however, are pictograms that appeared in the rest of mondo. As you can see at a glance the numb er of crop circles that appear in a year the Wiltshire is what it always has at least half of those appeared in England while the rest are divided in the rest of the world. So you can see that the county of Wiltshire is a bit the center of the whole phenom enon.

Of these, however, not all are genuine, many of them are artifacts. In the summer of 2001 Colin Andrews said that, according to his estimates, the percentage of crop circles \"real\" would be around around 20 percent. This would mean that, since the phenomenon began to appear regularly, are appeared about 3200 glyphs \"good\". It could do a lot of speculation about who made the 12800 crop circles remaining; responsibilities aside, the most popular theory is that which says that the \"man made\" are made to hide t hose \"genuine\", the aim would be to cover, with artifacts, the good crop circles in order to make believe \"man made\" even those who are not. By doing so, only the most knowledgeable people would realize the diversity and the mass would leave quietly losing the phenomenon considering it all a hoax to take too much care it. It goes without saying that this seems concocted by a \"top control\".

It starts with the color yellow to indicate a few drawings to switch to orange, the midway, to red, the high density. In the European zone (Fig. 3) the yellow spots are closer together, the states of this continent have been most affected by the phenomenon, but everyone in such a way slightly. England, however, is a different story. Infact we can really say that it is the first woman. The southern English island (Fig. 4) is interested by a zone of medium density all around the county of Wiltshire, which is a very narrow, where we have a third the number of crop circles from around the globe. Within this county, then, there is an \"hot\" point, for a radius of about 15 km around the site of Avebury - Silbury Hill (Fig. 5 and 6) we can define the \"heart\" of the phenomenon. In this zone, in fact, have appeared hundreds of crop circles, with figures also interesting and complex.

The most recent discoveries have shown (and all archaeologists agree on this) that the stone circle of Avebury was built in the Neolithic period, around 4500 BC and then at least 2000 years before Stonehenge. It is located in the center of the largest complex of boulevards and circles built with stones and seems, as a whole, a snake crossing the disk of the Sun. It consists of a mound, a huge circular pit (about a mile in circumference, about 9 feet deep), now only half as deep as the original, and a large ring of 98 stones which includes two smaller circles of 30 stones each and other stones arranged in various ways.

Was constructed in four different phases and has a truncated cone shape, with a slope in the steepest points of about 50%, corresponding to an inclinat ion of 30 °, a value that it has secured stability for about 4500 years. The four different phases of construction were driven together and followed each other at an age between 2725 ± 110 BC and 2145 ± 95 BC Exploiting as the initial base structure of a n atural outcrop of limestone, the work, at the end of the first two phases, reaches the dimensions of 17 meters in height and 110 meters in width at the base, for a volume of 28,325 cubic meters. The analysis on the types of insects buried in the oldest str ata of the building has been inferred that this was started between the second half of July and early August. The third phase of construction was the most important and significant: the Silbury Hill took the form of a cone with steps still partially observ able.

All those who had hitherto attributed to the crop circle hoaxers bei ngs would think again: the fact counterfeiters would had to make a circle every 30 - 60 seconds (the equivalent of 7 hours, at a minimum), without committing any errors or asymmetries. And all this in the pouring rain, in a field became a quagmire, without a trace and without splashing mud on the stems lying on the ground. In reality, everything must not have lasted more than five minutes! Finally, the press had to surrender to the conclusion that the pictogram could not have been human. In Italy only the pri nting of Turin had devoted a paragraph without adding too much information. The field in question, that night, had become a quagmire and it is also difficult to achieve: there passes no road and the nearest place where you can leave the machine is about a fifteen minute walk. In short, if you want to attribute the work to humans, there are many points to be clarified. Many scientific studies have been made on this mysterious figure, according to two researchers Ossebard Janet and Robert Boerman, there had been a strong development of heat, since the nodes of thousands of stalks were exploded, the grass had been lifted, twisted and finally dried before falling to the ground in a circular form (despite the rain), the rods were bent and twisted in a spiral, d irectly below the plants and in some cases also plants showing the curves, without that being broken or, the seeds, damaged . The words of the father of the researchers, Colin Andrews, a respect were: \"never seen pictograms better than this. This is the hi ghest point reached in the last 20 years ... \". After 10 years this figure is not yet been exceeded, perhaps it was the culmination to tell us something that does not give rise to any doubt. I'm thinking that the size of the pictogram have made that the p hotos, which are usually taken by motor gliders, microlights or helicopters, have been taken from a position so high that it forced us to rationalize this figure in the best way. Let me explain, sometimes, the crop circles are photographed from the hill si de and this distorts the figure at the expense of perfect understanding of symbol that is represented. Looking, then, the figure of Milk Hill in a geometrical sense we can bring it immediately to something simpler.

We have seen that most of the crop circles that appear in the world are located in a precise area that is located in northern England, in the county of Wiltshire, which has a huge histo rical and cultural significance from centuries if not millennia. We can calling this place, therefore, like the center. We later discovered that several pictograms that appeared around these places show, in different ways, a very ancient symbol, the \"Star of David.\" Over time this \"model\" has changed its significance for the peoples of the earth, especially in the second World War when it became a trademark. Has not changed its meaning, however, for those who hold the knowledge and knows the story all the w ay. For these people the \"seal of Solomon\" is always translated as the Center. As in a equation, one plus one makes two, also in this case are in the same place two objective realities, ancient, with the same cultural value. In practice we have a symbol t hat means the center on a place that was a sacred center of meeting. I interpret this as the reinforcement of a concept: the Centre into the center.

I found out later that it was the first conference on crop circles in Italy. At that time the phenomenon was not yet as well known as it was in England but the hall was full. The speaker began to show of images of places in the English countryside, a rchaeological sites and then made a long series of images of icons starting to describe the phenomenon. I was literally stunned by these drawings. As the conference went ahead my mind began to process the images and tried to find a solution to what the spe aker was describing as an incomprehensible mystery. These pictographs were, for me, something intangible that will thereafter, continued to torment me. That night I decided that I needed to find the solution to that mystery. July 20, 1999 - Hackpen Hill ( Wiltshire) It was late afternoon, my wife and I decided, that day, that we went around from east to west over the area of Marlborough to see two more crop circles. We had already seen the crop circle of Rockley Down and we were heading towards the hill of Hackpen to see the second. The road at some point went up and found ourselves, suddenly, to climb over a hill and take a downhill hairpin. In front of us opened wide the view on a field, I was forced to brake suddenly because we saw something that literal ly left us breathless. The pictogram of Hackpen Hill was something wonderful. It was a triple spiral inscribed in a thin and invisible circle with a diameter of 85 meters, her beauty was not so much in the lines of his drawings, but in its linearity and pe rfection. My wife was enchanted by its magnificence and both stayed to watch him for a while.

For several years, in fact, I sensed that the \"center\" of the issue must have been in Wiltshire, but I could not understand how to bind this land to the sequence of symbols that have rained down on this plac e for so long. I refer, of course, the only authentic part of the phenomenon of crop circles. It was just that \"carpet\" of symbols, which for years I have observed hoping to be able to reverse engineer, who suddenly had a meaning for me in all its totalit y.

The crop circ les are of complex figures, that can be interpreted in different ways. This is because each pictogram in reality, if it looks good, is a symbol or a set of symbols. A very significant example we saw in the previous chapter. To get the interpretation we wi ll consider now a series of crop circles. For each one we give a symbolic interpretation, and some definitions to explain its significance. At the end of the sequence we will see how to combine all the symbols. The first example that we see (Fig. 2) is a pictogram that if it is seen in negative look like a flower and if you look at it a little more detached might resemble a stylized representation of the sun . Fig 2 "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"93 F lower The flower is the reproductive organ of angiosperm, in which you develop gamet ophytes, fertilization occurs and develops the seed. The flower comes from the differentiation of the apex of a twig whose leaves have lost nearly always the photosynthetic capacity. This differentiation, such floral induction or induction antogena, occurs when the apex is still of microscopic size of the gem inside, under the stimulus of hormonal and environmental factors. The floral induction precedes the actual flowering, depending on the species, from a few weeks to about one year. Botany T he Sun The S un (Latin: Sol) is the parent star of the solar system, around which orbit the eight major planets (including Earth), dwarf planets, their satellites, innumerable other small bodies and dust diffused through space, that form the interplanetary medium. The Sun is only 99.8% by mass of the system. The Sun is, properly speaking, a star of small to medium consists essentially of hydrogen (about 74% of its mass, 92% of its volume) and helium (about 24 - 25% of the mass, 7% of the volume ), plus other heavy element s present in trace amounts. Solar radiation, emitted mainly as visible light and infrared, allows life on Earth by providing the energy needed to activate the main mechanisms that underlie it, also the insolation of the Earth regulates its climate and most of the weather . Placed inside the Orion arm, secondary arm galaxy, the Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way at an average distance of about 26000 light years, and completes its revolution in 225 million to 250 million years. If it were possible to obse rve our star from α Centauri, the nearest star system, it would appear in the constellation of Cassiopeia. Astronomy The second figure that we take into consideration (Fig. 3) may have different interpretations. It is a circle that inside which would seem represented the migration of the electrons that normally occurs between the anode and cathode in a magnetic field like that of the earth, the diamonds contained within it seems that represent the electric forces that are exchanged, in reality, between the two poles. The s ame figure can be seen also in another way. From the biological point of view could be a parthenogenesis cellular , and the two holes at the end of the two cuts, internal to the circle, seem to the beginning of the separation of a cell."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"94 Fig 3 Migration of electrons of a magnetic field The Earth's magnetic field that exists around the surface of our planet has a magnetic north pole and a south magnetic pole, which, however, should not be confused with the Earth's poles, because the line joining the magne tic poles do not coincide with the Earth's axis through the center of the Earth, but the latter is from about 1200 km, also between the Earth's axis and the magnetic axis exists an angle of about 11 °, called magnetic Declination. We should not consider th e magnetic poles as real geometric points, since they are located within areas of variable extension. It is affected by the earth's magnetic field also above the Earth's surface, in an area that is called Magnetosphere and which represents a kind of shield against cosmic radiation, in fact many ionized particles coming from the solar wind are captured by the Earth's magnetic field and end up concentrated in two areas: the Van Allen belts, which defend the Earth from solar radiation.

Throughout history many myths and legends have sprung up to explain the origin of the Milky Way from the milk of Hera suckling Hercule s in Greek mythology, the ethereal Ganges of India, imagined by Democritus and by Arab astronomers as a trail of distant stars, was later recognized as such by scholars and philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, William Herschel and Lord Rosse.

However, even in scientific publications the phrase Milky remains the most widespread, also to denote the galaxy as a whole. A stronomy The pictogram is called by all researchers The Julia Set (Fi g. 6) is the fifth example. The figure describes a perfect curve that represents the Fibonacci mathematical progression . Fibonacci progression The Fibonacci numbers are a mathematical sequence, whose elements and relations which are found in an extraordi nary variety of natural phenomena and artistic. To this sequence was given the name of its discoverer, of the thirteenth century, Leonardo Pisano known as Fibonacci. In a section of his famous treatise, Liber Abaci, these posed a mathematical problem: if a pair of rabbits remains isolated, how many rabbits will arise in the course of a year, assuming that each month a pair of rabbits produces another pair them, and that rabbits begin to give birth two months after his birth?. The entire sequence of Fibonacc i derives from the list of mature couples: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 etc..

Apparently all the crop circles, taken o ne by one, they contain more than one meaning or meanings that make them seem disconnected from each other. This has always deceived those who have tried to find the key to the problem. In the seven examples we have seen a flower (botany), Sun (astronomy), a magnetic field (Physics), cell division (Biology), a diagram of Mandelbrot (Mathematics), a galaxy (astronomy), the Fibonacci progression (Mathematics), a DNA (Biology), the lunar orbit (astronomy), a cosinusoide (Mathematics) and a winged sun disk (His tory). What is it that binds the sun with the Fibonacci progression, for example, or the Earth's magnetic field with a cell division or with Mandelbrot diagram? Apparently nothing. That 's what brakes people trying to find a common denominator, the one thi ng that would explain all the symbolism of the phenomenon.

Imagine seeing all from a higher orbit and not to see more of the symbols but the labels on which are writ ten, botany, astronomy, mathematics, biology, history, etc. .... What you will have will be nothing but an archive of topics. How could we call this archive? The answer is: the knowledge , that the Templars called gnosis . Now we will link to chapter three and in particular the part that I called Ib.ri, which speaks of the E. Kur. To resume the argument, the E. Kur (the house that is like a mountain) there was a room in which the priest established the contact with God. That place was called in Sumerian \"th e link between heaven and earth\" (Fig. 9). In practice, on the top step of the Ziggurat, the priest was talking with God and learned knowledge . This happened probably in all cultures, where the Druids were in contact with God and then handed down over time , the knowledge acquired in origin. This fact became over the centuries a thing \"confidential\" and took the name of esotericism, which comes from the greek esoterikos: all that is within or in, referring to the sacred mysteries. Knowledge , which was given to our fathers from the Anun.Na.Ki and that has been handed down to us, means that every person who possesses it will be raised up to understand who is Lord (En), which need not be understood as God Since the Lords - colonizers were seen descending from the sky, can lead us to say that to reach knowledge is like \"establishing a link between heaven and earth\", with those who created us."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"103 Fig 9 To relate the discussion to the phenomenon of crop circles, in practice, we see the whole phenomenon as a way to pus h us to become curious and seek knowledge .

The mystery is not solved yet but almost. It remains to make the last step, the most important, we have to make another effort in the abstract to move up another level. Now we will try to combine the three elements of our solution. The key says that the Link between Heaven and Earth (Knowledge) is located in the center of the Supreme Lord of the Earth (England). In practice we are faced with three main elements that will help us to have the overview. First, we note that there are three distinct parts. As with everything related to the esotericism even in this situation the number three does not happen at random. The number three and seven have always been, since the dawn of ti me, the magic numbers. Attentive readers will already have noticed that the chapter three and chapter seven of this book were not randomly assigned. In fact, the third chapter speaks of Knowledge and the seventh of the Key, as if to say: the Ancient Knowle dge and the interpretation. I didn't have ordered the chapters in this way to impress those who are reading this theory but I thought I would create all favorable conditions for training the brain to work for symbols. Someone maybe know that the numbers th ree and seven have been part of the oldest cultures from the beginning. We find these numbers from the cultures of"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"105 the Far East, India, the Middle East, the cradle of civilization, to ancient Egypt, classical Greece and ancient Rome. How is possible that t hese two numbers have became so important for so many people? To answer, now, I would like to make a parallel with another topic that resumed what already written in chapter three, in fact. I will speak now of astronomy. When a student attends school, duri ng lessons of history, he is told that the Sumerian people possessed considerable knowledge of astronomy. Think that this civilization was the one who gave the name to all the constellations and, as we saw earlier, knew the planet Ni.bi.ru (the planet of t he crossing) and knew that its orbit around our sun was of 3600 years. This is because the \"twelfth planet\", as he called by them, was the world of origin of their Lords (En). Their counted twelve planets in our solar system including the Sun, Moon and Ni. bi.ru. They were the first to adopt the sexagesimal system of measurement. They divided the day into 24 hours, the hours in 60 minutes. It goes without saying that the seconds that make up an hour are 3600! The most upsetting thing of the Sumerian people, however, was not that I just introduced but one that I'm going to describe. The Sumerian priests were aware of the fact that the planets Uranus and Neptune were twin planets because of their size and shape and that their color was green - blue! We had this information, with certainty, only after the launch of the Hubble telescope (the orbiting telescope) the 24 April 1990! How could, therefore, the Sumerian priests to have these astronomical information without having, apparently, the means to get them? To g et to the answer will introduce another element. The Sumerians knew that the earth was at position three (3) of the solar system by counting the planets from the sun and in the position seven (7) starting from outside the system. The three and seven, there fore, identify the exact location of our beloved land within its own membership system. What we have seen is the demonstration that certain information can only be arrived, to the sages of Sumer, which from an external source. Now let's put all in relation of to the \"Land of the Lord\" (the England). Even in this place the priests, called Druids, had several knowledge including that astronomical. The sacred landscape of Avebury, Silbury and Sanctuary (Fig. 1) which is located in Wiltshire in England shows a remarkable knowledge of the topography and the position of the stars. Then, as we saw in Chapter 5, were able to build a pyramid as Silbury Hill and placing huge stones to build the \"village\" of Avebury, showing a manufacturing technology not indifferent. The incredible thing is that the construction of these sites lasted centuries when the life expectancy of a man of that period was an average of thirty years. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"106 Fig 1 Upon completion of this talk I want to mention the legend that tells the origin of the name Silbury. It tells, in fact, of a mysterious knight named Sir Zel, by armor very bright and riding a horse with luminescent vestments, which reached impressive speeds. As time passed Zel has become, in slang, Sil and the hill took the name of Silbury H ill, \"the hill of the luminous Lord\". Notice how many strange things have happened in this place over the centuries. Starting from a huge project, which is carried on for centuries, which includes a circle of standing stones and the construction of a giant conic pyramid titled to a luminous lord; all connected with a shrine of the same size as Stonehenge. Think of it as a motivation must have driven the people of that time to do this. It must have been something really great or something that they considere d divine. We come now to the key to our mystery. We understand that Wiltshire is on a particular land, which has the name \"Lord of the Land\" and that on this territory there is a \"system\" of ancient archaeological sites that was used for rites of great i mportance. The ancient Druids were in contact with deities who passed them the Knowledge and they built a Center of cult that had its own internal"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"107 Fig 2 a E.kur (Fig. 2), a six - tiered ziggurat as those that were built in Mesopotamia, which they called Silbury Hill. We are faced, therefore, a center of knowledge that has been bombarded for three decades by hundreds of symbols , the crop circles. Our K ey , then, is a set of three elements that blend each other. The crop circles are arranged around a ver y ancient center as if to call attention to that place while it, with his own story, makes that people understand that the symbols of the pictograms have roots into our ancient history. It is, therefore, a very sophisticated way to attract the attention of those who approach the phenomenon, make them think and get them to do research until you come to discover \"The Link between Heaven and Earth\". "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"108 Conclusions Now we try to analyze what we found out placing us some questions. Why the phenomenon of crop circles has developed in the Wiltshire of England and in no other region on Earth? Perhaps this occurred as we have seen, first, for the historical value of England and his name (Engel - land - the land of the Lord). Secondly, there is, perhaps, a pract ical motive but highly symbolic: the cornfields. Knowing the area I can confirm that there is an immense area of wheat fields on which you can draw at will. The grain also has a considerable symbolic value, is also called the food of the gods, was donate d by the gods to Noah after the flood to start. This is also the only plant in nature that don't has the equivalent wild. If the phenomenon is meant to highlight the Centre, in Wiltshire, why he has developed in other areas of the world, albeit in a more modest mode? In my opinion the crop circles that appeared out of England are a wake up call for the place where the phenomenon has developed in more massive. Many times over the years, I've heard the phrase \"... I saw pictures of crop circles in Italy, Germany or Holla nd, but are not so beautiful and so frequent as those in England ...\" At this point, the crop circles fake create a huge trouble for the understanding of the phenomenon? When I started to study this phenomenon, I was very bothered by people trying to \"hoaxi ng\" the crop circles and then I happened to get into a pictogram which has been done by some guys in one night in May. Around this crop circle I saw several social phenomena: by the same authors who were selling commemorative T - shirts with pictures of the field, people who had done it hundreds of miles to see an exceptional event by up to those who thought to have a benefit from crop circles, inside, in meditation. After this event, I realized, and I am convinced, developing this theory, that crop circles ar tifacts have a part in the game. In my opinion, their purpose is, however, double and that is to keep alive the attention to the originals without alarming people. The problem of the public order has always been very important, if to the mass is proposed a n objective reality that can to become , potentially, a threat is likely to create disorder. Otherwise If you make people aware of a fact which, however, that could be"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"109 replicated by anyone in the minds of people, there will always hope that all is well. Du ring the writing of my theory I had some difficulty because of the hoax crop circles but the experience and the information helped me to understand that this kind of icons do not have, often, no symbolic meaning, or are copies of other already appeared. In practice it was the ticket to pay to be able to understand the meaning of those real. A question that made me a few times is this \"... so are the Anun.na.ki to make crop circles?\". We do not know but it is not automatic that they are. The Druids Celtic w ere in contact, in turn, with gods they had similar names but not necessarily had to be them. In my opinion the symbols that have led the Anun.na.ki can be used by another form of intelligence to lead, however, the man to make a step upward. Who already kno w the secret of crop circles? This question has already been made to me during my lectures and I would present it again I think there are \"cliques\" as Freemasonry or other groups of higher power that have come to the solution of the problem for some time and that with the crop circles have received a \"signal\" to the beginning of something. Think that Freemasonry, for example, was officially founded in England, a place, we have seen, of some importance for crop circles. So we might think that Freemasonry wa s already aware of this, in the sense that, as a coterie of esoterics, he knew that if once the Land of the Lords was the area of Lebanon later, maybe, it had become England. Given that my theory is correct, the Masons have been found painted on the whea t fields of Wiltshire that ancient knowledge that the Templar Order in Rosslyn left and must have realized that all that until now have guarded with great care, maybe will be unveiled shortly to all humanity. In any case we could say that crop circles are a direct message to those who had the knowledge to understand and who was stimulated to decipher. We can therefore conclude that the phenomenon of crop circles is a very fine try to evolve the man in order to prepare it for something very important that wi ll happen. Or maybe to help in reaching a natural evolution that is approaching.

It seemed the perfect passing of the baton from us to her who had the task of cleaning the bl ackboard of a week of lessons.
