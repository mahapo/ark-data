These formations in our fields are the most enigmaticmystery of our day, and yet millions, who have never visited one, write them offwith spoon-fed explanations. I have followed the phenomenon since the lateeighties, visiting well over a dozen firsthand, once as the first visitor. Noone has ever convinced me they were all created by the human hand. Lucy’sexploration of the energy within the formations and its effect on our bodies isa particularly fascinating aspect of these beautiful messages in our fields.This is a book that will take you down many new and unexpected paths. Acombination of compelling science and stories of extraordinary events recordedover a period of thirty years, this book lifts the crop circle phenomenon topreviously unexplored levels of investigation, enhanced by Lucy’s wonderfulphotography. A must-read for all travelers of the known and unknown.”SIR MARK RYLANCE, ACTOR, THEATER DIRECTOR, AND PLAYWRIGHT“This book is a must for everyone interested in crop circles. It is wellresearched and proposes some fascinating new ideas that are sure to grab theattention of both the scientific and paranormal research communities. Crammedwith captivating information, it makes compulsive reading.”GRAHAM PHILLIPS, AUTHOR OF WISDOMKEEPERS OF STONEHENGE“For decades, crop circles have attracted the attention of scholars,photographers, hoaxers, and pranksters, making it difficult to understand thesubject. Separating the wheat from the chaff can be difficult in such a mixedclimate! Lucy Pringle and James Lyons separate fact from fiction, bringing arefreshing scientific approach to the hidden energies and dynamics of cropcircles. The nature of consciousness, the ancient art of dowsing, and EarthEnergies are explored in detail. The authors’ research offers fascinatinginsights into the mesmerizing annual appearance of crop circles. The stunningphotography drew me ever closer to the circles, and it felt like I was there.Enjoy this book, as it is a beacon of light that will illuminate yourunderstanding of crop circles.”MARIA WHEATLEY, AUTHOR OF DIVINING ANCIENT SITES AND PROFESSIONAL DOWSER“For three decades, Lucy Pringle has been one of the most intrepid andpersistent researchers of the mysterious crop circle phenomenon. In the face ofoften relentless skepticism or indifference from the mainstream, Lucy’spassionate determination to focus on actual data, meticulously gathered frompersonal studies and the crucial testimony of many people, has enabled her tocompile this very valuable book. Whatever anyone’s opinions of where cropcircles come from, the reality is that they have had a profound effect, bothmentally and physically, on those who have visited them. The Energies of CropCircles brilliantly records many of these experiences for future generations,who may one day, with advancing scientific discoveries, find a new context inwhich to place this intriguing evidence, which we dismiss at our peril.”ANDY THOMAS, MYSTERIES RESEARCHER AND AUTHOR OF THE TRUTH AGENDA WEBSITE“The combination of Lucy Pringle’s elegant photographs and James Lyons’s lucidexplanations elevates The Energies of Crop Circles to a new understanding sincethe modern appearance of this ongoing fascinating and mysterious phenomenon.This is a book of value for everyone who seeks knowledge of our world.”MARCUS ALLEN, UK PUBLISHER OF NEXUS MAGAZINE“Crop circles are fascinating, and this book allows us to explore the depth ofour Universe and to receive new perceptions and knowledge, which is useful inthis era of big changes.”LILOU MACÉ, AUTHOR OF THE YONI EGG AND HOST OF LILOU MACÉ TV“The mysterious and often elaborate crop circles that have adorned the fields insouthern England over the past 30 years have inspired the authors to make anin-depth study of people’s experiences when visiting them. Lucy documents thesefascinating accounts and, with the aid of scientist and dowser James Lyons,shows that the underlying science has a universal origin and intelligence. Theselected circles are illustrated by Lucy’s superb aerial photographs; relevantaspects of the science are detailed in the appendices.”ANDREW KING, PH.D., BIOLOGIST“Not only is this a fascinating and entertaining book, but it is trulymind-expanding. The materialist paradigm, which permeates the science of today,finds us lacking in the conceptual equipment required to cope with the cropcircle phenomenon. The accounts of people’s experiences, reactions by animals,strange and meaningful synchronicities, and not least so many inexplicable factson the ground, baffle the way of thinking that most of us have grown up with.It’s no wonder why crop circles aren’t featured in the mainstream mediamuch—those writing about them don’t know what to say!James Lyons’s comments are of great value. As he points out, earliercivilizations, and even tribal people today, have a conceptual map which caninclude such phenomena. His interpretation of crop circle geometry in relationto music is of special value.This book should be widely read, especially by scientists.”ROGER TAYLOR, PH.D., B.V.SC., IMMUNOLOGIST"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSOVER THE PAST ALMOST THIRTY YEARS I have had the pleasure and privilege ofmeeting and chatting with hundreds of people both inside and outside the cropcircles, in person, or by email and letter. I have been inspired by theirstories and sometimes even moved to tears by their experiences and how the cropcircles have impacted and changed their lives in often unexpected and wonderfulways. There can be no doubting the veracity of their experiences as they havefrequently happened so unexpectedly that people have been totally taken aback bywhat has taken place and still can hardly believe how their thinking and beinghave been changed completely and opened up as a result. New realms ofunderstanding have entered their lives, giving them changed and broadenedperspectives. Some of the reports I have received are confidential and willalways remain so, but others have gladly shared their stories, and I would liketo thank all those who have played an essential part in this book—each oneimparting his or her own precious pearl of wisdom.Writing this book has reminded me of many of my own experiences, which, likeothers, have happened literally out of the blue, some good, some bad. These havegiven me insights into previously unexplored regions of my being and myunderstanding of our world, my fellow beings, and our planet and often otherunseen worlds. They have all been part of my journey, a journey of explorationand further learning.Even though writing has always been an essential part of my being ever since Ican first remember, it essentially is a lonely yet fascinating experiencerequiring much exhilarating research but also strict discipline. As a result itmay seem to be a selfish occupation, and so I would like to thank my manyfriends and family, whom I may have neglected, for their patience andunderstanding.However, my most grateful and enormous thanks and gratitude must be reserved forPatricia Daubney, without whose encouragement this book would never havehappened. I had started writing it and it was largely finished—at which pointthe wastepaper basket seemed the most fitting place for it. Patricia thoughtotherwise and persuaded me to continue. Reluctantly I consented and asked JamesLyons, my longtime friend and colleague, if he would contribute his wisdom. Hegladly agreed and so the fate of the book was sealed. Patricia has never failedto give unstintingly of her time and encouragement throughout, with endlesspatience and wonderful good humor in helping pull the book into shape. She hasplayed a major role. James Lyons is in full agreement with this and adds hismost grateful thanks to Patricia for all her invaluable help.LUCY PRINGLE"},{"pageContent":"CONTENTS 1. Cover Image [9781620558683_cvi.xhtml] 2.

If they areparanormal then they are surely the most significant psychic events occurringtoday. If they are of alien origin then only fools would not pay them seriousattention. If they are man-made, then they are probably the best-known modernart in the world, as people recognize them from Moscow to Tokyo—beat that,Damien Hirst!I spent four or five very happy summers crop circling (yes it’s a verb) in theearly 1990s. As database manager for the Centre for Crop Circle Studies I had amobile phone the size of a large brick and drove around visiting crop formationscollecting information, making surveys, and meeting people. And what wonderfulpeople I met. In the middle of the night in one formation I met an Alaskanscientist who was convinced that crop circles were the past imprints of futurepower stations. In another I met a writer who was sure that they were messagesfrom the collective subconscious executed by fairies. In another I met a psychicwho regularly communicated with alien spacecraft, and who could summon balls oflight. I spent nights manning infra-red microwave plasma scanning equipment fora team from the University of Tokyo. One fine morning I met a couple who hadjust seen an enormous flying saucer covered with lights, which had created acrop circle, before flying off. I spoke to five other people who had seen itbefore a man from the Ministry of Defense confiscated my report. It was likebeing in the middle of the X-files. And, right in the middle of all theintrigue, I met Lucy Pringle, and later, Jim Lyons.I was immediately fascinated by what Lucy was doing. Like her and Jim, I wastalking to a lot of people, and kept hearing the same stories. By far the mostcommon subject of conversation, aside from who or what was making crop circles,was the extraordinary effect they seemed to have on people visiting them.Cameras jammed. Batteries suddenly ran down. Strange buzzing noises wererecorded. People returned to their cars and found they wouldn’t start. Or theybumped into close friends they hadn’t seen for years or just random people fromthe same distant village or with the same professions or names. Crop circlesseemed connected to some higher reality. Some people started having visions,seeing auras, or experienced extraordinary healing. People felt elated. Peoplefelt puzzled. People felt peculiar.Some people felt happy-peculiar, I certainly did. Going into a fresh crop circleat dawn made my fingers tingle and the hair on the back of my neck stand up.With a group of friends we would slowly crawl inch by inch over the dew-coatedswirled wheat, lifting it up and looking for footprints, crushed clods of earthbeneath, or any other evidence of humans in there before us, and find none.Other people, however, would visit a crop formation and immediately feeluncomfortable, discombobulated, and then develop a headache, either immediatelyor half an hour after leaving. Many people felt intensely sleepy soon aftervisits to crop circles. They would have to pull over and snooze and oftenreported life-changing dreams.Lucy’s work, collected in this excellent book and illustrated with her masterfulphotographs, demonstrates the extraordinary range of psychological andphysiological responses people have had to crop circles. Running alongside thisexposition, Jim Lyons’s meticulous scientific research provides some fascinatingand thought-provoking explanations of what really might be going on.Crop circles are ephemeral—here today, gone tomorrow. All that remains of themafter they are harvested each year are the photographs and stories told bypeople who visited them. This book is the first detailed collection of suchstories, and it represents an important milestone in crop circle research. Thephotographic record may tell us a certain amount about this extraordinaryphenomenon, but these stories, carefully collected over the past thirty years,and many reproduced here for the first time, tell us much more. I can’tpersonally vouch for every story in this book, but I can vouch for hundreds ofother similar ones I heard myself from complete strangers. What this bookreveals is a far more nuanced, complex, and intelligent phenomenon than manywill have suspected.An old Chinese proverb says: Mind, like parachute, works best when open.

It all happenedwhen my two children left the nest and suddenly there was a terrible bottomlessvoid in my life, known as the empty nest syndrome. After years of bringing upthe boys I found I had time for myself, and I could either sink or swim. Whatwas I going to do with this new syndrome of wondering how was I going to fill mydays, and what was I going to do with my time?At that time I had just recently moved to Hampshire, and I suddenly found myselfin the place where the early crop circles first appeared right on my verydoorstep. This started a new and unexpected chapter in my life, one in which Ihave been increasingly involved for over a quarter of a century.When I was asked to write a book about healing in crop circles, I never realizedwhat an exciting and challenging journey I was about to take. I was a foundingmember of the first academic society to study the circles, the Centre for CropCircle Studies, set up at Easter 1990, so I have been there from the beginning.I have seen our understanding of the circles progress beyond all recognition asthe technology and methodology for studying them have improved and evolved.As so often happens, despite remaining a group for many years, we allindividually seemed to find our own particular lines of research. I fell intomine purely by chance one gloriously sunny day in July 1990, three months afterthe society was set up.A GOOD PLACEI would like to tell you about what happened in a crop circle in the Winchesterarea on that day in July 1990. I had my sister, Amanda Spence, and a closemutual friend, Maggie Randall, with me. The latter had the great misfortune tosuffer from Raynaud’s phenomenon, a condition affecting blood circulation. Wewent into the crop circle, and I proceeded in my usual way recording the YIN andYANG energies (YIN and YANG represent the Female and Male energies,respectively, and can be detected by dowsing) and noting the strength of thedifferent energy forces, as well as the manner and direction in which the croplay. Having almost completed this, I sat down on a strong energy point on theperimeter of the YANG circle with great relief as I had hurt my right shoulderplaying a ferocious set of mixed tennis doubles the previous evening. I had beenunable to use my right hand to brush my teeth that evening, as the pain inraising my arm was considerable.As I was sitting, relaxing in the circle, I became aware of energy ripplingthrough my shoulders. I gently moved my right shoulder and found to my amazementthat I could move it without pain. I stayed where I was and let the energycontinue to flow until my shoulder was completely mobile and free of pain.Having been full of doom and gloom at the prospect of being out of tennis forthe rest of the season, I was joyful at my recovery.What happened to my friend was no less dramatic; on becoming aware of what washappening to me, I called to her and suggested she should come and sit close byme. I did not tell her what had happened to me; I simply suggested she mightfind it a “good place” to sit. She immediately expressed a feeling of tremendouswell-being and said her fingers were tingling. She later described it this way:“I can’t explain the tingling I experienced in my fingertips except to say itwas as if my fingers had been cold, as in a Raynaud’s spasm, and that they werewarming up, that is, the blood was beginning to flow properly again. But myfingers had not been cold—quite the opposite when one remembers that that Sundaywas probably one of the hottest days of the summer!” I still had a few things Iwanted to check in the configuration so I left her there, and when I returnedfound her lying happily on her side with a blissful smile on her face. This shecannot normally do, for as she says,It is rare that Raynaud’s phenomenon (or syndrome) is an “illness” by itself.Usually there is an underlying cause, and in my case it is scleroderma.Scleroderma, in turn, can be of two types—either morphea, which is localized, orsystemic sclerosis (which is what I have)—and can affect different organs. Oneof the commonest organs to be affected is the esophagus; the sphincter muscle tothe stomach becomes slack and consequently allows the stomach acids to flow up,thus causing ulcers which, when healed, form strictures and thereby narrow thepipe. This is why I have trained myself to lie propped up; otherwise it is likehaving perpetual heartburn! And I didn’t get “heartburn” when lying flat in thecrop circle!She was most reluctant to leave the circle after lying on her side for at leasttwenty minutes. Sadly she is now deceased as a result of a different condition,but I remained in touch with her regularly after that day, and she becameaccustomed to her newfound sense of well-being. She was sleeping extremely welland her energy increased noticeably, and, in general, there was a continuedmarked improvement in her condition.After my own personal healing experience in 1990, I realized that there must bemany other people experiencing similar effects, and, in order to try and explorewhat was happening, I drew up a rudimentary questionnaire to find out more. Iwas amazed by the huge response.This extraordinary event was the trigger point and catalyst for my years ofresearch into what has now become increasingly sophisticated and scientificwork. This work has involved many wonderful people who have contributedunstintingly to my somewhat seemingly “way out” ideas that have, nevertheless,produced significant results and taken me further down the path ofinvestigation. To my amazement I was once told that, as I was describing anidea, I had in fact unwittingly described a certain complex theorem. I have tothank the genes from my father’s side, as members of his family were allbrilliant scientists, whereas I had no scientific training and have now come inat post-grad level without any training but with strong gut feelings!James Lyons, my coauthor and a polymath in his own right, has been one of thoseleading lights who unreservedly have given me their time and encouragement, ashe too came to understand the results we were finding in the crop circles wereall part of a far greater compass of learning and discovery. Lyons is achartered engineer specializing in aeronautical and electrical engineering. Hehad a long and successful career in the aerospace industry and academia. Hisenthusiasm is catching, and to work with him is a delight.This book will lead you along our paths of adventure as we seek to shed morelight on this brain-rattling and wonderful subject. When approaching thissubject, it may be best to fasten your seat belts!"},{"pageContent":"PROLOGUE 2THE CREATION OF CROP CIRCLESimage [images/9781620558683_001.jpg]by James LyonsWHEN WE LOOK AT the formation of crop circles we need to start with our SolarSystem. The Sun is the key energy source, which is electrically charged like thepositive terminal of a battery. It emits particles incessantly, and thisemission is called the “solar wind.”At the moment the Sun has on its surface black-looking features from whichspiraling tubes of energy are emitted. These are so-called torsion waves becauseof their essentially twisting nature. These waves strike the magnetosphere,which surrounds the Earth and is a layer of charged particles supported there bythe Earth’s magnetic field. This layer occasionally breaks down and lets throughthese Sun waves.The waves mainly enter the Earth via the poles, which give rise to the auroraborealis at the North Pole and the aurora australis at the South Pole. When thewaves break through at other points around the Earth they give rise to veryhigh-altitude plasma effects known as “sprites.” All of this is the source ofthe electric charge we find around the Earth. The Earth is negatively chargedand acts like the other terminal of a battery.The charge within the Earth is arranged into patterns like cymatic patterns ofsand on a vibrating drum surface. The key structures are north-south, east-westgrid patterns, which we detect as ley lines, to use the older terminology.These are the “graph paper” on which crop circles are created. The formationsconsist of mostly six rings and eight radial patterns. The geometry is governedby the diatonic scale, but we need not go further at this juncture on this veryimportant topic. These nodal points of the rings and the radial lines are foundin all ancient sites around the world and in churches built before theReformation. These web patterns are the result of combinations of the telluriccurrents and the water streams beneath the ground. The water is, of course,electrically charged.We need now to consider cloud formations, which are also made of water droplets,all charged, that cluster together. If the weather pressure pattern is of acertain kind, then the clouds’ electric positive charge engages with thenegative charge of the Earth below. This forms an enormously strong electricfield, which, not surprisingly, creates a discharge to ground.It strikes at the point of lowest resistance, which is the center of the Earth’s“acupuncture point,” or, more precisely, the water-stream crossover point. Thewater breaks down into gaseous form, hydrogen and oxygen. Like a smoker blowinga smoke ring or a dolphin blowing a ring, the toroidal ring formed, being nowless dense than its surroundings, rises like a bubble in a bottle. It breaksthrough the ground into the crop from below and, because it is at a lowerpressure than the ambient air pressure, there is an enormous sucking downprocess, which is responsible for flattening the crop.The wave-type nature of the toroidal ring possesses spirals on its surface,which are responsible for flattening the crop in very characteristic ways. Theinitial lightning strike has already broken down the local air into nitrogen andoxygen, which interpenetrates with the crop and recombines to enhance thenitrate level.This is a simple description for the creation of crop circles.However the dramatic changes in mainstream science are again revealing theconcept of Cosmic Consciousness. Crop circle investigators are confirming thatthe human mind operates synonymously with the Crop Circle Consciousness. This isour link to the crop circle phenomenon."},{"pageContent":"1SANCTITY WITHIN THE CIRCLESIf the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as itis, infinite.WILLIAM BLAKE (1757–1827)OCCASIONALLY, PERMANENT HEALING can occur as a result of visiting crop circles,but the majority of reports fall into the negative list of effects: visitors tocrop circles automatically expect to feel well and therefore are surprised anddismayed when the opposite occurs (and as a result will submit a negativereport, whereas a beneficial experience unless strikingly unusual will beaccepted as being normal).However, while the greater number of healing events are unfortunately onlytemporary in nature, they are still worth discussing in order to illustrate theeffects of the inherent residual “energies” and their subsequent impact onliving systems, even from a distance.Arthritis and rheumatism sufferers seem to gain noticeable but temporary relief.Longtime sufferer Leslie Clementson is one of my most generous reporters:After doing a night watch on Knapp Hill, near Alton Barnes, we drove as far aswe could and then walked the rest of the way, and as before I was in a lot ofpain when we reached it. We were meeting friends who had walked up; we wanderedaround it for a while then stopped in the center for about fifteen minutes.Unlike the Lockeridge, near Marlborough, formation (1992) when the swelling inmy feet was so drastically reduced that my shoes kept falling off, I was unawareof anything happening until we started to walk back to the car only to discoverthat I could almost keep up with Steve. I haven’t been able to do that sinceLockeridge. It’s a shame it did not help Steve, who has a broken toe!I received a further report from Leslie dated September 7, 2001, saying,I thought I would let you know that the healing I received in the Milk Hillformation, near Devizes, is just starting to subside. It lasted longer than theLockeridge one. I now look forward to the next.And she sent a further report from a different visit to the same formation someyears later:I had been having problems with very painful and swollen feet for about ten daysand had difficulty getting to the formation, even though it was a relativelyshort distance from my car. When I was inside the formation, I felt no pain atall and could walk without difficulty. Once I was a few yards down the tramlineagain the discomfort returned.Was this due to the uneven ground? But when she visited the East Field formationon July 12, 2007,with some difficulty walking and with additional pain in one shoulder, onceinside the formation, both feet and shoulder became pain free, and discomfortthen returned soon after leaving the formation. Obviously the shoulder pain wasnot related to the soft surface, so it seems that it was being in the formationthat gave relief. I have visited other formations this year, but no others haveaffected pain levels.Diana Cussons, a dear friend of over eighty years old, suffering from severeosteoporosis, had long beseeched me to take her into a formation to experiencethe “energies.” Her stipulations were it had to be one that was new, one thatwas close to where she lived, and one that was fairly near to the road so thatshe would not have too far to walk. It just happened that one appeared nearby atTeglease Down, East Meon, Hampshire, on June 30, 1997, a circle within easyreach of the car, which meant she would not have too far to walk before reachingthe circle.image [images/9781620558683_002.jpg]Fig. 1.1. Pastry Cutter, Teglease Down, East Meon, Hampshire, June 30, 1997.I had found a formation that seemed to fit the bill. “Was 6:00 a.m. too early?”“Not a bit, how about 5:00 a.m.?” she replied. We settled on 6:00 a.m. It was anovercast, heavily clouded but sultry morning as we made our way into the fieldand walked toward the formation following the tramline, the lines used byfarmers in order to facilitate crop sowing and spraying, Diana coming at her ownpace using her walking stick. What was a short walk for me was quite anotherthing for her. At this time of day there is a certain indescribable magic about.The birds and animals treat you as one of them, there is no fear, for we are allpart of the same ecological system, all interdependent and interactive.The ground was wet, covered in heavy overnight dew, so sitting down in thecircle was out of the question. Time speeds up in genuine formations, and onehour can seem like thirty minutes. We didn’t talk a lot, there seemed to be anoverwhelming sense of awe as though in a cathedral, and silence was appropriate.The quietness of mind and spirit one experiences is memorable; there is a senseof total security, and in that silence and safety one allows oneself totranscend to higher levels of consciousness.I dropped Diana home by 8:00 a.m. Two hours later she telephoned in greatexcitement: she was totally free of pain. Normally after such strenuous exerciseshe would have been flat on her back in bed, suffering immense pain. Over amonth later she was still free of pain.WONDERFUL BUT TEMPORARYAnother old friend, Christina Thistlethwayte, reluctantly came with me to a cropcircle at King’s Somborne, Hampshire, in 2011. Her reluctance was due to thefact that she had an agonizingly painful back and polymyalgia rheumatica (amuscular condition of unknown cause that can be so painful that people sometimesfind themselves unable to get out of bed in the morning). However, she managedto hobble into the formation.There were several others in the circle and we chatted, and I walked aroundexamining the lay of the crop. (It had formed on a rainy night but photographstaken early the following morning showed no trace of mud on the fallen crop,which would have been present if people walking round with boards had flattenedthe crop.)Suddenly the sky appeared threatening, and we walked back to the car. As we weregetting in, Christina announced, “All the pain in my back has gone!” Wonderful,but so often it is only temporary, and I told her that it might not last.image [images/9781620558683_003.jpg]Fig. 1.2. King’s Somborne, Hampshire, June 18, 2011.image [images/9781620558683_004.jpg]Fig. 1.3. King’s Somborne, Hampshire, within the larger landscape, June 18,2011.image [images/9781620558683_005.jpg]Fig. 1.4. A ground-level view at King’s Somborne, Hampshire, June 18, 2011.As I dropped her home, to my astonishment she stood on one leg and brought herknee up to her chin and then repeated it with the other leg! Amazed, I tried itmyself on returning home. Fine if you are fit, but not easy if you are in anypain. She had no pain for four days. What a blessed respite!A BEDTIME BLESSINGYet another report from a now-deceased elderly lady, Dorothy Colles, whosuffered from both arthritis and macular degeneration (an eye condition wherebysight becomes increasingly limited). She was possessed of a penetratingly clearmind, and during the Second World War worked in photographic intelligence in theMiddle East.We entered the 1999 Warnford, Hampshire, formation on a sunny day in July.Dorothy and I walked slowly round the formation, examining the general layoutbut, as so often happens, the desire to sit quietly and meditate wasoverwhelming.image [images/9781620558683_006.jpg]Fig. 1 5. Warnford Knot, Warnford, Hampshire, July 20, 1999.Dorothy immediately knew exactly where she wanted to sit. “You will have to pullme up later,” she announced.I went to an area close by and sank into a deep meditation. After what seemedlike a short time (but was in fact thirty minutes) Dorothy’s head suddenlyappeared over the top of the standing crop. No help had been needed—there shewas, standing upright, having shot up like a cork out of a champagne bottle!Dorothy recounts her visit thus:This was the first formation I had ever been in . . . first impression was of anaffectionate amused sense of “welcome” from the image to me. I was struck withwonder. There was a feeling of Presence—wholly benign. When I lay down on thelaid corn there was an uprush of security and assurance that was amazing, and asI stroked the horizontal layering it felt as responsive as a family animal, apony, a Labrador, or whatever—it was familiar not strange.I got up without the usual arthritic creaks and effort without even noticing andleft the beautiful quadruple rings with regret. I would have liked to stay allday there with them and that all-encompassing friendliness. There was no senseof time.I am eighty-two and have collected several impediments along the way, but noneof this seemed relevant while we were there. Afterward the energy bubbled up ineveryday life. When I go to bed I deliberately relive the moment of walking inand lying down and that initial delight before I sleep—it’s a bedtime blessing.A FORM OF REJUVENATION?Another delightful account came from an intrepid participant in one of my cropcircle tours. Nearly eighty, Doreen Binks was originally concerned that shewould not have the energy or stamina to last the day of vigorous walking, mostdemanding of which was the mile-plus trek in the afternoon (having alreadyvisited two formations in the morning) up to the 1999 Ogbourne Maisie“Trilobite,” near Marlborough, Wiltshire, walking zigzag along the bottom of thefield and then up a long uphill and twisty side tramline in order to reach theformation.However, her glowing report tells me,I felt tired as we reached the Ogbourne Maisie crop circle and sat down in thecircle for about ten minutes—on leaving the site, I was surprised to find thatmy fatigue had gone. As we reached Stonehenge I was anticipating feeling tired,having been on the go all day. I leaned against the stones and felt only a smalltingle in one hand, but on leaving the site, I found I was no longer tired onarriving home at 10:00 p.m.! I was feeling refreshed and not hungry. I had thebest night’s sleep in months, and the following day woke up feeling very calmand positive, which lasted all day. I was apprehensive about how I would copewith a fourteen-hour day; so the outcome was a big surprise—somethinghappened—what? Can one tap into this form of rejuvenation?One woman who had recently had a hip operation found that by simply looking at aformation from nearby, she was able to walk a distance that the previous day hadbeen quite beyond her capability and was beyond the laws of probability. Manypeople have remarked on a new outer clarity of vision as though the scenery ismade up of sharply defined “cutouts.” A new inner clearness of vision is alsooften reported.image [images/9781620558683_007.jpg]Fig. 1.6. Ogbourne Maisie, within larger landscape, Wiltshire, July 29, 2009.HOT FEETDan Voice, a landscape gardener, had been suffering from a groin strain for fiveto six days prior to our expedition and was in some pain. As we were walking inthe tramline toward the formation, he suddenly stopped and called out to me. Helooked ecstatic and said he had never ever experienced such a feeling ofhappiness and peace, almost beyond words. “At the same time the soles of my feetbegan to warm. The discomfort in my groin disappeared. The warming of my feetbecame intense but not painful.”image [images/9781620558683_008.jpg]Fig. 1.7. Ogbourne Maisie, Wiltshire, July 29, 2009.Another report of “hot feet” was sent to me by someone visiting the BarburyCastle “Flower” in Wroughton. She experienced “warmth on the bottom of my feet,heaviness lying down, increased sense of smell and general awareness.” On bothoccasions the weather was cool and cloudy.What possible explanation could there be? We know that subtle energies and eddycurrents in the brain kick-start the hypothalamus. Two of the effects areincreased thirst and sense of smell. Also, in Dan’s case, the nerves runningdown his leg were stimulated. This often occurs to people who have suffered somesort of spinal trauma, are diabetic, or have arthritis.The hypothalamus is a very important part of the forebrain, which lies below thethalamus, and forms the lower part of the ventricle and its floor. Its integrityis essential to life, for it is concerned with the “vegetative” functions. Itplays a major part in regulating the temperature of the body, body weight andappetite, sexual behavior and rhythms, blood pressure and fluid balance, and caneven be said to be the physical basis of the emotions.We need to examine the possible reason for these encouraging reactions. We donot know enough about the “cause” of rheumatism or arthritis, but we do know theeffect is inflammation. Could the residual effects of the electromagnetic fieldspresent in some formations be acting as an anti-inflammatory? We are told thatthere are over a hundred types of arthritis, including osteoarthritis and gout.The word arthritis means “joint inflammation.” Inflammation is one of the body’snatural reactions to disease or injury and includes swelling, pain, andstiffness. Inflammation that lasts for a very long time or recurs, as inarthritis, can lead to tissue damage.Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. With this condition, somethingseems to trigger the immune system to attack the joints and sometimes otherorgans of the body. The exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, but itis thought to be due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonalfactors. Other theories suggest that a virus or bacteria may alter the immunesystem, causing it to attack the joints.NO BUMP!Some reports, however, seem to go beyond medical and scientific explanation andtake us into areas as yet little understood or explored.There is a consciousness present in everything around us, the “Gaia”consciousness as described by James Lovelock, and in genuine crop circleformations, owing to their very size and complexity, there is evidence of anadditional intelligence, intent, and focusing.A now-deceased old friend, Colette Ardagh, after visiting the Corhampton circlein Hampshire in 2001, had an extraordinary cure. Shortly before our visit,Colette had broken her collarbone and was still receiving regular physicaltherapy.While in the field I had asked everyone to collect a few stones as markers, foruse in marking out certain areas for further research, without thinking thatColette might have a problem. To her amazement she was able to stretch out herdamaged shoulder quite easily to pick up the stones.A few days later she attended her physical therapy appointment. Her regularphysiotherapist was on holiday, so she was seen by a replacement physiotherapistwho, on examining her shoulder, looked puzzled and asked Colette if she hadreally broken her collarbone since the usual bump (there for life) marking wherethe bone mends was not present! The physiotherapist was astonished, as she hadnever seen this effect before.In 2011 Jackie Faulkner, one of my volunteers for our scientific research day inJuly, had long suffered from a sore bunion and had difficulty walking anydistance. Returning home after being inside the circle at Barbury Castle,Wiltshire, she found to her amazement that the bunion had diminished in size,and the skin was loose and flabby instead of tightly stretched. A bunion ispainful: it is a bony deformity of the joint at the base of the big toe, knownas the meta-tarsophalangeal joint. Sadly the reduction was only temporary, butone has to ask—how can a bony structure reduce in size even for a short periodof time?I COULDN’T SLEEP BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN MY NECKSadly, it is not possible to follow up on every case to establish if the curehas been permanent. However, I would like to present two cases of permanenthealing to date.Steve Meredith sent me a fascinating report, which needs further investigation.He told me that he had had a bad waterskiing accident in his youth. He hadpulled muscles badly in his neck but recovered well. About ten years later hestarted to suffer increasingly bad neck pains that were diagnosed as arthritis.By the summer of 2009, he was finding it hard to get any sleep at night.image [images/9781620558683_009.jpg]Fig. 1.8. Corhampton, Hampshire, June 18, 2001.image [images/9781620558683_010.jpg]Fig. 1.9. Barbury Castle, Wroughton, Wiltshire, July 2, 2011.In August 2009 he and his wife took their caravan to Wiltshire. Being in thecaravan he found it even more difficult to get any sleep and could only do so byusing a special pillow and lying on one side of his head.While in Wiltshire they visited several crop circles in the Marlborough area,about twelve or thirteen in all, but it was during his visit to the“Hummingbird” formation at Stanton St. Bernard, Milk Hill, that he realized thatthe pains in his neck had completely disappeared.I am 99.5 percent free of pain. I get the odd tingle now and then. In the daysleading up to that day I was in terrible pain and could hardly sleep at night,but the evening after we went in I was free of pain. The relief was tremendousand this continued for several months with only the occasional twinge untilafter a flight to Antigua and back, when they returned noticeably.I have been in touch with him regularly since then, and he tells me that hisneck is still 70 percent better than it had been prior to his visit to the“Hummingbird.”Many people are researching the damaging effects of radio masts; also there is agrowing amount of literature and research into the beneficial properties ofpulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs).Milk Hill, at 295 meters (968 feet), is one of the highest points for somemiles. This is relevant as Steve Meredith and his wife were staying in analuminum-walled caravan, which would concentrate the signals. Possibly astanding wave developed in which he slept. Could it be that the combination offrequency, amplitude, and pulse rate with rise and fall time of the signals didthe trick?I WAS NO LONGER HOBBLINGThe next report comes from Sue Bowness. In 2010 she went on the GlastonburySymposium crop circle tour but with damaged hamstrings she was not hopeful ofbeing able to walk any distance into a crop circle. The coach stopped at theVernham Dean formation, Hampshire, and Sue hobbled up the field into the circle.image [images/9781620558683_011.jpg]Fig. 1.10. The Hummingbird, Stanton St. Bernard, Milk Hill, Wiltshire, July 2,2009.image [images/9781620558683_012.jpg]Fig. 1.11. Vernham Dean, Fosbury, Hampshire, July 17, 2010.At the time of the tour I had damaged hamstrings in both legs stemming fromDecember 2009 and was walking unevenly and had had an aching neck for two weeks.As soon as I reached the road (after visiting the formation) and took a fewstrides, I realized I was no longer hobbling but walking evenly, with my stridelengthened to what it had been before the injuries. I felt rebalanced. Thedizziness and aching neck persisted for another two weeks or so but are nowgone.I have been in regular touch with Sue, and she tells me the cure has indeed beenmaintained.There is often an extraordinary feeling of sanctity within the circles; itreminds one of the wondrous cathedral at Chartres, and one feels overcome withawe and wonderment. I find this experience incredibly humbling, as though I havebeen touched by the Hand of God, and as is the case when treading on consecratedground, one must behave accordingly, treating the moment with reverence. It isan experience one never forgets; it is as though for one brief period of timeyou are a flame within the Flame, having risen beyond the fetters of earthlyconstraints. I call it the “cathedral effect.”A wonderful sense of “Oneness” is often experienced. This can also be shown as aspike in the brain stem of between 18 and 18.5 Hz. This is the threshold of thethree major sensory systems: sight, sound, and touch.THE CATHEDRAL EFFECTOn entering the formation I felt a strong, warm inner glow, accompanied byhigh-frequency sounds around my head. I felt a little weakness in my legs, whichhas happened before in crop circles. I felt drawn to talk to people and foundthe unusually high level of openness that I have often experienced with peoplein crop circles in the past. To me, this is a real contrast to normal everydaylife wherein people don’t really communicate; they are so busy just living theirroles day to day in a rather isolated existence. The crop formations seem tobring everything out of people that would not normally be discussed in everydaylife. There was a remarkably joyous feeling of “Oneness” with the Universe.Other reports tell us: * “I felt peaceful, blissful and close to God, so I sat for a long time and meditated.” * “Experienced tingling sensations in my legs. I sat and meditated in the green center on the apex and felt a tremendous sense of well-being and an elongation of the spine. Breathing out, I descended down a pole toward the center of the Earth, inhaling as I went up the pole into an infinite Universe. Because I had tight muscles in my neck from the airplane flight, I lay down and positioned my neck right over the center apex, a fulcrum of energy, and relaxed and felt the muscle spasm melt into relaxation. It was just a wonderful experience.” * “Emotionally charged and felt an intense sense of love-impersonal which lasted about an hour.” * “I had an overwhelming feeling of vastness, wonder, and love—like things I had known deep within about other states of consciousness and dimensions were real.”I will close this chapter with a lovely story about my favorite 2014 circle,which appeared on July 8 at Tetbury Lane, near Charlton in Wiltshire. Despitethe farmer refusing admission, it graced the landscape for several weeks.It was a geometrically harmonious formation made up of a tripod of smalltriangles inside a broken triangle, which in turn was surrounded by a brokencircle (see here [9781620558683_c01.xhtml#pg18]).It seems that the young owner-farmer was not getting on all that well with hisgirlfriend at the time—that is until they visited the circle one glorious, warm,sunny evening, and all their differences were resolved.Circles can unexpectedly work their magic.COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]With this background we are now in a position to address the key issue of thisbook—how does all this energy result in healing?The origins of the vibrational approach to healing have a long history, goingback at least to the Yogic Period in India around 6000 BCE. It is well acceptedin both esoteric scenarios and mainstream physics that the Cosmos is pervaded bya variety of cyclical processes. Everyone, even from a young age, is aware ofour day-night cycle. Such a process, due of course to Earth rotation, definesour clock cycle. Likewise, we have our annual cycle and, even more abstruse,there is the Mayan Galactic Cycle. In other words, the whole Cosmos is cyclical.We are just beginning to comprehend that frequencies of all kinds, having beenthe basis of cosmic structure, have in due course filtered down to livingmatter, which may not be unique in the Cosmos but, beyond Earth, appears to berare.image [images/9781620558683_013.jpg]Fig. 1.12. Tetbury Lane, near Charlton, Wiltshire. Reported July 8, 2014. Atripod of small triangles inside a broken triangle, which, in turn, issurrounded by a broken circle. Barley, approx. 130-feet diameter. (See fig. 1.13below for a view of the circle within the larger landscape.)Everyone soon comprehends that if something is vibrating strongly then nearbyobjects vibrate in harmony with this source. This is termed “forced or inducedvibration.” Although many people have encountered the phenomenon, the idea thatliving matter may also vibrate in sympathy with its environment is far lessknown and still little accepted. The primary reason for this is that evenmainstream practitioners are totally unaware of the two domains of science.image [images/9781620558683_014.jpg]Fig. 1.13. Tetbury Lane, near Charlton, Wiltshire, July 8, 2014.However, the concept of mind and matter (see Descartes) is well documented inancient philosophy.The modern view is that mind only exists in the brain; whereas a moreappropriate description is that we are like sponges in the ocean. Mind permeatesthe body with measurable frequencies from around the Earth’s Schumann frequencyof some 8 Hz to around 20 kHz. Analysis of these frequencies using the latestEEG equipment will enable correlations to be made between the embeddedfrequencies due to, say, Parkinson’s disease and how ambient crop circlefrequencies can retune the brain, at least on a temporary basis, as currentlyunderstood.The latest radionics equipment, now entering the European market, will not onlybe able to detect frequency misalignment problems but will be able to retune theappropriate mistuned body functions. This will lead us to a furtherunderstanding of the crop circle element. This is the future of medicine. Thecrop circle scenario is leading the way."},{"pageContent":"2“ONENESS” AND COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESSHow can you prove whether at this moment we are sleeping, and all our thoughtsare a dream; or whether we are awake, and talking to one another in the wakingstate?PLATO (427–347 BCE),SOME OF THE MOST OUTSTANDING and beautiful reports I have received over the manyyears are ones where people have experienced sensations of “upliftment,” peace,Universal Love, and a feeling of “Oneness” with all mankind. So intense havethese been at times that the person has struggled to express it in the ordinaryEarth-time words we use.I regret to admit that one of our national failings in Britain is our seeminginability to talk to strangers easily. We are naturally reserved. Many are thestories of professionals traveling up to London by train (or elsewhere) to work,sitting in the same carriage with the same occupants for years and still notknowing their names. Our customary method is to hastily bury our heads in themorning or evening newspaper, having bid a general “good morning” or “goodbye,”and that’s all!So, as a result, finding that we are actually talking quite happily to strangersinside a crop circle is well outside our normal behavior, and it is even moreastonishing to actually experience a sense of “Oneness” with the other peoplepresent—a remarkable experience indeed for us who are sometimes regarded asbeing “stuffy” Brits! So what is happening?Just as we sometimes find that we are on the same wavelength as another person,owing to our frequencies being compatible (a scientific explanation), so when weare inside the circle we have entered a different Consciousness in which all ourfrequencies have unconsciously gelled together in a unique union of “energy.”This feeling of Universal Love and “Oneness” continues for some time afterleaving the crop circle.Often have I been inside a circle and been able to see and hear the trafficroaring by but at the same time have not been a part of it, but “outside” it,having a feeling of being in a different world, safe and secure as though backin the womb, with the two existences acting simultaneously.Entering the circles, I find that there is a pull and desire to sit and meditateand let myself drift away into other dimensions, other levels of consciousness.In these altered states ideas can often pop into one’s head so unexpectedly thatone wonders where on Earth they came from! Indeed I believe they do not comefrom our often rather dense earthly energy states here on Earth but from anexterior energy outside our being. Once when I was sitting quietly meditating, Ibecame aware that I was surrounded in light. It was a strong white lighttempered by pale pink, lilac, and orange. The light was constantly moving and Ifelt happy and peaceful except for pressure round my temples where the whitelight seemed to be trying to penetrate.I made my body into a hollow shell and allowed the white light to enter, lettingit pass down to all regions, being conscious of its passage as it went. Myfingers and toes started to tingle a lot, and my whole body became light, notjust in color but also in substance. It seemed as though the light wereadjusting the chakras as it passed along.One has to wonder from whence comes the inspiration for certain musicians towrite such glorious and soul-linking music that transports a person into anotherworld. Similarly the same question could be asked of poets, singers, and artistsworking in other forms of art. Indeed the frequencies involved seem to play amajor part in this, and as demonstrated in later chapters in this book, numberand music are related, and crop circles are giving off unseen frequencies,influencing our inner beings.Over the years many groups have attempted to link into the consciousness behindthe crop circles in order to manifest a circle of a particular shape, design, orconstruction—some with extraordinary success.Perhaps the major outcome of crop circles and Earth Energy effects in general isthat the phenomenon is closely linked to human consciousness. It is as ifformations appear according to an unpredictable amalgam of human intent!It is clearly being revealed that the dominant paradigm will in due course beseen to be holistic, implying the connectivity of everything. The interaction ofour intent with the Cosmos is already (re)establishing itself as a major factorin our overall understanding of how the Universe functions.One example was reported by Simon Masters, who sent me this intriguing report.CROP CIRCLES AND INTENTIONALITYOn Thursday, July 23, 2009, around thirty local people attended a talk by GlennBroughton, a visiting researcher, tour guide, and expert on the subject of “CropCircles” at Sheldon village hall, near Dunkerswell.The following day the crop circle [shown in figures 2.1 and 2.2] was reported.What follows is an account of the processes that immediately predated andpostdated the appearance of the pattern [in figure 2.1] and were connected bygroup intentionality.My homework for the event had consisted of a cursory review of internetphotography of crop circles. Some of these I had earmarked as “fakes” in thesense that I believed them to be photographic manipulations. Prior to themeeting I had been impressed by the artistic form of the circles, which havedeveloped both in terms of intricacy and sophistication of execution since Ilast reviewed the phenomenon. Simple circles, such as the one that appeared onthe Millerton bypass that kindled my personal interest some fifteen years ago,are not significant news any longer.During the meeting’s Q and A session I asked: “As someone who has visited over250 crop patterns, what kind of intelligence do you feel lies behind thephenomenon?”Glenn had suggested that he did not want to give explanations, but described hissense that “[the intelligence is] a playful one, one that enjoys interactingwith human minds.”Several of us remarked that we found this comment very interesting.The scientist in me called on me to find a rational and simple explanation forthe patterns I see. Employing Occam’s Razor I conclude the creators have to be agroup of [human] land artists, some of whom are involved in the occult studiesof divine proportion and sacred geometry and who have a remarkable talent forevading detection during the creation of their art.Glen however had earlier described an “experiment” he had conducted with anothergroup, in which the individuals present had, effectively, “asked the circlecreators to produce a circle for them.” He reported that—remarkably, and as ifon cue—the next significant pattern to be reported had held, for him, a personaland a numerical connection with his experiment. Although inelegant, the patternreported contained the same number of circles as minds engaged with theexperiment.My response was to encourage Glenn to continue to conduct such experiments in a“scientific” manner, but given that we all appeared to share Glenn’s “sense ofthe playful,” could we play now? I cannot remember precisely but I asked, “Iseveryone here up for a group meditation, with the intention of asking the CircleMakers to create a work that speaks to us as a group?” The hall was hastilycleared of chairs, and twenty-five people held hands and were taken through aguided thought process by Glenn’s wife, Cameron.image [images/9781620558683_015.jpg]Fig. 2.1. Ogbourne St. George, Wiltshire, July 24, 2009.image [images/9781620558683_016.jpg]Fig. 2.2. Ogbourne St. George shown within the larger landscape, Wiltshire, July24, 2009.Those unwilling to participate were unobtrusive observers or had left the hallby this stage, and in a ten-minute exercise that was not without mirth andlaughter, the group focused their intent on building “our” crop circle pattern.There was no mention of specificity of timing or pattern. I remember beingsurprised that, as well as counting the participants (I was number 8 and Sarah9), Glenn showed some interest in the fact that sixteen females and nine malestook part. My personal state was one of “contentment” and “nonattachment tooutcome,” and I was not cognizant of my gender during the meditation.As mentioned above, the following day a formation was reported. Since readingthe report on Saturday the twenty-sixth, my mind has been periodically intenselyreflective on the process and finding some form of explanation or meaning forwhat has happened. I have an interest in practical magic, but it is not everyday I attempt a collaborative manifestation or demonstration of this nature.Some specific aspects of “connectedness” or cause-and-effect phenomena may beworth mentioning. 1. In later discussion, it emerged that Glenn had the intention of doing aguided meditation but was reluctant to initiate such an exercise with anunfamiliar group. It would seem that my spontaneous suggestion facilitated hisintent. Furthermore I noted my ego—my reaction to this—and was pleasantlysurprised to find “I” felt comfortable with my contribution to the groupprocess.2. The pattern consists of 12 large and 12 small circles, plus a central circle,making 25 circles in all. The pattern has the layout of a clock face andtherefore can be interpreted as depicting an analogue device for measuring time.It also has the gross symmetry of a snowflake. Closer examination revealsthreefold rotational symmetry.3. We can note that 9 (males) + 16 (females) = 25 (circles) = 12 + 12 + 1, butalso that 3^2+4^2=5^2. That is to say the numbers of males and femalesassociated with the creative process have a relation to a right angled triangleof sides 3, 4, and 5 units in length, and of course that the formation is onesolution to the Dionysian polynomial: x^2 + y^2 = z^2.4. Our group met near Dunkerswell, which is one of three aerodrome fields builtprincipally by the Americans during World War II on the Blackdown Hills. Theothers are at Smeatharpe and Tricky Warren (Culmhead). The pattern appeared atSmeathe’s Plantation near Ogbourne Down Gallop, Wiltshire.My position oscillates between “belief ” that we had some cause-andeffectrelationship to this particular circle, and “rejection” that the whole thing iscoincidence. The following explanations (or cause-and-effect models) exist: * “Our” circle does not exist; it is a Photoshop hoax. * “Our” circle exists, but the numerical coincidence is insignificant and there is no cause-and-effect (or synchronicity) relationship between what took place at Sheldon and the Smeathe’s Plantation crop circle. * “Our” circle exists, but there was direct human-to-human communication between one or more people present at Sheldon village hall and the “artist” behind “our” circle. * These explanations are not mutually exclusive.My coauthor James Lyons said, “So, in conclusion, the phenomenon is notexplained and I suggest that further work is required.”Is there indeed a consciousness inherent in the crop circle that links itself tothe human mind/body or vice versa? To me the answer is a resounding yes, asshown by this story.Researcher Marvin Naylor reported,When I was there in the Cheesefoot Head circle, two women turned up. One in herseventies, the other late forties, I think. They said they didn’t know exactlywhere the formation was but sensed it—they could “feel” it in their stomachs—asthey got nearer in the car. They said it was quite common for them to get thatfeeling, especially with fresh formations, and especially the younger one. Isaid they should contact you and tell you. (I said I’d tell you, anyway.) So youmight hear from them.THE OPEN DOORA final strange event occurred this past summer of 2018. I met Sue Dury at anairfield as she was waiting to fly after one of my crop circle tours. This is avery popular optional extra of the tour. Flying over the crop circles and thesurrounding ancient sites, such as the wonderful Avebury stone complex andSilbury Hill, adds to the magic of the whole day as we soar over the sacredlandscape of our ancestors seeing it in all its glory below.image [images/9781620558683_017.jpg]Figs. 2.3 and 2.4. Cheesefoot Head, near Winchester, Hampshire, June 17, 2017.Her son Josh was with her, and he too had had a strange experience, but it ishers I am going to tell you about due to its extraordinary uniqueness.When Josh and I went to visit a Crop Circle Formation at Yarnbury Castle on the25th of June, we sat down inside the circle. After discussing white balls oflight, Josh told me that if you ask the crop circle makers for a certain designthey would make it for you. I would like to think that I am a very down-to-earthperson but thought I would give it a go.I said out loud, “Crop circle makers if you really exist then please can youmake me a design of a door or window?” (I was thinking of moving house at thetime.) This design was really off the wall as normally the designs are of starsor flowers.I said, “If you make this for me then I will believe in you.”Lo and Behold, a month later, a crop circle formation was reported at Fovant andguess what it was of? A Door!!!I couldn’t believe it as it was such a strange design to ask for. Nobody couldhave overheard our conversation. There was nobody else there! I felt this onewas made for me.image [images/9781620558683_018.jpg]Fig. 2.5. Gurston Ashes, near Fovant, Wiltshire, July 23, 2018, circa 90 ft(27.5m) diameter. Wheat circle containing a rectangular door.I have to believe in the crop circle makers now as they did what I asked for.Josh asked me what connection I had with Fovant. The only connection I had withFovant was that I took my mother to see the white chalk badges many years agonow. She has since passed but it makes you wonder if there is a spiritualconnection. Was it my mother’s way of contacting me? I have no answer for this.The circle was lying hidden above the White Chalk Military Badges carved intothe hillside above Fovant and was hard to find. Yet again we have thisconnection with the Universal Conscious Mind in all its teasing and Puckishways.What is this telling us, I wonder? As with many crop circles, it is open tomultiple interpretations that may be whispering different words to both you andme. Bizarre and indeed trite as the crop circle may seem at first glance, whenone looks into this image more deeply, one starts to question what an openingdoor could be saying to us? What does it mean?An open door, may be giving us the opportunity of “opening” us to a newdirection in life, new opportunities, accessing new dimensions, or raising us toother levels of consciousness. Whatever the answer, I see it as quite one of themost important and inspirational circles of 2018.image [images/9781620558683_019.jpg]Fig. 2.6.

Wiltshire Regiment.6. 5th (City of London Battalion), London Regiment (London Rifle Brigade). 7.8th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Post Office Rifles) 8.Devonshire Regiment.I believe that we are all part of the Universal Consciousness, which ismultidimensional and multi-interactional. This being so, we have to take onboard the awesome fact that in this we are indeed all part of each other.COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]Hitherto the topic of conscious connection to crop formations and Earth Energyeffects in general has been virtually unknown territory in mainstream science.However, many recent long-range conscious effects, ranging from TranscendentalMeditation to quantum entanglement have been thoroughly investigated. Thesestudies indicate that “intent” is a key part of cosmic processes.One very recent theory to emerge in the last decade is Global Scaling Theory.This is based on the concept that the Universe is structured on the basis ofstanding cosmic waves in logarithmic space. This technical term is in principlesimilar to the way that harmonic structures are an integral part of music.If objects have been physically linked then separated, they remain consciouslyconnected—a key example being the case of identical twins. Alternatively,focusing mentally on any scene, however distant, also establishes a link betweenthe person creating intent and the object of visualization. It is currentlybeing suggested that the standing wave resembles a vortex filament, somethingwell known in physics, particularly Cosmology.Since by definition a standing wave does not propagate, its nodes are the keyelements of the wave, which are coherently linked. This means that informationavailable at either node is instantaneously available at the other. This processis essentially a holographic scenario.The research organization*1 [9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft1] undertaking this workhas used the technique to transmit messages even from Europe to Australia bytapping directly into this universal energy field! The process is showingremarkable similarities to the nonlocal conscious effects observed in the cropcircle phenomenon.Patterns of Intent from one or more meditators can collectively create orbs,which are capable of coherently forming and manifesting patterns closely basedon the combined thought processes of the participants."},{"pageContent":"3DOWSING IN CROP CIRCLES AND LABYRINTHSNo man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in thedawning of your knowledge. For the vision of one man lends not its wings toanother man.THE PROPHET BY KAHLIL GIBRAN (1883–1931)I ALWAYS ORGANIZE AN ANNUAL CROP CIRCLE scientific research day (see chapter 8),and scientist and dowser Bob Sephton was one of my regular attendees for manyyears until his health prevented him from coming. In 2014 he wrote telling methatmy bladder cancer has returned so I am now having chemo from time to time duringthe next few weeks. I decided to summarize all my defects/problems on a list andsee what can be done. Cancer, left ankle “shattered” (some years ago), lefteyesight not too good, balance is terrible, both knees stiff, kidneys not toogood, to name a few. I am eighty-six in a few weeks’ time but NOT yet ready to“bow out.”I dowsed that I could do something about all this. Chemicals—No,Homeopathic—Yes. But I don’t have all of them. “Yes you do! You are looking atphotographs from your Crop Circles Calendar.” . . . In front of me was a scrapbook in which each year I stick in photographs from your Crop Circles Calendar.I dowsed which Crop Circle would be appropriate for a specific problem.Holding his pendulum over the appropriate circle for each ailment, it wouldstart spinning and stop when the treatment was completed.So make of this what you will. It is having an effect; some results have workedquicker than others. The European Union is trying to make a rule that onlydoctors can prescribe homeopathic treatments, which means that they will not. Sodo your own by dowsing for the selected image; place a hand over the appropriatephotograph and use your pendulum to tell you when one has had enough; it is assimple as that. Check from time to time to see if one has to change the photofor the problem.I am a migraine sufferer and had been enduring terrible headaches for almost twoweeks, which my normal medicine and powders were doing nothing to relieve. Sowhen I received Bob Sephton’s email I thought—why not give it a try?Getting out several of my old calendars and sitting comfortably in a chair, Istarted dowsing image after image . . . nothing . . . nothing . . . thensuddenly my pendulum went wild over the beautifully harmonious 2013 Hackpenformation. Amazed, I got a larger overhead image of the circle and stared at it.Horrors, it was all jagged and sharp and really unpleasant. Could I bear to goon looking? My pendulum never lies to me, so I persevered and got more and morefascinated as the circle started to change shape before my eyes. It evolved into3-D patterns! How long I watched all this happening I really don’t know, butsuddenly I realized that I no longer had a migraine! It had gone completely.I now keep a photograph of this formation in my bag alongside the powders as afallback, as it is not always possible to find a place to sit and stare at aphotograph!A BIRTHDAY PRESENTNot long after this experience I was giving a talk at the lovely GlastonburySymposium and, as always, I finish with a musical slide show of crop circleimages from over the years. This is always popular—an emotional release intoother wonderful levels of consciousness. I was sent a lovely, heartwarmingreport by one of the viewers.Thank you for your wonderful presentation on crop circles at the GlastonburySymposium, and for taking the time to search for the crop circle that created myepisode of intense emotion, which combined feelings of “love, release, knowing,and meaning.”image [images/9781620558683_020.jpg]Figs. 3.1 and 3.2.

West Woods, Lockeridge, Wiltshire, July 17, 2008.It wasn’t until your presentation on July 27 (my fifty-first birthday!) that Irealized “my past, my present, and my future” . . . in other words “my purpose”came to being. The first three crop circles (they were different views of thesame circle) that you showed in your “sight and sound” presentation hit me sopowerfully that I wasn’t able to breathe; I had an intense release of emotion .. . feelings of “love/release/knowing/meaning.” . . . I had palpitations in apoint above my heart, which I have now learned is the “Thymus Chakra.”As we travel further into the different areas of healing we find we are treadingan unlikely and unexpected path. How could it be that labyrinths, dowsing, andhealing are part of the same interwoven fabric?It is only as we continue our journey of exploration that we find that certainthreads connect all three.image [images/9781620558683_022.jpg]Fig. 3.4. West Woods, Lockeridge, Wiltshire, July 17, 2008.HUNT THE CIRCLEMany years ago when the crop circles were appearing in great quantities inHampshire, I had a strange and somewhat uncomfortable experience. Ex–SecondWorld War Burma bomber pilot and renowned dowser David Russell had flown overand seen from the air a crop circle in a field just off the A272 in Hampshirenear Winchester. Realizing that the circle was on flat ground and would bedifficult to find, and while the image was still clear in his mind, he made hisway to the field as soon as he landed and managed to find it.image [images/9781620558683_023.jpg]Fig. 3.5. David Russell.David had found some very interesting dowsing patterns and had asked me to seewhat I could detect with my pendulum. Needless to say, I never did find it, soit seemed a heaven-sent opportunity when some four or five weeks later, on asoaking wet day, we went on an expedition to try and locate it together withHamish Miller (who discovered the Michael and Mary ley lines and is author ofThe Sun and the Serpent) and David’s wife, Barbara.We made our way to the field. There was a path running the length of the fielddown one side. It soon became clear to us that we were going to have difficultylocating the circle for as far as our eyes could reach was an endless sea ofbarley and no vantage point from which to see into the crop.I realized that I had left my pendulum in the car parked some distance away fromthe field, and I had not even brought my dowsing rods either. Drat and doubledrat! As we were walking down the path suddenly I felt a tight band around myhead. “Stop,” I called to David, who had gone ahead. “The circle is here,” Isaid, pointing into the field. David felt sure it was further on but as the bandaround my head seemed to be tightening still more, he obligingly went into thefield but went off at an angle and soon was lost to sight in the waves of palegolden stalks of barley. In despair I borrowed Barbara’s dowsing rods and askedthem to indicate where the circle was. They pointed straight into the field fromwhere we were standing, and I entered where David had, but instead of going offat an oblique angle, I followed the rods down the tramline at 90 degrees to thepath. It seemed as though we were walking forever, and I started to doubt mydowsing ability—however, some 70 or 80 yards later I suddenly saw the circleliterally two steps in front of me. It was a beautiful double ringer, whichclearly had had few if any other visitors apart from David and now us. Themoment I stepped into it an extraordinary thing happened; the band of steel wascompletely lifted from my poor aching head. What a relief!I have spoken to several people since that experience, and I am told that it isa well-known fact that we may use our bodies as dowsing instruments. Howeversince that day, I always make a point of trying to remember to bring my rods inorder to locate circles in this way, as so many of them are not visible from theground. I am sure most dowsers do the same. Bands of steel do not appeal to me,so I am always careful to make sure I have my rods or pendulum with me, I evenused my handbag once, but I suppose it is a useful means if all else fails! Ihave always suffered from a notoriously poor bump of location (sense ofdirection) but ever since that wet and soggy day, it has improved quitedramatically. Maybe something was unblocked as a result of our expedition!So many things seem to happen by chance and yet, I ask myself, are they reallyjust “by chance” or are they whisperings which we can either listen to orignore?There are many dowsers among my scientific research group who, in addition tobeing scientists, are in the process of trying to put dowsing on a scientificbasis and indeed are close to establishing this.LONG-DISTANCE COMMUNICATION?Hugo Jenks (looking like a man from outer space) was busy with his program.The angle of my electronic L rod is measured by an angle sensor fitted in therod handle and plotted on the image as a grey shade. The GPS lat/long positionis updated once per second, and so each dot represents one second of measurementat that position.When the rod is straight ahead it gives a mid-grey dot, when 90 degrees or moreright it is white, 90 degrees or more left it is black with shades of grey inbetween.image [images/9781620558683_024.jpg]Fig. 3.6. Hugo Jenks during a scientific research day at Forest Hill, Wiltshire,on July 16, 2014.I was simply asking to be shown the strength of the energy at the point where Iwas walking.Ideally I would have made my tracks closer together, but I was aware that theremay be limited time. It was quite a large area; to cover it in fine detail wouldtake several hours.It is also hard work to maintain focus. For example at about the three o’clockposition there is a large area of consistent white indicated about 20 meterslong and 8 meters wide. However, you will see a kink in my path, and noindicated energy. My focus went from dowsing to avoiding some people standingthere. So the indications in that kink section are to be ignored.image [images/9781620558683_025.jpg]Fig. 3.7. Hugo Jenks’s GPS results.I have a button on the handle. When pressed the dot is shown as yellow. I usethat to draw the outline of physically visible items, such as hedges or standingstones, in this case the perimeter of the circle.Note that the indicated GPS position does wander a little. So the yellow outlinedoes not quite meet the point where I started, by about a meter (see fig. 3.7above). Not too bad really on this scale, but be aware that consistentmeasurements of small scales are hard to achieve with the GPS wandering aroundby +/− a meter or so. Hence some energy lines although straight in reality canappear a bit jagged.I do feel we need a scientific approach to dowsing. It will take some legwork toget there.The big advantage of my rod is that the indication is continuously variable,like the volume control on a radio. It has the ability to indicate subtlefeatures if repeated on successive tracks. The eye can pick out the featureafterward even if you did not notice a particularly strong response at the time.Usually those who use flags have to make a decision at the time of dowsingwhether to place the flag or not. It is like the on-off button on a radio. Youhave to listen to it full blast or not at all. Placing the flag also forces youto switch your mental mode from being receptive to being decisive and back. Withmy system, provided you can maintain focus, you can remain continuously in thereceptive mode.FINDING THE WAYSo how do labyrinths fit into this equation? The crop circle phenomenon takes meall over the world giving talks—to places I would never have the opportunity tovisit otherwise. One of these was to lecture at the Labyrinth Society’s annualconference in Taos, New Mexico, in the autumn of 2014. Was it by chance that twowonderful crop circle labyrinths had appeared as heralds in the fields inWiltshire that very summer? After giving my lecture I was given an introductionto labyrinth designer and builder Marty Cain.In June of 1994, about twelve people came to a workshop I gave in conjunctionwith an art project called “Art in Nature” sponsored by the New Art Center inNewton, Massachusetts, and the National Endowment for the Arts. I taught themall to dowse. We each walked my temporary labyrinth marked with white turkeyfeathers and used our new skill to find our way into the park and locate sacredspots of our own. At the end of the day one woman shared that she had once beenattacked in the woods and had not gone near a forest in years. This day sheovercame her fear and followed her dowsing rods deep into the woods. She waselated with this new freedom and gave credit to walking the labyrinth. Othersreported insights and told me of being cleared from mental blocks. There was anoverall sense of well-being, wonder, and fun.image [images/9781620558683_026.jpg]Fig. 3 8. Forest Hill, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, July 16, 2014.Another Massachusetts art project found me working with special-educationstudents at Somerville High School. The Somerville Arts Council commissioned meto work with them to build a community labyrinth at the Somerville GrowingCenter, a block down Vinal Street from the high school. I showed the studentsslides of ancient sites, taught the teens to dowse, and to draw the labyrinth.We worked together using donated bricks imbedded in the new turf so there wouldbe a minimum of maintenance and allow for the varied use of the space. Thestudents all had special needs that kept them from taking regular classes. Oneboy, I’ll call him Jim, had never spoken a full sentence in his life.We walked down to the garden center, dowsed the form, and marked it with bluesurveyors’ flags and tape. Together we created a blessing, walked in processionthrough the labyrinth, and then headed back up the hill for lunch in the schoolcafeteria. That afternoon we were to return to start cutting the turf andplacing the bricks to mark the paths. Jim called to his teacher saying, “I wishI could come back after lunch but I have health class.” Everybody stopped intheir tracks. Even Jim was shocked. After lunch Jim and the whole health classcame to the garden center to walk the labyrinth.The next day Jim would not walk the labyrinth. I asked why. “Lost,” he said.“Lost!” Finally he managed to have me understand that his family relied on theincome the state provided for his disability and that he had never been taughtenough to keep up with normal students and would be lost. “Lost!” He said. Notin the labyrinth but in his life. I suggested that he continue to work on theproject and in two years when he was to graduate and his obligation to hisfamily was fulfilled, he return to walk the labyrinth. He could start hiseducation newly, fully able to express himself. We embraced, both with tears inour eyes. Later the staff of the growing center said he was always there,working to keep the labyrinth perfect. What happened to this boy in thelabyrinth? I do not know, but I was more determined than ever to understand thepower of walking a labyrinth.In the early nineties I had teamed up with Dr. Wayne London of Brattleboro,Vermont, to study the effects of using sacred space to heal diseases. During aworkshop in Putney, Vermont, a seventy-two-year-old gentleman, who had beensuffering with Parkinson’s disease for fifteen years, shuffled slowly into thecenter of a small temporary labyrinth that I had dowsed and marked with moundsof hay and surveyors flags. When he came out he was taking full strides andsmiling from ear to ear. All symptoms of his crippling disease had vanished. Ichanced to meet him four months later and noticed that his symptoms werereturning. When I offered to build a labyrinth at his home in Virginia he andhis wife refused. That was hard for me to understand.Collaborating again with Wayne London when giving a lecture, this time inCraftsbury, Vermont, people reported being able to see more clearly and richly,with a sense of both more depth and brighter colors. In two other cases theirsense of smell was enhanced.Early one morning a client called me from Georgia to report that a blind priestwith Parkinson’s disease had just walked her labyrinth supported by his wife.They slowly made their way to the center but, as they were on their way out, hewas walking freely and simply holding her hand. Two days later, the couplereturned and when the labyrinth owner saw the man walking briskly by himself sheran to the entrance to meet him as he ended his walk. He told her that he wasable to go alone because when he had come to the entrance, two gnomes were thereto lead him along the paths.These reports are of people who walked the labyrinth just once or twice. I knowof little that has been done to document what happens when labyrinths are walkedevery day over a long period of time.So how do we explain how or why this “labyrinth effect” is happening? I think wemust refer to Pythagoras: “If we accept that numbers and music are related andlabyrinths are constructed not just in geometric forms but in such patterns thatgive off special frequencies, then the mystery starts to unravel.”THE HEALING ROOMI believe that so much of this work is all about “frequencies.” We areelectrical beings interacting with other invisible electrical frequencies. Afriend of mine has a special healing room, and she explains that color, as atool for healing and spiritual development, has been used over many periods oftime. Many years ago she worked with an amazing medium who designed a colorwheel and she has been using it in her healing room for over thirty years. It isan electrical machine that simply consists of two discs overlaid with coloredgels that are arranged in a specific formula. When the machine is switched on,the discs rotate and through the use of a halogen bulb the color is beamedthrough a projector and reflects onto the wall. This allows a person to come andsit in this energy field and the color is absorbed through the aura and has aneffect on the physical condition. She has witnessed a change in a Parkinson’ssufferer who came into the room unable to control extensive shaking and who thenbecame perfectly still and relaxed.She never consciously chooses a specific color for anyone. She prepares the roomand allows the wheel to stop randomly, always bearing in mind her connectionwith the spirit world and the power that can be invoked for that particularperson. Everyone is different, and it depends on the soul itself as to whetherit is time for a condition to be removed or whether there is still more to belearned from it.She further explains that we have to understand that the soul is a vehicle oflight expressing itself through the color spectrum according to the changingthought pattern. “As we think, so it is.” Therefore, the aura surrounding thephysical body is an electrical force field continually feeding the individualand changing the molecular and chemical structure. This has a great influence onthe health of the human being.COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]Dowsing has been used by our forefathers to detect the flowing spiralingtelluric currents in the earth. These form a grid network north-south andeast-west. At crossover points we find spiderweb-like patterns. All ancientsites up to the time of medieval churches are constructed on so-termed Earthacupuncture points. These points are key to where crop circles occur. Since ourconscious interaction with all Earth Energies depends on receiving ambientenergy structure, we simply ask appropriate questions to analyze crop circlestructures.So with dowsing we find the underlying telluric “graph paper” on which cropcircles form. This allows us to record in great detail the pattern’s fundamentalgeometries, which were first discovered and recorded by the ancient Greeks. Thisis all called sacred geometry. We analyze the underground energy patterns almostalways focusing on water sources. These are the source of energy, which rises inbubble rings from below, creating crop patterns as the crop is flattened.Dowsing can be used to measure the relevant energy distribution across aformation.The information one can extract from crop circles is very diverse. First, itexplains how human consciousness is but one element in dissecting how Naturefunctions in general. We are involved in an interchange of dynamically evolvingideas. It clearly shows that we ourselves are immersed in this self-organizingfield—we hold a conversation. Healing is but one aspect of this dialogue.Using aerial photos, it is also possible to measure from the geometry the keyharmonic features of a formation. These are almost without exception based onthe harmonics of the diatonic scale, first defined by Pythagoras. It is usuallypossible using dowsing to establish how a pattern was laid down.If, say, a pattern is based on a series of circles, then a procedure analogousto embroidery is involved, with a column of energy spiraling up through theground thus creating a localized circle, then descending back to Earthreemerging in another location. In this way sequences of circles appear tocreate an overall composite pattern. It is often the case that dowsing is usedon aerial photos to work out the creation mechanism.What is unique about crop circles is the apparent intelligence behind somepatterns. This author on several occasions has encountered formations in thefield that are closely aligned with a priori computer images hypothesized sometime earlier. This effect clearly demonstrates that the conscious link is key tothe process.Dowsing is the modern word to describe how not only humans but also all animals,birds, and fishes interact with the all-pervading cosmic energy. The Ancientscall this the Aether, while modern science calls it either the “quantum vacuum”or the “zero-point energy field.” It is the fount of all knowledge (the ancientAkashic Records). It acts as an all-knowing library like the modern internet,which one can interrogate. Time and distance are of no relevance.This is why the phenomenon so attracts those people of spiritual backgrounds.While we use dowsing to measure the energy absorbed by the crops, we stillstruggle to fully determine the obvious intelligence behind the phenomenon. Thisremains a work in progress."},{"pageContent":"4FREQUENCIES AND LUMINOSITIESAs we acquire knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but moremysterious.ALBERT SCHWEITZER (1875–1965)WHAT IS IT THAT IS AFFECTING us when we go into crop circles?As already mentioned in the book, we appear to be entering a “sphere ofinfluence” that has a profound effect on certain people. Could a change infrequency be the case?All the reports given below are in connection with crop circles, but just aswith other crop circle effects these same effects and phenomena have beenrecorded in lesser number in and around ancient stone circles. It would appearthat there is an ambient electrical field connecting the electrical field of thestones and the residual electromagnetic field of the crop circle force thatinteracts in a glorious marriage with the existing ambient field of certainenergetic spots in the landscape. These fields were understood by our ancientancestors, whose knowledge of the stars, the seasons, and the natural worldleaves us, in our manic world of technology, struggling to catch up with them.We are only just now starting to relearn and appreciate this wisdom.We will begin our investigation with oral reports. Just as I have experiencedmany of the previous effects having visited hundreds of circles, so this one isof particular interest.I CAN’T GET THAT TASTE OUT OF MY MOUTHOn certain occasions when entering a formation, I get this strange metallictaste in my mouth that is so pervasive I cannot get rid of it by spitting ordrinking or by any other means. I only ever experience this when in thesecircumstances, never at any other time. Other people have also experienced thistaste, and Debbie Benstead considers it her litmus test as to the genuineness ofa formation. Since discussing this taste in talks, I have been amazed by thenumber of people who have also experienced this sensation. Shelly Keel has alsoreported a “metallic/acid taste in my mouth.” Shelly has no metal, amalgam, orgold fillings in her mouth.The most interesting story of all came from a woman who approached me after mytalk at the 1995 CCCS Conference in Andover. “I have that taste in my mouthnow,” she announced, “and I am not in a crop circle, but I am a diet-maintaineddiabetic!” She went on to tell me that whenever her protein ketones rise to acertain level she experiences this “taste” and has to get something to eatquickly in order to correct this situation. In other words this is her warningsignal that her blood-sugar level is dropping dramatically, and she must dosomething about it.What are ketones? They are organic compounds that contain a carbonyl group (anoxygen atom doubly bonded to a carbon atom) bonded to two other organic groups.The blood ketone level in humans normally increases in response to starvation,diabetes mellitus, or a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet. Dietary changes and, indiabetes, the administration of insulin usually correct the condition.On another occasion after I had given a talk at Chevy Chase, Maryland, during alecture tour of the States and Canada, Larry Arnold, who has spent twenty-threeyears researching spontaneous human combustion,*2 [9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft2]approached me in great excitement to tell me that whereas few people survivespontaneous human combustion, he had an account of such a person, a woman who,when interviewed after the terrible event, reported experiencing the samemetallic taste.Clearly it is of electrochemical origin and can occur when an electrical fieldof specific frequency and amplitude triggers gustatory (sense of taste)receptors.SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTIONA recent theory suggests that spontaneous combustion may be due to chronicCandidiasis in which an excess amount of internal alcohol, resulting from ayeast infection, floods the bloodstream. If the body attempts to eliminate thealcohol through the skin, this will create a bubble of alcohol, vapor around thebody. If the sufferer goes near a candle or cooking flame or lights a cigaretteor pipe, the body will spontaneously combust.Furthermore, Charles Dickens in Bleak House described the death of heavy drinkerKrook:Here is a small burnt patch of flooring; here is the tender from a little bundleof burnt paper, but not so light as usual, seeming to be steeped in something;and here is—is it the cinder of a small charred and broken log of wood sprinkledwith white ashes, or is it coal, O Horror, he is here! And this, from which werun away, striking out the light and overturning one another into the street, isall that represents him.When their bodies touch the fallen crop inside a crop circle, people oftenexperience throbbing, pulsing, or tingling sensations. “I lay down with my palmson the earth and felt strong pulsing from each fingertip.”DASH TO THE DENTISTA dramatic oral effect was reported by Dr. Patricia Hill. She suffered fromlong-standing toxicity since experiencing serious food poisoning in 1984,resulting in autoimmunity, neurological and organ damage, and sensitivity. Shehad several gold crowns, one titanium implant, and one amalgam filling. She toldme,I have a strong and peculiar reaction on electrical and electronic devices.Sometimes I have reversed the polarity of such devices, causing them tomalfunction or even melt down. I set off alarms, open garage doors, blow uplights, and so forth, and have been studied because of it.Her story continued:image [images/9781620558683_027.jpg]Fig. 4 1. Devil’s Den, Clatford, Wiltshire, July 19, 1999.When friends arrived August 2, 1999, I took them to all the crop circles(starting with Devil’s Den), and one of those people, Michelle Rose, and Ideveloped a strange pain in our teeth when we went into the Devil’s Denformation. She was so miserable that she was ready to “charter the Concorde” togo home!Whilst visiting the next formation at Cherhill, blood started gushing from mygums. We both used clove oil, and so forth, to no avail, and she decided to goto a dentist and have a root canal, while I decided to wait until I got home.Due to the pain, neither of us could chew, so we had to eat soft food.My pain developed into a large abscess between two teeth—a gold crown andanother crown—above which is a titanium implant that had broken, exposing theinner core. I had horrible pain going up into my head on the left side, into theback of my head, down my neck, under my chin, into my shoulders, and to myheart.I used my detox homeopathic on the large swelling and it ruptured, filling mymouth with horrible yellow pus streaked with white. I also used Rescue Remedy,which seemed to help, but I was worried about septicemia, so I went to a doctorand asked for erythromycin.When I got home I went to my homeopath who was delighted to hear that I had“detoxed” my liver! He pointed out that the place where the abscess had been wasa liver point, and all of the places where I had felt extreme pain were alsoliver points, which had been the cause of my migraine headaches on that side.My gum and tooth are now fine with no root canal surgery! My headache is alsogone!THE NOISE SEEMED TO BE GETTING LOUDERMany are the people who have described hearing unusual noises when approachingor being inside crop circles. Indeed several people have developed tinnitus,which they connect directly with their involvement with the circles. Thecontinuous ringing in their ears is an unpleasant sensation.One report mentions:I was trying to write down how I was feeling but I could not get my mind to workwith my hand so there was a lot of scribbling out along with unprintablelanguage. The noise in my right ear was so loud I was shouting to Colin Andrews,who was with me at the time, telling him what was happening. He was havingsimilar problems.By moving toward the edge of the formation it seemed to get quieter the closer Igot to the edge.I suffer from tinnitus in my right ear and have done since an experience in acrop circle in 1990, but since I have been in the circle today, the tinnitus hasbecome so loud, I have a job to hear noise from my right ear.A woman entered another formation and was sitting quietly when she heard acrackling noise in the crop that seemed to be getting louder as it approachedher. A couple joined her, and the noise stopped abruptly.It could be that the stimulation of the hypothalamus is the reason for many ofthese reports. The cilia in the ear get activated, kicking the neurons in thesystem into action.Not all audio effects are negative: a woman member of a Yorkshire group visitinga crop circle below the ancient hill fort at Clay Hill, Wiltshire, recoveredfrom a partial hearing loss problem.We need to know what frequencies are involved and in which band (VVLF, ELF, LF,HF, VHF, UHF, Microwave). More research is needed in this area.What is the cause of tinnitus? We are told that tinnitus is the perception of asound in the ear or head that isn’t produced by an outside source. There aremany different conditions that can produce tinnitus, and sometimes it can occurfor no known reason.Neuroscience tells us that both sides of the brain are involved in hearing andsound. There is a complex system whereby communication from one ear on one sideof the head passes information to identical centers on both sides of the brain.Several parts of the brain are involved in decoding and processing sounds—thebrain stem, the midbrain, and the thalamus, and then the temporal lobe of thecerebrum.PULSING TINY LIGHTS SHAPED LIKE A DOUGHNUTLights or luminosities are often associated with crop formations and are seen asstationary, hovering, or moving over a field where the following morning a cropformation is found.Many people see little balls of light dancing inside the formation. When peoplereport luminosities not seen by other people, it must be asked: Are theydescribing visual hallucinations or physical sightings?This is another area where rigid conclusions cannot be drawn. One report tellsof a woman who saw “small glistening vortices, whirling around the flattened[grain] toward the perimeter.” Another account stated:A mass of pulsing tiny lights, shaped like a doughnut or a blood cell. It wasabout three feet across and just one foot high. It didn’t come up to meparticularly so I was surprised that no one else seemed to notice it. As Iwatched I could see red streaks like tiny lightning flashes in the sky above thecrop. The shaped light was orangey-white. Then it drifted off and speeded up andzoomed off over the hill.Later that day in Bristol I could see big bouncing orange balls of lightfollowing us, bouncing into people and being “absorbed” or dissipating intothem!The story continues with the principal player Win Keech, an engineer currentlyworking as a computer engineer. He has also worked as a designer at Rolls Royce,and was a pilot in the Royal Air Force for a short time.He has a great interest in UFOs and approaches the topic from a scientific andobjective point of view. In 1991 he witnessed a pale luminous disk above thecrop in East Field, Alton Barnes, and the subsequent appearance of a smallcircle. As the disk traveled slowly across the field it was the size of a smalldinner plate before expanding to approximately twenty feet in diameter. It thenbecame stationary, hovering over the crop; the wheat beneath shook, rattled, andfell naturally, taking only about three seconds. The disk then moved away acrossthe field contracting as it did so. Keech went to where he had seen the luminousobject and found a small circle of approximately twenty feet in diameter.A final report: “I saw a BOL (ball of light) thirty feet away from me come outof the crop and float over the heads of wheat briefly for around two to threeseconds and then disappear.”Other ocular anomalies have occurred in crop circles, such as Christopher Bean’sreport in which he experienced a “myopic effect” in 1999. (It had also occurredin 1998 when visiting two other formations.) He describes it thus: “It occurswhen looking at yellow/green stalks in a large area of flattened crop, theperipheral vision ‘zones out’ and you get a ‘glare’ in your central vision. Itusually lasts the duration of the visit to the formation.”He also reports that after his visit to the pictogram and “Serpent” in EastField, Alton Barnes, “I was so clumsy for the next two days, ripping my kneesand feet open around the house, covering myself in bruises.”image [images/9781620558683_028.jpg]Fig. 4.2. East Field Serpent, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, June 12, 1999.A similar report came from a man as he approached the same formation from thedirection of the silage pit that lies by the road running from Alton Barnes toPewsey. As he neared the formation his vision became “whurry” and his wholevision split into two halves with a horizontal line separating the two halves.One section going one way, the other section going the opposite way. His visionwas clear in the middle. He does not wear spectacles and has normal vision. Hedid not see any change in the colors, and it has not happened to him before orsince.Could the cause be due to his normal muscular conversion of the stimulus beingspontaneously distorted? The eddy currents in his brain seemed to be affected.We have neurons that run to intraocular muscles. “After some time I noticed thatthere were colors appearing in my vision (eyes closed); first red and yellow,then turquoise, varying if I moved my eyes up and down.”Seeing various colors internally could be termed as chromatism, thehallucinatory perception of colored images, which affect the eddy currents inthe brain (neurological sign of brain energies). Pulsed signals, however sourced(visual, acoustic, RF, etc., in very, very low frequency wavelengths), cantrigger migraine variant or no headache but other strange symptoms. The personis often “seeing” bright primary colors apparently in the field of view: red,yellow, and turquoise. If projected into the surrounding environment some willinterpret the vision as the Virgin Mary (turquoise) or spirits.Many people have also remarked on a new outer clarity of vision in which thescenery appears as though it is made up of sharply defined “cutouts.” A newinner clearness of vision is also often reported, as in the following:And everything looked enhanced dimensionally. I saw large lines of energy risingfrom the ground, moving upward, filling the landscape, the horizon, and the skyfor hours. The lines were wavy, pulsating, in constant movement. They just keptemanating from the ground.I kept closing my eyes to try to make it stop—it was like looking at a movie. Itwas overwhelming—lots of movement. When it got dark that evening, I could see aswell as if it was dusk all night. That was one of the things that compelled meto stay outside.Like I said before, I do see energy but I have not seen anything of thatmagnitude again. It was like being in a vision, aware of two realities. Thingsdidn’t look as they had before. I had fear around this—wondering how long thiswould last and not really knowing what was happening to me—I felt like Icouldn’t handle it. When I was able to be briefly still in what I was seeing andobserve it, I had an overwhelming feeling of vastness, wonder, and love—likethings I had known deep within about other states of consciousness anddimensions were real.It has been suggested to me that these visual effects are indicative ofphotophobia, which is a migraine variant symptom. “Fear” and “overwhelming senseof vastness” may well relate to a spike of beta waves, 18 and 18.5 Hz. In thelevels of 15 to 40 Hz intense anxiety and panic are induced.REMOTE VIEWINGDue to the frequencies associated with the qualities of some crop circle’sgeometry and sound effects, even remote viewing can bring on extreme results. Ihad an email from a young woman who had an unexpected reaction to a picture of acrop circle.I looked at all the photos and studied the diagram that was presented on thesite*3 [9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft3] in animated form. A few minutes later, Iwas sitting at my computer when I suddenly felt a bit dizzy. I got up from thechair and felt so woozy that I needed to lie down.My seven-year-old was quite concerned. I wanted a nap, but couldn’t bear to shutout my child. Suddenly my stomach felt queasy as well. I was really frightenedbecause I was so afraid something was seriously wrong with me, as I have neverfelt dizziness like that in my life, except for on an amusement ride!After a few runs to the bathroom, it suddenly occurred to me that perhaps it wasbrought on by the crop circle diagram/image. It’s been six hours since ithappened, and I still feel a tad dizzy, but not as much.I suggested she should try and look at the images again without feeling thatsomething would happen to her. She replied saying:I would certainly try to do what you suggest and look at the images again, butI’m actually afraid to do so! It was such an awful feeling! To be honest withyou, I almost feel as though I can’t bear to look at any images of cropformations without feeling extremely uneasy.It’s like when you have had a nightmare and can’t bear to see the imagesresurface in your mind. Where before I could stare at the circles all day andget nothing but good feeling from them. Perhaps that particular formation, whichpossibly brought on the ill feelings (the April 19, 2008, Waden Hill formation),was a negatively formed/charged one?It almost brings on a panicky feeling when I even just go to the website withthe prospect of checking it out again. I can’t bear to do it! Bizarre, I tellyou. If and when I do study it again, I’ll be sure to let you know whattranspired, if I don’t fall flat on the floor!Later I received this encouraging email.I have good news I finally got the nerve to check out the pictures and diagramof the April 19 circle for the second time, taking your advice to do so, whilethinking to myself that it won’t affect me in any way.image [images/9781620558683_029.jpg]Fig. 4 3. Waden Hill, near Avebury, Wiltshire, April 19, 2008This was about ten minutes ago, and whereas the last dizzying effects came uponme almost immediately after studying the photos and diagram when I looked at itfor the first time on May 4, so far nothing feels out of the ordinary. And thistime I spent more time on the site, and really concentrated on the photos anddiagram.NEW MEANINGThe pleasure some people find in looking at crop circle photographs is veryevident from the following email.I’ve been meaning to contact you about an experience I had while meditating onthe crop circle pictures in your book Crop Circles: Art in the Landscape. I findthat gazing at pictures of crop circles brings on a very meditative state forme, and I love to use your book because there isn’t a lot of text to distractme, and the photos are stunning.I was looking at the pictures on page 37 . . . and I was thinking . . . I wonderwhat these really are . . . what are they for? And a voice—it was in my head,but not of my own thoughts—said, “They are didactic crosses.”I was taken aback and quickly took a notebook and wrote down the word didactic .. . because I had never heard it before and didn’t know what it meant. So off tothe computer to Google it. And I got chills when I read the meaning: “didactic:designed or intended to teach. Intended to convey instruction and information aswell as pleasure and entertainment.”Now isn’t that beautiful? Instruction, information, teaching, and pleasurelooking at them, entertainment going into them and studying them. How perfect isthat for a compact word to describe the circles?NO WHEELCHAIRThe following is an extract of a report dictated to me by Paddy Lyons who, owingto her osteoarthritis, finds it too painful to write.In October 2016 I received an invitation (as I do annually) from Lucy Pringle toattend her annual lecture in Petersfield, Hampshire, on the crop circles of thatseason. I mentioned it to my daughter and how sad I was that I couldn’t go, towhich she replied, “I don’t see why you shouldn’t; I am going to take you.” (Wehave very little money so my husband and daughter clubbed together in order tostay at a hotel near Petersfield overnight.)My daughter drove me down to Petersfield. Unfortunately I was going through aparticularly painful period and, even when in my wheelchair, was in acute pain.We arrived at the hotel and I rested for an hour before going to the lecture.The lecture was such a treat, and without realizing it, I was gradually goinginto a similar state to the one I had first felt when I went into the circle in1996 at Stonehenge, the one called the Julia Set. I had no recollectionafterward of what Lucy actually said.When the lecture was over, without thinking, I got up from my wheelchair (whichhad been left in the passageway outside the lecture hall) and, forgetting thatit wasn’t just an ordinary chair and that I needed it, walked across the lecturehall to speak to Lucy. When I reached her, I realized what had happened. I wasin no pain but my muscles started to feel weak. However, I was so delighted andwas able to stand and chat to Lucy for quite a few minutes (normally I can’tstand long enough to even brush my teeth).I turned to walk back to my wheelchair, as I was beginning to feel rather weak,but still no pain. I felt as though a miracle had happened. Unfortunately thebeautiful experience didn’t last very long, and by the middle of the night I wasin acute pain again, which lasted several weeks.Despite the physical pain, my mood continued to feel radiant and at peace withthe world and more able to tolerate my disability.Many times I went into crop circles during the 1990s, and in early 2000 I wentin on crutches and came out carrying my crutches above my head.I have known Paddy Lyons since the 1990s and have witnessed the progression anddeterioration of her condition and her determination and courage in trying hervery best to continue visiting the crop circles against all odds and in severepain. She loved flying over the circles as well as visiting them.The above report is testimony of her courage. It was a humbling experiencetaking down her words as she dictated them in a factual, accepting, anduncomplaining manner in the face of great adversity and pain.Relating to the October 2016 Petersfield lecture event, I was astounded to findPaddy standing waiting to talk to me after my lecture, no wheelchair, andstanding as straight as a die. Her daughter, on the other hand, was dartingaround in a panic, thinking her mother was going collapse or fall at any moment.We talked for some time and Paddy confirmed that over 90 percent of the pain hadgone. After a few minutes, she walked back across the large lecture hall, stillstraight-backed and walking like any normal person, and out of the hall. I stoodquite still for some time afterward, trying to take in what I had justwitnessed.Paddy told me that she is due to have a shoulder replacement that will makegetting around on her crutches even more difficult. Also as one of her ankles isbeyond having a replacement, she is going to be having an L-shaped metal rodinserted in her foot and leg, immobilizing her ankle permanently but relievingthe pain. Some people might question the sense of having all these seeminglyendless and ghastly operations, but if you suffer the degree of pain that PaddyLyons endures, to be rid of the acute pain is paramount on her agenda.It is interesting to note that she had no remembrance of what I had talked aboutin my lecture, especially my report of how certain circles affected people tothe extent that the frequencies emanating from them could be healing. Oneparticular circle is not necessarily universally beneficial as we each respondto crop circles on a personal level. A circle that may be beneficial to oneperson may not have the same effect on others.Another interesting point is that Paddy’s symptoms seemed to worsen after theapparent temporary healing. This unfortunately has been reported on severaloccasions. To date we have no satisfactory medical explanation for thesereports. The research continues.A WONDERFUL GIFTMy final story is a happy one that may or may not be a result of a crop circlevisit. Jennifer Denning, a watercolor artist, who kindly sent me this report, isfirmly of the opinion that her cure is a result of her visit to the MayanCalendar formation that appeared on the crest of the slope opposite Silbury Hillin August 2004.The week before I had been given a picture taken from a newspaper of an enormouscrop formation . . . which could not be seen from the road, but only after youhad climbed up for about a quarter of a mile, to the crest of a large field. Andthere it was!! What a marvelous awe-inspiring image, which for my son and myselfhas proved to be both a revelation and vibration-raising experience—and Ibelieve was the start of the experiences to come later.image [images/9781620558683_030.jpg]Fig. 4 4. Mayan Calendar, Silbury Hill, near Beckhampton, Wiltshire, August 3,2004.There was a downside to our visit to this formation. We both experiencedheadaches on the way home and felt extremely tired. I fell asleep easily, butwas awoken at 1:00 a.m. with terrible pains down the left side of my body. Itfelt as if my body was contorted with cramps, and the pain in my left thigh drewmy leg backward and upward quite violently and then spread downward to my leftfoot and upward into the groin and hip area. The pain was intense andcontinuous, and nothing I did helped to alleviate it. I could not move from thebed, and then a rigor set in, my teeth were chattering, and I shookuncontrollably for about ten minutes. Just as my husband was about to dial 999,it stopped—as suddenly as a light switch being turned off. The next day I felttotally drained, exhausted, and nauseous, but not bruised in any way as oneusually does from cramps.I called my son, Jonathan, about 11:00 a.m., and he told me that he hadexperienced a bad night also, with lots of joint pain, but fortunately not sosevere, and that both the children were fine.One of the most amazing things after this experience was the wonderful feelingof well-being and contentment that gradually spread through my being, and theensuing happiness, which is still with me.The most amazing thing is that I have also experienced a spontaneous healing ofthe eye problem that I had been suffering from. Macular degeneration had beendiagnosed after I started having vision problems in late 2003.*4[9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft4] Vision from my right eye was difficult, as I haddistorted vision with all straight lines appearing wavy. This made readingdifficult, and I was told on my last visit to the specialist in the autumn thatit was progressive and I would probably need an operation. I was offered anoperation at the Heath Hospital in Cardiff, which could take place beforeChristmas. After considering the verdict something made me ask if I could delaythis and make another decision in January 2005 when I had my next appointment.This was agreed to reluctantly by the eye specialist, with instructions that ifmy sight worsened I was to come back to the hospital immediately.However, one morning in early October I looked out the bedroom window thinkingwhat a lovely day it was, and then suddenly realized that my eyesight wasnormal! No wavy lines! What a wonderful gift.February 2005: Since writing this I have seen my eye specialist at the RoyalGlamorgan Hospital, and he could see for himself the improvement in my vision.He said that he was surprised and that medically I was “a great rarity.” Proof,if more were needed, that something happened that day in Wiltshire.Further note, June 2005: I had an eye test with my usual optician and she toldme that my reading vision had also improved.In July 2005 I again attended the Crop Circle Symposium, which is when I spoketo you, Lucy, and showed you the photos of the beautiful orbs that have beenappearing in my photos, and also spoke about the healing of my eye problem.You asked me to contact you after seeing the eye specialist in September, hencethis letter. I have my appointment letter if you wish to see it.September 2005: I have seen an eye specialist again at the RGH, and once againhe could not account for the improvement in my sight. The next appointment willnow be in eight months’ time, which, he said, is just to monitor the situation.My sight is still fine, and every day I am aware of the wonderful gift that Ihave been given.I hope my experience will prove useful to you in your research, I do stronglybelieve that the energy held in these formations can be transformational.COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]Crop circles, just like every scenario in the Cosmos, are defined in terms ofwaves. Just as we see ripples on a pond or ocean waves, these waves can beeither stationary or moving as on water.Waves are defined by two parameters. The first is the wavelength, that is, thelength of one complete cycle, which is defined by one up and one down motion.The second parameter is the frequency of the wave. This is the number of cycleswe observe usually in one second. Thus we are all used to tuning in to TV andradio programs. Each such program covers a band of frequencies, the wholespectrum being termed a channel.In everyday life, we mostly experience light waves, which our eyes clearly tunein to. The rainbow demonstrates the different combination of colors to whichdifferent cone structures in our eyes are tuned.However, when we refer to other waves such as sound, then the frequenciesinvolved are far lower than light. Indeed the band of frequencies varies from afew cycles per second, which we perceive as rumbles, up to around 20 kHz(thousands of cycles per second). The ability to hear this top frequencyregrettably reduces with age.Now, sound waves possess a totally different structure from light waves. Whereasthe latter are essentially electric in nature, they combine with an associatedmagnetic wave to create, not surprisingly, electromagnetic waves. They areindeed the structure of light, which possesses a maximum speed. Sound waves areall to do with longitudinal waves, that is, waves that oscillate back and forth.The clearest way to grasp the difference between these two forms of wave motionis to envisage a Slinky toy. The electromagnetic wave is akin to shaking theSlinky up and down, whereas pulling it like a concertina generates sound waves.Whereas the former is purely electrical in nature and operates in a vacuum,sound waves require the medium of air to travel through. No air, no sound waves.image [images/9781620558683_031.jpg]Fig. 4.5. The Slinky.There is one rather unique type of wave that is not even well known inmainstream science. This is the so-called torsion wave. If we consider a Slinkytoy again, then the motion is a twisting one. This oscillating rotationalmovement is key to virtually all long-distance cosmic connectivity.Light takes a little over eight minutes to reach Earth from the Sun. This ispathetically slow for communication even to our outer Solar System. Torsionwaves travel at a speed that is 1039 times faster. These types of electric wavesare key to intergalactic communication. They are termed Birkeland currents andwere first found over a hundred years ago. Everyone is familiar with them,usually unbeknown to us, since in acoustic form, they are the sounds generatedby all bowed instruments such as violins, cellos, and so forth. The bow twiststhe string, which vibrates in a twisting motion.Why do frequencies occur in crop circles? Every pattern is in fact made up ofsignals of differing frequencies. We are all used to looking at newspapers, TVs,and computer screens. These images are in fact nothing but a matrix of dots,which these days are mostly colored as per rainbows. However, in Earth Energypatterns, it is usual to find the waves, which create the images, are primarilyrepresented during crop circle creation as waves surrounding energy structures.The primary shape is that of a ring. The creation process is like a smokerblowing smoke rings. These rings, to use the technical term, are toroids. Thetoroid and the sphere are the fundamental topological structures of space. ThePlatonic solids are fundamental geometrical forms derived from the twotopological structures—e.g., a cube nested within a sphere. They are subsets ofthe two topological structures.image [images/9781620558683_032.jpg]Fig. 4.6. The torus.Now imagine our Slinky toy being joined at its ends, thus creating a ring butclearly having wave structures around it. This form occurs everywhere in theCosmos. As described in more detail in the appendices, this energy form“emerges” from the earth where a crop circle is formed. These bubble rings riseto the surface and are created from electric strikes to underground watersources. Like bubbles in water, they rise to the surface, and on breakingthrough, just as soap bubbles pop, so do these wave rings of energy. Thecollapsing bubble with its significantly lower pressure inside than outside“sucks down” the crop in a very controlled manner. The result for such a simpleform is clearly a circle.Thus, in essence, a crop circle is a “frozen-in-time” wave. The size of thecircle depends on the depth from which it is generated and the angle of thecone, which dictates how the cone size grows in moving to the surface. It turnsout that the frequencies involved in the creation process are very low, of theorder at most of a few cycles per second, not unlike earthquakes. The wavevelocity again is low, of the order of a few feet per second. This process hasbeen observed by those lucky enough to see one forming.By contrast, the electrical phenomena involved are often directly visible in theform of both spiraling columns of energy, akin to a vertical Slinky-toy wavemotion. In addition, small balls of light are sometimes seen moving along theenergy lines associated with the basic grid layout of the formation. Plasmaphenomena are not always visible, since in addition to the glow mode associatedwith plasmas, there are also arc modes and indeed dark modes, the most commonform in Earth Energy activities. The triggering force is electrical in nature,but its strikes to Earth release what are essentially acoustic waves fromunderground water. Pattern formation is a repeated version of this fundamentalprocess.As indicated, we have to differentiate between the frequencies involved bymeasurement either of the pattern-wave structure, readily undertaken with tapemeasures, or by using meters of various kinds. Crop circles can create ambientwaves, which are retained within the creation electrical double layer, whichforms the overall energy hemisphere. These can be detected though not alwaysmeasured, using electrostatic detection meters. As there are many types on themarket, it is not always straightforward to detect, measure, and classify suchelectrostatic fields. This task is often undertaken at stone circles wheresimilar energy fields are far more stable and columnar vortices are detectableat nodal points on the Earth-grid system."},{"pageContent":"5CROP CIRCLE GEOMETRY AND MUSICThe mathematician’s patterns, like the painter’s or the poet’s, must bebeautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words, must fit together in aharmonious way.GODFREY HAROLD HARDY, FRS (1877–1947)OCCASIONALLY, PERMANENT HEALING occurs as a result of visiting crop circles,but, as we discussed earlier, the majority of reports fall into the list ofnegative effects; crop circle visitors automatically expect to feel well andtherefore are surprised and dismayed when the opposite occurs.However, whereas the greater numbers of healing events are unfortunately onlytemporary in nature, they are still worth discussing in order to illustrate theeffects of the inherent residual “energies” at the sites and their subsequentimpact on living systems, even from a distance.Pythagoras was the first to recognize that music and numbers were linked, and aswe look at images of crop circles we will notice that many are shaped likemandalas. As all genuine crop circles are based on geometry, the geometricfigures are emitting frequencies just as Pythagoras described, thus stimulatingour brains and resulting in various different mental or physical reactions.Mandalas are the schematic representations of the Cosmos in Buddhist, NativeAmerican, and other traditions. Seen as universal symbols, they were used by ourancient forebears to induce meditative and trancelike states. Just as a musicalchord can activate resonances in the ear and the brain, which kindle emotions,mandalas can also affect people who view them. This effect is known as a “signstimulus,” and it triggers a behavioral response without requiring knowledge orunderstanding on the part of the person. All mandalas contain certain essentialgeometric principles, such as number, form, and ratio; many are based onPlatonic solids and are rooted in sacred geometry.Sacred geometry teaches us that buildings containing these geometric principlesand proportions are more harmonious and remedial. Our ancient cathedrals allobserve and are true to this fundamental geometry, and if this idea were carriedforward to our schools and hospitals, I feel certain the benefits would berecognized and more widely implemented.On one occasion I was giving a talk in New York and the hall was filling up butnot everyone was seated; a girl arrived and rebuked me for starting late. Ismiled at her and said that I hoped she would receive what she needed from mytalk. Afterward she came up to me transformed. She apologized for being rude andexplained that she had had a long-term painful knee and that during my talk thepain had completely disappeared. Unfortunately I did not get her contact detailsso was unable to follow up her case.Many people are extremely sensitive to these transmitted energies; some peoplefind that they are unable to look at pictures of certain formations, whileothers feel nausea or appear to fall asleep.On another occasion I was giving an early morning talk at the Harry EdwardsHealing Centre in Surrey. During the talk not only was a strange ticking soundheard by many (there was no clock in the room, the central heating was not on,nor were there any workmen around), but a couple of people, much to theirchagrin, fell asleep during the talk. “I have never fallen asleep so early inthe morning,” said one.After the talk we sat outside and chatted about many things including theticking, and I heard one of the slumberers say, “O yes, I remember that.” I hadobserved her sleeping at that particular time! It seems that whereas the personappears to all intents and purposes to be asleep, they are only in an induced“mandala” trancelike state and can indeed hear everything!THE HARPMay 2009 was a glorious month. The Sun shone and circles appeared—one clearlydepicting a musical instrument. Therefore I was delighted to receive an emailfrom Dr. Karen Ralls, a medieval historian at the University of Edinburgh, and alongtime music researcher into the history of ancient and wooden flutes.image [images/9781620558683_033.jpg]Fig. 5.1. The Harp at Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, May 25, 2009. An elaborateformation consisting of a center circle with two large and two small arcsextended and connected by circles of decreasing size. Once again seems to followthe yin yang theme.A postgraduate student had mentioned my website to Dr. Ralls, suggesting thatshe might like to have a look at the Windmill Hill Harp imagery, and thesymbolism regarding the number seven, in general.In her email Dr. Ralls explained,Regarding the number seven, the overall situation is rather complex, butfascinating. It is a theme many have explored over the years in a variety ofways.It seems that at the very beginning (i.e., in the West), among the objectscreated by pre-Greek inhabitants of the Aegean area in general, the earliestknown stringed instrument is the harp.In fact, last night I was learning more about the early visual depictions of atleast seven small marble figures of seated harpists that belong to the periodbetween about 2700 and 2100 BCE. These were discovered on islands in theCyclades—Keros, Thera, and Naxos.The instruments tend to be referred to by earlier musicologists as the “Cycladicharps”—but the precise language or culture of these people is still littleknown. However, in time, more information will probably come to light fromarchaeologists.Some of the archaeologists believe that (as the figures were pre-Greek), theymay possibly have come from west Anatolia (modern Turkey) and then into theAegean/Greek areas.Since these marble figures don’t show the exact number of strings or how theywere plucked, etc., it cannot be known how many strings there were for sure.There is a general lack of sources from about 2000 to 1500 BCE, and it is not atpresent certain exactly what cultural contacts there were between these earlyCycladic people and the Greek-speaking people who began to arrive in the Aegeanarea after 2000 BCE.Of course, as more research from many fields comes to light in the future, theoverall picture will become much clearer.In addition, I found that on counting the smaller circles on the outside of theharp there were 19. The number 19 has been found in stone circles in the BritishIsles and is thought to relate to the nineteen-year Metonic cycle.Meton was a Greek mathematician and astronomer who lived in Athens in the fifthcentury BCE. Meton found that nineteen solar years are almost equal to 235 lunarmonths and 6940 days. The nineteen-year Metonic lunisolar calendar was namedafter him.THE DECIMAL, THE FRACTION, AND THE OGHAM ALPHABETIn 2008 a truly remarkable event occurred on June 1. A curious signatureappeared in one of the fields lying beneath the famous Barbury Castle Iron AgeHill Fort in Wroughton on the northern edge of the Wiltshire Downs. It isthought that the Barbury Castle site was first occupied going back some 2,500years, and at that time was in use during the Roman occupation of the area.Archaeological investigations at Barbury have shown evidence of a number ofbuildings indicating a village or military garrison located there. Once thebattleground of the Saxons against the Britons in 556 CE, it rightfully boastsfantastic views over the surrounding countryside.image [images/9781620558683_034.jpg]Fig. 5 2. Barbury Castle, Wroughton, Wiltshire, June 1, 2008.The crop circle was undoubtedly the pick of the season, covering some twelveacres. Flying over it shortly after it appeared it seemed an unusual series ofratchets and circles within a circular frame. Posting my images on the internet,I received an email from retired astrophysicist Mike Reed who had seen my imageson Linda Moulton Howe’s excellent website (www.earthfiles.com[http://www.earthfiles.com]).Reed has impeccable references, having worked at the University of Arizona inTucson on the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) at Mount Hopkins, a joint venturewith the Harvard Smithsonian Observatory. He told me,I noticed the Barbury Castle pattern posted on the Earthfiles site yesterday. Itis apparently a coded image representing the first ten digits of Pi (the ratioof the circumference of a circle to the diameter). The tenth digit has even beencorrectly rounded up. The little dot near the center is the decimal point.The attached diagram [Mike Reed kindly allowed me to make the diagram slightlyclearer, and Andreas Mueller then finished it professionally] shows the analysisthat reveals the code [see fig. 5.3 below]. It is based on ten angular segmentswith the radial jumps being the indicator of each segment. Starting at thecenter and counting the number of 1/10 segments in each section contained by thechange in radius clearly shows the values of the first ten digits in the valueof Pi.James Lyons commented,Pi = 3.141592654, to ten places rounded up. The actual value to twelve places is3.14159265358. You can see that the tenth digit has been rounded up from 3 to 4since the next digit is a 5.The three circles at the top to the right of the top four just under theperimeter are not circles, or spheres or ellipses; they are an ellipsis, thegeometric term for “and so on,” which exactly characterized Pi!Is there any evidence that this circle is man made? If not this is certainly aninteresting development.Longtime crop circle researcher Charles Mallett visited the formation on themorning after it had appeared and reported that there was no mud on the fallencrop. As it had rained that night his is an interesting comment, for when thesoil is wet just walking down a tramline leaves us with soil building up on thesoles of our shoes until it feels as though we are walking on stilts. It wouldhave been humanly impossible to construct a formation in those conditionswithout leaving any trace of mud; indeed, I have been into several formationsover the years in which the flattened crop has been covered in mud, which wouldsuggest they were human made.Not content with giving us a circle with Pi in decimal form, the phenomenonproduced another earlier circle in fraction form. It was geometer MichaelGlickman who made this discovery: “Several formations had referred to 22/7.Perhaps the most significant of these was Picked Hill (sometimes referred to asWoodborough Hill) of August 13, 2000, which again used both 44 radial and 14concentric geometries [which divided by 2, gives us 22/7]. The brilliance ofthis exemplary crop circle is confirmed by the implicit heptagram, whichrestates the seven.” Geometer Michael Glickman writes thatimage [images/9781620558683_035.jpg]Fig. 5.3. A diagram of the Barbury Castle crop circle.traditionally the square has represented the world and material realty while thecircle has been the symbol of Heaven and Spirituality.In the 90s the circles started referring to squaring the circle. This symbolisesthe marriage of Earth and Heaven, a bridge between Man and Spirit, and thecircles, through their reiteration, seemed anxious to emphasize it.Pi is the arithmetical constant used in all calculations involving circles andcircularity. Pi might be read as a key to the door between circles and squares.Pi, in its purest state, is an irrational or infinite number whose digits extendinto many millions. It starts 3.141592 . . . and then continues foreverObviously this level of precision is rarely needed and so 22/7 (3.142857 . . .)has been adopted as a close enough and more practical substitute.image [images/9781620558683_036.jpg]Fig. 5.4. Woodborough Hill, Woodborough, Wiltshire, August 13, 2000.The beautiful Woodborough Hill formation of August 13, 2000, was an outstandingexample of 22/7. A circle can be divided in two ways: radially (that is dividedfrom the center like a pizza) and concentrically (like ripples on the surface ofwater after a stone has been thrown in). Woodborough, radially, had 44divisions. Were it a pizza, each of the forty four guests would have aludicrously thin wedge of 8.1818 . . .° while concentrically it displayed 14rings. Forty-four over fourteen is equal to 22/7 = Pi.As explained previously, we were taught at school that Pi or π is a mathematicalconstant that represents the ratio of any circle’s circumference to its diameterin Euclidean geometry, which is the same as the ratio of a circle’s area to thesquare of its radius. Pi is one of the most important mathematical constants:many formulae from mathematics, science, and engineering involve Pi.Surely there can be no clearer indication that we are dealing with anintelligence behind this phenomenon by producing formations showing us Pi inboth decimal and fraction form?Possibly one of the most teasing events of 2010 was the much-debated earlyformation at Wilton, Wiltshire, appearing beneath the famous windmill on May 22.image [images/9781620558683_037.jpg]Fig. 5 5. Wilton Windmill, near Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, May 22, 2010.image [images/9781620558683_038.jpg]Fig. 5.6. The Wilton Windmill formation showing the Euler equation anomalies.As with the earlier circles, it was in oilseed rape (canola). Some likened it tothe ancient Ogham alphabet thought to have been brought here by the Celts whooriginally migrated from Assyria to Mesopotamia (Iraq) before arriving in GreatBritain. Others preferred Russian-born physicist Leonhard Euler’s equation, but,after close examination, it was clear that several anomalies existed asillustrated by James Lyons’s excellent diagram, shown in figure 5.6, and hiscommentary just below. (Please refer to appendix 7[9781620558683_c18.xhtml#pg228], for more on the Wilton Windmill.)The small lines in the Wilton Windmill event resemble the Ogham alphabet whichis thought to be named after the Irish god Ogma. The origins of the alphabet areunknown but the generally accepted opinion is that it could have been used as asystem of tallies for accounting. Clearly only the inscriptions on stone remainas evidence, but it is likely that they were generally inscribed on sticks,stakes, or trees. We are told that the inscriptions would generally have takenthe form of somebody’s name and the name of a place and were probably used tomark boundaries.These anomalies drew Linda Moulton Howe’s attention to the German physicist MaxPlanck’s theory of the Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) and Standing-WaveInteractions (which occur at discrete frequencies f), which explains QuantumEnergy States of Matter and Light, “Quanta” (E = hf ).*5[9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft5]image [images/9781620558683_039.jpg]Fig. 5.7. The ancient Ogham alphabet.Another interesting discovery by James Lyons was the presence of the diatonicratio encoded in the design (white notes on the piano). Able to play it on hispiano he told me, “it was not very harmonious.” It was the late musicians PaulVigay and David Kingston who were the first to transform the crop circlegeometry into music with some quite remarkable results.Having woken at 4:00 a.m. one morning and unable to get back to sleep, I decidedto drive down to Wiltshire and see the formation for myself. It had been rainingheavily overnight and despite having stopped by the time I arrived, I hadforgotten how much water the yellow petals retain. The crop stood about fivefeet tall, and in no time at all I was drenched from head to toe, and myWellingtons were full of water that had trickled relentlessly downward off myclothes. In addition, I had forgotten to bring my aerial photograph, and sincethe formation could not be seen from the ground (only from the air or thewindmill and this had been closed the weekend the formation appeared), I simplycould not find it and was getting wetter and wetter. Not surprisingly, not manypeople were happy to answer my early-morning mobile telephone calls until JulianGibson nobly answered his and gave me the necessary directions. The outer ringwas much trampled and did not provide me with the information I needed. However,the lay of the crop was remarkable, lying in a crisscrossing herringbone manner.I made my way inward to areas that had been untouched and found what I waslooking for, an unbroken stem without any cracks above or below. Canola snaps ifbent an angle of 40 degrees; it also cracks and bruises very easily if anyweight is applied, which would indicate it was man made or that people hadpreviously visited the formation if several days old. That is why it isimportant to try to enter a circle almost as soon as it appears before anyphysical evidence is destroyed by visitors. In order to ascertain this properly,it is necessary to dig away the soil from some way down around the stem. Holdingmy camera with soil-covered, wet, and slippery hands, I managed to get aphotograph. Now soaked to the skin, and hoping that no one was around, I did aquick strip, discarding first my sweater, replacing it with a jacket that camedown to my knees and hid the fact that I had also discarded my jeans. Luckily Idid not have to stop for anything on my way home so modesty was preserved!Definitely worth the effort.image [images/9781620558683_040.jpg]Fig. 5.8. Above, undamaged canola plant stem. Below, root to undamaged canolaplant stem. Wilton Windmill, Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, May 22, 2010.image [images/9781620558683_041.jpg]COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]All animals, as we ourselves do, respond to vibrations of the air around them.In structured form we recognize the effect as music.It is well known that the style of the music is critical to where it is heard orplayed and its intended purpose. Thus, it is not surprising, say, to hear aSchubert quartet in an old people’s home, rather than a rock band. So what is itabout music that literally resonates with us?We know that, at best, we can only hear frequencies up to 20 kHz. This is waybelow bats, for example, who can hear to frequencies at least twice this value.Air motion, such as a breeze, is of course a daily experience, but there areseveral scenarios in which air moves in a coordinated fashion. Putting asidewind in general, we must note severe events such as hurricanes and more localphenomena such as dust devils, which are vortex columns of air.In crop circles, there are many events involving rotating columns of not onlyair but also embedded electrical phenomena. The frequencies of rotation arerelated to Earth-vibration effects. Of more immediate appearance are thepatterns of the formations themselves.It turns out that the underlying pattern of crop circles follows the grid ofenergy lines upon which, for example, medieval churches as well as ancient sitessuch as Stonehenge and Avebury were located. These so-called acupuncture pointson the Earth are colloquially termed “spiders’ webs” since in the UK theyusually comprise six rings with eight radial lines. They are located at thecrossover of telluric currents within the ground, the centerlines being locatedat the center of the formation.It is the vibration of the Earth currents that creates the patterns. Thisprocess is well known, and imitation formations can be created in a dish holdinga layer of sand. Sound generators not unlike loudspeakers below the dish, onbeing activated by specific frequencies cause the sand to move laterally tocongregate at the nodal points within the dish. By combining differentfrequencies, the collective harmonic pattern can produce an incredible varietyof shapes. We have noted that the basic creation mechanism of crop circles isfrom below via rising toroidal shapes. It is the modulation frequencies on thesetoroids that define basic patterns. A more detailed discussion of the diatonicscale can be found in appendix 7.Thus, summarizing the music-to-brain-wave connection we find in crop circles, wecan say with some confidence that brain frequencies align with naturalfrequencies in formation. What the ambient vibrational energy in the circles isdoing is totally analogous to an oboist tuning up an orchestra. Thus out-of-tunebrain waves are entrained to function at their intended frequencies. In otherwords, this is Mother Nature’s way of retuning the brain to its natural state.In specific formations, the multi-circle spiral formation, the Julia Set (1996),which took around thirty minutes to form, is perhaps the most forceful exampleof the harmonic sequence in operation. An eyewitness account of this event isfound in appendix 1 [9781620558683_c12.xhtml#c12s01.03].From a simple center circle, we see that the creating energy, initially risingas a simple toroidal form in the center, then rises to the shell energy dome andreturns back to Earth, this time not creating a circle but, seeing it isessentially a long tapering cone of spiraling energy, it reemerges, smaller insize in a differing predetermined location. This process is repeated, thuscreating the tapering arms, which slowly rotate each new circle to form thearms. Each individual circle in itself has a rotating ring from which smallerside circles are formed.Of all the formations that have been created since the early 1990s, this onemust qualify as the key teacher for demonstrating the underlying creationprocess. This reveals in particular three key facets of the crop circlephenomenon. 1. It highlights basics of simple circle creation from below. 2. It most clearly demonstrates the harmonic sequence involved. 3. Having been seen forming, it revealed to many not only the crop circle creation process but also the cosmic processes of Galaxy creation.From the health perspective, the separately tuned circles resonate with theneural structure of the brain and show how in principle crop circle energyyields the synergistic energy fields, which can realign or retune the humanbeing’s fundamental harmonic structure."},{"pageContent":"6TECHNICAL AND MECHANICAL FAILURESScience is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.IMMANUEL KANT (1724–1804)THE EVER-INCREASING USE OF, and exposure to, electrical equipment and electricalfields that are stronger than those that occur in the natural environment areinevitably causing a disturbing disruption to our well-being, and more seriousin-depth research is needed in this highly sensitive and controversial area. Theequipment that produce these fields include such items as microwave ovens,mobile telephones, computers, the internet, washing machines, refrigerators, airconditioners, electric blankets, televisions, hairdryers, and so forth. Theresults of these effects are playing an integral part in our daily existence; weare in fact bombarded with these higher frequencies every day of our lives, andthe consequences of these fields on our central nervous system must be an areaof concern.Paul Vigay was one of the first people to experience and record electricalanomalies. He found that, on numerous occasions, his mobile phone would not workwhen inside the circle but would operate perfectly when outside the circle. Hewould repeat this several times with exactly the same effect.He developed his first detection gizmo in 1990. He had been experimenting withsome electrical components, and the net result was Mark One, which was initiallydesigned to pick up weak electrical currents such as those coming from lightswitches and cables. I remember him demonstrating it along the walls in my houseand it seemed to work pretty well. I was most impressed!One day he was at his parents’ house. His mother, Mavis, had visited a cropcircle and had hung several bunches of wheat taken from the crop circle in thekitchen to dry. Paul had been idly playing around with his gadget when hedecided to test it against these bundles of wheat and was amazed at thedifferent signals he got. One bunch gave a very strong reading whereas the otherdidn’t.On asking Mavis about them he realized that it was the samples taken from insidethe crop circle that were giving the strong reading, while the others gave noreaction whatsoever. Whatever the “energy” is, it clearly can remain active forsome time after the event.HE HAD TO CHANGE HIS MINDStrange and unexpected events occur not only to humans and animals while insideor in the vicinity of crop circles but also to inanimate objects such as farmmachinery and electrical devices.I was doing a television interview in 1997 on a newly discovered circle at MilkHill in Wiltshire. The farmer and owner of the field, Brian Reid, joined us andall was going happily and smoothly until the program producer asked the farmerto harvest out the formation by driving his harvester through the center of thecircle so that they could capture this event on camera.I was horrified and protested loudly and vehemently—“it is like cutting thecenter piece out of the Mona Lisa; you can’t do that,” I cried. All to no avail:the farmer got into his harvester and clankety-clank, clankety-clank went themonstrous machine.I could not bear to watch; this was sacrilege, I turned my back on the scene andclosed my eyes. Closer and closer came the sound until—suddenly silence. Iturned round, and to my utter delight, the harvester had broken down.The toolbox was produced, spanners appeared, and sadly within minutes the faultwas mended and again with my back turned I could hear the dreadedclankety-clank, clankety-clank as it drew closer and closer until yetagain—sudden silence. Joy of joys, the harvester had broken down for the secondtime just before reaching the circle. What was happening? The farmer lookedbewildered.Out came the toolbox and more spanners and other gear flew around until theharvester reluctantly started, and before I knew it the center of the formationwas stripped bare. I was horrified by such desecration.It was only the following year when I bumped into Brian Reid that he came up tome and took me to one side. He confided that never before had his machineryfailed, and not just once but twice. He said that previously he had alwaysbelieved that all the circles were man made but had had to change his mind afterthis experience!image [images/9781620558683_042.jpg]Fig. 6.1. Milk Hill, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, August 7, 1997.The next sections are devoted to electrical anomalies where the number ofreports are so enormous that once more there is a need to be selective.THEY CAME BACK TO LIFEIt was a little too dark to take photos without a flash, but I thought I wouldtry anyway (I knew the battery in my camera was flat; it had been for sometime). I started to take photos and the flash worked. I looked at the batteryindicator at the top of my camera and it registered a full battery.Later that morning I met a friend, and we went to my local photographic shopwhere my batteries were certified dead. I bought replacements but retained myold ones. Returning home exhausted later that evening, I resolved that if I didnothing else before tumbling into bed, I must test my “dead” batteries. I putthem back in my cameras and, lo and behold, they were as strong as if they werenew. I have used them ever since!When we entered the Telegraph Hill formation that morning, a friend had laid hissecond camera (Nikon FM 5 volt, using FUJI Super G ASA 200) on the ground whilehe assembled his pole and took several shots of the formation.When he had finished he collected the Nikon that had been lying on the groundand walked up the tramline at the top of the formation. The light meter gloweddimly a few times and faded completely. The battery was dead. Fortunately he hadnot thrown out his old batteries and I suggested he should retain and test them.He rang me the following day to tell me that his defunct batteries had also comeback to life!Another visitor to the circle said, “I thought I would take a picture from thisformation looking up at the hill we had just sat on, but when I tried thecamera, which has an electronic ‘wind-on,’ I found there was no life in it atall, which was strange because it had been functioning perfectly prior to thismoment. It did not come back to life until I was back in the car.”2000Dr. Richard Boylan informs us that, when flying over a formation that hadappeared on August 14 in a field of wheat at the corner of 93 South and ChurchDrive, between Whitefish and Kalispell, Montana, the pilot noticed his compasssway 10 degrees. “I had just recharged my new eight-hour camcorder battery. Butafter taping for only twenty minutes, the battery was drained.”Research immunologist Dr. Roger Taylor sent this report:We were in a crop circle on Hackpen Hill, the first of August, with someAmerican friends. Their camera would not focus properly, so that they wereunable to take any pictures. On taking it to the shop, it turned out the battery(which had been almost new) was flat. After getting a new battery, they wereable to take pictures in other crop circles, but there was still a residualproblem with the autofocus.Roger has a very sensitive and advanced program using computerized Kirlianphotography, which sends a high-voltage discharge from his finger to theelectrode. He refused to take it into any crop formations for fear of costlyelectrical disturbance to the equipment.In the three-segmented formation at Liddington Castle a brand new camcorder withtwo new batteries had complete battery failure within two minutes.I had brought my Sony digital video camera and taped extensively, using specialeffects. At one point I laid my camera on the ground in the center of one of thesmall circles and immediately remembered Ron Russell telling me how he had donethe same one time and had damaged his camera. I snatched it up, but too late; myeight-hour $150 battery was dead, and I could not recharge it fully. It readstrangely on my equipment—“full” on the camera, but “three hours” on thecharger, no matter how long I left it to charge. I have two batteries and theother one, which was left in the room, was normal.1998A colleague from the Wiltshire Group relates how in 1998, when she did a radiointerview in the formation opposite Silbury Hill on Tuesday morning, May 5, forthe local station, the tape sped up so considerably that it appeared to stop.Being accustomed to electrical failures inside formations, she suggested theytake the tape machine outside the formation. At a distance of about fifty yardsfrom the formation the tape machine worked perfectly. They repeated this testseveral times with identical results. The interview was played over the radiowithout cutting the bizarre sound effects; it sounded like gobbledygook as thetape sped up. The interviewer, who had previously been a skeptic, was takenaback by these unexplained events, events that she has never experienced before;she is now convinced that this is a genuine phenomenon and wanted everyone tohear the strange recording!image [images/9781620558683_043.jpg]Fig. 6 2. Silbury Beltane Wheel, near Beckhampton, Wiltshire, May 4, 1998.This is not the end of the story. Later in the day, Western Television alsovisited the formation. They were even more skeptical, pooh-poohing the wholesubject and indicating that anyone who believed the formations were other thanman made were either stupid or gullible.My colleague longed for something strange to occur and wished her very deepestwish that some anomaly would convince them otherwise, but as the time wore onand nothing untoward had happened, she was despondent but resigned. That eveningthe pictures were shown on the local television with brief reporter coverage.The next morning a member of the television technical crew telephoned to saythat the reason the reported coverage had been so short was because their soundsystem had been so disrupted that most of the recording was unusable. He simplycould not understand this; their sound equipment was of the very highest qualityand the most reliable available, designed to cope with any situation. It hadnever failed before!A man who visited the 2007 formation called the Druids’ Knot, Alton Priors, onthe first morning took four camera batteries with him. Three were newly chargedrechargeable batteries; the fourth was a completely new non-rechargeablebattery. To his dismay he was only able to take four pictures as one by one thebatteries drained as soon as he put them into his camera.I visited this formation with meteorologist Alan Day the morning it appeared. Hewas keen to help me bury my bottles. I was walking ahead of him and suddenlyheard him say “Oh no!” followed a few seconds later by “Oh damn!” Turning aroundI found him gazing in fury at his camera. He had only shot five or six frameswhen the camera went forward two frames and then within seconds whizzed thewhole way back into the canister, taking the tab with it.image [images/9781620558683_044.jpg]Fig. 6 3. The Druids’ Knot, Alton Priors, Wiltshire, July 22, 2002.A few days later I did an interview with an Italian TV company. I happened tomention this incident to the cameraman whose eyes lit up as I related the story;his camera had failed in the exact same spot. It had never happened to himbefore. Fortunately it recovered when he moved off to another area of theformation.Camera and mobile-telephone failures are almost too numerous to mention.However, this anomaly can be extremely annoying especially when flying, and whenthe camera fails just as one has eventually managed to get the formationperfectly within the frame.Crop circles have often been the plague of my life, as I have lost count of thenumber of times when I have had the perfect image in the frame and was justabout to take the picture, when, lo and behold, the camera button would notdepress—or even worse, one time the whole image seemed to be cut in two, only tofind that when f lying away from the circle, the camera functioned perfectly. Wewould return to the circle and the same glitch would occur. We repeated itseveral more times only to give up in the end. Grrrr!Camera malfunctions have happened to me on many occasions, but this oneparticular time, when f lying over the newly formed three-sided scallopedformation containing nested crescents at the Sanctuary, was especially irksome.The clouds had momentarily disappeared, and I had clear sunlit visibility andperfect positioning. All to no avail, my camera containing slide film would notfocus. Try as I might by putting it on every conceivable setting, it stillrefused to focus. Yet another broken camera!In my frustration, I felt like tossing it into the beyond. However, good senseprevailed and we set off to photograph another formation using my other camerawith print film. On our return I happened to pick up the rogue camera and lo andbehold it focused perfectly.I KNEW MY BATTERY WAS FULLY CHARGEDReports of mechanical and battery failures abound. Valerie Charlton visited theWansdyke in Wiltshire on August 26, 2001, to see the Milk Hill formation when itwas two weeks old. She reported:I have a Canon UC9 Hi8 Camcorder, which I have used for the past four years,without it ever failing to work. I have two available batteries, one large(Duracell DR12, 6V), which will easily last for three hours of filming, and asmaller one that lasts about half an hour. I charged up the large batteryovernight and put it on the camera before leaving Midhurst to drive to Wiltshireat about 11:00 a.m. I did not take the smaller one (Canon battery pack, BP-711,6V, 1100mAh Ni-Cd battery) with me, knowing I was unlikely to film for more thanthree hours.As I walked up the formation on the track I took out the camera meaning to filmthe wonderful view of the land dropping away to the right of Milk Hill, thinkingit would describe the landscape in which the crop circle had occurred. Thecamera would not work no matter what I did. I tried taking the battery off thecamera several times in case it hadn’t engaged properly. The red light on thecamera would not function.I was very irritated and disappointed, but, because I knew the battery was fullycharged I just thought that my camera must have been damaged, it didn’t occur tome at the time that the crop circle might have drained my battery.When I got home I put in the smaller battery and the camera worked perfectly. Ithen put the bigger battery on charge overnight and in the morning it alsoworked perfectly. It is now eleven days later, and the big battery is stillcharged and the camera working perfectly.image [images/9781620558683_045.jpg]Figs. 6.4 and 6.5. Milk Hill, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, August 14, 2001 (The JawDropper). A very impressive six armed Julia set design, which spans over tentramlines.THE JAW DROPPERAs a final note to this formation I include a message I received from the CircleMakers, John Lunberg, Rod Dickinson and Will Russell, who aptly christened theformation the “Jaw Dropper.”Here’s something to ponder. If this formation was man made, allowing for time toget into and out of the field under cover of darkness, the construction timeleft should be around four hours.Given that there are over 400 circles, some of which span approx. 70 feet indiameter, that would mean that one of those circles would need to be createdevery 30 seconds, and that’s not even allowing any time for the surveying,purely flattening. This formation pushes the envelope and that’s a MASSIVEunderstatement . . . my brain hurts!Whereas I do not approve of many of their activities, I was delighted to receivethis email and their commendable acknowledgement that the “Jaw Dropper” wasbeyond the wit of man.Not only did this formation appear during a rainy night, but on inspection thefollowing day, it revealed no traces of mud on the flattened crop such as wouldhave been clearly visible had people walked down the muddy tramlines toconstruct it. In addition, the ground was deeply rutted yet the formation showedno jagged edges to the many circles. It lay on the highest point in Wiltshire,the Wansdyke.MOBILE PHONESSo frequent are mobile-telephone failures that when one fails it comes as nosurprise. “I did try my mobile phone in the circle and got a message sayingthere was no signal, but that wasn’t particularly unusual.”On another occasion, on reaching the center of the formation, to my amazement,my switched-off mobile telephone rang in my pocket. I switched it off again andexplorer John Blashford Snell, one of the party, said, “Switch it on again andring the number back.” I did as instructed and on the display board it read,“Number unavailable”!My mobile then (again switched off) started making strange noises, and when Ipicked it up, it was ringing the same person whom it rang yesterday. I didn’thave any numbers in the address book in the phone, so it just picked up a numberpreviously rung.In contrast, a crop circle visitor recalls that he had used his mobile phone theprevious Friday at which time it registered half full; on leaving the cropcircle formation it was fully charged!In the 080808 Alton Barnes formation a visitor using her mobile telephone onentering the formation found that it cut out inside the circle but workedperfectly on leaving.image [images/9781620558683_046.jpg]Fig. 6 6. 080808, below Milk Hill, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, August 8, 2008.I’m afraid the Sugar Hill formation has been the death knell of my idiosyncraticmobile! Visited the formation late yesterday morning (August 4). Wanted to ringa friend to say it was worth a visit, but could only get a minimal signal—tookphone down tramline, and no signal at all, so decided it was because the fieldwas in a dip. But the signal has never returned—tried in various places all theway home; once got a message on the screen saying “Access Denied” but apart fromthat nothing. Battery OK, just no signal. Boosted battery when I got back, butnothing doing! Will take mobile into the shop sometime and see what they say,and will let you know.An addendum from three days later:Quite extraordinary—switched the mobile on several times yesterday to check forsignal. Nothing. Same again this morning. Met friend for lunch and was tellingher the story of its demise, switched it on, and suddenly a faint signal, butdidn’t last long enough to make a call. Same again ten minutes later. But halfan hour later, full signal and full service resumed. So it had been out ofaction for about forty-eight hours, and now seems back to normal—though whethernormal is normal or its own version remains to be seen!CREDIT CARDS AND KEYSIn 1999, after leaving the Hackpen formation, Christopher Weeks discovered thatthe three bank and credit cards he had brought with him into the formation nolonger worked. They had been wiped clean. This would indicate the presence of anoscillating electromagnetic field or, according to Rodney Hale, even a simpledirect current (DC) field would achieve this result, which is why we should notplace our credit cards near fridge magnets.Christopher Bean and his friend Linda also had problems in this circle: “I alsonoticed that my credit cards and bank cards now do not work after taking mywallet into that formation. I only take a few credit cards and bank cards withme when I go out with Linda to the fields so that I can travel light; in thiscase the ones I’d left behind are fine, but I have had new cards from Royal Bankof Scotland and Barclays (and I am waiting for a new MBNA card).”Boots, the pharmacy, has a warning sign reminding customers not to put theirdebit or credit cards near a certain area of the cash register as the magneticfield can damage them.image [images/9781620558683_047.jpg]Fig. 6 7. Hackpen, near Broad Hinton, Wiltshire, July 3, 1999.James Lyons suggests that for this to happen the electromagnetic field would beturbulent and oscillating at approximately 1,000 cycles per second.A visitor from abroad found that after visiting the 070707 formation (fig. 6.8,below) in East Field, Alton Barnes, the hotel card to her room had also beenwiped clean.A woman who took her remote keyless car-entry device into this same East Fieldformation (070707) found, on her return to her car, that her device had beencompletely wiped, and it was now unusable! The information can be erased orreset when exposed to strong ultraviolet light of a certain wavelength, whilstthe flash RAM can be cleared or scrambled with an electrical charge. Thecontroller chip would need a significant electrical charge to disruptoperations, along the lines of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP).Another report came from Sally Ann Mudge who, after visiting a circle, felt verydisoriented and even tried to get into the wrong car. When the keys did not fitshe thought the formation had interfered with her keys before she realized hererror. She felt completely disoriented and feared for her sanity.image [images/9781620558683_048.jpg]Fig. 6.8. 070707, East Field, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, July 7, 2007.On another occasion, Henrik Lovdokken and his wife joined me for a private-entryvisit to Stonehenge. He reported:However, coming back to our hotel, both of our credit-card-size magnetic hotelkeys did not work. It looks like they had been exposed to some magnetic fieldsfrom the crop circle visits, causing them to be demagnetized. Demagnetizationcould happen if it is near a cell phone, but mine was in my wallet all the timeand my wife did not carry a cell phone.CHURCH BELLSOn the night the Double Helix circle appeared (June 17, 1996) in East Field,Alton Barnes, shortly before midnight, a couple living close by heard churchbells ringing from the direction of Avebury. They made enquiries and were toldthe bells were not rung on Sundays and certainly not at midnight. They met anold woman in Avebury who had also heard them ringing that night. The bells arenot electronically operated; they are rung mechanically. We know that theelectromagnetic field caused by UFOs can cause electrical disturbances, but howwere the bells mechanically activated on that night of the New Moon in June?image [images/9781620558683_049.jpg]Fig. 6 9. Double Helix, East Field, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, June 17, 1996.Heather, another visitor, later went into Devizes and was surprised that herpedometer had registered a higher distance walked than expected. “Then Irealized that it had altered itself to kilometers. This could not have been doneaccidentally as one has to hold down the button firmly for five seconds to altersettings.”COMPUTERDuring our scientific research day at the Druids’ Knot formation (fig. 6.3[9781620558683_c06.xhtml#pg85],) in 2002, Dr. Roger Taylor was anxious about thesafety of his laptop computer (owing to the numerous electrical failures thathave occurred over the years inside crop circles). He wanted to monitor voltagepulses while inside the formation, so he took his computer in. With him waschartered electrical engineer Rodney Hale, who had adapted a Psion 3A handheldcomputer to record and graph the rates of any voltages pulses.All was quiet until 1620 hours (4:20 pm) and then a few minutes later a spikeoccurred, lasting approximately six minutes (see fig. 6.10 below).I telephoned Taylor the next day to inquire about the results and was astoundedto learn that since leaving the formation his laptop computer had become uselessto the point that it would be necessary to replace the system board. Would theresults still be there on the hard disk when repaired? Could the six-minutespike recorded on Rodney Hale’s Psion handheld computer be held responsible forthe damage? Several weeks later, and at a cost of £610 ($800), the computer wasrestored and yes, his results were still there.image [images/9781620558683_050.jpg]Fig. 6.10. A spike in voltage recorded at the Druids’ Knot, July 28, 2002.So what could be the cause of the anomalies? Clearly the exact location on theEarth’s grid-line pattern—essential for the formation of crop circles—isimportant, as many areas are especially electrically active. Crossover points ofenergy lines generate columnar vortices, which are rising spiraling columns ofelectrical charge. This is a natural consequence of the strong electrostaticpotential associated with the Earth-ionosphere electric field. In recent years,equipment capable of measuring these effects has become available.One word of warning I believe is important. If people have an electrical healthdevice, such as a pacemaker, I would advise them not to enter a crop circleunless they have consulted their doctor.COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]Why do crop circles have such a wide range of effects on so many different itemsof electrical equipment?The energy of crop circles is spiraling electric charge. In this respect theenergy spirals like a tornado, which reveals its electric origin as filamentarystructures rising vertically. This is the basis of crop circle generation. Inaddition, within crop circles, there are far narrower yet similar structuresemerging from the Earth’s grid-line structures at nodal points. We measure thesewith special electrostatic meters.However, if a laptop, for example, were to be located on such a spot, it wouldencounter a rotational electric field, which generates magnetic patterns onappropriate structures such as computer-processing electronics. These can oftenlead to totally scrambled signal structures, which clearly can, at a minimum,distort information but often can so disturb results as to be useless. It isalmost impossible to anticipate such effects. The initial testing for suchlocations permits avoidance of such places. These effects often result inheadaches for observers in these places.There are many investigators of such phenomena. In the early days of the currentoutbreak of the crop circle phenomenon, many American visitors used standardelectrical-energy recording devices with dramatically differing results.However, research colleagues from Russia are well versed in subtle-energyresearch and utilized quite specific test equipment. The whole topic of thesubtle-energy domain is within mainstream physics, and as such the crop circlescenario is of great interest. In contrast to this more scientific approach,there are many visitors who generally possess, quite naturally, a sensitiveresponse to these rather uniquely structured fields of energy. They representthe majority of crop circle visitors.The future of the crop circle phenomenon is likely to grow significantly, sinceinterest in the topic of an Electrical Universe is growing dramatically.Generally speaking, gravity is no longer thought to be the key organizingfeature in cosmology. Rather electricity, seen as propagated in spiralfilaments, is rising to prominence as an important factor. The dramatic changeswithin our own Solar System, even within the period of recorded history, are atlong last being recognized. Archaeological sites such as the Bosnian Pyramid ofthe Sun with its man-made tunnels have been dated by the British Museum to34,000 years BCE. The now-recorded columnar vortices rising from its peakresemble the structure of many crop circles. All told, the coherence of manyapparently differing phenomena on Earth have a common underlying energystructure. This is leading to a new perspective of the Cosmos and our placewithin it.We can now say bye-bye to Big Bang and its offspring, Dark Energy and DarkMatter. Such bizarre concepts are being replaced by evidence for the ElectricalUniverse. It is not without significance that the crop circle phenomenon hasmade, and continues to make, a contribution to this world-changing perspectiveabout the Cosmos. We are at last uniting ancient and modern science with life ingeneral, and mankind in particular is playing a significant role in this wholeremarkable process."},{"pageContent":"7ANIMAL REACTIONSYou have noticed that everything an Indian does is in a circle, and that isbecause the Power of the World always works in circles, and everything tries tobe round. . . . The Sky is round, and I have heard that the Earth is round likea ball, and so are all the stars. The wind, in its greatest power, whirls. Birdsmake their nest in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours. . . . Eventhe seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back again towhere they were. The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, andso it is in everything where power moves.BLACK ELK (OGLALA) (1863–1950)NO MATTER HOW DISMISSIVE SKEPTICS may be about the volume of human andelectrical anomalies, animal reactions and behavior are more difficult if notimpossible to ignore, and so their behavior is critical to research into cropcircles.We know from the effects on pilots’ instruments that there is a vertical fieldof “energy” that extends to an unknown height above a crop circle; therefore itcomes as no surprise that birds are affected. “Whilst sitting enjoying the foodand the view of the stones of Avebury, a wood pigeon flew across the field froman easterly direction. Just outside the formation it seemed to almost hit awall, making it veer suddenly, around the formation, to the north (it didn’toverfly it at all) and then it continued to fly to the west after its detour.”Exactly the same effect was recorded in Canada when a skein of geese veeredsharply away from flying over a formation, only to regroup directly afterwardand continue on their way. Birds have magnetite in their brains and react tomagnetic fields.image [images/9781620558683_051.jpg]Fig. 7.1. Electromagnetic spectrum.More sinister were the remains of exploded birds found in the Wanborough cropcircle in July 1994. On careful examination it seemed that a bird had explodedin the center of the circle. Christopher Weeks and I found an area measuring ina thirteen- to fourteen-foot radius from the center, covered in blood, tinyfeathers, and minute bits of flesh, not just on the surface but penetratingevery layer right to ground level. There were no bones or any distinguishableparts of the bird, and the “mess” was totally different in appearance from thepile of feathers in the outer ring, clearly once belonging to a pigeon andclearly killed by a fox. We sent samples to a biologist in Devon who reportedthat indeed it would appear that a bird had “exploded” and that it was dead atthe time of the explosion. I had found empty cartridge cases in the field, andit was clear that the pigeon had been shot and was lying there and haddisintegrated when the crop circle force hit the ground.Another report on the darker side spoke ofthe strangest and most chilling thing I have ever seen was the body of ahedgehog which appeared to have been completely drained of body fluids—as if ithad been freeze-dried. I grew up in the country, so have seen lots of deadwildlife, but never have I seen anything like this. It was on the path into theformation at Avebury Trusloe, June/July 1991. There appeared to be no externalinjuries, but it looked almost flat.image [images/9781620558683_052.jpg]Fig. 7.2. Wanborough, near Guildford, Surrey, July 1994.image [images/9781620558683_053.jpg]Fig. 7.3. Wanborough, near Guildford, Surrey.image [images/9781620558683_054.jpg]Fig. 7.4. Remains of a dead bird within the Wanborough circle, July 1994.The friend who was with me at the time was used to picking up roadkill for afriend of his who is a taxidermist, but he had seen nothing like this. I wouldhave taken it away but my friend was adamant that it was not going in his car!This report is similar to the dehydrated and flattened porcupines that werefound in a crop circle in Canada in 1992. The dehydrated corpses showed no signsof injury or decomposition and did not smell. Animals can sense danger, but bothhedgehogs and porcupines rely on their quills to protect them and thereforeremain stationary instead of fleeing. In these cases we seem to be dealing withthe microwave, infrared area of the electromagnetic spectrum, suggesting thatthese animals were indeed “microwaved.”CHARACTER CHANGESome normally docile creatures seem to behave in uncharacteristic ways whenexposed to samples of crops from the formations. Doreen Jenkinson had taken homesome wheat from inside a newly formed crop circle, and as soon as she got homeher customarily sweet and gentle cat started growling at her in a low tone asDoreen touched the wheat. “I normally hang the wheat up but because of my cat’sreaction I left it in the lavatory. My cat sat ‘guarding’ it for two days. Afterone day I went to touch the wheat and got the same reaction from her, glaring atme to say ‘No, don’t touch.’ By the second day this reaction disappeared.”My gray cat, Hero, became obsessed with some stalks of barley from a crop eventthat I put under the dining room table. He sat there sucking the ears of thebarley and growled at me when I tried to remove him. He would sit by the diningroom door, dashing in to resume the “sucking” each time I opened the door. Ialso noticed that his character was changing, and he was becoming aggressive. Hewas a beautiful big gray cat, and I loved him so much.Alarm bells started ringing, however, when one time I went into the dining roomfor something and refused to let him in. I bent down to stroke him as I came outand he suddenly stood up on his hind legs and almost raked my face with hisclaws. I realized that something was desperately wrong, and despite alltreatments, including homeopathic remedies, his day-to-day aggression increasedto the point that he became a serious danger to me, and sadly I had to have himput down, which nearly broke my heart.It all started after he sucked the barley stalks. Had there been some chemicalreaction from sucking the stalks? Was it due to various crop sprays used by thefarmers?HE IS THE CAT’S WHISKERSIn early July, I took a party of people from London into the bewitchinglybeautiful South Field “Cathedral” formation.I had given them a talk in the morning, and before I started was surprised to begreeted by a stranger, accompanied by a cat in a British Airways bag slung overher shoulder. The woman asked after my cat, Hero. How did she know about Hero?Of course, I had mentioned him in my book, and Rupert, the Burmese blue, washere to experience the circles for himself.It was one of those days when every type of weather condition was practicing itsskills with the greatest of enthusiasm and gusto. One moment, the Sun would peekits nose through briefly only to be shouldered out by the clouds, the bringersof rain—rain of every sort and description from a drizzle to torrentialdownpours accompanied by thunder and lightning. It seemed that we had toexperience the whole bacchanalian menu of conditions. How were these towniesgoing to survive this wanton display by the elements? They were magnificent:many of them had never been into a crop formation before, and many of them werestrangers to the countryside. For them the whole scenario turned into a magical,mystical event as we stood in the formation surrounded by the ancient hillsterraced by our ancestors of long ago, the nipple on the breast of Adam’s Gravestanding out proudly, reminding us of our connection with Gaia.What about Rupert? If an animal could talk then surely he would be the first; hewas a most sagacious beast and apparently accompanied his owner nearlyeverywhere. He was attached to a very long leather lead giving him maximumindependence. His owner Mary Spain writes:image [images/9781620558683_055.jpg]Fig. 7.5. Mary Spain and Rupert the cat, 2000.The most interesting aspect of Rupert’s reactions was that he behaved exactly ashe does when visiting a church—he has visited numerous country churches on ourtravels. He was respectful, quiet, alert, and very interested. When on a countrywalk he is far more boisterous. Another interesting thing was that, uninvited,he went up to a stranger sitting meditating and sat down beside her. Although heis always perfectly polite to strangers, he is not normally friendly to thisextent and has never sat on anyone’s lap but mine.It may be coincidence, but Rupert’s constipation problems were sorted out afterthe experience!An intriguing end to this story came to my notice. Mary Spain wrote telling methat five days after visiting the formation, she went to have her hair cut.My hairdresser couldn’t understand the amount of static in my hair until Iexplained that it had been full of energy since I visited a crop circle at theweekend. She grew very excited saying that only that morning she had seen abeautiful picture of a crop circle in the Daily Mail and had read of Rupert’sexperiences.HORSE SENSEA beautiful Daisy Chain formation in barley was discovered at Cheriton, nearCheesefoot Head, Hampshire, on July 6, 1997. The surrounding twenty-nine circlesaround the flattened center each contained a central tuft of standing crop;diagonally across the center of the formation were two “Magimix blades”consisting of minute and perfect circles.An American researcher was the first to discover and visit the formation. Shehad neglected to ask the farmer’s permission and, as she was standing in thecircle, the farmer’s wife came riding down the tramlines toward her. As thewoman got nearer she rode toward the unfortunate researcher in an aggressivemanner, but the moment her horse reached the edge of the circle it stopped, anddespite several cracks of the whip, refused to budge, becoming quite agitated.This clearly added to the rider’s annoyance, and she shouted, “I do not believein these %#@& circles!”image [images/9781620558683_056.jpg]Fig. 7.6. Daisy Chain at Cheriton, near Cheesefoot Head, Hampshire, July 4,1997.“Maybe you don’t, but your horse certainly does!” replied the researcher.In that year, one of my first visits was to the “Bear’s Paw” near Morested,Hampshire, which appeared in early May in barley. A rider was trotting her grayhorse along the path dividing the field in two. I managed to catch her beforeshe disappeared out of sight and asked her if she would mind riding her horseinto the formation.She was happy to do so, saying she was fascinated by the crop circles and hadtaken her horse into several. She felt he was a good judge of the circle’sauthenticity. Her horse displayed no visible sign of agitation, moving aroundthe formation and standing still when reined in. The rider however remarked thathis breathing rate had noticeably increased.What made a Rottweiler rushing ahead of its owner into a crop circle suddenlystop dead, roll over, and fall asleep just before it reached a terrified womansitting meditating in the center?Equally strange was the behavior of two normally friendly Labradors, as shownwhen they attacked each other and then a woman inside a formation.What conclusion can we reach, if any? Can we ascribe this varied and bizarrebehavior to certain frequencies in the electromagnetic field, or could we bedealing with the effects of crop spraying?I suspect that the young wheat in that field had already had a potent mix of awhole range of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides sprayed upon it, with alot more to go.I really feel that people should look on the website of various organizations tofind out more about these symptoms. I know there is a couple working at theUniversity of Iowa on agricultural chemical poisoning. We should remember thatmost spray applications are what are called “tank mixes” where, to save time andmoney, farmers mix several sprays at once, often up to four different brands.This can cause a little-understood range of chemical interactions.I am now beginning to believe that many of the experiences people record withinthese fields are directly related to chemical poisoning, and anyone going into afield would be well advised to check with the farmer what his spraying regimehad been. I know that, speaking personally, I will not be entering anothercircle unless I have first checked with the farmer about when the field was lastsprayed.COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]So far, our consideration of ambient energy within crop circles has, notsurprisingly, focused on humans. However, as we have already observed, we mustat least consider the circles’ interaction with other living species.Here we’ll focus on two creatures: dogs, who on many occasions have accompaniedtheir owners into crop circles, and birds, which, of course, are more likely tooverfly formations and yet are still susceptible to the specific ambient energyfields.Since these creatures possess similar consciousness-related cell structures ashumans, we need to assess what similarities and differences relate to behavior.As with all living creatures, it is the structure of the brain that mainlyaccounts for the observed effects. With regard to humans, we need to considerbrain frequency and energy-detection processes. Concentrating on the latter,which has so far received little attention, there is one common feature,including among humans, which can be clearly identified as the key element ofenergy detection.We assume that the eyes are the major information-detection system, but sightclearly depends on light waves within a relatively narrow frequency spectrum,namely, the colors of the rainbow. Yet a completely separate system is needed todetect and process information when we consider the ambient waves within a cropcircle. These waves are the spiraling waves of electric charge, which dominatethe structure of the Cosmos.We mentioned above that these are called torsion waves, as per our Slinky model;these waves can be detected by what in early Yogic philosophy was called theThird Eye, which is connected to the pineal gland, so called because of itspinecone-shaped structure. The gland is in essence made of quartz and hence is,as all Healers know, electrically active.It operates in a completely different way from the eyes, which use frequenciesfar higher than the fundamental resonance frequency of quartz. The frequency ofquartz is 28 kHz, a little above the hearing limit of humans. This frequency hasrecently been identified in the columnar vortex rising from the Bosnian Pyramidof the Sun. It is also the frequency used in low-voltage health zappers thatinteract at the cellular level. The third eye is the detector of all thespiraling waves we find in not only crop circles but all ancient sites.Dogs have a higher frequency-response range than humans and are aware of theEarth vibrations. Depending on the spectrum of these frequencies, a dog willbehave in differing ways. As young people devour the frequencies of rock music,older folk mostly prefer Vivaldi!It is the bird scenario that is perhaps even more fascinating. For around 150years, people have thought that birds navigate by detecting the Earth’s magneticfield, especially magnetic north. To date, despite enormous effort, no one hasfound any sign of such a feature that could possibly be used for navigation.However, a completely new model is emerging based on the use of the pineal glandas the key detector of the key frequency of the Earth, which is identifiable atmany locations on our planet. Like the Bosnian pyramid and crop circles, as wellas ancient sites and medieval churches, there is a columnar vortex of energygenerated at points on the Earth’s energy grid that provides an enormousdirectional signal like a lighthouse.There have been many situations in which flocks of birds flying toward ancientsites or crop circles split into two groups, each flying around the column andjoining up again once past it. They have no problem detecting the spiralingenergy via their pineal systems. Work continues on how pineal glands link viathe hypothalamus to the brain to reveal and analyze the emitted columnarvortex—the perfect navigation system.Additionally, a pineal gland can act like an accelerometer as well as a rategyro, the two key building blocks of an inertial navigation system. Perhaps themost revealing aspect of this new hypothesis is that the subtle energy fieldaround the pineal gland reduces sharply to zero when its axis is pointing atmagnetic north.Thus we see that crop circle energies, created initially by rising toroidalwaveforms that rise from underground water, when breaking through the Earth’ssurface, form a vacuum space to draw down the crop. This leaves a spiralingcolumnar vortex in which we find a whole spectrum of frequencies, mostly withinthe frequency band compatible with the detection systems of humans, animals, andbirds. It is therefore of no surprise that reactions to these signals areperfectly normal. The frequencies involved can generate both good and badresponses, dependent on the health condition of the human or animal.To conclude this section, it is worth noting that it is at long last possible topurchase Radionic Healing units. These are quite old in concept, butcomputerized equipment now enables such units, via handheld probes, to analyzethe frequency response of a complete patient.As an orchestral conductor tunes up his players prior to a concert, modernradionics units analyze each organ of the body, for example, the heart or lungs,to see how out of tune a patient is. With such a “map” it becomes possible toretune that organ to its correct operating frequency. No pharmaceuticals areneeded. Such units are now being evaluated in the NHS, and large-scaleimplementation of the technology is envisaged."},{"pageContent":"8SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL TESTINGTime comes from the future, which does not yet exist, into the present, whichhas no duration, and goes into the past, which has ceased to exist.SAINT AUGUSTINE (354–430)AS I NOTED IN THE PROLOGUE, after my own personal healing experience in 1990, Irealized that there must be many other people experiencing similar effects, and,in order to try and explore what was happening, I drew up a rudimentary firstquestionnaire to give to those visiting crop circles. I was amazed by the hugeresponse.Little did I realize what a wealth of material I would accumulate over the yearsas a result of that remarkable day in July 1990, and I now have the largestdatabase in the world relating to crop circle effects with an impressivecollection of over eight hundred reports. These were not reports of randomexperiences; there were too many strange and varied personal events to ignore.I am of the opinion that we are, as indeed are all living things, composed of“energies.” These energies ebb and flow depending on a number of things, forexample, our emotional and physical well-being. These energies extend to varyingdegrees beyond our actual physical bodies. I wonder how many of you understandwhy you react the way you do if you are in close proximity to another person?Your energy fields (or aura) are in fact overlapping, and you will find that youare on the same wavelength (vibrations or energies) as that person, to a greateror lesser degree, having the possibility of varying from one extreme to theother. Hence you may register abhorrence, dislike, being vaguely uneasy,neutrality—right through to total compatibility.How often we put on a façade in order to appear as we think others would like tosee us; we are all chameleons, and in order to survive and adapt we so oftendisguise our true self. However, from those who can feel or see the energy forcethere can be no concealment. They will be able to know intuitively the physicaland emotional well-being of each individual. So it is with all living things;even leather and wood breathe. The Earth is a mighty energy force of acomplexity not comprehended by many. For the Earth’s responses are controlled bymany interacting and interdependent conditions, among them the other planetaryinfluences being forces of great importance. Remember, the planet is a living,breathing organism, which we with great temerity would try and harness for ourown greedy benefit.Now for the crop circle energies: where these involve ley lines, and indeed itwould seem that this is the case with all (apart from the hoaxed ones), theenergies present are powerful. Thus the reactions of individuals will relate totheir own personal energies. Some may be unpleasant, others extremely harmoniousand beneficial. In all events it is a very personal experience, and I have seena number of people come quietly out of a circle with a look of awe and humility:a far cry from the persons they were when they went in! It is also important topoint out that should you feel in any way uncomfortable, you should leave asquickly as possible. There is no point in persisting, and indeed it could beharmful. Experiences have varied from healing to headaches!Whereas the skeptical may, with a certain amount of justification, dismiss outof hand the results of the human-effects reports as coming from people withoveractive imaginations, it is more difficult to dismiss the evidence ofrigorously conducted scientific tests. To be fair, I cannot dismiss the numberof reports I have received from people who have taken the trouble to fill in andreturn the questionnaires. I believe the majority are sober-minded, levelheadedpeople. I realize it can be a time-consuming and lengthy procedure filling outforms, but they are of the utmost importance, and are written with such amazingdescriptive clarity and vividness, as if the contributors have painted a picturewith words. There can be absolutely no doubt that these experiences were real,and people’s sincerity and amazement at what had happened to them were beyondany reasonable question. Indeed I know from my own personal experience thatthere are many varied “energies” in the circles that can affect peopleindividually. Once you have had a personal experience there is absolutely nodoubt in your mind that something out of the ordinary has happened to you forwhich you can find no other logical explanation no matter how hard you try.THE PLACEBO EFFECTAt this point I must make clear that it has been suggested that a placebo effectcould be involved in the healing process of people visiting the crop circles orindeed watching them on screen. This is a perfectly valid assumption and onethat needs to be addressed.What is a placebo effect? Used medically, it is a process of testing theeffectiveness of a treatment in which a proportion of the people being testedare given the actual medical treatment and the rest are given a visuallyidentical treatment but one that is designed to have no effect over a givenlength of time. If some of the people who are not given the real medicaltreatment feel better, this is put down to the placebo effect.When people visit a crop circle the general presumption is that they are goingto feel well or even feel better as a result. If we look at the other side ofthe coin, you will be surprised to find that this is frequently not the case anddefies all their strongly held expectations. Considering that I have a databaseof over eight hundred reports, it seems unlikely that so many people could allbe suffering from delusion or overactive imaginations when sometimes they haveexperienced really quite intense disagreeable effects, as well as beneficialones on other occasions. It is interesting to note the amazement andbewilderment experienced by people to these contrary and unpleasant effects.Many regular visitors now realize that the effects of visiting a crop circlecannot be prejudged, as the effects are felt on such an individual basis; oneperson might be sitting in a crop circle feeling wonderful, whereas the personsitting beside them feels ill. This seems to be dependent on the many aspectsinvolved in the mental, physical, and emotional well-being of each person.The same reactions may be found with only visual exposure. Photographs shown ina book or on the screen are emitting frequencies with the same negative results,some of which are so extreme to the point that some people have had to leave theslide lecture or stop reading the book because they have felt so ill. On theflip side, ailments and illnesses can be healed. Again, I stress that we aredealing with individuals, and so the effects will of necessity be varied andmultiple.It has also been proposed that “suggestion” could play a large part in anyscientific test, that being wired up with electrodes plus the expectation ofbenefit and so forth could indeed induce people to believe that they will “feel”better. Therefore it is particularly interesting to note that there was oneinteresting set of scientific research conducted at Avebury Trusloe nearWindmill Hill, Wiltshire, in 2006. We were particularly excited as the circlehad appeared that very morning and so was fresh. However, the results weredisappointing, with little or no apparent change between the control tests takenat Avebury, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, and identical tests taken inside thenewly formed crop circle. I was later reliably informed that this circle hadbeen man made. We had indeed unintentionally conducted a most useful andinstructive set of double-blind tests.THE MEMORY OF WATERBack to people’s reports of their experiences in crop circles: What are these“energies” that they describe? With so many reports coming in, clearly I neededto try and find an answer to what these energies were and what was happening topeople who experienced them.I am on a tremendous learning curve, investigating areas not previously studied.This could only be regarded as enormously exciting; not only in scientific termsbut in making me aware that there is an ocean of knowledge and wisdom stilleluding us. This knowledge is inherent in Nature itself, and it is to Nature, atits most profound and spiritual level, that we needed to look for the answers.My first idea (much to the derision of my peers!) was to bury small bottles ofwater inside a crop circle and compare them with bottles of water taken from thesame source but buried outside the circle. I had long held the belief that, aswater possessed unique qualities, if anything might possibly register ameasureable change when in contact within a crop circle, as opposed to outside,it would be water. These have been analyzed over the years using differenttechniques, and the results have been quite remarkable. Water has a uniquequality to it, and despite great strides in medicine, physics, chemistry, andbiology, water and its behavior still remains largely a mystery. I believed thatif anything was going to reveal what was happening in the crop circles, it wouldbe water.We are told (in an article by Robert Matthews) that whereas most substances aredenser in their solid form than when they are liquid, water is less dense. Mostsubstances shrink when cool, yet frozen water expands, taking up more space thanthe original liquid.The boiling point, melting point, and heat-conducting abilities of water are farhigher than other substances, and it takes more energy to boil a pint of waterthan any other liquid.An average adult body is 50 to 60 percent water; that is roughly equivalent to45 quarts. Men are more watery than women. A man’s body is 60 to 65 percentwater, compared to 50 to 60 percent for a woman. In infants, the figure is awhopping 70 percent, according to statistics compiled by the InternationalBottled Water Association.About 70 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered in water, and the oceans holdabout 97 percent of all the Earth’s water yet more that 95 percent of theunderwater world remains unexplored. But water also exists in the air as vapor,in rivers and lakes, and in icecaps and glaciers.Over a period of many years, the bottles I buried were sent to many laboratoriesand were tested using different techniques. The results of the tests wereastounding, not only in their consistency but in the way the water responded tobeing buried inside the circles as compared to the control samples outside.Since 1992 I have been burying bottles of water in crop circles using thefollowing procedure. Following Dr. Cyril Smith’s advice, I used Volvic water asbeing the most constant water, not going above 4 Hz. Control samples are buriedfirst outside the formation and the others inside. When collecting the bottles,the ones inside are collected first and the control samples second, in orderthat the control samples are never influenced by the “energies” inside thecircle. I carry a notebook with me to give me an indication of where the bottleshave been buried, but as many people often trample the circle, the basic groundlay of the fallen crop may have altered the result so we turn to dowsing inorder to find and retrieve the bottles. Over many years we have found over 95percent. The bottles are labeled and numbered and written up in my notebook as Ibury them, then wrapped in silver kitchen paper, placed in an egg box, and sentto a laboratory to be tested blind. I am the only person who knows which numberrelates to each bottle and its buried whereabouts.In the July 2010 Vernham Dean formation the following water results were ofinterest. Christopher Weeks and I buried bottles of Volvic water inside thecircle in different areas. The further out toward the edge the worse I felt andeventually said “I have got to get out.” My head ached, I felt nauseous,disoriented, and generally drained. However we both managed to bury the oneremaining bottle before hurriedly making our exit. We had buried the controlsamples at the edge of the field before entering the formation, thereby insuringthey didn’t come into contact with any of the formation “energies.”On retrieving the bottles some ten days later we experienced none of thesesymptoms. This is something to which we have become accustomed, as the morepeople visit a circle, the more they seem to soak up and absorb the “residual”original force.The controls were bottles 273, 274, double control sample 275. A fascinatingfactor is that the Yara tests for trace minerals revealed an increase inammonia. There is no ammonia present in a bottle of Volvic water! What washappening? James Lyons kindly supplied a solution. Ammonia is a compound ofnitrogen N and hydrogen H with the formula NH3.The first thing to notice is the correlation between the nitrate and ammoniaresults. It seems as there is some breakdown of water into its constituentparts, namely hydrogen and oxygen. These molecules then attach to free nitrogenatoms creating both increased nitrate NO3 and ammonia NH4. This is aninteresting finding!image [images/9781620558683_057.jpg]Fig. 8.1. Nitrate levels.THE PARKINSON’S QUESTIONOne remarkable event was the spur to the next area of investigation. It came ina report from a friend of mine, suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Shedesperately wanted to visit a crop circle to see if it could possibly help her.I was reluctant to agree to this in case her condition was exacerbated. However,due to her persistence, I agreed to try and find a circle as nearly 100 percentbeneficial as possible. To this end I spent almost a week visiting the “TorusKnot” crop circle that appeared at Alton Priors, Wiltshire, on July 11, 1997. Itconsisted of a central circle with twelve large interlocking rings around it,similar to a Spirograph pattern, and was approximately 300 feet in diameter. Notonly did I go into the circle many times during that week but I also stood bythe edge of the field in order to talk to the people as they came out and thuscollected many reports, all of which were beneficial. Could this be the circlefor my friend? I insisted that it had to be entirely at her own risk andresponsibility. A few days later she entered the circle with a friend andexperienced a temporary but wonderful physical respite from the exhausting andcontinuous shaking after sitting in the center for about twenty minutes.Subsequently she did not shake for twenty-four hours. The physical relief wasenormous during that period, as was the amazing feeling of well-being that wentalong with the physical respite.image [images/9781620558683_058.jpg]Fig. 8.2. Three views of the Torus Knot crop circle that appeared at AltonPriors, Wiltshire, July 11, 1997.What was the reason for this extraordinary event? Since Parkinson’s disease is aresult of a chemical imbalance in the brain, clearly this should be where oursearch should be directed, and thus began a new quest involving research intothe activity of the brain and the endocrine system.As mentioned in chapter 2 [9781620558683_c02.xhtml#p27], a teasing thoughtarises when one thinks about consciousness. Is it a part of the brain or anindependent entity? It has been suggested that consciousness may not begenerated by the brain but rather “transceived” by it*6[9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft6]—that is, that consciousness may be a fundamental“nonlocal” property of all dimensions of the Universe, and that rather thanbeing an “epiphenomenon of brain activity,” it may instead be that the brainacts as an interface that allows consciousness to manifest “locally” on thematerial plane. I feel comfortable with this idea.However, our research was limited not only by the type of tests we could conductbut also by the techniques and methodology available. We have not been able toconduct blood tests on people before they go into a circle, while they areinside the circle, and later as a double control test. This would have enabledus to investigate the strange acid/metallic taste that I and others haveexperienced when visiting a circle. The taste is so pervasive; one is unable toget rid of it until it suddenly disappears as soon as one leaves the circle.This could indicate a sudden drop in blood-sugar level and a draining of energy.As noted in chapter 4 [9781620558683_c04.xhtml#p47], a lady after a talk came upto me and said, “I have got that taste now, and I am not in a crop circle!” Shewas a diet-maintained diabetic and knew that as soon as her protein ketones werebreaking down, she got this taste in her mouth. Could this be what is happeningto people when they visit certain formations? This was exciting yet frustratingdue to our research constraints.THE ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC DAYSAs the years went by we continued to get consistent results that demonstratedchanges in hormones (endocrine system) and other related areas including EEG(electroencephalogram) tests, but, frustratingly, no real progress was beingmade that would explain the temporary relief of Parkinson’s, and I was on thebrink of giving up—that is, until one day in July 2010 when conducting theannual scientific research investigations in a crop circle at Fosbury, nearVernham Dean, lying on the borders of Hampshire and Wiltshire. The circleconsisted of a central cube surrounded by angled Russian doll–type squaresinside an outer hexagon, and it had appeared just a few days previously.VERNHAM DEAN 2010Using the Asyra technique, acclaimed by William Tiller, professor of materialsscience and engineering at Stanford University, as one of the most reliablediagnostic systems available, Hazel Drummond reported:This year I carried out a test especially for the crop-circle research day. Ittested for disturbances/imbalances in the endocrine system, neurotransmitters,brain-wave patterns, chakras, vertebral misalignments, electrolyte disturbances,geopathic stress, harmful energies, and meridian disturbance.The baseline test, which covers all of the main organs/systems, was also run.In the results we are primarily looking for patterns of results that are out ofthe ordinary. For instance, in a standard group of eleven people being testedfor any particular disturbance we may well see two or maybe three showing asimilar disturbance, but usually it would be none or maybe one. Therefore morethan three is significant. The results are then collated.image [images/9781620558683_059.jpg]Fig. 8.3. Russian doll–type squares found at the crop circle at Vernham Dean,Fosbury, Hampshire, July 17, 2010.image [images/9781620558683_060.jpg]Crop circle research day at the Avebury Study Centre, Wiltshire.image [images/9781620558683_060a.jpg]Collecting data inside the crop circle at Vernham Dean, Fosbury, Hampshire.image [images/9781620558683_060b.jpg]Fig. 8.4. Control tests in the field outside the circle, Vernham Dean, Fosbury,Hampshire, July 2010.The first control tests were conducted at the Avebury Study Centre between 10:00a.m. and midday. For this year’s crop-circle research day we had elevensubjects, including myself; there were seven males and four females.The same tests were then repeated in the crop circle between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00p.m. Further identical control tests were conducted at the edge of the fieldbordering the lane after visiting the circle.I was then able to compare the results to see if there were any significantchanges in the three sets of results. As well as comparing the three sets oftests I also compared the results from tests of ten random people. This was thefirst time that we had tested for unusual activity with brain-wave patterns.When this test is usually run we might see that none of the patterns come up asimbalanced, or one or two out of eleven may have a particular brain-wave patternimbalance. I was quite surprised to see the patterns that emerged, althoughagain I am not sure of what the meaning may be.Six people in the circle showed gamma-wave activity (a very high frequencybetween 32–74 Hz per second).THE MISSING LINKCould there be a link to Parkinson’s disease? After reading copious articles onthe internet, I stumbled on a short paragraph in one that said that the brainnaturally produces dopamine in the gamma level of brain activity. This wasexciting; as it appears that in the higher frequencies of both beta and gammamore dopamine is released. Could this discovery be the longed-for breakthroughafter so many years of backbreaking and seemingly unrewarding research thatappeared to be getting us nowhere fast?Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter (messenger) in the brain.Further research told me that beta is the frequency range between approximately13 and 30 Hz and gamma is between approximately 31 and 74 Hz (see fig. 8.5below). Because of the filtering properties of the skull and scalp, gammarhythms can only be recorded from electrocorticography or possibly withmagnetoencephalography. Gamma rhythms are thought to represent binding ofdifferent populations of neurons together into a network for the purpose ofcarrying out a certain cognitive or motor function.image [images/9781620558683_061.jpg]Fig. 8.5. The relationship between frequency ranges and state of mind.Gamma brain waves are considered the brain’s optimal frequency of functioning.They are commonly associated with increased levels of brain functioning. Theyare also associated with a conscious awareness of reality and increased mentalabilities. As mentioned above, gamma brain waves range from the frequency of 38Hz to 74 Hz per second and have tiny (virtually unnoticeable) amplitude. Gammabrain waves can be found in virtually every part of the brain. They also serveas a binding mechanism between all parts of the brain and help to improve memoryand perception.Dopamine is classified as a catecholamine (a class of molecules that serve asneurotransmitters and hormones). It is a monoamine (a compound containingnitrogen formed from ammonia by replacement of one or more of the hydrogen atomsby hydrocarbon radicals). Dopamine is a precursor (forerunner) of adrenaline anda closely related molecule, noradrenaline. Dopamine is formed by thedecarboxylation (removal of a carboxyl group) from dopa.Dopa is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, which is often thought tobe associated with low levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain.Could my friend, who stopped shaking for twenty-four hours after sitting in theTorus Knot formation in 1997, have experienced a sudden burst of gamma-levelbrain activity resulting in a release of dopa? At long last we were starting tomake longed-for progress in understanding this elusive phenomenon.The following year I got in touch with a neuroscientist at Leicester University.He was intrigued by our findings, as he was finding that by increasing the levelof brain activity of Parkinson’s sufferers to the gamma level, it inhibitedtheir dyskinesia, that is, it stopped their shaking. However, his research wasfunded by the Welcome Trust, among others, and owing to the adverse presscoverage the crop circle phenomenon receives in the United Kingdom, he wasunable to work with us in furthering our research. However, to know that we wereon the right track was good enough for me, and that at long last the years ofstruggling to find a possible solution might be starting to bear fruit.BARBURY CASTLE 2011The crop circle research day procedure starts at Avebury Study Centre, nearMarlborough, Wiltshire, where we conduct the first control tests. We thenproceed to the selected crop circle, repeating the tests, and finally we moveout of the circle to a point some distance away and conduct the second controltest. These tests are then compared and analyzed.In 2011 we conducted our research in a formation lying below the famous Iron Agehill fort at Barbury Castle in Wroughton, Wiltshire.David Greenwood wrote the following report:image [images/9781620558683_062.jpg]Fig. 8 6. Barbury Castle, Wroughton, Wiltshire, July 2, 2011.image [images/9781620558683_063.jpg]Fig. 8.7. Barbury Castle, Wroughton, Wiltshire, July 2, 2011.As I approached the crop formation after walking down the track I had thechronic pain in my left lower leg and foot and fatigue, which are the mainsymptoms that have manifested in me for at least six years now. When I enteredthe formation I began to walk with the flow of the laid crop and close to thewall of standing crop wondering what intelligence had given the instruction tochange from broad to narrow and form the arms of a spiral shape. My awareness ofself soon disappeared as I began to enjoy walking the laid path. When I spotteda small depression in the crop I followed the tramline out of the main formationtoward the depression. It was at the point when I walked toward the depressionthat I felt something like a blast of static electricity. It affected my facewhen both sides of my face felt in compression. The hairs on my neck and armswere prickly. I stopped by the depression and my immediate thought was that itwas a nest of some kind. With the stalks crossed in the center I thought itmight be a signature or just a sign meant to convey impudence “Work me out! Whoam I?” or “I stopped here and left, and this is my tail end.” At that point Iwalked back into the main formation and continued to follow the wall of the cropround until I saw the second and larger nest (satellite). I did not enter thisformation because a lady was busy dowsing in the formation. After I had walkedthe whole of the formation I definitely had a feeling of well-being but noticedthat a slight tremor had returned to my left hand. I knelt down in the vortex ofthe formation and asked my subconscious to tell me the truth—it revealed to methat the formation was astral and a hologram with height and depth meant toconvey “As above, so below.”As I left the formation I was quite energized and walking briskly. My attentionwas drawn to a building called the Science Centre, and I wondered if there mightbe a connection with the formations. At the end of the visit I was convinced andstill am that this formation had been produced by something spinning thatproduced the static electricity. Certainly it was not a board-and-stringformation.In response to my further questions he kindly replied,To answer your questions: The tremor stopped after I had entered the cropformation and had walked approximately 30 meters on the laid crop in thedirection it had been laid. A slight tremor in my hand returned after I hadfinished walking the formation.LIDDINGTON 2012Since that memorable day in the Vernham Dean formation in 2010 our research hascontinued with equally exciting and consistent results. Also joining us in 2011was Paul Gerry, a highly specialized clinical physiologist from the Devon andExeter Hospital. As the technology improves, so the extent of our research andmethodology is widening and expanding each year. Each year we take in volunteerParkinson’s sufferers; also sufferers of Essential Tremor, a condition oftenlinked, but not necessarily so, to Parkinson’s disease.David Greenwood had volunteered to be my Parkinson’s guinea pig in 2011 withremarkable results. He had enjoyed the day so much that he re-volunteered tocome in 2012. However, at the last moment, his wife fell ill and, as he isunable to drive, he had to abandon joining us.In 2012, the chosen circle was at Liddington, just off the busy M4 motorway, acomplex multidimensional design of overlapping and interacting triangles withinan outer-ringed circle measuring about 80 feet diameter.Luckily Gill Puttick, who runs the Petersfield Parkinson’s help group, gallantlystepped forward to replace Greenwood. Other participants included EssentialTremor sufferer Linda Daubney, former senior reporter of the Petersfield Heraldand a longtime friend and supporter of my work.image [images/9781620558683_064.jpg]Fig. 8.8. Liddington, Wiltshire, July 1, 2012.It was a wet day, and we all donned Wellington boots and made our way down thetramlines into the crop circle.Paul Gerry conducted his tests using a clinical thirty-four-channel EEG machine.As the tests took one hour to set up and record and thirty minutes to remove theglue from the subject’s head, only two people were tested, a Parkinson’ssufferer and Ann Godden (with restless leg syndrome). Paul Gerry reported:The equipment records all frequencies up to the “sampling rate,” which is set at256 cycles per second. Then it can digitally filter out any below and abovespecific values: for example, 0.5–70 Hz is used clinically. I can see the mainproblem is that an EEG, even when performed on a relaxed subject lying down,still contains a fair amount of muscle artifact, which is high frequency(20-plus Hz).The technique was as follows: Each subject was recorded from disc electrodesplaced according to the 10–20 system, impedances kept below 5 Kohm, glued to thescalp with collodion.An EEG of fifteen minutes was recorded before in a crop circle and outside (butwithin the wheat field) shortly afterward. Each recording included periods ofeye opening and eye closure.image [images/9781620558683_065.jpg]Fig. 8 9. Research day, Avebury Study Centre, Wiltshire, 2012.image [images/9781620558683_066.jpg]Fig. 8.10. EEG tests.After visual inspection an epoch of each of the six recordings was selected(eyes closed, minimal eye movement, and electromyographic artifact).These samples were analyzed using FFT and frequency maps produced by thepsychology department at Leicester University.As you can see, the result of the procedure (brain mapping) below, over a periodof time, is expressed in Power that reads as uV2 (amplitude squared).image [images/9781620558683_067.jpg]Fig. 8.11. Gamma brain-wave results, before, during, and after visiting theLiddington circle, 2012. Anne’s results on the left, Gill’s results on theright. Four types of brain waves were measured: alpha, beta, and low and highgamma.Paul’s analysis of Anne’s results are shown in figure 8.11 on the left, Gill’son the right, with the following frequencies: alpha 8–12 Hz, beta 13–30 Hz, lowgamma 31–45, high gamma 54–70 Hz:I leave it to you to make what you will of the results, my comments are thatGill had a good symmetrical alpha rhythm whereas Anne didn’t, but littledifference occurred suggesting they were in the same states of relaxation. Thebeta/gamma showing in Anne’s “before” over the right mid-temporal area is likelyto be slight jaw tension. I can’t explain the fast increase in Gill’s low andhigh gamma.A CONE OF ENERGYHazel Drummond reported:As soon as we were in the circle I could feel a kind of buzzing and slightheaviness in my legs. I felt a bit uncomfortable as if the energies wereslightly negative. I tried using my pendulum and was interested to see that itwas turning anticlockwise (negative) no matter where I went in the circle;however, when I went into the center I found that it immediately turnedclockwise and did so in a circle around me. Interestingly that was when JamesLyons came up and told me that there was a cone of energy rising from thatcentral spot. I felt really well standing in the center. I could have stayedthere all day. I felt well and energized—very different from the rest of thecircle. After leaving the circle I felt quite woolly-headed, and that continuedall day Monday and Tuesday, as often happens after the crop circle day. I alsohad a horrendously sore throat and no voice on the Sunday evening and Monday butthat could have been due to the crop affecting me. By Wednesday I felt back tonormal.With Parkinson’s sufferers the brain finds adjusting to narrow spaces a problem,and Gill Puttick had great difficulty walking up the tramline toward the circle.However, after being in the circle, she led the way out of the formationstriding along the tramlines without any problems whatsoever. In addition, whileinside the circle she had been able to get up out of the floppy canvas-seatedchair (not everyone could) but after the double control tests at the perimeterof the field, she was unable to do so.Puttick reported:My medication is 2 Symmetrel, each tablet is 100 mg amantadin hydrochloride. 1Mirapexin either 2.62 or 2.1—this is prolonged-release pramipexole. This drugcan make you gamble, over-sexed, and many other things. It didn’t work for me;it only had a good effect. 1 Madopar 100mg/25mg three times a day. Levodopa +Benserazide.As for me I’ve had two good days with lots of energy. Sleep was better even if Idid pummel my husband Chris on the shoulder. He was glad his back was toward me;I slept in the other room last night.Going back to walking through the field. I have a problem with starting off whenmy meds are low and narrow spaces are a nightmare. It sounds silly but the braindoesn’t send the message to the feet to move.My feet feel very odd; it’s like being on ice skates [and] they get quitepainful. When the meds switch me on I’m away. I would like to try the circleagain with no meds. I would need a driver.The last two weeks I’ve had a lot of energy, making birthday cakes for eightiethand ninetieth birthdays. Sorting out a tea party for mother-in-law (ninety), Ididn’t slow down, walked miles round a steam engine rally in Norfolk.A BUMPY RIDEIn 2013 we conducted the tests in a lovely crop circle at Overton, part of thefamous ancient road called the Ridgeway that stretches from Avebury, Wiltshire,eastward across southern England, passing the Uffington Chalk White Horse on itsmeandering way before ending up at Beacon Hill in Hertfordshire. The circleconsisted of a central circle surrounded by nine rings with a standing centerapproximately 120 feet in diameter.Unfortunately clinical physiologist Paul Gerry from the Devon and ExeterHospital was unable to join us, as a portable EEG was not available. HazelDrummond of NutriVital Health, who has been a most important longtime part ofthe team, Parkinson’s sufferer Gill Puttick, Dr. Roger Taylor, and myself werethe only ones, as James Lyons had mistaken the day and various other mishaps hadbefallen the other participants. As it turned out it was just as well, as thetrek in 90-degree heat was only for the fittest. Gill Puttick clearly couldn’twalk that distance, so I took her in my car. This was a most perilous journey asthe track was deeply rutted, ten inches deep in places; getting there we onlyfell in once, but twice on the way back, and each time I doubted if my car wouldsurvive, but survive it did most valiantly. As Gill and I were driving along andstill finding no sign of the circle and indeed no chance of seeing it in theflat landscape, we feared that either we had passed it or that we would neverfind it. Suddenly in a field to our left we saw two people stand up briefly. Wehad found it, but only because those people had momentarily stood up! Taylor andDrummond joined us on foot, and we walked into the most delightful nine-ringedcircle. As I was walking in, I had a sense of music and, knowing that numberscarry frequencies, felt sure that this was what I was “hearing.” We conductedthe tests in blistering heat. Gill, who had had trouble walking down thetramline, strode out of the field without any problems.image [images/9781620558683_068.jpg]Fig. 8 12.

Hazel Drummond at Honey Street in Pewsey Vale, WiltshireI sent a photograph of the circle to James Lyons and was fascinated by hisfindings.However, this formation is far from simple since it embodies in a remarkable waythe key numbers of Earth Energy patterns most certainly including Crop Circles.For some twenty years at least, the number of a circle, namely Pi (3.14159 . . .) is implicit in most formations. A second number Phi (1.6180339 . . . ), or theGolden Mean, is also well known, since it is present in all of Nature, includingthe human form. What is relatively new is the presence of a now well-establishedconstant termed Delta (4.6692 . . . ), the first number of Chaos. Since Natureis studied as a dynamic process, it is not surprising to find delta appearing inthe Crop Circle scenario. It is the key to understanding the most elusive aspectof the phenomenon—namely, the conscious link.[After more discussion he goes on to say,] All these numbers are identifiablewithin the diatonic music scale. [He ends by saying,] The final point to make isthat this formation in such a simple yet elegant form reveals to us theprinciples of the crop circle phenomenon we have uncovered in the last twentyyears or so are fundamentally correct. The Cosmos is all One.A NEW EXPERIMENTThe year 2014 was another memorable time, and it found us in the most exquisitecrop circle of the year, consisting of delicately diminishing spirals that hadappeared at Forest Farm only a few minutes north of Marlborough.image [images/9781620558683_071.jpg]Fig. 8.15. Forest Farm, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, July 16, 2014.Gill Puttick was with us once again when we visited this circle, as was TinaMartin, an Essential Tremor sufferer.This was an experimental day as the circle had been harvested two days before weconducted our tests, but I was of the opinion that the “energy” would still bepresent in the fallen crop and indeed this proved to be the case, as the resultsshowed.As always we started the day by conducting tests at the Avebury Study Centre.The Parkinson’s tests this year were ones recommended by a neurologist andespecially aimed at this condition. They were carried out by Paul Gerry, who wasonce again with us. Our guinea pigs were Gill Puttick, who had been with me forthree years; Tim Challoner, who refuses to take any medication; and Tina Martin.In addition Paul tested several other non-sufferers, including Angie Kibble,James Lyons, and me.Among the tests were 1. Glabella tap test. This is a primitive reflex where the eyes shut if an individual is tapped lightly between the eyebrows. This reflex may normally be overcome rapidly—that is, the individual soon fails to blink—usually in less than five taps. In a patient with frontal release signs the reflex cannot be overcome, and they continue to blink for as long as the examiner cares to keep tapping. A similar response is seen with late Parkinsonism.image [images/9781620558683_072.jpg]Fig. 8.16. Administering the Glabella tap test at scientific research day, 2014. 2. Timed dot and cross test. This entails using a tablet computer in which the program is installed, and where the person being tested moves their finger as fast and accurately as they can from one dot to the other in a timed period.image [images/9781620558683_073.jpg]Fig. 8.17. The timed dot and cross test. 3.

A vibration sensor for Parkinson’s disease patients.Tim Challoner wrote after visiting the circle at Forest Farm:I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s just over one year ago. I have been to thedoctor and specialist about the condition, but I have chosen not to go onmedication. Instead I take natural, mostly Neways, products.My condition expresses itself in the form of lack of energy, a little shaking(tremors), and difficulty in sleeping. Also part of my condition expressesitself in lack of facial expression and a little difficulty in enunciatingwords.My body can be rigid at times and moving can be labored. Despite this I believemy thinking is sharp, and I remain positive and open to any help with mycondition.Yesterday within the circle, I felt relaxed and at peace, on the way home I wassleepy. I think it is too early to say if there has been a shift for the better.But I do hope there is a circle that has an energy that will make a difference.MY HAND STOPPED SHAKINGTina Martin wrote:As a bit of background, I have a Familial Essential Tremor. This has been inthree generations of my family (and maybe more but I do not have thatinformation). My tremor was at a very low level up to six years ago when, in aperiod of stress, it worsened. I am a painter, and teach painting, and sincethis worsening I now do all my art work with my left (nondominant) hand and mosttasks also. The tremor is in my dominant right hand chiefly, and at a low,occasional, level in my head. I take a very low dose of a beta-blocker for this,Propranolol, 20 mg a day. I am unable to increase this dose, as it affects myblood pressure.The major thing I noticed in the circle was that my right hand (which had beenshaking very badly when the initial tests were done) was completely still.Looking at the two hands there was no difference between them. The right hand isnever completely still like that, and I commented on it at the time. Thinkingabout it now, I think I would have liked to do a writing test before, within,and out of the circle. It would have been interesting to see if the effectshowed in the writing, and maybe how long the effect lasted.This handwriting test suggested by Tina is an excellent one, easy to do, andeasy to interpret. (See here [9781620558683_c08.xhtml#pg151] for more details.)WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATER?Gill Puttick recounted:I was still on the same medication at this time. My day started with a phonecall at 7:20 from Lucy just checking if I’m awake. I’d been up since 6:10 a.m. Iarrived at Lucy’s just before 8:00. A good start to an informative day out.Hazel set up and did her test. She said my ears and tubes were not happy; Iawoke next day with a sore throat. The test also showed I was unbalanced.Paul Gerry tapped my forehead, had me tapping his tablet and holding his mobilephone.I had a chat with Tim, who also has Parkinson’s but not on any medication; Iwould have liked a longer chat. Tim has made up his mind he doesn’t wantmedication; that’s his choice but he could feel so much better and have aquality of life.We set off for the circle. I will admit to being a bit of a skeptic, but thistime I saw dowsing rods move in the same place every time. Whilst watching thisI took a sip of my water; it was warm. I walked across the circle and tookanother sip expecting it to be warm only to find it was cold. Now explain thatone to me.Hazel did her test again in the circle only to find I was balanced again; thissurprised us both. Paul did his test.ENCOURAGING RESULTSPaul Gerry’s results were one of the most illustrative of any we have had in thepast. They showed clearly the differences between the Parkinson’s and EssentialTremor volunteers and the non-sufferers.In particular after the first control tests at Avebury Study Centre andsubsequently both inside the circle and later outside the circle (second controltests), the reduction of tremor by 18 percent and 15 percent during the secondcontrol tests is a dramatic revelation (fig. 8.19). This is most exciting, andshows us that we can in the future use freshly cut-out crop circles for ourtests.Also conducting scientific tests in 2014 was Hazel Drummond of NutriVitalHealth, who has generously given her time and energy to this research for manyyears using the renowned Asyra (Quest 4) technique, which covers a broadspectrum of investigation and consists of various tests as listed below. 1. Baseline test: this test measures energy states in major organs and systems. This can give an indication of which organs are out of balance and could indicate health problems. 2. Comprehensive test: thousands of test items in the computer’s database are tested to show whether one has been affected by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and so forth. We run three tests: the initial tests in the Avebury Study Centre, next identical tests inside the circle, and the third identical one outside the circle. These three identical tests are compared and analyzed.image [images/9781620558683_075.jpg]Fig. 8.19. Control test results from Paul Gerry for inside and outside the cropcircle. 3. Hormonal imbalance in the endocrine system: Thirty-one hormonal signatures are tested for imbalances. 4. Neurotransmitters. 5. Brain-wave patterns. 6. Vertebral misalignments. 7. Meridian disturbances. 8. Electrolyte disturbances. 9. Chakra imbalances: the seven chakras are tested. 10. Geopathic stress and harmful energies: This part of the testing protocol looks at one’s exposure to Earth Energy fields, electromagnetic stress, mineral deposits, power lines, microwave energies, radioactive exposure, ultraviolet waves, and X-rays.Drummond’s results mirrored Gerry’s results. There were four people showingquite severe imbalances initially in the Avebury Study Centre control tests—thethree Parkinson’s and Essential Tremor sufferers and me. The fact that I showedup so detrimentally illustrated the stress and tension I had been under!However, inside the circle our results showed quite marked improvement.On the other hand, whereas Emily Weeks felt great before entering the formation,she was the only person to feel really ill inside the circle, and this wasclearly demonstrated by Drummond’s results by showing up as imbalance in thebaseline tests.image [images/9781620558683_076.jpg]Fig. 8.20. Scientific research day, Forest Farm, near Marlborough, Wiltshire,2014.This turned out to be a pioneering experimental day and one that reaped moreunusual results than on many previous occasions. One of the most interestingthings about the circle was that none of the participants seemed to notice thatthe standing pattern had been cut out, perhaps because so many strange effectswere being felt and monitored.I WAS THROWN OFF THE SPOTWhile inside the circle I experienced an effect never felt before. ClairvoyantMona da Silva came up to me and told me that she had found a certain spot in thecircle on which she could not keep her balance and kept being thrown off.Fascinated, I followed her and after a bit she found the exact spot (no meanachievement in a 200-foot-diameter circle). Was it really happening? I steppedonto it and was immediately rocked backward a couple of steps. I tried itseveral times with exactly the same result. What was happening? Was it due tosome vortical energy? Maybe we will never know. If anyone has also experiencedthis effect, please write to let me know.Mona described her experience in the circle thus:I felt at the spot I showed you—it was as if I was in water at the beach whereyou stand and are rocked back and forth and lose balance where you feel risingand swaying down again. This became more intense after about a minute—I was in a“meditative” mode. I could see colors in my head—intense violet cerise to red—itfelt warm to be in. It felt as if I was within a living organism. I know that inthe bright sunshine I saw Paul Craddock’s body almost as a silhouette—that wasthe bright Sun/glare with the clear shape of his hat—but with this figure thiswas not the case, it was different.I shut my eyes and just followed the “flow.” I have to say that when I was atthe watery feel end I did turn to the left and felt there was energy drawing onthe other end in a line, or should I say, a large block/oblong range. However,walking as I did, which was with eyes shut and feeling my way somewhatrandom/circular, I ended in the second spot where the energy was so muchstronger—intense red and orange-pink colors in my head—staying longer it alteredto being golden and then pearlescent/rainbow flecks. It was this spot I pointedout to Paul, Tim, and so on. It seemed to be a small circular shape on theground but that was not my awareness when going there—we only noticed later.Also, that position was in an alignment with the previous spot on the right, andnot a spot but a position that kept shifting slightly for both “spots.” Though Ifelt it was like a long chunk of energy flow within that alignment.image [images/9781620558683_077.jpg]Fig. 8.21. Mona standing in the center of the circle, Forest Farm, nearMarlborough, Wiltshire, 2014.I can still connect with that amazing energy, and I thank you for letting usshare this with you and all the wonderful people there—not least all who testedTim—I know he felt the benefit of the experience too.The other thing I noticed was how restful and calm it felt in the circle; timeseemed to stand still and it was a very relaxing feel.Asyra (Quest 4) expert Hazel Drummond reported that “I felt very happy in thecircle very calm and balanced. I felt happy and would have loved to have stayedlonger. Stephen actually admitted to me that he felt a bit nauseous and a bitheadachy in the circle, which really surprised him, as he didn’t expect to feelanything. This passed off after leaving the circle though.”MY FIRST EXPERIENCEAnd finally, Angie Kibble, who was tested by Gerry alongside James Lyons and me,told me:It was my first experience of being in a crop circle; I didn’t know quite whatto expect despite having read several books on the subject over the years. WhenI am out dowsing on Dartmoor quite often I am able to pick up energy lineswithout using dowsing rods as I experience a kind of buzzing sensation in myhead—for want of a better description—when I cross them. When I reached thecenter of the crop circle on Sunday I was aware of a similar sensation, whichseemed stronger in certain areas, to the extent that I became quite nauseous andfelt the need to move away from what seemed to be the source of the sensation. Ilay down on the edge of the crop circle for some minutes, which felt a bitbetter, and whilst looking up at the sky I was aware of lots of tiny dancingpinpricks of light, which appeared to be multicolored. This was very differentto the odd “floating” specks you occasionally see going across your eyes whendrifting off to sleep, and was rather lovely.When you walked me around the crop circle to a different spot I did feel alittle better, but it wasn’t until we left the circle and walked right away thatI felt completely all right again. I noticed that I felt very energized forseveral hours afterward, but by the evening I was so weary I didn’t know whereto put myself. Being a novice I am not sure if this is a standard reaction!image [images/9781620558683_078.jpg]Fig. 8.22. Conducting control test outside the circle, Forest Farm, nearMarlborough, Wiltshire, 2014.So as not to influence the test results until all the tests had been conducted,participants are encouraged to drink only water to avoid dehydration. As we hadnot eaten since breakfast time our tummies were rumbling, but at last werepaired, as the previous year, to the charming Honey Street Café, run and ownedby a dedicated and hardworking young couple, Joe and Sophie. Lying alongside thecanal and close to and beneath the Alton Barnes Chalk White Horse, it is aperfect place to relax in their wonderfully comfortable wicker armchairs andenjoy not only the delicious home-cooked food but the perfectly landscapedsummer garden. Here we discussed our preliminary results and experiences beforegoing our separate ways.Gill Puttick reported: “I struggled walking into the circle, but managed to walkout leading the way.”Essential Tremor sufferer Tina Martin wrote:The major thing I noticed in the circle was that my right hand (which had beenshaking very badly when the initial tests were done) was completely still. Myright hand is never completely still like that. I would have liked to do awriting test before, within, and out of the circle to see if the effect showedin the writing, and maybe how long the effect lasted.MY HAND STOPPED SHAKINGHer wish was granted when in 2015 we conducted our tests (see here[9781620558683_c08.xhtml#pg152]), using the same program as before, when wevisited the circle that turned out to be one of my favorites of all time, thebeautiful Uffcott “Rose” near Wroughton in Wiltshire. Appearing on midsummer’sday, it was a joy to behold.As always, we carried out the same research procedure by conducting preliminarytests at Avebury Study Centre, then tests inside the circle, and later a secondcontrol test some distance from the circle.The story behind this circle is a poignant one. In November 2014 the farmerJames Hussey, who owns this field and the surrounding land, lost his lovelywife, Gill, after a fourteen-year battle with breast cancer. I knew her well,and she was a most lovely lady with a huge love and respect for the circles.They had always generously allowed people to visit the circles on their land.They were a most devoted couple.The field where this circle appeared was one where Gill used to ride regularly,and somehow it seemed fitting that this glorious crop circle depicting a roseshould find its resting place just there. As we all know, the rose is a symbolof love, among other things, so what clearer message could Gill have sent herhusband James? Even if I didn’t know that the rose is a symbol of love, thestrength of love emanating from the frequencies that radiate and pour out ofthis photograph are overwhelming.image [images/9781620558683_079.jpg]Fig. 8 23. Uffcott Rose, near Wroughton, Wiltshire, June 22, 2015.To the ancient Egyptians the rose was sacred to Isis, and the ancient Greeks andRomans identified the rose with the goddess of love, Aphrodite (Greek name) orVenus (Roman name).Islam and Sufism also considered the rose to be a symbol of love, using it ingeometric gardens where it held pride of place. The rose’s association with thesong of the nightingale was considered to have been inspired by love and by thebeauty of the rose, as portrayed in the poems of Hafez.Medieval Christians identified the five petals of the rose with the five woundsof Christ, and a red rose as a symbol of love—often given to a loved one onValentine’s Day.We frequently see wonderful rose windows in churches and cathedrals comprisingfive or ten segments (the five petals and five sepals of a rose). The rose isthe national flower of England, and Henry VII used it to create the Tudor rose,which combined the red and white roses of the noble Houses of Lancaster andYork.Indeed, the rose universally depicts Love, so what greater tribute could GillHussey have sent not just to James but also to everyone? James set up a charityto raise money for a breast-screening unit in Swindon as the closest unit was inOxford, and for Gill and others to have to travel many hours for a dailytreatment lasting a few minutes each time over a period of six weeks wasaltogether too exhausting and draining. Everyone who visited the rose and laterthe “Thunder Bird” crop circle gave generously to the fund, and James, byorganizing events such as marathons, was able to raise almost £10,000. This wasa fitting testimony to Gill’s love of life, James, and people in general.

The Tudor Rose.THE MIND MIRROR SYSTEMWith James’s permission, this was the circle we used for our 2015 scientificresearch day. He kindly left it unharvested so that we could conduct the tests.As usual we began the day at Avebury Study Centre, which is well equipped withplenty of power outlets. Paul Gerry, clinical physiologist from Devon and ExeterHospital, kindly joined us once again, and NutriVital Health expert HazelDrummond was also there to conduct the scientific tests. Gerry was using the newMM (Multi-Mirror) system, which is a highly complex machine that, in addition totesting for brain activity, can record a person’s autonomic system (this ismeasuring parts of our body that are not under our control, such as heartbeat,intestines, movements of the pupil of the eye, and chemistry of the blood).In figure 8.26 [9781620558683_c08.xhtml#pg144], on the far right of the screenare traffic lights giving indication of quality of signal; green means strong.To the left of the lights is the Mind Mirror shape, with the highest frequencyat the top. On the top left are the raw brain-wave traces. Bottom left is afrequency spectrum, which gives frequency (vertical axis) and time (horizontalaxis), and color is the amount—yellow is large amount. Gerry was measuring whatwas happening to their brains over five-minute periods while resting their headsagainst the wall with eyes closed. Gerry tested James and Gill Puttick, TinaMartin, and Mona da Silva. Figures 8.27 and 8.28 show the three changes for Monabefore our excursion to the circle, inside the circle, and then outside thecircle, respectively. The orange depicts the gamma levels. The analysis of thesetests is complete.image [images/9781620558683_081.jpg]Fig. 8.25. Crop-circle research day, Avebury Study Centre, Wiltshire, 2015.image [images/9781620558683_082.jpg]Fig. 8.26.

Gamma frequencies before, inside, and after leaving the crop circle.As she had on previous research days, Hazel Drummond used the Asyra techniqueand generously gave her time and energy to this research. The Asyra techniquecovers a broad spectrum of investigation, and it is fascinating to look back andsee how the technology and methodology has improved. Parkinson’s diseasesufferers Gill Puttick and Tim Challoner (accompanied by clairvoyant Mona)together with Essential Tremor sufferer Tina Martin all gallantly put themselvesforward to be tested again. Gill also brought along her son James who issuffering from an as-yet-undiagnosed condition of extreme fatigue syndrome,which has steadily grown worse over the last few years. Also with us was Hazel’shusband, Stephen. They had driven all the way from Manchester, setting off atthe crack of sparrows that morning.image [images/9781620558683_085.jpg]Fig. 8 29. Asyra testing done on scientific research day, 2015.We then proceeded to the rose formation at Uffcott conveniently close toAvebury. As the circle was already three weeks old, I was concerned that itwould be past its best.Despite the dire warnings of wet weather, the day turned out to be roasting hotwith not a drop of rain. As we drove down the narrow road to Uffcott I was notaltogether sure in which field the crop circle lay, so as we neared the area, asfar as I could remember seeing it from the air, I asked James Puttick, who isover six feet tall, to get out and stand on a hay bale at a gap in the hedge.This is what he wrote:As we left the center and traveled toward the circle I was suffering thedisorientation I always feel when traveling by car through country that is newto me. After ten minutes of driving and navigating we arrived in the generalarea of the circle, but we did not know its actual location. I jumped out of thecar, and as soon as my feet touched the ground my disorientation was instantlygone! I instantly knew my location and could feel where the circle was—it waslike a low frequency buzz through the ground—I could feel it. I turned toward itand looked through a gap in the hedge, I could not see it, so I jumped on a baleand looked where I knew it was and still couldn’t see it.I was sort of miffed I couldn’t see it because I knew at a base level that waswhere it was in the field. So I looked along the hedge line from where I was andsaw a person a little further along next to a vehicle. I knew we were meetingthe farmer (who kindly allowed the circle to remain) at this location, so Ireturned to the car and we parked up. This is where my day got strange.We made our way into the field and, on reaching the circle, we dowsed for thearea of strongest “energy.” It became clear that in the lower part of the circleclosest to the road, there were a series of strong vortices rendering several ofus quite dizzy and unsteady. Both Paul and Hazel set up their instruments andthe tests were repeated. We stayed in the circle for some time making furtherinvestigations. It was clear that this was a formation containing unusually high“energies,” and I was relieved that I had not taken our group in when it wasfresher, as I believe the “energies” would have been too great, especially forthose of us who are “sensitive.” We met James Hussey at the edge of the field onleaving. He was interested to hear how we had got on and what had happened.image [images/9781620558683_086.jpg]Fig. 8 30. Uffcott Rose, near Wroughton, Wiltshire, June 22, 2015.We conducted the second control tests further down the road near the hedge.Unusually, Hazel’s battery had been completely drained by the circle, so shemade her way to the local pub where she was allowed to plug into theirelectrical system and finish the tests. We all met up there, and it was clear tous that this had been no ordinary circle. Here are some of the other interestingreports I was sent.Hazel reported:Because the crop circle that we were about to visit was over three weeks old Ihad no expectations of any “energetic” disturbances affecting me. Over the yearsof going with Lucy on the research days, some circles have had very strongenergies, which have sometimes made me feel ill for a few days after. Some havenot affected me at all.I was about halfway from the entrance to the field and the circle when itsuddenly hit me. I felt a very strong weakness and trembly feeling throughout mywhole body. The feeling took me by surprise, and it grew stronger as we reachedthe inside of the circle. I felt a sort of whirling energy that was incrediblystrong. I didn’t particularly want to sit down in it but thought that it wouldbe good to do the testing at such a strong energetic point and will beinterested to see the results on all of the test subjects. I continued with thatstrong trembly feeling until we left the circle and didn’t feel any particularaftereffects except that I felt very well that week.At one point during the afternoon I walked around the circle with rods and wasagain struck by the force of the energy and noted that there were definitepoints around the circle where it was even stronger and where the arms of therods were twisting through 360 degrees and even spinning around again.James Puttick’s story continued:The day had started with a jump when I was woken early with yells of “We’regoing earlier, get a move on!” This is not the way of a normal Sunday. Onarriving at the Avebury Study Centre I was a bit more awake than in the firsthours of the day, I found the science used fascinating. It was great to talkwith everyone in a more relaxed setting, and to learn more about the circles andthe land where they occur. I was aware of both Paul and Hazel’s methods, and Iunderstood the principles behind them, but this was the first time that I hadseen them being used in front of me. The results of my tests on Hazel’sequipment were very surprising and highlighted one problem in my body that I hadsuspected for a while but my doctor had told me to ignore.I felt energized as I entered the circle, my mind cleared, my body felt lightand supple, for the first time all day I felt great, none of the usual bodyaches and tiredness. This continued for about thirty minutes after we left thecircle, but then I crashed as we were doing the last tests at the interim stop,my body felt heavy again but my mind was still clearer than at the start of theday.After I had sat down for a few minutes at the river my mind started to get foggyagain, and I noticed I was getting confused whilst talking to people. It wasonly then that I realized that all the time I was in the circle and the timejust after leaving it, how good I felt and how clear my mind was. I cannotexplain this effect.It is interesting to note that many “sensitive” people find that the circlesincrease this effect. Mona da Silva wrote telling me this interesting series ofsubsequent events:I had an extreme reaction for about five days afterward—my eyes were very soreand constantly watering—I was told that this was due to hay fever by the doctor.It started when I was in the crop circle and I just kept wiping my eyes—did notthink about it. The last time I went the crop had been harvested (2014 cropcircle tests). However, I have been near hay before and not had such an extremereaction.Whilst there I was aware of the energy from the mast, however, when walking tothe circle and on entering the periphery there was a strong draw toward the cropcircle. The energy felt different to the crop circle last year—with this onethere was the moving up and down of energy almost like being on soft waves ofthe sea when swimming, under one’s feet and yet the areas where it happened alsoseem to be moving in swirls.I know that there were tests taken before and after, one of which was thewriting in the circle, and I certainly could not write properly on the paper.Also the measurements taken from your colleague (Paul or Hazel?). I know that atthe end test we aborted the results as the measurement was not so easy toconduct. I do think that it may also have been me—I do meditate and can go intohigher frequency—my definition of going into theta as a practicing ThetaHealer Ithink might be different from what is being measured.When we finished at the pub with final measurements and drinks, etc., I then gotinto the car to drive off. I think you came over to check when you found I hadstopped further down the road—at a time when I was checking the GPS, which didnot appear to be operating properly. As we were parked, the others drove offtoo, overtaking us, and finally we were able to pull out and drive off too. Ihad to turn off some 200 yards and it was soon after that I can only describeseeing opaque/white forms, about the height of a child maybe 2 to 3 feet and itwas the sound of them speaking that I remember—a language I could not make out—Iwas driving and had to tune out. It was like they flashed in front of me talkingto each other and directing to me and flashed out again, about three or four, Ithink.Now please do not think me weird or unhinged. Last week I did some further workwith Theta and linking to minerals, crystals, and plants. It was not until I wasabout to fall asleep that it suddenly clicked that when I tuned in to the plant,which was a growing orchid, I heard a language and realized that it was similarto what I had heard from the opaque forms. Their heads were larger than ours androunder and maybe a third in length to their body—two arms and twolegs—reminding me of the form of paper cutout figures.The figure I saw last year was different; the energy from the form was moreauthoritative or assured, heading toward me with purpose and I tuned out. Idescribed it as having a long body and very tall and having a very large headshaped like an old-fashioned keyhole.After having visited the crop circle last year, very soon after I experienced atodd times in the night flashing lights by the kitchen window and even by a verylarge window on the landing, and Tim felt it by one of the bedrooms—the energywas quite overwhelming and actually quite scary—I really felt vulnerable. Thiswas not passing car lights; it was higher in the sky. At about this time I cameacross Andara crystals and found them to have energy that helped and what I feltwas more divine and full of light; this seemed to help dissipate what I had beenencountering.This time, with this crop circle and what I experienced with the childlikeforms, the energy was very different like curious playful chattering, notoverwhelming. What I can say is that I have noted a connection with “cropcircle” and “plant” in the language I tuned in too. Please note I had not triedto tune in to any plant before, it was part of training I was doing with Thetaonly last week. Tim has said that he could not stay in the center; the energywas so strong it was making him feel sick. I will type anything else he may wantto add tomorrow—send it very quickly to you.I admire you for how you continue to keep up the good work! If ever you go upagain in a helicopter to see a crop circle, please ask me, I would beinterested—only ever had one flying lesson—would love to be able to fly a planeon my own. Now would that not be fun?Tim sensed there were a number of vortices around the circular walkway, that is,the flattened crop. He felt relaxed in the center of the circle but not on theperiphery where the flattened walkway was going to the outside of the circle.Jennifer Percival, who runs a training course for the NHS, wrote:Thank you for asking me to attend this year’s research event. It was a veryinteresting day!In terms of aftereffects from visiting the circle—I wanted to let you know thatI became very tired and felt exhausted as the afternoon wore on. This is highlyunusual for me. I also slept for ten hours that night, which I haven’t done inyears, so I guess this was to do with my time in the circle’s energy field.On closer analysis, Hazel Drummond’s results revealed an interesting pattern.“Seven of the nine showed a noticeably increased imbalance inside the circle ascompared to first control tests at the Avebury Study Centre. This imbalance wasmaintained in four of the nine in the second control tests outside the circle.”In addition, five of the nine showed a change in hypothalamus levels. Thehypothalamus is a very important part of the forebrain, which lies below thethalamus and forms the lower part of the ventricle and its floor. Its integrityis essential to life. As noted above, it plays a major part in regulation of thetemperature of the body, body weight, and appetite, sexual behavior and rhythms,blood pressure, and fluid balance, and it is suggested that it could even besaid to be the physical basis of the emotions.In figure 8.31, the blue lines are the first tests conducted at the AveburyStudy Centre, the orange lines show repeat tests taken inside the circle, andthe gray lines are double-control tests conducted outside the circle. Taking 60as the norm, you can see how the orange lines fluctuated.The change in Tina’s writing was quite dramatic, especially as she did not haveanything hard on which to press when writing inside the circle. However, as youcan see in figure 8.32 [9781620558683_c08.xhtml#pg152], the deterioration overthe following days was noticeable. Tina mentioned that she found trying to drawa spiral was one of the most difficult things she attempted. Straight lines werealso a problem.image [images/9781620558683_087.jpg]Fig. 8.31.

Effects of the crop circles on Tina’s handwriting: (a) before goinginto the crop circle, (b) inside the crop circle, (c) after leaving the cropcircle.A PLASMA WALLOn July 23, three Spanish tourists visited the formation not knowing that it hadalready been harvested. On reaching the edge of field they realized that theywere unable to see where the circle had been. According to researcher CharlesMallett, “The three stood there looking into the field for remnants of thecircle when suddenly they noticed a ‘tornado’ of spinning crop and dirt down thefield about 115 meters [350 feet] from where they were standing.”They could see dirt and dust debris from the field appearing more or less in themiddle of the field. They described a very large, spinning tornado focused atthe center of the crop circle and then going up 60 to 70 feet. They went intothe field straight to where the tornado was happening, and as they approached itseemed that the tornado was coming up from the flattened ground and they thenfound themselves in the clearly defined flattened site where the circle hadbeen. The flattened crop was still lying unharvested. The tornado seemed to beemanating from the exact center where the crop circle had been. After a shorttime the tornado moved away and disappeared. At that point two of them decidedto return to their car, leaving just one Spaniard inside the circle.The remaining tourist then noticed another “tornado” forming on the ground ather feet—starting very small—then rising up in front of her about two feet away.And as she stood there, this tiny spinning vortex of air and dirt and dustlifted up out of the ground in front of her and rose up what she said was about11 to 12 meters (36 to 40 feet) in height; this rapidly spinning column of airwas very hot.She said the air started to move from her right to her left around her slightlyand never actually enveloped her. This vortex-like effect of “hot” spinning airand dirt then started to move around the circle then away from it at some speed,then more or less curled off and started to drift away down the field—at whichpoint the witness decided to follow it and she described it accelerating,starting slowly and then moving quite rapidly, and it was drifting off toward afield of maize-like sweet corn. She tried to follow it. She started to run asthis thing was picking up speed, a twelve-meters-high [39 feet] vortex ofspinning air and dirt rushing off down the field. As she moved toward the effectshe saw immediately in front of her an almost invisible, almost transparent, butnot quite a wall of what she described as energy, a pressure wave, almosttransparent but it physically stopped her in her tracks when she was trying tofollow this tornado.That wall stayed rigidly in place for some moments and then the tornadodisappeared down the field and cut into the maize field and this wall of energyhad a watery, glassy wall effect—you know when you blow children’s soap bubbles,they have this glossy, shimmering kind of colored effect?She was absolutely clear that she could see and pretty much feel, in a sense,this barrier that seemed to be stopping her. And all of this emanating frompretty much the center of a harvested crop circle. Once the tornado haddisappeared, the wall disappeared.This report reminded me of the time that Ray Barnes, who lives at Westbury,Wiltshire (and who was one of the first people to ever witness a crop circleform), described another strange event. On the evening of Thursday, July 26,1990, he was walking toward the field in which he had seen a circle appearseveral years before, when he noticed thatthere was a heath fire somewhere toward the west and the smoke from it wasblowing across the field. The smoke was so dense that I couldn’t see the skythrough it. But then something caught my attention. Halfway across the field itwas as if a glass “wall” had been erected. The smoke blew and billowed againstthe wall, but apparently could not cross it. To the left of the barrier the airwas clear, and the sky and clouds could be seen.What possible explanation could there be for these two similar events? Iconsulted James Lyons who, when I read out the description of the tornado“wall,” said he had never heard such a brilliant layman’s description of thefollowing. He explained thatmatter occurs in four phases—Gas, Liquid, Solid, and Plasma. Of these by far themost abundant is Plasma, which occupies 99.9 percent of the Cosmos. This form isseen most often in kitchen lighting or neon signs. It occurs naturally in Naturebeing the “shells” that cover ancient sites and crop circles. They appear likesoap bubbles sitting on a flat surface. Their structure was discovered in 1927by Langmuir who named these electric shells “Double Layers.” Plasma consists ofpositive and negative charge, similar to the terminals of a battery. Theelectric field can be extremely strong. Vortex centers in the Earth, which giverise to tornado-like spinning electric charges, generate these hemisphericalshells of such large radius (hundreds of meters) that they appear to bewall-like. They can be cloudy or shimmer like soap bubbles. People sense theseat ancient sites and elsewhere where strong vortex centers occur. They are ineffect akin to the human Aura that many people can “see” and/or “feel.”Such shells are often seen associated with tornadoes. If the vorticity is sogreat then people sense them as almost solid walls.The research will continue on an annual basis, and if this work can in any waymake a solid contribution to the furtherance of our understanding and curing ofParkinson’s disease that would be a tribute to everyone involved and to the cropcircles themselves. I hope that in time we may get sponsoring.COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]We have touched on many of the factors that influence the crop-circle creationprocess and, indeed, the resulting health effects on all animals, includingourselves. Yet it is not just the crop circle phenomenon that is under criticalscrutiny; the very foundations of current science from the cosmic to the quantumworlds is in dire straits. From the Big Bang via Dark Matter to Black Holes—allis being rigorously reassessed. Black Holes are now no longer claimed to bedramatic cosmic sinkholes, they are now termed “Gray.” Why? Because it has beenat last detected that columnar vortices emerge from their polar regions.These holes are located at the center of Galaxies of which there are literallyuncountable numbers. These Galaxies have usually four arms that emerge from theGalactic center as spiraling cones made of individual stars.Not in the least surprising is that this basic structural layout is modeled inthe crop circle world by the well-known Stonehenge formation, the Julia Set,observed by many bystanders forming over a time period of around twenty-fiveminutes. There are some 150 individual circles involved. This overall pattern issynonymous with the generic structure of a Galaxy. Additionally, thehemispherical cloud over the formation with a clear gap between its lowersurface and the ground mimics precisely the form we see in the creation processof many Galaxies. It is so true to say: As above, so below. This formationprocess has everything to do with the creation of all matter, includingourselves.Let us remind ourselves that there are only two topological structures that arerelevant to all creation: the torus (think of a finger ring) and a sphericalshell (like a Ping-Pong ball). Around these are wound spirals of filamentarystructures. They can be cross-wound such that we have right-hand and left-handspirals, often interleaved. All told they form a toroid. The whole result looksjust like a ball of string with its central hole.It is not in the least surprising to find that this form is key to Yogic Scienceand is indeed the universal physical atom discovered by Leadbeater and Besantover a century ago. It is the form of everyone’s auric field. Not surprisingly,all atomic particles can be modeled in this way as waves around toroids.We find this form in stone circles. The classic example is Castlerigg, whoseground pattern follows precisely the geometry of a single wave wrapped around atoroidal energy form whose center hole is the thickness of the ring. We findthese forms in volcanoes and dolphin rings as well as fairy rings.It is the interleaving of the right- and left-hand spirals that dictates theeffect of Earth Energies on living things. Males and females are created by thespiraling energy fields in their right- and left-brain hemispheres. It is thefrequency modulation of these two nested waves that determines the state ofhealth of individuals. The basic nesting of these spirals, like one Slinkyinside a larger outer one, dictates all living matter. It is the basic structureof the Birkeland currents that pervade the Cosmos.We thus arrive at the key point with regard to health effects in crop circles.The whole crop circle is created within a hemispherical shell. There arecolumnar vortices made up of nested spiraling columns of energy not unliketornados. These spiraling energies are modulated with frequencies that areresonant with Earth Energies such as 28 kHz, but there is a spectrum ofsub-frequencies down to the Schumann resonance of around 8 Hz. It is thespectrum of frequencies that exists in crop circles that interact with the humanbody and brain. As this book is being written, it is only just becoming possibleto analyze the spectrum of these frequencies within the brain. This process isabsolutely essential to the understanding of how these specific frequenciesinteract with humans in particular.The latest Mind Mirror equipment has the ability to undertake a completeanalysis of brain frequencies involved. This should enable us, even in the nearfuture, to start to comprehend how the energy interacts with the body. We expectfrom now on to be able to compile graphical material that indicates whatfrequencies are responsible for what effects. This in itself is a dramatic stepforward.However, there remains at least one irresolvable topic even with this process.EEG responses are generally from around 8 Hz to, say, 100 Hz. Many of theambient frequencies we are certain lie outside this band. Hence the question—canwe detect and understand all health effects in crop circles? The answer is mostlikely no, but the use of this technology should offer further insights toenable us to broaden our diagnostic base."},{"pageContent":"9THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN: NEGATIVE EFFECTSIf the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will beenough.MEISTER ECKHART (1260–1328)IN THIS CHAPTER WE WILL CONTINUE our human interaction journey and examine cropcircle effects on the systemic system. Systemic circulation is the part of thecardiovascular system that carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to thebody and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart. This area of studyincludes the body as a whole, and we will be looking at such symptoms asdizziness, weak knees, leg pain, and other physical reactions as well as the guteffects of nausea, diarrhea, sudden hunger, and so forth.I have found that I receive more negative than positive reports about visits tocrop circles, as people generally expect to feel well and are surprised whenthey do not. Indeed they are more likely to remark on an ill effect, whereas ifthey feel better or happier than normal it is often attributed to other factorssuch as the beauty of the formation, the warm Sun, a day out, or being in thecountry with family or friends. It is not until there is a markedly noticeablefeeling of well-being that the experience is described as being out of theordinary.Having visited over a hundred formations, I have personally experienced most ofthese different symptoms. My strong advice is that if you feel ill oruncomfortable in any way, leave the formation.Once again we are looking at a multitude of reports so being selective is of theessence.In 2007 an extraordinary formation appeared in East Field, Alton Barnes, nearMarlborough, Wiltshire, a location that regularly hosts crop circles, and is anarea of great electrical activity due to the complex pattern of energy linesrunning through the field together as well as the presence of undergroundaquifers. I received the following report:THROWN DOWN WITH ALL HIS MIGHTAfter lying down for about ten minutes, I proceeded to stand up, at which point,halfway up, I was strongly pulled backward to the ground, hitting my head andback very hard. As I was getting up, I felt and saw a circular motion around melike waves of energy going very fast, especially to the side on the right behindme. It took me a couple of days to find the words to describe how I felt. I feltI had become part of two magnets coming together.When I wrote back suggesting that her symptoms sounded like a “drop attack” shereplied, “I am not looking for an answer to what happened to me. Imagine beingpicked up by a very large wrestler and THROWN DOWN with all his might onto yourback, then you have some sense of what happened.”A second event was described with similar effects. “I nearly went flyingbackward, only managing to save myself by grabbing big handfuls of wheat as Idid not want to ruin the pattern by falling back onto the ground. After this Islowly tottered out leaning on a friend, back in one piece when outside thecircle.”Could these experiences have been the result of an atonic seizure or dropattack? A drop attack is a seizure in which a person suddenly loses muscle toneand strength and, unless supported, falls down, also called a drop seizure.Atonic means a lack of muscle tone and strength due to uncontrolled electricalactivity in the brain. Drop attacks are sudden spontaneous falls while standingor walking, with complete recovery in seconds or minutes. There is usually norecognized loss of consciousness, and the event is remembered. In most instances(64 percent), the cause of the drop attack is never definitively established.As already explained, one day each summer I bring together as many scientists aspossible using different techniques in order to try and establish a noticeablechange between the control tests and the repeated tests conducted inside a cropcircle. The 2007 East Field, Alton Barnes, formation was our chosen crop circle.Due to the number of bizarre effects reported, this formation is worthy of beingsingled out. These reports remain the most extraordinary and varied that I haveever received from one formation. The majority of them were negative despiteinitially starting off as positive.image [images/9781620558683_089.jpg]Fig. 9.1. 070707, East Field, Alton Barnes, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, July 7,2007.I HAD HORRIBLE NIGHTMARESThe comments below are just some of the reports I received from our group. * “I am not prone to nightmares, but had some horrible ones, probably for about two weeks afterward. I can’t remember them now, but they were nasty and stayed with me all day, dreams of death, injury, and so forth.” * “I had a sore throat and sore eyes also for about two weeks.” * “I am not generally a moody person, quite laid back really, but felt very angry for a long time—probably a month or even more? I am a counselor, so am fairly self-aware, and again, am generally a positive person, not given to dwelling on negatives. I tried to find all sorts of explanations for why I felt so bad for so long, but there didn’t seem to be any tangible reason.” * “I also had a disruption to my menstrual cycle.”Hazel Drummond, who had been with me in the small satellite circle after we hadconcluded the tests, ran around skipping like a schoolgirl. She had also lainflat on the ground. She reported that subsequently she suffered appallingnightmares (the type that are so terrible they wake one up in a muck sweat),panic attacks, and vibrating fingers for almost a week afterward. She also foundit almost impossible to concentrate on her work.Another member of the research group reported: * “I’ve been very weary but not aching, and mentally unfocused, particularly yesterday where I got no work done . . . just pottering about and talking with people. Sleep has been very disrupted and unsatisfying. I woke this morning at 1:29 and never really got back into a deep sleep.”Anne Leonard, vice president of the Dowsing Society, financial adviser, andfounder of Operation New World,*7 [9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft7] wrote telling mehow she felt the following day. * “Felt dizzy and dopey. I don’t know how else to describe it but really the day floated by somehow. I had a letter to sign and send off and I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO IT.”I had not heard from Christopher Weeks, so I telephoned him on the Thursdayafter our visit. He told me that unlike the others he had wanted to get out ofthe circle almost as soon as he entered. His heart was thumping and he feltunwell. He told me that subsequently he had had “panic attacks, terrible dreams,depression,” and his mind had been like “treacle.” He had been unable to get onwith his work.THE PAIN WAS EXCRUCIATINGThe night after our scientific tests, I woke at 1:20 a.m. with the most terriblepains running from inside my toes all the way up my shinbone to just under myknees. I tumbled out of bed and clung to the side of the bed for what seemedlike an eternity. The pain was excruciating, and I did not know how long I wasgoing to be able to cope with such a degree of agony. After approximately tenminutes the pain went, leaving a dull ache. I felt sure my legs would be coveredin bruises the following morning, but to my amazement there was not a blemish tobe seen. However my legs ached for the next five days. I am a crampy person butthis was something quite different; my muscles were not in spasm. Also it seemedthat the pain was located close to or in my shinbone.My experience reminded me of a report sent in by someone who had entered theformation on the morning it had appeared and who had knelt down on the flattenedcrop.I went into the formation 1:30 p.m. and had left the field itself by 2:30 p.m.Time of the first “spasm” to both legs: eight and a half hours later, lastingfor about twenty minutes. Then there was a gap of about three-quarters of anhour and then I had another “spasm” on the right leg only, same area. Firstevent: I was walking normally from a sofa in my living room toward my hall, whensome twenty feet from the sofa, the sudden onset of pain forced me to the floor,due to the complete seizure of both legs. The pain was generated from beyond thetoes to just below the knee, up the line of the shinbone. It was not in themuscles—all of which were quite relaxed during this experience. I am not a“crampy” person, and want it on record that this experience, while producingvery acute physical responses—did NOT actually occur within the bone or legitself. I also immediately knew that this was related to my earlier visit to thecrop formation in East Field. So I waited it out, while testing my ability tostand up from time to time. As soon as it ended, I staggered into my kitchen andtreated it by drinking cider vinegar with honey and hot water. The second attackto the right leg occurred after I had gone to bed. It was also unstoppable, evenin trying to bend, tense, and straighten muscles—there was no way of stoppingthe pain, which again focused on the length of the shinbone. Again the muscleswere completely relaxed. However, knowing that this was a crop event, I used mymind to control the pain, get out of bed, and go and get more cider vinegar,honey, and hot water. Although I had a lingering sensation in the area aroundand external to my right leg only—for several days after the event—it did notcome back. Given that my events, occurring outside the physical body, do notconcur with the actual physical symptoms of peroneal nerve problems, I am thusfar of the conclusion that this event occurred in the etheric but was “pickedup” by the sensors in the physical body. Perhaps surprisingly, I find myselfgrateful for the experience—it is still most educational!In order to try to get a scientific explanation for my experience, I eventuallywent to see my doctor, who ruled out any vascular condition owing to the factthat my legs were not bruised. After such excruciating pain I could not believethat my legs did not show any evidence of my horrible experience.She said I had described it as a nerve pain. We have a nerve called the peronealthat is associated with the sciatic nerve originating in the L5 lumbar vertebra.This nerve would act as a neurotransmitting agent, being triggered as a resultof some unknown energy force, possibly electromagnetic. It would appear that thepain was the result of a change in the current transmitting through nerve cells.Another member of the team told me that she had also been woken with terribleleg pains during the night following her visit and had been unable to get backto sleep.A woman who on entry was as excited “as a schoolgirl all over again and full oflife,” went from one circle to the next, each one feeling different. She thenstarted to feel that everything was not OK, couldn’t relax, and felt nauseous.image [images/9781620558683_090.jpg]Fig. 9.2. Two illustrations showing the location of the peroneal nerve.How can we explain this collection of independent experiences, a number of whichlasted several days?We are all surrounded by auras or electrical fields; the electrical field of ournatural environment is known as the Schumann resonance, vibrating at frequenciesranging between 8 and 32 Hz. Evidence of extremely low frequencies (ELFs) isseen in hormonal activity, governed by the pituitary and pineal glands deepwithin our brains. However, not only are we experiencing exposure to thisnatural energy field but also the residual frequencies of the originatingdescending crop circle force. How our physical and emotional behavioral patternsare affected and how we react will vary considerably, as we are all individualsendowed with our own particular metabolic clock.I STARTED BLACKING OUTCentre of Crop Circle Studies*8 [9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft8] branch coordinatorCarol Pederson visited a formation located at Whiskey Hill Road, near Hubbard,Oregon, with Keith Ardinger, and made a close examination of the laid crop. Shesent me this excellent report.When I first went in, I walked along the outer pathway and entered each circleas I came to it. Along the way, I felt dizzy several times. When we started tomeasure I began feeling a little sick but stuck with it. We started across onecircle and reached the intersection of the northmost circle with its outerpathway, and I told Keith I wasn’t feeling so well, and he told me to sit downfor a while. I kept on and then started blacking out and really feeling sick. Iknew if I stayed longer I would pass out completely. So I told him I had toleave the circle without completing the measuring and immediately (dizzily)picked up my bag and walked along the outer path out toward the weed fieldtoward the van. I had an imperative need to get out of there quickly. This isall very peculiar because I am very thorough and NEVER give up my work until Iam done, and yet this time I just felt compelled to get out and fast. When I gotto the van I put my head down on the hood and rested. I do not attribute thisexperience to the heat of the day; it was only 85 high that day, and it wasabout 5:30 anyway at that time. I am used to working in the heat; Keith and Ispent about eight hours in 100-degree heat in Eltopia researching thatformation, and I had just come back last week from Boise, Idaho, where I walkedaround a Basque Festival for three days in about 100-degree heat. So I attributethis experience to residual energy of the formation and that it affected meadversely.Japanese author and crop circle researcher Maseo Maki took a group of his fellowcountrymen into the Beckhampton “Knot” near Avebury, Wiltshire, in summer 1999.Later that evening, after having returned to their hotel in Marlborough, severalof them suffered from severe nosebleeds. I understood that none of thesesufferers was prone to nosebleeds and indeed did not suffer any furtherreoccurrence of the problem during the remainder of their tour. Epistaxis(nosebleed) is normally due to: (a) trauma/injury, (b) infection, (c) allergy,(d) malignant growths, (e) bleeding disorders.image [images/9781620558683_091.jpg]Fig. 9.3. Beckhampton Knot near Avebury, Wiltshire, July 28, 1999.HUNT THE BOTTLEUnfortunately, longtime friend and researcher Christopher Weeks is becoming moreand more reluctant to come into crop circles with me.On one particular occasion after we had visited the famous 2003 formation atOgbourne St. George, north of Marlborough, to bury my bottles of water,Christopher developed severe gout within forty-eight hours. This is not thefirst time it has happened to him after visiting crop circles. His goutrecovered, we returned a week later to collect the bottles, and all went welluntil I was digging up the final pair of controls when I noticed somethingunusual. “You have buried them one on top of each other instead of side byside.” “Yes,” said Christopher. As I removed the first bottle Christopher saidhe would dig out the second and took my trowel. We were chatting, and it wasseveral moments before Christopher said the other bottle was no longer there! Nolonger there? That was impossible, we had both seen it, and indeed I hadremarked on the white bottle top and the curious way Christopher had buried thepair! Christopher was so disturbed by its disappearance that he set aboutdigging up the area with furious determination. I feared he might excavate theentire perimeter of the field. The bottle was never found. Into what dimensionhad it disappeared?Within forty-eight hours Christopher developed gout once more. We know that goutoccurs as result of uric acid crystals collecting around joints, causing painfulinflammation. It is sometimes thought that an abundance of rich food and redwine or port can be the cause. Christopher is a vegetarian and teetotaler whoeats mainly organic foods.RED WINE AND CHOCOLATESThree other people who visited the formation all felt extremely thirsty as theyleft. Instead of drinking the water they had brought with them, they all cravedred wine. Two of them had forgotten this effect when they revisited theformation at a later date. Unexpectedly this effect was repeated. They arenaturally moderate red-wine drinkers but this compulsion was somethingdifferent. Could there be a chemical constituent that is common to both red wineand the cause of gout? Relating to red-wine reports, it has been suggested to methat the exogenous stimulus was a “kick” to the reward centers of the brain,rather than a subconscious seeking of an ingredient. This brings us to (a)dopamine production overstimulation, (b) the orbitofrontal cortex behind theeyes, and (c) opioid stimulation (endorphins and enkephalins) and the ventralpallidum.image [images/9781620558683_092.jpg]Fig. 9.4. Ogbourne St. George, north of Marlborough, Wiltshire, June 15, 2003.The next question is the energy input. Eddy currents, produced when magneticfields traverse the brain, are now coming to the fore in physics.Several years ago a young man sent me a report telling me that despite feelingslightly nauseous while inside a formation, he had desperately craved chocolate.Many people suffer from this condition, the late Princess Diana included. We aretold that whereas chocolate craving is often linked to eating disorders, thereare other possible reasons. The main active ingredient of chocolate is cocoa, asignificant source of the stimulant theobromine, which is a known mood elevator.In tests it has been shown that alcohol-loving rats, given the choice, willactually replace their alcohol intake in preference of chocolate. By doing this,the rats increase their level of dopamine, as chocolate appears to stimulate itsproduction. A study of rats shows that dopamine kick-starts a brain messengerchemical called DARPP-32 that in turn activates hormones that make femalesinterested in sex—hence Valentine’s Day chocolates.Researchers at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego have also discoveredthat novel constituents in cocoa powder and chocolate are chemical cousins ofanandamide, which binds to the same brain receptor sites as marijuana. Thismeans that chocolate chemicals may activate receptors for marijuana and thusmimic its psychoactive effects of heightened sensations and euphoria.What are the reasons for these strange cravings? Is there a dopamine linkbetween chocolate and red wine? But what about gout? When dealing with complexsubtle energies, their effects on areas of the brain are still not fullyunderstood.DYING FOR A DRINK AND AS HUNGRY AS A HORSEOnce again we must consider the hypothalamus, as it regulates our body fluidsand appetite.The author and researcher Freddy Silva reported:About half a mile before reaching the formation I felt pressure on my chest. Inthe formation I felt pressure near my pineal gland, also disorientation andmassive dehydration.In addition he had a severe headache. On leaving the formation he drank sixpints of water within the next hour. The extreme thirst lasted for twelve hours.After I’d been in the crop formation for about twenty minutes I became awarethat I was feeling very shaky (especially my legs) and I was incredibly hungry.I nearly tore open my sandwich box on the spot. The feeling lasted for theremainder of the day.On many occasions effects take people by surprise, as in my case. I am not a bigeater and quite often go comfortably without food from a light breakfast until alate lunch maybe around 4:00 p.m. We had just finished a good lunch at thenormal time, before visiting the Butser Hill formation, near Petersfield,Hampshire, to conduct hormone tests. The acute hunger I experienced as I walkedout of the circle was therefore most surprising and out of the ordinary.MY SHOES KEPT FALLING OFFArthritis and rheumatism sufferers seem to gain noticeable but temporary relief.Longtime sufferer Leslie Clementson has, over the years, sent me veryinteresting reports on her experiences in formations (see here[9781620558683_c01.xhtml#pg1]).The effects seem to vary from circle to circle. However, in some formations suchas the Lockeridge event (figs. 3.3 and 3.4), her swollen feet were so improvedthat her shoes kept falling off. The positive effects were, unfortunately, onlytemporary.We need to examine the possible reason for these encouraging reactions. We donot know enough about the “cause” of rheumatism or arthritis, but we do know theeffect is inflammation. Could the residual effects of the electromagnetic fieldspresent in some formations be acting as an anti-inflammatory? We are told thatthere are over a hundred types of arthritis, including osteoarthritis and gout.The word arthritis means “joint inflammation.” Inflammation is one of the body’snatural reactions to disease or injury, and includes swelling, pain, andstiffness. Inflammation that lasts for a very long time or recurs, as inarthritis, can lead to tissue damage.Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. With rheumatoid arthritis,something seems to trigger the immune system to attack the joints and sometimesother organs of the body. The exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown,but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic, environmental, andhormonal factors. Other theories suggest that a virus or bacteria may alter theimmune system, causing it to attack the joints.COLD HANDS AND HOT FEETOther bizarre reports come trickling in. Interior designer Polly Blackett sentme a report after visiting a formation the day it appeared. She was with a groupfrom London.I got the usual sort of connection, which I get with all formations of one sortor another. My fingers went numb and I almost lost consciousness I was so coldand only just thawed out when I borrowed someone’s extra jacket and ateeverybody’s food and after the driver put the heating up full blast for about anhour on our way back to London. The last time I remember being so cold was abouttwenty years ago when I went white-water rafting in Colorado and had my foot inice all day.Polly mentioned that she had fallen on pavement earlier that week and hadtrapped a nerve but that this had healed by the time she entered the formation.None of the others in the group experienced anything unusual.The hypothalamus is a very important part of the forebrain; it lies below thethalamus and forms the lower part of the ventricle and its floor. Its integrityis essential to life, for it is concerned with the “vegetative” functions. Itplays a major part in regulating the temperature of the body, body weight andappetite, sexual behavior and rhythms, blood pressure, and fluid balance, andcan even be said to be the physical basis of the emotions.image [images/9781620558683_093.jpg]Fig. 9.5. The hypothalamus. Many of the effects from crop circles experienced bypeople are a result of activity in the hypothalamus.CLEARING THE HEAD?There are numerous reports from hay-fever sufferers such as one visiting acircle for the first time. She was nervous about going into the 1998 “BeltaneWheel” circle near Silbury Hill as it was in oilseed rape (canola), a plant towhich she was allergic. However she plucked up courage and decided to brave it.“I felt pleasantly light-headed the whole time; my sinuses cleared.” I mentionedthis to my companion, and a young man overheard me and said his sinuses haddried up too. Another man suffering from hay fever found that whereas he hadbeen “streaming on entering the formation” he dried up during his visit.image [images/9781620558683_094.jpg]Fig. 9 6. Silbury Beltane Wheel, near Beckhampton, Wiltshire, May 4, 1998.She was in the formation for some time and felt her throat getting quiteconstricted, despite trying not to breathe in the pollen. Her throat was sorewhen she got home and remained congested for several days. It then cleared andshe has not suffered from hay fever since.A few days later she also went into the Silbury “Scorpion” in the adjoiningfield, and as she was walking in it her fingertips felt as if they were beingburnt by a cigarette or something similar, an intensely hot feeling. She felt sostrange she had to come out.Hay fever symptoms are caused when a person has an allergic reaction to pollen.Pollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle.Pollen contains proteins that can cause the nose, eyes, throat, and sinuses(small air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead) to becomeswollen, irritated, and inflamed.To alleviate these symptoms antihistamine is prescribed. Antihistamines work byblocking the effects of a protein called histamine. They’re available in tabletor capsule form (oral antihistamines), creams, lotions, and gels (topicalantihistamines) and as a nasal spray.We are told that “histamine is a protein that the immune system uses to helpprotect the body’s cells against infection.” The immune system is the body’snatural defense against illness and infection.*9 [9781620558683_ftn.xhtml#ft9]If the immune system detects a harmful foreign object, such as bacteria or avirus, it will release histamine into nearby cells. The histamine causes smallblood vessels to expand and the surrounding skin to swell. This is known asinflammation.The expansion of the blood vessels allows an increased number ofinfection-fighting white blood cells to be sent to the site of the infection.The swelling of the surrounding skin also makes it harder for an infection tospread to other parts of the body.Histamine is usually a useful protein, but if you’re having an allergic reactionit’s sometimes necessary to block its effects. Allergic reactions occur whenyour immune system mistakes a harmless substance, such as pollen, as a threat.The release of histamine causes the process of inflammation to begin and leadsto nearby tissue becoming red and swollen. It can also affect the nerves in theskin, making the skin feel itchy.image [images/9781620558683_095.jpg]Fig. 9.7. The autonomic nervous system.Could the crop circles be acting as antihistamines? I believe that once more weare looking to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is also responsible for theautonomic nervous system (ANS) that affects involuntary conditions such as heartrate, digestion, respiratory rate, salivation, and perspiration.There is a consciousness present in everything around us, the “Gaia”consciousness as described by professor James Lovelock, and in genuineformations, due to their very size and complexity, there is evidence of anadditional intelligence, intent, and focusing.ANNE LEONARD’S ADVENTUREPending receiving the scientific results, I have to tell you that, unusually forme, I found the time spent in the Silbury Hill formation to be wildlybeneficial! This is a teeny bit surprising given the journey back home! A friendhad very kindly agreed to give me a lift to Guildford, whence he was boundanyway, offering to drop me off at the railway station, which was on his routehome. A happy arrangement. Picture my surprise therefore to find him drivinginto Terminal 1 at Heathrow!On reaching Terminal 1, to my surprise, we suddenly shot left, straight down a45-degree slope, not, I think, open normally to the public. This was a sort ofsemi-vertical cul-de-sac. There was, however, a sharp bend [90 degrees] roundwhich, undaunted, our driver swung his car scraping through a most narrowpassage, thereby entering a car park from the wrong end. Coming eventually to abarrier, an attendant appeared shouting what the hell did we think we were doingand this barrier was to let people in, from the other side, and was not forletting anyone out! How had we got in? he cried. Again, undaunted, my friendinformed the varlet he was to LET US OUT whereupon the pole was raised and outwe scudded. Hours later, as I think I told you, we stopped at a hitherto unknown(to me) railway station where, said my friend, “trains might be going toLondon.” I still couldn’t tell you the name of the place. It looked deserted.But eventually a train did come along and amazingly took me to London and thiswas free of charge for there was nobody to pay.Dear, dear. I think I was blessed to get home at all!The feel-good factor is terrific, my energy levels have soared and, moststriking of all, I have suddenly lost weight! Several pounds in fact!(Possibly the journey helped!!!)Love from AnneROCKLEY MANOR: LUCY DISAPPEARSA personal experience occurred after conducting a scientific test in the 1999Rockley formation at Hackpen just below the chalk White Horse. Control testswere to be carried out at Rockley Manor with kind permission of the ownersRichard and Fiona North.I led the way in my car with the scientists following in their car. At theRockley signpost we turned off, and on my right were two splendid stone entrancepillars beyond which was a long curving driveway with parkland on either side,leading to a lovely white Georgian house. Being uncertain if this was RockleyManor, I continued down the lane with the stone wall on my right until coming toa side entrance with two stone posts. As there were no other houses about,clearly this was Rockley Manor.image [images/9781620558683_096.jpg]Fig. 9 8. Opposite Silbury Hill, near Beckhampton, Wiltshire, July 5, 2009. Aformation with arcs and graduated segments, resembling a Greek key pattern.I got out of my car and walked back to the scientists who had drawn up behind meand told them I was going to turn round and go back and drive down the frontentrance. They said they would follow me. I backed my car into a small lane infront of the scientists’ car. I then changed my mind and decided to drive in viathe side entrance. Consequently I drove right across and in front of the carbehind me and expected them to follow.When I reached the house, Fiona‘s charming mother, Lili Millais, came out togreet me. “I am so sorry,” I said, “I have come in the wrong way. I meant todrive down the front entrance at the top of the lane.”Lili looked at me strangely and said, “But this is the front entrance; there hasnot been a front entrance at the top of the lane for well over one hundredyears!”Where were the scientists? At last they arrived hot and bothered. “Where onearth did you go, Lucy, you completely disappeared?”I could not possibly have disappeared as I had been right in front of them allthe time I had been in the lane. Also they were scientists with rational,logical brains so it seems unlikely they should be victims of over activeimaginations or self-delusion.So what is the answer? Where had I gone? Just as I had regressed in time whenseeing the front drive, could my disappearance be explained by my entry intoanother earlier time and place?This apparent lapse of time and space has happened to me on several occasionsand seems quite normal at the time. Also on this occasion I could see thescientists at all times until turning into the side entrance when they werehidden from my view by the wall. Maybe I had inadvertently resonated to the samefrequency as the events of that time and had thus entered another time dimensiontaking my car with me. Rather like Doctor Who and the Tardis!When I asked the scientists for their version of events, they said. “You simplydisappeared; you were there one moment and gone the next. We drove back down thelane expecting to find you at any moment. We searched everywhere.”On a similar vein a bizarre event happened to Ron Russell, a long-time friendand crop circle researcher and enthusiast.RON RUSSELL’S AVEBURY STORYJohn and I went into the “Nested Scorpion” at Avebury Trusloe about 11.30 p.m.on August 11, 1994, the day of its arrival. I was fortunate to fly that day andgot some excellent photos of it, but we had a lot of stuff to do, and wecouldn’t visit it until that night. It was easy to find, and we carefully madeour way into it along the tramlines. I was delighted with the energy I felt.There was a tingling in my feet and legs, and I was about to bliss out. Wewalked a short way into it, and John wanted to meditate, but curiously I did notand conceived of a plan to take flash photos of the centres of the circles,which I proceeded to do, until I ran out of film. “Oh darn,” I thought, “nowI’ll have to go back to the car.” I sent John a strong telepathic message aboutwhat I was up to and went out of the formation to get some more film. I retracedour path toward the edge of the field. I walked and walked and walked but Inever found the edge of the field, and I became concerned as so much time waspassing. I trudged onward knowing that the edge was near (it must be, surely)and the grass grew shorter and the tramlines disappeared and I found myself in astate of disbelief. I looked hard every which way and spotted some flickeringlights in the distance, which I trudged towards, sweating as a result of thislong walk, which I estimated to have been about thirty minutes.As I approached the flickering lights and some intervening bushes, I could seethey were fires. I stopped in my tracks and thought to myself, “They don’t haveopen fires in Avebury Trusloe at this time of night. What has happened to me?Have I gone into some sort of dimensional shift here? And what about thetramlines disappearing? And the air becoming somehow thicker?” I was a bitalarmed and wished that John were closer so I could investigate this with somemore safety, like a buddy system. I slowly walked closer to the bushes, and Icould clearly see on the other side there were two bonfires and several shortpeople milling about them in a sort of a little clearing surrounded by severalthatched huts. “What a great opportunity!” I thought. And as I was about toapproach this scene the thought of being burned at the stake flashed through mymind, and I paused to consider this. “What if I have slipped over to thefifteenth century?” I asked myself. “If I enter their world what are they goingto think of me? I doubt if I would be invited to dinner. This was not a veryopen period in men’s thoughts and beliefs and with my clothing and mannerismsand cameras slung around my neck (without film!) I would guess they would thinkpoorly of me and might harm me as I did not fit into their world.”Slowly I backtracked to get John and enact the buddy system. I followed mytracks through the short wheat and finally came to the faint beginnings of thetramlines I had come down. I followed this for about thirty minutes and at lastfound my way back into the formation where John was standing. “Come with me,John!” I exclaimed. “I have found a time door,” and we proceeded back the way Ihad just come except that we came right away to the edge of the field and thecar! As I explained all this to him and apologised for my long absence, which Icalculated at over an hour (I did not have my watch on), he looked at me in abemused way and said, “Ron, you’ve only been gone five minutes!” I was stunnedand thought he was jesting with me and went over all the details again. He saidthat he had gotten my message and that he had finished his meditation and hadjust gotten up when I returned, which had been about five minutes! We couldnever locate the encampment with the fire. Was I delusional? I thought not, butam at a loss to explain this further.image [images/9781620558683_097.jpg]Fig. 9.9. Forest Farm, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, July 16, 2014.This experience seems to be one more instance of accessing another space, time,and dimension by subconsciously tuning into the same vibrational frequency asthe event.There is also a story told by John from Harlow. He managed to interest a farmerwho took him to a formation on his land and told him to go in. As the farmerstood by the edge of the formation, John asked him if he was coming in too.“No,” he replied. “I am not going in there again. Every time I have been in Ihave needed sixteen hours of sleep.” Sixteen hours of sleep is more than anyfarmer can afford, especially at harvest time!MY TEETH WENT ON EDGEBoth Christopher and his daughter Emily had adverse experiences in the ForestFarm formation, near Marlborough. Christopher told me thatentering the field all felt still and calm as did the approach to the circlewhen within about ten feet of the circle it felt like pushing through mud orwalking through the outer shell of the circle. Once inside to me it felt likebeing in a void. I was unable to distinguish any particular parts of the circlefrom another, but when near the edge there definitely felt to be a lot of energyin a way that I have not come across before. While in the circle two of my teethwent on edge and it felt as if current was passing between the two of them; thispassed when I exited the circle and has not recurred since.As an aside, while in the circle I shut my eyes and let any other informationflood into my head; this is not generally a good move but all that came throughwas that that field would be better suited to cows! I was aware of much moreenergy going on outside the circle than in it.I was aware that Emily wasn’t feeling well where she was lying just inside theperimeter so I dowsed for a more beneficial spot. Emily writes:When I walked into the circle it felt muted and very sheltered, even though thefield wasn’t sheltered at all.Once we were inside the circle I felt quite dizzy, and it felt like my legsweren’t connected to the rest of my body. The left-hand side of the circle mademe feel nauseous and dizzy when I went in it. On a certain spot in the circle Idisappeared from any dowsing.On hearing this James Lyons dowsed the area where Emily had entered. Thereappeared to be a void (torsion field?) at that exact point.When I was leaving the circle, I felt much better than when in the circle, but Icould feel certain sections on the outside of the circle where it felt like mynose was being pinched then released on one side.COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]In considering health effects in crop circles, we have in particular the problemof trying to explain possible mechanisms, which could account for the verysignificant spectrum of effects on individuals. Although crop circles haveacquired a degree of notoriety in this respect, it has to be stated that stonecircles and ancient sites have a long-standing reported history of producinghealth-related phenomena.We have consistently emphasized that the whole of the Cosmos is electrical innature. The most prolific subatomic particles are the proton and the electron.These are the two building blocks of the most common gas in the Cosmos, namelyHydrogen. On Earth, they combine to create the gas we are familiar with. We knowthat it is lighter than air from its former use in children’s balloons.Outside the immediate atmosphere of the Earth, the protons and electrons existin all space in their dissociated form. It is termed the plasma state. Theplasma, or fourth, state of matter is by far the most common state, more commonthan the other three more familiar states of solid, liquid, and gas. Weatherphenomena on Earth, such as lightning and tornadoes, reveal most clearly thisplasma state. Both have significant effects on electrical apparatus.It is now known, but far from accepted, that our Sun is a ball of plasma,sending electric current streams to Earth and, indeed, to all objects in ourSolar System.We know that the grid network of spiraling filaments in space is mimicked withinthe Earth, creating the grid of energy lines on which all medieval churches andancient sites were built. We have discussed the colloquially termed spider’s webpatterns or acupuncture points on the Earth. These are the “graph paper” onwhich crop circles form. Not surprisingly, when crop circles are formed thereremains a swirling cloud of dissociated air. It is a mixture of protons,electrons, and indeed nitrogen, which combines with the air to form nitrates inthe crop. Potentially, nitrogen dioxide could also be formed, which is thepollution component of diesel engines. This, to our knowledge, has never beenmeasured.We turn to the effects of this electrically charged local environment on livingmatter. We have identified the beneficial effects on humans, but what about thedownside? It is well known that in certain stone circles there exist fertilitystones upon which aspiring mothers will remain seated for some time. We knowfrom hormone testing in crop circles that substances such as estrogen arecreated and pass through the root chakra up the cross-wound spinal cord into thehypothalamus and on to appropriate receptors.This effect does not have to be necessarily in stone or crop circles. Some timeago, the media publicized the famous checkout desk in a Warrington supermarketat which ladies wishing to become pregnant were advised to sit because thereseemed to be an electrically-charged environment at that location. From afar, itis clear that, unbeknown to the management, there simply had to be a narrowcolumnar vortex beneath the appropriate cash desk. Its energy-spiralingproperties were such that it imitated the fertility stone-circle effects.Not surprisingly, there is a downside to crop circle energies. To initiate adiscussion of this aspect of crop circle energies, it might be beneficial to saya little about some science that acquired a large degree of notoriety. We turnto one Wilhelm Reich, a medical doctor and psychoanalyst from the first half ofthe twentieth century.In addition to his psychological writings, he also developed a theory of humanhealth based on his discovery of what he called Orgone. The word derives fromorganism and orgasm! In simple terms it is a way of generating, in a so-calledaccumulator, techniques for supposedly curing many conditions, including cancer.However, a version of this device emitted what was called DOR—Deadly Orgone.This proved to have in many cases deleterious effects on patients. Reich endedup in prison as a result his work.DOR is prepared as a state of water. Dowsing the auric field of water in the DORstate immediately indicates its very small auric field. It is, in fact, drawingsubtle energy, life force, or whatever term one prefers, from the body. Thistype of energy spiraling into the body is termed entropic since it draws thelife force from the body.In crop circles, there is a basic balanced energy field in most settledconditions. It emerges from the energy-pattern structure that creates the basiccircle. Appendix 8 describes all this in some detail, but here we only need tonote the fundamental process. From the top of the hemisphere covering a cropcircle there is a nodal point, akin to a pole of a magnet. Needless to say,there is a complementary energy structure below. This is the status quo.However, when a crop circle is being formed, this basic biconical energy fielddoes not have its final geometrical form. It tends to have a very low “slope”angle to this virtual energy pyramid. We now understand that all living matteris far from resonant with this geometry. In fact, the geometry involvedconditions the local space within the crop circle to such an extent that thevortex field motion has rotational frequencies so out of tune with normalitythat physical forces can emerge. Thus crop circle visitors can literally feelthe effects of the rotating force field and, as we have seen on occasions, bethrown to the ground. It is somewhat analogous to being inside an electricmotor!Thus, to summarize the bad effects, we have to recognize that crop circles arethe result of strong physical forces. Depending on when a crop circle isvisited, the remnant electric field can still retain some of its “motor,” andits characteristics are still present."},{"pageContent":"10HISTORY AND FORMATION THEORYMen are disturbed not by things that happen, but by their opinion of the thingsthat happen.EPICTETUS, GRECIAN PHILOSOPHER (55–135 CE)WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY of crop circles, despite the general view thatthis is a modern phenomenon, we find ourselves taking a journey into the distantpast, to the times of our ancestors.Just as many artists painted small, almost unnoticed images of UFOs in theirworks, such as The Annunciation, Carlo Crevelli 1486 (National Gallery), ordescribed an event, dating back to 776 in France, in the twelfth-centurymanuscript Annales Laurissenses, so did our forebears use whatever means theyhad on hand to record what they were actually witnessing in their lives; theserecords went unnoticed until recently.This investigation leads to the wonderfully ancient and stylized Aboriginal cavedrawings. These cave paintings were unknown to the Western world untildiscovered by Joseph Bradshaw in 1981 in an overhanging rock shelter facing theRoe River in Western Australia. Joseph Bradshaw was the first European todescribe this style of Aboriginal art. These figures are known to the NgarinyinAboriginals as Gwion Gwion. Thousands of such cave drawings are to be found inthe Kimberley area. The stylized drawing, sketched by Bradshaw, reveals peoplewearing strange headgear standing near a circular indentation on the ground (acrop circle?), with a kangaroo and a snake shown fleeing the scene in terror.image [images/9781620558683_098.jpg]Fig. 10.1. A scene from the Australian cave paintings discovered by JosephBradshaw in 1981.Zulu holy man Credo Mutwa tells us that there have been equally ancient circlesin Africa dating back some 4,000 years or more in certain arable fields of cornor millet that were considered sacred by the elders. The crop from these fieldswas never allowed to be cut but left as food for the birds.Our investigation takes us to the connections between crop circles, stonecircles, Pythagoras (427–347 BC), and the 11,000-year-old Göbekli temple inTurkey.Six miles from Urfa, an ancient city in southeastern Turkey, Klaus Schmidt madeone of the most startling archaeological discoveries of our time: massive carvedstones about 11,000 years old, crafted and arranged by prehistoric people whohad not yet developed metal tools or even pottery. The megaliths predateStonehenge by some 6,000 years. The place is called Göbekli Tepe, and Schmidt, aGerman archaeologist who has been working there for more than a decade, isconvinced it’s the site of the world’s oldest temple. The geometry found in theconstruction of this ancient temple mirrors the geometry we find in the cropcircles.image [images/9781620558683_099.jpg]Fig. 10.2. The Göbekli Tepe Temple.More evidence can be found at Newgrange in County Meath, on the eastern side ofIreland, which was built around 3200 BCE, during the Neolithic period,particularly the assortment of spiral and circular carvings on the kerbstonethere. Indeed some of the carvings resemble the crop circles found in the fieldsin the early 1990s.There is no overall consensus regarding the use of the site, but it has beenspeculated that it had some form of religious significance due to the fact thatit is aligned with the rising Sun, which floods the stone room with light on theWinter Solstice. Carbon dating revealed that Newgrange monument is older thanStonehenge and the Great Pyramids of Giza. Was it a tomb?Excavations have revealed deposits of both burnt and unburnt human bone in thepassage, indicating human corpses were indeed placed within it, some of whichhad been cremated.Moving forward in time we discover that in his book Hypomnemata Antiquaria,seventeenth-century antiquarian, historian, and philosopher John Aubrey (March12, 1626–June 7, 1697)—after whom the Aubrey stones at Stonehenge are named—wasperplexed by green grass circles on the Downs in Wiltshire. He wrote, “I presumethey are generated from the breathing out of a fertile subterraneous vapour.” Hefurther wrote that “every tobacco-taker knows that ’tis no strange thing for acircle of smoke to be whiff’d out of the bowle of the pipe; but ’tis donne bychance.”Professor Robert Plot published a book entitled A Natural History ofStaffordshire in 1686. In it he makes brief references to rings, circles, andother shapes found in grassy fields. Despite the detail of his writing there isuncertainty as to whether he was describing rings of fungi, known as faeryrings, or genuine crop circles.The 1678 woodcut of the Mowing Devil (fig. 10.3) is probably the most famousrecorded crop circle event of early times. It shows a devil-like person cuttingthe crop with a scythe. The story behind this woodcut tells us of a farmer who,having rejected the price charged by a harvester, stormed off saying he wouldrather let the devil takes his oats. That night he heard strange sounds and sawstrange lights, only to find on entering his field the following morning thathis crop had been cut in round circles, frightening him to such a degree that hetook to his heels and fled. It is thanks to the extensive research conducted byauthor Andy Thomas that we know about this story as he found and read theoriginal—and now somewhat fragile—pamphlet in the British Library.image [images/9781620558683_100.jpg]Fig. 10.3. A woodcut depicting a crop circle (later known as the Mowing Devil)from a publication in 1678.Clearly this was of such importance that it was recorded, and that record haspassed down to us through the ages.During the course of the sixteenth century, King Henry VIII became interested inthe customs of rural England and sent his antiquary, John Leland, on afact-finding tour. In the course of this tour Leland asked the people of Wessexabout their village-green ring dances.“They are so intricate,” he said. “How on Earth do you devise such complexroutines?”“We base them,” came the reply, “on the magic grass designs that appear in ourfields.”Bringing us closer to modern times is a report from July 1880 by John Capron(1829–1888), an amateur astronomer and highly respected spectroscopist. Hediscovered the circles at the Hog’s Back near Guildford, Surrey.The Surrey Advertiser reported his findings at the time and many years laterthey were published in the respected scientific journal Nature in 1880 andreprinted in the January 2000 issue of the Journal of Meteorology (ISSN0307–5966: Volume 25, pp. 20–21: “A case of genuine crop circles dating fromJuly 1880—as published in Nature in the year 1880”).The storms about this part of Surrey have been lately local and violent, and theeffects produced in some instances curious. Visiting a neighbour’s farm onWednesday evening (21st), we found a field of standing wheat considerablyknocked about, not as an entirety, but in patches forming, as viewed from adistance, circular spots.Examined more closely, these all presented much the same character, viz., a fewstanding stalks as a center, some prostrate stalks with their heads arrangedpretty evenly in a direction forming a circle round the center, and outsidethese a circular wall of stalks, which had not suffered, I sent a sketch made onthe spot, giving an idea of the most perfect of these patches. The soil is asandy loam upon the greensand, and the crop is vigorous, with strong stems, andI could not trace locally any circumstances accounting for the peculiar forms ofthe patches in the field, nor indicating whether it was wind or rain, or bothcombined, which had caused them, beyond the general evidence everywhere of heavyrainfall. They were suggestive to me of some cyclonic wind action, and mayperhaps have been noticed elsewhere by some of your readers.In the 1930s, crop marks are mentioned twice in Sussex Notes and Queries, thejournal of the Sussex Archeological Society.In August 1932 it was reported that three dark rings about 40 yards in diameterand part of a fourth had been noted in barley on the lower southern slope ofStoughton Down near Chichester.In October 1936 a lecturer on “Archeology from the Air” suggested crop marksnoted that year could be indicative of ploughed out ditches of large barrows. Helooked forward to other sites being revealed by aerial photography.Several pilots during World War II reported flying over crop circles in thesouth of England. These were investigated by M15 fearing that they might becodes left for German pilots.In 1963 a strange crater appeared in a field in Wiltshire that puzzled renownedastronomer Sir Patrick Moore. He attributed the crater to be of possiblemeteoric origin and sent a comprehensive report to New Scientist on August 8,1963, which alerted both the press and the public.In describing his inspection of the crater, Moore incidentally mentions severalunusual circles of flattened wheat in fields adjoining the potato field in whichthe crater had appeared. At this time the term “crop circle” had not beencoined, and there was no real public interest in crop circles as such; however,there can be little doubt that Moore was describing crop circles.UFO NESTSAustralia too has had its circles. In 1974 there was a report of a circlemeasuring around twenty feet in diameter, which was discovered in a large fieldof saffron thistles in the Goolagong area in the Bathhurst District.Diana Kearns, who sent me this story, had been awarded a grant by the AustralianFilm Commission; she was studying the possible correlation between UFOs and gridpatterns/systems, ancient Aboriginal stone rows or stone circles in the UK,connected with the ley line system.Just before Christmas 1974, she was telephoned by the UFO Society regarding thiscircle (or UFO nest as they are called in Australia). In Australia distances ofup to two hundred miles are considered close by, so off she hurtled and was metby the farmer, Viv Huckel.The field of thistles had been plowed up at the request of the AustralianBroadcasting Commission, which made it a considerably less painful journey forDiana. “These thistles are as thick as the hair on a dog’s back!”The farmer, Viv Huckel, recounts:What hit me when I first saw it was that it was very similar to nests found inthe sugarcane beds up in Queensland. I drove around, finished plowing and cameback and had another squizz at it. What intrigued me was that the center portion(about four foot across) was almost completely bare, and after that you startedgetting little stumps of saffron thistles—they’d been shredded. The further yougot to the perimeter, pieces of stalk were just broken up; but the last coupleof feet of thistles—and these are two feet high minimum—were completely knockeddown in an anticlockwise direction, twisted up, and some had been torn out bythe roots. It’s pretty hard to pull a green saffron thistle out by the roots,mate!The theory that animals might have squashed down the thistles was discounted byViv, who had only had five head of cattle in that paddock in the previous sixmonths.“Like their female counterparts in the human race, they like their creaturecomforts,” said Viv. “They wouldn’t go and bust down a camping site in thesethistles, nor would sheep.”A whirlwind or “willy-willy” was also ruled out for “if anyone has seen an oldman whirlwind, they’d know that it doesn’t stay in the one spot. It sweepsstraight through a paddock and leaves a dread straight scar of knocked-downthistles, say, all heading in the same direction.”Thistles are a hollow-stemmed crop, and like oilseed rape, the stalks will notlie flat and remain flat when bent to ninety degrees. In experiments it wasfound that it is necessary to bend them in excess of ninety degrees and applypressure. When this was tested, the stems simply snapped. Also the stalks bruisebadly, and scars are visible if any mechanical weight is applied.The accounts of circles or UFO nests in sugarcane are even more amazing. Havinglived in Jamaica for twelve years, I am very familiar with the behavior ofsugarcane. It reacts in a similar way to both thistles and oilseed rape, butgrows considerably taller, to a height of eight to nine feet, and it isextremely heavy. What force as yet unknown to man could cause this gargantuancrop to bend to its will without causing any crop damage or broken stems?Ron Gaist, a Sydney television executive, took aerial photographs of adiamond-shaped clearing in a cane field near Tully. A Queensland Universitystudy failed to find any explanation for the way the cane stalks had been pulledout by the roots and swirled into a mat about ten meters across, indicating themovement of some object. Willy-willies were again discounted, also crocodiles,“the ‘nest’ being too neat.”Another strange thing happened when the film was developed. “A bank of lights”appeared in several of the aerial photographs. Ron Gaist had no idea they werethere until he had the film developed. The objects were not visible to the nakedeye. Nor were they a fault in the camera because they did not appear on the restof the film or in photographs taken before or since.Ron Gaist also ruled out the likelihood that the markings were caused by sandridges in the cane fields. “Sand ridges don’t run in geometric patterns,” hesaid. He believed he had uncovered new evidence of strange aerial phenomenon inQueensland’s famed flying-saucer belt. “Now I’d like someone to tell me whatI’ve photographed.”There is an Aboriginal legend that one of their gods, Chic-ah-Bunnah, was unlikethe other gods, as he symbolized no other known living thing. He was shaped likea man. As he sped through the air he gave forth a blue light so dazzling no onecould look upon him without being blinded. He ate glowing red coals and took offfrom the Earth with a frightening bang and a roaring noise.Ron Gaist relates that an airline pilot has drawn up an electromagnetic gridsystem based on reported UFO sightings and that Tully lies at an intersection ofthis pattern. The belief that there is a connection between UFO sightings andflattened ground patterns is increasing.In the UK in 1984 a design incorporating five crop circles suddenly appeared onthe front page of a national paper, the Daily Mail. The reason for theunprecedented publicity was not so much the circles themselves but the celebrityof the photographer, Labor MP Denis Healey, now Lord Healey of Riddlesden.Returning over the South Downs from his usual Saturday morning shopping inSeaford, East Sussex, he was amazed to see a single circle of about forty feetin diameter surrounded by four smaller circles equidistant from each other andthe center of the circle. Then Mr. Healey, a well-respected amateurphotographer, rushed home to get his camera and recorded the formation.A few more formations appeared in the 1980s, but it was the 1990s that saw theappearance of many more circles and an increasing public interest in thephenomenon.An interesting one in Warwickshire, on July 9, 2009, was the tetrahedron thatwas found with the apex of the tetrahedron pointing directly at the ChestertonWindmill near Hanbury. Famous as a landmark, the windmill has had a prominentposition above the village for nearly 350 years.Thought to have been built in 1632 by lord of the manor, Sir Edward Peyto, thewindmill could have been designed by a pupil of Inigo Jones, John Stone. Peytowas a mathematician and astrologer, and as the windmill had a rotating top it ispossible it might have been built as an observatory, with the rotating topacting as a station for Peyto’s telescope. Later it became a working windmillgrinding corn.After giving my annual talk in Petersfield in October I was interested to meetone of Peto’s (modern spelling) descendants who had been unaware of thisforebear’s links to the windmill and was delighted to know more.Close by was the Radford circle. It now seems likely that unusual atmosphericconditions of lowered pressure are part of the process of the natural forcebehind this phenomenon.CROP CIRCLE NUMBERS WORLDWIDE 2018COUNTRYCROP CIRCLESAfghanistan2Argentina12Australia 199Austria14Belgium75Bosniaand Herzegovina1Botswana 2Brazil 35Bulgaria 3Canada 362Chile 1China 4Colombia2Croatia 7Cyprus 1Czech Republic 231Denmark 46Egypt 3England 3,668Finland13France 58Georgia 1Germany 473Hungary 25India 5Indonesia 4Iran 1Ireland12Israel 13Italy 245Japan 26Kazakhstan 1Kenya 1Latvia 4Lithuania 1Luxembourg1Macedonia 1Malaysia 3Mexico 16Netherlands 480New Zealand 18Nigeria 1Norway41Peru 4Poland 86Portugal 1Puerto Rico 1Romania 3Russia 35Scotland 12Serbia4Slovakia 13Slovenia 11South Africa 7South Korea 1Spain 11Sweden 24Switzerland79Turkey 2Ukraine 8United States 433Uruguay 1Wales 13Yemen 1Total 6,861Information courtesy of Bertold ZugelderCOMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]The concept of Natural Healing in an environmental context is far from new. Mostpeople can understand the magic of the countryside and Nature as a whole and itsimmense benefit to us and our physical, mental, and emotional being. We tend toconsider the Sumerian period of around 400 BCE as a time of evolution of theHealing Arts. As we shall indicate, recent historical investigations haverevealed a rather different perspective. This perhaps focuses more on the YogicPeriod, circa 6000 BCE.As far as science is concerned, this is truly the period in India revealing howMan and indeed all animals were an integrated evolutionary part of Nature. YogicScience was the truly initiating factor that offers us a bridge from ancient tomodern science. It is interesting to note that the first symbol of Man’sconnection to Nature is embedded in the Sri Yantra symbol. This nine-pyramidalemblem of Man’s connection to Nature has only recently been resolved from amathematical perspective.The concept that the Cosmos was and still is the all-pervading, self-organizingfield of energy is only now starting to be seen as the supposed Higgs field fromwhich all material objects, including ourselves, emerge. This long-awaitedperspective integrates ancient and modern science. Even the concept of the bosonparticle, which describes the nonmaterial world, is now beginning to be seen asthe pseudo-particle, which accounts for the mental or conscious processes of theCosmos.As indicated in many places in this book, it is not the force of gravity thatholds the Cosmos together, it is the electric force generated by spinningelectric charges. These in turn are best modeled mathematically as closedstanding waves around a virtual toroid. This in turn forms a dipole field notunlike a battery.The Electric Universe model emerged from Hannes Alfven’s research of the 1970s.It is these spiraling waves that interact with both halves of the brain andindeed with the auric shell surrounding the body. We owe it to Yogic Science foridentifying the chakra systems of the body. It is not surprising therefore thatcrop circles mimic our body chakras as well as, at the cosmic level, theGalaxies.Healing techniques based on concepts such as acupuncture, Hands-onHealing,Reflexology, Reiki, Kinesiology, and so forth, are popular today since approvedmedical processes based on pharmaceutical products rely only on materialtechniques. The drug-based approach often has severe side effects, as we arewell aware.Crop circles are in fact the Earth’s Chakra Systems, so being in a formationexposes one to the immediately local spiraling energies. These are essentiallyelectrical in nature and most generally emerge from the Earth. As we are likesponges in the ocean, we are exposed to these columnar spiraling energiesthrough our bodies. This is the same nonmaterial bosonic energy that ourforefathers were most acquainted with.Chinese medicine has embraced the idea of using the nodal points of the body asentry points for corrective insertion of appropriate signals. The whole processis somewhat like tuning an orchestra. If the body is harmonically tuned to a keyfrequency, then every body part plays its part in tune. A healthy person is onetuned to a common frequency.We all know that orchestras need to tune up prior to a concert. In these days itis the oboe that holds this task. The realignment to a frequency of 440 Hzremains a bone of contention. The earlier Vivaldi period tuned at the slightlylower frequency of 432 Hz. This difference is noticeable to a learned audience.There is no doubt that the tuning of the spiraling columnar energies emergingfrom the Earth resonate with the cells of the body.We should conclude this section with the observation that our forefathers, wayback beyond the Yogic Era, were well aware of Earth healing. In recent years ithas been discovered that natural volcanic hills have a common conic geometry,leading to pyramidal forms whose geometry relates to the Golden Ratio. One ofthese, the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun, possesses many in-built tunnels showinghealing properties. The British Museum analysis of organic remains in thesetunnels revealed an occupation date of 34,000 BCE. Thus the healing propertiesof such structures have a long history.Human interaction with the Earth’s ambient energy fields dates to thousands ofyears before our recent turning to the healing properties of Earth Energies. Weare at long last beginning to understand how the frequency spectrum of ambientvertical energies can have dramatic effects on our health, both good and bad."},{"pageContent":"11CONCLUSIONimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]This Elusive and Timeless EnigmaAll truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it isviolently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER (1788–1860)I WONDER WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED as we have continued our journey through theseexamples of crop circle healing and its associated mysterious horizons? Has thismultilayered phenomenon spoken to us, and on what path might it be leading us?Can we say that, as a result of our current understanding of this uniquephenomenon and its events, and as our research continues apace, it hascontributed to the development and expansion in certain new aspects of science?Indeed we have come to understand more about the physics of the Universe and howthey function and interact with the electric world in which we live and of whichcrop circles are a part. This is a phenomenon that rattles the brain, leaving anindelible impression on our psyche.I am very aware that my knowledge and broad understanding have outpaced anyprevious learning of the past twenty-five plus years. Over the twenty-five yearsin which I have been involved in my “hands-on” investigations in this subject, Ihave become aware that it is a subject of scholarship, incorporating allbranches of learning—ranging from all the sciences, music, farming, theology,history, ancient wisdom, customs, traditions, geography, and last, but certainlynot least, art. How far one wants to venture into this university of endless andfascinating information and wisdom is entirely a personal matter.Unexpected doors and windows have been opened in my brain and mind—sometimestaking me by complete surprise as a sudden realization of understanding burststhrough into my consciousness.Hopefully this book has answered many previously unanswered questions regardingthis elusive and timeless enigma expanding our horizons and leading us on tofurther investigation.However, as the river of time has flowed by, I have now reached the conclusionthat there are things that can never be fully explained. When I was very young,so young that I could not yet read, I was shown a book in which there weremarvelous colored birds with trailing feathers and adornments such as I hadnever seen before. On enquiring I was told that they were Birds of Paradise.“Are they real?” I asked. “Yes, they are real,” was the reply. “Where isParadise?” Answer came there none.My sister and I didn’t see much of our parents (as was usual in those days),except for an hour in the evening when we were spruced up and taken downstairsto the library. We were in awe of our parents, and so this was the mostnerve-racking part of our day, and it took me several visits before I was ableto summon up enough courage to ask my parents if they knew where Paradise was.Again, no answer. This was a severe disillusionment, as I had firmly believedthat grown-ups knew everything, and this was the third time a grown-up had notbeen able to give me the answer. So I resolved that when I grew up I would findParadise and take everyone there to see the exquisite and mysterious birds! Mysecond fascination was with the Loch Ness monster, followed by Einstein’s Theoryof Relativity; next came Infinity. This was a real problem, and for many years Isimply couldn’t understand why at some distant point in time and space Infinitydid not become Finite! AND then came the crop circles—what a bother they were,almost the worst of all, and how were we ever going to find out about fromwhence they came and who or what was the originating force behind them?Now, after years of questioning, searching, and researching, I have realizedthat despite our knowledge of this subject having increased quite exponentially,there are certain questions—including those about crop circles—that can NEVER beproperly answered. I have become perfectly content that there is an elusive,ineffable quality to them. Having realized this, and being quite comfortablewith this realization, Infinity and other conundrums no longer bother me! What arelief!A learned friend of mine wrote, “People travel the world to see the cropcircles. Crop circles are the biggest thing that most people never experienced;a historic phenomenon. In a future time, people will look at these and wonderwhy they weren’t headline news in our time—but then, we live in a strange andmad time, and many of us believe that the formations, and the energy fieldsinside them that can’t quite be encapsulated in photos, point to another time. Atime when we will understand them, using the archive records.”COMMENTS BY JAMES LYONSimage [images/9781620558683_109.jpg]Turning to conclusions, it is now becoming obvious that mainstream science ischanging rapidly. There is considerable recognition that the current assumptionsabout such things as the Big Bang, Dark Matter/Energy, and so forth, areseverely flawed. Gravity is a leftover force when the main source of energy,electricity, is balancing out its positive/negative charge.The Electric Universe model is growing rapidly in significance. The latest workwas presented recently in the Electric Universe Forum. Now we have exoplanets,that is, Solar Systems that are nothing like ours. The planets are still jumpingorbits, so we have, for example, Jupiters located in orbits like Mercury.What we are learning from crop circles is enormous. This includes the relevanceof the geometries, the creation process, namely toroidal vortex flow, and,highly applicable to this book, the energy’s frequency harmonic structure andits relation to spiraling subtle energies (left/right brain) and, mostspecifically, the brain frequency structures that are key to healing.The two key words are implosion instead of gravity, which has everything to dowith columnar vortices, and cymatics, which are responsible for the combinationof frequencies determining patterns."},{"pageContent":"> image [images/9781620558683_101.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTSThe nature of God is a circle of which the center is everywhere and thecircumference is nowhere.EMPEDOCLES (490–430 BCE)OVER THE YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN relatively few credible reports of peopleactually witnessing crop circles being formed. Many people have claimed theyhave seen these events, but on closer scrutiny, their stories have not beensubstantiated.However, there are four accounts that have successfully withstood criticalexamination, and these are included here for the readers’ interest.The first event took place in the Lincolnshire fen land in 1947. Frederick Smithwas working on a farm.I was eighteen at the time. The month was April and the weather was very good,just nice and a gentle breeze with no planes in the air at the time.Suddenly a sound like “the gentle humming of bees” was heard. When the circleswere laid down the noise was a high-pitched buzz, which seemed to come from faraway. The circles were formed in about three minutes. I felt faint, and thenpassed out.When Frederick recovered some three hours later he found that the crop of greenoats, only six or seven inches high, was already rising up undamaged.For Frederick to have fainted for so long would seem to indicate a rapid loss ofair pressure surrounding him as when an airplane has to dive sharply and oxygenmasks are needed.GIANT PASTRY CUTTERThe second account comes from retired aircraft engineer Ray Barnes. In additionto being possessed of a logical and analytical mind, Ray is also a keen observerof Nature.One afternoon he was going for one of his regular walks above the town ofWestbury, Wiltshire, to a field where over the years he has witnessed manystrange events taking place.On this particular day, July 11, 1981, while walking his dog after athunderstorm, Ray reports:My attention was first drawn to a wave or line coming through the cereal crop.After traveling across the field in an arc, the “line” dropped to the ground andradially described a circle in a clockwise direction in approximately fourseconds.There are several points to make about the line.(a) It was invisible.(b) There was absolutely no wind, and the line exhibited no fluid tendencies,that is, the speed was constant, no wind waves before or after it.(c) The line just appeared; there was no disturbance of hedge or trees at thefield boundary.(d) Estimated speed of the line was about 50 mph.(e) There were no visual aberrations in front of, above, or behind the line.(f) The line almost disappeared where the ground dipped, so it would seem theline was maintaining a constant height irrespective of ground contour.(g) The crop heads only “jiggled” not bent, which would seem to indicate thatthe line had holes in it like the teeth of a giant comb or that the line wassufficiently weak for the cereal heads to pop through it when the pressure onthem reached a certain level.Barnes tells us that the circle was described radially, not diametrically, andat a constant speed.The circle was executed in a single sweep. “The peripheral speed of the circleseemed to be about twice that of the line/arc speed. The crop in the circle wentdown as neatly as if it had been cut by a giant flan cutter. There wasabsolutely no spring back, which was rather awe inspiring as, if you watch atractor crossing a field, there is always some spring back of the flattenedcrop.”Barnes subsequently developed an unusual form of cataract that he attributesdirectly to observing the crop circle appear.WE FELT TINGLY ALL OVERThe third event took place on the outskirts of Hambledon, a small village inSurrey, on the evening of Thursday, May 17, 1990.Gary and Vivienne Tomlinson had been for one of their regular walks up to thetop of Byrony Hill. It was an unusually humid day—hot and sticky—and evening wasapproaching, and the Sun was setting. The air was still as they walked down thehill and across the fields toward home.It was not until they were crossing the second wheat field that they noticed thewind blowing the crop. Looking back toward Byrony Hill the wind was so strongthe trees were bending over. In a matter of seconds a mist appeared and rolleddown the hill into the field where they were standing. It was like a shimmeringwhirlwind. They could hear the noise of the wind, intensifying to a high pitchlike a set of panpipes. The noise was so great they looked up to see if ahelicopter was overhead.Suddenly there was a gust of strong wind pushing us from the side and above. Theshimmering air circled around us. It was forcing down hard on our heads. Wecould hardly stand upright. Yet we also felt as if we were being sucked up atthe same time. There was tremendous pressure both from above and below. We bothfelt tingly all over, like pins and needles from head to foot.I tried to break free from the grasp of the whirling air but found myselftrapped. I looked toward Gary; his hair was standing on end [Gary tells me thatVivienne’s hair was also standing on end]. I tried to call out to him, but myvoice seemed to get lost in the volume of noise as we were spun and swirledaround. Suddenly the wind scooped us off the path into the wheat field. We tooka great buffeting. It was very frightening.Looking down we saw a circle being formed around us. It happened so quickly; itonly took a couple of seconds. A spiral appeared anticlockwise and grew outwardfrom the center. [Vivienne estimated the circle to be about two meters indiameter.] In the center of the circle there was a small pyramid of wheat, thestalks stacked up against each other. The whirlwind split into two, one goingwith a whir into the distance, skimming over the top of the wheat as it went. Asecond whizzed past me to one side, pushing down the wheat and then forming asecond circle a little further away. This again only took a few seconds. Welooked around for the first circle and could still see it like a lightshimmering mist as it zigzagged into the distance over the top of the wheat.Interesting things were happening in the circle in which we were standing.Miniature whirlwinds were appearing one after the other, small, glisteningvortices perhaps four inches apart. They whirled around the wheat in smallbunches toward the perimeter, gently laying the crop down and enlarging thecircle. There was no wind now, and it seemed strange watching these shimmeringwhirlwinds as they spun around. They seemed to increase in number. We bothlooked toward the second whirlwind; it looked like a transparent glowing tubestretching up endlessly into the sky.The sunset was beginning to fade. I turned my attention back to the miniaturewhirlwinds. They seemed to have lost their misty look, now appearing more likewatery glass with a quivering line inside. They wobbled slowly, still runningalong the wall of the circle. There also seemed to be fewer of them. It wasgrowing dark.I panicked, grabbed Gary’s hand and pulled him out of the circle. Slowly we madeour way back in silence, stunned by the event. My ears ached, and we both feltlethargic and nauseous and were suffering from shock.Neither Gary nor Vivienne were wearing watches at the time. They estimated theduration of the episode to have been approximately seven minutes, whereas itseemed to last an eternity.Vivienne’s ears were so painful that she visited her doctor, who diagnosedperforated eardrums.There is little doubt that witnessing a crop circle appear before your very eyesis a traumatic event.THE STONEHENGE JULIA SET 1996This most remarkable event only came to light thirteen years after it hadhappened. It is noteworthy for several reasons; a pilot flying a light aircraftfrom Exeter to Thruxton flew over the field opposite Stonehenge on the afternoonof Sunday, July 7, with a passenger taking photographs, at which time the fieldopposite on the A303 was unmarked. The pilot disembarked at Thruxton, completedthe necessary landing and flight forms, refueled, and then got back into thesame plane to fly back to Exeter. To his great surprise when flying over thesame field opposite Stonehenge some forty to fifty minutes later he observed anenormous formation measuring 915.2 by 508 feet imprinted in the wheat below. Agamekeeper and a guard at Stonehenge both confirmed that it had not been therethat morning.The formation was named the “Julia Set” as it represented complexcomputer-generated fractal image to the mathematicians, to musicians a baseclef, and to marine biologists the cross-section of a nautilus shell.Veteran researcher Colin Andrews related how the formation was first spottedfrom an aircraft at 6:15 p.m. The pilot crossed over the field with a passenger(a medical doctor taking photographs) at 5:30 p.m.There was nothing in the field at that time butwhen the pilot returned at 6:15 p.m. he saw the formation in the field. At aboutthe same time (6:30 p.m.) his previous passenger drove past Stonehenge to seecars pulled off the side of the busy road.When I interviewed the Wiltshire police I was told that the police emergencylines received several 999 calls just before 6:00 p.m. reporting a large numberof vehicles pulled off the road causing a hazard.German researcher Andreas Mueller has also supplied some vital information as aresult of having visited the formation shortly after its appearance. He hadlistened to a man he took to be the farmer telling a group of people that he hadhad farm workers working in the field mending the fence until approximately 5:30that afternoon.Surely this is one of the most important events in the history of the cropcircle phenomenon, as rarely do crop circles appear during daylight hours.image [images/9781620558683_102.jpg]Fig. A1 1. The Stonehenge Julia Set, near Amesbury, Wiltshire, July 7, 1996.THIRTEEN YEARS LATERAfter giving a talk at Alton College in Hampshire in 2009, a friend telephonedme to say that someone she knew had been in a taxi and had told the taxi driverthat she had just been to a fascinating talk on crop circles. (We will call thetaxi driver M, as she was fearful of the publicity if her name were ever madepublic knowledge.) M replied, “I saw one appear opposite Stonehenge.” Thinkingshe meant this year, my friend telephoned me but after making extensiveinquiries, I realized that there was no circle anywhere near Stonehenge. I wasgiven M’s telephone number and told her what I had heard. “O dear me, no, it wasyears ago.” I mentioned that up to 2009, only three formations had appearedclose to or opposite Stonehenge, 2002, 1997, and 1996. “It was 1996, as my son,who was in the army, was on holiday, and I was driving down to see him.”I eventually managed to arrange a mutually convenient date to meet M and get herstory on tape.M and Tim (her son’s friend) were driving to Somerset in July 1996 to see herson who was in the army. Driving down the hill toward Stonehenge she saw a lotof cars pulled off on the grass verge on the A303 opposite the stones. Shementioned that when people see maybe two cars or more pulled in and looking downinto the field, other cars stop and gradually the traffic builds up and more andmore cars draw in to have a look.As she drew nearer Tim said, “Mrs. M, there’s a crop circle there.”A car drew out and she managed to pull into the empty space and got out andjoined the crowd of other people who were also watching what was happening.There was an apparition, an isolated mist over it, and as the circle was gettingbigger the mist was rising above the circle. As the mist rose it got bigger, andthe crop circle got bigger.There was a mist about two to three feet off the ground, and it was sort ofspinning around, and on the ground a circular shape was appearing, which seemedto get bigger and bigger, as simultaneously the mist got bigger and bigger andswirled faster.It was gradual and you are standing there and you are thinking what is going onand everyone is discussing it and more and more traffic is building up andeverything and you just think that all the time you don’t really realize what ishappening and then you think then that’s it and the thing is getting bigger andyou are thinking of the beginning and end. But you don’t realize what you arelooking at. I didn’t understand what was happening.The mist wasn’t anything from the ground as there was a clear space between theground and the mist. There was no wind and no dust [she is an asthmatic]. It wasthe strangest thing I have ever seen. It was a calm summer’s day.When I asked her how long she stayed looking at the event, she said it was hardto say, but maybe twenty minutes or so, but she couldn’t say as she had losttrack of the time as she could not believe what she was seeing and was watchingthe event, not looking at her watch. The mist was still there when she left butwhether the formation was still expanding she couldn’t say.What color was the mist? Well it wasn’t brown or blue or pink; it wasn’t comingoff the ground. And it didn’t go far up into the sky.I asked her, “Did you feel strange?”I felt, My God, what is going on, look what’s happening, are we going to see aleprechaun or the men from Mars or a Sputnik in a minute or something?I asked M which date it had appeared she thought a bit and then took my pad andwrote Sunday, July 7, 1996. She said she remembered this particularly as being aSunday; she was driving against the traffic. She asked me, “Why haven’t youheard about this before? There were so many people watching what was happening,not just me. Why didn’t the other people talk about it?”Indeed it was only by chance that I got to hear about it some thirteen yearsafter it happened due to a passenger in M’s car who had been to my lecture!M hadn’t mentioned it herself except to her family and friends.On leaving M, I was puzzled by the time element of approximately twenty minutes.I could not budge M on this; she was adamant and insisted that that was what shehad witnessed, and nothing I could say would make her change her mind. The otherthree reliable reports I have had of people witnessing crop circles appearinghave all quite independently mentioned that the circle took between four andtwenty seconds to happen. So why had this one taken so long? Was it due to thefact the other circles had just been small single circles whereas this one waslarge and complex?On returning home I immediately telephoned James Lyons who was particularlyinterested in the cloud hovering above the circle, which he had always felt waspart of the formation’s creative process. Regarding the time element he asked meto send him the measurements and number of circles.As a result of work conducted in the 1990s, it is possible to calculate the timea formation takes to appear based on the size and number of circles. The methodrelates to the Earth’s gravitational and magnetic fields. This predicts avelocity of the resulting vortex filament of some 10 feet per second. Thefilament propagates not unlike a solar flare, repeatedly looping through theEarth’s surface “embroidering” a gradually evolving pattern. To create the 151circles in the 915.2-by-508-foot pattern would take of the order of twenty totwenty-five minutes to create.The descending force emits an electrical discharge, which releases bubbles fromthe underground aquifers, which rise up through the surface of the ground andpatterns are formed. The anchor point of the force is always off center.This aspect has been observed many times over the years in certain complex cropcircles.These patterns develop like “embroidery,” half above the ground and half underthe ground in a sort of looping manner.There is significantly less pressure inside than outside, therefore there is asort of sucking motion from inside which bends or “sucks down” the crop at thebase.This drop in pressure was also illustrated by a report I was sent by LynnJenkins of Obrenpovac, Serbia, when visiting a circle at Radford, Oxfordshire,in 2009.It was windy as I walked toward the circle. Once inside the circle there was nowind, although nearby trees were moving. It was also very warm inside thecircle. The conditions were cloudy and windy.The mist would appear to be as a result of cool water vapor rising from theaquifer [underground spring] beneath and behaves in a manner similar to whathappens in the lab when electrical discharges are created through water anddifferent patterns emerge on the surface. Mist forms a little distance from thetriggering point, which would support what occurred in this case. M could seethe circle growing. It is when the hydrogen atoms recombine that all thishappens as this draws in ambient energy. This is where the excess energy appearsfrom. As for height, it would be no higher than the radius of the formationcreated, and the mist cloud would grow as the formation grew.However, the more complex patterns have additional information contained in thesphere and who or what presses the button to make these is not within ourpresent knowledge or understanding.Indeed not only does it appear that M was correct in every aspect but it alsocorroborates the report by the pilot, the guard at Stonehenge, and thegamekeeper. It was a truly remarkable event.Why did M and the other people who witnessed this event not report it?I suggest you put yourself in their place—while watching this extraordinaryscene as a group is one thing but as soon as you drive away, maybe you couldstart to wonder if it had really happened at all, and you would have to be avery brave person to go into your local pub and tell everyone about it for fearof ridicule.Many strange things happened to people visiting this formation, especially tothose visiting the formation shortly after it appeared.I visited it on July 9, 1996, and was strangely reluctant to enter, and someinstinct made me turn back after walking halfway down the field. Two friends,who were with me, continued into the circle and experienced extreme nausea thatonly cleared after they walked some distance away from the formation.More reports of nausea and severe fatigue were to flow in from visitors to theJulia Set.Nausea and severe fatigue after 10 minutes [in the formation] until 8:00 p.m.that evening. I had to lie down and slept for two hours.The most extreme account came from a young scientist.Felt mentally flat, unable to think or remember what I had done minutes before.Felt very similar to feeling of intense ultraviolet radiation or gammaradiation, both of which I am familiar with as a molecular biologist working inthat field. Experienced initial nausea. [The effect lasted] all day until I wentto sleep. Several hours later [I] experienced intense physical well-being andmental clarity."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2THE EFFECTS OF CROP CIRCLES ON OUR BRAINSWHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN crop circles and electromagnetic fields?Many people are researching the damaging effects of the electromagnetic fieldsemanating from radio masts; also there is a growing amount of literature andresearch into the beneficial properties of pulsed EMFs (electromagnetic fields).Genuine crop circles are not randomly placed; they adhere to strict geophysicalprinciples. The planet has a crisscrossing network of lines, some of which actas power points in the landscape.Beneath the surface of the Earth’s crust there is almost as much activity as inthe heavens. Things are constantly moving around, to a greater or lesser degree,scraping against and colliding with each other just as the tectonic plates growand slide over one another, creating electromagnetic fields and releasingpent-up gasses as they jostle, resulting periodically in earthquakes or volcanicactivity.In addition, the enormous pressure on rock crystals produces powerful localelectrical fields, measuring several thousand volts per meter. When this actionoccurs, “luminosities” may result.Studies by Michael Persinger, a professor of psychology and neuroscience atLaurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, led him to believe that there is aconnection between earthquakes, electromagnetic fields, unusual brain activitysuch as visual hallucinations, and paranormal events such as UFOs.Our ancestors understood and were sensitive to these “energies” in a manner thatmany of us have lost in this highly technical world. Small shrines oftendeveloping into churches and temples were built on such places—Stonehenge,Avebury, Chartres Cathedral, and the Pyramids to name but a few.There is increasing scientific evidence allowing us to make a connection betweenmechanical failures and seismic activity. It has been noted that car accidentsoccur at notorious black spots shortly before an earthquake or volcanic eruptionanywhere in the world. These black spots are almost invariably located on“energy” lines. The survivors will often report that a local, familiar, straightroad suddenly had a sharp right-hand bend ahead, while others will report seeinga nonexistent tree just before the accident happened.There is an emerging body of opinion based on over twenty years of fieldinvestigation coupled with mathematical modeling that now recognizes the natureof the forces involved in crop circle formation. We now understand that thebasic effect is founded on longitudinal electric waves, consistent with relatedgeophysical phenomena such as lightning discharges. It is this triggering effectthat releases the stored energy from underground water sources. The result isthat the crop is drawn down to the ground by localized below-ambient pressure.More details of this process are described in James Lyons’s prologue[9781620558683_fm.xhtml].There is also a wealth of evidence from different scientific disciplines showingthat “energy” lines affect us in many diverse and bizarre ways. How we react tothese is individual in manner.BRAINY BRAINSThe brain is the most complex organ in the human body and the least understood.It is the control center comprising a hundred billion nerve cells that respondto eddy currents, and their effect and stimulation will depend on where theenergy enters and its amplitude (field strength).The brain weighs approximately three pounds, and despite the fact that it isonly 2 percent of our body weight it uses 20 percent of the body’s oxygen. Thebrain has two hemispheres, and there is a crossover effect, the right braincontrolling the left side of the body and vice versa.There are three principal parts of the brain, the particularly sensitive brainstem, the cerebellum, and the cerebral cortex. Each of these three areas isresponsible for specific functions and the control of different activities. Thebrain itself does not feel pain.image [images/9781620558683_103.jpg]Fig. A2.1. The brain.Do we only use 10 percent of our brains? How much of our brain do we use?John Henley, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, tells usthat although it’s true that at any given moment all of the brain’s regions arenot concurrently firing, brain researchers using imaging technology have shownthat, like the body’s muscles, most are continually active over a 24-hourperiod. Evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of the brain. Even insleep, areas such as the frontal cortex, which controls things like higher-levelthinking and self-awareness, or the somatosensory areas, which help people sensetheir surroundings, are active.Do our brains regenerate themselves? At one time it was thought that our brainscould not regenerate. However, it is now understood that the neurons (nervecells) in our brain are being constantly replaced and repaired naturally, evenwhen we are adults. This process is called neurogenesis, and much research isbeing undertaken in this area, focusing with particular interest on sufferers ofParkinson’s, Huntington’s, and Alzheimer’s disease.Owing to the number of effects listed in the mental category, I am going toexamine this aspect alone.The part of the brain known as the brain stem is the area most affected by themajority of the following reports. The reaction to these effects, drawn fromvarious sources of neurological literature, can be shown as a spike of between18 and 18.5 Hz in the beta level of brain activity. The brain stem is located onthe top of the spinal cord. It deals with important functions that keep usalive. It automatically controls our breathing, heartbeat, blood pressure, andcirculation.A PRESENCEBelow are several examples taken from responses to the questionnaires, letters,phone calls, and personal experience. We begin with the sense of a presence.People often describe a place as having its own particular atmosphere, adistinctive quality unique to itself. In ancient days this was referred to asgenius loci, an intelligent, protective spirit whose duty it was to live in andact as a guardian of the location. How it came to exist in a particular spot isconjectural; some suggest it was formed due to some magical event or as a resultof energy lines. Could the genius loci be held responsible for the followingreport or was some other additional, unknown, and unseen quality present at thetime?A group of people from the Midlands visiting the 1993 Bythorn formation inCambridgeshire were sitting and meditating in a circle inside the formation. Thereport sent in by one of the participants said,I sat next to John, and after a few minutes I was aware of someone walking upthe tramline behind me and sitting down and joining us. Afterward, John turnedto me, “Where is the person who sat down behind us?”John and I both independently heard someone approach but did not hear anyone getup and leave; the woman who had been sitting opposite us said that at no timehad anyone joined the meditation.The final area of discussion is “disorientation and memory loss” together with alack of concentration and altered states of consciousness.These effects outnumber all others in the questionnaire responses, and I believethey are due to a pull to the right cortex of the brain that is experienced bymost people when entering a genuine formation. This pull makes performing anyscientific task extremely difficult, as the concentration level and logicalthought needed to accomplish the job is hard to achieve, let alone maintain forany length of time.Many are the times that I have had to go back and repeat measurements andreadings; and many are the reports I have had from researchers who have simplygiven in to superior odds and left their analytical work for another day. Attimes these effects also involve severe headaches.In 1996, I decided to bury my bottles of water in a huge linear event named theDNA formation at Alton Barnes. Out of eighty-nine circles how should I selectwhich ones to use? I found I was unable to count correctly beyond five. Time andtime again, to the amusement of those present, I got to five but then jumpedforward or backward out of sequence.At last I realized what was happening: the “Inability to Count” syndrome thatafflicts so many people when trying to count the stones within stone circlessuch as the Rollright stones in Oxfordshire where, to this day, I don’t believeanyone has been able to count them correctly! I certainly haven’t, despitetrying on several occasions.While inside the circle, Shelly Keel initially found that she was unable to drawthe shape of the formation in her notebook.I couldn’t get myself together enough to walk and draw the thing till justbefore we left. I had many goes at it but I just couldn’t get it right. Afterabout 1½ hours of trying I gave up for a while. When I drew it up just before Ileft, I realized I had been walking the same part over and over again. That waswhy I was unable to get it right. When I realized what had been happening it allcame together quite easily.In 1995 friend and colleague Keith Wakelam, a retired electronics engineer andauthor of many books, including Discovering Eternity, came with me to Wiltshireto help bury my small brown bottles of water.It was a glorious early summer’s day in June. We parked in the lane adjacent tothe field and with the farmer’s permission entered the field and made our waytoward the formation.MUDDLED MINDSWe entered the spiral, and then our problems began; we had the greatestdifficulty finding our way to the center. Succeeding at last, I buried a bottle.We were both using our dowsing rods, which behaved in a most strange andinexplicable manner that neither of us had ever previously experienced. Keithfelt uncomfortable as though he was “being drained of his essential life force.”I also started to feel very ill with the onset of a migraine (I am a migrainesufferer but now only get them when under extreme stress and that certainly wasnot the case that beautiful sunny summer morning). I started to feel sick anddizzy and experienced flashing lights. Keith was also getting worse and worseand was in a dreadful state. He too is an occasional migraine sufferer. He wasexperiencing flashing rainbow lights, his peripheral vision had gone, and he wasfeeling most unwell. We crawled out of the formation, and made our slow andhalting way back to the car, where we sat like two heaps, unable to think ortalk.After a while Keith felt well enough to drive, he reversed the car and came backonto the main A40 Calne/Beckhampton road. It was not for a few minutes that Irealized that something was amiss. I tapped Keith on the shoulder, “Do yourealize you are driving on the wrong side of the road?” I asked.We stopped for lunch at Stones restaurant in Avebury before attempting ourfamiliar journey home. That was not so easy either; twice we got lost on the wayback having taken a wrong turn. It was clear that we had lost all coherentthought, and we were thoroughly disoriented. Keith recovered after abouttwenty-four hours; I did not feel back to normal for several days.Experienced crop circle researcher Christopher Bean was particularly taken withthe 1999 Windmill Hill “Square.”I could not get the formation out of my mind until I’d got back to Bournemouthand had drawn it on graph paper. It took me three attempts to get what is infact a rather simple formation onto the paper properly.I had counted each circle in the formation and drawn it into my notebook in realtime as I walked the lengths. I found that there was a rhythm between mycounting each successive circle aloud and the steps I was taking. Betweencircles 12 and 13 on each side, I had to walk two to three steps before 13 andcontinuing on to 24 (the number of circles along the flanks). From this I knewthere was a gap of standing crop halfway down each side, which the aerial shotshave illustrated.I could recite or recall the formation easily but this didn’t stop me makingcountless errors when drawing it at home. I kept wanting 12 circles per sideinstead of 24. A full day later I realized what I was doing wrong and finallymanaged to draw it correctly.LOST IN THE WOODI am much indebted for my final account to Norwegian Eva Haagensen, who onceagain describes a loss of time when going into crop circles.I was in England last summer in different crop circles. I was in a group withJohn Gursli, and one in the group also had a PC. One evening John showed me anew crop circle. I felt a very, very strong energy from the picture on the PC.It was so strong that I could not look at it. It was a waving cross if youunderstand me. After I saw it on the PC I knew it was very important for me tocome inside the crop circle.John took us there the next day, and we went inside and I lay down inside it.After about twenty minutes I stood up again and I felt I had to go out againbecause it was so strong the energy that must have come inside my body. I wentout and I decided to go back to our bus. But something had happened to me so Iwas not able to find the bus on the other side of a small wood. I went insidethe wood to try to find the path. I do not know what happened to me in therebecause when I came out again I thought I had been there only a few minutes butit was an hour.When I came out again I was totally alone. I saw nobody so I had to call forhelp from the others in the group. I was not able to find the way on my own. Thestrange thing was that I never before brought my telephone into the crop circlesbut this time something said I should bring it. So they found me, and I wentback to the bus and I felt very strange. It was like I had a very heavy helmeton my head and that feeling was there the rest of the day.After that I had a sort of energy in my head for five weeks that very often mademe dizzy. I also want to tell you that I am a very sensitive person. I hope youcan understand what I have written to you. My English is not perfect.So what conclusion can we draw from these reports? It would appear that thecombined effects of the residual electromagnetic energy found inside the circlestogether with the local geomagnetic activity are creating neurochemicalreactions that are as yet not fully understood. Research is ongoing to determinethe causes."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3THE ASYRA TECHNIQUE (QEST4)DIRECTOR MARK CONRAD LEADS the Asyra team. With a previous career in informationtechnology, and ten years’ experience at the helm of NutriVital Health, his rolebrings together the combination of energy medicine pioneer, natural healthclinic, and nutritional products company that stands behind our unrivalledexperience in this field. He writes that:The Asyra software contains digitally-encoded information relating to a widerange of mental, physiological and emotional factors. The signals are output bythe Asyra hardware as electromagnetic signals during testing. Using a simple andsafe low voltage circuit formed by holding two brass cylinders, the response ofthe body to those signals is recorded. The response being measured is smallchanges in the electrical resistance of the skin. This information is relayedback to the software.Running an Asyra test is an example of a process that we call bioenergetictesting. Bio-energetic (or just “energetic”) testing is effectively “asking thebody a question” and obtaining the response directly from the body’s ownphysiology, without engaging the conscious and language centres of the mind.The functioning of the human body is governed by informational signals. Some ofthese, such as the instructions for making proteins encoded in DNA arerecognised by modern science. The epigenetic factors—how our experiences in lifeaffect gene expression—are just beginning to be understood. It is likely thatthere are many other communication mechanisms at work that have yet to beexplained scientifically. Biology is a very young science. The existence ofcontrol mechanisms beyond genetic determinism is not seriously disputed bymodern science, but its implications have not filtered through to medicine inpractice. This is a result of resistance to change and because it is not yetclear how to employ the knowledge in systematic treatment programmes. When weobtain responses from a bioenergetic testing device, the information is amixture of commentary on the physical, chemical, emotional and mental state.Indeed, part of the skill of the practitioner of bioenergetic testing is toconsider the information that comes from the system and decide how to recommendan individualised health and wellness programme.Is the Asyra a diagnostic device? “Diagnosis” is derived from a Greek wordmeaning to “discern or distinguish.” Asyra testing does indeed “discern” only inthat it records a completely individual set of responses to signals. This mayassist a holistic practitioner in the approach that is characteristic of suchdisciplines: “treating the patient, not the disease.” Information obtained maysupport you in making a traditional diagnosis, if that is something you aretrained and licensed to do.The one definite and unchanging aspect of interpreting the test results is asfollows: if an item shows up as unbalanced (usually a red or yellow indicationagainst the item in the displayed list), then that signals that among thepotentially hundreds or thousands of items tested, the body gave an above orbelow average electrical resistance response.In different words, the body-mind system has indicated some kind of reaction tothe item being tested, and along the lines of homeopathic treatment, we can usethat to “remind” the organism to improve that particular aspect of homeostasis.Consider a parallel from immunology: introduction to a pathogenic microbeinitially causes a disturbance to the body, perhaps quite a serious acutereaction. However, as the information is relayed around the immune system, thebody learns to cope with that particular pattern better next time.The Asyra test is identifying items to which the body/mind system can learnbetter adaptive behaviours. These items may be as diverse as foods, pathogens,emotional patterns, colours or nutritional and pharmaceutical agents.https://www.facebook.com/asyrasystems [https://www.facebook.com/asyrasystems]https://twitter.com/AsyraUK [https://twitter.com/AsyraUK]mark.conrad@nutrivital.co.uk [mark.conrad@nutrivital.co.uk]"},{"pageContent":"> image [images/9781620558683_104.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 4GRID LINESWE NEED TO EXAMINE THESE electrical spiraling grid lines in a little moredetail. The centerlines are double helices possessing a spiral angle of 36degrees. They are, in fact, double helices resembling Slinky toys with adjacentspirals moving in opposite directions. This arrangement is just like the DNAwithin every cell of our bodies.Where they cross over, a third, similar vertical spiral emerges. This is thecenterline of a wider column of again spiraling energy, which aligns with theexternal circle of the acupuncture spider’s web pattern.Outside this central line system are single directional spiral lines, againSlinky-like but having a spiral angle relative to the line’s flow direction ofarcsine (1/3) = 19.471 degrees. This type of line is called a tetrahelix line,first discovered by Buckminster Fuller. In church architecture, these often formthe lines defining the edge of the church transept. These are the type of linesthat reverse flow direction at Solstices and Equinoxes.Outside these lines are the edge lines, usually one-half the distance from thecenterline to the tetrahelix lines. These outer lines are, in reality, thelocation of the tube of energy in which these line structures occur.It has already been stated that electricity flowing within the Earth can berelatively easily measured. In fact a simple digital voltmeter connected acrosstwo probes of differing metal such as brass and iron will register a few volts.Perhaps more convincing is to dowse the tetrahelix lines to find a null point,that is, a point where there is no apparent source of current and where thebattery’s presence cannot be detected. Move it just a few inches in anydirection and not only its presence is revealed but also its conical vortex.Electrostatic voltmeters are often used in crop circles, but knowledge of thespider’s web pattern and associated energy lines is needed to reveal theintricate underlying skeletal energy structure. All this knowledge has been lostby modern-day architects despite it having been known for thousands of years."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 5TELLURIC CURRENTSA TELLURIC OR EARTH CURRENT is an electric current that moves underground orthrough the sea.Telluric currents result from both natural causes and human activity, andalthough discrete, these currents interact in a complex pattern. The currentsare extremely low frequency and travel over large areas at or near the surfaceof the Earth. Telluric currents are phenomena observed in the Earth’s crust andmantle. In September 1862, an experiment to specifically address Earth currentswas carried out in the Alps near Munich.The currents are primarily geomagnetically induced. They are induced by changesin the outer part of the Earth’s magnetic field and are usually caused byinteractions between the solar wind and the magnetosphere or solar radiationeffects on the ionosphere.Telluric currents flow in the surface layers of the Earth. The electricpotential on the Earth’s surface can be measured at different points, enablingus to calculate the magnitudes and directions of the telluric currents and hencethe Earth’s conductance.These currents are known to have diurnal characteristics wherein the generaldirection of flow is toward the Sun. Telluric currents will move between eachhalf of the terrestrial globe at all times. Telluric currents move equatorward(daytime) and poleward (nighttime)."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 6DOWSINGTHE ENERGY STRUCTURE of the Cosmos is such that when it manifests matter, itdoes so using just a few processes but in a very elegant way, such that thecosmic structures we are familiar with can be readily dissected to reveal theiroverall construction. This applies from the subatomic world up to galacticstructures.However, when we consider living matter we are invoking both mind and matterworking in harmony.The Cosmos is formed of billions of structures we term Galaxies. They congregatearound nodal points in space, which resemble whirlpools in terms of function andare so-called Black Holes.All Galaxies are connected. The energy field that permits this is electric innature and is in the fourth, or “plasma,” state of matter. It represents wellover 99.9 percent of the matter in the Cosmos. We are familiar with the plasmastate in the form of, for example, lighting in kitchens and supermarkets.Plasma is composed of atomic matter in a separated state, that is, the particlesof electric charge “float” around the nucleus of the atoms they are associatedwith.In the Cosmos, all Galaxies are linked by networks of filaments of freeelectrons, which form helical structures across space. These filaments aretermed Birkeland currents. They form networks of filaments not unlike a form ofroadway system in which roundabouts are Galaxies and the connecting roads areBirkeland currents, slinky-like structures identifying a central line of theroad as well as its gutters and grassy edges.Galaxies, when mature, create conical spiral structures emerging from thegalactic center. These arms contain Solar Systems, making ours but one ofbillions.These same Birkeland filamentary structures surround the Earth and create themagnetosphere. It is not surprising therefore that a similar network of electricfilamentary structures was involved in the creation of the Earth itself. Thusthe Earth too is electric with a network of what we term telluric currentswithin and below the Earth’s surface.Since, as mentioned, dowsing can readily detect anything that spins or rotates,it has no problem detecting this road-like network of current. Humankind hasknown this for millennia.These underground currents interact with all animals, including ourselves, onlyif we ask for a link. This is the basis of dowsing. Distance is no object indowsing, but we must be extremely pedantic as to what we ask. The process isanalogous to finding a specific word in, say, a book. If we have the right book,we next ask for the chapter, then the page number, then the paragraph, then theline, and finally we can hone in on a word, say, the name of someone.Since the Earth’s surface is in reality a hologram, we have in principle noproblem finding what we need. The crossover points of these line networks,oriented to magnetic north and running north-south and east-west on the Earth,occur in a two-dimensional mimic of a Galaxy. We call these Spiders’ Webs sincethey most often consist of six nested circles with eight radial lines. All ofBritain’s thirteen thousand medieval churches were built on these crossoverpoints, and usually the altar is located over the point. All this knowledge hasbeen largely lost; modern church architects plead ignorance of this most ancientknowledge. Needless to say, all stone circles are built on these nodal points.These networks of lines are produced below the Earth’s surface by an energysource, which is triggered by an electrical discharge from above. The bubble ofenergy, toroidal in shape, breaks through the surface acupuncture point. Whenthe toroid—rising like a hot air balloon that has lighter air within it thanoutside it—breaks the surface, it collapses (implodes) in a very organizedfashion, thereby drawing down the crop in its characteristic swirl of simply acircle.How do we dowse this? It is just like dowsing a church or stone circle; werespond to the stored spin energy that created it all. By programming ourthoughts we can even focus on one stalk of grain, indeed one seed, if we sodesire. As in auric healing, some trained healers can determine what is wrongwith us by our aura; we, in dowsing the crop, can measure the auric size of eachseed if we need to. We now have a mathematical method whereby we can convertsuch readings into real energy measures such as joules per cubic meter.In summary, humans, by means of their spiral DNA structure, which possesses thesame helical angle (36 degrees) as we find in Earth Energies, resonate with whatwe are investigating. We simply ask and withdraw the information we need. Wehave evolved to be in every part of the Cosmos informationally.The spiraling energy is key to healing. It resonates with our DNA, which in turnlinks with every cell of our body. We are, in effect, tuning in to, say, thecorrect frequencies for Parkinson’s syndrome. The ambient energy fieldpenetrates every cell, selecting the frequencies needed. This is how dowsingworks in general and the crop circle effect in particular."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 7MUSIC AND GEOMETRYTHE UNDERLYING HARMONIC STRUCTURE of crop circles is based on the diatonicscale. The fundamental concept of musical scales goes back to Pythagoras. Heevolved a numerical table called the lambdoma that involved ratios based on thenumbers 2 and 3. Modern mathematics uses this principle in so-called modulo-9arithmetic. Unlike in school where we learn to count from 1 to 10, the mod-9system counts from 0 to 9. In this more universal procedure, we also embody thenumber 1. Simply: 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 6.Thus the two basic concepts we learn, namely arithmetic and multiplication,unite at the number 6.This occurs everywhere in, say, chemistry. Thus, it is not surprising to findthat the latest material to appear—graphene—is a carbon ring with 6 sides, thehexagon. We are now finding that this simple approach of the sequence 0 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 contains key numbers 3, 6, and 9.Whereas the number 2 describes the material world and matter, the number 3describes the mind world. This approach unites everything in science fromGalactic levels down to subatomic levels such as the 3 quarks making up aproton, the basic unit of the quantum world.Thus we begin to see how number can yield geometry. In music it is the diatonicscale that prevails. Our brain waves start to become noticeable at around 8 Hz.Why is this? It is simply that light propagates around the Earth at just under 8Hz (7.83 Hz). If we investigate brain-wave frequency when, say, dowsing, thewave band spreads from approximately 8 to 14 Hz.This lower limit is termed the “Schumann resonance.” So starting at thisfrequency and going up in octaves, we have 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and soon. Now, it just so happens that 256 Hz is middle C, known to all pianostudents. The octave with its eight white notes divides the frequencies intoharmonic ratios. On the piano, these are tuned to equal temperament, which meansdividing the scale into equal ratios with the lower note being 0.891 thefrequency of its neighbor.The key number of the Cosmos governing all materialized forms is 2. In musicthis is termed the octave, which is found at cosmic and quantum levels. Thinkingof the octave on a piano keyboard, we know that between the notes C and upper Cof the octave there are twelve semi-tones, the seven whites and five blacknotes. The frequency ratio of the adjacent semi-tones is 1.0594 corresponding toa tone ration of 1.12233445566. . . .We find that the number 2, along with its companion prime number 3, is foundeverywhere in the Cosmos, from the largest galactic structures down to thequantum scale. They govern all patterns in the living and material world and arepresent in the I Ching. It is therefore no surprise to find both numbers in thecrop circle world.We find this diatonic ratio scheme everywhere in crop circles when we measurethe separation of adjacent lines or, indeed, the radii of nested circles. Inpassing, it is interesting to note that the familiar discus shape of some matureGalaxies retains this fundamental ratio in successive rings. Indeed, simplydowsing the energy pattern around a common object such as a pepper pot on thekitchen table yields the same harmonic structure.The result is that the diameter of the overall dowsable geometry of any commonobject shows that its ring-structure diameter is some nine times that of thedowsable aura of its central sphere.There are so many other properties of the musical scale to be identified.Perhaps the most important one is the ratio of C to A, a so-called major sixth.Again we see the importance of this number. This note A is used to tuneorchestras, with the first oboe undertaking the tuning procedure. Before 1953,this note was 432 Hz—note that the numbers add to 9. This tuning was defined bythe mezzo-soprano/soprano voice range dating back to the era of Vivaldi andVerdi and the rise of opera.What is so important is that this value is a key number in Quantum Physics.Division of 432 by a small correction to Pi, the ratio of the circumference of acircle to its diameter, yields the famous number the Fine Structure Constant,which for reference has the value 137.036. It has everything to do with wavestraveling in a spiral motion in a circle, which is the basic way that cropcircles are formed.THE WILTON WINDMILLThe Wilton Windmill formation embodied a unique feature verifiable as a keyelement of mathematics. Unlike the Pi formation of 2008, which embodied a keynumber we all learn at school, this one codified an equation.Although the codes presented, namely the ASCII codes, used universally totransform one’s keyboard symbols into a string of ones (1) and zeros (0), theerrors displayed in the field presented a tantalizing puzzle. First there weretwelve radial lines representing the codes of each of the equation’s symbols, asseen in figure 5.6 [9781620558683_c05.xhtml#pg74] and in figure A7.1 below. Itis seen that where there are code lines present, that line represents a 1 (one),and no line a 0 (zero). However, for each radial there is the complementary code(exchanging 1s for 0s and vice versa anticlockwise of each radial).These lines form their own codes, which, in fact, are pure integer numbersranging from 200 to 300-plus. It turns out that the average of these is 274 andthis, it happens, is twice the number 137. As mentioned earlier, in QuantumPhysics this is known as the Fine Structure Constant, arguably the mostimportant number in this branch of science.image [images/9781620558683_105.jpg]Fig. A7.1. Wilton Windmill, near Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, May 22, 2010.image [images/9781620558683_106.jpg]Fig. A7.2. A diagrammatic representation of the Wilton Windmill crop circle.Also, since there are eight symbols in an ASCII code, this reminds us of thediatonic scale (white notes on the piano), which we find everywhere in EarthEnergies. Thus each radial has a left- and right-hand code (scale sequence)associated with it. Playing these “tunes” on the piano, however, did not turnout to offer very inspiring music!A recognizable equation only emerges when its first symbol is aligned with thewindmill. Reading the codes on the clockwise side of each radial revealsLeonhard Euler’s famous Euler’s Identity Equation, well known to mathematicians.Within this equation one finds Euler’s number having the value 2.7183. . . . InEarth Energy investigations the key number 2.72 feet emerges and is foundthroughout all ancient sites and crop circles. This length is known as themegalithic yard."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 8THE STONEHENGE JULIA SETTHE JULIA SET FORMATION (fig. A1.1 [9781620558683_c12.xhtml#pg205] is unique inseveral ways. Formed in July 1996, it was created on an Earth-acupuncture pointin the same Earth Energy complex as Stonehenge itself. As noted, itsmidafternoon creation was in full sight of wayside observers who viewed thelaying down in total of some 192 circles, starting from its center and spiralingoutward toward its periphery. A cloud was observed to hang over the formationwhile the emerging pattern formed beneath. These observations in themselvesconfirmed the fact that crop formations were capable of being created by MotherNature.Photographic evidence later revealed the startling pattern that had been laiddown. In principle, despite consisting of simple circles, the arrangement of thecircles in both location and size revealed clearly the sequential fractal natureof the creation process. This is entirely consistent with what is seenthroughout the Cosmos. The overall impression indicates a strong connection tomusic, resembling remarkably the universal bass clef symbol. It has been seenthat throughout Nature reference to harmonic scales is widespread, being readilydistinguishable through quantum to cosmic scaling. Again the diatonic scale isprevalent—in this case the relative scaling of adjacent circle diameters revealsthis underlying process.We are now in a position to describe the pattern formation in more detail basedon the universal descriptions of the creation of toroidal waves. The overallformation is “housed” in a hemispherical dome whose walls are Langmuir doublelayers. This dome is created from the expanding shell of energy emerging fromthe initial discharge to the underground water blind spring. Within this is theexpected toroidal ring having a central hole that defines the center circle ofthe formation. This in itself is a central columnar vortex reaching to thehemispherical energy shell above. This forms a Hannes current circuit as per theubiquitous form found throughout the Cosmos. The toroid hosts a toroidal wavewith a winding ratio of unity. Unlike a toroidal wave, which has a wave with afilament of constant diameter, this formation utilizes a filament, which islinearly conical in shape. It is this narrowing property that dictates the sizeof the individual circles decreasing in size as the spiral length increases. Itis seen that for up to near one azimuthal rotation the major circles aredecreasing as dictated by the conical “embroidery threading” vortex filament.Beyond this first 360-degree rotation, it can be seen that the sizes of thecircles decrease in a linear progressive manner. This occurs since the conicalvortex has reached its maximum diameter and starts to decrease in width, thusaccounting for the progressive reduction in circle size. Thus the creationvortex filament is, in fact, of a very long biconical form. Its symmetrical formaccounts for the overall spiral length. Since this structure is universal in allthe plasma physics we see, it is more than comforting to find the Circle Makersusing this same concept, thus indicating most explicitly the universalprinciples of cosmic construction.We still need to address yet one more question, namely, the myriad smallercircles spreading on both sides of the main circle sequence. Studying again thetoroidal wave model, it is the spirals-upon-spirals concept that gives the gameaway. These are the way in which we model higher-dimensional space. The idea wasfirst observed by Leadbeater in his Theosophical studies of the universal atommentioned earlier. In this case, for each major circle there are three smallercircles on either side. The farther away the circle is from its much larger hostcircle, the smaller it is. This overall arrangement indicates in two dimensionswhat we are seeing in the model in three dimensions. This clue to higherdimensions is crucial to our emerging understanding of higher dimensions inQuantum Physics, particularly the current key model describinghigher-dimensional space known as M-Theory."},{"pageContent":"FOOTNOTES*1 [9781620558683_c02.xhtml#fr1] See Global Scaling by Andreas Beutel (Munich:FQL Publishers, 2008).*2 [9781620558683_c04.xhtml#fr2] See Ablaze!
