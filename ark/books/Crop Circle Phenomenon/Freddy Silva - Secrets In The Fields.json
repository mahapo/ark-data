[{"pageContent":"Image [images/MyCoverImage.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Silva, who has worked in graphic design and advertising for most of hisprofessional life, conveys his keen passion for earth mysticism in this probingexamination of crop circles. He examines the history of crop circles, humaninteractions with them, their probable implications, and, in a section that isalone worth the price of the book for supporters, their effects on our currentworldview. Silva also delves deeply into the evidence for crop circles'authenticity. In arguing that they are transhuman events, he discusses the roleof electromagnetism and its effects, UFO phenomena and their relation to cropcircles, the relationship between crop circles and healing, evidence supportingpsychic ability, and language's ability to affect information consciously andsubconsciously (this section is sure to stimulate those who suspect that cropcircles are a hoax). Readers may be inspired to reexamine preconceived ideas, asSilva's explanations are detailed and well researched and avoid technicaljargon. Footnotes and an extensive bibliography encourage further exploration.Recommended for psychic phenomena or metaphysical and New Age collections inpublic libraries, and for collections including contemporary works oncontroversies in science and mysticism.—Leroy Hommerding, Library JournalAs a long-term croppie it is sometimes difficult to get excited by a new book oncrop circles. No such problem here; the book is an easy, yet comprehensivesurvey of the entire crop circle scene; concise, yet thoroughly satisfyingarticles on all aspects of the phenomenon. . . .It has something for everyone interested in the crop circle mystery,light-hearted at times, intensely serious and intricate at others, a book youcan cut-and-come-again to. It has an enormous number of illustrations, some incolour, far too many to count, but I reckon in the region of 180!—George Bishop, The CircularFreddy Silva's Secrets in the Fields marks the maturation of crop circle study.It feels almost like a field guide, since it focuses on the visualcharacteristics of the formations. As a graphic designer, Silva has anappreciation for the “draftsmanship” of crop circles, and he helps the studentwith his silhouette renderings of the circles. Gathering the most spectacularexamples from the last ten “seasons” and presenting them side by side inschematic silhouette fashion, they appear as an uncanny symbolic language.Silva's day job is to create symbols that easily and unambiguously speak to thebroadest range of “consumers”; yet he tackles these highly ambiguous andesoteric symbols with equal skill. A beautiful selection of color andblack-and-white aerial photographs give the book a coffee-table splendor, butSilva also includes close-up, ground-level photos that show how the large-scalegeometry of the figures is a result of precise architectural arrangements at amuch smaller scale.—Kevin Dann, OrionIn Secrets in the Fields, researcher Freddy Silva, who's based in Wessex,England, considers why and how the crop circles might have the effects they doon their beholders. Silva has made a fitting selection of b&w and colour photos(many are his own) plus diagrams which he uses with riveting effect. He exploresthe historical data, scientific evidence, geometries and symbolisms, and talksto fellow researchers and individuals whose lives have been touched by them.While Silva, like other researchers, can only speculate on the identity of theCirclemakers, he leaves us in no doubt that they exhibit a high degree ofintelligence and demonstrate a profound grasp of universal mathematical andgeometrical principles. He exposes the hoaxers and debunkers, and enlightens usto the beautiful mathematical proportions embodied in the cereal creations andtheir relationships with sacred landmarks, ley lines and even the local guardianspirits. Silva taps into the “acoustical alchemy” that is integral to theshapes, and he shows how the designs have resonance with the symbols of ancientcultures and secret societies. He also investigates the theories that music andsound, light and microwave energy are involved in their creation. The hummingsounds, light columns, moving light balls and electromagnetic interferencereported by many witnesses all add up to important circumstantial evidence.—Ruth Parnell, NEXUSThe text is very thorough and provides one of the most extensive analyses ofcrop circles that I have ever read. Analysis of the history of crop circles isexhaustive as is the analysis of fraudulent crop circles and mathematicalrelationships within crop circles. . . . A detailed and fascinating read, Iwould highly recommend it to anyone interested in crop circles.—James A. Cox, The Midwest Book ReviewThe result of Silva's research is a book that makes bold to grasp the mystery ofthe crop circles through the competing methods and worldviews of both scienceand mysticism. Secrets in the Fields is possibly the most comprehensive andgraphically beautiful book yet written on the circles, providing basicinformation needed to assess various approaches to understanding this complexphenomenon—and more. Extensively referenced, it has the best bibliography of anybook on the subject now in print, a testament to Silva's ability to linkseemingly disparate fields of inquiry.All of the controversial aspects of the phenomenon are covered in depth: reportsof flying balls of light and UFOs; pathways of energy reported for centuries bydowsers (“ley-lines”); the relationship of crop circles to underground sourcesof water; and the remarkable consistency of many circles' geometric patternswith ancient mysticism—the same principles of harmony and proportion used tobuild the Parthenon, Chartres cathedral and found throughout classical Islamicart.—Ed Conroy, Express-NewsAresident of Wessex, England, the author takes us on an exhilarating firsthandfield trip into the heart of the mystery. We journey to the scene of the enigma,before, after, and during the appearance of a fresh circle. Silva introduces usto farmers, researchers, scientists, mystics, hoaxers, and debunkers.

P. BlavatskyFive hundred feet above the rolling Wiltshire countryside in southern England,pilot Graham Taylor and his passenger take in an unhindered view of theprehistoric monuments that pepper the landscape below. At precisely 5:30 P.M. onthis wondrous July afternoon, the single-engine plane and its occupants glideeastwards above the sarsens and bluestones of Stonehenge, one of the ancientworld's greatest feats of engineering.Below, the conjunction of Sun, summer, and Sunday has brought the tourists outby the hundreds. They mill around the monument, ringedin by the wide perimeterfencing and several security guards. Some of these guards keep awestruckvisitors from wandering off the beaten track; others survey the surroundingfields from their high vantage points for signs of more enterprising, nonpayingattendees. It's a typical working day for tourism, and pilot and passenger soakup the whole spectacle, bird'seye style.Minutes later, after a textbook landing at a nearby airfield, the two men partcompany. The passenger, a doctor, begins the drive home. Coincidentally, thedrive entails passing Stonehenge again, this time at ground level. But that willnot be happening quickly today: The A303 London-to-Exeter road has come to acomplete standstill. Moreover, many drivers have abandoned their cars and arelining up on the edge of a field that borders the road. An accident? People arepointing at something in the field, some are taking photos.It is now 6:15 P.M. Within a forty-fiveminute window some phenomenon hastransformed the area into a chaotic sideshow. Something has arrived that hadclearly not been there when the two men had first flown over.When aerial photos of the site make the evening papers they hypnotize the world:embedded in a pristine sea of wheat lies a sprawling impression of 149 circles,varying from one to fifty feet in diameter (see figure 0.1 on page A1 in thecolor section). The precision and the symmetry of the pattern's curving spinemeasures a colossal 920 feet long by 500 feet wide.Most startling of all, the wheat has been swirled and flattened, with theplants' stems bent horizontally just an inch above the soil, and they areundamaged.These sightseers are gazing at a crop circle—in this case, a stylizedrepresentation of a computer-modeled fractal pattern named the “Julia Set.”All this has occurred in broad daylight barely two hundred yards from awell-guarded tourist attraction, and yet nobody was seen creating the cosmicartwork. Further investigation reduced the construction time frame to minutes,the clues coming from a sharp-eyed Stonehenge guard who noticed the formation,fully complete, in between one of his punctual, fifteenminute rounds, and from asecond pilot who had flown overhead a quarter of an hour after Taylor. The localgamekeeper, too, had inspected the field that morning and seen no disturbance.Was it possible that a group of human beings, skilled in both advancedmathematics and environmental art, had mastered the principle of invisibilityand flouted the laws of gravity to levitate above the untouched wheat in orderto create this masterpiece?If only the stones of Stonehenge could speak.Indeed, if only the thousands of other ancient sacred spaces throughout theBritish Isles could, for they have played silent witness to the thousands ofcrop circles that relentlessly manifest in their vicinities. What strangeattraction exists between these symbols etched on a canvas of plants and thecircles of earth and stone, many of them erected eight thousand years ago underthe guidance of forgotten Neolithic “gods”?Whatever the connection, the early Roman Catholic Church recognized theimportance of such places of veneration to the degree that it issued ordersoutlawing their use, only later to superimpose its own houses of the holy uponthem. For, as it turned out, these pagan megalithic shrines are not locatedhaphazardly upon the landscape, but strategically, at the crossing points of aninvisible—but measurable—electromagnetic energy grid that encircles the Earth—atpressure points where the planet's “data storage” can be accessed.Or influenced.At these terrestrial points, the veil between worlds is thin, and theconcentration of energy is such that it influences the rhythms of the humanbody, right down to its state of awareness. Consequently, for many millennia,both the sick and the shamen interacted with these energies, whose propertieshave recently been recognized by science.However, around 1600 years ago this contact with the natural world began to takea long turn. With the later assertion of the Inquisition, seventeenth centuryrationalism, and, finally, materialism, the transcendental purpose of the sacredsites became blurred. They fell into disuse, became shrouded in superstition,and, like batteries drained of energy, they inevitably shut down.Then in the late twentieth century, the mysterious crop circles beganmaterializing with increasing frequency beside these ancient markers, likesignatures from the “gods,” returned to awaken a giant, sleeping network at apreappointed time. Crop circles have been shown to possess energetic propertieswhich are not only interacting with the sacred sites, but they are reportedlyhealing the people passing through their space and facilitating heightenedstates of awareness.Image [images/pxiii-01.jpg]Figure 0.2 Top: The heart of the mystery. The plants of genuine crop circles areswirled like the spiral of a galaxy, and bent just above the soil, withoutdamage. Bottom: By comparison, man-made crop circles generally create a mess.What peculiar force is at work here? How does it create these curious patternswith the plants bent above the soil, their stems lightly scorched as if overcomeby a short, but intense burst of heat? Under the microscope, even their cellularstructure has been altered—hardly the result of trampling feet! Who hasharnessed such technology?And what curious invitation do these crop circles extend? Since the earliesthuman has walked the Earth, the circle has been the symbol of the meeting place,the temple of gathering and discourse and like lambs seeking guidance in aturbulent Universe, hundreds of thousands of people from all the world's“tribes” have been irresistibly lured to the centers of crop circles.Inside these temples they are overcome by childlike exuberance and wonder asthey meander the latterday labyrinths, each curved path bringing themface-toface with gracious and unexpected patterns that form the boundary betweenseen and unseen, touched and emotive. Much rejoicing, prayer, contemplation, andstudied inquiry are made inside each of these new sacred spaces. When thepilgrims leave, they disembark into a world that, all of a sudden, seemsstrangely different to them, for each and every visitor is imbued with a littleseed, a seed that is at once invigorating, curative, and enlightening.And transformational.Each “seed” opens a gate to endless pastures of knowledge explaining how cropcircles are connected with the subtle sciences of electromagnetism and sound(since discovered to have been used in the construction of stone chambers,pyramids, and Gothic cathedrals); how these frequencies affect the brain wavepatterns of people and the behavior of animals; how they are leaving imprints inthe water we drink, and possibly encoding new systems of information into ourDNA; and how volumes of extraordinary information are encoded into each glyph,including information for new forms of technology.The crop circle designs are brimming with the Universal language of geometry, alanguage recognized by the living cells of the human body, facilitating aclearer dialogue between Heaven and Earth and regenerating the transcendentalnature latent in every human. Could these twenty-first century mandalas beeffecting a subtle change in the consciousness of humanity?Typically, crop circles appear at the beginning of April and continue untilharvest in September. The designs increase in complexity throughout the growingseason, compounding each successive year, and over the decades the generic “cropcircle” has developed into an array of highly complex geometric forms. Theplants flattened by crop circles are neither harmed nor rendered unharvestable.Given the puzzling nature of this phenomenon, not to mention the startlingevidence on the ground, you'd think the subject of crop circles would be at theforefront of media, even of scientific interest. Yet to this day, a myth hasbeen perpetrated that the entire phenomenon is nothing more than a human prank.There is much bad news for this theory, least of which are the hoaxers' claimsto have begun their activities in 1978 in the county of Hampshire, England.Recently published data confirms that crop circles have been manifesting sincethe seventeenth century, and in the latter part of the twentieth century 10,000have been reported in twenty-six countries, 90 percent of them appearing insouthern England alone.The hoax angle is apparently not taken seriously within the British government,a fact confirmed by Nick Pope (the former UFO Desk Officer in Secretariat at theBritish Ministry of Defence) whose duties included the investigation of UFOreports and other anomalous and supernatural phenomena. With access to asubstantial volume of information, Pope concludes that, despite some hoaxing,there exists a hard core of genuine crop circles formed in a way that is not yetscientifically understood. Would this explain, for example, the bewilderment ofthe army officer stationed in the training grounds of Salisbury Plain who,during his nimble negotiation of an active minefield, came across a crop circle?Hardly a site hoaxers would choose.Indeed it would appear that the British army has attempted to keep abreast ofdevelopments. Twenty miles north of Stonehenge another crop formation,1 thistime resembling the spiraling double helix of the DNA strand, was etched uponthe undulating fields of Alton Barnes in Wiltshire. With their backs to thehillside that cradles the field, a small group of sightseers stood on the sideof the road and watched as a military helicopter hovered above the pattern.Without warning, a second helicopter (bearing an eagle insignia) rose up theslope and flew towards them, hovering for a minute beside the group with itsrotors spinning menacingly at head height.As the blades inched their way closer, Kerry Blower abandoned her video recorderand retreated to avoid potential decapitation. The noise was ear-shattering. Asthe camera, left on top of Kerry's car, recorded the harassment, the rest of thegroup, now understandably shaken, hastily retrieved it, bolted for the safety ofthe car and drove away down the road, the helicopter giving chase.Upon Kerry's return to the safety of her home, the phone rang. A senior armyofficial had somehow tracked her down and requested the surrender of the tapedmaterial, despite the whole incident having occurred on public land.Why are the authorities afraid of crop circles? What are they protecting?Perhaps, like me, they are the cats, attracted to the curiosities associatedwith their manifestation: A world away from Wiltshire, in the never-endingflatness of the Saskatchewan prairies, a Canadian farmer checked the progress ofhis wheat and stumbled upon a curiosity: an elliptical imprint in his maturecrop. Believing it at first to be wind damage, he noticed how the stems werestrangely arranged in a concentric manner. From the perimeter, an avenue of darkspines followed the spiral path of flattened plants cursively into the center ofthe design. At its end lay a perfectly flattened and mummified porcupine,apparently sucked or dragged into the melée. Whatever caused this crop circleattracted the unfortunate bystander like a pincushion to a magnet.Curiouser and curiouser.That's precisely the thought that ran through my mind one bright summer's day asI stood inside a complex seven-sided crop circle, its design reminiscent of agrandmother's embroidered handkerchief. In my hand, a photo I took twoafternoons earlier showed two beams of light shining down perpendicularly ontothe exact spot where I stood.Just as I was wondering if my camera inadvertently captured a crop circle in themaking, a series of musical notes repeated around me. “Record this. You'll needit later,” my colleague said, handing me the tiny tape recorder. No matter howhard I looked, the physical source of the music remained absent.Those sounds and those two beams of light represented the crumbling of thebarrier between science and mysticism for me, and have led me on a journey thatresulted in this book, a work containing answers to the questions theyraised—answers that might require us to question our perceptions of what wecurrently term “reality.”Let me put it this way: if you were magically reduced to the size of a grain ofsalt, you would be able to bounce an atom like a soccer ball on your knee andkick it around for an afternoon. Then again, you couldn't. Because atoms—and forthat matter everything in the world that seems physical—are not solid. Sciencehas now established, to its own satisfaction, a fact long recognized by psychicsand our ancestors: The atoms in plants, crystals, and the human body are tinyharmonic resonators in a constant state of vibration. In fact, they are governedby the same principles found in music: “Every particle in the physical universetakes its characteristics from the pitch and pattern and overtones of itsparticular frequencies—it's singing,” says author George Leonard (1978).Atoms, it would seem, are microscopic musical notes.Just as this barrier between science and mysticism is crumbling in ourlaboratories, when the accounts of the crop circle phenomenon as imprintedacross our landscapes begin to transform the foundations of what we were oncetaught, our view of the Universe will be shaken.Perhaps, like me, it will even change your life.As a British citizen of Portuguese parentage, married to a Canadian but workingin Chicago, life for me was already anything but straightforward. Yet I was alevelheaded person, despite the fact that I worked in the high-powered,highearning, high-caffeine world of advertising.My first encounter with a crop circle was in the summer of 1990, courtesy of theevening news in Chicago which described a sensational event thousands of milesaway in England in the East Field of Alton Barnes. I was enraptured by the imageon the TV, oblivious to the commentator's voice and everything else around me.In fact, I cannot remember the time, the day, the location, the TV station, whowas in the room, what I was wearing, or if a herd of bison were passing throughthe house. Yet the effect of that image remains forever branded in my memory.Why did this image of a crop circle have such an effect, overcoming my normalsense of time and space?As an art director by trade, this kind of obliviousness was unusual. Myanalytical brain, permanently switched to sponge-mode, absorbs tremendousamounts of information every day, even trivial stuff such as the style oftypeface on restaurant menus, much to the chagrin of my dining companions. Frommy art student days, I was already conversant with environmental art, whenartists armed with combine harvesters selectively furrowed acres of NorthAmerican prairie to create abstract geometric forms best appreciated from theair.The “art” in this English wheat field could similarly have been their handiwork,yet none of this crossed my mind as I watched the Alton Barnes pictogram ontelevision.Nor did that other extreme of options: UFOs and little green men.No, what I was seeing was a suggestive symbol, and I was transfixed by it as itrambled across to my intuitive right brain, bypassing the left hemisphere ofreason, as if a master hypnotist's rhythmic pass of the hand had induced atrance. The symbol made perfect sense to me. It was familiar, like a message Ihad sent myself a long time ago. Just as under hypnosis a person can beregressed to an earlier age, I felt that crop circles could induce a sense ofremembrance, an awakening of subconscious memories—and it was on this day that Ibegan to remember.I could have easily checked myself into the nearest psychiatric unit, but thepictogram's effect on me seemed so natural. Later I was to hear others confessto the same experience, albeit from different crop circles. I was hooked, and mycuriosity begged to know more about this. Books were sought, images werescoured, knowledge was acquired. Eventually I began spending most summers insouthern England, ready to visit every crop circle. I was consumed, and in turn,the quest consumed a fourteen-year marriage to my best friend, and I lost both.Beautiful house, beautiful life, and bountiful finances gone, I returned tocomplete my “studies” in England.Now, I hear you say: “This man is a fool; he threw away his perfect life for afew acres of trampled wheat.” Yet the incidents I just described are a flavor ofsome of the things I know. From chapter 1 [10_chapter01.html#c1], I will leadyou through the phenomenon, including the fraud and misinformation, to thescience at the heart of the crop circle mystery. This science is so subtle, sowise, and so awe-inspiring that it has the power to humble you and wake you upto a greater reality.In putting this work together I have drawn from my personal experiences andthose of scores of individuals who have similarly dedicated their time toinvestigate the nature of this enigma, often at crushing expense—personal,financial, and marital. However, the words presented in this book are not thetruth. If they were the “truth,” they would only be my truth, which is of nohelp to you because personal truths can be used to create idols, orthodoxbeliefs, institutions, power, and, ultimately, control. Instead, what I presenthere are facts.Facts can be unwelcome because they have the power to disturb. But if you areopen to facts, you are encouraged to seek and to discover the Universal wisdomwhich, ultimately and ironically, already reigns within you.I entered this pursuit with an open, objective, and atheistic mind in 1990, onlyto emerge humbled eleven years later with a newfound belief in and respect forlife and its Creator. Perhaps most importantly, in all this time I haveconsciously tried to keep both my feet on the ground. Believe me, amidst theegos and the misinformation, a grounded attitude is indispensable, and a senseof humor doesn't hurt, either.As we delve into the heart of the crop circle mystery it will become clear thatthe circles not only have much knowledge to offer, but they are appearing atthis critical moment in our history to remind us of an evolutionary connectionthat is in our best interests to rekindle—the sooner, the better.In this book, we shall examine how the appearance of crop circles coincides withancient predictions, from Egyptian texts to the Bible's book of Revelation. Wewill see that seeded within the crop circles is a manual offering all citizensof this precious jewel of a planet a unique opportunity to rediscover theirpotential during these critical days of change. The crop circles offer usmirrors in which to view our present direction and to reflect on this, and thekeys to our evolution—a reminder of where we come from and a signpost to wherewe are headed.In part 1, we examine the history of the crop circle phenomenon, building apicture of its modus operandi, its interaction with people, its effects on ourcurrent worldview, and its probable implications.In part 2, we delve into the evidence in detail, moving from the left brain ofscience to the right brain of metaphysics. Among the topics covered: the role ofelectromagnetism, its effects on plants, people, and our concept of matter;“balls of light,” UFO phenomena, their correspondence to the nature of theUniverse and the relationship of all this to crop circles; the language ofsymbols and this language's ability to impart information consciously andsubconsciously; the thread connecting sacred geometry, temples, consciousness,and crop circles; the part played by sound in the creation of the Universe andin the circle-making process; the strategic placement of sacred sites, theirenergetic properties and their effect on living things; Earth energy and theinfluencing of the Earth's “grid” by crop circles; the memory of water, and therelationship of crop circles and healing; and evidence supporting psychicability, and the relationships among the levels of reality in the Universe.As you read the chapters you may become aware of my train of thoughttransforming from linear logic to thinking “in the round.” What may appear atfirst to be a collection of facts will eventually coalesce into a relevant wholeand an overall picture will gradually emerge. Some of these facts are triggers,allowing you to reexamine preconceived ideas. The footnotes and extensivebibliography further support this goal. I encourage you to explore the points Ibring up and take what I have written to a new level of personal understanding.1Crop circles are described throughout this book in a manner of styles. For thesake of clarity I refer to “crop circles” as a general term, or when describingevents involving simple circles or sets thereof; I refer to “crop formations” or“patterns” when describing shapes incorporating several elements, and to “cropglyphs” where complex designs are involved."},{"pageContent":"PART ONETHE HISTORY OF CROP CIRCLES"},{"pageContent":"1. WEATHER OR NOTTo know all, it is necessary to know very little; but to know that very little,one must first know pretty much.—Georges I. GurdjieffThis is a gentle, rolling land, mostly soft with chalk and clay, and the eye iseasily seduced by subtly curved lowland hills rich in pastures and crop-bearingfields that sweep down from tree-peppered skylines. This terrain has bornewitness to the activities of Man since time immemorial. But there is mysteryhere, for amid the sparsely wooded fields, separated by hawthorn hedgerows,hundreds of ancient earthen mounds rise like goosepimples blanketed in greenfelt. These are the long barrows and tumuli, survivors of ten thousand years ofBritish rain and as many ideologies as Man has cared to invent.Image [images/p3-01.jpg]Figure 1.1 Mysterious Britain. Top: A cairn or dolmen. Bottom: A series oftumuli, ring barrows, and saucer barrows atop the Neolithic hill fort complex ofWindmill Hill.Sharing this ancient landscape are the enchanting stone circles, their needlesof stone stoic, determined and proud in the face of change, silent remnants of agigantic, interconnected network of sites that once covered the Earth duringNeolithic times. The same applies to the “hill forts” whose flattened terracesencircled by earthen embankments crown the summits of sculpted chalk hills andartificially shaped promontories. Yet these “forts,” with their curious namessuch as Barbury Castle and Uffington Castle, have no walled fortifications, nordo they appear to serve any military purpose.Image [images/p4-01.jpg]Figure 1.2 Ninety percent of the world's reported crop circles congregate withinthe old kingdom of Wessex, an area of southern Britain containing the countiesof Hampshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, and West Sussex. Significant clusters alsoexist in Devon, East Sussex, and Cambridgeshire.Indeed, there is mystery here, for this is Wessex, an ancient southern Englishkingdom whose central region comprises the modern-day counties of Hampshire andWiltshire, and once included parts of Dorset to the south, Somerset to the west,and Sussex to the east.With an air of nonchalance, Roger Sear walked into the circle of tall swirledgrass below the watchful gaze of the ancient Cisbury Rings hill fort. It was thesummer of 1927, and young Roger was no stranger to the circles which heaffectionately called “witch's rings.” This one was similar to those he'dregularly stumbled upon in previous years throughout Sussex. But of specialinterest to him were the unusual effects generated by these curious markings:the magnetization of a knife that he had stuck into the soil at the center; atickling sensation in his feet; the refusal of a dog to enter the circle; andthe magnetization of a prized pocket watch which resulted in its demise.On a previous occasion, Roger had seen the needle of his compass go berserk whenhe took it into a circle. From then on, it would only point to the circleinstead of obeying magnetic north. He had also noticed that a smell akin to“electrical burning” filled the air and that the grass seemed “charged” to thepoint that the bicycles of Roger and his companion, Sid, were made sufficientlyfull of static electricity to give them electric shocks. When they returned tothe scene later, a second circle had appeared, and despite their excitingadventure, both boys returned home with painful headaches (T. Wilson 1998).Eight years later, at Helions Bumpstead in Essex, a ten-year-old boy witnessedsomething even more miraculous: he saw a crop circle manifesting. Although ithappened in a matter of seconds, the boy's adult companion brushed off the eventas nothing more than the “Devil's twist,” a kind of whirlwind blamed forinstigating similar disturbances in this area since at least 1830. But what kindof winds were these that rushed about the countryside creating perfectly formedcircles and rings with swirled floors, sharply defined edges, and an unaffectedcentral tuft of plants? The swirled plants also appeared to have re-hardenedinto their new horizontal position, because attempts by both the boy and thefarmer to raise them with a pitchfork resulted in the stems springing back down.Throughout early crop circle history, it is not unusual to hear local farmersand nature enthusiasts reminiscing about walking out around dawn to inspect thefields only to come across these circles and rings, some as large as sixty feetin diameter, of flattened yet undamaged plants. They tell of farm animalsbehaving erratically, of sheep and cattle acting in a distressed manner prior toa circle's arrival, and superstitious farmhands refusing to touch the oddcircles. Some recall sightings of UFOs or bright, colored lights in thevicinity, many of which are substantiated by local police records.The greatest concentration of these events was in Wessex, as well as theCanadian prairie (T. Wilson 1998). These early sightings were supported byeighty eyewitness accounts from people as far flung as British Columbia andAustralia having seen crop circles actually form. It is significant that most ofthese accounts remain unpublished and yet they corroborate one another. Theydescribe how the morning chorus of birds abruptly stops, replaced by a trillingsound, followed by the agitation of the wheat heads by a tremendous vibration,and the collapse of a section of the field in seconds.2Perhaps the young witness at Helions Bumpstead was not as prone to fantasy as hewas led to believe. However, in the 1920s and 1930s, with the wind and even theDevil as prime suspects, nobody bothered to seriously investigate these circularcuriosities in the crops, so no answers would be forthcoming for many decades.In 1965, there was a sudden eruption of simple circles around the Wiltshire townof Warminster, at the snaking Hakpen Hill twenty miles to the northeast, and atSt. Catherine's Hill outside Winchester in Hampshire. All three locations arerich in strangely shaped chalk hills crowned with long barrows or tumuli; theyare equally steeped in folklore describing apparitions, visitations from naturespirits, and sightings of impossible aerial maneuvers performed by equallyimprobable luminous craft. Yet it would take another fifteen years before asmall report tucked away in the Wiltshire Times (August 15, 1980) finallygrabbed the attention of science.Image [images/p5-01.jpg]Figure 1.3 Terminology of crop circles features.Image [images/p6-01.jpg]Figure 1.4 Selected crop circles, 1970-1990.The photo of three precise circles of flattened oats beneath the hill fort ofBratton, with the plants spiraled and neatly laid along the ground, attractedthe attention of meteorologist Dr. Terence Meaden, who went on to investigate.As founder-member of the Tornado and Storm Research Organization, his interestin weather phenomena led him to postulate that stationary whirlwinds wereresponsible for the appearance of these circles. Despite the fact that volatilewinds generally tend to rip things out of the ground and propel them skywards inchaotic fashion, this was generally considered to be a satisfactory explanation.The farmer involved, a Mr. Cooper, remained unconvinced. He said, “I have neverseen anything like it before. It certainly can't be wind or rain damage becauseI have seen plenty of that, and it is just not that regular.”Mr. Cooper's housekeeper recalled hearing an unusual humming noise coming fromthe field the night before a second set of circles appeared, a noise that lastedtwenty minutes. Mr. Cooper's dogs barked uncharacteristically for most of thatnight. An investigator named Ian Mrzyglod interviewed Cooper and his neighboringfarmer, Mr. Scull, about evidence of human entry into their circles, but thefarmers said no suspicious trails were evident, in or out, just circles amid avirgin crop.The following summer, an electromechanical engineer named Pat Delgado wasenjoying the privileges of a quiet retirement in Hampshire when a friendwondered what he would make of the strange markings found in a field a few milesaway at Cheesefoot Head. His curiosity aroused, Delgado drove to thishorseshoe-shaped amphitheater whereupon he encountered a sight that was tochange his life.Below him lay three imprints: one 51-foot and two 25.5-foot diameter circles,with their centers in perfect linear alignment. With the absence of “tram lines”(the characteristic tractor ruts that nowadays run in parallel lines across mostfields), two hundred or so feet of pristine wheat surrounded the formation, itsedges perfectly upright, as if traced out with surgical instruments. With theabsence of paths running in or out, their positioning surely implied that inorder to make these circles, either their creator had levitated from the groundor that these patterns had been imprinted from above.The impact on Delgado was profound. He took to studying new reports inpainstaking detail and began alerting the media to the unusual events dottingthe English countryside.Image [images/p7-01.jpg]Figure 1.5Every report brought new discoveries and observations, one of the first beingthe persistent referencing to nearby Neolithic sites. For example, in 1981 atLitchfield, Hampshire, an invisible magnetic line connecting the centers of twocrop circles was identical to the one running through the two prehistoric moundsa few yards to the north; their respective diameters were also identical. By1983, many crop circles were appearing below hill forts. Quintuplets—largecircles surrounded by four small satellite circles, one at each point on thecompass like a Celtic cross—appeared below the unusual horseshoe features ofCley Hill, Uffington, and Bratton, and a fourth appeared in Cheesefoot Head.When yet another quintuplet surfaced later, below Bratton hill fort, the clumsyappearance of the formation's details aroused the suspicion of Mrzyglod, as wellas Bob Rickard, editor of Fortean Times, a magazine about unexplained phenomena.Indeed, it seemed as if a nonparanormal explanation was at hand on thisoccasion. After the Daily Express had scooped the story about the real circles,a jealous Daily Mirror paid a local family, the Shepherds, to hoax this newpattern close to the original circles. Yet the Shepherds' handiwork showed clearsigns of entry, not to mention clear indications of damage to the plants, thanksto their use of heavy chains to flatten the crop.The hoax aside, Terence Meaden's stationary whirlwind theory had to be expandedto accommodate these new developments. He had proposed that the 1980three-in-a-line triplets were the result of three whirlwinds (even though thecircles' diameters had a mathematical ratio of 2:1, the same relationship thatdefines the octave in music), and now the quintuplets were a series ofwhirlwinds in a multi-vortex state, in which, he proposed, the in-flowingvortical motion of the major whirlwind stabilized minor whirlwinds in asymmetrical alignment.In 1984, the previous year's quintuplets aroused the curiosity of a famousresident in Alfriston when they descended upon the Sussex home of the LabourParty's Foreign Secretary Dennis Healey. Healey admitted he wasn't a believer inUFOs, yet the night the circles appeared below nearby Cradle Hill, his wife hadseen a strange bright light in the sky; when he inspected the formation, Healeycould find no rational explanation for it. Interestingly, a second Cradle Hillexists opposite Cley Hill in Warminster, home of Britain's most fertile locationfor UFO sightings.Meanwhile, Pat Delgado was now joined in his research by another perplexedindividual, Colin Andrews, then chief electrical engineer for the Test ValleyBorough Council in Hampshire. Together they began establishing patterns ofbehavior, including the fact that crop circles were appearing next to, or on topof, areas containing large amounts of water, such as springs, ponds, reservoirs,underground water tanks, even the heart of the watershed itself. In one case,farmer Charles Hall of Corhampton Lane Farm observed how the edge of a cropcircle on his property was located within 16 feet of an old pond; he alsomentioned that a second pond was still active in the north part of his estate.Weeks later, a second circle appeared within 300 feet of it (Andrews and Delgado1991).Contrary to the natural reaction of downed plants responding to sunlight, anuntouched crop circle at Gander Down demonstrated how the flattened stems madeno attempt to regain their vertical posture, continuing instead to growhorizontally and to ripen. This would be almost impossible had the plants beendamaged by force. To add to the mystery, the night before the formation wasfound, two senior citizens saw a UFO—“A huge yellow-white circular objectstanding on end, like a funfair wheel”—barely two hundred yards away. Terrified,they reported the sighting to the police who filed a report on this as an“Unidentified Flying Object.” Andrews heard the report on his radio and rushedto the location, where he found police officers combing the area withsearchlights. Little did they know that this UFO attribution would fit a futuresighting elsewhere in crop circle country some years later.As a logical progression began to develop in the designs from one season to thenext, one had to wonder just how intelligent this “wind” had become. AtGoodworth Clatford, another quintuplet had three of its satellites connectedthrough their centers by the thinnest of orbital rings, but, in a twist on thedesign theme, the plants along the ring weren't laid down as usual: they werebent, bowed over so that their heads touched the ground.When the 1985 season had finished, Delgado organized a meeting with variousinterested parties to collate evidence and review theories. One party inattendance was Lt. Col. Edgecombe, an officer from the nearby Army Air Base atBoscombe Down, whose pilots were showing increasing interest in the cropformations, monitoring their appearance, and taking photos. Col. Edgecombeargued against the hoax theory, for the most part because hoaxers would haveleft tracks in the crop, and from his investigation, no such tracks wereevident. Intrigued, Col. Edgecombe filed a report with the UFO InvestigationDesk at the Ministry of Defence in London.The researchers began to wonder if someone—or something—was playing a game.Indeed, paranormal events seemed to follow them, as if attempting to demonstratea supernatural force was masterminding the work. Colin Andrews will never forgethow he took home a sample of odd-looking soil from a new crop formation. Inhindsight, the design appeared to have been premeditated for him to perform thetask in the first place, for this circle and ring contained a novel feature: astraight pathway placed at exactly 120 degrees to magnetic north, running awayfrom the perimeter of the ring. Fifteen feet along, the avenue tapered into anarrowhead shape, at the base of which appeared a small bowl-shaped hole withperfectly smooth sides. Andrews removed a sample from this spot and brought itto his office, which was protected by an extensive alarm system. For the nexttwo weeks, the Andrews' home turned into a supernatural amusement park.Minutes after the mysterious soil had been tucked away behind locked doors forthe night, the infrared sensor in the empty office detected movement andactivated one of the alarms. Andrews, a designer of alarm systems andappreciator of their shortcomings, paid little attention to thecoincidence—until the following morning.At 4:15 A.M., the perimeter alarm for the house rang. The electric time clockhad failed and would not set, but the next day it came back to life. A fewnights later it stopped working again, at 4:15 A.M., this time joined by theseparately rigged office alarm, whose microwave detector had been activated atthe same time. To add to the chaos, the battery-powered wall clock had alsodecided to call it a day at 4:15 A.M. This state of affairs carried on forfourteen mornings, a fact corroborated by the Andrews' sleep-deprived neighborsand the unamused local police.By now, a talented pilot named Busty Taylor had joined Delgado and Andrews.These three, along with Don Tuersley, Paul Fuller, Terence Meaden, and IanMrzylglod, created a team which took on crop circle research with greatdedication and thoroughness, and to all of whom we are indebted for the vastvolume of early data on this subject. Busty was on a routine aerialreconnaissance above Hampshire when he remarked to his passenger: “All we wantnow is to find all the formations we have seen so far wrapped into one.” Thenext morning, the pair were flying over the exact spot where Busty had spokenthese words when the very pattern he had requested appeared in the wheat below;even better, it had a large water reservoir under it (Andrews and Delgado 1991).As events and strange coincidences gathered momentum, a growing list of possiblecauses began to be put forward by various individuals and institutions as towhat was responsible for disturbing the orderly English landscape with markingsmore typical of Star Trek than John Constable. Predictably, the capricious mediaadopted the theory of little green men. With crop circle designs now developinginto ever more complex configurations, Terence Meaden persisted with hisstationary whirlwinds theory, despite the fact that additions to existingdesigns began to manifest in geometric alignment to (or were superimposed over)existing formations. But how could wind vortices be conscious enough to returnto the same location with pinpoint accuracy?As if to test Meaden's resolve, the Circlemakers (the collective term for thearchitects of the genuine phenomenon) created a fifty-four-foot diameter circleat Headbourne Worthy. They swirled the plants in standard clockwise motion, butthis time laid them toward the center, with a thin band around the perimeterswirled anticlockwise and pointing away from the center. Further, when the stemswere lifted, a second layer existed underneath, flattened counter to the topone. Meaden tenaciously stuck to the weather explanation, arguing that thewhirlwind had abruptly switched its rotation (T. Wilson 1998). The Circlemakerslater replied to this explanation by creating a formation with two annular ringsaround a circle, each element in contra-rotation to the next.Weather or not, the bewildered farmers whose lives were becoming affected withincreasing frequency by the circle phenomenon decided that the problem should betaken up with Parliament. Despite Delgado and Andrews' findings that aphenomenon of supernatural, possibly extraterrestrial, origin was manifesting,the British government decided, at least outwardly, to stand behind theconvenient weather theory. In other words, there was no cause for alarm;everything in the English countryside was normal, according to officialdom.Anything but normal was the plethora of alternative theories: drunks withstring, wild young farmers, disillusioned art students, out-of-work journalists,disinformation people from the military, over-application of fertilizer,interference from mobile phones, flocks of geometrically gifted crows, evensex-mad hedgehogs.At some point in 1987, hot air balloons were added to the list of probable waysone could drop into the middle of a field without leaving any sign of entry. Tomaneuver a balloon with its basket at head height and hold it motionless for afew hours whilst the guilty did their work without being spotted would be asupernatural feat in itself. But since the plant media employed so far—primarilywheat and barley—were flexible and relatively easy to imprint by a descendingobject, some people felt seriously compelled to put this idea into the publicdomain, so the Circlemakers decided to switch to canola as the next worthy cropcanvas.Image [images/p10-01.jpg]Figure 1.6 Simple circle in canola.Given the nature of canola plants it was no surprise that farmer David Steineragreed to carry out a scientific study on a crop circle discovered in his brightyellow field. Canola stems are very brittle, snapping like celery if bent, andthe plants in David's formation were clearly bent at the base, almost steamedinto place. As in all crop circles before it, the plants were bent at nearly aright angle, an inch above the soil and just below the first node—the plant's“knuckles.” Any damage to canola causes its yellow flowers to die, yet all thedelicate flowers were intact.As if this weren't enough of a puzzle, Andrews and his father were measuring thecircle when they saw a bright flash around them, followed by a distinctive noiselike crackling. The sound was so loud it was heard seventy feet away by Andrews'mother sitting inside her car at the edge of the field with the windows rolledup (Andrews and Delgado 1991).Strange noises like this became an increasingly common occurrence, particularlywhen Andrews visited a new site at Kimpton—an unusual oval ring, approximatelythirty feet across. “I've never seen anything like this before,” exclaimed thefarmer, Mr. Flambert, astounded at the sight of it. Upon their return to thecar, two young boys, unaware that Andrews was a researcher, told him they'd seena glowing, orange object hovering over the area he was examining. Later,unprompted, an elderly couple asked Andrews if he'd come to investigate the“warbling, humming-like” noises they'd heard emanating from the field a few daysearlier (Andrews and Delgado 1991).During further measuring and note-taking, Andrews was spooked by a sudden blackshadow which “blotted out the sun for an instant.” Later that afternoon, hisparents' dog scampered around the field until it froze at a spot adjacent to thering. Within minutes the dog was vomiting, and only when taken out of theimmediate area did the luckless canine recover his vigor. Despite the litany ofunnerving events, Andrews felt compelled to return in the evening, whereupon helooked up at the sky in quiet desperation and spoke out loud, “God, if you wouldonly give me a clue as to how these are created.” In less than ten seconds hehad a reply.According to Andrews' account, an “electrical cracking noise started to comefrom a spot about nine feet away. It grew louder, up to a pitch where I expecteda bang to follow. Frightened, I looked towards the village to check my quickestroute out of the field. I fought to control my panic and remained still. Assuddenly as it had started, it stopped. It had lasted about six seconds,although it seemed longer. I saw nothing and nothing moved” (Andrews and Delgado1991).It was now the summer of 1987, and reports of crop circles were increasing at afurious rate. In one twenty-four-hour period, fifteen circles appeared aroundWarminster alone, and with them a rash of new discoveries. Magnetic disturbancesplayed havoc with compasses in some of the formations, and in terms of design,small circles were now superimposed over or overlapped by new formations, whileothers displayed an ever-increasing complexity of swirl detail.In one memorable incident, the night after local Wiltshire police were floodedwith reports of UFO sightings, a large quintuplet formation appeared at UptonScudamore bearing a remarkable anticlockwise S-shaped swirl in three of thesatellites but reversed in the fourth. Meanwhile, two miles north at Westbury, acircle containing half a revolution swirl was so impressive in its precisionthat researchers felt walking upon it to be sacrilegious.The Wingfield family, an interested group from Somerset, also experiencedunusual flashes similar to the one described by Andrews. Standing alone on ahill while her family investigated a circle below, Mrs. Wingfield was confrontedby a blue flashing light which seemed to be shining on the ground in front ofher, pulsating every second or so as if it was reflecting off a spinning, shinysurface somewhere above. Alarmed, she raced down the hill to join her husbandwho, like Delgado and Andrews, was about to be bitten by the crop circle bug.The testimonials were piling up. Farmer Geoff Cooper got up one morning to begreeted with his own set of circles: “One night our dog went silly barking, realnasty-like. Usually he would stop on a firm command, but not that night. He wenton for ages—he was really upset. I wish now I had looked out, because when I didin the morning I could see five circles had appeared in the corn [wheat] duringthe night. I don't know what caused them. I don't think they are made by people.We have tried to make them with ropes, poles, and so on, but they just cannot bereplicated” (Andrews and Delgado 1991).One discovery led to another, giving the impression that behind the phenomenonlay an orderly, even premeditated plan. As the end of August 1987 approached,the list of anomalous features multiplied by the week, as did the pace of newreports, by now in the hundreds. But one more episode was brewing that wouldfinish off the year in dramatic fashion.Just a short distance along the road from Stonehenge, upon the intermittentlywooded Wiltshire plain, the small town of Winterbourne Stoke played host to anenormous seventy-five-foot ringed circle with three outlying satellite circles.It had swirl patterns so tight and compressed that from the air it looked as ifit was spinning. Despite materializing on a high embankment beside the busy A303London-to-Exeter road, nothing more out of the ordinary was reported—until twomonths later.Image [images/p12-01.jpg]Figure 1.7 The once-flattened stalks have selectively risen in a radial patternof forty-eight lines and seven concentric rings inside each circle; the damagein the center of two of the circles was caused later by visitors. Theformation's triangular alignment would later yield a geometric theorem.At 5:06 P.M. on October 22, the Ministry of Defence suddenly found £13.5 millionof its hardware missing. Shortly after a pilot radioed in with “nothing unusual”to report, the military air base at Boscombe Down lost radio contact with one ofits Harrier jump jets. This “audio disappearance” happened over the precise spotwhere the crop circle formation had lain a few weeks earlier. Meanwhile, ninetymiles southwest from the coast of Ireland, the crew of an American transportplane got the surprise of their lives when they sighted the Harrier casuallyflying out over the Atlantic, pilotless and minus a roof canopy. The followingday, a rescue party discovered the body of the pilot alongside his reserveparachute and life raft a couple of hundred yards from the site of themysterious circles.There were seemingly no answers to two questions: Why had the pilot ejected outof a perfectly operational plane? Why had the plane deviated by several degreesfrom its designated course just at the point where audio contact was lost? Theejector seat was never recovered (ibid.).With such episodes gnawing away at their cynicism, the media's interest in cropcircles began to warm up, and with it the public's curiosity. This increase ininquisitiveness was further fueled throughout the summer of 1988, as crop circledesigns continued to evolve, such as the innovation of appearing in pairs on thesame field on separate occasions. Of particular interest was a grouping of threethirty-two-foot circles, all perfectly aligned within an invisible equilateraltriangle. Exactly a week later, the tender and previously flattened barleyplants inside the circles began to regain their upright posture, and in a mostexquisite fashion.According to the field report, the plants had risen selectively along theirnodes in groups of three within an oblong area roughly covering two feet by onefoot. The first group of plants raised itself at the node nearest the ground,the second at the mid-node, and the third at the node nearest the seed head. Theprocess was then repeated radially, creating a pattern now consisting of sevenconcentric rings and forty-eight spokes, as if the plants had been programmed togrow back in selected fashion. Every circle was identical. According toagricultural expert, Dr. Mark Glover, these features are definitely not theresult of fertilizers, agrochemical treatment, disease, pest damage, soil type,or even plant behavior (Andrews and Delgado 1991).With the weather theory in a quandary, Terence Meaden's model of modifiedvortices now required specific topographical features that enabled crop circlesto appear. That is, they could only appear on the leeward sides of hills. Withindays, two reports surfaced from the town of Langenburg, in the flat prairie ofSaskatchewan, where in 1974 farmer Edwin Fuhr had found five shiny silver discshovering over his canola, making the plants sway. Fifteen minutes later, he sawthe discs bolt into the sky, leaving behind five circles; a similar incidentlater occurred in the prairies of Manitoba. Back in England, the new cropformations similarly contradicted Meaden's theory by moving to the open, rollinglandscape around Europe's largest man-made “pyramid,” Silbury Hill inWiltshire.3 By July 1988, fifty-one formations lay within a seven-mile arc ofthis enigmatic prehistoric monument, and from its 430-foot summit, groupings ofcircles like Celtic crosses gathered together like apostles, as if to collect amessage to send out to the world (see figure 1.9 [10_chapter01.html#fig1.9]).One such message arrived in the form of a book, Circular Evidence. Andrews andDelgado had by now acquired so much data they decided it was time the public begiven an alternative to the drunks-with-strings explanations or theweather-based theory still adhered to by officialdom, even though Dr. Meadenfine-tuned his theory by placing the responsibility with superheated columns ofair called plasma vortices.4 His revised theory also suggested that, within sucha vortex, columns of contra-rotating air could explain the behavior of plantsinside a new crop circle encompassed by a single ring, in which the plants inthe circle were laid clockwise but anticlockwise within the outer ring (Meaden1985).Image [images/p13-01.jpg]Figure 1.8Image [images/p14-01.jpg]Figure 1.9 The quintuplets arrive at the base of Silbury Hill. 1989.The Circlemakers obliged him by creating new, single-ringed circles in which theplants were laid in only one direction (see figure 1.8[10_chapter01.html#fig1.8]).With the evidence now available in the bookstands, public interest in cropcircles escalated, followed by greater scientific and media scrutiny. CircularEvidence and its authors were favorably profiled in such newspapers as The WallStreet Journal and The Times; one Daily Mail reviewer described how the book“took at least this reader's skeptical breath away.” But the big question oneveryone's mind was this: Who is behind these things?To find out, fifty scientists, engineers, and various other interested partiesjoined forces in the summer of 1989 for Operation White Crow. This surveillanceproject amassed truckloads of high-tech equipment, and planned a two-weekstakeout of the prolific crop circle location of Cheesefoot Head near Winchesterin Hampshire, a site known locally as the Devil's Punchbowl.The infrared and imageintensifier cameras were primed and poised around the rimof this huge natural amphitheater. A warm breeze rolled off the enclosing fieldsof gold, flirting around the expectant gathering of researchers.At three in the morning on the second night of the project, a bright orange ballappeared suddenly over the Punchbowl, and it remained there fairly still forabout five minutes until the lights of a passing truck seemingly shooed it away.After that promising start, there was little to write home about, and by thelast day it was obvious that nothing else was going to be recorded on film. Asthe scientists packed up their equipment, a small group among them was not readyto give up. With clairvoyant Rita Gould, they decided to walk to a neighboringfield where an older pair of circles were nested and sit inside one of them insilence, waiting to see what happened next.It took only ten minutes before the familiar trilling sound surrounded them.Heard by all present, it moved within a few feet of the group in a random,nonlinear path. The noise orbited the circle once, then again. Rita communicatedwith it: “If you understand our intent, please stop.” The noise dutifullycomplied for a few seconds, then resumed. The surveyors had now become thesurveyed. Not feeling threatened, but spooked nevertheless, they decided toleave the site.However, curiosity nagged at them. George Wingfield grabbed a tape recorder, andfive minutes later he and Andrews were back in the circle, and so was the noisewhich appeared to enjoy the flirt. “Please, will you make us a circle?”requested Wingfield, tape recorder at the ready. But things are never thatstraightforward in crop circle research. As dawn broke, a police car drove by toinform the weary team that a new formation had just appeared in the field to theeast of their site. Despite the intense scrutiny, it was obvious the capriciouscircle-making Puck wished to communicate, but had no desire to be caught at it.It seemed as if 1989 was going to be the “Year of the Noise.” After the recordedhum made its debut on TV, the BBC dispatched a team to Beckhampton, home to anew 120-foot circle and ring, to interview Andrews and Delgado. In hindsight,the world-renowned broadcasting company would have done well to take out extrainsurance on its equipment. The moment the £35,000 high-tech video camera wasbrought near the circle and its satellite-laden rings, noise bars denotinginterference appeared on its screen, followed by an agonizing array of redwarning lights. Suddenly, the sound engineer appeared irritated by a loud,penetrating hum, and the camera died. The BBC, though astonished, broadcastedthe entire sequence of events to an even more incredulous public.Image [images/p15-01.jpg]Figure 1.10 Clear discrepancies between the frequency of the crop circle “noise”and the suspected grasshopper warbler, as analyzed by computer expert PaulVigay.After the noise had baffled BBC sound engineers and camera repair technicians,it was given a graphic analysis at the University of Sussex. There, it wasconcluded that the sound contained a harmonic frequency of 5.0–5.2 kHz(kilohertz), identical to the one previously recorded at Operation White Crow atCheesefoot Head. The idea was put forward that what these “crank investigators”had captured on tape was a bird, the small grasshopper warbler, and yet theskeptics seemed unfazed by the fact that this rare bird frequents commons andmarshes rather than rolling fields of grain.The sounds received a comparative analysis, and not only was the bird's 7 kHzsound proved to oscillate at a frequency 2 kHz above the alien noise, but bothsound imprints were audibly dissimilar (as shown by computer expert Paul Vigay'sanalysis). Cross-checking with all species of available bird and insect sounds,a separate analysis at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory by Dr. Robert Weiss (heanalyzed the Nixon Watergate tapes) reached a similar conclusion: It was not ananomaly of magnetic tape or nature, but a noise of artificial origin (Andrewsand Delgado 1990).Image [images/p16-01.jpg]Figure 1.11 With its quartered and interwoven floor pattern, this “swastika”blew down the weather theory. Winterbourne Stoke, 1989.The crop circle debate reached the British Parliament on July 11, 1989, whenTeddy Taylor, M.P., asked the Secretary of State for Defence, Mr. Neubert, “Whatprogress has been made in the inquiries initiated by Army helicopters based inthe southwest in investigating the origin of flattened circular areas of wheat?”To which Mr. Neubert elusively replied, “The Ministry of Defence is notconducting any inquiries into the origins of flattened circular areas of crops.However, we are satisfied that they are not caused by service helicopteractivity.”It is strange that on pages 73 and 82 of Circular Evidence, an army helicopteris clearly seen reconnoitering crop circles at Westbury—one of many suchincidences. Stranger still, in an article two days previous to the Parliamentarydebate, the Sunday Express had stated that then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherwas “passing a funding report to the Ministry of Defence.”The focus next returned to the fields around Winterbourne Stoke and a newsixtyfoot circle sporting the most complex of floor patterns. It was dubbed the“swastika” because its plants were laid into four quadrants aligned to the fourmagnetic cardinal points. Overlaid in the center was a ninefoot diameter swirlwhose plants abruptly changed direction three times before reaching thequadrants. Around the perimeter, a three-foot wide clockwise band lay partlybeneath the quadrants, giving the impression that the plants had been workedbackwards and towards the center. Given this woven effect, the circular patch ofplants was seemingly synchronized to collapse simultaneously. This effect wasunprecedented.Despite the mountain of evidence that now did not leave much room for weather orhuman hands as a cause, Dr. Meaden held his ground: “The effect of a descendingenergetic vortex from the atmosphere, a vortex of air which is ionized to thepoint of being a species of lowdensity cool plasma producing an electromagneticfield,” was responsible for the simpler, nonhoaxed markings, he said. This massof electrically charged air would apparently form under certain meteorologicalconditions, preferably at the base of hills. “Such vortices,” he added, “havebeen seen by numerous witnesses, and in the case of the related summerwhirlwind, the electromagnetic fields have been measured by atmosphericscientists working in the USA and North Africa” (Meaden 1989).But this still could not account for crop circles appearing in all manner oftopographical and weather conditions, or for the two circles that appeared inrice paddies on Kyushu Island in Japan. Besides, atmospheric conditions createhavoc, not neat circles and rings.A series of further death blows to the weather theories came early in 1990 witha leap in the history of crop circle language. A circle at Bishops Canning Down,300 feet in diameter and orbited by three rings, each six inches wide, developeda fourth ring several days later, essentially making the pattern 1,000 feet wide(see figure 1.12 [10_chapter01.html#fig1.12]). It was improbable that adescending atmospheric plasma vortex could have returned to add a perfectlysited geometric feature to a week-old design.Image [images/p17-01.jpg]Figure 1.12 Seven days after appearing, this gigantic circle “grew” a fourth,outer ring. Its previously flattened crop subsequently rose into radials andconcentric rings. Bishops Canning Down, 1990.An even greater repudiation of conventional theories lay at the opposite end ofWessex. At Chilcomb Farm, a circle appeared containing a ruler-straight centralpathway of narrower width, leading to a second, detached circle. The design wasflanked by four rectangular boxes separated by stands of virgin crop. Freelancewriter Ruth Rees subsequently posed the allimportant question to the nation'sMeteorological Office: “Could any type of atmospheric vortex create crop circleswith straight lines and rectangles?”The reply from a board member of the Royal Meteorological Society stated: “Suchpatterns cannot be the result of atmospheric vortices, due to the sharp anglesthat appear to be present in the shapes, and also because of the elaborate,organized nature of the patterns. Real vortices possess rather indistinct edges.. . . Flattening of the crop in a straight line could result from a travelingvortex, but then we would expect the line width to be similar to that of thecircle diameter” (Delgado 1992).Image [images/p18-01.jpg]Figure 1.13 Chilcomb, 1990.The late Lord Zuckerman, who had been chief scientific advisor to the Britishgovernment from 1964 to 1971 and science advisor to the British Royal Family,was also skeptical of Meaden's explanation:It is inconceivable that a circular downwardly spiraling vortex could createpictograms graced with neatly arranged rectangles of flattened corn. Nor, sinceDr. Meaden's hypothesis demands that his presumed downwardly directed vorticesgenerate their effects only in specific topographical and meteorologicalconditions, can they accept that an elaborate pictogram can be repeatedpractically to the same dimensions miles from where it was first seen, and in alandscape totally different from the first (Zuckerman 1991).Surprisingly, Lord Zuckerman's article for the New York Review carried none ofthe sarcastic, dismissive overtones generally associated with remarks byscientists. In fact, the article left one with the distinct impression thatZuckerman saw the mystery as nonhuman and created by a great intelligence.The weather theory died and the pictogram was born.Garnished with haloes or semi-circular paths, crop circle pictograms (symbolsrepresenting an idea, as in early writing and hieroglyphs) quickly becameidentifiable with petroglyphs, the rock carvings of the ancient world. Onepictogram at Longwood, near Cheesefoot Head, contained a wilted pathway and fourdrooping streams, giving the impression of a crying planet, silently protestinghumanity's compromising of the delicate balance of nature.Image [images/p18-02.jpg]Figure 1.14 Longwood, 1990.One thing seemed clear: After initial contact through simple designs involvingdots and rings, the Circlemakers were now transmitting a message in the form ofrecognizable symbols.The public's interest became insatiable. People from all walks of life beganstreaming into crop circles, and with this tide of visitors came more incidencesof crop circle energy interfering with electronic equipment. On one occasion acamera's shutter curtain buckled upwards, something camera repair experts werelater unable to explain. This damage was followed moments later by a videocamera malfunction such that the camera had to be removed from inside the circlebefore it regained working order.News of a more scientific kind surfaced from HSC Laboratory in southern England.This lab had carried out a microscopic analysis of plants taken from cropcircles and compared them to control samples taken from elsewhere in the givenfield. As the two results were displayed side by side, the disparity proved thatwhatever had made the designs had also altered the composition of thecrystalline structure of certain minerals in the affected plants (see chapter 8[18_chapter08.html#c8]).Image [images/p19-01.jpg]Figure 1.16 Selection of pictogram crop circles from 1990.Something else about to be altered was the daily life of the inhabitants ofAlton Barnes in the heart of Wessex. During the early hours of July 12, 1990, aloud rumbling like distant thunder could be heard throughout this serene villagein the shallow Vale of Pewsey. Dogs barked incessantly and refused to stop. At2:20 A.M., farm manager Tim Carson decided to check his fields to see ifanything was amiss. As he patrolled the perimeter of his east field, anindistinct shape seemed out of place amid the wheat.When daylight broke, it revealed the imprint of a 606-foot long pictogram—acyclopean collection of circles, rings, boxes, and tridents, all connected bytwo straight avenues (see figure 1.17 on page A2 in the color section). Tocomplicate matters, twelve “grapeshot” lay in the middle of the standing cropbetween tram lines. The formation carried an unusual type of energy, because apower surge of unknown origin had left local car batteries dead.Significantly, one villager told a local newspaper reporter how he'd tried towalk into the formation at daybreak but had been repelled by an invisible energyfield. In fact, when Tim Carson later escorted a television team into the cropformation, he witnessed firsthand how the crew had to keep their equipmentoutside the circle. Every time they crossed its perimeter electromagneticinterference played havoc with the recording equipment.At last, a crop circle event made the headlines of the international news, andarticles in major newspapers enabled photos to traverse the globe, beckoningtens of thousands of visitors from as far away as Japan to descend in a kind ofpilgrimage upon rural Wiltshire. Public and media confidence in officialexplanations evaporated as crop circle fever broke out.Inside the Alton Barnes pictogram, even the traditional British reserve melted,as strangers of different classes and backgrounds conversed cheerfully with oneanother. Some even danced in and around the circles. The place turned into animpromptu carnival. Thousands felt as if a burden had been lifted off theirshoulders, yet nobody had the slightest explanation as to why. How many wereaware that one interpretation of the oversized “trident” protruding from thehead of the crop formation was a representation of Shiva's Trident—a Hindusymbol associated with transformation? This was an apt signature, consideringwhat was now unfolding as the pictogram began to exert a foothold on publicawareness. With this one elegant demonstration, were the Circlemakers unitingthe tribes of Earth in harmony?To make sure the authorities would not try to explain away this event, duringthat same night, the Circlemakers had dropped an almost identical design onto afield a mile away (see figure 1.18 on page A2 in the color section). The farmerwho was busy harvesting the ripe crop said that he'd had previous encounterswith the phenomenon but never on a scale like this. “It wasn't there when Idrove down here last evening, but appeared here during the night. I cannot thinkof anything that could do this, can you?”2My thanks to Colin Andrews/CPRI, and George Bishop/CCCS for sharing detailsfrom their extensive databases.3Unlike the Egyptian pyramids, Silbury Hill is a conical, truncated moundconstructed as a step pyramid of six levels, from layers of chalk, alternatingwith layers of clay and flint.4Plasma is superheated gas where the neutral atoms are stripped into negativelycharged electrons and positively charged ions.

WELCOME TO THE MACHINEOne can only wonder what was running through the minds of the authorities as thereserved British public continued to react to the crop circles with zest and ascarloads of families swarmed narrow lanes to catch a glimpse of new events. Whatis certain is that an awakening appears to have taken place, and Wessex,particularly the Silbury Hill area, was again, as it had been thousands of yearsbefore, a place of pilgrimage.At the top of Milk Hill, two of these pilgrims, a young couple, sat togetherbeholding the enchanting landscape. As one of them, Steve Alexander, beganvideotaping the enormous pictogram below, a small silvery object reflected backthe sunlight. Not much larger than a beach ball, it hovered at waist level,brushing the heads of the wheat as it meandered lazily but purposefully towardsa tractor working the field. The pulsating disk closed in, gained altitude, andthen suddenly disappeared into the sky. When later interviewed, the youngtractor driver described how even though a disk-shaped object had flown withinshouting distance of him, his subsequent account of his close encounter had beenmet by ridicule from friends and locals. Alexander's four-minute film wouldlater vindicate him.That wasn't by any means the only object flying around the Wiltshirecountryside. Although Wiltshire has large tracts of army training grounds,principally on Salisbury Plain, and most circlemaking activity takes place somedistance from these, camouflaged army helicopters, flying low in and aroundprivately owned fields, became a familiar sight over new crop circles, much tothe annoyance of those on the ground. Technically, flying low over private landis not a deviation from standard British army procedure, but it is hard tocomprehend how the military machine, reliant on critical timekeeping, allowstroops to take a side interest in photographing crop circles—unless, of course,the formations were under scrutiny. But how could they be? After all, thegovernment had already categorically denied the army's involvement. Givenevidence to the contrary it would seem the army was suffering from a seriouscase of joyriding helicopter pilots. Regardless, no serious explanation wasforthcoming. Given that highly intelligent whirlwinds were hardly proving apalpable explanation for recent events, the British government also remainedsuspiciously tight-lipped.Image [images/p22-01.jpg]Figures 2.1a and 2.1b A tube of light was seen descending from the sky, threehours before this four-ring Celtic cross appeared below Morgan's Hill (top).Three weeks later it was overlaid by a second design (bottom). Note how damageto the formations is only evident where visitors have disturbed the plants.Morgan's Hill, 1990.Researchers, on the other hand, now had more reason than ever to speak out. Aresearch group called the Center for Crop Circles Studies (CCCS) was assembledto amass and disseminate reams of information from scores of individuals.Andrews and Delgado followed suit with their Circles Phenomenon Research, whichlater became Andrews' CPRI (Circles Phenomenon Research International).The estimated number of crop circles during the 1990 season bordered on abreathtaking 800, and Wiltshire alone contributed 500. Now, hardly a day went bywithout the British press devoting ample column inches to the phenomenon,especially as reports began coming in from all around the British Isles, as wellas Bulgaria, Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. The unusual circumstancesmounted. For example, the night before the first of forty circles appeared inEast Anglia, reports were filed describing orange lights the size of the fullmoon. At Bickington, Devon, a circle with seven satellites appeared soon after abullet-shaped object with rows of colored lights was reported flying silentlyacross the area.On the morning of July 25, a wildlife photographer camping near Beckhampton sawa column of light shine down from the clouds at around half-past two in themorning. Shortly after dawn, a circle with a curved path was found. A few milesdown the road below Morgan's Hill, a farmhand was suddenly wakened by apiercing, trilling noise, just hours before a magnificent Celtic cross cropformation appeared. A few of these circles were accompanied either by balls oflight or tubes of light, and in all cases by that sound.In Lincolnshire, two 200-foot formations appeared over the buried location ofDurobrivae, once one of the largest towns in Roman Britain. According to thereporter from the Peterborough Evening Telegraph, the ground details were farbeyond the ability of hoaxers, as the carefully laid strands of wheat “lookedmore like they had been carefully plaited together” (Michell 1990). This levelof precision also applied to the designs: the second formation had dimensionsresulting from superimposing the elements of the first formation.Reports followed from Canada and Japan, followed by a dramatic event fromsouthern Oregon in the U.S. On August 10, 13.3 miles of the dry lake bed ofAlvord Lake was etched with lines ten inches wide and three inches deep,creating a perfect rendition of the Sri Yantra mandala.5 The “straight” linesthat made up the series of triangles were slightly bowed by eight inches, as ifthe curvature resulted from them being projected from a point high in the sky(see figures 2.2a [11_chapter02.html#fig2.2a], b [11_chapter02.html#fig2.2b]).Eventually, a group of four artists claimed responsibility, even producing avideo of themselves supposedly making the furrows of the design with a manuallydrawn garden cultivator, a job they claim took them from July 31 to August 9 tocomplete.Image [images/p23-01.jpg]Figure 2.2a This Sri Yantra mandala is made up of 13.3 miles of etched lines ondry lake bed. The tiny figures in the center are people. Oregon, 1990.Image [images/p23-02.jpg]Figure 2.2b Hindu Sri Yantra mandala. The triangles represent a series ofdiminishing harmonics.However, their efforts to replicate the precise trench with beveled edges insunbaked earth proved unconvincing, least of all because the video they releasedshowed the cultivator following suspicious dark swaths that looked likepre-existing furrows back-filled with dirt, to convince us that the ruts werebeing dug for the first time.The rest of the story seemed equally implausible. First, why would anyone travelseveral hundred miles armed with a tiller to bake in temperatures exceeding 110°F for ten days? Second, when Air National Guard pilot Bill Miller discovered theoriginal design on an overflight of the Oregon lake bed during a neardailytraining exercise, it was already complete. According to his superior officer,Capt. Michael Gollaher of the 124th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, there were nosigns of a design-inprogress, nor tire tracks leading to or from the formation.Yet when UFOlogists Dan Newman and Alan Decker drove to the site, not only werefootprints and tire tracks absent, their own van had left a 1/4-inch-deepimprint on the dry wilderness surface surrounding the mandala.6 Clearly, humaninvolvement in that “crop” formation can be ruled out.Back in Wessex, a new surveillance operation began. Between the towns ofWestbury and Bratton stands one of the many enigmatic white horse-figures carvedinto the side of the chalk hills. Above this particular carving lies the IronAge hill fort at Bratton, with its commanding view of the countryside. Cropcircles had already appeared several times here in the past, so it seemed theperfect site from which a threeweek monitoring operation could take place. LikeOperation White Crow, the idea behind Operation Blackbird, as it was called, wasfor Andrews, Delgado, and other researchers and scientists to try to catch theCirclemakers at it. A cache of a million pounds'-worth of infrared cameras,video recorders, and image intensifiers were housed in a cabin on theescarpment.Behind the ancient hill fort lay the edge of the expansive Salisbury Plain withits largely sealed-off military testing grounds, so it came as no surprise whenthe army announced its intention to join the action. Their participationincluded officially off-duty soldiers manning the adjacent hill, loaded withnight-vision equipment far superior in penetrative ability to that used in thecircle researchers' cabin. The fact that these soldiers wore camouflage uniformswas neither consistent with the designation “off-duty” nor with the army'spublicized lack of interest in crop circles. (Later, such army patrols would beseen with increasing frequency around the Silbury Hill area, and sometimes inthe private farmland that occupied advantageous viewpoints.)The first night of the Bratton surveillance went by without incident. On thesecond night, several key researchers decided to retire early. Later, theywished they hadn't.When first light broke, an imprint in the crop began to reveal itself less thana mile away below the hill fort, although given the oblique angle it was notpossible to establish its quality. When Andrews and Delgado, two of theresearchers who'd taken the night off, were telephoned, they boyishly raced backto Bratton. Up at the cabin everyone was thrilled. Finally, a real event wascaught in front of the world's media! Despite some TV reporters pushing thepossibility that perhaps they had been deceived, an understandably excited ColinAndrews announced to the press that a major event had indeed taken place.However, even though a rushed look through the night footage video suggestedthat something wasn't quite right, the world's press couldn't be kept waitingany longer.With breakfast television cameras rolling, Andrews and Delgado set out for theformation, but as they approached it, a churning feeling began to form in theirstomachs. Something looked abnormal. The characteristic vortices of the swirledcrop were missing, and the stems of the plants were broken. It was a trampledmess of clumsy circles and haphazard lines. It was a hoax.Worse was to follow. In the center of each of these ugly circles lay anastrology board game and a wooden cross. Nearby, an incriminating length of redrope had been conveniently discarded for all the cameras to see, the first timethat the “tools of the trade” had ever made an appearance. The media lapped itup and fed the deception straight to 50 million viewers at the start of theirworking day.Image [images/p25-01.jpg]Figure 2.3 A hoax allegedly perpetrated by the British military to fool theworld. Bratton, 1990.Back at the cabin, and after two hours spent analyzing the night-vision andinfrared tapes, a subdued Andrews addressed the media again: “I suppose we werealready suspicious because of what we'd seen on the video recordings. For astart, it took about twenty minutes for the circles to form, when our researchclearly shows that the real circles are there within seconds. . . . Theequipment even detected the heat from the bodies of the perpetrators.” Despiteprotestations that they had fallen prey to a crude deception, it was too late:the key figures of crop circles research had been ritually humiliated in frontof the nation, by now laughing all the way to the office.Coincidentally, during the night of the hoax—and only on that night—the soldiersand the two corporals assigned to Operation Blackbird had been conspicuous bytheir absence (Wingfield 1991b).Despite this setback, a handful of dedicated, if subdued, researchers stayedback at the cabin on the hill fort to continue the seemingly fruitless project;everyone else bolted from the hilltop stakeout. Once again, they would wish theyhadn't been so hasty. Ten days after the hoax, a swirling motion lasting lessthan fifteen seconds rippled through the wheat—caught by the night-vision cameraof Nippon TV, but tantalizingly at the very limit of its vision. It was as ifthe Circlemakers knew the limitations of the equipment but had wished toreassure those who persevered not to lose faith that here was a real phenomenon.Image [images/p25-02.jpg]Figure 2.4 Diagram of the crop circle captured on-camera following the Brattonhoax.The new crop circle—in shape, a cross between a sperm cell, a question mark, andan equiangular spiral—lay a thousand feet from the infamous hoax, but this timeno member of the TVviewing public was to share in the event. After that lastridicule, crop circles were off the media menu.It quickly became apparent that a wellplanned piece of disinformation had beenexecuted, conveniently in the presence of the world's press. Someone hadblatantly gone out of their way to rain on the Circlemakers' parade: perhaps theauthorities were concerned that crop circles had become a new religion? Afterall, enough evidence exists that faith is a wonderful tool for generating statesof excellent physical and mental health, even happiness. Fortunately, severalindividuals rose to the challenge of ferreting out the culprits. A particularlysuspicious George Wingfield was quick off the mark:“Around this time, I received a telephone call from a friend who said he had areliable contact in a high-ranking position in the military, whose name I'm notallowed to mention for understandable reasons. This man had already suppliedsensitive information in the past, which until now always proved extremelyvaluable. Now he claimed that the Bratton hoax was carried out by a speciallytrained unit of the army, and that the order came directly from the Ministry ofDefence. The operation was carefully planned, prepared in advance and carriedout in complete darkness, quickly and precisely. My informant was even able tospeak with an officer who was involved in the planning of the operation, whichhad the highest level of secrecy.”Further corroboration came from the Wiltshire-based German politicalcorrespondent, Jürgen Krönig, who was in an excellent position to gathervaluable information. His report on the first of three internal conferences heldat the Department of the Environment, attended by Members of Parliament,government scientists, and civil servants from the Ministries of Defence,Environment, and Agriculture Fisheries and Food, proved illuminating: “Thefavourite thesis of the skeptics, that the circles were but a large-scale joke,wasn't even considered. The army was instructed to keep the phenomenon underintensive observation and, if necessary, to take ‘appropriate steps.’ Finally,it was discussed how the topic should be handled in public; in this discussion,the term ‘disinformation’ was used” (Hesemann 1995).There was undoubtedly much interest in crop circles in the upper levels ofgovernment, since a number of meetings took place between ministers, the secretservices, and the military to discuss the issue. In the end, it was decided tooutwardly calm the public while further discreet investigations took place. Thisis the official approach of Western governments concerning UFOs, which followsan “educational program” adopted in 1953 by the Robertson Panel in the U.S.Project Blue Book, its protocol, officially released in 1977 under the U.S.Freedom of Information Act, describes how governments should have “two majoraims: training and debunking.”The plan was to reduce public interest in flying saucers, accomplished chieflythrough mass media such as television and motion pictures, where unexplainedphenomena were given to the realms of fantasy, allowing them to be easilyridiculed or parodied. Then, a series of editorial articles in the popular presswould seek to re-educate the public by presenting case histories where puzzlingevents were rationally explained away.However, the problem with explaining away the fantastic is that it sometimesrequires unrealistic explanations, and this policy has a history of backfiring.The best example undoubtedly is the explanation offered by the Pentagon over thediscovery of “alien bodies” at the famous UFO crash site at Roswell, New Mexico.Press statements issued in 1997 counter-claimed that local eyewitnesses had seenmannequins, dropped from airplanes in 1950 to test a new parachute prototype.These incredible parachutes appear to have had a formidable effect of slowingdown their payload, for if we are to believe this official explanation, it tooka full three years for these mannequins to reach the ground, as the Roswellcrash occurred in 1947.As for crop circle disinformation, Britishex-police-sergeant-turned-UFO-researcher Anthony Dodd did much knocking on doorsto amass additional evidence that pointed to some kind of coverup. He reported:“Local farmers had received instructions from the authorities to harvest thefields in question immediately, whether or not the corn was ripe . . . they [theauthorities] wanted to see formations gone from the fields before the publiccould examine them” (Dodd 1991).A document from the secret U.S. commission Majestic 12 was leaked to Germaneditor Michael Hesemann, showing how the CIA was seriously concerned about theeffect crop circles might have on the population, and that they had gatheredsubstantial information on all aspects of the phenomenon (Hesemann 1995).According to many sources, Majestic 12 was set up to deal with the U.S.military's most guarded secret and biggest headache. Many files claiming anMJ-12 pedigree have been “leaked” to the public, (whether this was done asinformation or disinformation is still a moot point) and disclose numerous itemsof allegedly classified information on extraterrestrial life and technologies,information that was classified “higher” than the H-bomb data.In his Conclusive Evidence, Pat Delgado features one example of an extraordinaryeffort by the U.S. military to cover up traces of a crop formation in a Kansascornfield. This included “the influx into a small town of various unmarkedgovernment vehicles shortly after the event, the setting up of road blocks, thequestioning of residents by men in suits and ties, three large, redhazardous-waste vehicles, animal-disposal vehicles, an electrified fence, theattempted discing and ploughing of the formation, and the spreading of shreddedcrops on the formation” (Delgado 1992).In a separate incident, a confidential source contacted me from upstate New Yorkand told me that a neighboring farmer had been approached by a state policeofficer and handed $500 to immediately cut a crop circle out of his field.Bizarre behavior, to say the least.But let's return to Bratton in Wessex. It is certainly feasible that thegovernment had been involved to some degree in masterminding the hoax, becausedespite intense public and media pressure on the authorities to come up with thereal cause behind crop circles, no action had been forthcoming. They simplycould not explain what was happening in rational terms. Plants weren't supposedto behave like this, so the easiest way out would be to make the wholephenomenon appear to be a series of fraudulent misdemeanors perpetrated byvandals.George Wingfield suggested that the superficially convincing hoax would have hadto be carried out early on in the surveillance project lest a real event becaught by the cameras, especially as television representatives from as far awayas Japan were present. But it seems that a hoaxed circle was not enough for theauthorities and so, to move the public mood from debate to ridicule, horoscopesand crosses were added, thus blatantly pointing the finger at New-Agers oroccultists, and lending an air of silliness to further discredit proceedings. Ifsuspicion could be cast on the validity of the whole phenomenon, then it wouldfollow that, by implication, surely all circles had been man-made.“If a hoaxer wished to achieve a masterly deception, he would not thendeliberately give the game away with these obvious signs that the circles wereman-made,” wrote Wingfield. “In reporting the hoax, the BBC said that theobjects suggested some kind of ritual . . . no ritualist would conceivablyperform under such circumstances, in front of a massive surveillance operation.. . . And who, after all, would happen to have six horoscope game-boards on handunless all had been wellprepared in advance” (Wingfield 1991b)?The use of game boards would also have ensured that Delgado and Andrews wouldnot declare the crop formation to be genuine, so this was a shrewd move.In hindsight, a lax remark to the press by one of the army corporals prior tothe hoax at Bratton seemed to sum it all up: “We are here to prove that thecircles are caused by people. The scientists are here to prove otherwise.”The military, not surprisingly, had shown a lack of interest in the study andanalysis of the Bratton circles, but fifteen miles away, the set of circles thatappeared on the same evening received intense scrutiny from an army detachmentwhich included a WISP, a miniature remote-controlled helicopter. Militarysurveillance of new circles would continue for three weeks.Image [images/p28-01.jpg]Figure 2.5 “Dolphinograms.”The formations kept coming. A 600-foot pictogram materialized nine miles awayfrom Bratton, beside East Kennett long barrow. In fact, dozens of formationswere found just as the crops were being harvested by the combines; when all thegrain fields had been cut in Southern England, those in the north were stilldisplaying all manner of markings.But no matter, the goal of disinformation had been effectively carried out. Fromnow on, barely a pip would be heard from the media or the public about cropcircles. No government explanation would be required. Everything was again undercontrol.The spring of 1991 was accompanied by unusually wet weather in southern England,leaving crops in a relative state of immaturity, and making the new crop circleseason splutter and stall until June before finally gathering steam.The new designs appeared inconsistent with the ordered, fluid progression of theCirclemakers' language up to this point. These took on the shape of“insectograms”—designs based on combinations of circles connected by pathways(dumbbells) from which “antennae” sprouted, as well as legs and ladders, givingthe impression of dancers or insects. While some considered that these designscontained a serious message, for others they conveyed a jest, as if tocounteract the seriousness of the politics now surrounding the subject. Fiveinsectograms materialized between June and August: three in equidistant, almostlinear, field locations across Hampshire; a fourth was placed on the samelatitude as Stonehenge; the fifth arrived twenty-one miles to the west, oppositeStonehenge itself in a field that would later host the “Julia Set.”Other impressive crop formations came in the shape of 300-foot long, elongateddumbbells, some with an attachment resembling a key (see figure 2.8 on page A4in the color section), and still others suggesting whales, turtles, or dolphins.They also came in pairs of virtual carbon copies, which according to accurateground surveys, showed the discrepancy between copies as a minuscule 0.6–0.9percent.7 Such critical measuring by surveyors became crucial to later research:a dumbbell at Beckhampton encoded the Moon's diameter, as well as the mass ratiobetween Earth and the Moon; a second, this time at Silbury Hill, encoded 19.47°,the latitude at which energy upwells in a “hot spot” on many planets in oursolar system (see figure 2.9 [11_chapter02.html#fig2.9]).8Image [images/p29-01.jpg]Figure 2.6 Selection of crop circles from 1991. Second row: “insectograms.”In June, a radio operator named Dilling in Bulberry Down, Devon, was listeningto Radio Moscow and Voice of America when the broadcast was suddenly drowned outby a series of highpitched blips and clicks. Dilling knew the origin of suchnoises because he'd heard them before, at the time when crop circles appeared.The following morning, a new seventy-five-foot circle and ring was visible in anearby field.At Lapworth, eighty miles north of the regular circle activity, a farmer wassurprised to find that twenty-five of his sheep had managed to cross the barbedwire fence and were wandering about in an agitated manner. The large oak treethat stood beside the fresh crop circle began to show some unusual behavior aswell: the leaves facing the circle had begun to change color abruptly, fromsummer green to early autumn yellow. The farmer also reported how the stalkswere flattened perfectly despite the young age of the plants, which have anatural tendency to rise. A scientist also found electromagnetic energy linesconnecting the crop circle with sixty nearby churches (Delgado 1992).Image [images/p30-01.jpg]Figure 2.7 Triple “dumbbell.” Froxfield, 1990.Image [images/p30-02.jpg]Figure 2.9 Left: Myers and Percy discovered critical measurements relating tothe Earth and the moon encoded in this dumbbell. Beckhampton, 1991. Right: Inthis design they found a reference to 19.47°, the latitude at which energyup-wells on many planets in our solar system. Silbury, 1991.So, despite the odd hoax, the Circlemakers remained active and innovative, andthe continued circle activity spurred yet another surveillance project. AtMorgan's Hill, Wiltshire, the new research group set up specialized equipment,including a remote-controlled camera and ultra-sensitive directionalmicrophones. The monitored field suffered a further invasion of its privacy byhaving its perimeter rigged with an alarm system to detect the presence of anyintruder.By three-thirty in the morning, damp clouds developed into a fine mist thatscreened the entire field. When dawn broke shortly after, the Sun quickly burnedthrough the drapes of fog to reveal a pristine formation, yet nothing had beencaught by the monitoring equipment. By the time the first person reached theformation, his clothes had become heavy from soaking up the dew, his boots cakedin mud. But once again, no tracks, no damage, no mud on the plants, saidresearcher Mike Currie. “It was as if a conjurer had spread a large silkhandkerchief over the table, waved his hands, whipped the handkerchief aside andproduced, by magic, a white rabbit” (Wingfield 1991b).Image [images/p31-01.jpg]Figure 2.10 “Now Explain This One.” The Barbury Castle tetrahedron.Upping the stakes, the Circlemakers decided it was time to pay a visit to theBritish Prime Minister's residence at Chequers. The stately home stands within ahighly secured perimeter of prime Buckinghamshire countryside, guarded by elitesecurity teams and state-of-the-art technology. One can only guess the guard'sreaction upon discovering the large Celtic cross-type pattern that lay in fullview of the property and barely a hundred yards away from the house. One of itsfour circles had been replaced by an arrow pointing directly at the residence,then in use by John Major of the Conservative Party. A trident emanated from oneof the avenues like a signature. Remember that Hindu symbol, the trident ofShiva?Putting on a brave face in front of the local press, John Major's PR teambrushed off claims that security had been breached in any way and said that thesymmetrical markings were nothing more than a meteorological phenomenon. Thiswas a notch up from the previous administration, as the equally ConservativeThatcher had blamed crop circles on poor soil conditions.Back in Wiltshire, the town of Wroughton had been having its own share ofexcitement. During the night of July 16, the town suddenly found itself withoutelectricity. The nearby military base also suffered a total blackout and,consequently, scrambled its helicopters. At the same time, residents around thenearby hill fort of Barbury Castle witnessed the by-now common aerial display ofsmall, brightly colored flying objects, followed by what many described as a lowrumbling noise, akin to that heard at Alton Barnes the previous year. Nextmorning, having given up interest in crop circles, the British press woke upagain: “Now Explain This One,” exclaimed the headlines.Image [images/p32-01.jpg]Figure 2.11 “To create a Mandelbrot Set, one needs a computer.” Until August1991, that is. Ickledon.Occupying 12,000 square yards lay a labyrinthine design, a collection ofcircles, rings, and curious circular features connected by paths making theshape of a triangle. What became known as the Barbury Castle tetrahedron (seefigure 2.10 [11_chapter02.html#fig2.10]) marked a quantum leap in crop circleevolution, because here was an unmistakable and identifiable philosophical andalchemical symbol representing the very creation of Universal matter.9 Notsurprisingly, the mesmerizing power of the glyph cajoled the press out of itstired cynicism with a jolt, provoking a knee-jerk reaction from the army whichblocked access to local roads, an act that blatantly overstepped their peacetimejurisdiction in Britain.Image [images/p32-02.jpg]Figure 2.12 A fractal is a computer-generated figure in which an identical motifrepeats itself on an ever-diminishing scale. One of the most complex objects inmathematics, the Mandelbrot Set marks the boundary between order and chaos.Ironically, mathematicians say that it also marks the boundary where classicalscience stops.The symbolism of the formation, reinforced by its strategic location amidst theNeolithic landscape, was not lost on scholars of esotericism who would be busywith analysis for years, or on those examining the connection between geometryand energy, as this crop glyph's design contained yet another coded reference to19.47°.That the Circlemakers were also determined to bring orthodox scholars into thering was evidenced by a matching major event on the opposite side of thecountry, this time in the heart of the scientific community's territory. Not farfrom Cambridge University, where French mathematician and fractal theoristBenoit Mandelbrot had taught earlier in the century, another showpiece cropglyph made its mark. Unmistakable to mathematicians, it appeared to be arepresentation of the Mandelbrot Set, a fractal pattern discovered by theFrenchman as part of a mathematical model explaining chaos theory. The cropformation was mathematically perfect.In fact, it was unbelievably perfect for some of the University'smathematicians, who were suddenly drawn into the debate. Responses abounded:“Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air,” claimedprominent scientist Steven Hawking.10 Other scientists put the whole thing downto a student prank. But New Scientist, Britain's respected science weekly,brought some balance and objectivity to the drama and admitted that it wasimpossible to construct this, the most complicated object in mathematics,without the aid of a computer and a great deal of time.The precision of this Mandelbrot Set, New Scientist wrote, was carefully studiedon the ground by a local agronomist and biologist named Wombwell: “It wasincredibly precise. Each circle was perfect, the wheat flattened clockwise, andat the base of the heart-shape it tapered down to a single stalk of wheat. Everystalk had been flattened one quarter of an inch above the soil. There were nofootmarks, and no sign of machinery” (Davis 1992).Beth Davis, historian and founder-member of the CCCS, who surveyed the formationjust hours before its rapid decapitation at the hands of a defiant farmer,observed a new characteristic feature in the lay of plants: “. . . thestretching or expanding of each band of laid wheat to accommodate to theasymmetry of the form, with several radii from the center node. The two pendantcircles have anticlockwise and clockwise floor patterns” (Davis 1992). As withprevious formations, this one lay within shouting distance of barrows andnumerous other prehistoric features.On the night the formation appeared, a local woman was driving in the vicinitywith her son at 1:15 A.M. The car was followed by a silveryblue light spherewhich flew within thirty feet of the two bewildered occupants before vanishing.The following morning the Mandelbrot Set was discovered by a pilot flying hisregular route to work. It hadn't been there the day before.In an incredible coincidence, the formation itself had appeared exactly a yearto the day after an article published in New Scientist stated: “With eachsummer, the crop circle formations become more complex. How long before we willsee a complete Mandelbrot diagram” (Hughes 1990)?5Yantra is a Sanskrit word meaning “geometric power diagram,” Sri means “exaltedor divine.” It is said that contemplation of this symbol brings enlightenment.This crop circle “mandala” was discovered a month after the Alton Barnespictogram of July 11th, with its trident of Shiva, another symbol oftransformation.6James Deardorff 1991.

OF CIRCLEMAKERS AND CIRCLE FAKERSWith a portfolio now bolstered by complex mathematical diagrams, 1991 had proveda good year both for crop circles and for the handful of dedicated individualsaiming to make the public aware of them. At least the discussion of crop circlespermeated the public forum once again. Even if the Bratton incident had left theimpression that “pagan worshippers” were responsible for misusing the nation'sgrain, or if newspapers such as the Observer stated that “Britain's crop circlesare caused by squabbling birds,” the latest crop formations had left us with aseries of events beyond the scope of what human involvement could accomplish.Circle fever erupted again, and so, on September 9, Britain's Today newspaperoffered an antidote: “The Men Who Conned the World.” At sixty-seven andsixty-two years of age, respectively, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley must haveseemed like the world's most active sexagenarians, as the popular daily paperpublished their remarkable claim to be the makers of all crop circles. Accordingto the report (which ran for three days), the duo described how thirteen years'worth of crop circles had all been done effortlessly by them with a plank ofwood, a bit of string, and some help from the moonlight.More incredible was their home-made adaptation of a baseball cap equipped with abent wire frame which, they claimed, was used as a sight-line to help constructperfectly straight lines in the dark by referencing distant objects. Butresearcher George Wingfield wisely pointed out the flaws in this theory: “Toreally make straight lines one needs a backsight and a foresight attached to theinstrument with which one makes the lines. These would both have to be kept inalignment with the remote object. Even with Doug's head set rigidly in cement,the baseball cap method would never allow one to keep straight, even if onecould sight on a remote object at night” (Wingfield 1990).The contraption sounded as absurd as their story. Other claims were equally outof this world: When later quizzed about the technique they had employed tocreate the four rectangular boxes in standing crop on the first Chilcombpictogram without signs of entry, Bower and Chorley replied that they jumped orpolevaulted and the features were a result of their landing. Unfortunately, tojump from a standing position inside a tram line, this technique would requirean Olympian leap of more than eleven feet, or an improbable thirty-five feet inthe case of grapeshot circles, which the two also claimed to have created withthe same novel technique.Apparently they had managed to keep their nocturnal activities secret from theirwives for more than a decade (supposedly due to their wives being heavysleepers). This, in addition to the colossal mileage added to their vehicles,the mud and pollen-stained clothes—supposedly their spouses had missed all theseclues of abnormal behavior during the first thirteen years of their activities,only to become extremely suspicious in 1991.The Bower-Chorley scam had apparently been the product of a boring evening atthe pub in 1978; they did it “for a laugh.” Their selfconfessed motivation toimprove the designs from year to year was a defiant reaction to theever-increasing seriousness of “so-called” crop circle researchers. “It was likebeing high—we couldn't stop,” the two embellished for Today.Image [images/p35-01.jpg]Figure 3.1 A crop circle made in front of the world's media by Doug and Davedemonstrating their ability to accurately re-create flattened, spiraled crop.Morestead, 1991.Image [images/p35-02.jpg]Figure 3.2 Straight lines are used to mark the initial outline of a hoaxed cropcircle. The rest is then filled in, much like a child learning to draw. OvertonHill, 2000.But now they had gotten too old, and manipulating tens of thousands of squarefeet of wheat proved too exhausting. Besides, their consciences got to them andthey couldn't lie to their wives any longer: “When we heard the governmentwanted to make funds available for further research into the phenomenon,” saidDoug, “we both had the feeling one could use the money better for artificialkidneys and heart transplants.”Their heartfelt concern would have been touching had it not been for the factthat, throughout the 1980s, British government policy had starved healthcare andother essential public services of funds. It seems incredulous that money savedthrough the elimination of buses and hospital beds be diverted to fund what thegovernment had claimed all along was nothing more than a meteorologicalphenomenon.The Doug and Dave diatribe went on and on. For a public unfamiliar with thetechnicalities behind the phenomenon, their story went down like vintage port.Finally, a human face was produced which seemingly explained the whole fuss.There were no little green men, nor any message of impending doom from God, justtwo eccentric old jokers.But the immediate purpose of the scam appears to have been the continuingdiscrediting of the research community. Following the national embarrassment atBratton, Andrews decided to move to Connecticut to continue his research inpeace, only to have secret agents attempt an infiltration of his home, hisfamily, and the world's largest crop circles database. Meaden and Taylor weretricked on camera into declaring a hoax to be genuine. As a key public member ofthe CCCS, Wingfield was progressively sidetracked into fighting lies andaccusations from all angles, leaving Pat Delgado as the last figure of cropcircles research yet to be humiliated.“Come on, Pat, admit you were had!” the headline screamed. Pat had devoted histime and money unselfishly for over a decade to educate the world about the mostincredible event on Earth in living memory. He had taken the matter toBuckingham Palace and kept the British Parliament abreast of the latestresearch, all in the best interests of humanity. His sacrifice had been total,but now he in turn was being pilloried.The man who introduced Doug and Dave, reporter Graham Brough of Today, invitedDelgado to examine a new crop circle in a field in Kent at dusk; it was arepetition of the insectogram designs of that year. The ex-NASA engineercasually told the reporter that it was well-formed and appeared at first sightto be genuine. The reporter duly left the scene and Delgado continued to examinethe design in the failing light. But after conducting some tests forelectromagnetism, Delgado felt less sure about the pictogram's authenticity.Brough later presented the two “field artists” at Delgado's home claiming theyhad made the formation, and all others before it. Aggravated by this transparentmedia stunt and the barrage of Gestapo-style psychological questioning, Delgadodefensively stated, “If this was a hoax then it is another case of some of thepeople being fooled some of the time. Do not forget that in many differentsubjects throughout history, experts have been fooled and will probably continueto be so.”But to no avail. The setup worked, despite the serious lack of evidencepresented. Incredibly, even the newspaper's photographer hadn't bothered to takephotos of either the various stages of construction or of any referencing of thelocal topography while the pair supposedly “made” the formation; so, for all weknow, the crop circle could already have been there. Brough managed to extractenough statements from his victim to make a story for the paper, whose readersfell for the crude deception. Today then issued a worldwide press releaseclaiming that Delgado had stated that all crop circles were hoaxes—a completelie. Inexplicably, the story was posted to countries where most people had neverheard of a crop circle, much less seen one (Delgado 1992).A thoroughly dedicated human being was unnecessarily humiliated by the Doug andDave scam. After that, Pat Delgado hung up his cap and continued his researchquietly away from the public eye.Funny how two insects can damage so much grain.Yet not everyone appears to have been duped. One saving grace came from thequality British newspaper, the Independent: “I find it easier to believe inlittle green men than in this story by Bower and Chorley,” quoted one columnist,and a Swiss newspaper was equally skeptical of the whole episode. These papersmay have been referring to the press demonstration later held by Today in whichDoug and Dave were paraded in front of TV cameras to show the world theirprowess at their field art. The results from the first hour of work were onecomplete circular mess—no swirls, no undamaged plants. So they tried again, thistime for two hours.Again, they achieved the same results: indistinct edges, imprecise alignments,and so forth. Doug and Dave's cosmic artwork resembled the site of a chanceencounter between two sexually aroused elephants—with all due respect toelephants.Some members of the press were nonplussed, but many others felt the patheticdemonstration constituted all the proof they needed, and returned to their desksto subject further newsprint space to poor reporting. The U.S. media acceptedthe story at face value. Time magazine regurgitated the Today articles, andABC's Peter Jennings dished out the same to millions of viewers without anyquestion as to the story's authenticity. Four weeks later, this anchorman alsoannounced that the Soviet Union was to sell Lenin's embalmed body, a statementfor which he was subsequently made to apologize. Curiously, no such retractionwas ever made for the Doug and Dave story, even though their testimony wasquickly breaking apart in Britain.Despite having had his best friend figuratively shot down, Colin Andrewsremained stoically objective throughout the incident. With pieces of hardevidence from his database yet to be released publicly, he quizzed Doug, Dave,and Brough regarding claims that had been made.Constructed the first crop circles in 1978, had they?“Yes,” they said.A flick through Circular Evidence, the most authoritative public referencesource around, proved this to be the date of the first crop circle to beanalyzed in the book. “So then who made all these?” Andrews confronted, pullingout a set of photos from 1972. In fact, crop circles were not a modernphenomenon; 298 cases exist prior to 1980, with one dating to 1590. Onlyrecently has this information been published (T. Wilson 1998).No, they hadn't done those.Faked all 200 circles since 1978, had they?“Yes.”Then who made the remaining 2,000 or so?No answer.Had they been active around the Avebury area? There was an ominous feel to thequestion.“No, never have been.”The twosome shuffled their feet. Avebury had been the most active area since1988.How had they consistently avoided detection by farmers, campers, researchers,surveillants, guard dogs, night cameras, infrared detectors, and alarm systems?How had they made the unusual ground features on the Celtic cross patternfeatured on the cover of Circular Evidence? Not surprisingly, they adamantlyclaimed it was theirs, but in this formation the lay of the crop in the outerring transformed from a linear flow to an unusual sine wave. And what about thecolossal Barbury Castle tetrahedron? How did they do the Alton Barnes pictogramand an identical one a mile away during the same night?An assortment of replies followed, ranging from “No” to “Not sure” (how can theynot be sure of where they were?) with a smattering of “No, we didn't do thatone.”During the cross-examination, Peter Renwick, the host farmer of the Todaysponsored Doug and Dave PR outing, remarked on the pair's handiwork: “You cansee from the corn's lying that something mechanical has actually caused that,it's been caused by people trampling it. The ones I've seen are not like that;they are much flatter, flat as a pancake. This may be some of the answer, butnot all of it” (McNish 1991).However, at the time, there were no real crop circles which the press could usefor comparison. Unsurprisingly, the convenient September timing of the Todayexposé was such that all the fields had been harvested.The body of the hoaxers' story hemorrhaged as more previously unpublishedrevelations from Andrews' database tore away at their claims. The pair hadsupposedly made a formation in the same field at Cheesefoot Head every year forthe past fourteen years, yet records indicate this claim to be false; at onepoint, the struggling duo started attributing previously claimed patterns toother groups of copycat hoaxers. The patient and evercharitable Andrews gave thecornered pair further benefit of the doubt when they claimed to have made thesimple circle at Headbourne Worthy in 1986, even though Andrews sworehand-on-heart that the floor lay was so complex it had to have been genuine. Ithad taken two days just to draw.This is Andrews' description of the detail:The surface swirl was anti-clockwise and towards the center, which in itself isunusual. Most circles start at the center and move outwards towards theperiphery, with all the plants lying together. This one had a top and bottomlayer of plants, flowing in multiple directions. The surface plants had abrushed effect and consisted of a thin outer band which flowed to the periphery;at the band's inner edge, the plants diverged toward the center and flowedinwards toward a perfect center point. The point where the plants diverged, onetowards the center, the other towards the periphery, formed a ten degree angle.When lifting up the surface plants I found two sine waves, 180 degrees out ofphase and each emerging from the peak of a single sine wave around the outerband (Andrews and Delgado 1990).So, did they make this one?“No.”None of this ever reached the public.That the two men had made a handful of circles has never been in doubt. As aresult of the Bratton incident, hoaxes by copycats, cynics, sociopaths, andgeneral pranksters began appearing, accounting for an estimated fifteen percentof known formations at the time. The significant rise in hoaxing appears to havemushroomed after 1990, ignited by the intense media interest. It therefore seemsirrational that Doug and Dave, or anyone else, for that matter, should havepersevered with such an endeavor when most of their work not only wentunrecognized for nearly two decades, but was often positioned in such obscurelocations that only a chance observation by an attentive pilot would have givenits existence away. It is worth remembering that the point of being an artist isto have your work seen.If there was one positive outcome of the hoaxes, they at least provided astandard against which to measure the real article.But the bigger question here was this: Who had masterminded this highlyeffective stunt? Andrews detected the fragrance of deception all over theincident. He recalled how a colleague, a CBS reporter, was warned by a Frenchgovernment scientist that the British government would soon be presenting twopeople to the press as the makers of all crop circles.During a lecture to the Foreign Press Association, Delgado asked Brough toexplain a copyright line that appeared discreetly at the bottom of the originalDoug and Dave story: “Today has paid no money. © MBF Services.” The nervousreporter explained that the words had been added as a joke; if true, this is aviolation of journalistic standards.Wingfield, too, decided it was again time to make serious inquiries. WithToday's deputy editor Lloyd Turner on the phone, Wingfield referred him to theodd copyright line. “It is only an agency which had checked the details for us .. . a totally independent press agency, nothing else, a freelance press agency,”replied the voice at the other end. “But they brought us in contact with thesepeople, and hence they have the copyright.” (Turner later claimed he hadinvented MBF solely to protect the copyright of the Today story. Since thiscontradicts his earlier statement, it is obvious that in one case he has nottold the truth.)11Graham Brough, on the other hand, wasn't so charitable about divulginginformation. When Wingfield asked for the address and phone number of MBF, Boughhung up.It looked as if some digging around was going to be necessary.Two nuggets of information were eventually unearthed concerning these mysteriousinitials. The first concerned MacFarlane Business Forms, Ltd., of Scotland, acompany that supplied rubber stamps for the British government. Was it alsorubber-stamping an operation that debunked supernatural phenomena? The secondconcerned MBF Consultancy, a research and development facility in Somerset; thisseemed a more likely candidate.Wingfield recalled a conversation regarding methods of disinformation he'd hadwith another of his acquaintances, a friend who had worked for MI5 (a departmentof the British Secret Service). “. . . I was involved in it when MI5 circulateddisinformation around the world concerning the Northern Ireland conflict. Forthis purpose we founded a seemingly private press agency, on whose desks our ownpeople sat . . . [Handing out a telephone number] was to be avoided at allcosts. If this proved impossible, a special number was arranged on the end ofwhich one of our men sat.”Wingfield persevered. He followed the trail to Somerset and learned that MBFConsultancy was a scientific research and development company whose co-owner,Dr. Andrew Clifford, is a scientist with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering andmetallurgy. In the ensuing conversation, Dr. Clifford explained to Wingfieldthat his work was confidential in nature, done principally for the Ministry ofDefence, and some of it involving the U.S.'s “Star Wars” military program. Butwhen asked about his relationship to Doug and Dave, Today newspaper, or themythical MBF press agency, Dr. Clifford denied any connection whatsoever.12The trail ends here, and it has not been possible to further establish theconnection between the British government and Doug and Dave's debunking tactics.And since we are dealing with an institution which even keeps the number of penscirculating throughout its offices a secret, the situation is unlikely tochange.11From personal communications with Pat Delgado and George Wingfield.

PHYSICAL FEATURES OF CROP CIRCLESAs we explore the events that have shaped the crop circles phenomenon, let'stake a moment to look at the physical features that define genuine crop circlesand at how these differ from natural or human-made phenomena.Bends: One copyright feature of the Circlemakers is the anomalous bend thatcauses plants to do what they do. It has never been replicated by people. Thefeature is alien to farmers, and plant biologists cannot account for it. It is amystery created by a technique mostly unknown to us at present.The action of plants bending toward the ground contradicts their naturalfunction, so the effect is all the more mysterious in crops such as canola.Canola (oilseed rape in the UK) is fleshy and brittle by nature, the hardestpart of its stem being the fibrous segment at the base. Therefore, any attemptat bending it results in the plant snapping like celery. The same applies to aCanadian crop circle in Indian corn (maize in the UK) whose stems are close to1-1/2 inches thick and require the full weight of a man just to flatten onestalk (T. Wilson 1998). Canadian corn crops are sometimes chemically treated tofurther increase resistance to the unobstructed prairie wind; their stems arecane-like, and as you'll know if you've ever had one whacked on your head byyour kid brother, they are inflexible. Yet large portions of Canadian fieldshave succumbed to the bending effect as if descended upon by a busload of UriGellers.Image [images/p41-01.jpg]Figure 4.1 Bend in wheat.Image [images/p42-01.jpg]Figure 4.2 Young barley rising due to phototropism six days after it wasflattened. Sugar Hill, 1999.The bend often creates another anomaly. Slide your hand under a section offlattened stems and you will find them stiff and resistant to being raised, asif they've been softened like molten glass in a furnace, allowing them to begently worked and rehardened into their new and very permanent position. Butdespite this seemingly traumatic experience, the plants remain alive and well.If they are not crushed, the flattened plants rise two to seven days after beinglaid down (depending on their maturity), as a result of phototropism, thenatural process that allows plants to rise towards the Sun. However, sincephototropism generally works on the plant's nodes nearest the Sun, cases wherethe plants have risen selectively at every node, and in geometric configurations(such as the forty-eight spokes and seven concentric rings at Corhampton)suggest that at some level an outside force has manipulated the natural processand programmed the plants to rise in organized patterns.Image [images/p42-02.jpg]Figure 4.3 Despite requiring two different-size radii, the precision in the tipof this crescent is laserlike. Danebury, 1998.Image [images/p42-03.jpg]Figure 4.4 A pair of well-definied “grapeshot.”The Circlemakers have created the bend in wheat, canola, barley, rye, andlinseed. They've also made liberal use of it in sorghum and prairie grass (inthe U.S. Midwest), rice (Japan), and trees (Wisconsin and Ontario, Canada).Recent research adds grass, tobacco, brussels sprouts, potatoes, sugar beets,and strawberry plants to this list (T. Wilson 1998), but whether some of theseare part of the same phenomenon remains unclear. I include them in the interestsof reference and open-mindedness. Non-plant substances that seem to havereceived the same formative energy include snow (Afghanistan), ice (Russia,U.S., Canada), encrusted sand (Egypt), and dry lake bed earth (Oregon).Image [images/p43-01.jpg]Figure 4.5 How curving walls flute precisely down to one standing stalk.“Scorpion,” 1994.Image [images/p43-02.jpg]Figure 4.6 Hoaxers have difficulty in re-creating circular precision. Sussex,1992.Image [images/p43-03.jpg]Figure 4.7 Poor definition of hoaxed crop circle. Overton Hill, 2000.Walls: Other than the bend in the stems and the shape in the crop itself, thecirclemaking force leaves behind no visible imprint. This force is capable ofincising pictograms containing over a thousand elements with surgical precision,covering areas up to 150,000 square feet, and with such unerring accuracy that“curtains” of wheat one stalk wide are sometimes all that separate one circlefrom another. The perimeter walls resemble the seamless curve of a drum, andwhere in ward-curving walls meet inside a design, the central point can bedefined down to a single stalk. (See figure 4.5 [13_chapter04.html#fig4.5].)By comparison, human-made circles tend to leave a series of jerks andundulations along the perimeter wall, the effect becoming more pronounced thegreater the length of string or wire employed. This is particularly true if thestring is allowed to stretch or drop, or if the central pole wobbles, and wherecircles touch, an overlapping of areas often occurs due to inaccuracies inmeasurement.Image [images/p44-01.jpg]Figure 4.8 Some of the myriad floor lays: (a) Golden Mean spiral single-turnswirl; (b) Multi-swirl; (c) “S” swirl; (d) Clockwise swirl withcontra-rotational outer band; (e) Unusual radial burst, sometimes beginning as asmall swirl; (f) Radial pattern with rotational outer band; (g) The WinterbourneStoke “swastika”; (h) Multi-swirl patterns of 1987, precursors to the designpossibilities of the late 1990s; (i) Selective and directional ability of latercomplex geometric shapes. (Diagrams E to H adapted from Andrews and Delgado'ssurveys.)Image [images/p44-02.jpg]Figure 4.9 How one error in measuring cascades into a total mess. Hoaxed “Flowerof Life,” Alton Priors, 1997.Floors: Before the advent of complicated pictograms, the crop circle picturelanguage consisted of simple circles or multiples of them. Although relativelyuninspiring by today's standards, their simplicity of design enables us toappreciate the intricacy of their floors. Had all formations been constructedaccording to one format, probably no investigation would have progressed beyondMeaden's atmospheric vortex theory (Meaden 1991). But the fact that plants inearly circles exhibited all manner of organized directional flow confirms thatan intelligently guided source was at work.The most basic example of floor lay (the alignment of plants along the groundafter they have been flattened)—and the foundation of nearly every cropcircle—is the spiral, a form fundamental to nature. The natural spiral isexpressed in the Golden Mean ratio of mathematics (its numerical analog beingthe Fibonacci Series). In crop circles this spiral requires anything from 9/10of a rotation to six full rotations of spiral motion before touching the outerwall, the number of spirals depending upon the size of the circle. On closeexamination of such a spiral, one can see how it is made up of thin strips, notthree-foot-wide swaths, the latter typically being evidence of hoaxers' planksor garden rollers. Because it so closely follows specific natural laws, thespiral shape in crop circles is practically impossible to hoax successfully.Image [images/p45-01.jpg]Figure 4.10 Undamaged crop circle with single revolution clockwise spiral. Notehow the center is actually offset to the right. Callington, 1993.Figure 4.8 [13_chapter04.html#fig4.8] shows examples of floor spirals; some wereinitially noted in the meticulous early surveys of Andrews, Delgado, Meaden, andMrzyglod (Andrews and Delgado 1991). With the development of the pictograms, thefloor lays also developed into a library of designs of evermore complex shapes,but always with the humble spiral as a starting point. As the crop formationsfurther expanded in complexity, so too have the spirals. In the year 2000, anoctagonal formation at Silbury Hill had a sixtyfoot diameter central spiraloverlaid with four smaller double spirals at various points, each effectivelycreating infinity symbols.The complexity of floor lays continues beneath the surface. Peel back the firstlayer, and chances are you will find a second one beneath, placed in counterflowand creating a unique woven texture. The 1990 Alton Priors pictogram exhibitedthree layers of counterflow, while a formation at Jaywick, Essex, was fivelayers deep.Image [images/p46-01.jpg]Figure 4.12 Man-made swirl. Overton Hill, 2000.When self-confessed circle hoaxer Jim Schnabel was asked to create a patternfeaturing this layered effect in immature crop, he declined, stating that it wasimpossible to do so in undeveloped plants. Little did he know that only theprevious day such an effect had been witnessed in a beautiful formation atGoodworth Clatford which, according to a report, was “the most breathtakingcomplex interweaving of stems, as the radially laid wheat burst from the circle,meeting the outside ring, and creating the most elaborate interlacing in thespringy, undamaged crop” (Pringle 1993a).Image [images/p46-02.jpg]Figure 4.13 The rise in complex glyphs requires evermore complex plant lay.Here, a clockwise path has split to the right, the crop gradually combed into afunnel effect, creating a thin passage between two circular standing walls.Liddington hill fort, 1996.Detailing: As an art director by trade, one of the greatest delights in cropcircles for me is in the way the plants are intricately whorled into bundles intheir centers. These are deft touches reminiscent of old-world craftsmanship,like ribbons fashioned into handmade bows around a parcel, conveying a sense ofpersonality and care.The “Triple Julia Set” formation makes a perfect example, since everypossibility of plant arrangement was displayed in each of its 198 circles—a kindof candy store for cerealogists. The “wreath” (see figure 4.17[13_chapter04.html#fig4.17] on page 48.) is exactly what the name implies: atightly rotated strand of plants, about four inches thick, where the stems aredensely interwoven around a central core and raised above the surrounding floorlay. The extreme angle of the rotation means the seed heads end up meeting theroots. Any attempt to pry these plants apart will destroy them; the “bird nest”(figure 4.18 [13_chapter04.html#fig4.18]) is a variation of the above. The “canehut” (figure 4.19 [13_chapter04.html#fig4.19]) is simply charming: plants in acircular area roughly one foot wide have collapsed toward the periphery,approximately six inches above the soil, creating an enclosure resembling anAfrican cane hut.The central standing clump varies in size, from as little as six inches indiameter to thirty feet, but in some cases it consists of seven or eight lonelystems around which an entire circle wraps itself (see figure 4.20[13_chapter04.html#fig4.20]). Other unusual features of the circlemaking processinclude the “dorsal fin” (figure 4.21 [13_chapter04.html#fig4.21]), in which abunch of inflowing lay (where the floor flows toward the center) suddenly risesout of the floor and wraps itself in a very tight whirl motion resembling alogarithmic spiral. The “teardrop” closely follows the “wreath,” but is rotatedin the shape of two mirror-image Golden Mean spirals (figure 4.22[13_chapter04.html#fig4.22]).Image [images/p47-01.jpg]Figure 4.15 In genuine crop circles, the straight line is often an illusionachieved by laying the plants in subtle wave motions. “Pentagrams,” Beckhampton,1998.The Flattening Process: Another stock-in-trade characteristic of crop circles isthe way in which their creation process leaves the plants undamaged, unbruised,and unbuckled. These trademarks can be verified on location to helpdifferentiate hoaxes from the real thing.Despite the flattening, it is often possible to insert your hand between thelayers of plants and the ground, and where the head of the crop touches theground, you will not find any imprint of pressed plants in the soil. The plantsin genuine crop circles also exhibit a springiness to the point where you canwalk over freshly laid crop and feel the air getting squeezed out between swirland soil, and detect a sharp crunching sound underfoot.13Image [images/p47-02.jpg]Figure 4.16 “Catherine Wheel” effect shows one half of the spiral riding up thecircular wall in nine segments. “Koch fractal,” Silbury, 1997.Image [images/p48-01.jpg]Figure 4.17 Wreath.Image [images/p48-02.jpg]Figure 4.18 Bird nest.Image [images/p48-03.jpg]Figure 4.19 Cane hut.Image [images/p48-04.jpg]Figure 4.20 Splayed central clump.Image [images/p48-05.jpg]Figure 4.21 Dorsal fin.Image [images/p48-06.jpg]Figure 4.22 Teardrop.Since the involvement of humans or mechanical equipment would compress the soilbeneath the plants, it should be remembered that an interesting feature of theWessex soil (predominantly composed of chalk) is the prevalence of small chalkballs that even a young child can crumble between his fingers. Yet lift theplant layers and these globules can be seen sitting there uncrushed.Alternatively, when a formation appears on soil containing small, sharp rockssuch as flint (a common feature throughout southern England), the perpendicularstems rest atop the rocks without leaving crease marks, which again is not thecase if weight is involved, as it would be in hoaxed circles.Image [images/p49-01.jpg]Figure 4.23 Intact canola flowers indicate lack of damage. “Eclipse” glyph,Nether Wallop, 1999.Image [images/p49-02.jpg]Figure 4.24 A row of less mature plants stands unaffected by the flatteningprocess. “Pentagrams,” Beckhampton, 1998.When left to their own devices, the plants continue to grow and ripen. This isespecially important when canola is involved, since any bruising either preventsthe delicate, yellow flowers from blooming or causes them to die.Where formations appear in a mature crop, one often sees single rows of greenerplants standing upright, with flattened plants running through and around themlike the interlocked fingers of two outstretched hands (see figure 4.24[13_chapter04.html#fig4.24]). These plants, normally lying at the edges of tramlines, have had their growth impeded by compacted soil, the result of tractorsmoving up and down the fields during fertilizer application. How the flatteningprocess is capable of discriminating between the maturity of plants is amystery, as is the ability of the Circlemakers to select between plant species,for it is not unusual to find red poppies left standing while flattened barleyflows around the upright flowers.Image [images/p50-01.jpg]Figure 4.25 Undamaged poppy lies upright amid flattened crop. The same effect isalso seen in tall thistles or weeds that grow sporadically in crop fields. AltonPriors, 2000.Image [images/p50-02.jpg]Figure 4.26 Thousands of single stalks left standing amid the flattened crop.East Kennett “cubes,” 2000.This extraordinary selectivity as to what is flattened and what is not extendsto plants of the same type and age, so that odd single stalks are left uprightamid a sea of flattened plants (see figure 4.26 [13_chapter04.html#fig4.26]).This technique proved increasingly useful from 1998 onwards, particularly incrop glyphs involving linear patterns, in which thousands of single uprightstalks were randomly interspersed throughout the floors. By implication, suchselectivity rules out the use of planks or garden rollers. To further complicatethings for hoaxers, after 1999, the Circlemakers sometimes arched the floor layso that the parts of the plants most likely to have been flattened were thosefarthest away from the soil.The seed heads are similarly unaffected by the gentle flattening force andremain attached to the stems. When one is fortunate and stumbles upon a freshformation, it is possible to see how the seed heads are laid down in neatparcels or rows, the heads aligned as if displayed in a museum case.Such features are obviously inconsistent with a “landing,” be it by alien craftor planks of wood. Planked plants are either messily laid down, or, in the caseof immature plants, laid in haphazard ridges that bounce back like shabby tuftsof uncombed, greasy hair. Where force is applied to mature plants, the ripeseeds can be seen all over the circle floor, as the weight causes them to bedislodged from their protective heads.Image [images/p51-01.jpg]Figure 4.27 Precision arrangement of plants.

DAYS OF NO TRUSTOmens of impending catastrophe are rarely recognized until the building startsto shake, so nobody could have anticipated the damage yet to reverberate fromthe Doug and Dave epicenter.Unable to contain the conclusive evidence favoring a genuine phenomenon, thecrudest of political solutions—destruction of personal credibility—was liberallyapplied to the most public figures of crop circle research like modern-dayInquisition. Perhaps more sinister than the public debunking was theinfiltration of research organizations by troublemakers and low-level secretservice operatives, who spread rumors and disinformation in a seeminglydeliberate effort to destroy working relationships. With the core of theiroperations destabilized, several research groups imploded.At one point, two Americans closely connected with members of the CIA (one ofwhom is associated with intelligence gathering on UFOs), bluffed their way intoWingfield's home in Somerset. The plan was for the three to leave together toattend one of Wingfield's lectures. Yet minutes before departure, the two“agents” excused themselves, leaving Wingfield to fulfill his appointment aloneand the pair with a house brimming with unsecured computer files andconfidential papers. A few days later, after his return, Wingfield discoveredsome of their handwritten notes had slipped inadvertently behind the sofa, andthe contents left no doubt as to the pair's involvement inintelligence-gathering activities.Jim Schnabel, who later admitted that he had hoaxed crop circles, demonstratedthe ease with which intelligence eavesdropping had been conducted. At the heightof the Doug and Dave disruption, Schnabel carelessly revealed details made byAndrews of conversations the researcher had made privately on his mobilephone.14 As far as I'm aware, only the military have the capacity and theclearance to tap cellphone communications.Andrews was himself approached to sell his database for a small fortune, inreturn for publicly renouncing his support of the phenomenon, but he refused it,and still does. The CCCS, at the time headed by Ralph Noyes, a formerundersecretary at the Ministry of Defence and member of the Society of PsychicResearch, became riddled with infighting. Deception, suspicion, andstrategically planted lies forced scant resources to be spent rebuttingaccusations. In effect, this was the same divideand-rule approach once employedby despots to control the disparate nationalities of Europe.Image [images/p53-01.jpg]Figure 5.1 Selection of crop circles from 1992–93.To add to the chaos, the media's about-face created an atmosphere of censorshiptowards crop circle proponents, giving saboteurs unlimited access to the publicear, and impunity to carpet-bomb the national and international press witharticles full of fabrications and skepticism. Books and videos of negative biaswere published, influencing even those with a previously sympathetic attitude tobecome turncoats. Serious research was starved of already scarce funds, whilejournalists and publishers turned a blind eye to manuscripts saturated withsolid evidence of a genuine phenomenon. The climate persists to this day.With the Doug and Dave debacle now in full operation, those still devoted to thesubject faced another obstacle: wide-scale hoaxing. A conservative estimatereveals that as many as 90 percent of formations during the 1992–93 period wereseemingly man-made. These years saw pale imitations of existing designs, obscenewords, even a penis, together with squiggles, stick figures, and more added tothe crop circle canvas, much to the fury of farmers—at least the real phenomenoncreated works of art without damaging the plants.Appendages were surreptitiously added to existing designs, fakes laid besidegenuine events, and real formations disheveled and sabotaged, all in acoordinated effort to throw researchers off the scent. Plant biologists wereparticularly hard hit when samples collected from manipulated formationsinevitably revealed conflicting data in laboratory tests. Subdued, distrustful,confused—these words sum up the general mood throughout this period.“If one set out to run a successful campaign to discredit the circlesphenomenon, how would one best proceed?” wrote Wingfield. “Governments at warhave, in the past, counterfeited large quantities of their enemy's currency inorder to devalue and ruin the economy based upon that currency. The samestrategy might be used against the circles by whoever is running anydisinformation campaign” (Wingfield 1992b).The growing number of foreign visitors to the circle sites must also have been aprimary target of the discreditors. From an authoritarian point of view, itwould have made better sense to encourage formations to be faked as precisely aspossible, thereby forcing researchers to commit more time and effort to groundanalysis. Yet with the fields contaminated with blatantly human-made graffiti,crop circle tourists would take home negative impressions of the phenomenon,wondering what the fuss had been about. This is negative advertising at its mosteffective.That the hoaxes were cunningly planned is certain. The more complex fakes weresited away from regular, well-observed haunts, but placed confusingly besideNeolithic sites, just as the real phenomenon would be. The fakes also sharedsimilar signature elements despite being dispersed throughout several southernEnglish counties, suggesting that the same group was at work. A brave colleagueof mine who successfully infiltrated one of these bands of criminals discoveredthey were being paid huge amounts of money to do their dirty work.The high-profile team of Jim Schnabel and Robert Irving was also infiltrated,this time by UFO researcher Armen Victorian, who posed as a business interestduring a phone call to Schnabel. In the taped conversation, later printed inMagazin 2000, the surprisingly candid (and in hindsight, careless) Schnabelrevealed how the authorities were taking measures to discredit thephenomenon—not just the British authorities, but German, American, and theVatican (Hesemann 1993). But Schnabel's most disturbing revelation was that heand his partner were being well supported to “feed information” and “take activemeasures” by a group far above the heads of national governments, by a“supernational organization” (ibid.).15Who or what he was referring to remains to be discovered, but plausiblehypotheses point to the Trilateral Commission.16It is interesting to note that the most concerted efforts at discrediting thecrop circle phenomenon to date have indeed occurred primarily in the UK,Germany, and the U.S., where even today, well-worn Doug and Dave footage isplayed repeatedly on TV.17 A close inspection of their made-for-TV crop circlesis rarely shown because in the end, these forgeries bear as much resemblance tothe real phenomenon as a box of cereal does to Chartres Cathedral. Instead,beautiful aerial footage of the most astonishing genuine crop circles is graftedto their story. “Implication by association” or “seduction by suggestion” areclever marketing techniques, so a shot of Doug and Dave stacking bricks and ashot of the Empire State Building can be edited so as to infer that they couldhave built the skyscraper, too.It may sound ridiculous, but that's exactly the technique by which theridiculous has become the accepted.Doug and Dave's devious practices were enough to plant seeds of doubt andsuspicion in the public's mind, encouraging them to turn away from the subjectsince no rational explanation was presented. So when researchers put forwardtheir case, not only were they confronted by an unsympathetic media, theirresults became harder to accept by a public that had become cautious, skeptical,even condescending, to those still believing the “fairy tale” of nonhuman-madecrop circles.It is human nature to hoax—for profit, out of jealousy, or for attention—and itis shortsighted to suggest that the crop circle phenomenon has escaped its shareof forgeries. The arena of UFO research is similarly rife with manipulatedimagery and bandwagoning, just as the medical industry has its share of quacks,and the auto trade its “tin men.” Records of crop circles now date back severalcenturies, so it is likely that hoaxing only began in earnest following seriousnational attention through the media at the end of the 1980s.By definition, a hoax is a forgery, and forgeries must borrow from existingsources, so it was not uncommon at the time to see elements of designs alreadyestablished as genuine to be influencing the human-made attempts, whichtypically displayed distortions and inaccuracies not found in the originals.However, there was one humorous aspect of the trickery that backfired on thejokers, and it revolved around Busty Taylor. Colleagues at his new job decidedit would be fun to send the well-known crop circles hunter on a wild goose-chaseby giving him exact coordinates of a field containing “a new event.” They knewthat Busty could get a plane up in minutes, so they had conspired to send himflying over a field they had checked earlier in the day and that contained nocrop formations.On his return from this field, Busty was greeted by a giggling crowd and wasasked whether the new formation had merit. “Yes, very impressive, thank you,”replied the experienced pilot, who even secured aerial images of this “new” cropcircle. Perplexed at his finding something where they knew there wasn'tanything, the coworkers meekly owned up to their intended prank.Perhaps in resonance with events or in sympathy for researchers, theCirclemakers seemingly reacted to the mood, slowing down the flow of informationby drastically reducing the number of genuine events. Perhaps by restraining themomentum, they could allow people to compare the real ones with Man's feebleattempts, promoting the phenomenon without doing anything.Despite the situation, a new series of incidences were added to the growing listof “happenings.” Above a field outside the village of Chilbolton, an ultralightaircraft pilot experienced his engine cutting out abruptly, to his horror. Aftera miraculous landing, he had several mechanics look at the troubled motor, butno fault was found. It was in perfect condition. The following day, a secondpilot, strapped into a similar machine, had his engine also cut out over thesame field. Luckily he landed safely, if a little bumpily, in a neighboringbarley field.18It appeared as if the air above this particular plot of land was notengine-friendly.Next morning, the farmer who owned the offending field discovered adouble-ringed circle on the same spot over which both pilots had experienceddifficulties. At first, this was put down to coincidence, but later in the day ahot air balloonist floating nearby reported suddenly being sucked out of thenatural wind current and his craft propelled into a route that led him directlyover the newly formed design. The balloon then grounded into the barley nextdoor.Amid the contrived and primitive patterns, the few genuine examples that didmaterialize were hidden away in unusual locations so that anyone stillinterested in chasing the elusive force in the pursuit of truth was pleasantlyrewarded. The one thing that could be relied on was the inevitable arrival of aseason's “finale”—a design that not only capped the end of a crop circles'season but stood out in contrast and detail, summarizing the year's themes inone masterpiece. The honor for 1992 was bestowed upon a field northwest ofSilbury Hill, through which flows one of Britain's most documented geodeticenergy currents, the “Michael Line” (Broadhurst and Miller 1992, 2000; seechapter 12 [22_chapter12.html#c12] for more information). As with the BarburyCastle “Tetrahedron” and the “Mandelbrot Set” before it, this new pattern wasrich in symbolism.The “Wheel of Dharma” formation—as it became known—looked every bit like a charmbracelet, its 140-foot outer ring anointed with seven logos, each perfectlyaligned to their respective magnetic compass points. At first, it lookedsuspicious, for whoever had laid down this design had apparently not accountedfor a water trough standing uncharacteristically in the middle of the field ofwheat. Now the metallic object cut across the path of the formation's ring,effectively becoming the eighth symbol on the bracelet.Schnabel wasted no time claiming responsibility for the impressive design, tothe degree that he later used a photo of it on the back cover of his cropcircles book—a book essentially lampooning the research community as harmlesscranks and misguided eccentrics.19 But the Wheel of Dharma corresponds to animportant teaching in Buddhism, each symbol on the wheel corresponding to a pathor insight to be mastered by the soul to achieve ultimate spiritual union. Oneof these is the Path of Cleansing, and now in the field it had a physicalmetaphor—a vessel containing water. Incredibly, the morning the Wheel of Dharmacrop glyph appeared, the water level inside the said water trough had droppedover an inch, evidenced by the dark, wet band along the inside perimeter of themetal container.20When prodded about his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, Schnabel intelligentlyreplied that the meaning behind the symbols was “a load of crap.” He apparentlymade them up on the spur of the moment. Schnabel also claimed not to havebothered with a compass, yet each symbol was perfectly aligned to thecorresponding magnetic points; later analysis would reveal how the symbols werealso aligned to the ratio 1:1.618, representing phi or Golden Mean. Schnabel hadsimilarly dispensed with the services of a flashlight since there was enoughlight coming from the moon, he said.Image [images/p57-01.jpg]Figure 5.2 The Buddhist Wheel of Dharma, incorporating a cattle trough exactlywhere the symbol for “cleansing” would have been. Avebury, 1992.But how had he managed to incorporate the water trough so precisely into thealignment of the ring? Apparently he'd stumbled upon it by mistake, the moonhaving suffered a temporary blackout. Further questioning revealed he could notrecall where each symbol belonged in the design. So, as a test of his faith inthe matter, he was challenged to produce a replica of the glyph.21Image [images/p58-01.jpg]Figure 5.3 Schnabel's second attempt at re-creating the Wheel of Dharma.Lambourne, 1992.In remotest Suffolk, away from the scrutiny of the media, the young Americanproceeded to indulge his critics. After hours of toil in unfaltering daylight,his replica of the Wheel of Dharma comprised a mish-mash of poorly executedsymbols, ranging from the international logo for hazardous nuclear waste to agarden roller and a flying saucer (Pringle 1993a). By the time he'd finishedmassacring several hundred square feet of harmless plants it was obvious thatSchnabel didn't lack a fertile imagination. Unfortunately, it applied tofabricating stories, not his practical ability at constructing philosophicalsymbols in wheat. A second attempt in Buckinghamshire, this time for the benefitof Colin Andrews' team, proved even less convincing.If 1992 had been a crop circle year best forgotten in England, the story abroadlooked rosier. Reports of activity throughout Europe began to multiply, with theevents mimicking the same deliberate pattern of design growth already witnessedthroughout England: simple circles, circles with rings, followed by the oddpictogram.Hungary produced so many reports that a map on which they were plotted looked asif it had been blasted with buckshot. Of particular interest was an unusualtriangular design, at which location witnesses had earlier reported a UFO makingstrange designs in cornfields. Hungary at that time was a country unfamiliarwith crop circles, so its example is useful to study. Interestingly, theHungarians believed their crop markings possessed a healing energy, and parentstook sick children into the designs to be cured. This was an aspect of the cropcircles that had already been recorded in England, but the findings had yet tobecome public knowledge (see chapter 12 [22_chapter12.html#c12]).Image [images/p58-02.jpg]Figure 5.4 Encouraged by the media success of Doug and Dave, all kinds ofvandals began to use the countryside as a canvas. Devizes, 1993.Other reports emerged from Ireland, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy,Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, Brazil, and Puerto Rico.Always it was the same story: bent plants, swirled lays, association with sacredsites, lights in the sky, rumbling sounds, and healings. In one case in Russia,a woman held some affected plants in her hands and felt a pressure or tingling,something that she could not replicate with plants gathered elsewhere in thefield.The phenomenon also showed evidence of interaction with substances other thanplants. In the Ukraine, Dr. Vladimir Rubtsov came across a perfect sixty-footring imprinted upon the lightly iced Mzha river, shortly after a UFO was sightedhovering above it.22 Afghanistan reported thirty snow rings “with the detail ofcrop circles,” as observed by an expeditionary group of geologists fromCambridge University in England.In Egypt, a pictogram discovered in the encrusted sand near Port Safaga was allthe more mysterious because of its depiction of a reversed “F”—the symbol of theNeteru, the gods of ancient Egypt who brought universal knowledge to humanityand under whose guidance colossal monuments were erected. This intriguingconnection will have implications later in our study.North America, for all its land mass, had remained relatively unburdened byvisits from the Circlemakers. The United States reported only fifty-five cropcircles up to 1980; Canada fared even poorer with forty-four. But during 1992,no less than thirty-one manifested across the vast, open plains of Alberta andSaskatchewan.Throughout this sparsely populated region, farmers again reported luminousobjects silently buzzing around the night skies prior to the discovery of cropcircles. Surprisingly, the Canadians ruled out trickery as a cause becauseunlike England, Canadian fields were sprayed by airplanes, so the familiar tramlines from tractors were not present—there was no access into the formations forhundreds of yards, and signs of entry were definitely absent in these circles.But just like their British counterparts, the plants in the affected Canadianfields were undamaged, cleanly incised, and precisely swirled. Then, thanks toinvestigative Canadian researcher Chad Deetken, a crop circle in Saskatchewanyielded something unusual.Farmer Rennick of Milestone checked the condition of his crop as a normalroutine. One day, he repeated the exercise only to find a sixty-three-bytwenty-two-foot formation in the middle of the field, with no signs of entry.Rennick had never heard of a crop circle, so at first he assumed the unusualmarkings had been caused by the wind. Intrigued by the anticlockwise swirls, hescrutinized the unbroken plants with growing curiosity, noting that the soiloutside the formation was wet and sticky, yet bone dry and hard as cement withinthe formation's perimeter. Deetken's report described how “the plants in thefield were still green and subtle while in the formation they were dry andbrittle, the seeds shriveled like prunes” (Deetken 1993).Even more interesting was the skid mark made by quills which began at the edgeof the formation and followed the swirl rotation towards the center. At the endof the procession of dark spines lay a previously twelve-inch-tall porcupine,now flattened cartoon-fashion into an “X” barely two inches thick.The flabbergasted farmer examined the condition of the plants inside and outsidethe formation and established that the incident had occurred some five to sixdays prior. Surprisingly, the former twenty-five-pound porcupine showed no signsof decomposition, nor did it emit a rotting odor, and examination of the bodyrevealed no wounds or physical damage by wild animals. Since the remainingquills on its body were also aligned with the direction of flow in the circle,it was clear the unfortunate mammal had been dragged into the center, thenflattened by a tremendous pressure. But what kind of pressure was capable ofdoing this to a twenty-five-pound animal while leaving plants of far greaterfragility unharmed?Reports of animal fatalities in crop circles are rare. In fact, animals wereknown to relocate away from an area about to receive a crop circle. The farmerat Barbury Castle, for example, found his flock of sheep had moved to anotherpart of the area and as far away from the adjacent field and its future cropformation as possible. But as Deetken correctly observed, when threatened withdanger, a porcupine doesn't run away; instead, it holds its ground and curls upinto a protective ball. So, either the creature happened to be in the wrongplace at the wrong time, or had given up its life to provide a major clue to thecircle-making process.Colin Andrews, returning to England for the 1993 season, was quizzed at theairport by his regular taxi driver as to the latest developments in his cropcircle studies. As they drove through the formation-free county of Surrey,Andrews related stories of unusual triangular designs that had recently appearedthroughout a number of European countries. He had barely finished when a newcrop formation in the shape of a triangle came into view beside the busymotorway.Surrey, a county south of London, was apparently deserving of the Circlemakers'attention during that lean year, for it hosted a second pattern comprising acircle-and-ring with an inscribed equilateral triangle. The deceptively simpledesign was one of a number of crop circles under scrutiny by a mathematicianwho, working in Washington, D.C., was discovering that the crop circlescontained previously unknown mathematical theorems (see chapter 10[20_chapter10.html#c10]). The Circlemakers' intellectual profile was rising bythe year.Only a dusting of notable examples of the Circlemakers' art appeared throughout1993, and the overall impression of that year appears symbolic of the contraryforces at work. Most patterns were elegant variations on the now-prevalentdumbbell design, even if the telltale signs of manmade attachments were evident.That the dumbbell was such a dominant feature was perhaps the message itself: inNative American lore, for example, the two circles united by a straight linesymbolize communication between Heaven and Earth, spirit and flesh. So could itbe the Circlemakers were aware of the turmoil and were encouraging us tomaintain the line of communication?The answer may have come in the shape of a pentagonal mandala, the 1993 seasonfinale at Bythorn. Like the Wheel of Dharma the year before, this is aculturally shared symbol of great antiquity, representing for some theintegration of Man with cosmos. It is also a symbol of healing, and whether ornot the Circlemakers were trying to mend the rift created by the crop circledebate, the interesting coincidence remains that the farmer on whose land theformation appeared cared for sick animals. Further, in Eastern traditions, thetenpetaled lotus pattern in the circle design indicates the third chakra, orsubtle energy center, which is associated with the cleansing of emotions. Again,given the current crisis in the world of crop circles, the timing was uncanny.Despite its seemingly positive message, the Bythorn mandala generated so muchacrimonious debate between researchers that to this day even a casual mention ofit ignites passions in those who stood on different sides of the fenceconcerning its authenticity. If there was one example highlighting the degree towhich agents provocateurs had succeeded in destabilizing the objectivity of theresearch community, this was it.Image [images/p61-01.jpg]Figure 5.5 A rare appearance by the Circlemakers in 1993. This mandala wasclaimed to have been man-made, yet the farmer saw it complete nearly eighteenhours before its construction supposedly began. The rough path around theperimeter was made by a visitor. Bythorn, 1993.Proceedings began after local hoaxer Julian Richardson claimed authorship of theBythorn mandala. Richardson asserted that he had constructed the complex designduring the nights of September 4 and 5. Working alone, the nineteen-year-oldsupposedly worked the circular paths from nine at night to two in the morning,returning the following night to add the pentagram. How he held the measuringtape and planked the crop simultaneously is a mystery in itself. Needless tosay, he must have had a superb dentist.Like Doug and Dave, subsequent questioning revealed flaws in the claim.Richardson's sequence of construction was inconsistent with the crop lay, whichrevealed that the pentagram was overlaid by the circular paths, not the otherway around; the blueprint he supposedly used to create the masterpiece wasidentical to one drawn up by CCCS president Michael Green, who later admitted tohave made an error in his hastily prepared plan—an error that had found its wayinto Richardson's drawing. And although the young man claimed to haveconstructed the entire design with one length of rope, careful analysis showedthat two separate lengths with a difference of eight-and-a-half feet betweenthem would have been required.23Most damning of all, the farmer and his two employees clearly remember not onlyseeing the design complete, but seeing it on the morning of September 4, beforethe hoaxer claimed to have employed his rope and tripod (Keen 1994).Despite their damaging presence, with the benefit of hindsight there is no doubtthat hoaxers have provided us a type of litmus test with which to judge theparticulars of the real phenomenon. This is especially so in view of the“counterfeit coins” that would inevitably contaminate the crop circle database,both in number and complexity. However, the bubble of objectivity and claritywithin which researchers in the Meaden, Delgado, and Andrews era had conductedtheir business had burst. Now researchers worked in an arena of conflict,especially among egos. The polarized opinions generated by the Bythorn mandalawas a reminder that no matter what the final answer to the crop circle riddlewould be, it was important to maintain a balanced viewpoint and an open mind.Writing in the Cereologist, Montague Keen pointed this out: “It should serve asa chastening reminder that assumptions about what skillful hoaxers can andcannot do are always dangerous, sometimes arrogant, and occasionally disastrous”(ibid.). Ultimately, the Bythorn mandala seemed to ask for a healing of the riftbetween factions, a cleansing of hearts and minds. As it happens, after 1993,much of the old guard either disbanded or went solo, making room for others toexplore the circles in the fields and discover their secrets.One of these newcomers was myself.14Personal communication from Paul Vigay and Colin Andrews.15Further analysis of Schnabel and Irving's motives are summed up in GeorgeWingfield's article “The Works of the Devil,” 1993.16The Trilateral Commission is a secretive group of elite financiers andpolitical figures. It was formed around 1973 by David Rockefeller.17Other footage shows people caught making a crop circle at night. This footagefeatured paid individuals and was filmed with the knowledge of the farmerinvolved, a point made clear by its originator, John McNish. However, thebroadcast networks consistently hide these facts from their audience, claimingthe footage shows people caught surreptitiously making a crop circle.18Personal communication from pilot Graham King.19One photo shows a diagram of the formation drawn in the dirt on the side of acombine harvester, which Schnabel claims proves his authorship of the pattern.However, a communication by Paul Vigay, who was standing beside the machinealong with a group of other researchers, claims there was no such designpresent, and so the photo must have been shot at another location. A number ofstatements made in the book about certain situations and individuals, andchecked by myself with the individuals in question, have also been shown to befabrications.20Personal communication from author/researcher Mary Bennett.21The geometrical and mathematical aspects of this glyph are dealt with in DavidMyers and David Percy's book Two-Thirds.22Up to a dozen ice rings would later be reported in Canada between the years2000–2001. Ironically, the Discovery Channel ran a cover story featuring Dr.Terence Meaden, who claimed this new phenomenon, too, was the result ofatmospheric vortices. My thanks to Paul Anderson of Canadian Crop CircleResearch Network for the information.23My thanks to computer expert Paul Vigay for this information."},{"pageContent":"6. PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE THATIf you could hear a pin drop in the newspaper world, it would have been amongarticles devoted to crop circles throughout 1994. With the subject now seeminglike a huge prank perpetrated by New-Agers and bored pub chums, the media'ssilence gave the world the impression that the most innovative story exported byBritain since punk music was over. Yet three years after Doug and Dave's“retirement,” the crop circle phenomenon showed no signs of abating.Schnabel himself appeared to succumb to “the work of Satan”—to whom heattributed the origin of crop circles—when he admitted during an interview: “Iactually believe there is a genuine phenomenon that is beneath all the hoaxing.I do not see what the nature of it is. Unfortunately, it's probably too rare forpeople to notice if they just go out in the countryside waiting for something tohappen” (McNish 1991).Yet in 1994, happen it did. A bumper crop of 110 crop circle reports, featuringsixty new designs of a complexity and magnitude that some skeptics found hard toignore: interlocking crescents generating forms resembling spiders, scorpions,and ancient lunar counting systems. At one point, six pictograms were appearingper night, overwhelming research teams which, ironically, due to the calmingeffect of the debunking, were allowed to analyze formations relatively free fromthe interference of armies of curious visitors.The first of two designs that looked remarkably like maps of constellationsdemonstrated new techniques in circlemaking, effortlessly laying down largeexpanses of crop into circular whirls, leaving tiny clumps of rings, dots, andcrescent moons standing amid a flattened sea of wheat. Logarithmically spiralingarms unfurled from points whose tips narrowed like pincers down to one standingplant; the curve on one design even required the plotting of 120 referencepoints when duplicated on paper (see figure 6.3 on page A6 in the colorsection).One person not at all impressed by the use of such complex calculus was thefarmer, who was allegedly seen receiving a large envelope stuffed with moneyjust prior to running his combine through the formation, despite the crop beingtoo immature to harvest. Regardless, the Circlemakers deemed the informationcontained in their original creation important enough to merit a practicallyidentical pattern appearing twentyone days later (see figure 6.6 on page A6 inthe color section).Image [images/p64-01.jpg]Figure 6.1 Selected crop circles from 1994.That the army was still keen in all matters circular was proved when Andrews andeight CPRI assistants parked their van in a lay-by overlooking a formation inthe near-legendary East Field at Alton Priors. The formation resembled a magiceye. The small group was immediately set upon by two military helicopters thatcame charging out of the field below and proceeded to harass them by hoveringmenacingly close to the road. The team climbed back into the van and drove a fewyards farther up the hill for a better view. Perhaps they'd stumbled upon amilitary exercise, although why it was taking place on private farmland wasanybody's guess.One chopper fervently chased them all the way to the top of the hill, narrowlymissing the side of the road and a resident tumulus by a matter of feet. Thesituation was tense. Andrews took defensive measures and drove back down thehill. The military doggedly pursued: at all costs, whatever was in that fieldwas not meant for the public eye.Meanwhile, another group had entered the field on foot from the south and wasmaking its way along the tram lines toward the center of the crop circle. Oneperson could be seen hoisting a fifteenfoot camera pole aloft. Abruptly, one ofthe helicopters broke away from harassing the Andrews team to seek out the newprey, swooping and low-diving at these “intruders” to such a dangerous degreethat the pole had to be lowered to the ground. Apparently, photography was notbeing encouraged either. Unfortunately for the army, one of Andrews' teamvideotaped the incident. It then dawned on the unsettled group what thecommotion was about. According to Colin Andrews:Image [images/p65-01.jpg]Figure 6.2 “Spider” consisting entirely of circles and crescents. BarburyCastle, 1994.Image [images/p65-02.jpg]Figure 6.4 One of three ring-type “Galaxies.” Froxfield, 1994.Image [images/p65-03.jpg]Figure 6.5 The first “Galaxy” formation, destroyed by the farmer immediatelyafter its appearance. Avebury, 1994.The second helicopter flew away across the field, leaving us unattended for thefirst time since we arrived. It moved rapidly across the field, to the south ofthe formation and just north of Woodborough Hill, and stopped as if undercommand to do so. Presently we saw what looked to be a small flashing lightblinking just below and in front of the hovering helicopter. In size andreflective quality it resembled the object seen and filmed by Steve Alexander inan adjacent field back in 1990. As we watched, the helicopter slowly approachedthe pulsating object. When the aircraft reached a point directly in front of it,the object blinked out and re-appeared behind the helicopter. Within moments thehelicopter began to back up until the object was again in front of it, and veryclose. At this point, the object disappeared. The helicopters then rejoined eachother and flew together to the southeast, towards Upavon Military Base, leavingus alone for the duration of our time at the site” (Andrews 1994).One incident of a more benevolent nature occurred at Andrews' office back inConnecticut during a visit from Aztec elder Tlakaelel. Although scheduled toarrive at three in the afternoon, the spiritual statesman arrived at exactly4:15, a time not exactly celebrated around the Andrews home. But then such arethe coincidences of this phenomenon.Tlakaelel was searching Andrews' database for a particular symbol, one he'd beengiven in meditation in connection with “the place of the last ceremonial dance.”As he thumbed through the vast catalog of crop circle diagrams, the humblenative leader pointed to a Celtic cross design, one which Andrews had himselfpremonished back in 1987. But the design was incomplete, and to it, Tlakaelelnow added a tail of seven circles and a crescent moon, a design never seenbefore.As Tlakaelel departed, Colin's fax machine gurgled with news of a new cropcircle just discovered in England, opposite Silbury Hill. It was practicallyidentical to the Aztec man's sketch (ibid.).Image [images/p66-01.jpg]Figure 6.7 “The site of last ceremonial dance.” West Kennett, 1994.According to a later report, the farmer's dog began barking uncontrollably at 4A.M. and continued to do so for the next two hours, presumably during the timewhen the symbol appeared. When the farmer came across the formation afterdaybreak, he saw several luminous spheres gliding along its spine. To add to thebizarre set of events, seeds from the formation were later used for anaturopathic remedy experiment. The patient, while suffering no adverse effectsfrom the remedy, developed a temporary rash on her neck identical to the patternof the unusual crop formation.24Tlakaelel's premonitory crop glyph became the first of three imposing,scorpion-type patterns to appear, the largest more than 600 feet in length anddistractingly visible to drivers on the busy Marlborough-to-Devizes road (seefigure 6.8 on page A5 in the color section). Together with nine other designs,they formed an amalgamation of crescents and circles, symbolizing lunarprinciples; they were also strangely reminiscent of 9,000-year-old pictogramsbased on a lunar counting system found inside a Spanish cave. To prove thepoint, when this calendar was applied to the May 23 “Scorpion,” the formation'sshape accounted for the days from the last lunar eclipse to the date of its ownappearance.25Such details were somehow lost on science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. Therespected literary figure chose to back the anti-cropcircle forum by hiring agroup of five artists to execute a ten-petaled flower below Hakpen Hill for adocumentary debunking the phenomenon (Clarke 1994). To make the small yet prettyflower design took the team two days in bright sunlight, leaving every planton-site crushed, not to mention the dozens of post holes pock-marking the claysoil. The construction time alone set a record as the world's longest-developingcrop circle.None of these crucial points were revealed in the biased program: thirty minutesof scant evidence and opinions from supposed “experts,” few of whom had anyprevious connection with the subject.No comparison was ever made to the genuine article with regard to such anomalousfeatures as alterations to the plant's crystalline structure (as shown inchapter 1 [10_chapter01.html#c1]). Nor was the fact remarked upon that in thisman-made endeavor the comparatively simple pentagonal geometry was inaccurate.These points make one wonder if the Sri Lanka-based Clarke had studied any ofthe growing body of collected evidence at all—even to wonder why, from so faraway, he would bother with a subject that the authorities closer to home werecoping with quite adequately. It was ironic that the author of 2001: A SpaceOdyssey—in which a mysterious black monolith on the Moon leads to the discoveryof a higher intelligence—should choose to discredit a similar phenomenon thatmanifested every summer on his own planet.No doubt Clarke's effort fostered more skepticism. But one person he failed toconvince was the host farmer. The attentive man had experienced the phenomenonin the past, so when he saw the mess left behind by Clarke's team, hissuspicions were aroused. More importantly, he had noticed in the past howanimals—particularly birds—stayed away from crop circles, despite the ease ofaccess to seeds which the downed plants offered. Yet in Clarke's creation, thesite was immediately teeming with wildlife.Needless to say, the farmer was converted into a proponent of the phenomenon.But the real mystery was, who or what had possessed Clarke to undertake such abiased exercise?Meanwhile, other events were taking shape across southern England. A sixfoldflower mandala of superior craftsmanship appeared ten miles away in Froxfield,its 350-foot diameter easily dwarfing the Clarke exercise in scale and geometry.Later, Wiltshire's most complex design to date, resembling a spider's web andembedded with geometric ratios, appeared a stone's throw from the Avebury stonecircle (see figure 6.10 on page A7 in the color section).Image [images/p67-01.jpg]Figure 6.9 The Flower of Life, prime symbol of sacred geometry and ancientEgyptian metaphysics. Froxfield, 1994.Forty miles away, hospital patients gazing from their top floor room at therolling countryside around Cheesefoot Head were treated to the sight of a silverdisk hovering casually in the sky, shortly before a new crop circle appeared. Ared ball of light also ushered in the first wave of Czech crop circles, threematerializing at Klatovy just days after locals witnessed similar strangelights. A dramatic increase of radiation was noticed inside one formation which,as always, appeared in the vicinity of a Neolithic site.26Hoaxers, too, were starting to interact more and more with these flying objects.Having gone home after making a circle, one man returned with friends to showoff his creation only to witness a fresh formation yards away and a luminousorange object flying out of it at high speed. That incident was witnessed by thefarmer.In a separate incident at Clatford, two hoaxers were driving past a crop circlethey had taken no part in making when a bright orange light flew out of it,spooking the youngsters so much that they decided later to contribute to theresearch instead. This second incident was witnessed by several other people.Hoaxer Rob Irving was also in for the surprise of his life: While checking out aformation, he noticed two girls approaching, a silver sphere silently glidingbehind them along the tram lines.27With farmers' attitudes about public access to their fields becoming morestrained by the year (understandably so, due to a frustrating combination ofconstant trespassing and no forthcoming single solution for the enigma), peoplerequesting permission to access the land often found themselves facing a barrageof heated emotions or even a double-barreled shotgun.I bore this in mind as I dedicated more time to research in England during thesummer of 1995, primarily in the application of infrared photography in anattempt to capture that elusive crop circle energy on specialized film. But asthings go in this line of work, I ended up experiencing the energy in anunexpected way.Ringed by a nimiety of prehistoric sites like a jeweled crown, the ancientEnglish capital of Winchester became the center of the Circlemakers' attentionduring this season, giving the Silbury Hill/Avebury area time to absorb theprevious year's bombardment. One bright June morning, Colin Andrews and I metnear this picturesque Hampshire town to begin another arduous day of research.First on our list was a formation barely four hours old at Whitchurch. Myinitial reaction to the forty-foot hooked dumbbell was one of disappointment,and I expressed this sentiment to my colleague. Something about it wasn't rightwith me, least of all because the construction was imprecise. Intuitively thewhole thing felt . . . well, normal. After shooting some frames of film, weheaded north to another fresh formation.Perched on a steep bank beside the bustling A34 at Litchfield, the imposingbull's-eye of seven concentric rings lay within a halo of interlockingsemicircles, creating a pictogram resembling a torc (a Celtic bracelet). As weparked on a country lane four hundred yards from the pictogram, I instantly felta pressure on my chest, as if my lungs had filled with water.Image [images/p69-01.jpg]Figure 6.11 Selected crop circles of 1995.When we got out of the car, the energy charge was instantaneous, practicallypinning me to the door. I remained motionless in contemplation of the pictogramfor a few minutes. “Are you coming in?” Colin shouted, having already negotiatedhis way into the field. The hypnotic hold on me was broken and I followed, stillfeeling the pressure of an unseen hand. I could see that, through his years ofexperience, Colin was familiar with what I was experiencing, so no words ofexplanation were necessary.Scarcely younger than the morning dew, the formation stood out as if it had beenetched by a laser, its plants laid tidily in rows on the ground. These were goodsigns. Around the perimeter, the complex lay was interwoven, the plants abruptlyredirected into semicircles; where these converged, the edges of the formationwall fluted down to a single standing plant with lathe-like precision.Image [images/p70-01.jpg]Figure 6.12 A design immortalized in Celtic jewelry, the “Torc” crop circle waslater discovered to contain a fifth, previously unknown geometric theorem. Inphysics, the torc also represents a combination of forces creating motion, justas in optics it is a rotary effect produced by crystals and liquids on the planeof polarization of light passing through them. Litchfield, 1995.“Not quite the same as the other, is it?” I remarked. Colin later confided thatthe Whitchurch formation had indeed been hoaxed.I reciprocated by sharing with him the infrared photos which showed a markeddifference between the morning's two formations.The Circlemakers resumed their program on the morning of July 12, undetected,amid the picturesque acres of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's country residenceat Kingsclere, now the adopted home of an imposing five-petaled star, despitethe property being manned by a twenty-four-hour security team. With theextensive grounds rigged with sensors, and microphones nestled in the hedges, aresearch team searching for the pictogram was apprehended within minutes oftheir arrival. But nobody had been caught making the pattern.The elusive circlemaking force then delivered a series of designs featuringnested crescents which looked remarkably like astrolabes, the navigationalinstrument used for taking the position of the Sun and stars. These wereaccompanied by five crop formations that took the lion's share of attentionthroughout 1995, designs that suggested some kind of solar system, hinting of anoverall theme based on the mapping of space. The first, consisting of ninetyfivecircles ranging from one to fifteen feet in diameter, showcased the intricacynow involved in the process. As I viewed it from the air in the morning light,the dew-glistened pictogram resembled a central “sun” encircled by two,fist-wide orbit rings, upon which sat two and three “planets,” respectively.Farther out lay a cluster of circles, many lying untouched amid the virgin crop,while the low angle of the sunlight emphasized the tight swirl signatures.According to a meticulous ground survey carried out by my good companionJonathan Wearn, only one of the circles in the group contradicted the entireclockwise rotation.Image [images/p70-02.jpg]Figure 6.13 The precision of the “Torc” is admired by Colin Andrews. Note howthe row of immature wheat along the tram lines has not been affected by thebending process.Image [images/p71-01.jpg]Figure 6.14 Star pentagram, on composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's land. Kingsclere,1995.Image [images/p71-02.jpg]Figure 6.15 One of four “solar system” designs. Note the thinness of the orbitalpaths. Alresford, 1995.What were the Circlemakers pointing to this year? Their home? More pictograms,more teases.Three days later, a second pattern appeared a few miles east on a large tract ofexposed farmland at Longwood Warren, whose owner had shown inhuman patience asthe Circlemakers had made this one of their showcase locations year after year.On this occasion the 240-foot pattern turned out to be a precise replica of ourinner solar system, down to the planetary orbit ratios around the Sun, hereindicated by a majestic sweep of thin, barely eight-inches-wide rings made ofstanding plants. A necklace of grapeshot represented the asteroid belt. Giventhat the precision of information depicted by the construction was accurate to99 percent, whatever had been behind this was indeed proficient at astronomy.Image [images/p71-03.jpg]Figure 6.16 Our inner solar system and asteroid belt, accurate to 99 percent.But why is the Earth missing? Longwood Warren, 1995.Image [images/p72-01.jpg]Figure 6.17 Nested crescents. Such designs are reminiscent of astrolabes.Oliver's Castle, 1995.The Circlemakers were also bent on communicating an important piece ofinformation, since one feature of the design would nag astronomers andscientists for years: why were all the planets accounted for except the Earth,which was missing?Ever since that fateful June morning in 1990, Polly and Tim Carson, the farmersof the East Field at Alton Priors had become accepting of crop circles. In turn,the circles continued to make regular visits to their land like vacationingsummer guests.The Carsons have always been one of the handful of farmers who have consistentlygone beyond the call of duty to help researchers and scientists pin down, evencommunicate with, the forces at work in this enigma. In addition to generouspublic access to their fields, the Carsons took it upon themselves to monitortheir land. At one in the morning of June 17, 1996, one of the farmhandscompleted a thorough scan with an airraid-defying searchlight. Nothing toreport.A similar state of affairs was reached by a group of enthusiasts taking turnssurveying the area throughout the night from the prominent location atop KnapHill, which forms part of the northerly barrier to the East Field. A night ofstrange rumbling sounds ensued, followed at 5:45 A.M. by a new 600-foot longformation. Lying amid the dew-kissed barley, the 94 circles were arranged like aDNA spiral. The accompanying reports proved just as succulent: a middleagedcouple witnessed several luminous spheres hover above the East Field and projectshort beams of light into the ground, after which the UFOs flew northwardstowards Avebury.At this time, a Japanese couple living near the Avebury stone circle weredisturbed by an unusual buzzing outside their home, accompanied by the frenziedbarking of dogs and the bleating of sheep. As the objects shot past Avebury, thebells in the church tower began ringing—in a church that was locked, and whosebells require people to pull the ropes and are not generally rung at midnight.Image [images/p73-01.jpg]Figure 6.18 Selected crop circles of 1996.While this was going on in England, a gathering of native tribes from around theglobe was taking place in South Dakota. The purpose was to share with the worldthe prophesies of the Star Nation people—the off-planet civilizations who areclaimed to be the ancestors and teachers of many of our indigenous cultures. Atthe gathering, Hopi elder Roy Little Sun told of an upcoming solar event and how“the power of the heavens steps down to the Earth. The New Moon is an opening ofa gate of Star Knowledge.”28 This reference was to a planetary alignment on June16, 1996, which would “draw powerful energies to Earth.” Is it possible thoseenergies manifested in the East Field that same night?Image [images/p74-01.jpg]Figure 6.19 DNA spiral or sine wave? Alton Priors, 1996.The number of reported formations by now had reached 8,000 worldwide.29 Althoughthat year saw declining numbers of circles throughout Britain, the trend towardsincreasing design complexity continued, creating an unexpected rise in thenumber of crop circle photographs in the press, even if reporters weren't surewhich side of the fence they were supposed to be sitting on.Historically, a pattern was now developing, with each season contributing whatseemed like a core theme, as if a celestial book was being projected to Earth,chapter by tantalizing chapter. The graphic nature of the new designs combinedwith the field experience of those who took them seriously, meant that progresswas made in extricating all manner of mathematical, geometrical, andphilosophical information and just as in the first stages of the phenomenon, itseemed as if with every breakthrough in research, the Circlemakers upped theante the following year.But the pupils were learning the lesson, so the stage was set for what becamethe “year of the fractals.” I referred to the first of these, the dramatic149-circle “Julia Set,” at the start of this book. To date it remains one of themost elegant examples of the Circlemakers' art; even discounting the logisticsrequired to carry out such an endeavor—reportedly a 15-minute time window—withinsight of one of the busiest monuments in the world, Stonehenge.The “Julia Set” again demonstrated the ability of the crop circles to passivelychange people's perceptions. For example, a hostile farmer named Sandell was seton denying access to the formation, claiming it was all the work of drunkenpranksters, that someone would pay dearly for this atrocity and other pointssupported by not entirely passive hand gestures. He was then calmly shown arecent aerial photo of the design in its majesty, Stonehenge looking on in thebackground. “Bloody hell!” exclaimed the farmer, his heart melting as he studiedthe picture. “People can't make that!” Hastily, his son was dispatched to thesite. The enterprising young man daubed several words across a weathered oldboard and placed it at the entrance to his field: “See Europe's Best CropCircle. £2 Entrance.”Which was not a bad thing. It enabled Sandell to receive compensation for thedamage about to be done to his crop, and thousands of individuals were given theopportunity to experience the phenomenon firsthand, a rare example of mutualbenefit and one worth emulating.Image [images/p75-01.jpg]Figure 6.20 The elegance of this spiral appears totally at ease besideStonehenge, itself encoded with many of the geometric laws of the Universe.1996.Image [images/p75-02.jpg]Figure 6.21 The clear vantage point of the “Julia Set” as had by Stonehengesecurity and hundreds of visitors. Yet nobody saw it appear.In spite of the attendant circumstances behind its appearance, hard-corescientists still contended that the unseen hand behind the “Julia Set” was thatof Man. Yet it took a team of eleven people (including myself) five hours justto survey the formation. Over the course of the hot afternoon, our presenceattracted the curiosity of dozens of motorists as well as a small crowd atStonehenge. How humans making this circle could have avoided detection is beyondme.A molecular biologist who visited the formation out of curiosity experienced asensation similar to intense ultraviolet radiation or gamma radiation exposure,with which he was very familiar. For the rest of the day he experienced nausea,but after sleep he felt an “intense physical well-being and mental clarity”(Pringle 1996).Image [images/p76-01.jpg]Figure 6.22 “Egg of Life.” Littlebury, 1996.Of the other forty British formations for the year, a quarter of them weresuspicious to me. The rest, however, were stellar. Beneath high voltage wires atLittlebury Green, for example, appeared a 400-foot diameter design demonstratingknowledge of the “Egg of Life,” an obscure esoteric symbol whose doubletetrahedral geometry symbolizes the first three mitotic cell divisions of thehuman embryo. Several new formations were also steeped in Buddhist symbolism,such as two representing chakra points, one of which was attached to a snaking,three-quarter-mile-long avenue; another depicted a Mayan Sun glyph.On the slope of Liddington hill fort, a large yin-yang design represented thesolar-lunar rhythm of Universal pulsation, its floor lay resembling flowingwater. Practically every head of wheat was precisely aligned in concordantribbons. A few miles to the north, a perfect vesica piscis figure appeared nearthe Neolithic hill fort at Uffington.Image [images/p76-02.jpg]Figure 6.23 A large vesica piscis, symbolic of the Sun, cradles the four phasesof the Moon, in the rhythm of the Universal cycle. Liddington, 1996.Image [images/p76-03.jpg]Figure 6.24 The principle of alternation, also known as yin/yang in Taoistphilosophy, is expressed by the equal division of the circle (representing God).As such, an equal division retains equilibrium—only through an asymmetricaldivision can natural growth occur in any organism. This asymmetry is expressedin the Liddington crop glyph.In the U.S., a group of native-looking markings appeared in Laguna Canyon nearLos Angeles. The three glyphs appeared on a distinctly unappealing, weed-coveredconstruction embankment adjacent to a toll road. There were two concentric ringformations, and a third of unusual design—two small central rings with fourteenspokes radiating outward in apparently random fashion. Despite the numerousplant species on the steep embankment, only two were affected by bending:English plantain and wild oats.Since this rayed glyph looked remarkably like local native petroglyphs,researchers Ed and Kris Sherwood discovered that the local tribes, the Tongvaand Chumash, both share a similar symbol called the Sun Staff: a steatite stoneincised with the Sun's rays, mounted on a stick and used in solstice ceremonies.After careful measuring, some spokes of the crop circle were found to beoriented to the summer and winter solstices.An ominous message was tied to the event. Tongva tribal stories recount how aspiritual leader, Chingichnish, appeared several hundred years ago to show thepeople how to live in harmony with the Great Spirit. Desecration of the landwould result in three warnings, after which nature would make the peopleaccountable. It was perhaps ironic that there had been much local protest overthis toll road which had destroyed the last remaining wilderness in LagunaCanyon.Was it possible the glyphs had been created as part of the protest? Were thecreators aware of the folklore?At the time of the event, a security guard for the construction company remarkedthat he and his colleagues had seen strange lights and ghosts, frightening oneof them to such a degree that he wouldn't return to work. Samples of the plantsunderwent laboratory analysis, revealing abnormally large cell walls and theindication that the cells had experienced sudden internal heating.30Image [images/p77-01.jpg]Figure 6.25 Laguna Canyon glyph. Southern California, 1996.Back in England, crop circles continued to out-distance all human-madeendeavors, logistically and creatively, and in the caudal days of July they hadone more surprise in store. Following an arduous day of measuring, soilsampling, and plant gathering, my field team colleagues and I retired late tobase camp. The Sun was beginning its inevitable descent below the hills cradlingthe serene Vale of Pewsey. We'd barely sat down to a pint of beer when a pilotapproached us with word of a new crop circle he'd just seen from the air, on theside of ancient Windmill Hill, placing it on the same northerly magnetic bearingas Stonehenge. That should have been a clue as to what was coming.“You remember the ‘Julia Set’?” said the excited young man. How could we forget.“This is three times larger.”We raced up and down one-track country lanes, but with darkness now blanketingthe hill like an ink-black bedspread we returned unfulfilled. An agonizing fivehours of sleep lay ahead.I am genetically indisposed to an earlymorning rising, but on this misty morningI made an exception. Braving the 4:00 A.M. alarm, we drove the ten miles back toWindmill Hill, thinking if this was as important a sighting as we had been ledto believe, we needed physical proof of it before the world descended on it. Weknew that only two nights before, a group of people had witnessed a display ofunusual aerial maneuvers by intensely bright objects over the same area.The persistent mist held the Sun in check, giving the English countryside thatair of perpetual mystery. This formation was not keen to give away its positioneasily, yet we could sense its presence. We walked past one of the many barrowson this special hill and along a curving field, the bulk of which lay out ofview. All of a sudden we came upon a sight that rendered all vocabularyobsolete. Splayed out before us, the wheat was pockmarked with circles as far asthe eye could see, the shape hard to fathom at first due to the relatively flatground. We would have to walk the logarithmic curves to make sense of the floorplan: a battery of circles, anchored in three lazy arms flowing to a centrallocation, resembling the vortex created by water in a draining bath. It lookedlike a triple “Julia Set” fractal.Image [images/p78-01.jpg]Figure 6.26 “Triple Julia Set.” Windmill Hill, 1996.The real challenge was how best to walk upon it. The tightness of the swirls,the pristine lay, not to mention the differences in design applied to eachindividual circle floor—laying a foot on this work of art would virtually amountto sacrilege, like painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling on the floor and thenallowing foot traffic.Our need to examine it was overwhelming, and yet our desire to leave ituntouched was nearly as strong, so we compromised by removing our mud-cakedboots. Remaining objective at moments like this is a challenge in itself. Westepped forward daintily, feeling the sensation of the air being squeezed outbetween the laid plants and the ground. No damage was evident. Plants were bentat their bases, but they barely touched the soil and showed no signs of mud orfootprints; the soil inside the formation was drier to the touch than that inthe surrounding field. Meanwhile, the needle of my compass behaved like a drunkwalking the line, indicating a disrupted magnetic field.Each of the 196 circles in this design was separated by a veil of one to twostanding stalks. The formidable central circle was punctuated at the center by athin circular clump of standing plants eight inches in diameter, with noindication of an incriminating human-deployed tripod or post. The entireformation measured 1000 feet, point to point.After a moment to check on reality, I began to study the minutia of theformation. The construction detail at the center of each circle was different: acircular standing clump in one gave way to a nest of plants in another; one hadhad so much torque applied that the plants twisted around each other forming athick wreath, while the next had the plants bent six inches above the ground,whereupon they fell outward forming a structure resembling a miniature Africancane hut. It was as if the Circlemakers had incorporated every facet of theircraft into one design for the benefit of anyone who'd spent the past twentyyears stranded on a desert island.Confronted with such details, the “hand of Man” theory was faced with logisticalproblems. If a group of people had made this, they certainly weren't going tostick around and individually craft 196 circles; they'd be wanting to leave assoon as the first rays of light appeared, and avoid getting caught.All of this posed some interesting logistics. We'd left the area around eleventhat night. At that time of the year, depending on the weather, darknesssuccumbs to light between three and four in the morning. That leaves five hoursof night, maximum; then the farmers make their rounds and the hoaxers' game isup. That would allow 1.53 minutes to lay down each circle, let alone to stakeout the computer-precise spirals with circles of varying degrees of diameter.It's too bad the Bratton hoax media people hadn't been at Windmill Hill thatmorning and showcased this beauty on breakfast television.It seemed as if 1996 would finish on a positive note. On the afternoon of August10, a few days prior to wrapping up the season's research, I sat down for aquiet tea in Avebury. I was approached by a man, a stranger to me, who claimedto have met me at the Barge Inn the previous evening—an odd remark since I hadnot been there last night.I humored him, and he introduced himself as John Weyleigh.“Have you come for tea?” I inquired.“No, just wanted to say hello,” he said.Apparently he planned to do a night watch that evening to capture somethingrelated to crop circles on video. He wanted my advice on places where he couldmost likely see some action, a strange request so late in the season. But Ireasoned to myself that he was probably only recently interested in thephenomenon, so I pointed him in the right direction. Besides, he appeared keento stick it out all night, which not many are thrilled to do, given the damp,cold British nights.“Adams Grave, Milk Hill, or West Kennett Long Barrow—they afford excellentviews,” I said, flattered that despite my low-key presence in circles researchhe should have come to seek my advice. Weyleigh asked where I could be reached,so I recommended the Barge Inn as a reliable message center. The young, timidlad then left me to molest my scones. Through my grandmother I inherited thepriceless gift of intuition, and there was something about this apparentlybenign encounter that smelled closer to week-old halibut than fresh cream tea. Iwould not have long to wait before my gut feeling was confirmed.The following evening around ten, I arrived at the Barge Inn with CPRI's U.S.coordinator Jane Ross, to see if any new information had been posted. I enteredthe near-deserted pub and was immediately pounced on by a very excited manpresenting himself as Lee Winterston: “Are you Freddy Silva?”Image [images/p80-01.jpg]Figure 6.27 The notorious hoax below Oliver's Castle. 1996.I was startled by the approach. I'd never met Lee—a filmmaker and cameraman—yethe scrambled off his chair to meet me like a longlost cousin.He claimed that a man named John had been calling for me since lunch time, andLee had spoken to him on my behalf. John claimed to have captured an importantevent on video and wanted to show it to me. Lee had John's home and mobile phonenumbers, and seemed anxious for me to make contact. Why someone would interceptcalls in a pub for a person they'd never met seems strange to me, as the normalprocedure is that the barman takes incoming messages.The whole thing appeared orchestrated. Regardless, I rang John, who soundednervous for someone who had just “captured an important event” on tape; I forone would be filled with uncontrollable excitement, to the point of callingpeople I hadn't spoken to since high school. I suggested he come overimmediately before the pub closed.We sat and waited. Ultralight pilot Mike Hubbard and editor Nick Nicholsonjoined us for a drink. Conversation hovered around a new crop circle at Oliver'sCastle which had been found that morning; Mike had flown over it but didn't seemconvinced that the crop circle was genuine.About twenty minutes later Weyleigh arrived, apprehensive and nervous, but withvideo and roommate. Apparently he'd been camping all night at Oliver's Castleand in the early morning hours, wakened by a sound, he grabbed his camera andbegan filming.The footage was incredible. About fifteen seconds long, it showed the panoramicview of a fully formed crop circle, obviously shot from the top of Oliver'sCastle. In Jane Ross's words: “Suddenly two pairs of luminous balls of lightappeared from the bottom right hand corner of the frame. The first set movedclockwise over the formation, the second set seemed to hover erratically asthough inspecting or reconnoitering the circle. At the end of the segment afifth ball of light shot rapidly through the center of the frame between the twopairs of light balls, from the lower left hand corner to the upper right handcorner of the frame and out of the picture. The final segment contained anoverview of the formation from a slightly different perspective.”Image [images/p81-01.jpg]Figure 6.28 Taken within twenty-four hours, the mess of construction inside theOliver's Castle formation reveals the hand of man.Nick and I took turns looking through the viewfinder. We concurred. Five ballsof light, of the type similar to those witnessed by hundreds of people, checkingout a crop circle like sniffer dogs—all captured on video. Weyleigh wasreluctant to play and rewind the supposed original copy over and over for fearof damaging it. Nevertheless, if this turned out to be a genuine piece offootage, it could rekindle the public's passion for the phenomenon. But afterthe initial excitement the little voice inside me screamed, “remain objective.”Rather than rushing to negotiate media rights on the spot, I left a message withColin Andrews to look at the evidence and see where it needed to go from here.If legitimate, the news would sound twice as convincing coming from someone withhis high profile in the subject.But when Andrews saw Weyleigh two days later the story had changed. Weyleighsaid he'd been trying to reach Andrews from day one. During a second meeting onAugust 17, an even more jittery Weyleigh told a different version of the story.According to Andrews' report: “He said that he went to Oliver's Castle becauseFreddy had told him that people would be doing a watch there that evening.” (Ihadn't, since the location was not a routine lookout position for me.) “At fivein the morning he was awakened by a buzzing sound and saw a ball of light in thefield. His camera wouldn't operate at first, due to moisture, but then did. Hetrained it on the field where he had seen the single ball of light and wasrewarded with its return. He watched through the lens as four balls of lightcreated a crop circle.”When Andrews mentioned this three months later in Connecticut, the pennydropped. Jane Ross and I looked blankly at each other: “What crop circleforming?” At no time did we ever see a crop circle in the act of forming, withor without the aid of balls of light, a fact later corroborated independently byNicholson and Hubbard (without me prompting them).There were two versions of the same video!Nobody had taken the initial bait, so the footage must have been manipulated tomake it too sensational for anybody else to refuse it.The deception continued. When Andrews requested the footage for professionalanalysis, Weyleigh made himself hard to contact. Messages went unanswered, andeventually a phone contact suggested he did not live at the address given. Whatwas going on here? A money-making scam? A new attempt at entrapment?Several weeks went by. Weyleigh contacted other researchers, telling them howunsure he was of Andrews' motives, and disappointed that he hadn't called. Thetruth was, that without the original tape, video analysis would be inconclusive,and since the original was supposedly shot on the inferior commercial VHS tapewidth (using a camcorder), analysis would prove difficult anyway.Despite serious doubts over the motives of this cameraman, what later becameknown as the infamous “Balls of Light” video (with the crop circle forming)entered the lecture circuit full-time, much to the delight (and profit) of anumber of not-necessarily “objective” individuals. Their response to theevidence (which was generally swept under the carpet) was that Ross, Nicholson,Hubbard, and I had missed seeing the crop circle forming on-screen—a lameexcuse, given the unanimous recall from these witnesses and my fourteen yearsexperience spent in editing studios looking at details on small televisionscreens.One thing was guaranteed to attest to the truth, and that was the physicalevidence at Oliver's Castle. So the morning after the initial meeting withWeyleigh I'd taken the precaution of visiting the site.Arriving at the hilltop at six in the morning, I found the area shrouded inthick mist, and I feared that even from the steep 250-foot vantage point theexercise might prove fruitless. Then, as if by chance, a puff of wind brushedaside the milky white curtain, and for fifteen minutes I had a clear view of thesubject later to cause so much concern. I shot some infrared film, then observedhow the simple six-spoked snowflake looked crooked and a little rough, even at adistance.I returned to the scene later with Jane Ross. The disappointment was immediate:where were the swirls, the unbroken plants, the fluid lay? The whole thing was amess, irregular in flow and trampled in haphazard directions; the edges wereill-defined and most of the avenues were crudely misaligned. No electromagneticanomalies were found. In fact, we had seen genuine formations in better shapeafter three weeks of trampling, yet this one was barely twenty-four hours old.The ground evidence alone discredited the video. Yet like its predecessors (theDoug and Dave footage and McNish's night-time “exposé”) it still ended up beingparaded around the media and Internet, this time, ironically as proof thataliens are the ones doing strange things to crops. And while a few researcherscontinue to milk the situation in light of the evidence, my respect goes tothose principled enough not to buy into any more deception, no matter how closeto reality the “Balls of Light” video may turn out to be.A private investigation paid for by Colin Andrews eventually traced Weyleigh toa film editing facility in Bristol, England. Weyleigh—real name Wabe—was agraphic designer and co-partner of the facility, which supplies video postservices and animation to professional media productions. Wabe's businesspartner admitted John's involvement and said that he had urged him to comeclean. Three years later, Weyleigh admitted his involvement, even producingfootage showing him receiving my initial phone call from The Barge Inn.3124Personal communication from Jane Ross.25Personal communication from astronomer and mathematician Gerald Hawkins, andbased on research from his book Beyond Stonehenge.26Personal communication from Colin Andrews.27CPRI database, Colin Andrews.28UFO Reality, Issue 5, Los Angeles, December 1996.29CPRI database.30This footnote has been intentionally omitted for this edition.31From personal conversations with Colin Andrews.

ALL COME TOGETHERSeventeen years after Pat Delgado found himself at the entrance of a simplecircle of plants graciously collapsed at his feet, crop circles had developedinto a kind of real-life science fiction. Yet according to orthodox science thatwas precisely the category into which the whole phenomenon should be relegated.As far as science was concerned, the subject was nothing more than therecreational delusion of kooks, New-Age dropouts, and government conspiracytheorists.At the start of the 1997 season, one only had to stand on the slopes of BarburyCastle and wonder what it would take for the phenomenon to be given greateracceptance at academic levels. Or would crop circle events overwhelm theirpresent belief system? One thing was certain: Whoever created the six-petaledseason-opener in the rape field below knew their trigonometry well, since itincorporated Ptolemy's theorem of chords, not exactly standard curricular farein mathematics classrooms today.This auspicious start signaled the beginning of a year seemingly dominated bysymbols from esoteric philosophy and sacred geometry. Several crop formationsdemonstrated knowledge of the Qabbalah.32 The first, a 150-foot long renditionof the Tree of Life, was greeted with divided opinions, due in part to theoverall mechanical appearance and the generous use of tram lines, along whichthe straight edges of the design had been conveniently constructed.Whether in reply to or in synchronicity with this unmistakable Qabbalisticsymbol, a gigantic snowflake design appeared in the field previously occupied bythe “Julia Set,” this time witnessed by no one. But the more I looked at thedesign, the less resemblance it bore to an ice crystal and the more it revealeda coded reference, since each branch of this “snowflake” gave the impression ofa tree bearing thirty-two spheres, as in the Thirty-Two Paths of Wisdomcontained in the Tree of Life diagram (figure 7.3 [16_chapter07.html#fig7.3]).Just as ancient doctrines made a practice of shrouding esoteric information insymbols, so it also seemed that the Circlemakers had encoded higher wisdom inliving grain.Image [images/p85-01.jpg]Figure 7.1 Selected crop circles of 1997.A mystery of another kind was why did the attendant farmer develop a surprisingchange of heart this year by denying public access to the crop circle? Thenormally forthcoming Stonehenge guards were similarly reticent with information,reluctant and uneasy in discussing the issue any further. Had a careful word ortwo been planted in their ears?A third Qabbalistic symbol sprouted in Alton Priors, a formation consisting ofan outward rotation of twelve equal circles sharing a common circumference—atwo-dimensional representation of the tube torus, a diagram of the spiraling,regenerative force underlying all life. A number of people (including myself)initially walked this formation in a clockwise motion, contrary to the lay; inhindsight, this was much like rubbing the cat's fur the wrong way. Consequently,we were met with nausea and disorientation at the other end. Four women who alsowalked against the natural flow on separate occasions all reported abruptactivation of their menstrual cycles even though none were due for another twoweeks. It later transpired that the natural vortex action of the torus isanticlockwise, so we repeated the exercise, this time with marked vigor as wefollowed the correct energetic rotation of the pattern.Image [images/p86-01.jpg]Figure 7.2 “Six Moons.” Barbury Castle, 1997.Image [images/p86-02.jpg]Figure 7.3 Stylized “Tree of Life” crop glyph, and one of its six“fruit-bearing” branches. Stonehenge, 1997.Another characteristic synonymous with the torus is the balance of energyreportedly found in the center, the regenerative power of creation in perfectequilibrium. To demonstrate the existence of this still-point of energy, anumber of dowsers located the energy center of the crop circle approximatelytwenty-eight feet northeast of the physical center. During the exercise, allrotating pendulums became listless within five seconds, as if their naturalmovement had been forcibly sucked downward by some underlying magnetic force. Asit happens, the formation had been perfectly placed along an active line ofelectromagnetic energy running through the nearby long barrow of Adam's Graveand the adjoining East Field.33Like the torus, fractals are a way of visualizing the creative process, and likethe Julia Set, the Koch fractal is a computer-generated geometric figure.Developed by Helge von Koch in 1904 as a mathematical study of coastlines (toshow where geometric order breaks into chaos), it became the prototype of anextensive family of fractals based on the repetition of a simple geometrictransformation. For example, take an equilateral triangle with sides of length1, to which is added a new triangle one third the size at the middle of eachside, then repeat the process into infinity. No matter how many times it ismagnified, the original pattern remains evident.Today, this technique is applied to the calculation of uncertain economicprinciples such as the rise and fall of stock markets, but on the afternoon ofJuly 23, 1997, it was applied to a field beside Silbury Hill.At two in the afternoon, a group of German visitors reached the summit of theprehistoric mound, and peered around at the patches of light and shadow cast bythe broken cloud over the surrounding fields like sunlight through lace. Apartfrom the commanding view nothing appeared out of the ordinary. Two hours laterthe Koch fractal appeared, crowned with a perimeter of 126 circles and threeoutlying grapeshot, all within supervisory gaze of the truncated cone ofSilbury.Once again it was from the air that the visual beauty of the plant lay couldbest be appreciated. The 250-foot design grew out of a tightly-spun thirty-footcircular vortex, abruptly conforming to its hexagonal aspect, splitting furtherout into eighteen smaller half-hexagons and creating the three-pointed stars oneach well-defined tip. On the ground, the degree of execution had been sodelicate that palm-height poppies remained upright and intact with strands ofwheat combed around them.Image [images/p87-01.jpg]Figure 7.4 The twelve rings of the tube torus, quickly overrun by hundreds ofadmirers. Alton Priors, 1997.Like the “Julia Set” before it, the “Koch Fractal” provided one more piece ofevidence created under daytime conditions. Esoterically, it was also furtherproof to some that the hand of Divinity lay behind the crop circles, given howthe symbol represented the Seal of Solomon.34 To dowsers, in particular, ithighlighted the part the Earth's geodetic energy lines played in the phenomenon,as once again a major crop circle had appeared upon the unseen Michael Line.One week after the breathtaking event at Silbury Hill, this case was reinforcedseven miles away on the prominent chalk escarpment of Etchilhampton, where notone, but two crop formations garnished its mile-long wheat field. A geodeticenergy line runs through this site, its course meandering through the Vale ofPewsey down to Stonehenge, and marked with tumuli and long barrows left by ourdistant ancestors, in this case, as a mirror-image of the constellation Draco.Etchilhampton's two crop formations were poles apart in design. The first was acircle containing a square, gridded with twenty-eight by twenty-five narrow,ruler-straight channels, as if a cosmic surveyor had been out measuring histerritory. Some 150 feet away, and in stark contrast to this rigid structure,stood the second formation: a fluid six-petaled flower radiating with Atlanteanmystery, the semi-circular lay from its petals creating a spinning motion fromthe air.Image [images/p88-01.jpg]Figure 7.5 The “Flower” and “Grid Square” appeared on the same night.Etchilhampton, 1997.Both formations were contained within the energy line, and a measurement alongtheir axes also revealed a perfect alignment to magnetic north. What's more,both designs could be overlaid on each other to within an inch of tolerance. Whocould achieve such precise measurements? Amid the “Grid Square,” the airperfectly still, I could hear a crackling noise coming from everywhere yetnowhere, stopping as I stepped beyond the perimeter of the circle.The undeniable link between crop circles and energy lines came in oneChaplinesque episode, as our carload of people made its way up the road belowAdam's Grave. Quite abruptly, all members of our party felt a heavy tension atthe base of their skulls, which precipitated an unrehearsed “aargh” fromeveryone aboard; this was followed by intense chest pressure—we'd just crossedover a geodetic line connecting the Adam's Grave long barrow with various nearbyNeolithic mounds, as well as the now-disheveled tube torus formation across thevalley.It felt as if something were brewing, like an electrical charge wound into anover-tightened coil. Was it possible we were sensing another crop circleforming, the pattern already programmed into the ground? We arranged a nightwatch atop nearby Knap Hill, but nothing materialized except the aroma of verydamp clothing. The following morning, Jane Ross and I drove across to theopposite side of the valley. Passing through the village of Allington, weexperienced the same bodily pressure. When we returned across the same spot inthe afternoon, the pressure was still there. We had indeed crossed a secondgeodetic line from Adam's Grave, this time one that ran along the base of MilkHill.We were curious as to what was going to manifest in that location. Never had weexperienced such strong energy and discomfort. Before the week was over, ourcuriosity was satisfied. At six in the morning on August 18, farmer Riley wasout checking the condition of his ripe wheat below Milk Hill and discovered asecond “Koch fractal” embedded in it, much like its predecessor, except it worea reverse standing pattern in the center; clinging to its perimeter were arecord 204 circles, all in various sizes and each with a thin central clump (seefigure 7.6 on page A7 in the color section). The entire formation stood upon thegeodetic energy line.With a construction rate of 1.17 minutes per circle, the logistics were verymuch against the “hand of man.” Besides, the location had been watched for mostof the night and nobody had reported intruders; further, the heavy clay soil waswet and clinging from days of intermittent showers, yet no trace of mud waspresent upon the horizontal plants, beneath which easily crushed balls of chalkappeared intact.Image [images/p89-01.jpg]Figure 7.7 The geometric grid that would have been required to make the MilkHill “Koch fractal.”When I later sat down to analyze the geometry behind the Milk Hill “Kochfractal,” I noticed the construction matrix was based on a triangular diagram ofprofound mysticism containing the Ten Words of God, also known as thePythagorean Tetractys (see chapter 9 [19_chapter09.html#c9]). The crop glyphrequired connecting the ten reference points as a foundation grid, from whichsprang the hexagonal framework; then it was a matter of bisecting each angle ofthe hexagon so that a lattice grid system could reference the various elementsof the pattern. This was just for the outer part of the design.To create the central “island,” an inverse bisection was required, by whichtime—had the formation been man-made—the whole field would have resembled askating rink after three periods of geometric ice hockey. To cap it all off, thehalo of circles had to be dropped-in, referenced to each grid line and itscorresponding space; finally, the complicated grid required a central referencepoint, yet the center clearly lay twelve feet into undisturbed crop. Perhaps ahoaxers' tripod had levitated.I wasn't the only one overwhelmed with the mathematical scope of this art. Aworld away in Arizona, Rod Bearcloud Berry asked two engineering firms to bidfor the job of staking out the 346 reference points that would have beenrequired prior to flattening the wheat: each estimated six-and-a-half toseven-and-a-half days of work. Yet this crop formation had definitely appearedovernight. The statistics were no kinder for a survey conducted under cover ofdarkness: that would take eleven days. And there was no way around it, statedthe engineers, surveying was the only way this design would ever have been madeby humans, and the lucky party would have been billed up to $5340 just for thepreliminaries (Berry 1998).Barely a week following the formation's appearance, Rob Irving was hired tocreate a crop circle beside the “Koch fractal.” Academics were summoned, alongwith a sprinkling of researchers for the now-standard showdown, this time forthe benefit of Sky Television. After trampling a thirty-foot diameter circlewith a garden roller, Irving was out of breath and had to take a break beforeattempting four smaller, irregular circles. Despite the obvious physical andvisual discrepancies, a greater effort was spent by the gathered press examiningthe pale human attempt than its superhuman counterpart. Like all other wondersthat fail the test of rationality, the Circlemakers' crop glyph was brushedunder the carpet of metaphysics—that comfortable repository under which theunorthodox is hidden from public view by conformists and maintainers of thestatus quo.However, it seems the Circlemakers had the last word. As the satisfied TV crewfinished filming the hoax, they regrouped at the fractal and arranged to filmthe farmer driving his combine defiantly through its maze of circles andhexagonal rays. The expensive farm machine, according to its proud owner, hadhitherto performed with monotonous reliability. It broke down the moment theformation's perimeter was broken. This TV segment was never broadcast.“We were asked to design a complex crop formation that could be made at night inunder four hours. The formation we designed had over 100 flattened circles and adiameter of 300 feet, putting it on a par with some of the most complexformations to appear in the fields of England over the past few years.” So readthe statement from Team Satan,35 a group of three hoaxers who also paraded underthe moniker “circlemakers,” a name seemingly hand-picked to generate maximumconfusion. From now on I shall refer to this group as Team Satan/circlemakers;this will avoid confusion and minimize any comparison with the creators ofgenuine crop circles, the Circlemakers.Already well-known as an active hoaxing group throughout the Wessex area since1994, the three earned a reputation among cereologists for claiming some of themost complex circles. According to the images posted on their website, one wouldthink they created the “Solar System” glyph, the “Triple Julia Set,” the “Kochfractal,” and according to Irving, the original “Julia Set” which, of course,they would have had to make in broad daylight beside Stonehenge while invisible.But then again it's far more convenient to claim a bank robbery than do the deedyourself, just as it is common practice for multiple terrorist organizations toclaim responsibility for the same bomb.In 1998 though, they found themselves in the enviable position of being flownhalfway across the world to New Zealand, to create a crop circle for the benefitof a TV documentary to be shown in the U.S. One presumes Team Satan was wellcompensated for its time and effort; the farmer alone was paid three times themarket rate for his soon-to-be demolished crop.When images of their handiwork began to surface, it looked as if the crop circlephenomenon was again on the verge of being explained away to the public. Thegrouping of circles constructed to mimic the “Triple Julia Set” was impressiveat first glance, even if a third of the size of the original; it was farmessier, and given its basic triangular geometry, skewed and misaligned. At itscenter lay a circle with a cleft chopped out of the top, a naïve representationof a Mandelbrot Set. But to the team's credit it was a formidable achievement,even if they failed the time limit (it actually took them longer than fivehours).However, accounts by the farmer and a New Zealand newspaper suggested theendeavor was not as innocent as it first appeared: The production crew hademployed the services of two forty-ton cranes. Why these should have been usedin circle-making was anybody's guess, particularly as equipment of this bulkwould have to have been air-lifted into this inaccessible part of the SouthIsland, where even the sheep outnumber the people. The answer came when thedocumentary premiered in America on NBC in May 1998.With a running time of one hour, Unmasked: The Secrets of Deception devoted justfifteen minutes to the team's endeavor. To establish its credibility as a“serious documentary,” the program began with footage from casinos, in whichhidden cameras filmed gamblers in the act of cheating. The second segmentattempted to demystify séances by demonstrating how, with the aid of hiddenwires, candelabras and other objects are made to fly around the room in thedark. This was followed by an exposé discrediting mind readers, who stoodaccused of deceiving their clients by using black coffee as a mirror in whichthey saw designs their clients drew on cards; a stab at psychic surgerypractitioners in the Philippines rounded off this seemingly harmlessinvestigation of the mysterious at work.Image [images/p92-01.jpg]Figure 7.8 Made-for-TV. Elaborate but rough hoax created under artificiallighting by Team Satan/circlemakers. The whole design fails to hit much of thetriangular/hexagonal geometry. Dunearn, New Zealand, 1998.I say harmless because at first glance all of this seems credible. Gamblingcheats caught on hidden camera—what could be more convincing? But flyingcandelabras and other such parlor trickery were last used during the Victorianera, and coffee and mind readers don't go together, since coffee is a stimulantand hardly useful for inducing psychic activity, which requires the mind to berelaxed.Clearly, the program was designed to gain the viewer's initial trust, afterwhich it could set up all manner of subjects as frauds simply by association.Thus the stage was finally set for the sharp-dressed presenter to announce “thebiggest scam of all—crop circles.” After a brief overview and pretty aerialfootage, here are some of the claims the writers made, followed by myclarifications: “Researchers say there's no physical evidence of humanconstruction . . . that there's no disturbance of soil, nor footprints.”Actually, researchers say that traces of human involvement, in the shape offootprints, disturbed soil, and damaged plants are signs of foul play.“Often the ground is hard [inside crop circles].” No, often the ground is muddyin the British Isles. Perhaps the writers had forgotten that it has been known,on occasion, for rain to fall there. In fact, 60 percent of crop circles appearon rainy nights.Then we are told that the hoaxers “weren't interested in sacred geometry.” Thatwas hardly surprising, for despite its carefully designed blueprint, the NewZealand formation was not laid to accurate geometric principles. Such astatement is also an admission of ineptitude, since sacred geometry and obscuremathematical theorems had by now been proven to exist in genuine formations, andfixed mathematical values simply cannot be arrived at by chance (as we'll see inchapter 9 [19_chapter09.html#c9]).“No one has ever been caught—until now!” and “made by unknown visitors.” Surelyif they were caught they must be known? The truth is, the whole production wascarefully planned onsite over the course of three days, with townspeople turningup to watch as the crew went to work. Even the farmer showed up.“Another discovery is made as the Sun rises over the crop,” the narratorcontinues, implying that the film crew stumbled upon the hoaxers by accident, inmuch the same way that Napoleon found himself one morning to be the ruler ofEurope by mistake. Joking aside, when the presenter insinuated that theoperation had been conducted with the mere help of the moonlight, the pennydropped on those two cranes.Apparently the New Zealand night turned out to be much darker than its Englishcounterpart, so much so that two powerful lights needed to be suspended over thefield to allow the field forgers to do their business. One could argue thatvideo cameras require light to record detail, in which case why was the entiresequence not shot through night-vision equipment? Alternatively they could havewaited for that cheaper alternative, the Sun. In any case, neither the crane northe artificial lighting were seen on air.The program went on to state how “communication in the dark field was made by aseries of silent signals and by holding planks of wood in the air.” This may beindisputable, given that even a raised index finger can be seen on the otherside of a field when bathed in the glow of ten thousand watts of light. But tryit in the dark, when anything twenty feet in front of you has as muchluminescence as a lump of coal, and see if you can create a near-perfectgeometrical shape, coordinated with your partner standing 300 feet away. Ofcourse, one could paint the planks white, but then why would hoaxers need towear black camouflage? The height of the plank would also have to beextraordinary, given that some formations in England are found on curved slopeswith gradients of more than thirty feet. This means that extraordinary bicepsmust be standard equipment for hoaxers, too.Minute by agonizing minute, an elaborate con was perpetrated on an unsuspectingAmerican public, killing the subject of crop circles for good in their heartsand minds by discrediting the phenomenon and its believers through associationwith seemingly fraudulent subject matter. The episode was laughable if one knewboth sides of the story, but sadly, that excluded the majority of the TV-viewingworld. Without showing as much as a lintball of research or comparativeanalysis, nor any counterpoint by anyone from the opposite camp of opinion aboutthe phenomenon, this sixty minutes of televised mischief no doubt succeeded inalienating another segment of potential supporters.Perched on the other side of the globe, sparsely populated New Zealand wascarefully chosen as the venue so as to prevent experienced, pro-crop circleresearchers from attending. As an extra precaution, the formation was harvestedthe moment filming stopped. Yet not all such tracks were covered, for it waslater revealed to me that the entire design had been marked out with stakes andstring prior to filming—small wonder the three Team Satanists are seen creatinga coherent geometric pattern so effortlessly on time-lapse film. They couldn'thave gotten away with this back in Wessex. The farmer himself saw the productionteam filming the set up as he inspected the field out of concern for damage toareas of crop that had not been paid for.36Naturally, such incriminating evidence was never disclosed on air.To be fair, I was asked by a member of Team Satan/circlemakers to contribute anyquestions which could be used in discussion on the program, and I did. Not onemade it on air. However, one truthful statement by the producers of thismasterpiece of deception was said right at the beginning: “Crop circles are oneof the most misunderstood phenomena.” With programs like this, it's no wonder.Image [images/p94-01.jpg]Figure 7.9 Selected crop circles of 1998.Thus began the 1998 crop circle season.Meanwhile back in England, a pilot taking off from the airstrip near Weyhill onApril 19 stumbled upon the first formation, a low-key circle overlapped by acircle-and-ring. Having figured out the genuine Circlemakers' capacity to encodethe season's geometric message into the first salvo of designs, I labored overthe formation's blueprint and uncovered a pentagonal code that would appear incrop circles throughout the season. But that spring my intuition told me theyear would be dominated by sevenfold geometry for the first time. On a hunch Iapplied a heptagonal (seven-sided) framework over the Weyhill crop circle. Thegeometry fitted, and by the end of the 1998 season, three major formations wouldalso demonstrate it.During a summer when farmers lost the majority of their grain crops to anincessant barrage of gales and rain, hoaxes appeared to account for a proportionof the crop formations, perhaps the worst count of hoaxes since 1992. At leastthree gangs were hard at work in the Avebury area, evidenced by the generalappearance of designs which, by early July, could be categorized by lack ofaesthetics alone. The bulk of the shoddy designs were attributed to newcomers,possibly inspired by the fresh wave of TV debunking. A “stingray” formation, forexample, had man-made elements grafted on to the original design, its tail inparticular.This appears to have generated a response from the real Circlemakers in the formof a nearby double pentagram, which came with a record of subsequent healthincidents. At West Woods, a pattern referred to as “The Queen” (figure 7.12[16_chapter07.html#fig7.12] on page 96) lay across the field from its earlier,mostly genuine counterpart; a raggedly executed fractal pattern allegedlycommissioned by a leading British newspaper was also attempted behind SilburyHill.Image [images/p95-01.jpg]Figure 7.10 Encoded geometry. Left: Triangular and pentagonal; Middle:Heptagonal; Right: The encoded geometry reveals two figures associated with theFreemasons, the set square and compass. Weyhill, 1998.Undeterred by the hoaxes, the first of the heptagonal patterns showed itself inthe East Field in mid-July. Two weeks later on August 8, a group of hoaxersattempted to upstage this by entering the field below Tawsmead Copse under coverof darkness. According to a personal communication to me from a member of theteam, they had barely started work when two balls of light chased them. Takingthis as a “Do not disturb this field” sign, the group left.Image [images/p95-02.jpg]Figure 7.11 “Double Pentagram,” with earlier “stingray” in the background.Beckhampton, 1998.Image [images/p96-01.jpg]Figure 7.12 “The Queen,” one of a number of hoaxes during 1998. West Woods.Their story appears to have some merit. Orange balls of light were seen flyingaround the copse that night by a group camping across the vale on Knapp Hill andby a second independent group sitting up on Adam's Grave long barrow. Then, at 5A.M., a resident walking in the direction of the copse saw the clouds part “asif two glass tubes had descended from the sky.” Two hours later, an elaborateseven-pointed fractal glyph appeared. (Incidentally, a separate witness saw thesame “glass tube” effect shortly before the appearance of the first West Woodsformation.)Although the formation was hastily cut down, a ground investigation of the newTawsmead heptagon revealed three magnetic features—positive, negative, andneutral—generated by the three sizes of grapeshot around its perimeter. Barely ahundred feet from the heptagon lay the beginnings of the hoaxers' simplecircle-and-ring.Image [images/p96-02.jpg]Figure 7.13 One of many predicted crop circles bearing sevenfold geometry.Tawsmead Copse, 1998.When a third heptagonal formation appeared below Danebury hill fort, I felt asif subconscious communication had indeed been going on, a feeling strengthenedwhen John Sayer, editor of the Cereologist, revealed to me that he had dreamtthe same design, and whose sketch is similar to the beautiful pinwheelformation.Someone else enjoying a close relationship with the Circlemakers was a youngphotographer named Tony Crerar, who on May 3 spent his time photographing thearea around Avebury, starting with views from the long barrow at West Kennett.By 3 A.M. the following morning, he had finished his assignment of photographingthe setting Moon from the strategic vantage point of the Sanctuary. From thisancient temple, Silbury Hill rose above the undulating landscape and glistenedin the pale moonlight; West Kennett Long Barrow lay to the left. Tony packed uphis gear and returned to his car for a quick snooze, but with the increasingchill in the air, he took a short drive to warm up instead.At half past four, he drove west. The rape field lying below the long barrowappeared pristine in the half-light of the creeping dawn. Upon his return to theSanctuary half an hour later, he saw that a formidable 250-foot-wide formationhad been imprinted on its golden surface (Crerar 1998). The ring of scallopededges enclosed a radial pattern comprising thirty-three “flames” spreadequidistantly around the circumference (requiring a bisection of 10.90909° foreach element). Seen from above, as the light reflected back the yellow of thestill-intact flowers, the pattern resembled a Roman mosaic, its center lyingtwenty feet into undisturbed crop.Image [images/p97-01.jpg]Figure 7.14 Sketch by the editor of the Cereologist predicting the pattern atDanebury.Image [images/p97-02.jpg]Figure 7.15 Complex heptagonal geometry is elegantly expressed in this curvingswastika, symbolic of the Sun and the seven notes of the pure music scale.Danebury hill fort, 1998.Image [images/p98-01.jpg]Figure 7.16 The thirty-three-flame “Beltane Wheel” appeared within a two-hourwindow. The central tracks were made later by people measuring the formation.West Kennett, 1998.The date of its appearance—three days after the Celtic solar festival ofBeltane—and the thirtythree “flames” show a definite connection. Traditionally,thirty-three is a solar number and in many religions it is associated withdivinity. Dividing the 365-day year by thirty-three gives 11.060606, with elevenyears representing the periodic recycling of sunspot activity, and 666 (amidstthe zeros), the number attributed to the Sun as well as the “Beast.”The Shilling family, out that morning to appreciate the dawn chorus of birds,had also driven past the same field at four-thirty when it was intact, yet ontheir return at a quarter to six the crop circle was there. They described theundamaged condition of the plants and the absence of footprints in the heavy dewand moist ground, something they could not prevent altering, even as they gentlymade their way in.The following morning, the BBC Wiltshire sound unit was conducting a radiointerview inside the crop glyph when havoc was wrought on a tape recorder, thetape speeding up so considerably that it stopped. When the interview wascontinued fifty yards outside the formation, the equipment resumed normaloperation; when the experiment was repeated inside the formation, the technicalproblems returned.Later in the day, a cynical crew from ITV Bristol Television also decided todrop by, so the Circlemakers decided to have a field day.The coverage was shown that evening with no overt signs of disruption, otherthan the fact that, for those who knew, the segment seemed very shortconsidering the time spent on-site by the crew. The next morning, FrancineBlake, who had chaperoned the film crew, received a call from the televisiontechnical staff explaining that the televised coverage had been short becausetheir sound system had been so disrupted that most of the recording had beenrendered useless. Just like the BBC before them, they were at a loss to accountfor the technical problems (Blake 1998).Image [images/p99-01.jpg]Figure 7.17 Geometry required to generate each of the thirty-three flames.Ironically, the BBC encountered a few problems of their own when they employedTeam Satan/circlemakers, plus Doug Bower, to remind their viewing audience thatcrop circles were nothing more than pretty designs made by a group of skillfulartists. Still basking in the glory of their venture on the other side of theglobe, Team Satan/circlemakers this time opted for a simple roulette of onehundred circles with a “Y” logo in the center (advertising the website Yell).The result was a geometrically flawed structure, presumably because a forty-ton,floodlight-wielding crane couldn't be so easily disguised in Wiltshire, or thedesign hadn't been staked out ahead of time.Instead, trodden circular paths marked the locations of areas to be planked,creating connecting paths between every circle, a feature that certainly had notbeen evident in the vastly superior “Triple Julia Set” until people began towalk its labyrinth of circles. Team Satan's Rod Dickinson later announced hiswork to be on a par with the “Triple Julia,” but conveniently forgot to mentionthat his team's artwork was three times smaller, geometrically immature, andunlike its predecessor, recorded no anomalies—electromagnetically,biophysically, or otherwise.Most embarrassing for the BBC was that the broadcasting station's foray into theundercover world of deception was thwarted within an hour of theirwork-in-progress, when the group was caught in flagrante despite the cloak ofdarkness. This demonstrated how much harder it is to avoid detection when youtry such a venture in a country where, unlike New Zealand, its inhabitantsoutnumber the sheep.A few yards away, Doug Bower had been having problems of his own when hemiscalculated the diameter of his simple thirty-foot circle. So with dawnencroaching, an exhausted Team Satan/circlemakers was drafted to help theveteran complete the project that had now mistakenly doubled in size.Image [images/p99-02.jpg]Figure 7.18 More impressive from the air than on the ground. TeamSatan/circlemakers' effort. Milk Hill, 1998.This footage was later aired on the BBC's Country File. One of its stated aimswas “Could we create a complex crop circle at night without getting caught?” Asthey had been caught—ironically by another group of hoaxers—the answer wouldseem to be “No.”Such are the coincidences in this phenomenon.However, a second and subtler aim appears to have been disinformation. Theprogram was strategically aired to preempt credibility or interest in the newcrop circle season and to stir up animosity to all things circular in the mindsof its principal viewing audience, the farming community. Judging by thedismissiveness and hostility of farmers during subsequent attempts to secureaccess to their land, the desired effect was achieved.An air of suspicion had also hung around the steady “disappearing act” by DaveChorley. Throughout the years of interviews, Bower and Chorley's stories rarelymatched, in fact, they became so contradictory that Chorley was increasinglykept out of the limelight. If anything, Chorley gave the impression of beingtired of the whole affair. At one point, Paul Vigay (who had on occasioncommunicated with him) felt that he might be ready to go public with the story.Vigay would never know if his premonition was accurate or if he was beingoverdramatic, because barely a week later Chorley was dead.37Despite the media's shenanigans, crop circles did not entirely evaporate fromthe public mind in 1998. On the contrary, with crude formations now advertisingcigars, crop circles entered mass culture, even if it meant the sacred and themysterious became adulterated by marketing. Since hoaxers faced criminalprosecution, these “advertisements” allowed some of their makers to publiclyclaim their work, and in so doing, exposed their methods.Writing about Team Satan/circlemakers' “van” crop circle—commissioned byMitsubishi—Rod Dickinson said: “Uncharacteristically the formation was madeduring daylight. It took the three of us twelve hours to complete due to thecomplexity of the design—which had numerous centre-points and compound curves tofind and create—and the need for absolute accuracy, the formation wouldn't bemuch use if it didn't look like the car it was supposed to be representing.”38A completion time of twelve hours in daylight? It makes one wonder how hemanaged those perfect logarithmic curves of the Triple Julia Set (the formationso prominently displayed on his website) in five hours of darkness.The Mitsubishi commission provided clear evidence of the team's involvement inmaking a crop circle. However, the following year, they became involved in amore sinister event. On August 7, 1999, a three-page article entitled “The NightThose UFOs Didn't Land” appeared in the British tabloid The Daily Mail. Thestory by Sam Taylor and photographer Nick Holt described how the newspaper hadcommissioned Team Satan/circlemakers to create an elaborate formation atAvebury, comprising a series of circles arranged within a triangular area, witheach circle inscribed with lines to create the illusion of 3-D cubes. Theformation appeared on July 28, yet for some reason the up-to-the-minutenewspaper printed the story ten days after the event.Their team of eight people claims to have slid unnoticed into the field at 11:30P.M., and for the next six hours Taylor and Holt are supposed to have watchedthe formation being made. When morning came, visitors were interviewed and theirmost outrageous theories as to the origins and effects of this circle made thepaper for the purpose of ridicule. So far, the story appeared to run true toform, but then the problems started.At eleven that evening, Chad Deetken, his wife, and three friends were walkingalong the avenue of stones leading into the Avebury circle, taking advantage ofthe bright moonlight. After their friends left, the Deetkens stayed there untilhalf-past midnight.The field in which the hoax was supposedly being perpetrated adjoins this avenueof stones and has a twenty-five-foot incline. By 12:30 A.M. the design shouldhave been well in progress yet the Deetkens, standing in front of where itshould be, recall no disturbance in the moonlit field. Two hours later, thesleepless manager of the book shop (700 feet away, overlooking the field) lookedout of his window and also saw an undisturbed wheat field. Two other witnesseswalked by this site at 3 and 4 A.M., respectively, and still no design wasvisible.So where was the group? The newspaper report claims “the light was so bad,” andyet the countryside was visible that night thanks to clear skies and a moon sofull and bright you could read small print in a newspaper. The account alsoclaims they had climbed an eight-bar gate to access the field, but there are noeight-bar gates in the vicinity, and besides, gates in Wiltshire are generallyfive- or six-bar. Perhaps they'd stumbled into the wrong county? Or more likely,into the realm of fiction.Deetken called the newspaper several times to speak to Taylor or Holt forclarification, but got no response. In fact, attempts over the next few monthsby several researchers (and myself) to speak to them proved fruitless. The papercouldn't even clarify if these people existed. Eventually, calls made to SamTaylor were transferred to a desk at a rival tabloid, the Daily Mirror.Answering the phone call at the other end turned out to be none other than Dougand Dave's mentor, Graham Brough.Another scam had been fostered upon an unsuspecting British public. TeamSatan/circlemakers had laid claim to someone else's formation—an example of“seduction by suggestion.”39 But whose formation was it? From the ground and theair, the evidence did not immediately point to a supernatural source either, asthe authenticity of the design was far from convincing.Image [images/p101-01.jpg]Figure 7.19 Geometric overlay reveals the discrepancies in the design claimed byTeam Satan/circlemakers. Avebury, 1999.At the time, I remember being puzzled by two crop circles that seemed to fitneither the normal human involvement pattern nor that of the real phenomenon;these were different. The brittle plants showed that an excessive amount of heathad been used, and the soil, sticky to the touch on the outside, was powdery onthe inside—even more so than is normal in a crop circle, and tests forelectromagnetism gave no response. The designs also seemed to have sprung fromthe head of a machine rather than the heart of a sentient being: the first was aset of three interlocking crescents beside Barbury Castle; the second was theAvebury hoax. The words “microwave” and “military” popped into my head, andremained there.Weeks passed. Then one afternoon I met with a friend, a respected psychic, whowas visiting from America. I shared with her various photos of the season's cropcircles, pausing over the Barbury and Avebury formations. Without any proddingfrom me, the same two words came up: microwave and military.Months later I discussed the Avebury scam with Marcus Allen, UK editor of Nexusmagazine and a former private investigator. “Look at the field where the Aveburyformation was laid,” he said. “Look at how little is growing there this season;in fact, how anything growing there looks stunted, even the weeds, as if thearea has been microwaved and made sterile.” This was indeed the case at Avebury,so I returned to the site at Barbury to see if Marcus's suspicions were founded.All around where the formation had been there was nothing but stunted growth.What eventually turned 1999 into a positive year was the extraordinary show ofstrength mounted by the real Circlemakers. Since many of the designs are dealtwith in greater detail later in this book, I will only touch on a fewsignificant highlights here. The year 1999 heralded ninefold geometry, and asignificant number of the formations were predicted, further validating thetwo-way exchange between the circle-making force and its human recipients.In April, the crop circles demonstrated an affinity for our wonder with theforthcoming solar eclipse by displaying a 640-foot pictogram showing the Mooncovering the Sun, in nine stages. At Hakpen Hill, a vortex crop glyph featurednine in-flowing spirals, three of which flattened at their cusps, and tookresearchers the best part of a year to figure out. On the final day of theancient Aztec calendar came a nine-coiled “serpent” in the East Field, whoseback-combed lay resembled the DNA strand. Was this glyph symbolic ofQuetzalcoatl, the Aztec god described as a feathered serpent?Image [images/p102-01.jpg]Figure 7.20 Was microwave technology involved in the making of these cropcircles? All Cannings, Barbury Castle, Devil's Den, 1999.The importance behind this play on nine was later discovered in heliocentricastrological charts for December, which depicted the planets and principalasteroids in three grand trines around the Sun, creating a nine-pointed star inthe solar system.Image [images/p103-01.jpg]Figure 7.21 Selected crop circles of 1999.Two geometric “nets” were presented, the first as an unfolded octahedron (aneight-sided Platonic solid) and the second as an unfolded interlocking squarethat, when folded, resembled an Aztec swastika. It was as if the Circlemakerswere indulging in a game of origami. This latter formation appeared barely twohundred yards from Aztec elder Tlakaelel's “site of the last ceremonial dance.”The suggestion of a thematic move in design from 2-D to 3-D developed as theseason progressed, reinforced by an unmistakable cube which appeared near thesite of the Mandelbrot crop circle of eight years earlier. Suddenly anddramatically, the designs were acquiring perspective.Image [images/p104-01.jpg]Figure 7.22 “Nine Spirals.” The flattened curves employ a complex and obscuremathematical method of construction last used in stone circles. Notsurprisingly, no one claimed this crop circle. Hakpen Hill, 1999.This change in dimensional perception developed even more throughout 2000, whenthe crop circles focused on grid curvature and visual illusion. Some designspointed to an understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity and quantumphysics, in which space and time are interconnected to form a four-dimensionalcontinuum and particles are seen as processes rather than objects.The first example of the projection of a fourdimensional body inthree-dimensional space—a sphere stretching through a net—appeared along thewestern flank of Windmill Hill (see figure 7.27 [16_chapter07.html#fig7.27] onpage 108). This was followed by a large grid square at East Kennett, constructedfrom 1600 flattened and standing portions, subtly graded into four squares, eachgiving the perception of cubes alternately descending into and rising out of theEarth (see figures 7.28 and 7.29 on page 108). By its very nature, the way thedesign was seen from above depended on the angle of the light, so according tothe time of day, what seemed “up” was also “down,” and “concave” became“convex.”Image [images/p104-02.jpg]Figure 7.23 A ground survey of the “Coiled Serpent” glyph shows the intricatefloor lay. Note the tiny vortices at the tip of each spear. Alton Barnes, 1999.What was being conveyed here? That other levels of reality exist beyond ourlimited senses of perception? Perhaps the Circlemakers were retraining ourvisual perception, for such a holographic effect presents a challenge for theviewer to question his or her relationship to the image presented, in the sameway the visual paradoxes of artists such as M. C. Escher and Monika Bush teachthe eye to “see” differently.These “cross-dimensional” crop circles were supported by a series of flower cropglyphs referencing those invisible wheels of energy, the chakras. Of particularmerit was a sixteenpetaled mandala relating to the throat chakra (see figure7.31 [16_chapter07.html#fig7.31] on page 108); a “sunflower” relating to thecrown chakra; and a six-petaled lotus flower (with the sixth petal folded)relating to the sacral chakra.40 (See figure 7.30 on page A7 in the colorsection.)At the southern end of the Windmill Hill complex appeared one such “wheel ofenergy.” For some, the radiating pattern was obviously an idealizedrepresentation of Earth's magnetic field; for others, it bore a similarity to asplitting chromosome, even a stylized plan of the hemispheres of the humanbrain. Regardless of the interpretation, the visual impact was startling, fordespite the appearance of radiating bands, not one curve was used, not even tobuild the two dipoles. The whole illusion was created by straight lines whichwere the result of plants laid in wave patterns. Where these lines converged ateach dipole, the strands of upright wheat were finessed down to four or fivestanding plants (see figures 7.32 [16_chapter07.html#fig7.32] and 7.33[16_chapter07.html#fig7.33] on page 109).Image [images/p105-01.jpg]Figure 7.24 “Origami” crop circles. Top: Clatford formation folds into anoctahedron. Incidentally, the grapeshot are not circles, but tiny hexagons.Bottom: Silbury formation folds into an Aztec-type swastika.Image [images/p106-01.jpg]Figure 7.25 3-D crop glyphs. Beckhampton and Wimpole Hall, 1999.The appearance of the “magnetic grid” crop glyph proved timely. The previousnight, a sleepless Colin Andrews had been juggling with the image of a magneticgrid, probably because the subject was foremost on his mind. A few days later,Andrews announced that his research between 1999 and 2000 into the effects ofcrop circles and magnetism showed that in 5 percent of crop circles he'danalyzed, the Earth's magnetic grid deviated by 3 to 5 degrees.The Circlemakers may have been eavesdropping on his thoughts, soon thereafteroffering validation in the shape of a ring torus crop glyph. Divided into elevencircular rotations (requiring the division of a circle into 32.72°), eachsegment had shifted approximately 4 to 5 degrees, giving the torus's doughnutshape a three-dimensional quality (see figure 7.34 [16_chapter07.html#fig7.34]on page 110).Despite the encouraging news, Andrews was besieged by hostility, even deaththreats, from the crop circle community, particularly from those who had by nowstaked their reputations on any and every depression in plants being the productof some supernatural force. Understandably, Andrews' next revelation that 80percent of crop circles he'd investigated during those two seasons had possiblybeen made by humans was anathema to those with strong opinions on the subject orwhose vested interests now stood naked in this controversy.So, a harmless scientific inquiry cascaded into a mudslinging debate on what wasgenuine and what was hoaxed, once again demonstrating the degree to which thecrop circle community has allowed itself to become polarized. There was noquestion that many human-made crop circles were being perpetrated during thisperiod. One example was a heart-shaped formation at East Kennett, constructedfor a wedding with the farmer's permission. Another was a simple sevenpointedstar, the perpetrator of which, Matthew Williams, was arrested and fined.Yet another appeared not far from Barbury Castle: 400- by 460-foot designincorporating the Star Trek logo, an arrow, and Einstein's famous E = MC2equation. Commissioned by the Science Museum in London for an upcomingexhibition, the project was described by one of the artists involved as “one ofthe hardest tasks I have ever performed. . . . We were struggling to createstraight lines and right angles. There is no way anyone will convince me thatthese highly complex crop circles are easy to make or that they can be doneovernight and in darkness. . . . The Star Trek construction was simple andangular, but took two days to complete, and the crop inside was a mess; all ofit broke, totally wrecked” (Cochrane 2001).Image [images/p107-01.jpg]Figure 7.26 Selected crop circles of 2000.Regardless of the human hullabaloo, the real phenomenon moved on with itsagenda. As the Sun descended over a huge “sunflower” crop glyph resting betweenthe summits of Picked and Woodborough hills, the season finale of 2000 onceagain presented a taste of wonders to come. Here, the Circlemakers abandoned theuse of circles as a method of construction by presenting a formation createdpurely from forty-four rotations of nature's own spiral, the Golden Mean (alsoknown as phi) each expression requiring a curve in the ratio of 1:1.6180339.Together with its fourteen concentric rings, the design referenced 44/14, or22/7, the convenient ratio for that other mathematical incommensurable, pi.

Avebury Trusloe, 2000.There is no doubt that the presence of crop circles has become a thorn in theside of orthodox science, creating unease in those engaged in shaping our beliefsystems, for as fast as crop circles attract new converts, the more effort isapplied to discredit them. The Establishment—whether government, medicalinstitution, chemical conglomerate, or Academe—debunks anything “new” to giveitself a chance to familiarize itself with so-called unorthodox ideas, own them,and finally make them available to the public once political, military, and/orcommercial profit can be made. A good example is the current war on“alternative” medicine. After systematically trashing holistic medicine, themedical industry is increasingly becoming a major shareholder in the supposedly“quack” companies involved in the practice or manufacture of so-called“alternative” cures.Image [images/p109-02.jpg]Figure 7.33 The Magnetic Grid's linear geometry creates the 3-D effect of asphere.Such centralized control by the few has generally proved an impediment to theadvancement of every race, and to understand this is to understand one of theprimary functions behind the rise in crop circles, as we shall see in part 2.Image [images/p110-01.jpg]Figure 7.34 Torus ring references a 4° twist in Earth's magnetic grid in eachsegment. North Down, 1999.Human history has a sad legacy of antagonism towards the “new,” and ironically,those who are least qualified to comment on a new subject are also those mostactively engaged in denouncing it. For instance, the ancient Greeks were awareof fossils and knew that life on Earth was far older than was accounted for.With the rise of Roman Catholicism, however, there came about a contemptuousattitude towards geology and science, particularly if the findings were at oddswith reworked scripture. At one point, theology became so fundamentalist that4004 B.C. was set as the official date of creation; arguments even raged overwhich day in October it had occurred. And St. Augustine's personal distaste ofastronomy alone held back advances in the study of the heavens for twelvecenturies—yes, 1,200 years (White 1896). Even as late as the eighteenth century,we find scientists forced to recant their views in publicly humiliating fashion,as Galileo once discovered for himself.If religious might hasn't been enough of a detriment to the advancement ofknowledge (of its rediscovery), the conservative belief system within thescientific community sometimes produces obstacles of its own. Take the case ofJohann Beringer, prominent professor of the University of Wurzburg and physicianto the Prince-Bishop. During the mideighteenth century, Berenger, too, uncoveredfossils, yet the news was received by the church with as much glee as a deliveryof pork to a synagogue. His discoveries were also at odds with the scientificviewpoint of the day, and in order to discredit him, two of Berenger'speers—Professor Ignatz Roderique, and Privy Councilor Georg von Eckart—hoaxed anumber of look-alike fossils and paid one of Berenger's excavators to reversethe habits of his profession and surreptitiously bury the fakes throughout thedig.Unfortunately for them, the plan backfired, for Berenger took delight in the newfinds, considered them authentic, and lectured widely on the subject. Roderiqueand Eckart, bemused by the apparent failure of their hoax, created ever moreelaborate carvings on rocks, at one point inscribing in Arabic the name ofJehovah. Only when Berenger published his findings in 1872 did the twopranksters own up to the world. The ensuing scandal succeeded in not onlydiscrediting Berenger's original, valid discoveries, but also disgracedRoderique and Eckart (John and Wolf 1963).That these two men were prepared to risk their reputations demonstrates howseriously the status quo takes the threat to its established views, and theobvious parallel to events throughout research into crop circles requires nofurther explanation. It also serves as a lesson to researchers and discreditorsalike.Image [images/p111-01.jpg]Figure 7.35 “Sunflower,” the glory of 2000. Woodborough Hill.Image [images/p111-02.jpg]Figure 7.36 Each spiral requires knowledge of φ or phi, that is, the division ofan area to the ratio 1:1.6180339, the Golden Mean.The current ridiculing or outright silencing of crop circles investigationsthroughout the media follows the established trend for subjects that threatenthe interests of large groups. One could say television and newspaper companyowners are responsible for instigating a cover-up, or that journalists have beenlax in “digging up” valuable evidence, even though it has been available to themall along. However, it is important to recognize that the majority of worldwidemedia companies are not now in control of their own destinies. Many aresubsidiaries of multi-national parent companies whose lobbyists have a richhistory of directly influencing government policies.These policies are inevitably fostered upon an unsuspecting public throughmanipulation of editorial content in media outlets, in which these organizationshave either vested financial interests, or control large portions of theadvertising budget that makes or breaks a newspaper or television station.Either way, the power of the “system” to sway public opinion should not beunderestimated.Claire Hope Cummings makes a case in point: “Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television,which owns and operates most television stations in the United States, actuallyshelved a series which documented damaging evidence against the use of hormonesin dairy cows and connections between biotechnology giant Monsanto and U.S.government agencies. According to two award-winning reporters commissioned toprepare the story, its removal came just days after Monsanto pressured Fox NewsNetwork to drop the series” (1999).Changing a worldview requires either a major leap in thinking or an event ofoverwhelming magnitude, such as the crop circle phenomenon. Leaps in massunderstanding inevitably undermine the vested interests of the few who staketheir reputations, positions, and livelihoods on the “official” perception ofthe truth. Therefore, the status quo will resist any attempt at anyone elserewriting history.Back in 1991, the German political correspondent Jürgen Krönig made a succinct,almost prophetic observation about this state of affairs when he wrote:Crop circles have initiated a psycho-social mass phenomenon. They haveaccelerated an already existing process of change in belief systems. People ofall classes, age groups and educational backgrounds are moved by the circles,one could say that the phenomenon helps to break down barriers between peoplewho normally find it difficult to communicate with each other without havingbeen introduced formally.It's ironic how so many are appearing in England then! To quote Krönig again:Paradigm shifts are accompanied by conflicts. The resistance of the old orderwill become stronger, the more they feel that their position is under threat.The scientific orthodoxy will close ranks and will increase, not least with thehelp of their media allies, the attack on “dangerous irrationalism.” Currentevents around crop circles have presented us with examples. The activity of thegroups of so-called debunkers is an indication of the growing irritation of therepresentatives of the old worldview. . . . But in the long run, the only peoplewho will have the wool pulled over their eyes are those who don't want to seeanything anyway (Krönig 1991).For all the claims that all crop circles are nothing more than human hoaxes,precious little evidence exists to back up human involvement. In fact, whenfaced with facts, hoaxers are generally elusive and reluctant to list theirclaimed designs or to explain their noteworthy features. Recollections of datesand locations prove problematic, details on modes of operation contradictory andoften mathematically incorrect.Researcher Paul Vigay sums up the hoax argument:Hoaxers must be able to prove that all formations are hoaxes, for it is theythat claim the subject to be a hoax. All the hoaxers have to do is stop hoaxing,that way there would be no more circles. The biggest problem for them is that ofthe genuine phenomenon. As they have no control over the “real” circles, theycannot force the phenomenon to stop merely because they stop. Therefore, eachyear, as genuine formations start to appear, the hoaxers have to come forwardand say “yes, we did them.” They cannot simply give up hoaxing as this willreveal the genuine formations. Hoaxers have effectively given themselves nooption but to continue hoaxing for as long as the genuine phenomenon persists(Vigay 1994).The fallow days between Christmas and the New Year are typically a time whenindividuals in the public eye, policy-makers, or corporations quietly approachthe media to retract statements, make reversals in policy, or pass controversiallegislation, the public being distracted by celebrations and hangovers. It wasin this spirit that articles appeared in the British press on Sunday, December27, 1998, bearing a statement by Doug Bower claiming an “unknown force wasbehind the corn circles,” and that it had instructed him to make the elaboratepatterns (Brownlee 1998).Either the phenomenon's most publicized hoaxer believes that behind the sceneslies more than the “hand of man,” or preparations were being made for the nextOperation Status Quo.32Qabbalah (also spelled Kabbala and Cabala) is a key to the spiritual mysteriesof scripture generally associated with the Jewish faith, although its knownorigins date back to the Chaldeans.33These lines of electromagnetic energy—geodetic lines—form a type of Earthenergy grid, and will be discussed in length in later chapters.34The earliest known origin of this design is Asia Minor. To the Hindus it wasthe Sign of Vishnu, and they used it as a talisman against evil. Today it adornsthe flag of Israel.35John Lundberg and Rod Dickinson, the circlemakers' website(www.circlemakers.org [http://www.circlemakers.org]), April 1998.36My thanks to Doug Parker and Dr. Jonathan Sherwood for obtaining the initialinformation. The story was reported by John Cutt, “No UFO Over Dunearn” in TheSouthland Times.

Could this be theformation the group actually made?40“Chakra” is Sanskrit for “spinning wheel of energy.” The chakras form acollection of vortices that facilitate the entry of energy into major organs,and endocrine or hormonal glands. Six of the seven principal chakras aresymbolized by a lotus flower of various petals, each associated with a sound orvibration, and corresponding to the sound of each of the fifty letters of theSanskrit alphabet. Ironically, there are 50 sounds capable of being vocalized bythe human being. This is why Sanskrit is called Dev Bani—the language of thegods."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOEVIDENCE AND PURPOSE"},{"pageContent":"8. LIVING PROOFIt is perfectly natural to ask if the circles are hoaxes, but very difficult toexplain why they cannot be hoaxed satisfactorily.—Pat DelgadoAs we have seen throughout the first part of this book, weather doesn't explaincrop circles. So who or what is making them? And how?The other most plausible answer is that of the hand of man. However, despite therise in hoaxing, it appears that man has merely aped and appropriated aphenomenon that was not of his doing to begin with.Hoaxers generally refuse authorship of any particular design, claimingconveniently that doing so ruins the “notion of the artwork” (although theprospect of prison may also be a motivating factor). In which case, shouldartists such as Van Gogh have refrained from signing their masterpieces, too,leaving themselves to be swallowed by the swamps of anonymity and their artworkto be claimed by every opportunist or failed art school student?“Art without knowledge is nothing,” remarked the enlightened eleventh-centuryAbbot Suger. So let us examine crop circles in closer detail to get a sense ofthe mechanics at work, and see what differentiates beauty from the beast.TIME OF CREATION“It wasn't there the night before, but I saw it first thing this morning” is thestock-in-trade statement from bewildered farmers making their rounds at thecrack of dawn, and it's a sentiment shared by baffled researchers andenthusiasts after damp, all-night vigils. So exactly how long does it take for acrop circle to manifest?During a dusk watch of the crop-circlefriendly Devil's Punchbowl at CheesefootHead in 1986, Don Tuersley and Pat Delgado sat observing the field withnight-vision binoculars; below lay a large circle and ring formation. Bymidnight nothing had stirred, except the fine drizzle that suddenly began toinfiltrate the scene. With the first light at 3:45 A.M. came a new circle andring to the south—yet they saw and heard nothing (Andrews and Delgado 1991).Image [images/p118-01.jpg]Figure 8.1 An incoming spiral has entered the circle from the left, split intotwo (where the person is kneeling), and swirled clockwise towards the centerwhere it is then overlaid by a central fan of plants. The second half of thespiral completes the circle's wall, and where the flows merge, the plants areplatted over and under, suggesting an extremely rapid process. Roundway, 1999.Hundreds of other accounts suggest a brief time window. Less than two hours wasthe gap between two German tourists reporting nothing unusual from the summit ofSilbury Hill to the appearance beside it of the 126-circle “Koch fractal”—in themiddle of the afternoon, at the height of tourist season. Fifteen minutes wasthe time allocated for the “Julia Set” at Stonehenge, again in daylight. Therest of the crop circles seem to materialize quietly between 3 A.M. and shortlybefore sunrise.However, an estimated time window is not the same as the actual constructiontime. From his experience, Pat Delgado believes that twenty seconds is possiblythe maximum time of construction: “We conclude this because to achieve aswirled, flattened condition pressed hard to the ground, the stems must have amaximum vertical-to-horizontal transformation time, above which they would bedamaged by whiplash” (ibid.). Delgado's thesis is supported by scores offirst-hand accounts, all of which claim a whorl motion lasting between five totwenty seconds, regardless of the final size. This is substantiated by the eventcaught by Nippon TV's camera crew at Bratton (T. Wilson 1998).SOIL AND WATERIt was an unusually crowd-free morning inside the “yin-yang” crop formationbelow Liddington hill fort, so much so that the peace allowed me some preciousmoments to ponder over the circle-making process.Without spin nothing works, and in nature, spin develops into unfolding vorticesin the shape of spirals. Given the spiral nature of crop circles, I reasonedthat the Circlemakers could be harnessing some type of natural principle, andsince nature is governed by principles that are by-and-large electromagnetic,whatever process lies behind crop circles must be leaving traces. So, just asColin Andrews once received a dramatic reply to his cry for an answer to theriddle, mine came in the thought “Smell the plants, you idiot!”Image [images/p119-01.jpg]Figure 8.2 Close-up of rock from a crop circle shows the wheat stems have beenflash-burned onto its surface.I reached down and cut the base of stems in the fresh crop glyph. They exuded amalty fragrance, as if the water within the plants had been heated and cookedthem from the inside. The lower parts of the stems were superficially charred,too. I recalled how farmer Joe Rennick in Saskatchewan had noticed the soilwithin his crop circle had been baked hard as cement, yet throughout the rest ofhis field it was moist and muddy. Canadian researcher Chad Deetken noticed thisas well and said that 60 percent of crop circles appear during rainy nights(Deetken 1993). I remembered how during my tour in the Litchfield “torc”formation I found the soil loose and powdery, how at certain points it was evencracked, and how I had found a lump of carbon in the center.I compiled my own data: in 50 percent of crop circles visited, the soil insidenew crop circles was noticeably drier compared to the tackier texture fartheraway from the center. Formations indicating human involvement showed no suchdiscrepancy; rain prior to or during inspection, and patterns older than twodays were discounted.In August 2000, I compared two new formations, across the road from each otherat All Cannings, where the plants and soil were identical in type and texture.The first formation was a modest nine-pointed star, with hand-made features thatleft me unimpressed and which exhibited no electromagnetic anomalies. The soilwas as sticky to the touch inside the circle as it was outside. But across theroad, the soil inside the rose pattern was not just dry, but was powdered to thepoint it could be blown away.Image [images/p119-02.jpg]Figure 8.3 Intense heat has split the interior of this immature barley plant.A middle-aged couple vacationing nearby told me they had witnessed a large ovalcraft with a rim of bright lights hovering over the location the previous night,yet because of their low position behind a hedge, they could not confirm thatthe craft had made the circle. One thing was certain: all the stems in this cropformation were bone dry and brittle, and between the two nodes nearest theground, they had exploded. Compared to other crop circles I have analyzed, thiswas an extreme example, for generally the plants are just superficially charred.Image [images/p120-01.jpg]Figure 8.5 Distribution of crop circles in southern England relative towater-bearing strata.Historically, crop circles have strategically referenced aquifers, ponds, wells,or underground tanks (Andrews and Delgado 1991). There is also adisproportionately large number of incidences in which circles appear over areaswhere the groundwater is close to the surface, primarily in southern Englandwhere the chalk aquifer, the deepest in the world, provides an excellentmoisture trap.Historian Brian Grist has made a detailed analysis of the positioning of cropcircle events and shows how the majority prefer aquiferous ground. Thispreference for sites bearing a vital relationship with water was further borneout when, in the dry summers of 1989 and 1990, the circles “appeared closer tothe edge of the aquifer . . . causing one to wonder whether or not theirplacements might in some way be influenced by the relative position ofsubsurface water levels at the moments in time when the events occurred” (Grist1991).Similar conclusions were independently reached and reinforced by Steve Page andGlen Broughton ten years later when they found 78.6 percent of recorded cropcircles appeared over chalk and greensand (a mixture of sandstone and greenearth). When the placement of aquifers is taken into consideration, the figurerises to 87.2 percent (Page and Broughton 1999).So there appears to be a connection between water and the formative energy ofcrop circles, and given its effect on the plants and soil, it appears togenerate some form of intense heat. With this in mind, I ordered some infraredfilm.Kodak Color Infrared film is unique, not least because it renders photographs infalse color, giving landscapes a psychedelic quality. It's used prominently inmedicine and archaeology for its ability to detect variations in heat;consequently it is applied in aerial photography to uncover buried sites orinspect the health of fields or rivers.After I examined aerial infrared shots of crop circles, a streak of enhanceddiscoloration appeared to cross their boundaries, a feature I could not find tothe same degree in shots of neighboring fields. In cases involving matureplants, there were streaks of dark red, indicative of a higher chlorophyllcontent, as if a localized energy source had triggered a sudden burst of growthactivity. And the newer the formation, the stronger the result (see figures8.6–8.10 on page A9 in the color section).Interestingly, aerial shots of known hoaxes showed no such discrepancies.Another observation I made again dealt with the Litchfield “torc” formation.This revealed a patch of discoloration running through the center of theimmature wheat. These results matched ground observations which showed the soilto be drier, suggesting the surface moisture inside the formation had beendepleted.The tests continued for three years. Photos were also taken at ground level,both one day and then one week after the appearance of each formation. Theresults indicated a marked decrease in the heat-induced variation of thechlorophyll over the period; aerial photographs also showed less of a disruptionof surface water. I applied the same protocol to known hoaxes: no discolorationswere evident at any time, nor did the heat content vary over the week.I sent the images to Kodak for further analysis, but the helpful technicianswere as puzzled as I. The images included in this book are culled from shotstaken under similar weather conditions and time parameters. Since this area ofinquiry is still in its infancy, I cannot qualify the results as any kind ofproof, but merely as another set of anomalies. However, the groundwaterconnection persists, particularly in light of a crop circle's appearance in aJapanese rice field which displaced a volume of water comparable to the cubicarea of the formation itself.41Pure water in itself is not a conductor of electrical current. To be so, waterrequires a significant amount of dissolved minerals as part of its chemicalmakeup, and it just so happens that the water in the southern English aquifer issaturated with alkaline chalk. Chalk is a piezoelectric substance (it builds astatic charge under pressure) composed of small prehistoric sea creatures, allcontaining tiny amounts of magnetite that once enabled them to orient to theEarth's magnetic field. The net effect of billions of pieces of magnetite lockedtogether and pressurized, together with the energized groundwater, is thecreation of a low magnetic field. This is especially so if the chalk is spreadover a substantial geographic area, which the southern English chalk beds are.That combination makes this part of the world one of the largest naturalconductors of electrical energy.John Burke, one of the three members of the Massachusetts-based research groupBurke Levengood Talbot (BLT), has been studying the relationship between theunderground aquifer, water table, and crop circle occurrence since 1992.According to his research, the Wiltshire aquifer has had some of the highestseasonal fluctuations, which coincide with a process called adsorption, anelectrical charge created by water percolating through porous rock. Burkecomments:When you've got a lot of water in an underground aquifer or water tablefluctuating through the porous chalk, a lot of electric ground current iscreated. We were able to measure that in numerous ways in 1993. Such currentsare taking place in the ground and creating signature magnetic fields. Wemeasured the actual electric current with electrodes in the fields and sitesthat are getting the most and the largest crop circle activity. Around SilburyHill, in the two days following a thunderstorm, as the water settled into thissurface chalk aquifer, it created these electric ground currents. We did amagnetic survey in the field and detected wide variations in the magnetic fieldsthere. Four days later it received a major formation. Four days after that were-surveyed that field and the variations had evened out (Burke 1998).Burke found similar correspondences between crop circles in North America andthe limestone aquifer which underlies the Great Plains. Limestone is thechemical twin of chalk and the next most porous rock.42Confirmation of other unusual behavior in the ground under crop circles camefrom a number of separate sources. In 1990, crop and soil samples from aformation at Culhampton (Devon) were sent to Delawarr Laboratories in Oxford forradionics analysis. A comparative test revealed the affected plants' vitalityhad been reduced by 20 percent; the soil showed a depletion of nitrates by 40percent, and phosphates and sulfates by 30 percent; and elevations of cobalt,carbon, molybdenum, titanium, plutonium, and zinc were noted, elevations notevident in control samples. The report concluded that a “fierce and quick heat .. . has denatured the soil and destroyed natural elements” (Delgado 1992).Two years later, American physicist Michael Chorost announced that preliminarytests on crop formations had unearthed four unusual radioactive isotopes(vanadium, europium, tellurium, and ytterbium) with a short half-life (the decayrate of radioactive nuclides). None were naturally occurring (Chorost and Dudley1992a).A survey with a Geiger counter revealed how one of the 1994 “scorpions” had abackground radiation level 50 percent below normal at the edges, yet 150 percentabove at the center. Below Oldbury hill fort a military team sealed off thefield while checking for background radiation inside a large pictogram thatregistered radiation 300 percent above normal—or so they claimed—the only knowncase of its type.During Project Argus, an endeavor by the Center for Crop Circles Studies whichused gamma-ray spectroscopy and DNA analysis to track anomalies in formations,the most compelling set of results came from the magnetic surveys of soilsamples in and around crop circles. The tests were performed by an investigatorwith no knowledge that some of the formations had been deliberately manufacturedfor the project. He detected a high percentage of anomalies demonstrating arelationship to the visible boundaries of the crop circles, the implicationbeing that the ferrites (iron compounds) in the soil inside genuine crop circleshad been magnetized (Chorost and Dudley 1992b).Further soil samples were tested in the U.S. by Chorost's partner, nuclearphysicist Marshall Dudley, and showed dramatic discrepancies in alpha radiation,varying from 27 percent below to 198 percent above average (ibid.). Alpharadiation consists of tiny electrically charged, highspeed particles and is oneof the three types of radiation emitted by radioactive substances. Dudley addedthat since the radiation is short-lived, it is unlikely that health risks areinvolved in people exposed to crop circles, although he suggested that peopleavoid visiting one within an hour of its appearance until normal radiationlevels are regained. This could explain why the Circlemakers go about their workpredominantly during the night when most normal people are sleeping and awayfrom the fields.Image [images/p123-01.jpg]Figure 8.11 Magnetic field strength around wire carrying a current. (See alsofigure 8.14 [18_chapter08.html#fig8.14].)The tests continued. The CCCS then commissioned ADAS research laboratory inCambridge to analyze soil samples from fifteen formations. The results indicatedsome cases of unusually high levels of nitrates in the soil following theappearance of a crop circle.43 Although the results were not conclusive, it isimportant to note there are only two ways to raise the nitrate level in soil:through over-application of fertilizer or by administering an extremely highelectrical charge (Green 1996).Dudley independently confirmed the presence of chemical alterations in otherEnglish soil samples and showed how they were able to absorb more water afterbeing exposed to this unusual energy source. A possible explanation lies in theexcitement of the local magnetic field, whereby oxygen atoms behave differentlybecause magnetism affects the way they bond with other compounds. During adehydration process, oxygen atoms are less abundant. Dudley's data also showedhow soil composition and radiation readings fluctuate depending on theirlocation in the crop circle. Why the inconsistency?Image [images/p124-01.jpg]Figure 8.12 Electromagnetic transverse wave.Since energy is composed of vibrations or waveforms with peaks and troughs (alsoknown as nodes and antinodes), it is feasible that when the crop circle energysource interacts with the ground a shockwave spreads outwards like ripples in apond. There is a principle in physics that highlights this. A wire carrying anelectric current has an associated magnetic field whose field lines are detectedas a series of concentric rings; however, the field strength is reduced thefarther it is from the wire. This “ripple-type” energy has been detected in cropcircles (see chapter 12 [22_chapter12.html#c12]), and such a rippling effect isoften seen in ground swells (as captured on slow motion film) following thedetonation of underground nuclear tests.Did Dudley's results reveal an electromagnetic fingerprint of concentric ringsleft behind like the peaks and troughs of a frozen shockwave?Image [images/p124-02.jpg]Figure 8.13 The known electromagnetic spectrum.One thing is certain. People trampling plants do not affect the watershed or themolecular structure of plants and soil. Given such observations, let us now lookat the role played by electromagnetic radiation.ELECTROMAGNETICS AND THE ENERGY GRIDThe Universe is an expression of visible and invisible frequencies of light.When this light energy interacts with gravity the rate of spin of its moleculesslows down, the myriad frequencies express themselves as matter, and the formand the color of every organism and every object is thereby determined. Light isboth particle and wave, and it transfers its energy by means of a rapidlyalternating electromagnetic field in the form of two waves: one electrical, theother magnetic which lags a step behind. Electromagnetic waves are transverse;that is, their two components move in tandem, perpendicular to the direction oftravel. The transverse wave carries information vital to the cells of everyorganism, particularly the DNA in the human body.The number of times a wave occurs in one second along a given length (thewavelength) determines its frequency, which is also called vibration oroscillation; this frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). Consequently, one waveequals one vibration per second, or 1 Hz (1000 Hz = 1 kHz; 1 million Hz or 106Hz = 1 MHz; 1 billion Hz or 109 Hz = 1 GHz).The relevance of this to crop circles is that electromagnetic waves can causeboth interference and heating effects. While Andrews and Delgado were measuringa pair of circles at Bratton in 1987, they noticed the needle of their compassspinning anticlockwise. Since the compass lay untouched on the ground at thecenter of the circle, they could not account for this erratic behavior; ithadn't been knocked and no metal objects were near it. In fact, when the needlefinally became stationary they attempted to reproduce the effect by placing asteel tape near it, with negative results (Andrews and Delgado 1991).Years later, Professor Charles Thomas visited crop circles in Wiltshire andCornwall, armed with a sturdy, brass-cased P11 aircraft compass, the kind thatonce accurately guided bombers during World War II. His objective was to see howa magnetically sensitive instrument would react inside a crop circle.Inside the Alton Priors “Key” formation of 1991, Thomas was surprised to see adeflection in the predicted compass bearing by as much as 15° east. This acutedifference was strongest in the center of both circular areas of the pictogramand especially when the P11 was placed three feet above the ground; further, thenew bearing moved in the same direction as the lay in the flattened plants. Whenthe P11 was placed on the ground, the needle performed just as erratically, thistime flickering 5–10° west before finding north again.In the company of CCCS' Vice President George Bishop, Thomas visited a groupingof new circles in Callington, Cornwall, where he was again surprised by compassdeviations. Thomas stated, “The process of crop circle formation in these casesappears to have produced a local magnetic anomaly detectable with a reliableinstrument. One could add the comment that the anomaly appears to be linked tothe direction in which stalks are flattened and that the strength of the anomalyappears to vary with distance from ground level. There may be a suspicion thatthe magnetic field is created at the time of formation and decreases throughtime” (Thomas 1991/92).I, too, have encountered compass anomalies with varying degrees of deviation,depending on the age of the crop formation. Within the “Triple Julia Set” mycompass needle had trouble locating north, and it wobbled as if confused for atleast ten minutes before settling down.Since 1927, clues have hinted at the involvement of magnetism in crop circles,in the form of the magnetization of watches, pocket knives, and bicycles. Inrecent times, a Japanese researcher found that a battery pack with fourteenhours of available power drained instantaneously the moment it touched the floorof a new crop circle. I have loaded fresh batteries into cameras andphotographed successfully outside formations, yet the moment I cross a circleperimeter, the batteries are drained. As the BBC well knows, video equipmentsuffers from interference and performance failure. Photographic cameras fare nobetter: reports of buckled shutters, failed drives, and loss-of-power abound.Such reports can be multiplied by the hundreds.The year 2000, in particular, turned out to be an expensive one for cameraequipment. The ominous signs of trouble began inside the “lotus flower”formation below Golden Ball Hill. Any equipment with an LCD (liquid crystaldisplay) began to polarize; Paul Vigay's monitoring devices were registeringextraordinarily high frequency readings; then my camera failed.A few days later, I went to the lab to find out if my prized Nikon had made arecovery, but the technical diagnosis was not good: “Fried circuit board, veryunusual. Interesting. We have had a record number of identical problems withcameras this summer, and the strange thing is, their owners all claim theproblems happened when they took them into crop circles. I really don't believein crop circles.” Somehow he didn't seem so adamant after I'd finished tellinghim where my camera had been.In Devon, George Bishop's camera played a sort of photographic hopscotch when itrefused to work every time he stepped into a crop circle, yet operated perfectlyevery time he stepped out; a visitor to the “Tube Torus” formation had anidentical experience. They should consider themselves lucky: a professionalphotographer shooting the Littlebury 1996 formation from the air had all threecameras fail simultaneously.Mobile phones, which rely on electromagnetic frequencies to communicate withlocal towers, are also prone to crop circle energy interference. Paul Vigayfound a conversation with his father abruptly curtailed the moment he crossedthe perimeter of the Alton Priors “Key” formation. The meter on the phoneindicated that no signal was present wherever he walked in the crop circle, yetit shot up to full signal whenever he held the phone outside its perimeter. Toprove this was not a coincidence, he proceeded to walk around the entire field,up and down tram lines and across a local road. Again, only the area inside thecrop circle prevented a signal from reaching the phone. Not surprisingly, thiswas the moment the admitted skeptic dove head-first into crop circles research.It is worth pointing out that the formation was not a regular circular area buta complex dumbbell with a chiseled appendage.The size of the equipment affected seems inconsequential. When the defiantcombine harvester short-circuited as it crossed the Milk Hill “Koch fractal”little did it know what rich history it shared with other farm machineryentering crop circles. At Warminster, a tractor harvesting a field lumberedthrough a circle and had its entire electrical system fail the moment it crossedits perimeter. Farm hands were asked to push-start the machine, eventuallytowing it across the circle. Yet as the tractor emerged out the other side, itssystems jumped to life. A separate incident at Everleigh involved a tractorseized by what the farmer described as “static discharges which shone likesparks over the body of the vehicle.” The next day, a single circle appeared atthe same spot in the field.At the weirder end of the scale, farmers also report the deflating of perfectlysound, heavyduty tires inside crop circles, tires designed to outlast the lifeof the machinery. In all incidents, no sharp objects or puncture marks were everfound, nor defective valves. In Surrey, three tires belonging to two separatevehicles, using the field at different time intervals, suffered a collapse oftheir metal structures (Pringle 1999). Remember, these are no-nonsense peoplewith their hands too full running their farms to waste time on “supernaturalflim-flam.”The electromagnetic energy that may be causing these problems appears to bepresent some distance above the ground, exerting a temporary debilitating effecton aircraft engines. In the early 1980s, a helicopter pilot flew regularly overcrop circles and got so fed up with the equipment in his cockpit going haywirethat he has refused to fly over their airspace ever since.If these incidents sound expensive, they are. But a shot of retail therapy won'tmake you happier: one man had the magnetic strips on his credit cards completelywiped clean after visiting the “Nine Crescents” at Hakpen Hill (1999), while theones left “cooking” in the hot interior of his car were unaffected.One of the most unusual field tests I've come across in connection with chartingdistorted energy fields occurred in the “Triple Julia Set.” There I met two menusing digital clocks to look for discrepancies in missing time. Leaving oneclock miles away at their accommodation, they kept the second one inside theformation for twenty minutes. When they later compared both time pieces, adiscrepancy of five minutes had occurred.Several accounts exist in which time appears to have been altered, three of themassociated with the “Triple Julia Set” alone. The effect can be physicallyexperienced, and many are the times when I have walked into crop circles toperform simple tasks requiring a few minutes, only to rendezvous with mycolleagues nearby and find myself arriving hours late. Mine is not an isolatedcase, as many other researchers' furious wives will gladly tell you.Six investigators at Operation White Crow also experienced problems with timewhen, during the brief encounter with the trilling noise, an hour and a halfelapsed. In a separate incident, a crop circles watcher reported how he had beenon regular reconnaissance of a field when he realized that the shadows cast by aparticular group of trees a few yards away was at odds with the rest of thosesurrounding the field. As he walked over to check this out he discovered he hadlost half an hour. Even more puzzling was that upon walking back to his originalspot he gained back the time he lost. The following morning he returned tocontinue his surveillance and discovered a new crop circle there with threesatellites.Image [images/p127-01.jpg]Figure 8.14 The electromagnetic energy that created the crop circle appears tohave carried along the overhead electricity cables to the nearby pole anddischarged itself as a rough version of the original design. Froxfield, 1994.Image [images/p128-01.jpg]Figure 8.15 This formation, made entirely of ellipses, seemingly demonstratesknowledge of the dynamic theory of the wave-field of a magnet. Cisbury Ringshill fort, 1995.The missing time scenario was highlighted at Westbury in 1982 when Ray Barneswitnessed a crop circle forming yards away, “which took no less than fourseconds,” and noticed how the shadows around him happened to fall at the wrongangle. Meanwhile, the farmer, farther away in the field, had performed twentyminutes' worth of labor in the time it took Barnes to turn around.Missing time in crop circles might stretch credulity, or perhaps not. Theslowing down of clocks in motion is already a well-tested process in particlephysics (Capra 1986). These strange effects of time in relation to crop circlesmay prove to be a significant indicator of the process involved in theircreation, since time, to a large degree, is governed by gravity and its abilityto slow down the speeds of light. Consequently, if time is affected, thecirclemaking process could be interacting with the local electromagnetic, evengravitational, field.Could a subtle alteration of the magnetic field be taking place inside cropcircles? The effects on compasses and all manner of electronic equipment wouldsuggest so; in fact, the association between magnetism and crop circles is oneof the longest threads running through the phenomenon's history. In recent yearsthe hints have appeared in the crop circle patterns themselves: In 1995 “solarsystem” crop circles appeared along the A272 near Winchester, and below CisburyRings, a crop formation made entirely of ellipses seemingly demonstrated ourknowledge of the dynamic theory of the wavefield of a magnet. (See figures 8.15[18_chapter08.html#fig8.15] and 8.16 [18_chapter08.html#fig8.16].) But the mostenlightening for me was the “Beltane Wheel” crop glyph with its thirty-threeflames.Image [images/p128-02.jpg]Figure 8.16 Other magnetic-type crop circle designs. Avebury Trusloe, 2000; EastMeon, 1995.Beltane is the Celtic spring festival for honoring the Sun. Consequently, theflames of the Beltane Wheel often garnished Celtic and Lusitanian sundials, justas its crop circle counterpart garnished the field beside West Kennett LongBarrow three days after the Celtic festival.This is where the implications get interesting. As we know, the Sun is ourbiggest local supplier of electromagnetism, and its gravitational pull on allplanets in the solar system is formidable. Dividing the Earth's 365-day circuitaround the Sun by those thirtythree flames gives 11.060606, the convenientnumber of years in the sunspot cycle.Image [images/p129-01.jpg]Figure 8.17 Left: The process of magnetization of a ring; center: a typicalhysteresis curve; right: are these processes suggested by the “Beltane Wheel”crop glyph?Could the crop circle's flame motif be telling us something? Maybe. The shapethey make is known in physics as a hysteresis loop—a curve on a graph describinghow an object of nonmagnetic material is given magnetic field strength byincreasing or decreasing the local magnetic field. Applying this principle toplants (a nonmagnetic material), is it possible that an altered or reversedmagnetic field strength has been applied to induce them to fall? Theinterference to compasses and electronic equipment suggests so.Image [images/p129-02.jpg]Figure 8.18 “Torus Ring” crop glyph and its encoded hexagonal geometry.Esoterically, the hexagon is associated with the Sun. North Down, 2000.What's more, such a defined change in the local magnetic field can be used toeither repel or contain energy, acting like an invisible electric fence, and assuch can conceivably be used as a shielding device. This would explain whyelectrical equipment is interfered with only upon crossing the crop circle'sperimeter.There's another element that would contribute to changes in the local magneticfield—spin. Earlier I mentioned that everything in the Universe comes aboutthrough spin, and judging by the way the plants are laid, so do crop circles. Aspinning vortex is capable of generating a magnetic field, particularly so inwater, itself a conductor of electromagnetic energy. As we already know, waterplays a key role in the location of crop circles, and perhaps more importantly,it is found inside the plants' stems.Image [images/p129-03.jpg]Figure 8.19 The hidden pentagonal geometry in the “magnetic grid,” whichappeared a few miles away. The pentagon is representational of living organisms,which are, of course, affected by magnetic fields. Avebury Trusloe, 2000.Two years after the “Beltane Wheel,” more clues surfaced as to the role playedby magnetism in crop circles. The most obvious was the “Magnetic Grid” glyph atAvebury Trusloe. At this point, Colin Andrews discovered the Earth's magneticfield to have shifted locally between 3° and 5° within crop circles, a claimthat was supported within weeks by Japanese scientists.44 By way of validation,shortly after Andrews' public announcement, the Circlemakers dropped a ringtorus crop glyph two miles away, its eleven arcs twisted by 4°, giving thedesign a threedimensional feel.By now, two other crop glyphs had appeared nearby with a similar 3-D effect.Perplexed, I located all four crop circles on my map, sipped my coffee, andlooked blankly at the dots. When a flattened tetrahedron revealed itself acrossthe Avebury landscape, I followed the trail.The tetrahedron is the primary geometric structure of matter, and I recalled howin the Barbury Castle tetrahedron crop glyph each “step” of the ratchet sectionhad deviated from magnetic north—by 4 degrees.With the “magnetic grid” glyph at the center, I began to connect the dots,measuring everything relative to magnetic north (which that year layapproximately 4.5 degrees west of grid north), and discovered that the fourformations referenced each other by either 32.72 degrees or 19.47 degrees.Historically, crop circles have appeared near sacred sites, so I extended thisprocess and found that these angular relationships also exist between the cropcircles and the sacred sites, as well as between the sites themselves.Image [images/p130-01.jpg]Figure 8.20 Relationship between selected crop circles of 2000, local sacredsites, and the angles 32.72° and 19.47°.Image [images/p131-01.jpg]Figure 8.21 Four-degree shift from magnetic North. Barbury Castle tetrahedron.Let us look at the significance of these numbers: 32.7272 degrees, a circle's360° divided by 11. Now, if you take a tetrahedron (a foursided pyramid) andcircumscribe it within a sphere, such as the Earth, its points touch the sphereat 19.47°, and on planets in the solar system such as Venus, Earth, Mars, andJupiter there exists a magnetic anomaly, a point where energy upwells, and everyone of these points is located between 19° and 20° latitude—19.47° to beprecise.45Image [images/p131-02.jpg]Figure 8.22 A circumscribed tetrahedron touches the surface of the sphere at alatitude of 19.47 degrees. On Earth this energy “hotspot” is marked by theHawaiian volcanoes.Image [images/p131-03.jpg]Figure 8.23 Crop circles referencing 19.47: left, Alton Barnes 1990, and right,Golden Ball Hill, 2000.Are these angles and numerical relationships clues, exchange mechanisms betweengravity and mass, perhaps between dimensions?More to the point, is this exchange mechanism reliant on the 3–5 degreeout-of-phase rotation of the magnetic grid, as suggested in these crop circles?Clearly, the energy behind crop circles is capable of distorting the localelectromagnetic field, and interacting in strange ways with objects and people.But it's also leaving “fingerprints” on the plants.I found this out for myself in 1997 while sitting inside the Etchilhampton“Flower” crop glyph, quietly absorbed in sketching its exquisite lay. Nearby,three other enthusiasts admired the artistry (the Circlemakers', not mine).Abruptly, a crackling noise like static rose all around us; the others heard ittoo because they stopped to see where the sound was coming from. They stared atme, I stared at them. It was reminiscent of the discharge from high voltagewires, so my first reaction was to look for electricity pylons. There were none.I held my ear to the ground but it wasn't coming from the flattened crop either,nor from the standing crop at the perimeter.It was just “there,” maintaining a steady level, and surrounding us for a goodten minutes before my colleagues and I had to leave. As I crossed the perimeterof the formation, silence returned. Two years later at Roundway, I experiencedthe same crackling noise, this time in lateafternoon in a field alreadyinfiltrated by the crackling from nearby high-voltage wires, enabling me toestablish that both sounds were audibly dissimilar.Hissing sounds are not uncommon in crops, for it is the natural reaction of thedamp wheat heads expanding in the heat of the rising Sun. However, none of myexperiences have occurred early in the day. A similar incident ten years earlierat Dog-leg field, near Winchester, occurred at seven in the evening. Despite thecalm evening, a loud hissing and crackling sound was accompanied by a pulsatingbeat within the circle's perimeter.Is it possible that a type of electrical “coating” has attached itself to theplants?While studying electronics, Paul Vigay invented a small electrostatic detectorfor identifying hidden electric cables. Because it was exceptionally sensitive,the device could detect minute electrical current flows in plants and people.One day his mother came home with a batch of wheat stalks for her flowerarrangements and asked Paul to test his device on the drying stalks.Intriguingly, the probe sensed a charge in some, but registered no reaction inothers. Ushered out of the kitchen while his mother moved the stalks around, hecame back into the room to retest the batch and the results were consistent withthe first run. The test was repeated several times until his mother revealedthat those not reacting had been taken from a crop circle.Vigay decided to repeat the test in a living crop circle at Cheesefoot Head.Walking down the tram line with the device, the LED display flashed to show theplants were discharging as they should. But as Vigay crossed the perimeter ofthe formation, no readings were registered within the entire crop circle; and ashe made his exit at the opposite end of the formation the readings rose. Herepeated the test several times from different entry points and achievedidentical results. Was the lack of electric charge in the circle due to the crophaving been flattened? Apparently not. Tests inside a section of the field thathad suffered wind damage revealed readings consistent with normal plants.Questions arose when analysis of another crop circle showed no deviation fromnormal plants. To Vigay's credit, this formation had been deliberately man-madeas part of Project Argus protocol, a fact that had been kept from him at thetime. Vigay concluded that the circlemaking force appears to ground the currentwithin the perimeter of the design (Vigay 1995).Growing grain carries a neutral charge during the night, changing to positive bythe day. If the plants are being manipulated electromagnetically, it isnecessary to first apply a negative charge to allow the plants to repel thenormal magnetic field so that they point away from the center—and negativecharges have indeed been measured in plants which were inside or adjacent tocrop circles.46 Such an alteration should manifest itself in the way the plants'roots are aligned. Roots are geotropic by nature, and therefore grow downwardand toward the center of gravity. Since they are sensitive to changes in themagnetic field, any change in their alignment is a strong indication that theEarth's magnetic—possibly gravitational—field has been altered. This is the casein crop circles, where the roots are known to realign opposite the bend in thestalk, like an S-shape, contrary to their normal habit (Audus 1960).In 1993, tests using a standard electrostatic voltmeter also revealed that thestanding crop inside a formation was “coated” with a charge ranging from 10–20volts per inch. By 1999, this charge had risen, some crop circles registering 30volts, and in one case in excess of 100 volts (Hein 2000).There is no doubt that electromagnetic energy occurs in crop circles, and incertain cases it can pack a punch. In the village of Spaldwick, Cambridgeshire,alarms went off at 2 A.M. due to a sudden power surge shortly before thediscovery nearby of a large “Celtic cross” crop circle. But these villagers hadnothing to complain about, after all, the 1991 Barbury Castle tetrahedron tookout an entire town's electricity, plus that of twenty square miles ofsurrounding countryside, and the “Beltane Wheel” formation even silenced localradio. These power surges remain unexplained by utility companies, and theindication is that not only are we dealing with a considerable generation ofpower, but the higher the design complexity involved in the crop circle—thesquare footage affected—the stronger the discharge.BIOPHYSICAL CHANGESIf an artificial or electromagnetic energy source is interacting with thenatural cycle of plants, it is natural to assume that the effect is verifiableat the microscopic level.In 1988, Andrews and Delgado sent plant samples from crop circles, together withcontrols, to Signalysis Laboratory in Stroud, England. The samples wereprocessed by Kenneth and Rosemary Spelman in accordance with a procedureapproved in the German government's “Pharmacopoeia for Homeopathy” for spagyricpreparations. This process is normally used in the diagnosis of human bloodsamples, since it allows for the crystalline structure of minerals dissolved influids to be examined under a microscope.Image [images/p134-01.jpg]Figure 8.24 Crystalline energy patterns: control sample.Image [images/p134-02.jpg]Figure 8.25 Center of crop circle.Their results revealed how the irregular pattern in control samples had taken ona structured pattern inside crop circles and that energy of some type hadchanged the plants' crystalline structure (Andrews and Delgado 1990). A separatebarrage of tests on samples, this time taken from a crop circle in Argonne,Illinois, by molecular biologist Kevin Folta, even showed that the DNA wasconsiderably different from the controls (Chorost and Dudley 1992a).After the Spelmans' tantalizing report was published, Delgado was contacted byanother interested party, Dr. W. C. Levengood from Michigan, who hoped to followup on the UK experiments. A respected biophysicist, over the course of hismulti-disciplinary career Dr. Levengood has conducted investigations into suchareas as the effects of solar and cosmic rays on the reproduction of livingorganisms and the relationship between ion transport and vigor selection inseeds. He holds six patents and has written fifty peer-reviewed papers.Levengood's curiosity led him to investigate the possibility of molecularchanges in crop circle plants. After performing thousands of hours of field workand laboratory studies on hundreds of crop circles, as well as controlled,man-made scientific experiments and tests on control samples, he detected aseries of statistically significant anomalies.One of the first puzzles Levengood came across concerned the seeds. Seed headscollected from crop circles contained seeds that were often severely stunted,malformed, and lower in weight and/or reduced in size. Levengood attributed thisto a premature dehydration of the seeds, their development arrested at the timethe crop circle was created.47 The critical time for such alterations appears tooccur early on in the seed's development, the effect becoming less visiblerelative to the seeds' maturity; when mature, an increase in seed growth occurs.To see how the seeds reacted when germinated, Levengood conducted closelymonitored fourteen-day laboratory trials to compare their growth cycle withcontrols. He noted that the crop circle seeds reacted variably, depending uponthe presumed intensity of the circle-making energy as well as the age of theplants when affected.The results show an inconsistency with natural plant development. In some of theimmature plants, the seeds failed to germinate; in young plants, they didgerminate but with grossly depressed development in roots and shoots. Plantsaffected in the late life cycle by crop circle energy developed in a mannerinconsistent with seeds of that species, revealing accelerated germination andincreased vigor in the more mature plants; the latter exhibited a growth rate 40percent faster than normal and had a healthier root structure.Image [images/p135-01.jpg]Figure 8.26 A blown node. The small hole has been created by pressurized,superheated water forcing its way out of the stem. Note the charring effect.What kind of energy is capable of altering a plant's natural life and growthcycles? To find out, Levengood tested a sample of plants in a commercialmicrowave oven. The results revealed that the closest similarities to cropcircle samples—even at the microscopic level—occurred when the plants weresubjected to thirty seconds of microwave exposure, not too far off from therange of circle-making time described by eyewitnesses. Evidence of this rapidheating was corroborated by a superficial charring of the plant tissue whichleft deeper layers unaffected, thereby indicating the brevity of the action.In his first peer-reviewed paper on crop circles, Dr. Levengood stated that “theaffected plants have components which suggest the involvement of rapid airmovement, ionization, electric fields, and transient high temperatures combinedwith an oxidizing atmosphere. One naturally occurring and organized forceincorporating each of these features is an ion plasma vortex, one very highenergy example being a lightning charge” (Levengood 1994).Another conundrum concerned the plant's nodes. These fibrous protuberances arethe hardest portions of the stem, allowing a plant to support its weight andmaintain its upright posture. Levengood found the nodes in crop circle plants tobe grossly enlarged and expanded, much more than could be accounted for bytrauma, exposure to chemicals, or pest infestation. Phototropism andgravitropism both play a role in the bending of nodes, yet these naturalprocesses take time to develop and cannot account for the massive node-bendingobserved in new crop circles. The slight node length extensions observed inman-made formations proved statistically insignificant.By far the most important discovery in Levengood's research pertained to thenodes' bract tissue, the thin membrane supporting the seed head that enablesnutrients to be supplied to the developing embryos. Levengood found an abnormalenlargement of the tissues' cell-wall pits; these are the minuscule holes thatallow the movement of nutrients. Here, he discovered a series of expulsioncavities or “blow holes,” as if internal liquid had been forced out from insidethe plants. Again, this is not found in normal crops under any knowncircumstances.In striking contrast to the control samples, the elongated scars show how arapid expansion took place inside crop circle plants, the result of the water inthe cell walls being suddenly heated. With nowhere to escape, the water forcesits way outwards by exploiting the weaker sections of the tissue, therebycreating the scars.Levengood concluded that “the energy mechanism producing quantitativealterations in the plant stem nodes falls within the framework of astraight-forward and widely applied principal of physics [Beer's Law] dealingwith the absorption of electromagnetic energy by matter,” strongly suggestingthat an energy source “originating in the microwave region” had boiled the waterinside the plants' nodes, effectively transforming it into steam (ibid.).Michael Chorost reached similar conclusions in his published report for ProjectArgus. He found the circle-making phenomenon induces radiation anomalies, heatsplants rapidly and briefly through a rapid pulse of unknown energy, sometimesscorching them; and that it swells their cell wall pits, interacts with thedevelopment of the seeds, and leaves radioactive traces in the soil (Chorost andDudley 1992a).But if microwaves are the answer, certain things need to be taken intoconsideration. Microwaves are an electromagnetic energy wave with a frequencyabove 1 GHz (109 Hz). Microwave energy quickly dissipates after initial contactwith an object, yet sensors capable of detecting electromagnetic frequenciesshow that an energy residue remains in the crop circles long after itsappearance, sometimes for years.Moreover, the side effects of microwaves are generally inconsistent with theparticulars of crop circles. Recent studies into microwaves and cellular phonesshow how detrimental these frequencies can be to the human body (Whitlock 1999),just as Marconi once discovered in his early experiments, much to his horror,how these frequencies killed animals close to the source. Such detrimental, evenfatal, side effects on humans or animals is unheard of with crop circles.Microwaves are also capable of rendering both soil and plants sterile, and incrop circles this is a rare exception.48 So, it is likely that the energy behindcrop circles lies elsewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum, and it may not bethe only type of energy involved.If you cast your mind back to the early history of crop circles, Terence Meadenproposed that stationary whirlwinds and plasma vortices were somehow responsiblefor making crop circles. While the weather-based theory has proved to beimplausible, Japanese scientists have demonstrated in laboratory conditions howplasma (essentially a superheated, ionized gas) is capable of organizing itselfinto simple concentric shapes, with alternating layers of positive/negativecharge, reminiscent of the shapes and directional plant lay of early cropcircles and rings.One could argue, then, that the energy behind crop circles is natural, and thatan intelligent source is able to control it to a very fine degree. How else canwe explain a “natural phenomenon” that selectively avoids houses, towns,gardens, and parks? That produces hundreds of geometrical and philosophicallysignificant shapes of great complexity? That interacts with, even reads theminds of, its human observers?Over the past few decades, Japanese scientists have been investigating howphysical manifestation is based on energy spun from the vacuum energy field ofspace. In his book Paradigm of New Science—Principia for the Twenty-FirstCentury, the Japanese scientist Dr. Shiuji Inomata proposes that the vacuumstate is an energy field in which consciousness is integrated withelectromagnetic and gravitational forces to create matter. His theoretical modelillustrates how energy transmutations, such as the manifestation anddemanifestation of matter, might be capable of taking place according to suchprinciples.49Spinning this energy from one state into another appears to be correlated to theGolden Mean spiral, the spiral of nature; hydrogen, too, seems to be involved inthis process, a particularly important point since it is fundamental to water,and both water and spirals are fundamental to crop circles.This energy's residual effects also appear to support Delgado's earlyspeculation: That crop circles are created in two stages, the first priming eachstem so it is programmed to move in a predetermined direction, the secondactivating it to fall to its intended position (Andrews and Delgado 1991).In which case we shouldn't just be looking down at the ground, but also up atthe sky.THE AERIAL COMPONENTJack Spooncer spent thirty successful years in the aerospace industry designingengines for Rolls Royce and Westland, during which time he developed anenquiring mind and a working knowledge of polymers. He is also trusted enough tohold NATO security clearance.One night during the hot summer of 1997 he was driving back to his farmhouse,sited above an aquifer of unusually high pressure and in a part of Dorset richin Neolithic sites. As he turned the corner towards his property he came upon anincredible sight: “A large dome of light, about two hundred feet in diameter,was touching the corn field. There were thousands of points of light, likediamonds, all aligned and geometric. It was glistening, shimmering like ahologram.” He heard a high-pitched sound permeating the surrounding area, butjust as the headlights from his car shone through the translucent bubble, itdisappeared.50Early next morning, two well-defined half rings of flattened crop appeared,their “stems perfectly brushed, crunching underfoot.” Jack reasoned that had hiscar not interrupted the work-in-progress, a more complex pattern may havemanifested; Jack also speculated that a high degree of magnetic flux may haveaccounted for suspending the droplets of water in regular patterns.51 Naturalforces at work? Or did Jack catch the Circlemakers at work?Catching the Circlemakers at it was the last thing on my mind as I sat oneafternoon on top of a hill while having a picnic with friends. I was compelledto pick up my camera and photograph what seemed an ordinary shot across the Valeof Pewsey. The sky was overcast and shadows faint—hardly a captivating image.Two days later a heptagonal crop formation appeared beside Tawsmead Copse at thesame general location as my photo.Later I received accounts from two people who had independently seen a “tube oflight” descend into that field, one at 5 A.M. prior to the appearance of theformation, the other two days earlier in mid-afternoon, around the time of mypicnic. When I took a look at the photograph it showed two rays of sunlightbeaming through the clouds (see figure 8.27 on page A8 in the color section). Asa seasoned photographer, it occurred to me that rays of sunlight can only beshot when one is facing the Sun, and at the time the photo was taken, facingeast, the Sun was already in the west. Further, shafts of sunlight tend toexpand in width the closer they come to the horizon, but the edges of mine wereperpendicular.Laboratory analysis confirmed that light had not fogged the film, for the raysdid not run the width of the entire negative, but started inside the exposedimage of the vale and stopped at the horizon. What is even more remarkable isthat I don't recall seeing these beams at the time I took the photo. This is byno means the first time these tubes of light have been photographed. A couplevisiting a formation at Alton Priors in 1991 took five photographs of whatlooked like a column of white cloud accompanied by small white lights directlyabove the dumbbell crop circle (Pringle 1999).Evidence suggests that not only do these tubes precede crop circles, but that onsome occasions they are directly involved with the process. Over the course ofour conversations, Nancy Talbott had often expressed to me her frustration atnot being able to see a direct manifestation of a crop circle and the agencybehind it. Given that Nancy is a grounded, matter-of-fact individual, thiswasn't surprising. In August 2001, she traveled to Holland to helpparapsychologist Dr. William Roll gather geomagnetic and electromagnetic data.Roll was himself interested as to whether an element of human consciousness wasinvolved in the crop circles. Their hosts, the van der Broekes, had had cropcircles appear outside their home, and their son Robbert had not only hadpremonitions of some of these, he'd also photographed unusually bright lightsand orbs inside them.Around 3 A.M. on August 21, when Robbert and Nancy were looking out across thebean field to the rear of the house from separate rooms, they heard the localcattle “bawling raucously,” accompanied by the neighbor's dog. Then fifteenminutes later “a brilliant, intense white column, or tube, of light—about 8inches to 1 foot in diameter, from my vantage point—flashed down from the sky tothe ground, illuminating my bedroom and the sky as brilliantly as if fromhelicopter searchlights. My room was so bright I can't, in retrospect,understand how I could so very clearly see the ‘tube’ of light outside—itsdistinct edges—but I could, for about a full second, and there seemed to be aslight bluish tinge along the sides of the tube.”Two more tubes of light would be seen in a space of six seconds before the tworan out to the field and found an elliptical crop circle with an appendageresembling the letter “T.” A veil of steam rose faintly out of the ground.Robbert described the tubes as spiraling, and maintaining the same width fromthe sky all the way down to the ground.52Talbott and van der Broeke's recent eyewitness account is one of many such closeencounters. In 1966, not far from the majestic white chalk cliffs of Dover, aman walking in the rain saw what he described as “a translucent glass tube”descend from the sky. With the rain visibly deflecting off its surface and thenearby livestock “seemingly transfixed” by loud hissing sounds, the tube sealedoff an area of grass and created a crop circle (T. Wilson 1998).On the afternoon of August 24, 1990, a farmer tending his field of winter barleybehind Golden Ball Hill suddenly found himself in a similar situation, standingten feet away from a three-footthick rotating, perpendicular tube whoseearth-bound end stopped short of the ground, while the other end rosestratospherically to a point out of view. The tube remained stationary as aswirling motion manifested in his crop.The idea of a controlled energy employed within a tube—something like a laser—tocreate a crop circle is supported by Ray Barnes. He once witnessed a “line”descending into the crop, then moving across the field to become stationary,whereupon it sank down and rotated, generating a flattened swirl in four seconds(ibid.). These tubes appear to retain some form of residual energy. Aneyewitness in Westbury describes seeing smoke from nearby fires blow across afield and reach a crop circle only to hit an “invisible wall” and skirt thedesign; above the crop circle, a vapor trail from an airplane at 25,000 feet wasseen breaking apart as it crossed this tube (Pringle 1999).Apparently, a mass of energy is projected in a self-contained stream from apoint high above the Earth. For energy or liquid to travel inside a tube, aspiraling, rotating motion is required for effective movement to take place; theclosest examples of this method are the way blood circulates through veins orwater goes down a plug hole.53 The Russian metaphysician P. D. Ouspenskydescribes this process in terms of light: “The electron is transformed intoquanta; it becomes a ray of light. The point is transformed into a line, into aspiral, into a hollow cylinder” (Ouspensky 1931). The philosopher describes thismodel of a ray of light consisting of particles lying close to one anotherlengthwise “with two kinds of thread.” Perhaps this is the electromagnetictransverse wave, the combination of electric and magnetic waves, one laggingslightly behind the other.Regardless of what we call the energy inside these tubes, it seems to send a“code” which tells the plants what to do and when. However, the process leaves aunique fingerprint in the design. Normally, when you shine a flashlight againsta surface at a distance, the result isn't a circle of light, but an ellipse,particularly if the flashlight is not perpendicular to the surface. In the caseof a light beam projected from high above the Earth, the initially circularprojection has to contend with the Earth's curvature, the progressively denseratmospheric layers which act as lenses, and the gradient of the ground.Consequently, crop circles appear slightly elliptical. The “distortion” variesfrom the circular from as little as eight inches to as much as fifteen feet, theeffect being more pronounced when the circles appear on the sides of hills.54The elliptical shape of crop circles may support the possibility that they areeither created or activated by a beam. Such a beam must be capable of passingthrough clouds and rain with little attenuation or loss of energy, and withinthe confines of our present technology, an electromagnetic frequency around themicrowave spectrum would achieve just that.As the evidence shows, the tubes of light originate from a point beyond therange of our vision. But, on occasion, they have been known to be attached tosomething.On the night of July 13, 1988, around 11:30 P.M., Mary Freeman was driving southnext to the Avebury stone avenue. She noticed how the underside of a cloud nearSilbury Hill had a golden white glow and was a great deal brighter than the glowfrom the Moon, which was not full. The hazy shape of an oval object seemed toprotrude from inside the cloud. Suddenly, a tubular beam, as wide as a footballfield, plunged out of the cloud towards the ground to the south of Silbury.Freeman changed her direction of travel and raced towards the beam, whichremained in place for some three minutes.She remembered this incident clearly because all the objects in her car suddenlylevitated around her as if the vehicle had been caught up in an energy field.Within thirty-six hours, farmer Roger Hues discovered the first of the five“Celtic Cross” formations at the base of Silbury Hill.Three years later, a young man out riding his bike in Butleigh, Somerset, hearda high-pitched humming sound. As he looked up he saw a stationary, silver,bell-shaped craft project a spiraling vortex of “aura-like” light into a fieldand make a twenty-nine-foot crop circle in the early wheat, which in April wasbarely a foot high. The event was over in a few seconds and occurred in broaddaylight (Wingfield 1991b).A similar experience occurred above the East Field, this time at midnight.Intrigued by a similar buzzing sound, a couple living nearby walked outsidetheir house to find a set of colored lights swirling in the pitch-black sky.Twenty minutes later the lights congealed into one object from which a beam ofwhite light descended onto the field. Five hours later the “DNA” crop glyph wasdiscovered.Given such clear incidences involving aerial phenomena popularly know asunidentified flying objects, we are faced with postulating that an outsidesource is the agency responsible for interrupting the seasonal flow of cerealcrops. But, too, isn't it ridiculous to make “space brothers” the likelyculprits?Enough material has been written on UFOs to stock a generous-sized aircrafthangar, and I shall provide an overview of this equally misunderstood area ofknowledge. If you are inclined to pursue it further, T. J. Constable's TheCosmic Pulse of Life provides an excellent grounding in the subject, as doesJohannes von Buttlar's seminal work The UFO Phenomenon, featuring scores ofreliable and close-up reports from civil and air force pilots. There areaccounts of daylight encounters, planes crashing, pilots killed in pursuit ofUFOs, and statements from air traffic controllers, statesmen, and evenastronauts.As with crop circles, human contact with UFOs predates the twentieth century; infact, it is recorded in the Ramayana, one of the sacred Indian sagas, dating to6000 B.C. Here you will find written accounts of “two-storied celestial chariotswith many windows, roaring like lions and blazing with red flames as they ascendinto the sky to fly like comets”; the Mahabharata and other Vedic and Sanskrittexts describe similar events. In shamanic cultures throughout southern Africa,UFOs are referred to as abahambi abavutayo, the “fiery chariots” (Dutt 1961;Gordon 1962).A papyrus stored in the Vatican tells of a UFO sighting in Egypt during thereign of Tuthmosis III in 1500 B.C. The object is described as emitting a “foulodour,” an observation often reported by latter-day victims of close encounters.In the Chronicle of William of Newburgh, 1290, it is written that the abbot ofByland Abbey in Yorkshire was about to say grace when, “John, one of thebrethren came in and said there was a great portent outside. Then they all ranout and Lo! a large round silver object, not dissimilar to a disc, flew slowlyover them and excited the greatest terror”; a similar report of the periodexists in Matthew of Paris' Historia Anglorum.Despite persistent and often contradictory denials by members of today'smilitary, the subject of UFOs has been active within the ranks of air forcesaround the world since the 1940s. As General Benjamin Chidlaw, USAF Commander ofContinental Air Defense, once remarked: “We have stacks of reports of flyingsaucers. We take them very seriously when you consider we have lost many men andplanes trying to intercept them” (Stringfield 1957, Good 1987).This would explain why a sizable document on public safety such as the U.S. FireOfficer's Guide to Disaster Control Manual, Second Edition, devotes thirteenpages to UFOs, and preparedness in the event of a crash or attack. On the otherhand, the existence of a U.S. government agency researching UFOs is purportedlyclassified “above top secret,” denying access even to the president, and federallaw empowers NASA's administrator to impound, without a hearing, anyone whotouches a UFO or its occupants. Sobering advice indeed.Once in a blue moon, however, the authorities give the public a taste of whatthey must surely know. During an American television documentary in 1960, thePentagon accepted UFOs as intelligently guided machines whose technology couldnot be accounted for on Earth. Lord Dowding, England's Air Chief Marshall,stated: “The existence of these machines is proved.” There exists a substantiallist of UFO sightings made by NASA astronauts: One account from the crew ofApollo XII states that a UFO followed them all the way from Earth orbit towithin 130,000 miles of the moon (Hynek and Valleé 1975). Would this perhapsexplain why IBM sold the U.S. Air Force's Space Surveillance Team asupercomputer in 2000 “to better detect and identify unidentified flying objectsin Earth's orbit” (Reuters 2000)?According to David Ash and Peter Hewitt, “The real problem with UFOs is not ashortage of evidence, but rather the absence of any scientific explanation fortheir existence and behavior. It is difficult if not impossible to accommodateUFOs in existing scientific thinking” (Ash and Hewitt 1990). The astrophysicistDr. Jacques Valleé also concludes that just because UFOs violate the laws ofmotion, as we presently know them, does not nullify their existence (Valleé1975).Senior citizens, children, policemen, even military personnel have reportedlarge structured craft six to thirty-six hours before the appearance of cropcircles. Farmers around the Barbury Castle area have witnessed military jets andhelicopters scramble to intercept balls of light or silent flying objects whichthen proceed to toy with their chasers, sometimes blinking out and re-appearingbehind the craft giving chase. Busty Taylor has witnessed so many rotatingobjects with blinking lights that during his time as a driving instructor he'sused these sightings as a reliable test of his students' alertness at the wheel.That these objects are not the lurid imagination of quirky British country-folkis confirmed by identical reports from around the world, including eyewitnessesfrom rural areas of Romania, Hungary, and Russia, countries where the words“crop” and “circle” had, up to that point, never been associated.Former Yorkshire police sergeant Anthony Dodd has written extensively about theconnection between the increase in UFO activity prior to crop circle activity.In 1991, members of his UFO organization investigated an incident on June 29 inBristol, England, when dozens of witnesses called the police shortly beforemidnight to report a large red object crossing the night sky above the city.After it descended into nearby fields, a helicopter appeared and began to givechase. When the craft shot away at high speed, the helicopter returned to thefield, combing it with its powerful searchlight. The next morning, residentsdiscovered a large dumbbell pictogram at the site (Dodd 1991).The presumed circle-making craft are not necessarily large. With the increase inthe number of visitors to crop circle sites since the 1990s, the number ofeyewitnesses reporting small silver-colored spheres has steadily grown, one ofthe best examples being Steven Alexander's daytime footage of the blinkingsphere below Milk Hill, the event witnessed at close quarters on the ground by afarm laborer (see chapter 1 [10_chapter01.html#c1]).The objects appear capable of traveling at high speed; they are noiseless inflight, but emit a loud hum when hovering in position above a field. They varyin size from tennis to beach ball, and are capable of maneuvering at sharpangles with dexterity and as the British military has experienced over AltonPriors, they can toy with helicopters at will. They are most often seen at nightbetween the hours of 11 P.M. and 3 A.M., as colored balls of either exceptionalluminescence or translucence.One morning, as she poured my first cup of coffee, my bed-and-breakfast host,Marigold Pearce, told me of an experience that “may or may not be relevant toyour research.” Returning home at 2 A.M. from her night shift as a nurse, shewas driving along the dark Vale of Pewsey when she saw “an exceptionally brightorange headlight” following her car at high speed. Believing it to be amotorcycle in a hurry, Mrs. Pearce gave the speeder passing room. But as it shotpast her car, she was amazed to find it was a small, incandescent, unmannedsphere. It hovered along the road for a short distance before making a lazycurve over the hedge and across the fields. Apparently the local people are soused to these balls of light they do not pay them much attention any more, andPearce was no different.Paul Vigay had a similar experience shortly before the appearance of the “DNA”crop circle. As he neared a bend in the road above the East Field, a brightlight raced around the corner at approximately sixty mph. Believing it to be thelight from an approaching motorcycle (although it was far too close to theground for that), and worried about the dangerous speed for such a narrow road,Paul stopped his car. He expected the oncoming vehicle to drive by, but instead,it changed direction and flew over his car. Vigay's car engine cut outimmediately. Behind the ball, a van was bombing downhill in hot pursuit, buthaving trouble keeping up with the sphere. The object then left the road and wastracked for five minutes by four separate surveillance groups interspersed alongthe ridges above the Vale of Pewsey.Jane Ross had witnessed some of these balls of light prior to the summer of1997, so she made a request for them to “manifest” to a group of people by wayof validation that she wasn't losing her marbles. Following a healing ceremonyinside the “Bourton Star” crop formation in July, seven of these objectsobliged, and were seen dancing silently above the neighboring field at EastonHill and its resident long barrow. They flickered in a nonlinear fashion; theywere too low for stars, too silent for aircraft, too tall for flashlights ortractor headlights, and too abrupt for weather balloons or military flares. Theyglowed with light of unusual brightness in green, orange, red, and purpleshades. They were observed (and videotaped) to move around casually for fifteenminutes before switching off, leaving the kind of afterglow one sees withhalogen bulbs. Two other witnesses were present; I was one of them.Balls of light like these have been filmed by Japanese film crews stationed atAdam's Grave long barrow in Wiltshire, some just a couple of hours prior to acrop circle forming in the fields (figure 8.29 on page A8 in the color section).Much daylight footage has also been shot by the public. One notable incident,this time from a camera mounted on the earthen rim of Barbury Castle, showed anumber of these small incandescent guests wandering in and out of the “Dolphins”crop circle below. And on one of my many ultralight flights, my pilot and I wereovertaken by a silver sphere, which changed to red as it glided past us 200 feetaway. The incident took place near Golden Ball Hill which was perhaps named dueto its association with such phenomena.Putting together all these reports of flying objects, a pattern begins toemerge, and a confusing one at that. Large structured craft; small, silver, andseemingly physical spheres; small, luminous, and seemingly physical spheres;balls of light that run the gamut of the visible color spectrum—how can they beall these things?This following example provides a clue to the nature of these so-called UFOs.While investigating a series of crop circles in Cornwall, CCCS' chairman GeorgeBishop took photographs which later revealed a green globe and a strange redobject; other images were pockmarked with translucent white globes. Bishop wasadamant that these “balls of light” had not been visible at the time the imageswere shot. It was believed that a defect in the film processing had taken place(later proved not to be the case), until identical light phenomena appeared inother visitors' photos, nine in all, some even shot at night.55Hundreds of examples of light phenomena have since been captured on film, andnot just inside crop circles, but in stone circles, too (see figure 8.28 on pageA8 in color section).56 With the exception of people of psychic ability, the“balls of light” are never visible to the naked eye at the time the photos aretaken, suggesting they are forms of energy at various stages of manifestation.Science has established that the physical world is made up of atoms spinning atvery high rates. In questioning the nature of the Universe, many physicists andmetaphysicians have developed an understanding that different rates of spingovern different states of matter, even consciousness. As such, UFOs, balls oflight, and other “paranormal” phenomena are inhabitants of a reality governed byrates of spin (some call it vibration) that differ from ours. Hence they are asreal on their plane of existence as we are on ours. To illustrate this point,our visual cortex is capable of seeing a tree as long as the atoms that make upthe tree vibrate at the same frequency as the human eye and its informationprocessing mechanism. If the tree's atoms were to vibrate at a rate 2 Hz belowthe frequency of the eye, the tree would either “disappear” or the eye wouldregister the tree as a “ghost.”When objects from other levels of reality alter their rate of spin they areobserved as increasingly physical phenomena in our dimension. Additionally, astheir frequency moves along the electromagnetic spectrum we see these objects indifferent colors, as author and UFO researcher John Keel observed: “When theobjects begin to move into our spatial and time coordinates, they gear down fromhigher frequencies, passing progressively from ultraviolet to bluish green. Whenthey stabilize within our dimension, they radiate energy on all frequencies andbecome a glaring white” (Keel 1975).This ability to transubstantiate matter would require, among other things, anunderstanding of the illusion of time, the function of gravity, knowledge of theproposed three speeds of light, and the spinning vortex action of molecules(Myers and Percy 1999), techniques attributed in the past to mortals such asJesus Christ, the prophet Mohammed, and the Greek philosopher Apollonius ofTyana (Ash and Hewitt 1990; Yogananda 1996).Studies into bioplasmic energy fields and orgone energy by such notables asRudolf Steiner, Wilhelm Reich, and Semison and Valentina Kirlian clearly showthat we are surrounded by a life-force energy which is interactive, yetseemingly invisible to the limited human range of vision. Mechanistic thoughthas brainwashed us into believing this energy source does not exist but, onoccasion, the etheric world does show itself. An aura, several inches thick, waswitnessed around the Tibetan Grand Lama by Dr. Alexander Cannon, a distinguishedscientist and celebrated psychiatrist of his day (Hall 1937). This same aura isgraphically represented by the ed by the halo framing the heads of Jesus Christand the Christian saints.57That this force is associated with consciousness was hinted by the NobelPrize-winning father of quantum theory, Max Planck: “There is no matter as such!All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force. We must assumebehind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mindis the matrix of all matter.”It appears that a number of sources contribute to the creation of crop circles.Given that these forms can react to the thoughts of people in their vicinity,these forms are either conscious, or at the very least, intelligently directed.Regardless, the increasing sighting and filming of “structured” craft, balls oflight, even tubes of light that seem to originate from beyond Earth'satmosphere, all support the hypothesis that an aerial-borne outside agency isinvolved.Even so, we can rule out crop circles as landings by alien craft. Classic UFOaccounts, such as the Australian “UFO nests,” are generally associated withsquashed plants, indentations, electronic disruption, paralysis, burns, andharmful radioactivity. For example, in 1954, a number of people saw a craftflatten a field of corn in Mexico; that circular area yielded no further plantgrowth after the incident (Randles and Fuller 1990). A Uruguayan farmerwitnessed a rotating, glowing orange ball flatten grass into a circle, scorchingit in the process; this incident caused electrical failure and the subsequentdeath of his dog.Given the ground evidence of crop circles, such reports suggest thatcirclemaking and landing UFOs are two separate phenomena, albeit sharing someattributes (electronic disruption, for example). Whatever your stance on UFOs,the cumulative evidence that someone not entirely of terrestrial origin isassociated with a significant number of crop circle events is beyond doubt, evenif less than 20 percent of crop circles are preceded by a UFO or otherintelligently behaving light phenomena.In which case, who or what makes up the remainder of this intelligence?41The calculation was made by Paul Vigay.42Incidentally, the Pyramids of Gizeh were constructed using a colossal volumeof limestone blocks. The properties of these pyramids are known to generateelectromagnetic and acoustic anomalies, so a connection may yet exist betweenpyramid makers and Circlemakers.43The department in this government-run laboratory responsible for the tests wasshut down immediately after the test results were announced, under the excuse of“waste of government resources,” even though the project was entirely funded bythe CCCS. For complete details, see Thomas 1992.44Personal communication with Colin Andrews.45Whenever a tetrahedron is circumscribed by a sphere, the ratio between thesurfaces of these geometric solids is 2.72, a transdimensional constant. 2.72 isthe convenient number for the Megalithic Yard, the unit of measure used by thearchitects of stone circles and other sacred sites, including the temples ofancient Egypt. 2.72 is also the number of transformation. The number 32.72 isassociated with the Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, 32.7 inchesbeing one of the critical measurements found in this corbelled chamber.Converted to frequency it becomes 415 Hz, the note A-flat. Coincidentally, 32 Hzis also the fundamental frequency of the harmonic music scale (see Hero 1992).46From tests carried out by John Burke of BLT Research, Cambridge, MA.47Speeded germination of seeds is associated with a plant's orientation to amagnetic pole or the introduction of an artificial magnetic field duringgermination. In fact, planting seeds aligned to the north is a centuries-oldritual in rural folklore.48If you will recall, this has only been observed twice (by Marcus Allen andmyself), once at Avebury, once at Barbury Castle crop glyphs (1999). With regardto dead animals, the flattened Canadian porcupine incident is perhaps theexception. However, in chapter 11 [21_chapter11.html#c11] the same effect isattributed to sound.49Published in 1987 in Japanese, and referenced in John Davidson's The Secret ofthe Creative Vacuum: Man and the Energy Dance.50Spooncer's “glistening bubble” is remarkably similar to eyewitness reportsduring the second appearance at Fatima by the Virgin Mary in September 1917.51Personal conversation with Jack Spooncer.52From an interview with Jeff Rense, on the Jeff Rense Radio Show, November 19,2001.53Daily Telegraph, 1998, op. cit.; and Dr. A.

This energy field or aura is referenced in at leastninety-seven different cultures."},{"pageContent":"9. THE LANGUAGE OF LIGHTThe man who speaks with primordial images speaks with a thousand tongues.—Carl JungIt is said that one mark of an advanced civilization lies in its ability tocommunicate vast amounts of information by encoding it in the shortest possiblespace, such as in an abstract symbol. Small wonder, then, that a symbol canstimulate us consciously, interact with us subconsciously, and affect ouremotions with greater speed and at a much deeper level than language. Forexample, a mandala can create inner peace just as the reversed swastika, as lastemployed by Hitler, can mobilize people for war.Recognizing the function of symbol, its importance, and its use by advancedcivilizations is fundamental to understanding why the Circlemakers choose tocommunicate with designs that not only seem cross-cultural, but referenceknowledge which today is considered esoteric. It also allows us to interprettheir rich vocabulary and extract whatever information is encoded within it.This deciphering exercise may seem intellectual at first, yet since the ultimateeffect of a symbol is to awaken the senses, the language of crop circlesultimately speaks to the heart.Image [images/p146-01.jpg]Figure 9.1 Early crop circles can be identified with petroglyphs from around theworld.Early civilizations chose to communicate by using an iconography based onnatural and Universal principles. Much of their symbolic language survivesthroughout the world in the form of rock carvings, pottery design, andsometimes, whole temples of veneration. Perhaps our most famous symbols are theEgyptian hieroglyphs, created by a culture that understood the connectionbetween material life and etheric nature. Combining literal meaning and pun,their hieroglyphs communicate much more than a pharaoh's exploits. As metaphorsof the world above and the world below, they were also used to raise the levelof a person's awareness. This was achieved by encoding the glyphs with a codethat unlocked information buried in the subconscious, where the “owner's manual”lies permanently stored yet remains largely inaccessible to the left-brainpersonality.Symbol is related to that other primordial vehicle, myth. Myth stems from mutus,meaning mute, silent, signifying those things which are inexplicable to thephysical world unless explained through a “verbal” symbol. As such, myth relatesa sacred and truthful story from outside the boundaries of temporal space,revealing a cosmological reality in a way no other method can (Benoist 1975). Assuch, myths are stories explaining phenomena of nature, the origins of humans,and the exploits of gods. They provide a Universal work of literature thatserves as a foundation for correct conduct in life, and whose sharedcommonalties herald from a common source: a fountain of knowledge whosearchetypes were, and continue to be, accessible to all.58Therefore, symbols preserve information for thousands of years, unadulterated bythe tides of time or whimsical changes in custom, religion, and politics. Andbecause their fundamental message remains unadulterated, symbols serve asmnemonic devices that help us remember.Like our distant ancestors, indigenous cultures that share similar symbols andmyths recognize crop circles as receptacles of Divine truth. They see cropcircles as the vessels of communication between two worlds. An account by CredoMutwa, a traditional healer who saw thirty crop circles during his travelsthroughout South Africa, illustrates this point:Over the centuries, people had discovered that the star gods sometimescommunicated with human beings through these sacred fields. Time and again,strange circular depressions were seen in the centre of these fields. Thesedepressions were called izishoze zamatongo, the great circles of the gods. . . .The stalks of corn or millet are never cut by the gods when they form thesedepressions. It appears as though a great circular disk-shaped force hasdescended on the field. It presses the corn firmly into the ground, withoutbreaking the stalks or damaging the plants. Then the force appears to spin,resulting in the strange spiral appearance of the fallen stalks (Mutwa 1996).Like Egypt's hieroglyphs, today's crop glyphs are cryptic and generally requirean understanding of the meaning concealed beneath the first outward layer ofexpression. They are multilayered, ambiguous, metaphorical, instructional, eveninspirational, containing myths not so much to be read but absorbedsubconsciously. And because they are abstract, they present a challenge not justto our linear style of thinking but to our desire for immediate gratification.Image [images/p148-01.jpg]Figure 9.2 The trident motif of four crop glyphs of 1990 (Allington Down shownabove) is often carved on Neolithic stone chambers and other sacred spacesassociated with transformation.The evolution of crop glyphs unveils like the plot in a mystery play, and weparticipate not as spectators but as players, offered clues that build fromscene to scene. Subtly the story emerges, inevitably gelling into a mysticalwhole. This smooth unfolding of the storyline is disrupted by hoaxes, yet forthose in tune with the plot, the fakes become evermore obvious, like glitches inthe logic of the script.The appearance in 1990 of the Alton Barnes pictogram was the point in themystery at which my participation was engaged, and something in my subconsciousmemory was triggered as I entered the stage. What enlightening power lay behindthis alien-looking glyph?The “circle and trident” at the head of the Alton Barnes pictogram isessentially a reversed “E” attached to an “O,” or eye; these are clues to thenonphysical nature of its creators. Interesting here is that the word “alien”loosely breaks up into two old Hebrew words: El Ayin. El means “god”; Ayin, thesixteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, has the value “0” and represents “eye.”El Ayin could therefore mean “The Eye of God” or God's omnipresence; in ancientEgypt this was the Eye of Horus, the ultimate source of Light or enlightenment:an expression of such being the cobra or uraeus upon Pharaoh's brow (Elkington2001).The Eye of Shiva, too, is associated with the third eye, and Shiva's symbol isthe trident; this appears as the twenty-third letter of the Greek alphabet, psi.This, of course, suggests psyche, in essence, a collection of wave formsotherwise known as brainwaves. Since Shiva is associated with transformation,one can begin to understand what a powerful tool for transformation this cropglyph was. For at the sight of that formation thousands of people across theworld began to awaken and remember.In India's sacred text, Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna says to Arjuna: “Whenever evilappears to be conquering, I emerge.” It appears the “gods” are returning throughthe crop circles.Over the years I have noticed how a specific crop circle suddenly awakens agroup of people, as though we are cued onto the stage to play our choreographedparts. Crop circles appear to trigger some distant memory that has lain dormantin our genes. I always hear the remark: “It was something I recognized but couldnot place.” This seems particularly true for those individuals closely involvedwith decoding the crop circle enigma.The Spiral: This re-membering, this bringing back to the mind, begins with theone element we all share in common with crop circles: the spiral.Nature manifests in spiraling motion, first as living light, swirling andthickening into energetic lines of force. From these lines descend the fourphases of matter: light, gas, liquid, and solid. This creative process wasdescribed in somewhat cosmic terms long ago by Dionysius the Areopagite: “God islight. . . . The Universe, born of an irradiance, was a downward-spiraling burstof luminosity, and the light emanating from the Primal Being established everycreated being in its immutable place” (Duby 1966). According to the Hermetic Lawof Vibration, spirit descends into matter, and by the same law, matterinevitably ascends to spirit, and clairvoyants are known to see energy leaving aperson at the point of death in the form of spirals.Image [images/p149-01.jpg]Figure 9.3 Spiral-type crop circles.That essence of spirit, indeed, of life itself, is represented by that mostevocative of spirals, the galaxy. Down here on Earth, that living energy is seeninside Neolithic stone chambers, such as Newgrange in Ireland. When soundfrequencies were administered to its smoke-filled chambers, the acousticvibrations were captured in the smoke as rising spirals (Jahn, Devereux, andIbitson 1996).59 Interestingly, at the points where the spirals appeared, themound's builders had etched similar designs in the stone walls.One of the functions of such sites as Newgrange was for the practice of chantingor “toning.” Such use of resonance was intended to alter one's state ofawareness, a tradition carried into churches, and why you find such things asaltars and en-trances in these latter-day sites of worship. The spiral'slife-giving properties are also applied in the manufacture of biodynamic farmingtreatments. Such preparations have been proven to imbue and amplifyhealth-giving properties in plants and once-sterile soil (Tompkins and Bird1992). In terms of design, the spiral form is evident in the shape of the pinecone, sunflower, or head of wheat, and reflected in a number of crop circles.The product of spiral motion is the humble crop circle. Because it lacks visualimpact, people snub the simple crop circle in favor of today's more complexpictograms and glyphs, yet since the beginning of time the circle has been thesymbol of the Prime Creator, the Godforce from whose creative spirit theUniverse was created. Paradoxically, all that emanates from it is also containedwithin it. (By the same token, it is not unusual to find that a single smallcrop circle can sometimes pack more electromagnetic energy than a 200-footpictogram.) It's remarkable how this life-giving force—whose explanation hasforever eluded scholars and philosophers—should be so neatly and simplyembodied.60As we have seen in the history of crop circles, the single circle has evolvedinto all kinds of symbols, the simplest of all being the splitting of the circleinto two, symbolic of the eternal opposites: light and dark, matter andantimatter. These evolved into the triplets (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Withthe appearance of rings, the crop circles brought an unmistakable associationwith the chemical elements of life, particularly oxygen, water, and hydrogenmolecules.61Image [images/p150-01.jpg]Figure 9.4 (a) and (b) Hydrogen molecule and crop circle; (c) and (d) Watermolecule and crop circle; (e) Crop circles suggestive of the orbits of electronsaround an atom; (f) “Celtic Cross” crop circle suggests the carbon molecule; (g)Other “Celtic Cross” crop circles.The central crop circle encircled by four satellites (the quintuplet) became thefirst recognizable logo due to its resemblance to the Celtic cross. This is thecentral life-force or God holding the four elements of earth, wind, water, andfire in equilibrium, a fundamental principle of models of Creation throughoutancient cultures from the Indo-Aryan to the Native American. This symbol isknown in chemistry as the carbon atom, the very symbol of the human being.One important difference with the “Celtic Cross” crop circles is where one ofthe elements is asymmetrical. This illustrates a fundamental principle inphysics in which chaos achieves order, yet at the point of equilibrium, orderbegins transforming into chaos. In other words, it is the process of creation,in which any living system cannot remain static (much like our need to inhaleand exhale). An example of this appeared at Silbury Hill in 1988, where one ofthe satellites in the “Celtic Cross” crop circle spiraled in the oppositedirection.Image [images/p151-01.jpg]Figure 9.5 Early pictogram crop circles.Straight Line: The first phase of communication from the Circlemakers, in ourtime, was based on a foundation of cosmological principles common to humanity.The Circlemakers began the 1990s with a new phase of language development. Thestraight line was without question the most important evolution in crop circleparlance because it is a culturally shared symbol.For example, in petroglyphs of the American Southwest, two circles connected byan avenue—the dumbbell—implies speaking. Two circles of differing sizesrepresent communication between Spirit and the physical world. Four boxesflanking the avenue of a crop circle suggest we are in communication with thefour earthly elements. When the connection between humanity and nature isbroken, as it is today, the two circles at either end of the avenue are notconnected. The straight line is also representative of the Western way of“ruler-straight” logic (as opposed to the circular Oneness of nature).Image [images/p151-02.jpg]Figure 9.6 Crop circles representing solar deities.Many prehistoric symbols also attribute a solid circle to the male principle,and a ring or circle with ring to the female. Joined by an avenue, these becomesymbols of the sacred marriage.Half-Rings: This growing communication link was augmented by the appearance ofhalfrings crowning crop circles, effectively giving them the appearance ofhaloes or solar deities. Thanks to surviving examples of the petroglyphs ofdeities from around the world, these crop circle designs can be correlated withan expression of divinity. The blending of haloes, half-rings, boxes, anddumbbell, for example, creates the symbol of Inti, the Peruvian Sun god, whosedescent to Earth is shown by a line moving down to touch the circle. Since theSun was associated with deity in antiquity, the symbol we draw today tosymbolize the Sun—the rayed circle—became also the sign of the Solar Logos. Aperfect example of this appeared at Etchilhampton, its radiating Sun connectingto the ring of Mother Earth and blessing Her with its eternal light.Image [images/p151-03.jpg]Figure 9.7 Solar Logos. Etchilhampton, 1990.Image [images/p152-01.jpg]Figure 9.8 Earth Goddess symbol from 2000 B.C. and pictogram at Chilcomb, 1990.The Earth Mother: Perhaps one of the most enduring cross-cultural symbols aroundthe world is the Earth Mother with her arms outspread in a nurturing pose. Sincecrop glyphs appear primarily in wheat—the basis of bread and the staff oflife—it was only a matter of time before the symbol of Ceres (another EarthMother expression) appeared in the fields. She is the goddess of harvest and thefertile unification of opposites, and was depicted in an elegant but simple cropdesign.Image [images/p152-02.jpg]Figure 9.9 Ceres. Fordham Place, 1990.Incidentally, the origin of cultivated wheat is as alien as the designsimprinting upon it, for there appears to be no native plant on Earth from whichit has descended. Its origin is associated with ancient gods who introduced itas a gift to aid the development of civilization. These gods, Triptolomos andQuetzalcoatl, in particular, are said to always travel in “serpent rafts” or“fiery chariots.”The concept of fertility has also made its mark in the crop circles. Onedramatic pattern at Cheesefoot Head (see figure 9.10[19_chapter09.html#fig9.10]) is also found in Rosicrucian imagery as the symbolof the fertile union between male and female. A similar principle lies behindthe split ovum design at Rough Down (see figure 9.10[19_chapter09.html#fig9.10]), where the crop circle design shares an affinitywith the design of nearby Avebury stone circle. The spurs on the Rough Downformation show knowledge of the paths taken by the Michael and Mary geodeticlines as they flow through the sacred site (more on this in chapter 12[22_chapter12.html#c12]).Image [images/p152-03.jpg]Figure 9.10 (a) Cheesefoot Head, 1995; (b) Rough Down, 1991; (c) spermfertilizing egg; (d) Avebury circle with path of male and female energy lines.The Tetrahedron: One of the most important alchemical and Hermetic symbols ofall time is the tetrahedron (the four-sided pyramid), principally because of itsfunction as the prime bonding pattern of matter. The figure was well known toQabbalists and Rosicrucians (who stem from the Egyptian Mystery schools), and itsurvives in Gnostic manuscripts of the Middle Ages, even in a rare work from1735 by the German Gnostic Georgius von Welling (von Welling 1735; Petraeus1578).Although it is sometimes veiled in the obscure alchemical language common to theperiod, the tetrahedron describes the process of creation (see figure 9.12[19_chapter09.html#fig9.12]). The balls on the tips of the triangle representthe three prime alchemical elements: salt, sulfur, and mercury. These are spuntogether and held in equilibrium, as the breath from the Creator (the centralcircle with outwardly radiating rings) activates the process. Sometimes theelements are described more fundamentally as water, fire, and air (also veiledin Western religion as the three sources of Light: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)which are contained within the triangle of equality.Image [images/p153-01.jpg]Figure 9.11 Qabbalistic diagrams from the seventeenth century works of RobertFludd: (a) The “Divine Triangle”; (b) The emblematic manifestation of thetrinitarian nature of the Universe.The tetrahedron is also said to be a formula “for changing base metals intogold,” a promise which sent many ardent alchemists on a futile, centuries-longquest to be the first to amass riches. Unfortunately, the allegorical meaning ofthis transformation was often overlooked, for the process has little to do withchanging metals and more to do with the inner transformation of the individual.The tetrahedron is a guide to understanding the Universal mechanics of light,sound, and magnetism, and how an understanding of such transforms the base metal(physical human) into gold (spiritually enlightened human).Image [images/p153-02.jpg]Figure 9.12 Alchemical tetrahedron from Michespacher's Qabbalah in Alchymia,1616.Early one morning in 1991, this process of material manifestation reappeared atthe foot of Barbury Castle. As scholar John Michell discovered, the structure ofthe tetrahedron crop glyph represents a collection of numerical, musical, andgeometrical harmonies which founded the prevailing order in every oldcivilization. Michell explains:Image [images/p153-03.jpg]Figure 9.13It demonstrates the principle of Three in One by means of a central circle whichexactly contains the combined areas of the three circles around it. Moreover,the sum of all the four circular areas in the [crop glyph] is 31680 square feet.. . . In traditional cosmology, 31680 was taken to be the measure around thesub-lunary world, and the early Christian scholars calculated the number 3168 asemblematic of Lord Jesus Christ. The same number was previously applied to thename of a leading principle in the pagan religion (Michell 1991).Michell, a brilliant and insightful scholar of the antiquities, particularly ofgematria and the works of Plato, said of this number 316.8 that it is the numberof feet in the circumference of the lintel ring at Stonehenge and the perimetersquare of St. Mary's Chapel in Glastonbury; it is a ratio of the 31,680 miles ofa perimeter square around the Earth, or the number of furlongs of its meanradius. “The number 3168 is superabundant, the Pythagorean term for a numberwhich is exceeded by the sum of its factors. The sum of all the numbers whichdivide into 3168 is 6660, connecting the number of the Lord Jesus Christ withthat of the Beast of Revelation” (Michell 1988b). To Michell, the Barbury Castlecrop glyph represented nothing less than a divine revelation.The Moon: Shifting from the cosmic to the astral were the crop glyphs of 1994,taking on the form of “thought bubbles,” then mutating from them through theincorporation of crescents into glyphs resembling spiders and scorpions. Severalof these crescent glyphs bear a striking similarity to astrolabes, instrumentsformerly used to measure the angle of the Sun and stars and to mark thestereographic projection of spheres. Circles and crescents were a particularfeature of lunar counting systems in use around 7000 B.C. throughout Iberia(Hawkins 1973); the calendrical explanation is reinforced by the fact that in1994 there were thirteen crop glyphs of this type—the number of months in thelunar year.Image [images/p154-01.jpg]Figure 9.14 Top: lunar crop glyphs; bottom, left to right: Scorpion, Oroboros,spider, and web.With this key in hand, one meaning behind the 600-foot “Scorpion” formation wasunlocked. As it appeared at the point when the Sun's eleven-year sunspot cyclewas at its ebb, the formation's eleven-circle tail seemed to reference theappearance of a forthcoming solar eclipse at a time when the Sun itself was inthe zodiacal sign of Scorpio. Another conundrum revolved around the threegrapeshot near the base of the glyph's “tail.” Later that year threeplanets—Venus, Jupiter, and Pluto—would appear close to Scorpio during the newmoon of November 3, with Scorpio lying 11° south of Earth's equator. Since the“head” of the formation consisted of two concentric rings, with a third offset,it was postulated that these marked the orbits of the three planets, with theoffset ring symbolizing the erratic nature of Pluto's orbit.62The predictive and symbolic nature of this glyph is one example of themultilayered communication aspect inherent to crop circles. It also illustrateshow important it is for academics of different backgrounds to remain open to thecross-pollination of information, seeing as it took the insights of archaeology,astronomy, and astrology to decipher this crop glyph alone.The last lunar-based glyph of 1994 outwardly looks like the Oroboros, the dragoneating its own tail, Greek symbol of the infinite cycle of the cosmos. Itsthirteen circles again reference the lunar cycle, with the Moon reflected as acrescent at the head of the design. Esoterically, the destiny of the Moon is toreabsorb forms and re-create them—purify them, if you like—so the appearance oflunar references in 1994 seems apt. Given the acrimony and the hoaxing that hadunfolded in the wake of Doug and Dave, 1994 marked a resurgence of communicationfrom the Circlemakers.In certain African cultures, the spider is also symbolic of such two-waycommunication, so it is not by accident that we saw that season bookended by“Spider” and “Spider Web” crop glyphs, the latter symbolically placed beside thelunar temple of Avebury.63The rebirth of the female Moon is often symbolized by a goddess emerging from aflower. Such a “flower” appeared in 1995 at Kingsclere, its five petalspartitioned into a pentagram (geometric symbol of the Moon) and shaped likeboar's teeth, a cross-cultural symbol of the virile power of the life force.The Planets: Heavenly is certainly a fitting description of the formations of1995, the year when crop glyphs generally appeared to take on the form ofplanetary trajectories, even galaxies. Of the four “planet” patterns, the moststudied was the “Solar System” formation at Longwood Warren, not just because itshowed the orbits of our inner planets with 99 percent accuracy,64 but becausethe Earth was missing from the layout. Much speculation surrounded thisomission, the majority of which was not entirely optimistic. However, astronomerGerald Hawkins (noted author of Stonehenge Decoded) provided a logical andpositive decipherment.Image [images/p155-01.jpg]Figure 9.15 Kingsclere, 1995.Hawkins took the exact alignment of planets indicated in this crop glyph andcalculated the two occasions during the twentieth century when their positionsappeared as such in the solar system. The first, November 6, 1903, is rememberedas the day the Wright brothers proved at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, that, givenwings, man could fly. The second, July 11, 1971, marked another milestone inflight: the spacecraft Mariner 9, the first craft ever to orbit Mars, was makingits way to our red neighbor.So it would seem the Circlemakers left out the Earth to point out they weredealing with our preoccupation with non-earthbound activities. And in caseanyone feels like stamping coincidence on this explanation, the events tookplace sixtyseven years apart, a fact precisely referenced by the number of“asteroids” and grapeshot encircling this crop glyph.Image [images/p155-02.jpg]Figure 9.16 Longwood Warren crop glyph (left), and other solar-systemformations.Image [images/p156-01.jpg]Figure 9.17 Relationship between crop circle and the X-ray pattern in beryllium.Just as crop glyphs incorporate such macroscopic concepts, so can theydemonstrate microscopic ones. Located within shouting distance of HarwellLaboratory, where the science of atoms is researched, a crop design appearedwhose construction showed the same geometric pattern found in the X-ray fractalarray of beryllium, which in turn bears a striking similarity to theconstruction patterns prevalent in sacred geometry and mandalas (see figure 9.17[19_chapter09.html#fig9.17]).The Grid Square: One of the primary concerns of ancient philosophies such asQabbalah, Hermeticism, or that of the Freemasons, was the effort to measure orestimate philosophically the parts and proportions of the microcosm, and throughthis to create on Earth a mirror image of the order of the Universe.The blueprint they used was the circle, symbol of the realm of God or themacrocosm, inside which was inscribed the square representing the physicalworld.65 To undertake the measuring of the physical world, the square containeda grid; an illustration of this exists in Cesariano's Edition of Vetruvius andCornelius Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia, in which we see the outstretchedlimbs of Man contained within the square as the foundation of the world, withthe man's navel as the center (this diagonal division of the grid square willhave deeper implications explained in chapter 13 [23_chapter13.html#c13]). Inaddition to its use by the Freemasons, this checkerboard emblem was the tracingboard of the Dionysiac architects, whose function and origins can also be tracedback to the Egyptian Mystery schools, and whose influence on architecture andthe arts pervaded India, Asia Minor, and the Mediterranean countries, eventuallyfinding its way to England.Image [images/p156-02.jpg]Figure 9.18 Vitruvius' checkerboard blueprint was used by the EgyptianFreemasons for transposing the archetypal world of God onto the physical plane.“One of the most illustrious of their number was Vitruvius,” wrote philosopherManly P. Hall, “. . . in the various sections of his book, Vitruvius givesseveral hints as to the philosophy underlying the Dionysiac concept of theprinciple of symmetry applied to the science of architecture, as derived from aconsideration of the proportions established by Nature between the parts andmembers of the human body” (Hall 1932).These enlightened beings also referred to themselves as the Sons of Solomon,whose hexagonal symbol (Solomon's Seal) is prevalent throughout sacred geometryand crop glyphs. This connection with architecture reaffirms the importance ofsacred geometry and its encoding into sermons of stone throughout the world. AsHall elegantly phrases it:The supreme ambition of the Dionysiac Architects was the construction ofbuildings which would create distinct impressions consistent with the purposefor which the structure itself was designed. . . . They labored, therefore, tothe end of producing a building perfectly harmonious with the structure of theuniverse itself. . . . As a logical deduction from their philosophic trend ofthought, such a building—en rapport with the Cosmos—would also have become anoracle (Hall 1937, 1928).Such is the philosophical importance behind the grid square. If you had aninclination to be immersed in these thoughts, 1997 was a particularly good yearto do so. Approximately 100 feet south of the stylized six-petaled Seal ofSolomon at Etchilhampton lay a second glyph—a large circle enclosing an unusualgrid square, consisting of twentyeight parallel lines by twenty-five (creatingtwenty-nine by twenty-six rectangles). From the air, the 120-foot-wide designresembled God's morning waffle, although it also brought to mind Plato'sdescription of Atlantis in Critias, a rectangular plain defined by channels ofwater.Image [images/p157-01.jpg]Figure 9.19 “Grid Square” crop glyph. Etchilhampton, 1997.As mentioned earlier, the grid square was used as a blueprint. Upon it wereplaced geometric, geodetic, and mathematical calculations—information based onthe accurate study of nature that provided the foundation of greatcivilizations, particularly that of Egypt. The “Grid Square” crop circle notonly makes reference to that information, but shares tantalizing associationswith Egypt, beginning with its most famous building. Located at latitude 51° 20'05”, the “Grid Square” references the slope angle of the Great Pyramid of Gizehwith an infinitesimal deviation of 0° 00' 51”. And where the base of the pyramidis deviated from north by 0° 0', 0° 3', 0° 3', and 0° 0' respectively, the “GridSquare's” base shows practically identical compass deviations of 0° 0', 0° 5',0° 3', and 0° 0'.66Comprised of twenty-eight by twenty-five lines, the design of the “Grid Square”appears to deliberately reference other natural processes: twenty-eightrepresents the days in the traditional lunar month, the number of days requiredfor cells of the outer layer of skin to regenerate, and the pound-weight ofcarbon in the average human body. The lunar cycle once provided the foundationfor the number of characters in the Arabic alphabet, itself created according tothe lunar mansions; the prophet Muhammad is himself compared to the Full Moon,as is the Egyptian god, Osiris (Schimmel 1993; Schneider 1994). The numbertwenty-eight also references the Royal Cubit (measured by the width of fourfingers multiplied seven times). As a distillation of precise calculations ofthe Earth, it was the favored unit of measure used in the building of Egyptiantemples and in the calculation of geographic distances.The number twenty-five contains important references of its own. It is thesquare of the sacred number five (the pentagram, symbol of living things). Assuch, it was regarded by Christian Gnostics as the perfection of the fivesenses, and consequently, a measure of the enlightened being. And so the numbertwenty-five marked the spiritual resurrection of the individual. In relation tothe Great Pyramid, twenty-five pyramid inches mark the length of another precisesystem of measure, the sacred cubit, an exact ten-millionth of the Earth's polarradius.67 This unit was used in the construction of the Pyramid's antechamber,which encodes the number of days in the solar year. The chamber is 5 cubitssquared (Mück 1958; Rutherford 1945).The “Grid Square” glyph's choice of 28:25 therefore seems hardly by “accident,”referencing as it does such an array of universal relationships. The same can besaid when we look at the design not as lines, but as a series ofrectangles—twenty-nine by twenty-six in all.The number twenty-nine is symbolic of the leap lunar month and the number ofbones in the human skull. The number twenty-six represents the number ofvertebrae in the human spine, the numerical value of “Jehovah” in gematria, andthe days of rotation of the Sun relative to the Earth (Gaunt 1995). Mostimportant of all, 26.943 is the square root of the slant height of the GreatPyramid. Interestingly, 2694 is the unified harmonic of the structure of thehydrogen atom (Cathie 1995), the primary element of life.The level to which this information exists in this crop circle shows that itsmakers are working with the same principles of wisdom once employed by thefounder gods of Egypt. Given that both the Egyptians and the Circlemakers haverarely used measure and metaphor by accident, let's take the associationsfurther. Aside from 28:25 and 29:26, other numerical coincidences abound betweenthe “Grid Square” and Egypt.To begin with, the total number of rectangles of the “Grid Square,” to which isadded the complete crop glyph itself, is identical to the footlength of theGreat Pyramid, which is 755.Then we have 55:30, the number of rectangles along two edges of the “GridSquare,” and it's average meter length. When calculating the middle latitude oftheir kingdoms the Egyptians took 55° 30', and halved it. The reason for usingthis northern latitude was that it measured the same length as one degree oflongitude at the Equator. Coincidentally, 55° 30' marks the location of sacredsites on the Scottish isle of Arran, a sister power point to Avebury, whichitself lay seven miles from the “Grid Square.”One degree of latitude consists of sixty minutes, and in the northern kingdom ofancient Egypt the length of minute measured 900 Egyptian khe; 900 is also thearea of the “Grid Square.” Also, the length of a minute for the southern kingdomwas 3600 khe—the area of the “Grid Square” multiplied by four, the number of itsedges.The only numerical connection that shows any wild discrepancy is 29:53 (the 29rectangles along one edge of the “Grid Square” plus the 53 total lines). Thegeodetic reference point for the mapping of Egypt was marked by the siting ofthe village of Saqqara—named after the god of orientation—at 29° 51' north(Tompkins 1988; Rutherford 1945).These connections would imply that the “Grid Square” crop circle has a strategicmapping purpose. In fact, it would seem that someone is out to measure somethingin relationship to the Earth, if not the Earth itself (this will be examined inchapter 13 [23_chapter13.html#c13]). Yet the connections do not end here.Ironically, there stands at Saqqara a six-step limestone pyramid containing ablue tile chamber whose walls are decorated in rectangular segments which, atfirst glance, one could easily mistake for an aerial photo of this crop circle.Clearly, a relationship exists between the creators of ancient Egypt and thisgroup of Circlemakers. No doubt other numerical relationships await ourdiscovery. However, without making matters too complicated, I'd like to returnto the two most obvious pairs of numbers given by the “Grid Square”—28:25 and29:26. Conspicuous by its absence in that sequence is the number 27. Perhapsthis was an invitation to investigate, particularly as this number is full ofassociations with energy and its movement in space.Constructing a circle and a square of equal areas (“squaring the circle”) hasbeen one of the greatest challenges to geometers. One way of achieving anaccurate result is to use a ratio of 27.32. Such a “squared circle” isgeometrically encoded in the positioning of the stones at Stonehenge, just as27.32° forms the angle between Stonehenge and its attendant tumulus to the east,the same one that generates its geodetic power. Interestingly, 27.32 is also therelative percentage in the diameters of spinning disks used in magneticlevitation (Myers and Percy 1999).If we view the “Grid Square” from the air as a three-dimensional object, itresembles a set of densely packed cubes. Mathematically, twentyseven is threecubed, just as twenty-seven points are required to geometrically define ahypersphere (a 4-D sphere) in our three dimensional space (ibid.). And speakingof spheres, the period of revolution of the Moon around the Earth is 27.2 days.In Old Testament gematria, twenty-seven is the number of light, just as inHebrew it is the number of illumination (Gaunt 1995), something this particularcrop glyph has not been short of. The number twenty-seven is also the differencein frequency between the notes F and G. Arithmetically this is split into twoparts, the lesser of thirteen units and the greater of fourteen units. Theminuscule region between these parts is called the “Pythagorean comma,” and itis marked by the note F-sharp (Levin 1994).F-sharp is regarded with great respect by the ancient Chinese as Hu, the tone ofthe Earth. Native American flute makers to this day tune their instruments toserenade Mother Earth to this note. It also appears to have had significantinfluence among the pyramid builders of ancient Egypt. After he conducted aseries of experiments inside the Kings' Chamber of the Great Pyramid, acousticengineer Tom Danley identified four resonant frequencies, or notes, that areenhanced by the dimensions and materials used in its construction. The notesform an F-sharp chord which, according to ancient Egyptian texts, was theharmonic of our planet. Moreover, Danley's tests show that these frequencies arepresent in the Kings' Chamber even when no sounds are being produced.68 So wesee yet more connections with our Egyptian ancestors. (However, the fullimplications of F-sharp relative to the “Grid Square” crop circle will berevealed in chapter 13 [23_chapter13.html#c13].)By virtue of its design—unique at the time—the “Grid Square” gives theimpression of a metaphysical surveyor at work, perhaps more so in view that thedesign resembles the net of geodetic energy that clings to the Earth. This hasnot been described yet in this book, but it was rediscovered in modern times byErnst Hartmann. The “Hartmann Grid” is spaced out in lines 8.25 inches thick,each line spaced in intervals of 6.5 feet (north to south) and 8 feet (east towest), creating an invisible rectangular net closely akin to the mathematicalroots of the Great Pyramid (Merz 1987). As it turns out, the average rectanglein the “Grid Square” crop circle is in ratio to Hartmann's grid, including itsspacing, with a discrepancy of the thickness of an ear of wheat.Image [images/p160-01.jpg]Figure 9.20 “Sunflower” glyph, symbolic of the crown chakra.Images of Eastern Faiths: The association between crop glyphs and elements ofEastern faith have been particularly strong over the years, the most dramaticexample undoubtedly being the revered Sri Yantra design, its thirteen miles oflines and triangles etched into a dry lake bed in Oregon. This was matched inEngland by the “Sunflower,” the crowning point of the 2000 season and a fittingtitle considering the design is reminiscent of the thousand-petaled lotus of thecrown chakra as represented in Hindu iconography.Residing in each of the seven main chakras are seeds of sound, the activation ofwhich is traditionally done through the chanting of mantras. One of the mostpowerful of these is the bija mantra (“secret name”), which Hindu texts describeas a relationship between life energy and sacred sound belonging to no language.When directed at the crown chakra, this mantra is said to evoke the image of asunflower unfolding. This same image can be created by singing a prolonged,high-pitched note and directing its vibration onto powder.The first of two Windmill Hill crop glyphs also carries Eastern overtones, andits design is based on the foundation geometry for temples dedicated to theHindu god Vishnu, the Preserver. It also bears a striking resemblance to thesquare star branch of the Koch series of computer fractals.Image [images/p161-01.jpg]Figure 9.21 Relationship of Windmill Hill crop glyph to a square fractal. 1999.This overlapping of Western fractals and Eastern imagery applies to the “TripleJulia Set,” whose interlocking spiral motif is found throughout Buddhist faiths.This motif is said to represent the threefold nature of the soul, as well as thefundamental structure of creation.In Dzogchen (said to be the highest form of Tibetan Buddhism), this threefoldspiral is representative of the stages to enlightenment: using compassion andknowledge to overcome the limitations of the physical world; contemplating themechanics of duality and freeing the spirit from rationality; and finally, theliberation from conditioned existence and the achievement of wisdom.69Chakras and Teardrops: The Eastern connection was particularly strong throughout1996's crop circle season. Two strange glyphs, believed at first to be, on onelevel, a form of Sanskrit, turned out to be symbols for the root chakra and thesolar plexus chakra in a more ornamental form than usual. The glyphs at Roundwayand Etchilhampton were each marked with a teardrop, the Hindu symbol for achakra (see figure 9.23 [19_chapter09.html#fig9.23]).70Image [images/p162-01.jpg]Figure 9.22 The Tibetan Wheel of Joy and its crop circle counterpart.Yet these glyphs conceal a second layer of meaning. The Etchilhampton formation,if placed with the tear at the top, makes a hieroglyph resembling a sphinx. TheSphinx is associated with the attainment of knowledge, and in Egypt thisenigmatic figure rests atop a reputed Hall of Records containing a library ofinformation about the Atlantean civilization and the Universe. In Westernsymbology, however, the Sphinx is represented by the horse (depicted in thiscrop glyph with its tail in the air) and is associated with transformation (as aresult of enlightenment through knowledge); in Islamic art, the winged horsebearing the Archangel Gabriel (the bringer of annunciation and truth) wears ateardrop upon his breast. This is the tear of Isis, who sheds her tear for thetransformation of the world.The Roundway crop glyph (see figure 9.23 [19_chapter09.html#fig9.23]) with thetear pointing towards the front paws reveals Anubis, guardian of souls in theEgyptian Underworld. Looming over Anubis is a hatchet, ceremonial symbol of thePharaoh asserting his power; both are nestled within the laid crop shaped like apyramid. Since the circle represents God, the tear emanating from God issymbolic of the Son descending to the physical plane. It would seem, therefore,that we are presented with a parable describing consciousness descending fromHeaven, bringing with it Universal knowledge and that through such wisdom, theLight will reassert its power on Earth. Some might term this the Second Coming.Image [images/p162-02.jpg]Figure 9.23 Top: Solar plexus chakra/horse crop glyph, Etchilhampton. Bottom:Root chakra/Anubis with axe, Roundway, 1996.The Lotus: I picked up this spiritual thread in the year 2000, thanks to anunfolding five petal “lotus” crop glyph at the foot of Golden Ball Hill. Flowingtowards a folded sixth petal was what appeared to be a ball with a flame or aseed.In Hindu philosophy, the lotus is the “flower of Light,” a symbol of matter andspirit, cause and effect. Its leaves, flowers, and fruit are said to form thefigure of a circle, so it is considered a symbol of perfection. Its petalsrepresent spiritual unfolding, and the seedpod the fecundity of creation—the“superhuman” rising out of and above the mud of the physical world.Consequently, the “flame” in this lotus glyph represents unfolding wisdom andspiritual revelation.The lotus is an indispensable attribute of every creative god and one finds itsimage engraved on all the monuments built along the Nile as well as on theheaddresses of the divine kings who built them. Buddha, too, is said to havemanifested as a flame from a lotus. Its association with creation is beautifullydescribed in an Eastern myth: During the Nights of Brahma, Vishnu floats asleepon the primordial waters, stretched out on the blossom of a lotus which growsout of Brahma's navel. His goddess consort, Lakshmi, arises before him from thelotus beneath her feet. At the churning of the Ocean of Milk, Lakshmi isre-formed of the froth of the foaming waves and appears before an assembly ofastonished gods, borne on a lotus and with another lotus held in her hands.Image [images/p163-01.jpg]Figure 9.24 “Lotus.” Golden Ball Hill, 2000.In essence, the myth is analogous to an individual stepping out of ignorance,and through knowledge one's true nature opens like petals to reveal the inner,enlightened being. On another level, the myth serves to illustrate the constantunfolding process of manifestation. As with the sphinx and the horse, the lotushas its Western counterpart in the rose, the symbol of truth (see figure 9.26 onpage A10 in the color section). This appeared later in the summer of 2000 at thebase of Dragon Hill and Uffington hill fort, where an enigmatic figure carvedout of the chalk sits in the shape of a white horse.Image [images/p164-01.jpg]Figure 9.25 With the outer petals shifted 19.47 degrees relative to the innerpetals, the circular geometry of the “lotus” gives the impression of spin.Connecting the Thread: The Eight-Spoked Wheel: Crop glyphs that reaffirm theregenerative aspect of life have on occasion encoded predictions or processeswith farreaching implications, particularly when connected like a string ofwords that over time reveal a bigger picture. We begin with that controversial“Wheel of Dharma” (1992), a reference to the Buddhist path of initiation. It hascounterparts in the Egyptian mysteries and Celtic shamanic culture, whileIslamic culture portrays this by the octagon, representing the Breath of Allah.Based upon the octave, the eightfold spiritual path is undertaken by a soul toachieve its highest level of Self. Every soul reincarnates to experience aspecific path in life in accordance with its evolutionary need, attaching itselfto a physical being a day before it is birthed by the mother; subsequently, itchooses to experience being blind, bullied, poor, wealthy, faithful, charitable,and so on, but always in accordance with a specific path. When every path hasbeen mastered, the soul achieves total understanding of its Self and the laws ofUniversal being. To put it another way, it finds God within. Should the soul notachieve its purpose in one lifetime, it may repeat the process. Think of it as akind of Divine driving test.Image [images/p164-02.jpg]Figure 9.27 “Wheel of Dharma.” Silbury, 1992.Each of the symbols representing the eightfold path adorns a compass point onthis crop glyph: occupying the north slot is the short trident of the Sun, thecentral fire and source of wisdom; in the northeast is the crescent Moon, thepath of inspiration, regeneration, and rebirth; in the east, the keyholesymbolizes the gaining of insight; in the southeast, the heart of Bos, the bull,the path of ascent through truth and strength; in the south, the horns ofCernunnos, symbol of our animal nature and the path of the regenerated soulcoming forth; in the southwest, the cosmos, marked by the triad of body, ego,and soul, harmonized through insight; and in the west, the key of Mercury,representing illumination and the emergence of spirituality which unlocks theMysteries within the individual.71This leaves us with one final symbol. Or it doesn't, since in the crop glyph aphysical water trough stands in its place. Did the Circlemakers miscalculate orwas this apparent error trying to point something out?The remaining symbol pertains to the Path of Cleansing. On one level, to bathein water is to immerse oneself in knowledge; knowledge leads to enlightenment,and enlightenment inevitably brings social change. Is the “Wheel of Dharma” cropglyph prophesying coming changes?If we look at ancient timekeeping traditions, they point to our present time asthe end of a grand evolutionary cycle and the birth of a new age, the Age ofAquarius—the sign of the water bearer and an apt description of a water trough.Hopi, Lakota, and Cherokee traditions refer to our present time as the FifthWorld, and they too maintain that it is coming to a close. But it is the Mayancalendar of the Great Cycles that provides another clue. According to this18,000-year-old timekeeper, the present cycle is completed in 2012 A.D.; itsremaining 20 year sub-cycle was set in motion in 1992 (Arguelles 1985),precisely the year this crop glyph appeared. Is it possible then, that themissing symbol is pointing to a final phase in our present evolutionary chain?The Serpent: This train of thought continues in 1999 with the “Coiled Serpent”crop glyph which, as it happens, appeared on the very day marking the end of theAztec calendar. Outwardly, its nine coils are symbolic of utmost expression (theTrinity times three), of perfection itself, while its head tilts in anticipationof the next stage of expression (see figure 9.28 on page A10 in the colorsection). The serpent represents the creative Universal energy, and for thisreason the Aztec/Mayan/Toltec god Quetzalcoatl is depicted as such (Coatlrepresents energy moving in waves or spirals, a precursor to the electromagneticwave of science); the coiled serpent is also known as kundalini, the life forcethat rises from the base of the spine, stimulating the chakra system as itspirals toward the crown chakra in the top of the head.Which brings us to the head of the crop glyph itself, a vesica piscis emergingfrom a circle. This can be viewed symbolically either as the Egyptian spearpoint or the Catholic bishop's mitre, symbols of Ultimate Light and Sunrespectively (Elkington 2001). As the seed of the ultimate Light, Jesus Christis often depicted sitting within such a motif. So again, in one respect, thisglyph is representative of the ultimate creative principle.72However, the coils of the serpent are also symbolic of positive and negativepolarities, the forces of disorganization and transformation. So what exactlywas this crop glyph transforming?Image [images/p166-01.jpg]Figure 9.29 Is someone trying to say something? East Field pictograms from 1990,1996, and 1999.Traditionally, gods attributed with a serpent cure, physically or spiritually,were regarded as resonances or wave patterns (Elkington 2001). If you view the“Coiled Serpent” crop glyph horizontally it resembles a standing wave pattern,just as shown on an oscilloscope (see figure 9.30 [19_chapter09.html#fig9.30]).Its “mitre” or Sun now appears to creep above a horizon. In reality, as the Sunrises over the horizon, living organisms (particularly wheat and barley) becomemore receptive to light, given that DNA is reliant on this electromagnetic forcefor information. As the frequency of solar energy rises above the horizon itimprints itself in all living organisms.Image [images/p166-02.jpg]Figure 9.30 “Coiled Serpent” glyph depicting the sunrise.Given that the barley of the “Coiled Serpent” was uniquely laid down like a DNAspiral (which had appeared as a crop circle three years earlier and in the samefield), one can speculate that this crop glyph was encoding energy into theliving Earth. If so, what is this energy doing?DNA: One possible explanation lies in a bizarre-looking crop circle from 1991which produced a myriad of explanations concerning genetics, not least becauseit resembles a splitting chromosome (see figure 9.31[19_chapter09.html#fig9.31]).73 It was named the “Froxfield Serpent” (after itslocation). At first it was postulated that the Circlemakers were making astatement about our DNA's state of health due to the weakening of the ozonelayer, but when author Gregg Braden looked at this glyph, something made himexplore it in a different direction.He found that out of the sixty-four codons in our genetic code, forty-four areunused (Rothwell 1988; Braden 1993). Since nature rarely designs thingssuperfluously, such apparent redundancies along the DNA strand may be structureswaiting to be activated. Braden took the segments of the formation, none ofwhich were identical in length, and calculated them as a percentage of the wholedesign. Then he took a map of the human DNA containing the significant locationsof amino acids and superimposed the relative percentages from the mapped cropcircle. He concluded:Of the nine break sites, one is an area known as ribosomal RNA [ribonucleicacid], one plots into an area known as Cytochrome Oxidase II, one is in ATPasesubunit 6, and the remaining plot onto URF (unassigned reading frames) 3, 4 and5. While all of these locations are significant, the six URF locations areparticularly interesting. URF sites mark zones within the DNA molecule thatappear to be “unused,” at this time, in the coding of the amino acids. If, forsome reason, these sites are shut down (breaks), coding will not occur. If newproteins, resulting from new amino acids are to occur, these sites provide thestaging area for the building of these structures (Braden 1993).The data from the “Froxfield Serpent” makes us wonder if we are looking at acoding sequence taking place via crop glyphs. RNA can be likened to data in acomputer disk, part of which lies unused, as if allowing for furtherinstructions. A predictive reference supporting this train of thought exists inTablet 8 of The Emerald Tablets of Thoth, an ancient Egyptian text: “Man is inthe process of changing to forms that are not of this world. Grows he in time tothe formless, a plane on the cycle above. Know ye, ye must become formlessbefore ye are one with the Light” (Doreal 1925).It is too soon to prove that changes in human DNA can be directly linked to thesudden buildup of crop circles—even if a DNA glyph did appear once in the samefield as the “Serpent”—primarily because no funds or protocols exist to carryout such testing. However, support for the theory that electromagnetism in cropcircles is capable of altering DNA comes from the pioneering work of Dr. ChiangKanzhen (a formerly imprisoned Chinese scientist who escaped to Russia), whoresearches bioenergetic communication. Dr. Kanzhen's work demonstrates how DNAis a passive data storage device comprising active material carriers in the formof bioelectromagnetic signals. These are photons possessing corpuscular and waveproperties capable of transmitting energy and information.74Image [images/p167-01.jpg]Figure 9.31 One-of-a-kind ribbon crop circle at Froxfield 1991 (left) referencesstrategic breaks in the human DNA.Image [images/p167-02.jpg]Figure 9.32 Division of the cell. Note the similarity of two crop glyphs from1991 to the centrosomes (arrowed).These photons operate at the extreme ends of the electromagnetic spectrum,namely, at very low frequencies (which excite the photons) and very highfrequencies (the bandwidth capable of transmitting large amounts ofinformation). Any excitation of the bioelectromagnetic field is thereforetransmitted to the DNA, and in laboratory experiments genetic information hasalready been successfully transmitted from one organism to another (Kanzhen1993).For more than a decade, Irish molecular biologist and immunologist Colm Kelleherhas also researched the structure and properties of the 97 percent of ourgenetic material that does not code for protein, and discovered that more than amillion sequences in human DNA have the property of being able to “jump” fromchromosome to chromosome. When activated to jump, these sequences, or“transposons,” are capable of large-scale genetic change in a very short time.Kelleher proposes that the activation of the transposons is done through theintense spiritual energy experienced in altered states such as shamanicinitiations, near-death experiences, and UFO close encounters. Anecdotal reportsof spontaneous healings of cancer, auto-immune diseases, and a variety ofchronic illnesses during these heightened states are increasing.75 As we shallsee in the following chapters, healings and heightened states of awareness arealso associated with crop circle contact.The third piece of supporting evidence for the crop-circle/DNA link comes from areport by Dr. Berenda Fox, a holistic practitioner in the U.S. who researchesimmunological testing and therapy. Her analysis of blood samples collected sincethe early 1980s shows that people have developed what appears to be a thirdstrand of DNA. People seem to be changing at a molecular level, says Dr. Fox.76Some of the reported symptoms associated with this change include a feeling ofnot “being here,” exhaustion, the need for extra rest, mental confusion, lack ofconcentration on routine tasks, and aches and pains which appear to have nospecific cause. Women go through hormonal changes, experiencing earlier (orlater) menopause, and men experience frustration through the exhaustion causedby the process. Many of these same symptoms have been associated with exposureto crop circles (see chapter 12 [22_chapter12.html#c12]).If such hypotheses are correct and molecular changes in the human body areunderway, the evolutionary consequences are on cue with ancient predictions thathave foreseen changes in humanity's spiritual and physical structure as it nearsthe close of cycles. Moreover, indigenous cultures mention that signs wouldappear on Earth as the changes accelerate.Are crop glyphs the “Language of Light” described in The Keys of Enoch, asrevealed to J. J. Hurtak in 1973, “to prepare mankind for the activation ofevents that are to come to pass in the next thirty years of earth time”? The“Keys” were revealed to Hurtak shortly before the unfolding of recent cropcircle activity, yet he described them as “geometrical light structures used totranscribe knowledge from Father Universe to Son Universe” (Hurtak 1977).The link between these proposed light structures and crop circle designs hassome validity, and in later chapters I discuss how geometry, sound, and lightwork synchronistically in the crop circle process. Enoch's teachings alsostipulate that these symbols would help propel humanity from one state toanother, aid its spiritual development, and assist science in understanding theUniverse. The Light language, Hurtak said, would be given to help us cope withthis change: the “spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit given so spiritual man canwork with the Light Beings.”“Since these teachings are applicable to the various sciences,” wrote Dr.Hurtak, “not everyone will comprehend all of the Keys equally, nor will the fullcomplexity of each Key be fully meaningful at the present time of ourparticipation. . . . Therefore, not all the Keys will appeal to the same type ofscientific and consciousness evolution because they work on various levels ofunderstanding and are connected with the totality of knowing ‘the Light’—theprimary frequency of the Infinite Mind” (ibid.).At this point the skeptic might well ask: “If these beings—the Circlemakers—areso advanced, why don't they communicate in plain, ordinary English? Why putpeople through such an agonizing obstacle course, cloaking their messages behindthe veil of symbol and obscure philosophical iconography?” Well, would we bebothered to get out of the car to investigate a field emblazoned with “GoodMorning, Earthlings. We Come From Mars.” Would we care to analyze the plants,the soil? Look for hidden geometry or math, or build an intellectual profile?Probably not.As the sinologist Sukie Colgrave points out, based on analysis of the works ofConfucius, the trouble is that “while words contain genuine meanings whichreflect certain absolute truths in the universe, most people have lost contactwith these truths and so use language to suit their own convenience. This led,Confucius felt, to lax thinking, erroneous judgments, confused actions andfinally to the wrong people acquiring access to political power” (Colgrave1979).Thus, words do not possess the same ability to carry a message as do symbols,and any book on etymology shows how the meanings of hundreds of everyday wordsused in our most basic transactions have been corrupted during the course ofeven a hundred years. Not only are words dependent on the abilities of those whocome into contact with them, they are vulnerable to poor translations from onelanguage to another. Besides, written and spoken word is only an approximationof reality, whereas the form of a symbol is generally a direct expression of itsfunction (see chapter 11 [21_chapter11.html#c11]).The Circlemakers are using symbols based on Universal principles, all of whichare bound within the human body. As such, their symbols in the fields arecapable of bypassing the brain's left hemisphere of reason, enabling theexchange of information to take place at a cellular level. In turn, this enablesindividuals, if they so choose, to raise their vibratory rates, preparing themto receive this language of light through the heart. The Circlemakers' approachshows great understanding of the human psyche because symbols are mysterious,and the mysterious arouses our curiosity, pushing us to examine our knowledge,thereby gaining insight.77 As Thomas Carlyle once said, “In a symbol liesconcealment of revelation.”Image [images/p170-01.jpg]Figure 9.33 Communication by the Circlemakers in Latin. Milk Hill, 1991.These symbols remain timeless and intact despite thousands of years of passingthrough the revolving doors of religion, politics, and ideology. They seem tohave been carefully screened so as not to antagonize any particular segment ofthe population. And because no crop glyph means only one thing or offers asingle solution, they are difficult and elusive for the rational-minded toaccept.Having said this, on the Celtic harvest festival of Lammas (August 2) in 1991,events prompted the Circlemakers to send a message in a different format. Bythis time, hoaxing and contamination of evidence was underway to debunk thephenomenon and undermine public confidence in all matters circular. Against thisbackground of deception, the Circlemakers dropped a series of markings upon theformation-fertile field below Milk Hill. So out of character was the scriptedpattern that at first it was dismissed as a hoax, yet closer inspection provedotherwise.The Milk Hill script, as it became known, appeared to be some type of language.It was comprised of two words separated by three line breaks, with a ring ateach end suggesting beginning and end. Was this Morse code from theCirclemakers? Gerald Hawkins felt it was important enough to gather a team oftwelve scholars and decipher it. Several months, 18,000 common phrases, and 42languages later, they arrived at an acceptable solution.They agreed that the circles at each end marked the message breaks; the tramline marked the bottom of the characters, and the twin upright lines formed wordbreaks. The message, therefore, contained two words or numbers with noabbreviations. To make sense, the message had to be an exactcharacter-by-character substitution code, and it had to be cognizable.Hawkins and his colleagues finally figured the message was in the guise ofpost-Augustan Latin: the first word, OPPONO, translated as “I oppose.” Thesecond word provided an object for the verb as ASTOS—“acts of craft andcunning.” “I oppose acts of craft and cunning.”In context of the Doug and Dave deception, this interpretation of the messagewas timely and direct in its distaste of events shortly to take place. On theother hand, the use of post-Augustan Latin, plus the fact that six out of sevenletters used for the script are traced to an obscure Knights Templar-basedalphabet, once again raised the Circlemakers' intellectual profile.78Of course, they could have communicated in English, but would anyone havebelieved them?“No further messages were written in this Knights Templar-based script after1991. Nor did anyone come forward to claim that he or she made the inscription,”Hawkins said. “Actually if any hoaxers do come forward, then we have a shortLatin quiz we would like them to take.”58In Greek, symballein is depicted as a boat, a receptacle of the sacred thatacts as a mediatory vehicle between intuition—that is inner tuition—and physicalreality, waking the individual and transporting it to its roots in the spiritualrealm where everything is order, measure, and proportion. A church or cathedralserved a similar purpose, and it's not by accident that their vaulted ceilingssymbolize the inverted hull of a ship, or why the passageway to the altar iscalled a nave, giving us navis, or boat.59The experimenters were struck by the similarities of other rock art insideNewgrange to the resonant sound patterns characterizing its chambers. Forexample, a number of these petroglyphs feature concentric circles and ellipsesthat are not unlike the plan views of the acoustical mappings. In others,sinusoidal or zigzag patterns resemble the alternative nodes and antinodes. Tothe modern viewer, the rock etchings are a form of art, yet to the ancientpilgrim they were instructional diagrams.60In gematria, the Greek word for “oneness,” monas, adds up to 360, the numberof degrees around a circumference. (Gematria is a Qabbalistic method ofinterpretation based upon the numerical value of the letters in the words inboth Greek and Hebrew alphabets.)61Hydrogen is the most plentiful element in the Universe and a basic ingredientof life. One of its signs, a ring around a nucleus, is not dissimilar to theEgyptian hieroglyph of the creator god Atum; they referred to the nucleus as thepoint of creation and the ring as the path where creation flows.62Based on information compiled by Doug Rogers/CCCS Connecticut.63Ancient sacred sites were created so as to invoke specific energies.Consequently, the gender is indicative of the type of energy flowing at thesite. Avebury was built as a lunar temple (female, receptive energy); bycomparison, Stonehenge is a solar temple. When the Roman Catholics superimposedtheir churches over pagan sites, they continued this principle when attributingthem to a particular saint (for example, St. Michael churches rest uponpositive/male energy lines).64Personal communication from Gerald Hawkins.65Fundamental to the order of the Egyptian Freemasons were the Three Tableswhich represented the mathematical laws of the Universe: The circle as theethereal, the square as the transformation of the ethereal into matter, and therectangle containing the proportions of the Golden Mean, and said to govern theprinciples of sound and light.66My thanks to Andreas Müller for his meticulous survey.67The British inch and the Imperial measuring system is largely derived from theEgyptian cubit system. Livio Stecchini explores the Egyptian system of measuresand its influence on subsequent civilizations in Peter Tompkins' The Secrets ofthe Great Pyramid.68From an interview by Boris Said on the Laura Lee Radio Show, Seattle, October1997; www.lauralee.com [http://www.lauralee.com]; also Christopher Dunn's TheGiza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt. Much of what was discoveredremains secret under a nondisclosure agreement with the Schor Foundation.69A similar process exists in the Egyptian Merkaba (light-spirit-body) whichdescribes the geometric energy array around every cell as well as the humanbody. The energy field is composed of a spinning star tetrahedron. It is saidthat by influencing the rate of spin, a person is able to overcome thegravitational field of the physical world.70Channelers around the world at the time shared the sentiment that Earth was inthe process of opening Her heart chakra. Since this would first require anactivation of the lower chakras, these two crop glyphs appear to be a form ofvalidation.71The Eightfold Path is synonymous with the 8x8 trigrams (64 hexagrams) of the IChing of the Chinese Taoists. These are combinations of yin and yang energypatterns thought to represent all possible cosmic and human situations (McKennaand McKenna 1975).72Both the “Coiled Serpent” and “Lotus” crop glyphs share the same “seed”symbology, and ironically they appeared in adjacent fields during 1999. The“Coiled Serpent” was preceded by two similar designs three and nine yearsearlier, this time in the very same field (the “DNA” and the Alton Barnespictogram). The head of the “Coiled Serpent” may also be representative of theMoon eclipsing the Sun, and this glyph preceded the solar eclipse of August1999.73Other views are expressed in Cyphers in the Crops, edited by Beth Davis.74The bioelectromagnetic field is a material carrier of biogenetic informationthat can be transmitted from one organism to another.75Journal of Scientific Exploration, National Institute for Discovery Science,vol. 13:1, Spring 1999, 9–24.76Shortly after these announcements, Dr. Fox's office was raided by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration.

THE GEOMETRY OF CROP CIRCLESKnow, oh, brother . . . that the study of sensible geometry leads to skill inall practical arts, while the study of intelligible geometry leads to skill inthe intellectual arts because this science is one of the gates through which wemove to the knowledge of the essence of the soul, and that is the root of allknowledge.—IkhnImage [images/acirc.jpg]n al-SafImage [images/acirc.jpg]There is a great misconception as to why sacred geometry is “sacred.” Somebelieve that ancient peoples lacked sophistication and intelligence, so watchinga bisection of lines create orderly geometric patterns constituted “magic.”Others argue that it was because of its association with buildings in which godswere worshipped and blood sacrifices made to appease their wrath.“Sacred or canonical geometry is not some obscure invention of the human mind,”wrote Paul Devereux, one of the world's leading writers on Earth mysteries, “butan extrapolation by it of the implied patterns in nature that frame the entry ofenergy into our space-time dimension. The formation of matter and the naturalmotions of the Universe, from molecular vibration through the growth of organicforms to the spin and motion of the planets, stars and galaxies, are allgoverned by geometrical configurations of force. One can dissect a plant or aplanet and not find the Maker's blueprint anywhere in sight, of course: it isinherent” (Devereux 1992).Image [images/p172-01.jpg]Figure 10.1 Stonehenge.Sacred geometry is a mirror of the Universe, and as such, it is timeless. It isalso a form of communication that can be accessed at ancient places. As Devereuxsays, “It is the ultimate systems language.” As we are about to see in thischapter, we are rediscovering this language in crop circles. However, toestablish the presence of sacred geometry in crop circles without firstunderstanding its purpose and impact on society—the state of human consciousnesseven—is to miss a vital function of the glyphs. Let us then briefly examinesacred geometry and its place in the greater scheme of things.Our experience of and reaction to all things beautiful is made possible by ourability to distinguish order from chaos. When we recognize the perfectioninherent in a Greek temple or a painting by da Vinci, we are subconsciouslyresponding to proportions bound by the universal laws of geometry. To quote thegeometer Robert Lawlor: “The practice of geometry was an approach to the way inwhich the Universe is ordered and sustained. Geometric diagrams can becontemplated as still moments revealing a continuous, timeless, universal actiongenerally hidden from our sensory perception. Thus a seemingly commonmathematical activity can become a discipline for intellectual and spiritualinsight” (Lawlor 1982). A substantial body of evidence for this is found in theunlikeliest of sources, Religion.As stated in Islam (particularly Sufi, its mystical half)—and echoed in theJewish and Hindu religions—sacred geometry enables humanity to see thearchetypal world of God. At its heart, the Arabic faith still contains anunadulterated snapshot of this primordial truth, in the geometric figuresadorning its mosques and art forms. Consequently, Islam has served as curatorand preserver, maintaining the purity of the philosophy of geometry, “akin tothe Pythagorean-Platonic tradition of antiquity but in a totally sacred universefree of the nationalism and rationalism which finally stifled and destroyed theesoteric traditions of Greek intellectuality,” to quote the eminent Arabichistorian S. H. Nasr (Critchlow 1976).It's not certain from where the terrestrial origin of this knowledge stems,since the forms of sacred geometry are just as evident in Celtic, Tibetan, andBuddhist art—even in native North American sand paintings. In other words,sacred geometry is a universal principle shared by cultures that seemingly hadlittle or no contact with one another.One of the earliest known practitioners of sacred geometry were the Egyptians.Its proportions were embedded in the ground plans of their temples, theirfrescoes, and in the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, whose structure contains manymathematical laws since attributed to Pythagoras. But although the enlightenedEgyptians used geometry for all manner of terrestrial applications—hencegeo-metry, “measure of the earth”—their aim was metaphysical. Egyptologist JohnAnthony West postulates: “The whole of Egyptian civilization was based upon acomplete and precise understanding of Universal laws. And this profoundunderstanding manifested itself in a consistent, coherent and inter-relatedsystem that fused science, art and religion into a single organic Unity” (West1993).The symbolic language of Egypt, together with its texts on medicine,mathematics, and science, demonstrates the Egyptians knew how the world works,and they did so without the advantages of computers or electron microscopes,proving that one does not need advanced technology to access or understand thefiner realms of life. And because the Egyptians recognized sacred geometry asthe mechanism of the heavens, they applied it liberally across the landscape formillennia as a way to bestow Universal order on Earth, a concept encapsulated inthe Hermetic maxim, “As Above, So Below.”79Image [images/p174-01.jpg]Figure 10.2 Many ancient temples were designed to encode the figures of sacredgeometry. The plan of Stonehenge is unique in that it features many of thesefigures (squared circle, pentagram, hexagram, and heptagram shown here forsimplicity).Image [images/p174-02.jpg]Figure 10.3 According to geometers Critchlow and Martineau, the relative meanorbits of planets are defined by sacred geometry.Such obvious benefits did not go unnoticed by other enlightened groups, andpermanent expressions of this knowledge were subsequently erected for posteritythroughout Europe, in the form of the Parthenon, the Temple of Delphi, Aachencathedral (whose chapel bears identical ground-plan measurements to Stonehenge),and Chartres Cathedral, one of the most impressive hymns to sacred geometry. Theknowledge made its way north to the British Isles, for it is immortalized inStonehenge. In fact, the “Pythagorean” geometric tradition was already well inuse throughout Britain some 3000 years before the Greek mathematician, asevidenced by the formulae adopted for the construction of stone circles(Strachan 1998; Thom 1967).Obviously the principles of sacred geometry were important enough for scholarsand architects to go to enormous lengths to preserve for future generations.Well, that was the idea. These practices were abolished as a form of study byorder of Emperor Theodosius in 399 A.D., the net effect being the rise of theMiddle Ages. Slowly and corrosively, codes for a life in harmony with theUniverse gave way to a predilection for violence, intolerance, terror, andpersecution. The last great works based on sacred geometry—namely the Gothic andearly Renaissance—were kept alive via Plato, the works of Vitruvius, andwhatever Hermetic and Qabbalist writings and philosophies survived suppressionby the emerging Catholic Inquisition. With the move toward an analytical view ofthe world, connections to holistic and metaphysical practices were severed, andby the time Newton and the scientific secularism of the seventeenth centuryprevailed, rational logic had gained such dominance that all esoteric knowledgewas condemned as occult.80By the twentieth century, this masculine, left-brained worldview had reached itsnadir. Man placed Nature over a barrel, harnessing its power, taming its ways,and desecrating its resources to fuel “progress.” The dubious high point of thisculture has given us the nuclear age and saddled us with a few by-products:global urbanization, depletion of resources, and toxification of the Earthwhich, social scientists point out, has fueled a meteoric rise in humanalienation and criminal behavior. Not surprisingly, worship at our ancienttemples is today rarely done for the purpose of enlightenment, but for asnapshot and a souvenir. As these temples become relegated to mere curiositiesfrom an age gone by, so our wonder of the unseen and our connection to thesacred disappears.And so a pattern emerges: The more disconnected we become from the Universalorder, the more dysfunctional we become as a society. And the longer ourumbilical connection remains severed, the more we rely on rationalism to explainour reason for being and the further we stray from spirituality. The viciouscircle is compounded by Western language being a separatist language. As Lawlorexplains: “Modern thought has difficult access to the concept of the archetypalbecause European languages require that verbs or action words be associated withnouns. We therefore have no linguistic forms with which to imagine a process oractivity that has no material carrier” (Lawlor 1982). Yet in Eastern languages,subject and object are one. Japanese lovers do not declare to one another “Ilove you,” they declare aishiteru, “loving.” Subject and object are merged intowholeness, and such a linguistic foundation is probably what enables peoples ofthe East to accept the mystical side of life more readily than their Westerncounterparts.Thankfully, the Universe moves in waves, and the cycle of darkness is inevitablymoving once again toward enlightenment. For one thing, science is discoveringthe geometry within nature. During a demonstration of an electron microscopebefore the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1937, it wasdiscovered that the crystalline structure of tungsten is composed of nine atomsgeometrically arranged like a cube. Since then, science has further discoveredthat the physical structure of elements is governed by geometric arrayssurrounding a central point. So the general assumption that the nature of matteris fundamentally composed of solid particles has given way to quantum physics,which shows that at a subatomic level, matter is empty, and at its heart liepatterns of energy. The irony here is that by acknowledging geometry as thefundamental basis of matter, science has adopted the stance taken by ancientcultures, elevating these supposed “stone-wielding, loin-cloth primitives” toits highest ranks.Little wonder, then, that these harmonic laws were so important to the templebuilders: they are the laws behind the Universe. And since the Universe wascreated by God, they reasoned that to embed the harmonic ratios governing thetemporal movement of the heavens into these physical structures, the power andthe knowledge of the firmament could be bestowed upon the Earth. So, templesbecame doorways into the mechanics of the physical world and the inner world ofconsciousness, and the interface would enable anyone to connect with finerlevels of awareness.Today, as alienation from all forms of spiritual and Universal wonder reachesepidemic proportions, expressions of sacred geometry and symbols bearing thehallmarks of an ancient philosophy of harmony are manifesting in our fields.Even skeptics will admit that crop circle designs exhibit a harmony pleasing tothe eye much like an ancient temple or classical painting. The proportions arebalanced, the shapes rhythmic, the symbols dynamic; even an outlying grapeshotappears to stand like a sentinel at its remote location by premeditated design.By analyzing crop circles in accordance with the laws of sacred geometry and itsmany expressions, one begins to appreciate the mastermind behind theirconception.Image [images/p176-01.jpg]Circle: In crop circle designs, then, we see recurring geometrical shapes thatare for the most part generated from a central circular form and which developproportionally by outward expansion, a regenerative principle fundamental toorganic life. The circle is representative of the Creator's principle, of cosmiclife, from the smallest atom to the largest planet. It has no beginning and noend; all things are divided from within it and, paradoxically, all things arecontained within it. It is expressed by all cultures past and present as thesymbol of the unknowable, of spirit, and the “breath” of the Universe. It isalso the foundation of the entire crop circle enigma; even the “Koch fractal,”with its expanding hexagonal mosaics, begins as a large central circle ofclockwise-spiraled plants.Image [images/p177-01.jpg]Square: If the circle is symbolic of Heaven, the square represents matter andEarth. The Maya, for example, regarded the Earth as a living organisminextricably interconnected with humanity; and in Mayan cosmogony, Hunab Hu isthe creator of measurement, movement, and the mathematical structuring of theUniverse. This divinity was represented by a square inside a circle, whichsignified the ether surrounding the four elements of air, water, fire, andearth. A crop version of this appeared at Etchilhampton in 1996.Image [images/p177-02.jpg]Figure 10.4 “Grid Square.” Etchilhampton, 1996.Image [images/p177-03.jpg]Squared Circle: When square and circle are given equal areas and superimposed,they represent the fusion between spirit and matter, or harmony on Earth. Theproportions of the squared circle were used, for example, as the traditionalfoundation of the Indian temple and cities based on cosmological principles.Image [images/p177-04.jpg]Figure 10.5 The squared circle, traditional plan of the Indian cosmic temple.Wherwell, 1995.Image [images/p177-05.jpg]Vesica Piscis: The overlapping of two equal circles births a figure of profoundsymbolism called the vesica piscis. It is emblematic of the world above andbelow, of the conjunction of spirit and matter. The figure is associated withJesus Christ and the Piscean Age; hence the vesica's correspondence to theChristian fish and the shape of the bishop's mitre. The Holy of Holies, itcarries the number 2368 in gematria (a number also equated with Jesus Christ)(Michell 1988a). Gothic architecture uses it in the distinctive ogive arch; andin 1996, it appeared as a crop circle near Weyland's Smithy long barrow inWiltshire.Image [images/p178-01.jpg]Equilateral Triangle: From within the “womb” of the vesica piscis all theregular polygons of sacred geometry are born. The simplest is the equilateraltriangle, the form of completion, since it has a beginning, a middle, and anend, and as such is symbolic of strength and stability. Therefore, it is not byaccident that many of the most arresting symbols in religion, science, andcommerce are based on the triangle; the Trinity and the three colors thatgenerate the visible light spectrum are examples of two polarities held inbalance by a third.The triangle reigns in Christian iconography, God being the only figureportrayed with a triangular halo. The Creator's “blueprint” appearsthree-dimensionally as the tetrahedron, whose geometry underlies the moleculesof life as well as the best natural conductors of heat, quartz, and diamond.Hardly surprising that one of the most enduring crop circles, Barbury Castletetrahedron, represents this form.Image [images/p178-02.jpg]Spiral: The spiral is the measure of creative forces. The spiral of a galaxy aswell as the harmonics of Earth's living organisms are governed by a principlecalled the Golden Mean (or phi). Its proportional geometry is seen in the growthpatterns of leaves, nautilus shells, the ram's horn, and the bones of the humanhand. Its proportions are implicit to Greek and Egyptian temples, as well asGothic cathedrals, just as its elegant motion was portrayed in the “Triple JuliaSet” and the Woodborough Hill “sunflower” of 2000.Image [images/p178-03.jpg]Figure 10.6 Constructing a Golden Mean or phi spiral requires a geometricdivision in the ratio 1:1.6180339, a tall order on paper alone. The “sunflower”crop circle is composed of 44 such spirals, each one meeting at an angle of32.72°.Image [images/p179-01.jpg]Pentagram: The Golden Mean is extrapolated from the pentagon and the pentagram,the figures most associated with humanity, since the human figure withoutstretched limbs is contained within the five-pointed star. Hence it was thesymbol of the Pythagorean's humanistic science, and worn as a talisman of goodhealth. The pentagram pervades Native American symbolism, while Christiansassociate it with Jesus because the pentagram represents the archetypal human(five senses), the Christed human who has harnessed the occult forces of natureto attain sovereignty over the material world. The angle between two sides of apentagon is 108 degrees, and as 1080 is the lunar number in gematria, thepentagram's qualities are lunar, feminine, and intuitive (Michell 1988a).There are many examples of the pentagram as a crop formation symbol. One was theBourton “Star” whose deceptively simple design concealed complex proportionalgeometry. But just as a crop circle can contain geometry, so can geometrycontain a crop circle, and something in this pictogram at Alton Priors provokedstudious fascination (see figure 10.8 [20_chapter10.html#fig10.8]). What lookedto many to be nothing more than circles connected by a line was discerned byJohn Martineau as containing an invisible rhythm. In a visionary moment heobserved how its elements could be framed by invisible pentagrams. But was thisjust a coincidence? After all, anyone can draw a pentagram around a circle. Notso. The clues lay in the strategic position of the two small grapeshot whichgive the starting reference points. Later, I extended Martineau's work bydemonstrating that the geometry could be proportionally extended to encompassall aspects of the design.81Image [images/p179-02.jpg]Figure 10.7 Relationship of pentagonal geometry. “Star,” Bourton, 1996.Image [images/p179-03.jpg]Figure 10.8 Hidden pentagonal geometry of the Alton Priors pictogram, 1991.So what looked at first to be an ordinary crop circle provided hours of“intellectual and spiritual insight,” just as the scholars of old said it would.Image [images/p180-01.jpg]Hexagon: The natural division of the circle into six parts produces the hexagon,which contains the six-pointed star widely referred to as the Seal of Solomon.The hexagon's qualities are rational and solar, as governed by its 6 x 60°triangles, reflective of the solar number 666 in gematria, and not (asfundamentalist Christians will argue) the devil's license plate. Othercharacteristics and symbolism behind this figure are vast, so I will touch ononly a few significant facets here.The natural division of a circle allows six circles to fit exactly around thecircumference of an equal seventh. Twelve can also be fit around a thirteenth.John Michell has studied these implications and concludes: “It is symbolic ofthe order of the universe in the fact that twelve equal spheres can be placedaround a thirteenth so that each touches the nucleus and four of its neighbors,producing the geometer's image of twelve disciples grouped around the master.Christ, Osiris and Mohammed are among those who are represented as a centralsphere with twelve retainers” (Michell 1988a). Michell discovered furtherveneration for the Seal of Solomon in ancient cultures when he found the figureencoded in the ground plan of Stonehenge.Image [images/p180-02.jpg]Figure 10.9 Hexagonal geometry defines every element of this simple crop circle.The outer ring represents an imaginary circumference relative to its onlygrapeshot. This circumference defines the largest six-pointed star. UptonScudamore, 1990.The Circlemakers have shown a great deal of interest in hexagonal geometry,particularly in 1990 at Upton Scudamore, although the form was not apparent atfirst (see figure 10.9 [20_chapter10.html#fig10.9]). Martineau looked at thelonely dot, lying at precisely 30° to the magnetic axis of the formation, andwondered what would happen if he drew a line through the grapeshot at thatangle. To his surprise, the line bisected the two inner rings at points whereconstruction lines of a containing hexagon could be drawn.The points of the two six-pointed stars revealed how the Circlemakers usetangential geometry to marry an invisible matrix to the visible design,revealing why the satellites and the grapeshot are strategically located. As forthe grapeshot at Upton Scudamore, it also marked the path of an invisible outerring containing the entire formation and its hexagonal plan. This is hardly thesort of thing one would achieve by accident.To show how critical is the ratio between elements in crop circles, I dissecteda simple design. The 1987 formation at Whiteparish was one of the first circlesto incorporate a ring as well as a ruler-straight spur, as if suggesting “comelook at me.” As it turns out, both Martineau and I did, independently. Thesimplicity of the design hides a complex maze of hexagons and hexagrams. Butmore was to come.Image [images/p181-01.jpg]Figure 10.10 The simplicity of the Whiteparish formation, shown in gray,conceals a hexagonal framework (left) and the Drum of Shiva, which contains theproportional frequencies of the pure music scale.While looking for connections between crop circles and sound, I came upon theDrum of Shiva, a Hindu diagram of the pulsating instrument of creation. Its twoequilateral triangles touching point-to-point contain a collection of reciprocaltonal patterns which are found in the pure music scale. To generate theseratios, you need a hexagonal framework to place the points on the “drum” wherethe proportional ratios occur. By superimposing this figure over the Whiteparishcrop circle and its hexagonal framework, it is shown that the elementscorrespond with an inch-perfect alignment.82Ten years after Whiteparish, the importance of the hexagonal figure was againmade clear. After the end of the exhausting 1997 season, I was drawing theseason's pictograms from surveys and aerial photos. This time- andconcentration-intensive labor began to feel more like an initiation into theMysteries, but the procedure proved to have much merit. Out of forty reportedformations in Britain that year, thirteen hexagon-based formations hadmanifested—thirteen being the number of circles that fit inside a hexagon, andas such, an association with a mysterious Egyptian diagram.Image [images/p182-01.jpg]Figure 10.11 The outward expression of the circle in six movements (a) issynonymous with the days of creation. God's “day of rest” is expressed by thecomplete figure of seven circles (b). The next outward expression creates theSeed of Life (c). Within the Seed lies the Tree of Life (d). The next outwardexpression (e) creates the Egg of Life, which can be simplified thus (f). Thenext outward expression (g) creates the Flower of Life (h). Again, this can besimplified as six circles packed around a seventh (i). Within the Flower lie thethirteen circles of the Fruit of Life (j). Connecting the circles generatesMetatron's Cube (k) which contains all the geometric energy patterns necessaryto create the Platonic solids (l)—the Star Tetrahedron shown here. The Platonicsolids are fundamental bonding patterns forming the physical Universe.Image [images/U001.jpg]Image [images/U002.jpg]Image [images/U003.jpg]Image [images/U004.jpg]Image [images/U005.jpg]Image [images/U006.jpg]Image [images/U007.jpg]Image [images/U008.jpg]Image [images/U009.jpg]Image [images/U010.jpg]Image [images/U011.jpg]Image [images/U012.jpg]Image [images/U013.jpg]Image [images/U014.jpg]Image [images/U015.jpg]Image [images/U016.jpg]Image [images/U017.jpg]Image [images/U018.jpg]Image [images/U019.jpg]Image [images/U020.jpg]Image [images/U021.jpg]Image [images/U022.jpg]Image [images/U023.jpg]Image [images/U024.jpg]Image [images/U025.jpg]Image [images/U026.jpg]Image [images/U027.jpg]Flower of Life: To fully appreciate the importance the Egyptians attached tosacred geometry, consider that for them it was a prerequisite for generatingmathematics, from which they derived the laws of physics, even the morphogeneticstructure behind the physical world. It was the Universal code. This philosophywas attributed to Thoth,83 founder-god of Egyptian learning and measure, who“gave to the priests and philosophers of antiquity the secrets which have beenpreserved to this day in myth and legend. These allegories and emblematicfigures conceal the secret formulae for spiritual, mental, moral, and physicalregeneration commonly known as the Mystic Chemistry of the Soul. These sublimetruths were communicated to the initiates of the Mystery Schools, but wereconcealed from the profane” (Hall 1928).The Egyptian Mystery School's main emphasis was on an all-encompassing geometricsymbol called the Flower of Life, described in the Emerald Tablets of Thoth asthe infinite grid of creation. The Flower of Life (also called the Flower ofAmenti) is constructed from a circle divided into numerous repetitions of thevesica piscis. The process repeats sevenfold and rotates outward to create a“cell”; with every eighth division, a new outward expression begins and theprocess repeats ad infinitum, creating a matrix (see figure 10.11[20_chapter10.html#fig10.11]).Image [images/p183-01.jpg]Figure 10.12 The essential amino acids relative to the Flower of Life.Although it appears in two dimensions as a series of circles, the diagramactually represents a three dimensional process of spheres within spheres.Consequently, the process resembles the meiotic division of the human cell,making the Flower of Life a geometric metaphor for the unfolding process ofnature, a process referenced by the Seven Days of Creation in Genesis and theoctave of the music scale (whose significance will be shown in the nextchapter). As each of its “cells” contains the pattern of the whole matrix, theFlower also works like a hologram, and as such it is analogous to the Universe:Its branching patterns are said to describe the geometry of light interacting asgenetic material within the cells of the human body, the arrangement of thegenetic code within the DNA, even the branches within the essential amino acids(Braden 1993).Image [images/p183-02.jpg]Figure 10.13 Representation of a 3-D tube torus.Image [images/p184-01.jpg]Figure 10.14 “Seed of Life,” Froxfield, 1994; “Egg of Life,” Littlebury, 1996.The Flower's outward rotation is performed by the vortex action of thedoughnut-shaped tube torus, a shape fundamental to the generation andregeneration of matter, showing how energy flows into and out of itself—asimilar principle to the magnetic field that exists around the Earth and everyhuman being.In his pioneering body of work on the geometric origins of the Old Testament,Stan Tenen placed a 3-D tube torus within another primal shape, the tetrahedron,and from the combined structure uncovered twenty-seven primary symmetricalpositions from which he extracted the Hebrew alphabet exactly in the order theletters originated. Tenen also extrapolated the Greek and Arabic alphabets fromsimilar geometric matrices (Tenen 1992). It is now easy to appreciate why thesefigures are held to be sacred.The Flower of Life is the culmination of a number of outward rotations, and eachrotation is a form in itself. The first is the Seed of Life, and within it liesa series of circles connected with pathways, known to disciples of the Qabbalahas the Tree of Life. Hundreds of books have been devoted to explaining thissymbol, for in its understanding lies the point of spiritual balance for a humanbeing. The Tree's ten circles (each containing one of the first ten numbers)plus their twenty-two connecting branches are said to constitute the keys to allknowledge, the paths to wisdom. The diagram encodes a secret system such thatonly by arranging the paths in correct order are the mysteries of creationrevealed, a fact concealed in the 32nd Degree of Freemasonry (Hall 1932).84From the outward rotation of the Seed of Life comes the Egg of Life, a patternthat combines the harmonics of music with the electromagnetic spectrum andunderlies all structures in biological life. It is from the outward rotation ofthe Egg that the Flower of Life unfolds. The design has been found“flash-burned” onto the stone wall of the Osirion temple complex in Abydos,Egypt, by a process that nobody can explain; the temple is built with some ofthe hardest rocks on Earth. The design is referenced in an inscription on Tablet13 of The Emerald Tablets of Thoth as the life force code: “Deep in Earth'sheart lies the flower, the source of the Spirit that binds all in its form. Forknow ye that the Earth is living in body as thou art alive in thine own form.The Flower of Life is as thine own place of Spirit, and streams forth throughthe Earth as thine flows through thy form” (Doreal 1925).The wonder of the Flower of Life's rhythmic proportions is that it is possibleto draw the hexagon over the design at any point, thereby validating theimportance attached to this symbol by many ancient societies, and still visiblyretained within the Jewish religion. In fact, the Flower of Life was consideredso important by illuminated societies like the Cathars and Knights Templars thatthey sacrificed their lives by the thousands to the Roman Catholic Inquisitionrather than see its knowledge misused. This is hardly surprising, given that theFlower may contain the mathematical sequences of the code of creation (Braden1993).Embedded in the Flower of Life lies the “Fruit of Life.” As the name implies, itis the sum and application of this knowledge as it manifests in physical form,and as such, carries within it thirteen systems of information governing thegeometric aspects underlying our reality (Melchizedek 1996; Essene and Kenyon1996).Five such systems emerge when connecting the centers of the spheres withstraight lines. This couples the regenerative, feminine nature of the flower(circular) with the masculine principle (straight line). The net product of thismarriage is “Metraton's Cube,” and from its hexagonal matrix emerge the PlatonicSolids, the five crystallizations of the creative thoughts of God, the verybonding patterns of nature (Frissell 1994).85Image [images/p185-01.jpg]Figure 10.15 Thirteen formations from 1997 and their relationship within theFlower of Life grid.What makes this discussion relevant to crop circles is the fact that a 350-footimage of the Seed of Life appeared in 1994, followed two years later by anenormous Egg of Life, executed with godly precision. It was as if someone werepriming us for something.Image [images/p186-01.jpg]Figure 10.16“Something” came to light in 1997 with the appearance of the “Tube Torus,”followed by the thirteen English formations based on hexagonal geometry. Itdawned on me that all these formations could be packed, interlocked, andsuperimposed over the grid of the Flower of Life. But where to begin?Energy coming to Earth enters anticlockwise, then upwells clockwise. You canfind this instruction carved on the stones of Neolithic chambers throughout theworld, although science had to wait some 8000 years before Russian physicistsdiscovered that natural anticlockwise rotating systems add energy, and clockwiserotations release it (Kozyrev 1968). It follows that if the crop patterns aregenerated in a two-stage process (first programmed from above, then fired frombelow), that the overlaying of each formation upon the Flower of Life gridshould be sequentially performed in a clockwise direction. With all designsplaced within this grid, all but one element appears out of alignment: one ofthe 96 grapeshot in the spiky fractal design in the center. In the diagram (seefigure 10.16 [20_chapter10.html#fig10.16]), this anomalous grapeshot isreferenced within the offset ring of an earlier formation. If this is acoincidence, someone took a lot of trouble to make it so.Image [images/p186-02.jpg]Figure 10.17 Left: The tetractys with the Ten Words of God connected to form acube and a hexagon; Right: As a crop glyph. Hakpen Hill, 1997.The Tetractys: That spiky triangle is itself based on another symbol of sacredgeometry, the tetractys. Although attributed to Pythagoras, the tetractys can betraced to the Hindus, and prior to them is a matter of conjecture. Like theFlower of Life, what is certain is the association of this figure with thecreative process.Theon of Smyrna, a renowned scholar in antiquity, declared that the ten dots ofthe tetractys represented the Ten Words of God. To Christians these “words”signified the Ten Commandments; to the Hebrews, the ten spheres of the Tree ofLife. However, the numeric symbolism of the tetractys also corresponds to theHindu model of nine cobras around Brahma, the Egyptian Grand Ennead around Atum,and the Qabbalistic nine legions of angels around the Hidden God.In the esoteric tradition, if one is inclined to follow the path ofillumination, the tetractys reveals the mysteries of Universal nature. This iswhat Pythagoras did, and he was duly rewarded by discovering that the figurecontains the music ratios 4:1 (double octave), 4:3 (the fourth), 3:2 (thefifth), and 2:1 (the octave)—the harmonics that govern creation. Thusenlightened as to these Universal forces and processes, Pythagoras extractedtheories concerning music and color from the tetractys: The top three dots hesaw as the three elements of Supreme white light,86 or the Godhead; theremaining seven dots to him represented the colors of the visible spectrum aswell as the intervals of the diatonic music scale.Some interesting things happen when you connect the dots of the tetractys. Apartfrom creating nine equilateral triangles, you also create a hexagonincorporating the six-pointed star, and a 2-D view of a cube; and by furtherbisecting the angles, you also produce the lattice grid necessary for theconstruction of the two “Koch Fractal” crop circles.Image [images/p187-01.jpg]The Heptagon: Unlike other geometrical figures, the seven-sided heptagon hasbeen elusive throughout the crop circle phenomenon. As of 2000, there wereexactly seven examples. But given that it is the only geometric shape whoseangles cannot be bisected to a whole number, it is hardly surprising. Each anglemeasures 51.428571. . . .° Why it should be the only polygon which cannot bedrawn mathematically perfect remains as mysterious as the philosophicalassociations surrounding the number seven itself.This number evokes the seven ages of man, the colors of the rainbow, the day Godrested, the number of orifices in the human head, the pillars of wisdom, thenumber of days that—multiplied by four—regulates both the female and the averageof the lunar cycles, the number of abominations, candles, cities, cleansings,continents, covenants, curses, degrees of wisdom, eunuchs, gables, generations,heavens, loaves, mysteries, sins, steps, temples, veils, virtues, wonders, andso on. Seven trumpeters circled the walls of Jericho seven times, just aspilgrims to Mecca walk around the Ka'aba in seven spirals. Seven is balance,hence why Libra, the seventh sign of the zodiac, is the union of the spiritualthree with the elemental four, immaculately demonstrated by the square base andtriangular elevation of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, whose base angle,incidentally, measures approximately 51°51'.87Most importantly, particularly in light of our investigation, the heptagon isanalogous to the seven notes comprising the diatonic music scale, which we'lldiscuss later in this chapter.The Barbury Castle tetrahedron makes for an unusual example of seven-sidedgeometry, primarily because it is triangular. As coincidences go, the heptagonalconnection took me exactly seven years from the date of its appearance touncover. A numerical clue lay in the seven segments that makes up theodd-looking ratchet sitting on the bottom right of the glyph. But somehow theheptagonal geometry just wouldn't fit over the glyph. What I needed was astarting point.One thing that always stood out from the otherwise meticulous design of thisglyph was the way in which one of the arms of the triangle was kinked. Irecalled an obscure fact from the weavers of Persian carpets, who leave oneelement imperfect when they create their masterpieces because “only God isperfect.” Were the Circlemakers demonstrating their humility? Perhaps. But whydoes the kink lie opposite the ratchet? I decided to use the kink to project adiameter toward the ratchet, and use its seventh segment as the edge of acircumference. With this, a heptagon could be made to fit the crop glyph (seefigure 10.18 [20_chapter10.html#fig10.18]).Image [images/p188-01.jpg]Figure 10.18 Hidden geometry of the Barbury Castle tetrahedron—pentagonal,hexagonal, and heptagonal. Note the kink at point C.What is unusual about the Barbury Castle tetrahedron—and, as we shall see, a fewother “special” crop glyphs—is the way in which it encodes two additional formsof sacred geometry, namely the pentagram and the hexagon. The key to theconcealed pentagram lies in the glyph's lower left ball whose thin avenuepenetrates exactly five twelfths of the way. From the diagram, you can see how apentagonal star aligned on this ball frames the glyph's central circle and outerring with great precision. As for the hexagon, this is numerically referenced bythe top ball and its six segments. Here, a series of three nested hexagons eachreference the glyph's central circle and rings.Such a 5:6:7 relationship is significant in that five represents the geometry oforganic life, and six the geometry of non-organic things. Together, 5:6represents the ratio of the retrograde procession cycle of Earth relative to thecircumference of its equator in nautical miles, and by this harmonic, life isable to exist here. Seven represents the geometry of the soul, a key with whichconsciousness imprints the physical body (Myers and Percy 1999). This process ofcreative manifestation will have great implications in later chapters.In June 1995, a formation bearing a different type of ratchet design appeared atCow Down. Here we see how the zigzag pattern is clearly defined by an invisibleheptagonal geometry that defines the outer ring (see figure 10.19[20_chapter10.html#fig10.19]). However, the central points of the heptagonappear not to reference the middle ring of the formation, normally not a goodindication. Yet the two small, inner heptagons clearly define the rest of thedesign with ease. Like its predecessor at Barbury Castle, this design puzzledme, and again I initially looked for one element that appeared deliberatelyoffset, but with no luck.A couple of years later I came across a photograph of the same formation takenfrom a different angle. The group of three grapeshot were shown to be clearlyaligned to something else. But what? The middle grapeshot, visibly smaller thanits two sisters, suggested the focus of interest lay in the middle ring of theformation itself.The geometric relationship between outer and middle rings was a perfectequilateral triangle. The significance of this is that the ratio between thesetwo areas produces the mathematical ratio of 4:1, a double octave. If a straightline is drawn through the axis of the grapeshot, a contact point is made betweenthe triangle and the outer heptagon, suggesting that a connection exists betweenmusical ratios (the heptagon) and light (the triangle) in the circle-makingprocess.In all, there were seven elements in the Cow Down crop circle, just as thezigzag occupied a seventh portion of the surface area. Seven days after itsappearance a 90° deviation from magnetic north was observed on a compass placedat the center of the formation. Such are the coincidences involved in thisphenomenon.But 1998 was the year in which the heptagons showed up en masse, the mostunderstated of which appeared at the base of the hill fort of Danebury Ring. Forme this pattern remains one of the most perfect examples of the Circlemakers'art, not only for its elegant demonstration of a complex geometry, but theeloquence and simplicity with which it was achieved. The ratio of the area ofthe circumference running through the semi-circles relative to the circumferencemarking the outer edge of the formation is precisely 2:1, an octave.Image [images/p189-01.jpg]Figure 10.19 Heptagonal geometry. Cow Down, 1995.Image [images/p189-02.jpg]Figure 10.20 An area defined by an equilateral triangle gives a ratio of 4:1, adouble octave in music. Its contact point with the heptagon is at point A.Image [images/p190-01.jpg]Figure 10.21 Heptagonal crop circle shows a second relationship governed by aperfect square. This creates a ratio of 2:1, an octave in music. Danebury, 1998.To carry the musical coincidence further, an electromagnetic energy line runsthrough this area, connecting the Danebury crop circle and hill fort with achurch two miles away at Middle Wallop, former home of the London PhilharmonicOrchestra's prominent composer/conductor, the late Leopold Stokowski.Image [images/p190-02.jpg]The Octagon: When one comes face-toface with the eightfold figure that is theoctagon, one is essentially looking at the completion and rejuvenation of theUniversal cycle, as exemplified by the horizontal figure 8, the infinity symbol.“I am One that transforms into Two, I am Two that transforms into Four, I amFour that transforms into Eight. After this I am One again,” states the Egyptiancreation myth. I have already dealt with the Buddhist representation of thiscosmic cycle, the Wheel of Dharma and its eightfold path of enlightenment, andits related crop glyph. Another manifestation of eightfold geometry came duringthe 2000 season. In this crop glyph which appeared beside Silbury Hill we seethe octagon, and with it a suggestive relationship to Islam (see figure 10.22[20_chapter10.html#fig10.22]).In Islam, the highest pronounceable name of Allah is “The Compassionate,” andthrough His breath the Universe is periodically created, maintained, dissolved,and renewed. With the eight corners of the octagon unfolded, the exhalation orexpansion of the Breath of Creation is represented, and through the interplay ofthe polarities of breath, that form is manifested. This is why octagonalgeometry dominates Islamic culture.Similarly, the periodic table of elements is formed of groups repeating inpatterns of eight. Even the doubling of the human cell proceeds in eight stages,so not surprisingly the octagon is also an ancient symbol for the Earth Mother,who sometimes is depicted as an eight-legged spider manifesting the world whilespinning the threads of fate for humanity. Within this fate lies the choice forspiritual transformation. Was humanity at a point of periodic renewal when thiscrop circle appeared? Were we being invited to choose between repeating the samepatterns of behavior or treating Mother with more care and attention?Time will tell how we chose to respond to this pivotal moment, but traditionallythe leap to an eighth step brings spiritual elevation. For example, the lettersof the name Jesus add up to 888 in Greek gematria; eight represents the battlebetween the polarities of shadow and light, wisdom and ignorance. And eightfoldgeometry forms the foundation of the mystical temple of Shiva, the transformer.The octagon's 135° corner angles add up to 1080, the radius of the Moon, whoseeight major phases influence all the water on Earth, a point not lost on theChristian church whose octagonal baptismal fonts are used in the “purificationof the unconscious.”Image [images/p191-01.jpg]The Nonagon: In January 1999, I predicted that ninefold geometry would appear incrop circles for the first time. I lodged this information with three trustedpeople and the details were kept in complete confidence until the season wasover. And appear they did.Image [images/p191-02.jpg]Figure 10.22 The octagonal design in the foreground is visually misleading: itis actually two overlapping octagons, giving the edges a slight bowing effect.The formation in the background appeared the same night. Silbury, 2000.Technically, the nonagon or ennead lies outside the eight geometric expressionsof the Universe, but it is nevertheless an important figure since it identifiesthe limit reached by the regenerative principles of number, as shown by thetriangle and the tetractys. Composed of three trinities, it is the ultimateexpression of the triad and represents the highest achievement of any endeavor.Possibly this is why Thoth was regarded by the Greeks as Hermes Tresmigestus,“the thrice sacred,” and why to early Christians the nonagon was the Star of theHoly Spirit.Our latter-day cultural expressions still attest to the power of nine: happinessis being on cloud nine; a cat's lives are nine; amen, the end of prayer, isnumerically reduced to nine in Greek gematria. The gods, too, enjoy the nineassociation: Odin hid for nine days in the Yggdrasil tree before gaining wisdom;Demeter, goddess of fertility, is depicted with nine ears of wheat; the EgyptianGods of creation, the Neteru, were nine. No doubt they were aware that the tailof the human sperm half-cell consists of nine parallel tubes, and the embryo'sgestation time is nine months.Image [images/p192-01.jpg]Figure 10.23 Ninefold formation with six-moon vortex below Oldbury hill fort.Cherhill, 1999.When the ninefold crop circles began to appear, they did so in a variety ofguises. Three geometric examples are priceless in their harmonic hypnotism: thevortex of nine crescents at Hakpen Hill (see figure 7.22[16_chapter07.html#fig7.22] on page 104), the star and vortex at Cherhill, and astar formation below Sugar Hill (shown here). This last design is unique in thatit conceals virtually all sacred geometric forms which are not evident untildeciphered on computer.The Geometry of the Hoaxes: Having applied the rules of sacred geometry togenuine crop circles, it is only fair to test them on the hoaxes. Since themajority are of a kindergarten level of art, it is easy to pick out a few“gems.” Taking the hexagonal example at Oliver's Castle (the one surreptitiouslytrampled for that video scam), I applied a hexagonal framework based on thecenter circle and the six avenues. I already knew from ground observation thatsome of these were wildly off in their alignment. Seen from the air they faredno better, nor did the other elements of the design, few of which fit the basicgeometrical framework with any accuracy.Image [images/p192-02.jpg]Figure 10.24 With the flattened immature barley now risen, this 460-foot cropformation looks as if embossed. Sugar Hill, 1999.The ninety-foot flower, made for Arthur C. Clarke, shows the discrepanciesbetween design and desired result, demonstrating how a crop circle can bemimicked and how hard it is to achieve the high degree of symmetry of thegenuine ones (see figure 10.27 [20_chapter10.html#fig10.27]). TeamSatan/circlemakers were proud of their achievement at Milk Hill in 1998, so Idid them the courtesy of analyzing their ninefold pattern. For a group thatinsinuates they made the “Triple Julia Set,” the discrepancies in thiscomparatively simple, and three-times smaller, design are extensive. No wonderhoaxers regard the discovery of sacred geometry in crop circles to be“coincidental” and “insignificant.”Image [images/p193-01.jpg]Figure 10.25 Although outwardly a ninefold crop formation, the design encodes arange of hidden geometric relationships: (a) pentagonal; (b) hexagonal; (c)heptagonal; (d) ninefold; (e) twelvefold; (f) diatonic.Image [images/p193-02.jpg]Figure 10.26 Oliver's Castle hoax and its botched hexagonal geometry. 1996.In June 1995, I found myself flying above the Hampshire countryside strappedinto the seat of a tiny Cessna. Being 6'5” tall, I was having a tough timefitting my frame comfortably into the plane's. Inches beyond my kneecaps spun awelltraveled propeller, and 500 feet below lay the Litchfield “Torc” crop circlewith its bewitching bull's eye. But somehow, that wasn't what I was seeing. WhatI was looking at was music.Shortly after landing I drove to the crop formation with Colin Andrews. As wetrod the labyrinthine design I appreciated the rhythmic flow my feet felt atease to follow. Later when we retired to the pub to check the week's notes, Ishared my intuition that a musical thread seemed to run through the phenomenon.“Oh, you must get in touch with a good friend of mine when you return to theStates,” Andrews suggested. This good friend was professor Gerald Hawkins.I first met Professor Hawkins at the Cosmos Club in Washington, D.C. The epitomeof good manners and life-long scholarly dedication, Hawkins impressed me overlunch, and ever since, with his revolutionary discovery that certain cropcircles contained diatonic ratios. These are the mathematical laws that governthe Western music scale.Image [images/p194-01.jpg]Figure 10.27 Commissioned by Arthur C. Clarke: The geometry on the ground(white) clearly misses the harmonics required for the pentagonal format (black).Hakpen Hill, 1994.An astronomer by profession (he is the former chairman of the astronomydepartment at Boston University), Hawkins earned a degree in pure mathematicsfrom London University and wrote the groundbreaking books Stonehenge Decoded andBeyond Stonehenge which opened up a new field in archaeoastronomy. He possessesan inquiring mind and a precise eye for detail: He once noted that the star RhoGeminorum was missing when the galaxy was projected onto the Bostonplanetarium's ceiling. One would therefore be hard put to argue with hisobservations.Image [images/p194-02.jpg]Figure 10.28 Overlay shows the near-miss geometry in this hoax. Milk Hill, 1998.Hawkins' probe of crop circles was done with an open mind and analyticaldisposition, initially to see if there were similarities between theirgeometries and those of Stonehenge. Despite no immediate connections, the wholething had an air of mystery which tugged at his curiosity.In 1990, he sat down at his farm to read Circular Evidence and its meticulousrecord of ground observations and uncontaminated data. As he studied themeasurements, Hawkins recalls: “I discovered that the first formation in thebook was a ratio of 1:1, the next was a ratio of 3:2, the next 5:3 and 4:3. Isaid to my wife, Julia, ‘It looks like I'm tuning your harp. I'm getting aseries of diatonic ratios here.’”Image [images/p194-03.jpg]Figure 10.29 The octave and its corresponding mathematical ratios.Diatonic ratios are what musicologists refer to as the “perfect” intervals ofthe music scale—they are the white keys on a piano. Hawkins comments:A ratio in the diatonic scale is the step up in pitch from one note to theother. If you take the note C on the piano, for instance, then go up to the noteG, you've increased the frequency of the note (the number of vibrations persecond—its pitch) by 1-1/2 times. One and a half is 3/2. Each of the notes inthe perfect system has an exact ratio, that is, one single number divided byanother, finishing with 2, which would be C octave. The ratios were given by tworules—linear and square: For satellites, the ratio came from diameters, and forringed circles by areas or diameters squared [figure 10.31[20_chapter10.html#fig10.31]]. The creators seemed to know of these fractions,taking care to encode them in the shapes so that they could be retrieved bysomeone studying aerial photographs.Image [images/p195-01.jpg]Figure 10.30 The tangent theorem. Corhampton, 1988.Image [images/p195-02.jpg]Figure 10.31 Hawkins' Rule 1 (top), for spaced circles; and Rule 2, forconcentric circles.And sixteen out of twenty-five crop circles in Andrews and Delgado's book hadthese fractions. The chances of this happening by accident according to Hawkins'calculations are 1:400,000. Hawkins' discovery slammed the door on a list ofproposed causes since diatonic ratios are a human-invented response to sound.“The only place I can find diatonic ratios in nature,” he said, passing me abread roll, “are bird calls and the song of a whale. I don't think the birdsmade the circles, nor did the whales.”This spelled bad news for Doug and Dave, and for anyone else who had admitted tomaking all circles “for a laugh.” “If they did it for a laugh,” Hawkinsremarked, “then it doesn't fit with putting in such an esoteric piece ofinformation. I did write to them to ask why they put in the diatonic ratios.”“And what was the reply from these ‘men of average intelligence,’ as newspapersonce described them?” I asked.“Ha! they didn't reply.” He answered. “I think we can eliminate them. It's sodifficult to make a diatonic ratio, even more so in the dark. It has to be laidout accurately, to within a few inches with a fifty-foot circle, for example.”And by 1995, crop circles measuring up to 300 feet were containing diatonicratios to within a few inches of accuracy.Ironically, Lord Zuckerman, the former science advisor to the BritishGovernment, had suggested to Hawkins that in order to get scientists interestedin the crop circle phenomenon he should try to prove that crop circles were theproduct of the most palatable solution: human hoaxers. This proved to be a wisemove. By discovering that crop circles contain all manner of math, Hawkins hasinevitably raised the intellectual profile of those responsible, narrowing thefield of likely candidates to individuals who knew the math behind the musicalscale. That was until these observations prompted him to look for geometricalrelationships between the circles. Enter Euclid.Euclid was a Greek mathematician of the third century B.C. whose thirteen-booktreatise on mathematics established the basic rules and techniques of thegeometry that now bears his name. It is also pure geometry. Conversant withEuclid's theorems, Hawkins looked closely at the early crop circle patternsagain. The three triangularly-aligned circles at Corhampton, where the plantshad risen to forty-eight spokes, became his prime focus. Hawkins found that allthe circles could be touched by three tangents, creating an equilateraltriangle, and that by adding a large circle centered on one and passing throughthe other two, the ratio of the area of large-to-small was exactly 16:3.Image [images/p196-01.jpg]Figure 10.32 Hawkins' crop circle theorems are based on his studies of Euclideangeometry: (I) tangent theorem; (II) triangle theorem; (III) square theorem; (IV)hexagon theorem; (V) general theorem, where expanding and contracting concentriccircles give all the diatonic ratios.Hawkins had found the first crop circle theorem, and it was all based on firmEuclidean geometry. Encouraged, he applied the same rules to other designs thathad stood out and discovered three more theorems. The intellectual profile ofthe Circlemakers was rising by the day.“These are Euclidean theorems,” Hawkins remarked, “but they are not in Euclid'sbooks. I think he missed them, and I can show you a point in his long treatisewhere they should be—in Book 13, after proposition 12. There he had acomplicated triangle-circle theorem, and these would naturally follow. Onereason he missed them was he didn't know the value of pi, and probably was notcomfortable with the area of circles. Another reason why he missed them was thatwe are pretty sure that he didn't know the full set of perfect diatonic ratiosin 300 B.C.”This was significant because the crop circle theorems also contained diatonicratios as a natural byproduct of their geometry. The implication now was thatwhoever made the circles was intellectually on a par with, or superior to,Euclid.The reaction by the ever-skeptical scientific community to Hawkins' findings wasthat these theorems could easily be proved by bright, young high schoolstudents. “Proving a theorem is one thing, especially after you've been told,but creating one is altogether a much harder proposition,” Hawkins counters.Then almost by accident he discovered a fifth, more general theorem from whichall the others were derived.To demonstrate how hard it is to conceive of a mathematical theorem, in 1992Hawkins dangled this brain-numbing puzzle in front of the 267,000 worldwidereaders of Science News. The idea was to challenge scientists and mathematiciansto create, given the other four, this fifth theorem. None figured it out. Afurther challenge to readers of Mathematics Teacher proved equally fruitless.Then in 1995, a version of the theorem appeared, encoded into the Litchfield“Torc” crop circle.My fork looked lonely, having made few forays between plate and palate.Up to this point, Hawkins and I had been focusing on the accuracy of theCirclemakers and how their work was constructed with a tolerance of plus orminus one percent. But what about the error margin? Could the rules be reversedand still hit the same ratios? As a test, Hawkins had applied the linear rule toconcentric circles and the square rule to satellites; the diatonic ratios simplydisappeared statistically. This simple check shows that regardless of theassumptions, musical ratios do not easily occur in patterns.“There is a slight tendency for the measured diameters to cluster at unit valuesof meters,” Hawkins remarked. “This raises the question: Could the hoaxersstrike off the ratios 9:8, 5:4, 4:3, etc. at random by using a bar of fixedlength? The answer is no. Taking all the fractions made from the numbers between1 and 16, the nondiatonic ratio 7:4 should occur often by chance, but it isavoided in the data. Yet the 15:8 is found in the circles, even though it shouldoccur less often than 7:4 by chance. Then again we could expect black noteratios like 16:9, but none of these black notes were hit.”Image [images/p197-01.jpg]Figure 10.33 Copy of a drawing supposedly used by hoaxers to make the Froxfield“Seed of Life” glyph. Yet when given the Euclidean workout by Hawkins, thissimple compass exercise misses the ratios which were found in the 360-foot cropcircle.One case in point concerns the elegant Froxfield “Seed of Life” crop circle,rumored to be man-made. The sketch sent anonymously to the office of TheCereologist, allegedly signed by the leaders, Rod Dickinson (of TeamSatan/circlemakers) and a certain “Julian,” as the blueprint for the formation,is the standard elementary school compass exercise of placing six circles aroundthe edge of a seventh circle of equal size—but does not give a diatonic ratio(see figure 10.33 [20_chapter10.html#fig10.33]).But at Froxfield a critical discrepancy was found: the central circle wassmaller, having been reduced by a wide swath to generate, by geometry, the exactdiatonic ratio of 16/3. So were the hoaxers controlled by an unknown force thatnight, or was the sketch a hoax in itself? After all, the calculation would havebeen far easier to make on paper than in wheat.Image [images/p198-01.jpg]Figure 10.41 The remarkable coincidence between the shape of the “MandelbrotSet” crop glyph and cardioid stone circles of the British Isles (Castleriggshown here).Since Hawkins'work covered the early phase of this phenomenon, it was reassuringto discover—over the course of our food-free lunch—that the latter-day designs,now much more elaborate in nature and size, still yield diatonic ratios anddemonstrate Euclidean theorems.Up to this point, Hawkins had been working from accurate ground surveys,overlaying the geometries on aerial photographs shot at various angles. Thismethod left some room for skeptics to carp, so as I am versed in computerizedphoto correction, I offered to eliminate this problem. As if by luck, I hadalready shot “bull's eyes” of the most important formations before I realizedhow crucial a role they were to play. But then such are the coincidences . . .the examples in figures 10.34–10.40 (see pages A10 and A11 in the color section)offer a selection of Hawkins' discoveries as they correspond to the correctedcrop circle photographs.Now at the end of each season I have become accustomed to receiving a telephonecall from my good friend, albeit with some trepidation: If he sounds excited, itmeans he has found new ratios, which for me means days looking at pixels on acomputer screen. But this task has borne much good fruit. Hawkins' technique isto take a diameter from a photo and apply the unalterable rules of the theorems.In turn, I receive a set of precise measurements; they will either fit, or theywon't. I have yet to see one calculation of his that doesn't. This process ofphotogrammetry is useful in combing crop circles of later years for furtheradvanced mathematical evidence. As the designs become ever more stylized, it isnot immediately clear on the ground if any geometric information is present;only through the observation of aerial photos does the evidence reveal itself,much like the Nazca lines of Peru.One such example was the opening salvo of 1997. In this case, Hawkins found aperfect fit with his fourth theorem, as well as two diatonic ratios to anaccuracy of 0.1 percent. He also found evidence of Ptolemy's theorem of chords(from 150 A.D.), an historic landmark because it was the foundation oftrigonometry. Artistic as the Barbury Castle crop circle was, the patterncontains math, and to Hawkins' knowledge, no previous “artist” has usedmathematics as a theme. The closest example lies in prehistoric monuments suchas Stonehenge, which Hawkins has proved to be a complex astronomical calendar(Hawkins 1965).Although Hawkins didn't find the connection he'd set out to look for betweencrop circles and Stonehenge, it is the “Mandelbrot Set” crop circle88 that mayyet provide the link between crop circles and megalithic structures. Thecardioid shape, discovered in 1691 by Jacques Ozanam, is a remarkably good fitwith the groundplans of important Neolithic sites such as Castlerigg stonecircle in Cumbria and Ireland's Newgrange mound. Its crop circle twin was giventhe Euclidean workout by Hawkins and found to contain the diatonic ratios 5:2,2:1, 3:1, and 4:1.Image [images/p199-01.jpg]Figure 10.42 Hawkins' diatonic ratios as applied to the “Mandelbrot Set” cropcircle. The buds fit in equally spaced circles of Theorem V, from Euclideangeometry. The crop swirl begins at N.However, the 5:2 ratio is not found in the computerized version of theMandelbrot Set. Whoever made the cipher in the field deliberately placed theinformation inside a recognizable symbol, but artificially clipped the design bymoving the computer iteration origin (and indicated by the crop swirl), enablingthe 5:2 to be encoded. As it turns out, the Circlemakers also left out the fifthbud—perhaps because it was not diatonic!Sometimes I wonder if Gerald was ever aware of seventeenth century plantphysiologist Nehemiah Grew's quote: “From the contemplation of plants, men mightbe invited to Mathematical Enquirys.”Next time you're sitting by a lake, take a straight stick and dip it in thewater. Notice the stick appears to curve, yet you know for sure it is straight.You are experiencing the bending of light as it moves from a thin medium (air)into a denser medium (water); this is a simple analogy of how energy behaves asit moves from a rarefied state to a denser one.In the year 2000, a selection of crop glyphs pointed to a movement away fromEuclid's linear geometry, and seemed to introduce the concept offour-dimensional space, although several hints in this direction had alreadybeen dropped the year before. While it is beyond the scope of this book todiscuss 4-D physics in depth, I feel that by committing my understanding of thesubject to paper, other minds may feel drawn to take up the investigationfurther.In 4-D there exists no perspective, as we understand it. Objects are seen fromall sides at once. Obviously, the brain's capacity to comprehend such a conceptis limited, so to visualize 4-D space, the brain requires a kind of retraining.In the 1890s, C. H. Hinton wrote a number of books in which he set out severalexercises. One of these requires memorizing sets of colored cubes drawn indifferent positions, then visualizing them in different combinations. Hinton'sidea was to accustom the mind to perceive the Universe from a “whole-istic”point of view, rather than from a view based on “self.” The intended effect issimilar to the intent of mandalas: conditioning the mind to view things as theyare, and not as they're perceived. In so doing, physical limitations andpreconceptions such as up, down, right, left, front, and behind are dissolved.This technique also reinforces the Buddhist view that the physical world ismaya, an illusion, a projection onto the physical plane.Then, in 1915, Einstein's theory of relativity was extended to include gravity.This theory abolished the concepts of space and time as absolutes and proposedthat gravity is capable of distorting matter and energy: in essence, that spacearound large masses such as planets is actually curved. In such curved space,Euclidean geometry no longer applies, and a new type of geometry is required torepresent this curvature. Part of this insight can be found in the visualparadoxes of the early Greek mathematician Zeno, and in the abstractmathematical concepts of the nineteenth-century mathematician Georg Riemann(Feynman, et al. 1966; Capra 1986; Rucker 1985).Visual paradoxes, in which dimensional planes are both linear and circular,horizontal and vertical, are useful in training the visual cortex and the brainto more readily accept information in terms of the round and the spiral, the wayof nature; in other words, to process spatial information away from theperpetual rut in which it has become stuck: a world compressed into straightlines, flat planes, and right angles.This evolution in our dimensional perception is evident in art and the wayhumans have attempted to portray the world around them. You can see it in thelinear drawings of animals by cave dwellers, to the development oftwo-dimensional painting and false perspectives common to the Middle Ages, tothe more “realistic” portrayal of space following the Renaissance. Today we havethe capacity to construct credible 3-D images using holograms. Such adevelopment is not just representative of our cultural progress, but symptomaticof our changing awareness of the world around us, and the way the brain hasdeveloped the capacity to process information.Still, any attempt at describing 4-D space is at best an approximation. We arecreatures inhabiting a 3-D world, and lack the necessary translation device,even though elements of either dimension are inherent in each other: in otherwords, 4-D space is relative to 3-D just as 3-D is to 2-D is to 1-D (see figure10.43 [20_chapter10.html#fig10.43]).In 3-D we can judge the curvature of a sphere because we are capable ofperceiving its depth; however, if you try to represent this sphere on a 2-Dplane (a sheet of paper), you are essentially removing its depth, and the spherenow becomes a representation of a 3-D object on a 2-D plane. By further removingits illusion of depth, it becomes a plain 2-D circle; remove yet anotherdimension and this circle becomes a 1-D line. You can then take the analogyfurther by compressing the perspective of the line until it becomes a 0-D dot.Image [images/p201-01.jpg]Figure 10.43 Top: How a sphere is perceived on different dimensional planes.Bottom: Possible crop circle equivalents.Image [images/p201-02.jpg]Figure 10.44 4-D spheres penetrating our 3-D plane, such as a field of wheat,would be perceived by us as circles (dark areas).Using the same analogy, if someone were to place a 4-D sphere on Earth, we wouldonly see a representation of such—a circle (see figure 10.44[20_chapter10.html#fig10.44]). To convey the idea of depth, this circle wouldperhaps contain some visual device, like the shading used to make a circle looklike a sphere on a piece of paper. In Edwin Abbott's Flatland, the allegoricaltale describing different dimensional planes, he wrote: “Your country of TwoDimensions is not spacious enough to represent me [a sphere], a being of Three,but can only exhibit a slice or section of me, which is what you call a Circle”(Abbott 1983).Image [images/p202-01.jpg]Figure 10.45 Zeno's paradoxes: infinite plane represented on a square and on asphere, where the curving perspective is an illusion created by straight lines.By the same token, if a 4-D sphere were to penetrate our 3-D world, it wouldonly be perceived by us 3-Ders as a circle, and we would no doubt argue that itwas nothing more than that.If we handed a sphere to 2-D beings, they, too, would find the conceptinexplicable; either they would deny the existence of the sphere or, at best,label it as “mysterious.”This is not a far cry from the way we have up to this point perceived cropcircles.A sphere in 4-D is called a hypersphere. Its hypersurface is a curved 3-D spacelocated in 4-D space. One method of visualizing such a sphere is to draw aninfinite plane made with straight lines. By successively halving each area, theillusion of a diminishing perspective is achieved, slowly giving way to therealization that what we are looking at is now a sphere.I believe the “net” crop circle at Windmill Hill is trying to illustrate thisconcept.Over the course of his illustrious life, the Russian philosopher P. D. Ouspenskydiscussed the fourth dimension. He wrote:Either we possess a fourth dimension, i.e., we are beings of four dimensions, orwe possess only three dimensions and in that case do not exist at all. If thefourth dimension exists while we possess only three, it means that we have noreal existence, that we exist only in somebody's imagination and that all ourthoughts, feelings and experiences take place in the mind of some other higherbeing, who visualizes us. . . . If we do not want to agree with this we mustrecognize ourselves as beings of four dimensions. Do we not in sleep live in afantastic fairy kingdom where everything is capable of transformation, wherethere is no stability belonging to the physical world . . . where the mostimprobable things look simple and natural . . . where we talk with the dead, flyin the air, pass through walls, are drowned or burnt, die and remain alive(Ouspensky 1931)!Ouspensky also wrote extensively of the difficulties associated withrepresenting fourdimensional space in three dimensions. He said our perceptionof it, even if geometrical, is at best only a representation, and that thislevel of vibration is “inaccessible in a purely physical state.” In essence,Ouspensky considered that 4-D is a type of consciousness, and that the greaterpart of a human lives in 4-D but is only conscious of the physical 3-D part, aconcept not dissimilar to the teachings of Buddha: “All compounded things areimpermanent,” he said, and our suffering arises from our tenacity to cling topeople, ideas, and material goods, instead of accepting the transitional natureof reality. Therefore to be enlightened is to flow with, not resist, life. “Thepast, future, physical space . . . and individuals are nothing but names, formsof thought, words of common usage, merely superficial realities” (Murti 1955).These perceptions of the fourth dimensional plane offer us a new understandingof crop circles. First, the idea of a crop circle as merely a flat objectchanges considerably, for if it is a projection of a 4-D object into our 3-Dworld, what we see in a field is the flat, circular portion of an otherwiseinvisible but penetrating sphere. And as I demonstrated in chapter 8[18_chapter08.html#c8], this concept is more than idle conjecture. What's more,according to relativity theory, the distortions caused by a change in fourdimensional spatial relationships affect the flow of time, and as we alreadyknow, time behaves erratically in and around crop circles (see chapter 8[18_chapter08.html#c8] again).Second, for mystics such as Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, and Zoroaster, space andtime, if not the entire world, were accepted as an illusion, a construct of themind. By overcoming the bonds of the physical world (primarily gravity) thespirit is free to ascend to other planes of consciousness to achieveomniscience. These states are very similar to the descriptions in relativisticphysics of the space-time characteristics governing the four-dimensional plane.Image [images/p203-01.jpg]Figure 10.46 Examples of 4-D crop circles? (a) Windmill Hill, 2000; (b) EastKennett, 2000; (c) North Down, 2000.It would appear that not only are the Circlemakers asking us to question ourconcept of reality, they are preparing us to accept and develop a 4-D level ofbeing. If so, it is probably the next development in our evolution; after all,as a race we once believed we were inhabitants of a flat, two-dimensional planecalled Earth. Now we stand poised to observe our reality from another point ofview.Looking back at the unfolding of the crop circle phenomenon, it appears we havebeen following a program that progressively teaches us to see differently,circle to dumbbell to pictogram to 3-D glyphs to 4-D space. Such non-Euclideangeometrical expressions allow us freedom away from linearity and enable us tounderstand crop circles as teachings that expand our awareness, removing theboundaries we have imposed on reality, leading ultimately, I believe, to greaterconsciousness.No wonder considerable efforts are being undertaken to prevent people frombelieving in crop circles.79“As Above, So Below” is mentioned in the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas: “When youhave made the two as one, the internal as the external, the above as below, andthe male and female as one, so then will you enter the kingdom of God.”80By definition, occult is “that which is concealed from view,” just as esotericmeans “that which is hidden and lies within the individual.” The true date ofthe subduement of esotericism is a subtle matter, for its practice continued inpockets throughout Europe following the Inquisition, a genocide largelyconcocted between Philip of France and Pope Clement V during the thirteenth andfourteenth centuries. It is fair to say that its effects have contributed to themisunderstanding of esoteric knowledge.81See John Martineau's Crop Circle Geometry. I must point out that myintroduction to Martineau's brilliant work came after my own investigations,particularly as his books were (and continue to be) out of print. What isinteresting is that some of the early crop circles that I was drawn to analyzehad also been chosen by Martineau.82It also validates the hard work undertaken to accurately survey cropformations by Andrews, Delgado, John Langrish, and recently, the dedicated youngGerman Andreas Müller.83Pronounced Teh-ho-teh. Also written Djehuti, from which David is derived.Thoth was known to the Greeks as Hermes, from whence comes hermetic.84Qabbalah is an ancient system of theoretical and practical wisdom, a symbolicmap of creation, providing the student with paths or insights towards spiritualgrowth through the uncovering of hidden knowledge. One of the meanings ofQabbalah is found in the Portuguese word cavalo or horse, as maintained by theKnights Templars when they brought the wisdom of the Mysteries to Portugal. Itis said that when the student “mounts the horse” he embarks on a quest forknowledge and Universal truth. Interestingly, also derived from cavalo is theverb cavar, to dig below the surface, and cave (same English meaning, andsymbolic of the womb, of going within). In the West, the horse is the symbolicequivalent of the Sphinx, under which the lost Hall of Records is said to beburied, containing all the universal knowledge of Atlantis and other highcivilizations. Curiously, major concentrations of crop circles and UFO incidentsin England occur near hills marked with figures of horses carved out of thewhite chalk.85Interestingly, although named after Plato, another Greek sage, Pythagoras, hadused these same figures 200 years prior. Yet Pythagoras, along with other Greekscholars of his period, had been initiated in the Egyptian Mystery schools.Knowledge of the Platonic Solids appears to be far older, for stone models ofthese solids have been unearthed in Neolithic structures over 8000 years old,and as far north as Scotland.86The three elements of cyan, magenta, and green, from which all colors aregenerated, including white. This system is today used in television sets.87Gizeh (simplified as Giza in the West) derives from Djiseh or Jeesah, whichgives rise to the name Jesus (Elkington 2001).88Another level of understanding concerning the “Mandelbrot Set” crop circle isgiven by Myers and Percy."},{"pageContent":"11. ACOUSTICAL ALCHEMYIn the beginning there was the Brahman, with whom was the Word. And the word isBrahman.—The Rig VedaIn the beginning there was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word wasGod.—John 1:1If there is one point upon which both Eastern and Western religious traditionscan find common ground it is that sound was present at the beginning ofCreation. From the Popol Vuh to the Qur'an and the Bible, accounts of Godcreating matter through the utterance of a word form the cornerstones of everyfaith and cosmology.A word is essentially a vibration, and a vibration creates sound. From audiblesound emerges tone, a vibration of constant pitch. Since tones are part andparcel of the harmonic laws of sound frequency, is it possible that cropcircles, with their diatonic ratios and harmonic geometries, are expressions ofthese laws?As with sacred geometry, the laws of sound were paramount to the purposefulconduct of life throughout ancient civilizations. An appreciation of theimportance of sound in antiquity reveals how and why it is a prime ingredient inthe manifestation of crop circles today.When the Egyptians chose to depict the name of God and the creative Word, theydid so by encapsulating both in the hieroglyph of the mouth—in essence a vesicapiscis—a symbol similar to the shape a vibrating string makes. Just as the formsof sacred geometry emanate from the womb of the vesica piscis, so it is saidthat emerging from the one tone of creation were seven gods, such as theBiblical Elohim, each of whom was associated with a specific task in thecreation of the Universe.89 These gods were often depicted as rays emanatingfrom a triangle of white light, a principle echoed in diagrams such as thetetractys, where the threefold nature of white light gives birth to the sevencolors of the visible spectrum and the notes of the diatonic music scale.Image [images/p204-01.jpg]Figure 11.1 Audible sound takes on geometric order as it vibrates lycopodiumpowder on a steel plate. The forked figures at the center looks remarkably likethe OM symbol, as well as the tridents of Neptune and Shiva.Image [images/p205-01.jpg]Figure 11.2 Von Welling's seventeenth century alchemical drawing shows the sevenrays emerging from the primal tetrahedron or Holy Trinity. The heptagonrepresents the intervals of the pure music scale; the triangle, the threefoldnature of light. It is said that matter “descends” from these vibrations.Image [images/p205-02.jpg]Figure 11.3 Egyptian “mouth” hieroglyph.By 4000 B.C., geometry and sound were inextricably linked, at which time it wasalready established that the laws of geometry governed the mathematicalintervals that made up the music scale. This inseparable bond was certainlytaught in the Egyptian Mystery schools, since many of the temples associatedwith knowledge and transformation structurally encode the same harmonic ratiosfound in music (Schwaller de Lubicz 1977; West 1993). In fact, the relationshipof form and substance to tone was understood to such a degree that structuressuch as the colossal statues of Memnon used to emit an audible tone when struckby the rays of the rising Sun.The concepts of divine vibration were certainly understood in the East. Mentionthe term OM to many people today and they will sarcastically tell you that it'sthe sound bald incenseheads mutter when sitting cross-legged on Oriental rugs.But it is an altogether more serious matter to Hindus and Buddhists. For them,OM is the cosmic sound, the cause of all Universal matter, because it is,itself, the very source of matter.90 Hence the Hindu god Krishna was describedby his mother as containing the entire Universe in his mouth. Consequently,Hindu science and philosophy are based on this science of vibration, asexpressed by the phrase Nada Brahma (Sound God).Like all chants, OM generates geometric forms, and from these forms spring thoseelaborate geometric patterns called mandalas, which in turn are used as visualaids for meditators to access the mind's remote memory mechanism. Recentexperiments demonstrate how form arises from vibration: The five notes of thefinal chords of Handel's “Hallelujah Chorus,” when graphically charted as waveforms and superimposed over each other, create a pentagram.91Like the Hindus, the Chinese believed audible sound on Earth to be amanifestation of a super-physical vibration, an undertone prevailing in everycelestial object, what the Greeks would later call “the Harmony of the Spheres.”So it is not by accident that the Greek gods were referred to as akousmata, the“resonant ones.”Sound is considered to be a vibration of the air, but in the vacuum of space,sound is thought. As thought travels into Earth's material plane it isinfluenced by gravity and the denser layers of the atmosphere where it gainsmass—in other words, it physicalizes, taking on the acoustical characteristicsof sound as it does so. By this process the Word is said to “descend” fromheaven, to be “made flesh.”92Yet this is far more than an apt description of the creation of matter, for italso describes the descent of consciousness. When sound encounters physicalsubstances, such as sand, it manifests in geometric forms which, if you recallfrom the previous chapter, are an expression of consciousness. Sufi traditionhas a beautiful story of God imparting the relationship between sound andconsciousness to an attentive Moses on the wind-scarred crags of Mount Sinai:“Musa ke!” (“Moses hear!”), said God. Moses heard God say how He made Man out ofclay and then invited the soul to enter. A free spirit by nature, the soulfeared being tied down to such a dense and limiting vessel, and so refused toenter the physical body. So God asked the angels to sing, and with theirintoxicating melody the soul was guided to enter the body. Needless to say,Moses had a revelation of a Universe constructed by sound which he named musake,which today we take for granted as music.According to Ethiopian cosmology the first humans communicated only throughsound and song but gradually forgot the tune and resorted to words. Similarly,the Navajo mention times of old when shamans could speak onto sand and createpictures. Since this concept of sound or vibration was understood to be theprimary catalyst behind the Universe, ancient Mystery schools from theMediterranean to Tibet considered knowledge of sound to be a refined science,such that many of its teachers (Pythagoras being one) were often musicians aswell as priests.As in Tibet, legends from the Mayans and the Aztecs describe these ancientpeoples as scientists of sound, able to split massive stone slabs, dress some ofthe hardest rocks in geology with dexterity, and move them through the air withthe grace of a ballerina to position them with hairline precision. As LaurenceBlair writes: “Thus the vast and precisely laid temples of Uxmal and Machu Pichuwere raised and patterned—according to this legend—in symphonies of sound. Theirreligion recognized each individual as having a particular note or pitch” (Blair1975).That so many disparate cultures shared the same belief is in itselfself-substantiating evidence. Yet this ancient understanding of vibration isalso the view taking hold in the enlightened physics community today, which nowsees the invisible world of frequencies, rhythms, and magnetic fields as thefundamental principles behind reality. Twentieth-century data show that oursolar system is a harmonically interrelated musical instrument composed of morethan forty octaves—the frequency gap between audible sound and visible light.Image [images/p207-01.jpg]Figure 11.4 The Celestial Monochord, a sixteenth-century illustration describingthe relationship between planetary harmonics and the musical scale.Similarly, the Earth is modeled as a giant chord, each of its geological layerscorresponding to the primary major chord of the overtone scale, the natural tonescale of all music (Keyser 1970). In chemistry, oxygen, with its atomic numberof eight, represents the octave, while the nucleus of the oxygen atom iscomposed of twelve intervals, seven filled and five empty—exactly theconfiguration of white and black keys on a piano.Image [images/p208-01.jpg]Figure 11.5 The relationship of planetary and musical harmonics relative to thehuman body. This principle of rhythmic alternation, or ebb and flow, is inherentin the dance of Earth and Moon around the Sun, and was expressed in theLiddington crop glyph.In recent decades, German scientist Hans Keyser discovered how the relationshipsexpressed in the periodic table of elements (our understanding of the formationof matter) resemble the overtone structure in music (Blair 1975). WilfriedKrüger linked the tetractys to the structure of the atom by discovering anassociation between its musical intervals and the fundamental physicalingredients of organic life—nucleic acids (Krüger 1974). Finally, scientist andJesuit priest Andrew Gladzewski, after much painstaking research into theunderlying thread linking sound harmonics, atoms, plants, and crystals,concluded that “atoms are harmonic resonators” (Gladzewski 1951).While the basis of these relationships and correspondences may seem esoteric, itis expressed in the law of the octave, a mutual relationship between sound andcolor in which the notes of the octave correspond to the colors of the visiblespectrum. For example, the note “C” is matched with the color red at the bottomof the visible spectrum, because both require 24Hz to be sensed by the humanbody. Extreme violet (the note “B”), at the highest end of the scale, requiresabout 800 trillion Hz (Babbitt 1878; Hall 1928). Each octave is composed of aset of notes, and when one octave is completed another commences. The onlydifference is that every note now vibrates twice as fast as those in theprevious octave, and the process spirals into infinity. The law of dimensionsworks in the same way, each perceiving reality relative to its own narrowbandwidth. These planes of existence are interconnected by degrees of vibration,the most dense being matter (a common analogy is the way steam cools into waterthat freezes to ice). Since the human body is itself a set of atoms vibrating ata given frequency, our ability to consciously distinguish notes, colors, andother dimensions is limited, and like a radio station along the dial it onlydetects those vibrations which fall across its narrow bandwidth. One suchoccasion happened in 1985 inside the crop circle at Kimpton. . . .“God, if only You would give me a clue as to how these are created,” ColinAndrews beseeched the heavens that afternoon. The trilling sound the inquiringengineer received by way of a reply would later play havoc with some veryexpensive camera equipment, yet this hint by the Circlemakers fell on deaf ears,since no further progress was made at the time linking question with reply. Sixyears later, a new clue was dropped, this time in the form of a group of cropformations labeled by some as “Dolphinograms”—a vesica piscis with a radiatingring at each corner—a representation of the Egyptian hieroglyph “Divine Word”(see figure 11.6 [21_chapter11.html#fig11.6]).Image [images/p209-01.jpg]Figure 11.6 One of the “Dolphinograms.” Froxfield, 1990.In his extensive database Andrews had by now amassed several dozen accounts ofthis sound being heard prior to crop circles forming. One incidence occurredduring a nightwatch at the Wandsdyke earthworks near Silbury, when the trillingnoise was again caught on tape. Although the high-pitched sound had a beautifulchime-like quality, according to one of the people present, John Haddington,“This doesn't translate onto tape in true fashion, coming out covered by a harshcrackling, static-like noise which is presumably caused by the discharge of highenergy” (CPRI and CCCS databases, T. Wilson 1998).Other witness reports corroborate the sudden absence of the usual dawn chorus ofbirds and insects, replaced by a sonic emptiness before the trill rises involume, stopping immediately after the crop is laid down. The sound can playaural hide-and-seek with those present; it can move in nonlinear fashion andabruptly reposition itself a hundred yards away at the slightest intrusion from,say, a person entering a field or a car rounding a hill. This trilling tonetherefore, to quote Andrews, “exhibits qualities of behavior, has a possiblecomponent of psychic interaction, can emit at extremely high decibels, and hasthe ability to transmit on radio frequencies, interfering with electronicequipment. None of this is consistent with the abilities of birds” (Andrews andDelgado 1991).Or insects. To complicate matters, the Australian Aborigines have a soundsimilar to this unusual trill. During their ceremonies to contact their “skyspirits,” a bora (a specially shaped piece of wood) is attached to the end of along string and whirled, creating a noise practically identical to the cropcircle hum. A coincidence, surely? However, crop circles have been reported inAustralia as early as the early 1960s (T. Wilson 1998); their arrival was oftenlinked with the sighting of unusual flying objects, and many were placed nearsacred sites whose rocks were covered in petroglyphs which resembled early cropcircle designs.Image [images/p210-01.jpg]Figure 11.7 Harvested crop circle is governed by the relationship between the3-4-5 triangle and the Golden Mean, a formula that produces musical ratios.In cereologist folklore, the Circlemakers have shown an uncanny ability torespond to well-intended requests from those working close to them. No soonerhad I entertained the idea of sound as a possible causal factor of crop circlesthan clues started to appear in the fields. At St. Neots in 1996, not far fromthe site of the “Mandelbrot Set,” a crop circle was being harvested. The designwas simple, a large circle with a smaller one resting on its circumference.At first I didn't give it much thought, only noting that it looked harmonious.Then quite by chance I came across a diagram based upon mathematician A. E.Huntley's formula for combining two important figures: the “3-4-5” triangle andthe Golden Mean. The mathematical relationship between the two creates a diagramthat generates whole number ratios fundamental to the diatonic musical scale(see figure 11.7 [21_chapter11.html#fig11.7]).Within a month, two other glyphs appeared and also suggested a sound theme. Thefirst, at Stockbridge Down, contained a central ratchet feature similar to thelower right spiral of the Barbury Castle tetrahedron. It led me into two yearsof book-browsing and telephoning before a fascinating American researcher namedBarbara Hero met me after one of my lectures.Image [images/p211-01.jpg]Figure 11.8 “Ratchet” crop glyph. Stockbridge Down, 1995.Hero has worked with a diagram named the lambdoma for more than twenty-fiveyears. While possibly dating back to the Egyptian Mystery schools, the lambdomais also known as the “Pythagorean Table.” It is a diagram defining the exactrelationships between musical harmonics and mathematical ratios. By translatingsound frequencies in hertz relative to each musical interval into feet, acircular matrix containing all relative harmonic proportions can be constructed.Hero's simple formula is v = fw, which means velocity of sound in air at roomtemperature (v, approximately 1130 ft/sec.) = frequency (f, expressed in Hz) xwavelength (w, in feet, based on dimensions from the Grand Gallery of the GreatPyramid at Gizeh). As an example, a frequency of 34 Hz gives a wavelength of33.24 feet.93Image [images/p211-02.jpg]Figure 11.9 Pythagoras' circular lambdoma.On the lambdoma diagram, the darkened segments indicating each octave match theratchet of the Stockbridge crop circle, the latter providing further validationby its eight exterior circles suggestive of the octave.The potential of this explanation dangled enticingly before me like a presentwaiting to be unwrapped, when news reached me of a new formation at GoodworthClatford which had no identifying swirl (nor were its plants characteristicallybent). Instead, they were dipped just below the first node, some twelve inchesfrom the top (see figure 11.11 [21_chapter11.html#fig11.11] on page 213). Irecalled how the Circlemakers had created similar unhoaxable patterns in thepast as a means of getting people to pay particular attention, such as the threecircles at Corhampton which had led Gerald Hawkins to formulate his firsttheorem. Now here were 5,000 square feet of sturdy, immature barley embossedwith a type of rose emblem similar to a pattern familiar to the field of sonicpatterns called cymatics.Image [images/p212-01.jpg]Figure 11.10 Some of the figures generated by the voice of MargaretWatts-Hughes.In the 1770s, the Hungarian physicist Ernst Chladni earned the credit of beingthe first person in the modern era to show vibration in physical form, when hescattered sand on metal disks and watched the particles vibrate as a bow wasdrawn across the plates, much like on a violin. He called his experimentscymatics—the capturing of sound waves as they travel through physicalsubstances. Although Chladni made many careful drawings from his experiments,showing how the sand consistently realigned itself into geometric expressions,at the time not much fuss was made of these curiosities.94A century later in England, Margaret Watts-Hughes published the first of aseries of photos showing the same connection between sound and form. Her imageswere created by similarly placing a powder or liquid on a disk then letting itvibrate to the sound of a sustained musical note. Having experimented with asuccession of musical instruments, Hughes had the most successful results usingher voice. Again the particles arranged themselves into geometric shapes,gradually changing into flower patterns such as pansies, primroses, geraniums,and roses; in some cases the inimitable shape of a fern was created as well asthat of a tree. The patterns appeared to increase in complexity relative to therise in pitch, to the point where a powerful sustained note produced an imprintof a head of wheat. When the receiving medium was changed to liquids of greaterviscosity, a perfect daisy flowered on the disc.In the preface of Hughes' first book, Walter Besant prophetically wrote: “Let ushope that her work may be thought worthy of being taken up and conducted by someman of leading in the scientific world” (Watts-Hughes 1891).Half a century elapsed before Besant's “man of leading” materialized as Swissscientist Hans Jenny. In 1967, he published the first of his painstaking studiesof the vibrational effects on physical mediums such as water, powder, oil, andsand. He transmitted sound as frequencies through these media and photographedgeometrical and harmonic shapes forming as the wave patterns moved through eachsubstance.Jenny observed how changes in the vibrations (sound frequency) altered theshapes and geometry in the receiving medium. A low frequency produced a simplecentral circle encompassed by rings; a higher frequency increased the number ofconcentric rings. As the frequencies rose, so did the complexity of shapes, tothe point where tetrahedrons, mandalas, and images of the five Platonic Solidsappeared. Jenny succeeded in physicalizing sound, not only enabling us toobserve frozen music, but upholding the teachings of several dozen ancientcivilizations in the process. For my research, Jenny's experiments provided thevisual connection between crop circles and sound I had been searching for, sincemany of the vibrational patterns found in his photos appear in crop circledesigns (see figure 11.12 on page A12 in the color section).Some correspondences seem blatant, such as the circles and concentric ringstypical of the early 1980s, the tetrahedron at Barbury Castle, even the recenthighly structured hexagonal star fractals. Other images reveal the geometryencoded within crop circles that is visible only upon analysis of overhead shotsby computer. They also highlight the importance attached in antiquity to square,pentagonal, and hexagonal geometry.As a further demonstration, Jenny built a tonoscope to translate the human voiceinto visual patterns on a screen. As a test he had OM chanted into the device,whereupon it produced a circle which then changed into a triangle, sixpointedstar, then various pyramidal shapes as found in the Sri Yantra as the laststrains of the sacred syllable faded. The letter “O” when intoned alone produceda figure in the shape of an “O.”Image [images/p213-01.jpg]Figure 11.11 Cymatic pattern in barley. The plants are bent six inches from thetop. Goodworth Clatford, 1996.Such relationships between the geometrical forms of cymatics and the symbols ofsacred geometry demonstrate that the underlying order of both the physicalUniverse and the nature of consciousness are not abstractions of the human mindbut a real and structured matrix that binds everything together like God's glue.But there is one more important connection with crop circles: the relationshipbetween the rising complexity in Jenny's cymatic geometries in direct proportionto the rise of dispensed frequency also matches the historical sequentialdevelopment of crop circle designs, which grew exponentially from simple circlesinto today's complex pictograms. Therefore if frequency is determining (or is atleast part of) the spiraling intricacy of crop circles, that frequency must berising.In recent years Paul Vigay has undertaken experiments to gauge frequencydiscrepancies in and around crop circles. He walks up and down a field, takingstock of the level of background readings that his meters register and henotices how they abruptly change the moment he crosses a crop circle'sperimeter. Outside the Silbury “Koch fractal,” for example, background readingshovered in the midhundred MHz range, but once he was inside the perimeter, thereadings shot up to 260 MHz, reaching 320 MHz as he paced towards the center.95This was in 1997. When crop circles made a quantum leap in design complexity twoyears later, readings jumped to 540 MHz (compared to a general background rangeof around 150 MHz); in the “Nine Crescents” at Hakpen, Vigay detected a whopping650 MHz.Image [images/p214-01.jpg]Figure 11.13 Cymatic image relative to the Silbury “Koch fractal.”By 2000, crop circle design complexity surged once more, and so did thereadings. With the farmer restricting general access to the “Lotus” formationbelow Golden Ball Hill, this crop circle seemed like a good place for us tocarry out a detailed analysis. Vigay's equipment registered a steady 180 MHzbackground count on our approach, but this quickly climbed to 320 MHz as wereached the perimeter, suddenly shooting to 650 MHz as we stepped onto theformation's unusually agitated floor. When Vigay stopped and turned 90°, thereadings dropped to 170 MHz. At this point all alkaline batteries in ourequipment died; the lithium ones, however, remained unaffected. The games hadbegun.Image [images/p214-02.jpg]Figure 11.14 The first “Koch fractal.” Note how the central swirl abruptlyadopts a hexagonal pattern.We also noticed electromagnetic signal interference at an extraordinarily highrange of 1.5 GHz, the highest Vigay has ever picked up,96 yet minute 1Hzfrequency increments either side of 1.5 GHz produced a clear signal. Theinterference also manifested in a banding effect every six inches or so, as ifVigay were walking into ripples in an agitated pond. While this was going on, Iwas walking beside him holding two dowsing rods, registering an identical rippleeffect on the copper tools.The anomalies continued. All LCD displays, including a watch, began to darken,but when we rotated them 90° they lightened to normal. Clearly a polarizingeffect was taking place with the liquid crystal (silicon), perhaps because thefrequency was interfering with the limit of the material itself. One possibleconfirmation of this came when my camera's silicon-based circuit board got“fried.” So, just as Jenny found, the level of frequency appears to correlatewith the increase in design intricacy. Crop circles as residual imprints ofvibration now becomes a feasible proposition. But how would this work?Lying like a beached whale amid an evaporated bay, the massive chalk outcrop atEtchilhampton is conveniently ringed by two reservoirs and a well, so notsurprisingly it has been a breeding ground for all manner of crop circles. Ithas offered such delights as a “Solar Logos” and the “Grid Square.” However in1996, a strange glyph there evoked for me a Hindu connection. On one level, theglyph represented the root chakra; a second symbol representing the solar plexuschakra had appeared two days earlier, two miles to the north at Roundway.Sanskrit (like ancient Egyptian, Aramaic, Tibetan, Chinese, High Javanese, andHebrew) is a language held to be sacred because it was faithful to the Word ofGod, the “language of Light.” Hence its characters were considered “sounds ofLight.” Its syllables were believed to hold geometric vibrations that harnessthe powers of Light and the octaves of sound to create matter. Not surprisingly,altering the characteristics of this alphabet was a punishable offense. Indianclassical music, or raga, is claimed to be similarly endowed, and it uses thisquality to raise vibrations and lead one into heightened spiritual awareness. Soit is with experiments featuring such music that yield further clues about theway crop circles are formed.In 1969, her children having left the nest to go to college, Dorothy Retallackwas faced with the prospect of becoming a bored housewife, to which sheresponded by enrolling for a degree in music at Temple Buell College inColorado. Since the degree required an experiment in biology, Retallack wentabout proving the effect of music on plants. Of all her experiments, oneinvolving Led Zeppelin, Bach, and the celebrated Indian sitarist, Ravi Shankar,showed how plants leaned away from Led Zeppelin but moved toward the speakersduring Bach's preludes. But it was Shankar's sitar that had the greatest effect:the plants bent from the vertical toward the sound in excess of 60° (Tompkinsand Bird 1973), perhaps the closest any human has come at coaxing plants to lieclose to a right angle without damage.No doubt hoaxers will be taking to the fields with sitars now they've beenexposed to this.Similar results have been obtained for at least a century by Indian, American,and Russian agriculturists exposing plants to sound and its vibratory actions.Since the 1930s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has experimented with soundfrequencies to stimulate growth and health in crops. When agriculturalresearcher George Smith exposed corn to sound in the farming community ofNormal, Illinois, the result was a higher heat content in the soil as well as aslight burnt appearance in the plants. Interestingly, Retallack had found thatsuch frequencies also markedly affected the evaporation rate of water. These areconditions synonymous with crop circles. Thirty years before Levengood'sexperiments with microwaves, Smith speculated that sound energy also increasedmolecular activity in plants (ibid.).Experiments on wheat by T. C. Singh and the Indian Department of Agriculture in1958 used bursts of harmonious music for brief periods through loudspeakersinstalled in fields. This sprouted the seeds in one-third the normal time, andboosted crop yield by 61 percent, and, unbelievably, increased the plants'chromosome count.97 When Singh exposed his plants to Indian devotional songs,the number of stomata (surface pores) in the experimental plants was 66 percenthigher, the epidermal walls were thicker, and the palisade cells were longer andbroader than in control plants, sometimes by as much as 50 percent (Singh1962–63).A decade later in Canada, Pearl Weinberger found that exposing seeds to tenminutes of ultrasound during germination also stimulated increased growth(Tompkins and Bird 1973). Similar results were achieved using short bursts oflight (ibid.). This invites comparisons to the biophysical and microscopicalterations that were observed many times by Dr. Levengood as described inchapter 8 [18_chapter08.html#c8].We can now see that specifically directed energy in the form of sound is capableof affecting plants in the manner we observe in crop circles. But what type ofsound? After all, it is obvious that whatever medium is being used to bend thestalks not only applies firm and gentle pressure, but does so with a fine degreeof control.Ultrasound is capable of interacting with physical elements to an incredibledegree. Ultrasound is basically any frequency which lies above the limited humanauditory threshold of twenty kHz. It can be aimed, focused and reflected almostlike a light beam, and specific frequencies can be focused to cause certainkinds of molecules to vibrate while others nearby are left unmoved. In February1988, a report in the science section of the New York Times described how anultrasonic beam can make, break, or rearrange molecules and levitate objects.The higher the frequency of ultrasound, the greater its ability to be directedlike a laser beam. This requires readings in the high MHz range, the very onesdetected by Vigay. These extremely high frequencies are also of crucialsignificance because they ally with the human mind's own band of frequencies andare known to affect states of awareness (Hunt 1989). They are used in hospitalsto heal muscular ailments and bone fractures. Such healing effects aretraditionally associated with sacred sites of standing stone, particularly thosein the British Isles where ultrasound signals have been detected (Robins 1982).By contrast, the lower end of the human hearing range lies around thirty Hz.Below thirty Hz sound is not heard but felt, and at this end of the scale we aredealing with infrasound. Infrasonic frequencies interact directly withbiological processes, and when combined with high pressure—the acoustic powercreated at low frequencies can be in the order of kilowatts—they can producepermanent changes in any substances that happen to be in the way, straining themto the point of deformation, including disrupting of chromosomes (Brown andGordon 1967). Such effects are seen in plants connected with the circle-makingprocess. When people are involved, long-term exposure to infrasound causesharmful and unpleasant conditions such as fatigue and nausea, which areshort-term crop circle effects (see the next chapter).Infrasound is also capable of atomizing water molecules, creating a fine mistabove affected surfaces. In 1996, a farmer harvesting his field at Etchilhamptonsaw what he described as “a series of columns of mist rising like cannon shotfrom the field next door.” It was midafternoon on a dry, summer's day, and inthese conditions mist looks very out of place. A few hours later somethingequally out of place appeared: a series of thirteen crop circles connected by awinding, three-quarter-milelong avenue. Lying nearby was the “root chakra”Sanskrit glyph and its attendant teardrop. A decade earlier in 1985, a farmerand his gamekeeper, out at 6 A.M. checking their fields at Findon, West Sussex,saw a cloud of steam “rising like a series of fountains” from within a new cropcircle.Vaporization of water is crucial to the way crop circles are formed. In the caseof plants and their water-filled stems, sound waves are capable of travelingthrough the liquid like ripples, compressing and expanding it. Because of theaccompanying increase in pressure, the velocity of sound in liquid rises, and inthe case of water it is extremely rapid (specifically, 1,480 meters/second tothe power of minus one). This creates heat, tearing apart the water molecules,forming vapor, and creating a void inside the plants that collapses the areainstantaneously as the energy is released (Blitz 1971).This action, called vapor cavitation, creates local temperature increases of5000° K for a fraction of a second.98 This is enough to bend stems, particularlyaround the base, where the greatest concentration of water exists. Such extremeheating may explain the burn marks found on crop circle plants, as well as themissing water and usually dry soil. Recall how farmer Rennick in Saskatchewanfound such a situation in his crop circle along with a flattened porcupine? Itturns out that infrasonic vapor cavitation also creates extremely high pressuresequal to 500 atmospheres (Flint and Suslick 1991; Golubnichii, et al. 1979).Perhaps our flattened prickly friend gave up his life both to demonstrate andprove this process.The high heat potentially generated by infrasound is also evidenced by the lumpsof solid carbon sometimes found atop the soil, although it could be argued thatthese are simply the remnants of burnt stubble from a previous harvest. However,this would not explain rare cases where flies have been found flash-burned andstuck to crop circle plant stalks; nor a type of iron powder (some called itmeteoric dust) found glazed to the stems of a formation below Oldbury hill fortin 1993.Once again, no sooner had I begun to ponder the mechanism responsible for suchoccurrences when a stranger mailed me an article from an American physicsjournal, and again the finger pointed to infrasound. Laboratory experimentsexploiting the rapid heating and cooling of infrasonic cavitation to synthesizeamorphous iron show that the iron does not crystallize as it cools; instead, itforms an amorphous iron powder like a very soft ferromagnet (Suslick, et al.1991). When Levengood analyzed the curious substance from the crop circle itturned out to be amorphous iron whose magnetization had been sufficient for asmall horseshoe magnet to pick up the wheat heads and stems (Levengood and Burke1995).There's one more feature of these sonic frequencies that may help us understandthe nature of that other anomaly of crop circles, the tubes of light. Light andsound may seem incompatible at first; after all, unlike the transverseelectromagnetic waves that make up light, sound is an acoustic wave comprised ofnodes and antinodes (peaks and troughs) which travel longitudinally. Light isboth wave and particle, and since every particle is in a state of vibration, itsvery movement creates a sound.Conversely, sonic frequencies are known to create light. Laboratory experimentsshow that the high-intensity sound fields responsible for vapor cavitation arecapable of emitting visible light (Barber and Putterman 1991; Berthelot 1988).This sound-to-light process is called sonoluminescence, and it is thought to becaused by the production of electrical discharges as water vapor is ionized. Andthe lower the operating frequency, the greater the effect (Barber and Putterman1991).However, this may not be the only way to get light out of sound. JonathanGoldman, sound therapist and pioneer in the field of harmonics, was visiting atthe Palenque complex in Mexico when he was given access to a temple normally offlimits to the public. Inside a pitch-dark chamber deep inside the temple, he wasinstructed by his guide to tone the chamber with his voice.99 As he did so, thechamber became noticeably lighter, to the point where the outlines of the othermembers of Goldman's group could be seen (Goldman 1992).Certainly there exists a symbiotic relationship between sound and light. Asnoted earlier, the process of creation as represented by the tetractys requiresthe presence of both sound and light. In Egyptian cosmology, Atum Ra, the Sungod, is said to have created the Universe with a “cry of light.” In Greekphilosophy, logos, which means “word” and “sound,” constitutes the controllingprinciple of the Universe as manifested by speech.100 According to paleolinguistRichard Fester, the words logos, loud, light, and beginning are all derived fromthe primal root leg, and its mirror, regh. Therefore “light,” “sound,” and“beginning” fundamentally occur at the same moment (Fester 1981).Sound travels 40 octaves slower than visible light, and it travels fastestthrough copper, the prime material carrier of electricity. The “slowing down” oflight frequencies generates the colors of the visible spectrum, which in turncorrespond to notes in the music scale.101 Therefore, sound can be construed tobe the material carrier of light. This process is modeled by the “DNA” cropglyph. It features the two transverse waves or particles (electromagnetism,light) spinning around a longitudinal wave of sound (see figure 11.15[21_chapter11.html#fig11.15]); seen three-dimensionally, the sound wave appearsto travel within a spiraling tube. Essentially, the “DNA” crop glyph describesmuch of its own formative process, and perhaps that of the phenomenon of cropcircles itself.The irony here is that the “DNA” crop glyph was witnessed being programmed intothe field by a tube of intense white light. This “tube” is probably closer innature to a set of tightly packed spirals, which give the impression of a beam.“As the electron is transformed into quanta, it becomes a ray of light. Thepoint is transformed into a line, into a spiral, into a hollow cylinder”(Ouspensky 1931).Image [images/p219-01.jpg]Figure 11.15 Suggested representation of the tube of light that creates cropcircles. The wall of the tube is created by the transverse electromagnetic wave,as suggested by the “DNA” crop circle; within the tube flows a longitudinal waveof sound. The magnetic shielding is shown by the “Beltane Wheel” crop glyph (seechapter 8 [18_chapter08.html#c8]). The “ring torus” crop glyph depicts the 4°shift in the magnetic field, which gives the whole process a type of criticalrotation point.Image [images/p220-01.jpg]Figure 11.16 The Roundway crop glyph's relationship to Edwin Babbitt's chromaticcolor (light) spectrum. The glyph's design references the geometries of soundand light, containing as it does two heptagrams, Hawkins' Theorem II, and aconcealed triple trinity at the center.That this specific crop circle is a suggestive representation of the DNA spiralis no coincidence either. DNA depends on outside information for itsdevelopment; in other words, it needs information sent to Earth inelectromagnetic waves of light and acoustic waves of sound. According tobiologist Lyall Watson: “Light waves carry both energy and information. It is noaccident that the amount of energy contained in visible light is perfectlymatched to the energy needed to carry out most chemical reactions” (Watson1973).Because light is easier to focus into a tight beam, a higher percentage of itsphotons reach their intended target. As such, the higher frequencies of, say, alaser beam make it an excellent carrier of information. SETI astronomer DanWerthimer observes: “You can convey so much information in a laser signal—youcan send a whole encyclopedia in a second” (Savage 2001). And there is littledoubt that each crop circle conveys a library of information.If we now take the “DNA” crop formation and link it with others from that seasonwe find a beautiful thread (see figure 11.17 [21_chapter11.html#fig11.17]).Spiral motions of life (the “Julia Sets”); the relationship between soundfrequency and the electromagnetic spectrum (Littlebury “Egg of Life”); a vortexin a liquid medium (Girton); sound frequency in physical form (GoodworthClatford “cymatic”)—all are part of the ebb and flow of Universal energy asepitomized by the season finale at Liddington.It is interesting to note that the ground attracts infrasound and that males ofthe animal kingdom rumble low-frequency calls along the ground to warn otheranimals across long distances. On the other hand, ultrasound is aerial in natureand is used by the female species for communication (Vassilatos 1998; Payne1998). As such, both infrasound and ultrasound have the ability to carryinformation over long distances.However, since sound and light scatter as they pass through the Earth'satmosphere (dispersed by suspended particles and droplets of water), to protectthe integrity of an incoming beam filled with information, a shielding device isrequired. As hundreds of electronic devices have demonstrated when they cross acrop circle's perimeter, this shielding is definitely present. Further evidenceof a contained energy field is revealed in the lay of the plants, which showevidence of the same geometrically regular patterns of flow found inside anoscillating container (Parlenko 1933).This is where both the “Beltane Wheel” and the “Ring Torus” crop glyphs becomerelevant. If you recall from chapter 8 [18_chapter08.html#c8], the formersuggests a magnetization process and the latter an out-of-phase magnetic shift.Such a manipulation of the local magnetic field could theoretically be used toeither repel or contain energy—in other words, to create a shielding device.So it seems that the combined effects of sound, light, and magnetism explainmany aspects of the circle-making process and a large number of itspeculiarities.Laboratory and field studies in the twentieth century established that exposureto sound and electromagnetic frequencies creates beneficial and unusual effectson plants, while ongoing research into crop circle biophysics reveals unusualalterations and accelerated growth patterns. Through Jenny's groundbreaking workin cymatics, we have confirmation of the links between vibration, creation, andthe natural order of life, and their correlation to crop circle patterns. Suchpatterns collect along nodal lines, just as crop circles manifest upon theEarth's own nodal points.102Image [images/p221-01.jpg]Figure 11.17 Pivotal crop glyphs of 1996 conveying part of the process involvedin their manifestation: (a) Stonehenge; (b) Windmill Hill; (c) Littlebury; (d)Girton; (e) Goodworth Clatford; (f) Liddington; (g) Alton Barnes.So it is in the flattened crop that we are shown the pattern of frequency thatcreated it. Just as an oscilloscope transforms invisible vibrations into wavepatterns on a screen, each tone creating its characteristic image, so a field ofwheat is like Earth's oscilloscope, the crop circle being the sound pattern madevisible—the “Word made flesh.”Image [images/p222-01.jpg]Figure 11.18 Water in vibrating containers flows into regular geometric patternsin accordance to the shape of the container. A similar effect appears in the layof crop circles.Already conversant with discoveries by Russian, American, and Canadianscientists that ultrasonic frequencies noticeably affected the growth of plantsand seeds, Mary Measures and Pearl Weinberger experimented with audible sound atthe University of Ottawa in Canada.After four years of experiments on wheat, their team found accelerated growth.They postulated that the sound frequency produced a resonant effect in theplants' cells, thereby affecting their metabolism (Weinberger and Measuresn.d.). Which brings us full circle to Colin Andrews and his trilling sound atKimpton. At 5.0 kHz, the frequency Measures and Weinberger applied was virtuallyindistinguishable from the Kimpton trill at 5.2 kHz.Given their association with harmonics and biological processes, it may turn outthat crop circles are carriers of “codes” that can be put to practical, evenspiritual use. For a start, there already exists a rich legacy of sound in thehealing arts, particularly in the healing rituals and shamanic experiences ofancient cultures which were performed with sound or rhythm. Forty-six hundredyears ago the Egyptians were already using incantations to cure all manner ofailments, from infertility to insect bites (Dewhurst-Maddox 1993). In theclassical Greek era, the frequencies of flute music were used to ease the painof sciatica and gout; in fact, Apollo was considered the god of medicine andmusic. This practice continues with the Aborigines, who play the didjeridu overinfected areas of the body, healing wounds and broken bones with itscharacteristic tones. Modern medicine does the same today by applyingultrasound.Frequencies and rhythms form the foundation of nature, and because the Universeis in a state of vibration, by implication, so is the human body, whoseproportions and DNA are constructed according to the same laws of harmonicsfound in music. No wonder, then, that in his “Exhortation to the Greeks,”Clement of Alexandria likened the human body to a musical instrument. The body'sharmonic qualities are similarly acknowledged in a statement by Montanus ofPhrygia, a spiritual reformer of the second century A.D., through whom the HolySpirit was said to have stated: “Behold, man is like a lyre, and I fly over itlike a plectrum” (George 1995).Our predecessors clearly knew what they were doing when they used sound, andmodern science upholds their belief. Recent research in bioacoustics shows thata close relationship exists between the diatonic musical scale, the distancebetween the mean orbits of the planets, and the atomic weights of elements inthe human body. Consequently, the atomic scale, when converted into hertz, canbe administered as sound into an ailing body. People with eye problems, forexample, generally have high levels of iron in their system. Since iron has anatomic weight of 55, by subjecting the patient to a sound frequency of 55 Hz(also the note “A”), their iron level is balanced and their vision is cured(Beaumont 1999).Barbara Hero similarly considers sound to be an effective formula for healing,so much so that she has built a special keyboard whose notes are tuned to theharmonically related range of frequencies of Pythagoras' lambdoma. When thenotes are played, the body and its chakra system responds to the range ofintervals to a greater (and noticeable) degree than from a regularly tunedinstrument.103In England, Dr. Peter Guy Manners at Bretforton Hall Clinic pioneered cymatictherapy, adapting Jenny's principles and applying them to medical treatmentsthat work in harmony with the human body. Dr. Manners accepts that the body is acomplex array of harmonic frequencies, that cells in living tissue function asminute resonators susceptible to the effects of harmonic vibrations. Therefore,just as every organism requires harmonic frequencies to maintain its existence,harmonic frequencies are used to bring unhealthy systems back into equilibrium.This form of treatment has proved so successful since its inception in 1975 thatcymatic therapy clinics now operate around the world.Cymatics, the lambdoma, diatonic ratios, ultrasound—all the things found in cropcircles now found in healing? The inference alone is profound, and I expand onthis in the next chapter. Meanwhile, there is one final aspect of sound whichrelates to our understanding of crop circles: its impact on people and society.Human messages of faith, hope, and love are celebrated and carried fromgeneration to generation through song, so as a carrier of information, musicmakes a perfect vessel. A. E. Huntley observed: “Primordial racial memories arebrought to the surface more readily by music than by natural scenery or anyother art” (Huntley 1970). It is probable that this is the reason the shape ofthe human ear, and specifically the cochlea, is a spiral constructed accordingto the harmonic laws of tone, the same spiral ratio from which thousands of cropcircles have sprung.The importance of sound, in all its forms, is summed up by David Tame in hisprofound work The Secret Power of Music: “Music was not conceived by any [of theadvanced civilizations of antiquity] as it is conceived today, as being merelyan intangible art form of little practical significance. Rather, they affirmedmusic to be a tangible force which could be applied in order to create change .. . within the character of man.” Tame further observed: “Children all over theworld, when they first begin to speak or sing, do so in melodies based firmlyupon tonal intervals. These harmonic and melodic principles . . . seem to be byno means arbitrary or theoretical, but are naturally meaningful to the humanpsyche” (Tame 1984).Image [images/p224-01.jpg]Figure 11.19 A series of overlapping heptagons create the Tawsmead crop glyph.Infants actually recognize sound before they do color or form. When infantsspontaneously sing, the note intervals of their melodies correspond to thediatonic scale. This is an archetypal pattern around the world, indicating thatsome type of genetic element may exist in humans which allows them to identifythese laws of harmony—the same ones Hawkins has identified in crop circledesigns.Perhaps the encoding of these harmonics may be partly responsible for thetriggering of childlike behavior in people who spend a substantial amount oftime inside crop circles. Feelings of elatedness, exuberance, joy, and innocentwonder are all typical for visitors at these sites. It is as if crop circlesunlock a code in the human nervous system. Perhaps the answer is even simpler:music bypasses the brain's logical and analytical filters, and so connects moredirectly with the passions. The Egyptians knew this, as the hieroglyphs formusic, joy, and well-being are one and the same.This sudden triggering of emotional behavior is further amplified when studyingthe exposure to harmonic overtones. Robert Lewis, a student of the RosicrucianFellowship, writes: “The overtones of all musical sounds progress from thephysical world into the spiritual world. This is why music is practically alwayspart of religious services. Whether it be a Hindu mantra, the chant of a Jewishcantor, the call to prayer of a Moslem muezzin, a simple Christian hymn or aBach Cantata, the purpose of music in religious service is to raise thevibratory rate of a congregation upward through a series of overtones, to aspiritual level” (Lewis 1986).One serene August morning in 1998, I experienced this for myself when twocolleagues and I visited the hours-old heptagonal crop circle at Tawsmead Copse,not far from Alton Barnes. Against the stillness of the air, three highfrequencytones sounded in a continuous loop, audible enough for us to hum along with:F-GF-G-C. We scanned the empty countryside for an errant ice cream van to noavail. Puzzled, we recorded the tones on tape then thought nothing more of thiscuriosity.Back at my New Hampshire house, I came across a diagram known as the “Web ofAthena,” which demonstrates the heptagon's array of interconnecting lines andhow they are constructed from just three line lengths. My guitar, having satlonely and jilted in the corner all summer, was deputized into crop circlesresearch. I transposed the line lengths from the Web of Athena onto the ebonyfretboard and reproduced, note for note, the tones recorded in the crop circle.Image [images/p224-02.jpg]Figure 11.20 The three line lengths of the Web of Athena.And to think I learned to play guitar just to impress women! I might not havesucceeded in that endeavor, but now I began to see a connection between cropcircles and those other temples of the soul, sacred buildings. Celebrations tosacred geometry such as the magnificent Gothic cathedral of Chartres in Franceincorporate specific harmonic proportions in their design that enable thestructure to be used as a sonic temple; for example, to amplify the frequenciesin Gregorian plainchant (Charpentier 1975).Gregorian chants are rich in high frequency harmonics and produce effects on thebody since they charge the central nervous system and the cortex of the brain,as otolaryngologist Alfred Tomatis discovered during his forty-five years ofresearch. (Interestingly, the electron shell of the carbon atom produces thesame tone scale as the hexachord of Gregorian chant.) The role of music at theseplaces of veneration was to “release into the earth a form of cosmic energywhich could keep civilization in harmony with the heavens. Without suchactivities, it was thought, all could lose its alignment with the harmony of theuniverse, with catastrophic consequences” (Tame 1984).This effect applies to structures scattered across the Earth, from the Anasazikivas in Arizona, and the colossal Neolithic complex of Hagar Qim in Malta, tothe long barrows of Wiltshire and Dorset (many of which have folkloreassociating them with sound and increased states of awareness). Ultimately, theeffect of altering brainwave frequencies inside kiva or crop circle is that theperson and the sacred space become one and the same.Jonathan Goldman studied this intriguing interaction between sound frequency andsacred sites and suggested that the pineal gland in the skull can be stimulatedby vocal harmonics (Goldman 1992). The association between the pineal gland andclairvoyance can be traced back to the Egyptian Book of Coming Forth by Light(erroneously translated as “Book of the Dead”); throughout philosophical texts,the pineal gland is referred to as the “Eye of the Gods” or the “Eye of Shiva.”So when Egyptian kings chose to place a coiled serpent on their foreheads—at thesymbolic point of the “third eye”—it had much to do with their knowledge of, andinitiation into, the mysteries of consciousness.The pineal is described as a cone around which a cord is wound to make it spin,and by so doing, it creates a humming noise (Hall 1932), such as the kind ofnoise reported to be heard in the head by people who've spent a considerableamount of time inside crop circles, myself included. The pineal is sensitive tosound and long-wavelength light (Wiener 1968). Due to the presence of a tinyquantity of magnetite within the ethmoid bone in the skull, the pineal is one ofthe parts of the human body that is most stimulated by ultrasound and byfluctuations in the electromagnetic field. And it is already scientificallyestablished that energies in crop circles do stimulate the pineal (Pringle1999).Activation of the pineal is accomplished when high frequencies cause thefingerlike gland to vibrate at a rapid speed, like the flickering tongue of aserpent. When kundalini rises up the spine from the root chakra, it toostimulates this “finger” to stand poised like a cobra. This unblocks the passagebetween the ventricles of the brain and unites the chemical flow of energybetween left and right hemispheres, linking the subjective and objective statesof consciousness—the visible with the invisible (Hall 1932; Goldman 1992).As the pineal vibrates faster, it creates a kind of temporary shielding from thepull of gravity, offering consciousness a window through which to connect withthe fourth dimensional state. We often experience this liberating effect when wetravel to extraordinary and faraway places during sleep. This is why the pinealgland is referred to as the “all-seeing eye” and the “eye of Horus,” and whyanyone in a receptive state coming into contact with a sympathetic frequencyinside a crop circle will most likely experience altered states of awareness.The correct use of resonant harmonics as a means of elevating awareness iscommon to many cultures. Aboriginal shamans use it like a key to open a gate todifferent planes of existence. To create these harmonics the Aborigines rely onthe didjeridu, a traditional musical instrument made from a termitehollowed limbof a tree. In Aboriginal folklore, this instrument was as a gift from theWandjina, a race of supernatural beings from the Dreamtime who were responsiblefor the creation of Earth.The sonic field produced by the didjeridu creates an interdimensional windowenabling contact between these beings and the Aborigines.104 This may sound like“primitive nonsense” to many in the West, and yet research into psychoacousticsshows sound is capable of “affecting the resonant fields within intercellularprocesses down into the genetic levels, even down into the atomic and subatomiclevels” (Essene and Kenyon 1996).Such insights provide an understanding of how the frequencies in crop circlesaffect humans consciously and subconsciously, particularly as the opening of awindow for the soul via the pineal gland can just as easily work the other way,allow it to receive information. Suggestive and rhythmic commands aimed atpeople while they listen to music is already an efficient method of absorbinginformation and knowledge. Coupled to ultrasonic frequencies, this technique canalter brainwave patterns, inducing the mind into a meditative and receptivestate (Tashev and Natan 1966).Sound penetrates and overcomes physical barriers. It makes every cell in thebody aware that a communication is taking place. Shaped into music, soundbecomes a messenger, a carrier for social change. Therefore, crop circles can belooked upon as tones from an unseen reality, self-referencing, their informationimparted to the listener through sound, audible or inaudible. Consequently, as aform of communication they are virtually infallible. As Victor Zuckerkandlwrote: “Tones must themselves create what they mean. Hence it is possible totranslate from one language into another, but not from one music to another”(Zuckerkandl 1956). If this is indeed the case, it is feasible the Circlemakersare sending messages that facilitate changes not just on an individual basis,but in our collective consciousness.“The end of all good music is to affect the soul,” remarked Monteverdi.Precisely the impression crop circles are leaving on all those whose antennaeare extended and receptive to their transmissions.89El is a general Phoenician term for a god; Elohim are best described as “lightgods.” There are many Els, each associated with a particular creative principle.For instance, the four guardian angels of Earth are: Uri-el (earth/humanity),Mika-el (fire/strength/protection), Rafa-el (air/healing), Gabri-el(water/communication). Both sound and Elohim are attributed the same gematrianvalue of 86.90OM is reflected in the Egyptian amun, later adapted by the Christian faith asamen. The frequency of OM originates from the center or solar plexus chakra.Because Western faith has displaced its center too far upward, into the chestand the head, the vibration of amen fails to vibrate with the same effect.Consequently, this is seen as the core of weakness in Western religions (Berendt1991).91The research was conducted at Delawarr Laboratories, Oxfordshire, UK.92Language is an imitation of sounds heard in nature, each word holding thepattern of energy of that which is imitated. Resonance is the transfer of thatenergy. For example, the samurai's fighting cry kiai induces in the opponent acatatonic fear, creating partial paralysis which reduces blood pressure. Thisdemonstrates the importance of words and names, and why the power of charms andspells should not be taken lightly (Andrews 1966).93Personal communication with Barbara Hero. For further information see her bookLambdoma Unveiled.94Chladni's work has since been used to demonstrate wave functions in physics.In a latter-day re-creation of his experiments, a 30 Hz sound frequencyemanating from the Crab Nebula, recorded by the Jodrell Bank radio telescope inEngland, was played onto a metal plate covered with fine sand. The vibratingsand recreated the pattern of the galaxy that had generated the near-infrasonicsignal.95Personal communication with Paul Vigay. Details in Enigma magazine, issue 15,Portsmouth U.K., 1998, p.8. www.cropcircleresearch.com[http://www.cropcircleresearch.com]961.5 GHz is the radio frequency emitted by hydrogen gas, the most abundantelement in the Universe. In the late 1950s, SETI (Search for ExtraterrestrialIntelligence, the agency featured in the late Carl Sagan's movie Contact)postulated that if an extraterrestrial source communicated with Earth, it woulddo so on this bandwidth. Astronomers and scientists involved with SETI havesince listened on this frequency for artificial signals from space.97Trilling and droning sounds, some bordering on the ultrasonic, pervaded CleyHill and the Warminster area in the summers of 1965 and 1973, creating phenomenawhere local plant life grew to extraordinary heights, some up to ten times therate of normal growth. These sounds were accompanied by reports of strangelights in the sky, and debilitation of motor vehicles and other electricalequipment. The Cley Hill area also has a rich history of crop circles. Furtherreferences to accelerated plant growth as a result of sound or electromagneticfrequencies can be found in the work of L. George Lawrence, Pearl Weinberger,and T. C. Singh, to name a few.98(See Levi 1991 and Putterman 1995) For this information I am indebted toChristopher Baer, of Coral Gables, FL, who lives a few miles from Coral Castle,an extraordinary structure created by the mysterious Latvian, Edward Leedskilin,who cut, dressed, and levitated into place massive blocks of coral using sound.99Toning is a technique performed with intent in sacred sites, where one personor a group of people sing tones which resonate with the local environment. Theidea is to purify or activate the site. Chanting the OM inside a long barrow isan example of toning in a chamber.100The Greek logos stems from the Arabic lauh, meaning “tablet” (see RichardFester's Urworter der Menschbeit). It is interesting how the logos, the “word ofGod,” should have been written on “tablets” and handed to Moses (musa ke).101A law used by the ancient Chinese and introduced into Europe by Pythagoras.102The Earth is criss-crossed with lines of electromagnetic energy. The pointwhere two such lines cross is called a node (see next chapter). The theory thatcrop circles are visible prints of a light beam penetrating the Earth energygrid at its node points was, to the best of my knowledge, considered in 1988 bythe late George de Trafford, and only revealed to me in 2001. George's visionwas extraordinary, considering that the ideas proposed here were unpublishedduring his time. He also postulated that each circle corresponded to residualconsciousness, hence the designs have differentiating characteristics. Thisconcept is given further credence in chapter 13 [23_chapter13.html#c13].103The keyboard uses a software program written by Barbara Hero's colleagueRobert Miller Foulkrod. It is worth noting that the Western music scale has beenaltered during the past 300 years. A slight change in the frequency of a note byas little as 10 Hz has a fundamental effect on the body. For instance, duringWorld War II the American military raised the frequency of songs played to thearmed forces to increase heartbeat and productivity, and sharpen concentration(Hero 1992).104The art of multiphonic singing by Tibetan monks produces frequencies similarto Gregorian chants and the didjeridu. The One Voice chord, in particular, richin harmonic overtones, is said to embody the spirit of masculine and feminineelements of the divine creative spirit, and its sound unites those chanting itwith Universal consciousness."},{"pageContent":"12. THE DRAGON AWAKESWithout exception, every megalithic monument is in a certain relationship withsubterranean currents which pass, cross, or surround them.—Louis Merle and Charles Diot, archeologists, 1935Image [images/p228-01.jpg]Figure 12.1 Avebury stone circle, Europe's largest repository of Earth energies.Most of the hundreds of stones that originally made up its three rings and twosnaking avenues were destroyed by Puritans and fundamentalist religious fanaticsin the eighteenth century.The year 1969 saw the publication of The Pattern of the Past, an influentialbook by Guy Underwood investigating the presence of electromagnetic energypatterns at sacred sites. He wrote:[The energy's] main characteristics are that it appears to be generated withinthe Earth, and to cause wave motion perpendicular to Earth's surface; that ithas great penetrative power; that it affects the nerve cells of animals; that itforms spiral patterns; and is controlled by mathematical laws involvingprincipally the numbers three and seven. Until it can be otherwise identified, Ishall refer to it as the “earth-force.” It could be an unknown principle, but itseems more likely that it is an unrecognized effect of some already-establishedforce, such as magnetism or gravity. The earth-force manifests itself in linesof discontinuity, which I call “geodetic lines,” and which form a network on thesurface of the Earth. The lower animals instinctively perceive and use thelines, and their behavior is considerably affected by them. Man is similarlyaffected but less strongly, and cannot usually perceive lines without artificialassistance (Underwood 1973).Not surprisingly, Underwood's book created a resurgence of interest in theancient landscape. Underwood's geodetic lines105 are what the Chinese refer toas dragon paths or lung mei, the Aborigines as song-lines, and the Irish asfairy paths. Thorough investigations into Earth energies concludes that Britain,if not the entire globe, is crisscrossed with a network of “male” and “female”lines of energy (also termed positive and negative in terms of polarity)(Broadhurst and Miller 1992, 2000; Tersur 1993; Devereux 1992).The most important discovery at that time was that the thousands of stonecircles, obelisks, tumuli, henges, hill forts, long barrows, pagan worshipsites, and churches were deliberately sited upon the intersection points ofthese lines, called nodes.I learned from a British Army tank regiment sergeant that on occasion duringmaneuvers on Salisbury Plain, their compasses would deviate noticeably atparticular locations. These turned out to be on geodetic lines that connectednearby tumuli with local church mounds. And yet the general archaeologicalstance is that these earthen mounds are graves, sacrificial sites, or ancientmilitary fortifications. Considering that only 5 percent of excavated sites haveactually yielded skeletal remains, this view seems myopic. Like the Britishtumuli, many Egyptian pyramids have been labeled “tombs” even though no evidencesupports this. Only during the Saite period (663–525 B.C.) did it becomefashionable to build tombs in the shape of pyramids; in fact, recent evidencestrongly suggests that the Great Pyramid at Gizeh was a strategically sitedpower plant (Dunn 1998).106Image [images/p229-01.jpg]Figure 12.2 Earth energy organizes itself in various modes. The Hartmann Gridencircles the Earth like a net; geodetic lines vary in width and meander alongthe countryside linking sacred sites. The crossroads of these lines are callednodes. Energy organized as radials and concentric rings typically radiates fromnodes at sacred sites, churches, or crop circles.Image [images/p230-01.jpg]Figure 12.3 Radial energy pattern of Stonehenge, as of 1999.There is also the unsettling question of why people who supposedly lackedtechnological means sought to shape by hand some of the hardest stones known tohumanity, then to move these stones (weighing as much as fifty tons) acrossrelatively vast distances to bury dead relatives, sacrifice a goat, or preventtheir neighbors from stealing their wives.There is no doubt that throughout their lives—a span of time covering 12,000years—these sites were adopted for all manner of uses, depending on the need anddictum of the day. In my travels I have come across colossal dolmens used tohouse rabbits and sheep, but I doubt the original intention was to provide safeshelter for livestock. The monuments of men are not exempt from the ebb and flowof life, and such rhythm brings change: a Roman amphitheatre that once providedthe gruesome gladiatorial entertainment of lions and Christians fighting todayhosts a pop band; what is today a grandiose London hotel was once a hospitalcaring for soldiers injured in the First World War.Similarly, buildings on sacred sites were originally erected for other reasons.The etymology of “temple” signifies a division between sacred and profane space,suggesting that temples facilitated access from one plane to another. In theGizeh Pyramid, for example, the passageways are often deliberately set low,requiring the initiate to stoop in humility. In many Neolithic long barrows, thepassageway takes one westwards to “die” in the profane world, to be reborn inthe east, hence the original meaning of orientation.At Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, initiates would walk through St. Ann's door inthe west, indicating the setting of the Light and immersion in the dark forcesof chaos, then proceed towards the east and rebirth in the rising Light. Themajority of sacred sites (not to mention most Christian churches built uponthem) work in this manner, suggesting their original function was to be pointsof entry for the fertilizing power of the Heavens.Obviously, there's much more to ancient sites of veneration than meets the eye.By establishing a link between these doorways of energy (sometimes called dragonenergy) and the forces of transformation we can begin to answer the remainingriddles behind the crop circles, namely their deliberate placement near ancientsites, their energy anomalies, and their association with heightened states ofawareness. However, looking at what lies behind sacred sites—particularly theirmisuse during the past 1000 years—reveals why crop circles are causing suchconsternation among the authorities, religious orders notwithstanding.One of the earliest references to dragon energy appears in the first centuryA.D. in Decline of the Oracles by Plutarch, who refers to the streams ofterrestrial energy, influenced by the Sun and the celestial bodies, thatactivate oracles and places of invocation (Michell 1983). This energy wasrecognized by early Chinese geomancers as chi, its Christian equivalent beingthe Holy Spirit. Stone circles and barrows were erected at sites where thisenergy was concentrated, and consequently they were seen as places where healingor heightened states of awareness could be promoted in accordance withparticular phases of the lunar cycle and the equinoxes, when the energy is atits peak.In Timaeus, Plato shows that the geodetic force (particularly when manifested inspiral forms) is a catalyst in the construction of matter, and part of thegenerative power of Nature through which life comes into being and itsequilibrium is maintained. Consequently, animals in enclosed spaces when theyare about to give birth try to break out, to seek spots where energy up-wellsfrom the Earth.That such health-giving properties are instinctively recognized by animals isone reason why the spiral symbol has been held in sanctity, sometimes in theguise of a serpent or dragon, and why Aesculapius and Eileithyia (the gods ofmedicine and childbirth, respectively) were always associated with snakes(Underwood 1973). This concept is depicted in the Egyptian emblem of thecaduceus, its twin serpents entwined around a staff. This allegorical concept ofmegalithic man harnessing the beneficial powers of the Earth with a shaft ofstone is mimicked at Christianized sacred sites today in the image of St. Georgeskewering a luckless dragon.107Image [images/p232-01.jpg]Figure 12.5 The two snakes entwined around the spike, their male and femalepolarities harmonized beneath a winged Sun. Symbol of the fertilizing power ofthe Earth, the caduceus has since been borrowed by the conventional medicalprofession.Singular and erect, the phallic standing stone is the umbilical connectionbetween the energy of Heaven and Earth. This type of pillar in Portugal iscalled a betilo, stemming from the Semitic Beith-el meaning “house of God”(hence Beith-el-hem, the birthplace of Jesus). These stones, carefully chosenfor their high level of quartz (with its electrical and information storageproperties), were located at nodes where they could be magnetically charged.With these stones arranged geometrically, they created chambers with resonantacoustical properties, such as long barrows.108 Acoustical experiments in theCairn Euny stone chamber in Cornwall show concentric rings of resonance whosepositions are governed by Hawkins' square ratio for crop circles (Jahn,Devereux, and Ibitson 1996).Image [images/p232-02.jpg]Figure 12.6 The crossroads of Earth energies are marked by menhirs, dolmens,tumuli, barrows, or the Greek omphalos, demonstrating the importance of soundand its fertilizing influence upon the Earth. Since electromagnetic energy alsocongregates at these sites, the strategic positioning of these stones is likenedto acupuncture, an ancient method of tapping into the Life Force at 700 pointsthroughout the human body, using needles inserted at these points to correctimbalances of energy flow and hence cure disease. Outeiro, Portugal.Tests performed at Neolithic sites show that electromagnetic readings areunmistakably different within these sites, and that psychic ability is greatlyenhanced (just as it is in crop circles). The surrounding earthen embankments ofhill forts and stone circles provide shielding that reduces outsideelectromagnetic interference, allowing the individual “to tune in to stations wenormally tune out,” to quote Colin Wilson.109 Thus, information is received withgreater clarity and efficiency by the radio that is the human being and itsresonant antennae, the spine and DNA coil. The resonance found at sacred pointssuch as Delphi, Stonehenge, and the Pyramids is 7.8 Hz, and corresponds to thebrainwave frequency of mystics and healers (30Hz being the typical wakefulstate) (Becker and Selden 1985), proving that one of the grand purposes behindthese sites was to facilitate the mind into a state of receptivity. Hence whymany sites associated with transformation have the trident of el ayin inscribedon their stone walls, the same symbol that graces the head of that other sign oftransformation, the 1990 Alton Priors pictogram.Image [images/p233-01.jpg]Figure 12.7 Spirals etched at sacred sites throughout the world denote contactpoints between the physical world and finer levels of reality. Such sites areused to elevate awareness. The direction of the spiral indicates the centrifugalmovement of energy: anticlockwise descends; clockwise upwells from the Earth.The two are often seen in the contra-rotating swirls of crop circle floors.That organized religion knew and feared this ability of individuals to receivespiritual guidance at “pagan” sites is seen by the way it supplanted its ownstructures upon them, sometimes with little subtlety (see figure 12.8[22_chapter12.html#fig12.8]). During its laborious struggle to maintain controlof Europe, a dying Roman Empire created the Catholic Church, and through itsoffices issued many edicts which sought to eradicate pagan faith at megalithicsites and other oracles. As early as 640 A.D., the Bishop of Noyon warned: “Letno Christian place lights at the temples, or the stones, or at fountains, or attrees, or [stone] enclosures . . . let no one presume to make lustrations, or toenchant herbs, or to make flocks pass through a hollow of a tree or an apertureof the Earth; for by doing so he seems to consecrate them to the devil.”The work of the devil of course being any knowledge pursued outside the strictconfines of orthodox belief. Obviously the pagans did not share the RomanCatholic syndicate's opinion that use of sacred sites in any way connected themwith the forces of Hell, for 300 years later the clergy were still beinginstructed to “forbid well-worshipping and divinations with various trees andstones” (Thomas 1971).Image [images/p234-01.jpg]Figure 12.8 The subtle imposition of Roman Catholicism on an eightthousand-year-old pagan site of worship in Portugal. The adaptation of pagan sites becamea goal of the early Church as it sought to take power away from pagans (meaning“country dwellers”). In England, churches were even built in the middle of hillforts despite these being awkwardly located miles from their congregations.By the eleventh century, it seems the needle got stuck in the groove: “No one,”Pope Gregory reaffirmed, “shall go to trees, or wells, or stones, or enclosuresor anywhere else . . .” and so forth. In their desperation, the Church forcedwomen who cured their children at sacred sites to fast for three years; at onepoint it even became a criminal offense not to attend mass. And yet, as thesites of stone were proving so beneficial, orders for their destruction met withlimited success, so in a change of strategy the Church assimilated them, as aletter from Pope Gregory to St. Augustine shows: “By no means destroy thetemples of the idols belonging to the English, but only the idols which arefound in them; let alters [sic] be constructed, and relics placed in them”(Thomas 1971).These orders covered the length and breadth of Europe. But things became moresinister, for in its zeal the Church began to play down the connection of siteswith the unseen, as cited in the fatherly advice of the Bishop of Lamego,Portugal: “Be damned all who believe that the souls and bodies of men aresubject to the influence of the stars” (de Vasconcelos 1982). All this came fromthe same people who subsequently adopted the use of amulets and rosaries andthen claimed as their own the pagan rites of praise they condemned (deVasconcelos 1981). So much for the virtues of charity and tolerance extolled bythe early Roman Catholic church.110Inevitably, churches were built over existing “pagan” sites, in some casesassimilating the stones which had stood there undisturbed for thousands ofyears. The names of deities were corrupted: the god of purification and fire,Santan, became St. Anne; Morgana became Mary, and so forth. Yet the Churchcunningly maintained the connections with the old names since they were wellaware of the powers of invocation.111There is no doubt the Church knew of the inherent energy in the sacred sites andhow this energy enabled people to connect with higher levels of awareness, orGod. Its own seat of power, the Vatican, was itself built on a sacred sitemarked by a standing stone (Elkington 2001). And so, by introducing itself as anintermediary, organized religion removed direct contact between people and God.Which brings us up to crop circles in our present time.Given the ability of crop circles to connect people with the unseen and the wayin which the circle phenomenon is discredited, are we seeing history repeatitself, not to mention a possible motive behind the Vatican's allegedinvolvement in debunking crop circles (see chapter 5 [14_chapter05.html#c5])?Over two decades of research in England reveals that crop circles consistentlyappear on geodetic lines or their tributaries, influencing, charging, evenreconnecting the energy of local ancient sites as if reactivating a network of“sleeping” power points. In England the two principal “male” and “female”geodetic energy lines are called the Michael and Mary—so-called because of thepredominance of those two names in the churches along their paths. These linesextend from Hopton on the east coast in Norfolk, to St. Michael's Mount on thesouthwest coast of Cornwall, placing them in direct geographic alignment withthe path of the rising Sun on Beltane, or May 1.112 On their winding,cross-country trek, the lines pass through Avebury and Silbury Hill, the heartof crop circle country. When Paul Broadhurst and Hamish Miller were working onthe Michael and Mary thesis in 1988, they inadvertently stumbled upon the firstrash of crop circles around Silbury and discovered through dowsing that they alllay exactly on the course of female energy flow (Broadhurst and Miller 1992,2000).Dowsing is one of the earliest human arts, a 7,000-year-old profession prevalentin ancient cultures from the Mediterranean to China. In addition to findingunderground deposits of water, it has been used to locate minerals, people, evenmissing submarines. Before its use declined in Britain around the 1930s, dowsingwas a profession as common as carpentry, and dowsers would often be called uponto locate sites for wells or veins of minerals. Rosemary Grundy, a dowseremployed by the British Admiralty during World War II, map-dowsed enemy harborsfor ships worth bombing. According to the pilots who subsequently found thesetargets, her success rate was better than 75 percent. Later, in Vietnam, marinedivisions used dowsing rods to locate enemy tunnels, booby traps, and sunkenmortar shells (Ostrander and Schroeder 1976). Today it is used in the diagnosisof disease under the name radiesthesia, or sensitivity to radiations.Image [images/p236-01.jpg]Figure 12.9 A dowsing map of the “Coiled Serpent” shows how a crop circle'sphysical pattern manifests relative to an invisible energy grid. As withelectricity, such energies are composed of positive, negative, and groundpolarities. Here, the crop glyph has appeared along a geodetic line connectingan earlier glyph with tumuli, and another linking Silbury Hill with Picked Hill.A third line leads to a tumulus twenty miles away which later fired another cropcircle. This suggests that crop circles and sacred sites are “communicating”with each other.The most celebrated American dowser was Henry Gross, who from the comfort of hiskitchen table would dowse maps of Bermuda and locate sources of fresh water onan island where no such sources had previously been found. Subsequent drillingproved him right (Tompkins and Bird 1973). Scientific tests by Russiangeologists and hydrology engineers have also proved the human body's ability tolocate the unseen, the results published in the Russian peer-reviewed Journal ofElectricity in 1944. Up to the mid-1970s every major water and pipeline companyin America had a dowser on its payroll (Watson 1973), and although the oilindustry today still employs dowsers in an unofficial capacity to locateunderground deposits, like most modern commerce, it is embarrassed to admit it.Dowsing is a remote sensing ability. In principle, it works like this: themolecules of the human body, being electromagnetic in nature and composed ofalternating magnetic currents (Becker and Selden 1985), interact with externalwaves of electromagnetic energy. Such sensitivity to the Earth's electromagneticfield is verifiable with highly sensitive proton magnetometers (Tromp 1968).Using the conductivity of the water in the body and the iron in the blood, thesewaves trigger a muscle response in the nervous system that is transferred to adevice held in the hand, normally L-shaped copper rods, Y-shaped hazel twigs, orpendulums. The reaction causes a circular or linear motion in the device, themovement reflecting the answer to a specific question posed by the dowser. Inessence, the dowser is accessing information from the local morphogenicfield—like typing a word search into a computer to retrieve stored informationfrom an astral reference library.During the summer of 2000, dowsing was still very much in evidence, employed toestablish the provenance of two crop circles. The formations at East Kennettgave me the opportunity to do a comparative test: the first, the “4-D Cubes”formation, revealed several complex dowsing patterns; the second circle, bearingthe cliché heart-shape and circumscribed with a “string of pearls,” gave nodowsing response. Standing inside it and holding my copper rods I asked for theorigin of this crop circle. The answer was “flesh-and-bone humans.” Having runthrough the various names of known hoaxers, one name generated a response fromthe rods.Several days later I received a phone call from a colleague who is a friend ofthe local farmer. “I've been speaking to the farmer at East Kennett, and he toldme the heart formation was man-made with his permission. Apparently it was for awedding ceremony. You'll never guess who was behind the design.”Image [images/p237-01.jpg]Figure 12.10 Crop circle on the node of two crossing geodetic lines at theNeolithic complex of Windmill Hill. The polarities of the east-west line runningthrough the crop circle are the same as the polarities generated by the tumuli.“I have a fair idea,” I replied.“Rob Irving!”Precisely the name my rods had revealed.When I first began to dowse crop circles in 1995, I was walking in the footstepsof a few very experienced dowsers, giving me the benefit of their disciplineearly in my development. One of these teachers was the late David Tilt, a manwho spent the best part of two decades dowsing ancient sites around Sussex; hewas cognizant of the geodetic energies at these locales and how they radiatedlinear patterns or concentric rings.Image [images/p238-01.jpg]Figure 12.11 Dowsing plan showing twelve concentric rings of energy dowsedaround the menhir at Outeiro, Portugal, and how their positions are governed bygeometry. (a) Hawkins' square Theorem III; (b) pentagonal; (c) hexagonal.In 1983, Tilt discovered nineteen lines of energy emanating from the churchyardmound at Berwick, connecting it to nearby tumuli, long barrows, and other churchmounds. Four of the lines perfectly aligned with an adjacent stone circle,specifically on points where stones had previously been located. Since cropcircles were now turning up beside mounds in his part of the country, Tilt foundtheir appearance coincided with a release of energy from nearby mounds. Hecommented: “The energy-charge becomes so great that it overflows and dischargesitself. When this happens, air which is normally nonconducting becomes aconductor in the vicinity of the strong electrical field and carries the chargeaway from a number of places on the [radial] energy pattern” (Tilt 1992).Tilt's observation is consistent with data showing that the strongest ultrasonicreadings at stone circles occur between February and March (Robins 1982,1985)—appropriately just prior to a season's first explosion of crop circles;this signal dissipates to nil as the crop circle season gains momentum. Couldthe energy-rich sites be facilitating the crop circles? Or could the cropcircles be tapping into the geodetic grid?Tilt also noticed how crop circles had a tendency to appear at the geodeticnodes. This was still the case sixteen years later when my dowsing rods swungviolently inside the “Triple Julia Set” in reaction to the crossing of theMichael and Mary lines, as they met at this point on the Neolithic complex ofWindmill Hill.Coming across identical patterns is the lavishly-bearded dowser, Hamish Miller,who has developed his intuitive skills to such a fine degree that he is able todowse complex and close-knit patterns of discharged energy. The first time thisScottish engineer saw a crop circle he had such a deep recognition of the simplecircle-and-ring that it raised the hair on his back. On this auspiciousoccasion, he dowsed a series of ten invisible concentric rings, some as littleas half an inch apart, that defined the outer perimeter of the main circle;inside the ring, he found five more. Miller found the rings traveling upwards inlayers, detecting one 500 feet above the ground during an aerial reconnaissance.On occasion these thin rings are visible as dark concentric bands upon thedewladen seed heads at the break of dawn, particularly when backlit. This ispossibly the result of their heightened electromagnetic charge interacting withthe moisture, creating frozen ripples of music, as it were.With these ripples in mind, I traveled to an area abundant in undisturbedNeolithic sites in a remote part of eastern Portugal. One of the last places inEurope where people maintain a strong connection to the telluric grid, Portugal(the ancient Lusitania, the “land that holds the light”) has long been a safehaven for all peoples and races, offering tolerance for the persecuted and theunorthodox. With Avebury and Abu Simbel in Egypt, it forms a triangle of energy.Initially looking for similarities between Lusitanian monuments and theirBritish counterparts, I was surprised to still find them rich in dowsableconcentric energy rings, particularly the menhir at Outeiro, one of Europe'stallest. But there was something familiar about the relative areas of thesetwelve rings, a sense of prevailing harmony, just as Martineau had once seen theghost image of sacred geometry embedded within crop circles (see chapter 9[19_chapter09.html#c9]).Image [images/p239-01.jpg]Figure 12.12 The four concentric rings of energy dowsed outside the Beckhamptoncrop circle are generated by extending the pentagonal geometry of the physicaldesign.When I applied the rules of sacred geometry I found that the rings'relationships were governed by the pentagram and the hexagram. The biggestsurprise was that the rings containing the only anticlockwise motions of energywere governed by Gerald Hawkins' Theorem III (see figure 12.11[22_chapter12.html#fig12.11]). Encouraged, I applied the same analysis to othermenhirs and dolmens, and again found the rings were governed by Hawkins'theorems, sacred geometry, or both. I recalled Hamish Miller's early work andhow he had found energy fields in the centers of crop circles arranged asTeutonic crosses or as nine-, ten-, and twelve-pointed figures, and how he hadregarded these as “similar to the energy contour at points along the St. Michaelline where the male and female energies crossed each other at particularlysacred places” (Miller 1992).Image [images/p240-01.jpg]Figure 12.13 The overlapping heptagons of the Tawsmead crop circle define thelocation of its two exterior energy rings (left). The area of the rings isitself defined by the equilateral triangle of Hawkins' Theorem II, theequivalent of a double octave (right).On my return to England I retrieved my dowsing surveys of crop circles. One wasthe double pentagram at Beckhampton, where I had found four rings of energyencircling the formation. Could the same geometric correlation exist in a cropcircle? This indeed appears to be so. When the pentagrams of the visible cropformation are extended, their points clearly hit the circumference of everydowsed ring, showing that the rings of energy are harmonics of the visible cropdesign (see figure 12.12 [22_chapter12.html#fig12.12]).Was this a coincidence? To find out, I applied the same technique to anothersurvey, the Tawsmead Copse “Heptagon,” and found an identical relationship (seefigure 12.13 [22_chapter12.html#fig12.13]). These geometric relationships showthat the dowsing response is no accident. By the same token, the energy rings'geometric alignment suggests an effect similar to the overtones and undertonesof music, in which the ripples of harmonics are proportionally generated from asource note, and in this case that source note is the physical crop circlepattern itself. This led me to further revelations.In the opening crop formation of 1999 below Milk Hill (see figure 12.14[22_chapter12.html#fig12.14]), the ratios between concentric energy rings andthe crop formation again demonstrated Hawkins' theorems, as well as six-,seven-, nine-, and twelvefold geometry—quite a demonstration for such aninconspicuous pattern. Of these, the appearance of ninefold geometry was ofimportance to me since, as I mentioned earlier, I had predicted that type toprevail for the first time. When a complex ninefold star formation next appearedbelow Sugar Hill, it seemed as if my intuition had served me well. Furthervalidation was provided as the season progressed.Another surprise came when the physical elements of the crop glyph at Sugar Hillencoded the dowsed geometry of the earlier Milk Hill crop formation (see chapter10 [20_chapter10.html#c10], figure 10.25 [20_chapter10.html#fig10.25]). Givenhow I'd made the same discovery in 1997, I concluded that the first crop circleof the season embodies the code for the prevailing physical patterns.The concentric rings dowsed outside the Sugar Hill glyph revealed anothergeometric connection. The farther I paced away from the formation, the more theconcentric energy rings bunched up, each now barely an inch apart, before Ireached a wall of energy, as if the entire structure was housed in a dome.Plotting these rings on computer, the ratio of the energy field relative to theedge of the formation generated Hawkins' Theorem II, a double octave. I wasstanding within a dome of sound (see figure 12.15 [22_chapter12.html#fig12.15]).As each crop circle season reaches a crescendo, the concentric rings multiplyaround the circles, as if the Earth were oscillating wildly like a bell struckby a frenzied Quasimodo. More than 150 rings surrounded the “nine crescents” atHakpen Hill, while Roundway's “double heptagram” generated so many hundreds thatI gave up counting while still 100 feet away from its perimeter; in fact, withinseven minutes inside this formation I became disoriented and physically sick.Image [images/p241-01.jpg]Figure 12.14 Each of the five simple figures of this crop formation generate oneor two concentric rings of energy. In turn, the relationship between physicaldesign and energy yield an array of geometric shapes. Hawkins' Theorem III isevident in the thickness of the bottom ring. Milk Hill, 1999.Helping me to validate the discovery of these concentric rings of energy is PaulVigay, who often walks alongside me with his devices as we pace the tram lines,I with my dowsing rods. Whenever a ring triggers the rods to move, a discrepancyin hundreds of MHz appears on his gauge; these differences are either above orbelow the local readings.Such dowsable patterns in the crop circles can be influenced by harmonicvibrations, such as those generated by the sound of a harp played inside theMilk Hill pictogram (1990), that caused all the energy lines to expand (Bloy1992). I have measured identical effects following toning ceremonies at longbarrows and other sacred sites, in which the human voice is combined withintention to awaken the local “dragon.”The late Richard Andrews was a Wessex farmer who had worked with crop circlessince their early appearances in the late 1970s. He was a natural dowser. Hisapproach varied slightly to others' in that he dowsed the layer of energy threefeet above the ground and found that the energy flow at this layer is thereverse of that on the ground itself. Tilt and I independently validated thispoint, and we believe the layers of energy in crop circles flow in alternatingpolarities (positive/negative). This may explain why the plants in crop circlefloors are often found in layers of contraflow (see chapter 4[13_chapter04.html#c4]).Image [images/p242-01.jpg]Figure 12.15 Dowsing plan of the concentric rings of energy generated by theSugar Hill glyph. The relationship of energy to physical crop circle is governedby Hawkins' Theorem II, a double octave. Seen in 3-D (bottom), this energy isshaped like a dome, and extends above as well as below the ground.Andrews often took a witness with him to see the effects the energy was havingon his dowsing equipment. He handed the tools of his trade to his parish priestone day. The respected man of the cloth was amazed at the rods reacting to theenergy polarities, rotating like helicopter blades over the central vortexwithin the circle.Andrews discovered that the physical design of early crop circles was generatedwithin bands made up of three “straight” geodetic lines, and that crop circlefeatures such as boxes or rings manifested at the intersections of positivelycharged lines. He noticed how crossing lines of “whirlies” (lines ofexceptionally strong energy that can rotate dowsing rods) met near the center ofa formation and demarcated the cutoff points of the physical design.Andrews' ability to dowse a “master print” of energy encapsulating the physicalformation also showed that, despite the multiple energy patterns onsite, only aportion of this shows up as the crop circle. Even after all visible traces ofthe crop circle are gone, the dowsable and invisible fingerprint can linger forup to five years.Since formative forces of energy and matter tend to be spherical, at this pointit is worth reminding ourselves of the concept of 4-D space I mentioned inchapter 10 [20_chapter10.html#c10]. The physical shape of a crop circle may bepart of a larger picture, just as people with a finer degree of sensitivityclaim. The designs extend dimensionally above and below the ground and thephysical crop circle merely represents the flat plane of, by way of analogy, anorange that's been sliced in half.Image [images/p243-01.jpg]Figure 12.16 Detailed dowsing plan by Richard Andrews of the Chilcomb pictogram.The features of the crop circle are defined by positively charged geodeticlines. The four “boxes” are defined by a three-line ley consisting ofpositive/ground/positive polarities.They may have a point. Dowsers find that the crop circles' boundaries conform tostrictly delineated energy lines. Paul Vigay's electromagnetic frequencyreadings drop abruptly the moment he crosses the formation's wall. “Theelectromagnetic interference frequency inside the unusual ‘claw’ crop formationat Hakpen Hill (1994) went off the scale, but quickly dropped off six feetoutside the circle's perimeter,” he commented. No such discrepancies were foundin the nearby “crop circle” commissioned by Arthur C. Clarke. The case for the“shielding mechanism” of crop circles, described earlier, continues to build, inwhich a vertical tube defines the perimeter of the crop circle, or a dome as inthe case of the energy field around Sugar Hill glyph.In April 2000, a series of happenings lent further credence to this theory.Equipped with a perfectly functional camera, I flew in a small airplane over aset of new crop formations. One of these was the four-ringed, octagonalformation beside Silbury Hill. The Sun shone, the camera clicked, nothingunusual to report.When the negatives were developed, all images were exposed as normal, except fora row of nine frames in the middle which were blank. Either side of these, theimages show my approach to and departure from the Silbury Hill “octagon,” yetevery frame exposed directly above and within its airspace was blank.My camera technician looked blank, too. After several possible explanations, themost plausible was that the camera had crossed some type of barrier whoseelectromagnetic frequency had a temporary debilitating effect on the camera'scircuit board. News later reached me that another photographer had had anidentical experience, this time while flying over the airspace of the “StretchedNet” formation at Windmill Hill.Image [images/p244-01.jpg]Figure 12.18 When crop circles miss geodetic lines. Top: Man-made design atWhitchurch. Middle: crop circle placed beside Devil's Den only clips one of thedolmen's geodetic lines. Bottom: Examples of hoaxed crop circles that fail tohit nearby geodetic lines (Williams' hoax, center).Was the design itself trying to convey something? On closer inspection, Inoticed that one of the blank frames had actually captured a faint image; it wasso slight the photo lab hadn't bothered to print it. I returned to the camerashop and asked for a print. The developed “rainbow” image is all the morecurious because it's supposed to be an overhead view of a crop circle. (Seefigure 12.17 on page A12 in the color section.)When subsequent analysis of the negative by camera technicians and Kodakprovided no enlightenment, I took the image with me to a channeling session,during which it was revealed that the camera had captured the moment of openingof the energy field at Silbury Hill (I had not shown, or divulged any detailsconcerning the image or its location). The image, I was told, is essentially theenergy pattern—a life form—of the “guardian” of Silbury (described as an El, asin Elohim). “Unfortunately the process tends to fry little black boxes!”explained the channeled source.Since the human mind is capable of emitting pulses of electromagnetic energy, afocused group of people, even an individual, can add an energy pattern to aman-made crop circle—a technique I performed and measured inside a poorlyexecuted heptagram at Overton (for which the perpetrator, Matthew Williams, waslater prosecuted). It is important to note that unlike genuine crop circles,residual energy patterns of this nature do not conform to the physical design.No dowsing responses or electromagnetic disturbances are evident in man-madeformations, principally because they are rarely sited on energy lines, and neveron their nodes.Once the dowsing connection was made public, adventurous circle fakers beganattempting to align their creations in the vicinity of previous crop circles, orat locations historically known to be rich in geodetic lines, but in all casesthey missed the mark. For example, despite locating a well-constructed hexagonalpattern yards from the Devil's Den, the makers succeeded in only clipping theedge of the geodetic line running through that stone chamber.One of the better hoaxing efforts came in 1997 at Whitchurch in Hampshire. Whenyou cross the wall of a crop circle, it normally generates a response fromdowsing equipment, but on this occasion when I entered the formation, the rodssuspiciously overran the perimeter by a foot-and-a-half before reacting. Thedowsable pattern running through the formation was linear but made no referenceto its perimeter or physical design.113 When no other patterns manifested,including the node point, my suspicions rose.A look around the field revealed two old, isolated oak trees several hundredfeet away in the wheat field. This particular type of tree was traditionallyplanted by druids to mark the paths of geodetic lines; true to form, when Idowsed between the trees I found they were marking a twenty-four-foot-wide lineto which the hoaxed circle had been roughly aligned.A more convincing use of trees-as-markers occurred at the “Ant” formation.During a lull in sample collecting, I stood on the bend of each “leg” andnoticed how they precisely referenced a row of six almost-equidistant oakslining the field; a further two were referenced by the glyph's “antennae.”Before I could figure out why, a livid farmer named Will Butler came chargingdown the tram lines. After a brief, heated exchange, we learned that our teamhad been given permission to enter the field by a farm worker impersonating hisboss. Understanding this, Butler graciously allowed us to continue. Since one ofour functions is also to form ambassadorial bonds with farmers, we involved Willin our research and asked him if he knew the history of his patch of land. “Areyou aware that this crop circle lies directly on a ley line? You can see it upthere,” he said, pointing to the gaps between the oaks.Image [images/p245-01.jpg]Figure 12.19 “Ant” glyph. East Meon, 1997.The main geodetic line did in fact amble in from the east and ran through thecrop glyph. Since no other ancient markers could be seen from the valley floor,I marked the angles created by the “Ant's” limbs and later superimposed themover a geological survey map. To my surprise, the crop circle referenced twentysurviving tumuli, long barrows, and churches, even two previous crop circles,all within a five-mile radius. It was focusing the energy from local sites, andthis possibly explained the incredibly high readings we had been getting. Butleradded that his normally placid pets had been agitated the night the formationappeared, and that a military helicopter had reconnoitered the formation shortlyafter he discovered it at dawn.114Image [images/p246-01.jpg]Figure 12.20 The legs and body of the “Ant” reference no less than twenty-fourexisting barrows, tumuli, Neolithic sites, and chapels, plus two nearby cropcircles.When I correlated my findings from the “Ant” with Richard Andrews, he had thisto say: “The whole piece showed a very strong dowsable pattern, the mostinteresting part being the fact that the lines which started in the centerstopped at the end of each leg configuration and didn't go beyond that point.The other most interesting part was the pear-shaped component: across the baseof the two flat sides were two dowsable lines, cutting the configuration intothree sections, but not going beyond the outside edges.” Andrews also found thatthe energy grid across the field had modified its alignments to symmetricallyencompass the design; the crop formation acted as a vector of energy, drawingenergy into its body and releasing it in concentrated form through its tail.One key aspect of crop circle energy is that the geometric center and the energycenter are seldom the same. The latter lies off-center, usually marked by thespiral of the plant lay, above which one finds the active energy point. Thepolarity is predominantly neutral, and a dowsing instrument will demonstratethis. My experience shows three exceptions to this rule: the “Ant” produced fourenergy vortices arranged as an invisible square, four feet around the centralspiral, the vortices so agitated that pendulums had to be physically restrainedfrom becoming airborne; the Torus formation (1997) produced a still-point ofenergy 28 feet northeast of the physical center, over which swinging pendulumsrapidly became listless, as if sucked by the ground; lastly, the centers ofman-made formations produce no dowsing response unless suggested by the mind ofan inexperienced dowser.Thus it is established that crop circles are energetically linked to ancientsites, the Earth, and its magnetic grid.115 Despite the overwhelming evidence insupport of dowsing and its concordant results in crop circles, particularly as amethod of detecting their authenticity, it is not infallible. It must bestressed that dowsing is a discipline which requires a high degree ofconcentration, objective thinking, and, most important of all, practice. Manycrop circle enthusiasts dowse “genuine” results in formations which are thenexposed to be fake, exposing them to the ridicule of the media.It took Richard Andrews, for example, three years before he figured out how todowse crop circles. In his opinion, 90 percent of people dowsing crop circles donot know what they are dowsing or why they are getting the information; mosttroublesome is the problem of autosuggestion or letting their emotions orbeliefs get the better of them. “If you go into a crop circle believing it to bereal,” Andrews cautioned, “you will get all the answers you want, becausethey'll come from your own mind.”116Image [images/p247-01.jpg]Figure 12.21 Four vortices in the crop mark the crossing paths of geodeticlines. The east/west vortices are misaligned by approximately 10° and match thealignment of its respective energy line. Silbury Hill, 1999.That is good advice, to which I add: Begin your dowsing of a crop circle at theentrance to the field before your eyes can fool you. Or come to my lectures,where attendees report their dowsing rods react positively to pictures of cropcircles, yet when I show them hoaxes their rods do not move from their normal,at-rest position.Image [images/p248-01.jpg]Figure 12.22 Buildings such as Salisbury Cathedral were built according to theunderlying paths of geodetic energy thereby concealing the true purpose of theoriginal site. That the energy was of great importance is seen in the way thesemassive structures would often be erected on ground unsuitable for their weight.Salisbury Cathedral was built on a marsh.Since all living organisms—including the Earth—are electromagnetic by nature,and the presence of such energy in crop circles affects the environment, byimplication this energy must influence people who come into contact with cropcircles. Let's examine this idea.As we saw in chapter 10 [20_chapter10.html#c10], geometric shapes areessentially eddies of energy. By constructing an appropriate geometric shapeupon a strategic location of the Earth's magnetic grid, one can influence notonly the local magnetic field but the entire grid. One practitioner of this artwas John Dee, sixteenth-century philosopher, alchemist, astrologer, geographer,and appointee to the court of Elizabeth I of England. He reportedly dissipatedthe energy of an invading Spanish armada by building a structure comprising twooverlaid octagons on an energy node on the Isles of Scilly.The correspondence of a crop circle's physical pattern to the underlyinggeodetic current is reminiscent of the way early church sites were selected,particularly when a building was to be erected at an existing pagan site. Aftermarking the position of the geodetic lines, the architect designed the structureaccording to the flow of energy. Although the building displayed otherwisefunctional uses, it often concealed unusual deviations of standard buildingpractice which had been necessary to accommodate the underlying patterns ofenergy (Underwood 1973).Not surprisingly, three-line bands of energy are referenced at church entrances,particularly those with three doors: each of the two smaller side doorstypically carries the positive or negative charge, while the main central doorreferences the neutral/grounding charge.117 Similarly, a mound, standing stone,or yew tree may mark the spot where the energy coils like an underground springto “feed” the church. The grapeshot perform the same function for the cropcircle.118Shapes also influence the functions taking place within. The pyramid shape, forone, is scientifically proven to affect brainwave patterns and crystallinestructures, to the point that it mummifies dead tissue, sharpens blunt razorblades, and enhances the micro-organisms in milk and yogurt. Spherical shapesheal wounds rapidly; and trapezoidal hospital wards improve the conditions ofschizophrenics.Through their use of geometry, acoustic properties, and siting over energy-richnodes, Gothic cathedrals, in particular, can affect electromagneticfrequencies.119 When a devotee stands inside these spaces, energy is transferredup the spine to the magnetic deposits in the skull (close to the pineal gland),causing changes in awareness. According to Russian experiments, the ability fortelepathy in Gothic cathedrals and stone circles rises by as much as 4000percent. So like the ancient sites they stand upon, houses of worship affectbrainwave patterns, and by adding the beneficial resonances of chant, sonicfrequencies impregnate and rejuvenate the Earth's geodetic grid. Isn't it ratherironic that as the use of churches for prayer and psalm reaches its lowest ebb,crop circles appear, reigniting the energy of a grid whose power has lainstagnating?Crop circles and sacred sites share another common denominator in that both arelocated above or close to a water source. Water is fundamental to life, and thesurface-to-water ratio of the Earth matches that of the human body, making bothsubject to the gravitational influences of the lunar cycle. Since water is aconductor of electrical energy, the type of rock prevalent at megalithic sitescontains a high degree of quartz, a mineral with a natural ability to store asubstantial electrical charge. Stonehenge's trilithions, for example, contain aquartz similar to the type used in early radio sets (Cathie 1990). This mayexplain why at key points in the lunar cycle, energy at stone circles interfereswith compasses, and fluctuates background radiation readings and ultrasonicfrequencies—situations similar, if not identical, to crop circles.It is also known that a vortex in water creates an electromagnetic field, and asthis energy is built up, it produces antigravitational effects.120 Since wateris found in blood, and blood requires a vortex action to propel it through theveins, it is feasible that the electromagnetic field created by the cropcircle's vortex action is capable of affecting the human body, creatingconditions that affect it biologically or mentally by inducing altered states.Curious as to how this life force interacts with dowsers, I investigated thework of retired physicist Dr. Zaboj Harvalik who, as chief of the researchcommittee of the American Society of Dowsers and advisor to the U.S. ArmyAdvanced Material Concepts Agency, had asked himself the very same question.Motivated by anecdotal evidence that the human body's prime sensor is located atthe solar plexus, Harvalik performed a series of controlled experiments in whichhe covered various sensitive parts of his body with a specially shieldedcylinder, then walked across an area known to induce strong dowsing responses.The only part of his body that failed to react when blocked from the magneticwaves was the solar plexus.121 Although unaware of this at the time, it is thelocation Richard Andrews and I used for accessing the most intriguing dowsinginformation in crop circles. And we aren't alone—Paul Vigay's most startlingelectromagnetic frequency discrepancies occur three feet above the ground, thegeneral area of the solar plexus.122Image [images/p250-01.jpg]Figure 12.23 Examples of crop circles associated with extremely high frequenciesand numerous reports of disorientation: Beckhampton, 1998 (left); Roundway, 2000(middle, right).The beneficial and detrimental effects of electromagnetism upon the human bodyare already scientifically established. Less publicized are its effects whendelivered inside crop circles, where the exertion on the brain's righthemisphere is tremendous; stories abound of people experiencing an inability toperform logical tasks, especially from strangers who have no access to suchobscure information.During his dowsing of crop circles, Hamish Miller noted the effects on peopleperforming left-brain activities while inside the circles. “I found at firstsome problems in concentrating long enough to do an accurate count of theradials from the centre, and on a number of occasions during the process, Iforgot where I put the start marker, or forgot what I had used as a marker, lostthe simple count, or was distracted by some triviality. Three times, after lotsof practice maintaining the concentration, I experienced what I can onlydescribe as a time slip. The radials count would go from 5-6-7-10 and I wouldfind myself at a considerably different part of the circle on the count of tenfrom where I had been on the count of seven” (Miller 1992).Many are the times that my colleagues and I had to perform recounts andremeasurements before finally getting basic calculations, even addition,correct. Since one of my tasks at each site involves a photographic protocol, Ihave even taken to writing down the list of tasks to be accomplished, yet not asummer goes by where all of the protocols are fully met. The same applies toaerial photography. I often return without half the shots required, even thoughthese are some of the easiest assignments I've ever covered. Once away from thegeneral area of the crop circle, normal cerebral function resumes.123Preliminary tests to monitor brain rhythms via EEG (electroencephalogram) showheightened right-hemisphere activity in people inside crop circles. Some mightargue that most of this is the result of people's imagination, yet none of thesesymptoms appear to exist to the same degree outside the formations (Pringle1994).The degree to which the energy of crop circles interacts with the human body isevident in its reported effects on its nervous system. Any illness or imbalancein the body tends to become trapped in the muscle tissue in the form ofblockages of energy. In applied kinesiology, doctors—specificallychiropractors—locate these blockages by performing muscle tests, in which apatient's muscles demonstrate varying degrees of resistibility when they aresubjected to external stimuli, traditionally vitamins and herbs. But in 1995, anexperienced and intuitive Boston chiropractor began substituting them for imagesof crop circles.Dr. Randall Ferrell is not your average chiropractor, having traveled much ofthe world with an open mind in an effort to learn a diverse range of healingtechniques. In short, he'll apply whatever method works best for his patientregardless of how unorthodox the treatment sounds to conventional Westernmedicine.After locating the blocked portion of the body through muscle-testing, Dr.Ferrell runs a number of pictograms over the patient's affected organ(incidentally, the patient is not consciously aware of the image), testing themuscle reaction as he does. Eventually one image locks the muscle, indicatingthat the affected organ is stimulated by a “chemistry” inherent in thepictogram. Different designs affect different imbalances.Psychotherapist Geoff Brooks has also experienced first-hand the healingpossibilities of crop circles. Conducting a lecture, he distributed images ofthe 1997 Barbury Castle “six moons” glyph to several members of his audience togauge whether the crop circle had any significant effect on them. Oneparticipant, a long-time sufferer from acute arthritis, said the pain in herjoints suddenly disappeared when she looked at the image.Another crop circle researcher, Lucy Pringle, has compiled extensive reports ofphysical and behavioral patterns associated with crop circles. Herdata-gathering started in 1990 after she damaged her shoulder so badly in atennis game that lifting her arm to brush her teeth caused her serious pain.Still experiencing discomfort, she walked into a crop formation, and a fewminutes later, “I felt a tingle run through my shoulders, and yes, my shoulderwas completely cured. Margaret Randall, who with my sister made up the party,also experienced remarkable healing in the formation and was able to lie flatfor the first time in fifteen years” (Pringle 1990).Dorothy Colles, an eighty-two-year-old artist also suffering from arthritis,visited her first crop circle in 1999, accompanied by Lucy. Dorothy walkedslowly around the formation before lying down, asking Lucy to remain nearby tohelp her get up later. But that help would not be required as Dorothy latervigorously and painlessly got up unsupported—“without the usual arthritic creaksand effort” (Pringle 2000). Likewise, an osteoporosis sufferer was not onlyrelieved of pain after her visit to a crop circle, but has had no recurrence inthree years. A person with a tremor condition similar to Parkinson's stoppedshaking while sitting in the torus formation, and remained that way fortwenty-four hours. A hay fever sufferer walked into a formation made in a canolafield, to which she was allergic, yet was cured of her condition (Pringle 1998).Healing in crop circles is reminiscent of the folklore of healing associatedwith stone circles. In Cornwall, passing a sick child through the quartz-rich,doughnut-shaped Men-an-Tol stone is said to cure any ailment; this custom wasrecently reenacted by villagers in a crop circle in Hungary.124 The practicemight be arrogantly dismissed as the shenanigans of ignorant peasants exceptthat modern medicine now accepts that low levels of electromagnetic energy healscertain ailments, particularly bone disorders. Bones are crystalline structureswith similar piezoelectric properties to quartz crystal, and when quartz issubjected to electromagnetic frequencies, its crystalline structure storesinformation and is even capable of changing shape.125 So when electromagnetic(or ultrasonic) frequencies are administered to broken bones, they show aremarkable rate of healing. Crop circles and stone circles, possessingelectromagnetic and ultrasonic properties and positioned on sites rich in Earthenergy and water, can create similar effects.Entering a crop circle is like stepping inside a weak induction field (in whicha variable electromagnetic current is applied or taken away). Such a field iscapable of acting on the body at all levels because the body is nothing morethan molecules in a permanent state of vibration. Crop circles have the addedadvantage of geometry, and as I mentioned earlier, the angles in geometric formscontain energy. Consequently, the harmonic properties of a geometric structurecreate an additional effect on the body, since the body is a pentagonal form initself. Sound plays its part since it, too, affects the shape, even the color,of blood cells. For example, the note C makes them longer and spherical, and thenote A changes their color from red to pink. Cancer cells disintegrate whensubjected to 400–480 Hz, which are the notes A-B above middle C (Dewhurst-Maddox1993).Many people experience a sharpened awareness, euphoria, calmness, and joy insidecrop circles, with a marked increase in vigor hours after leaving them. LucyPringle collected two reports of healing from the same formation. “I feltpleasantly lightheaded the whole time, my sinuses cleared. I mentioned this tomy companion, and a young man overheard me and said his sinuses had dried uptoo” (Pringle 1993b).Sometimes these conditions are accompanied by a gentle tingling on the surfaceof the skin, particularly the palm, one of the body's most electromagneticallysensitive parts. The effect is similar to that experienced by patients treatedwith orgone accumulators, an oversized example being Silbury Hill itself.126 Asa dowser and regular visitor to crop circles, I note this sensation readily, asdoes Pat Delgado, but the effect is particularly sensed by Reiki practitioners,who report an energizing effect felt through their fingertips, as do theirpatients, in the form of abnormal heat, even though they're unaware of thepractitioners' involvement with crop circles. Excess heat is also associatedwith orgone treatment.Overall, the health effects of human interaction with crop circles includeelation, a heightened awareness, mental clarity, and physical well-being. Avisitor to more than a hundred formations, Lucy Pringle feels a sense ofwellbeing on the majority of occasions, yet at some she has gone pea-green,requiring her to leave post-haste. An acquaintance of mine who lives near AltonBarnes and walks her dogs there daily—and incidentally, has little interest inthis phenomenon—entered the “DNA” formation out of curiosity barely four hoursafter it appeared; both she and the dogs felt nauseous until they left.A woman who visited the “Triple Julia Set” told me she'd experienced threemenstrual periods within the first month after her visit. Her gynecologistinitially diagnosed her as suffering from abnormal stress, to which she repliedthat, as an advertising professional, she is permanently stressed and yet thisabnormal condition had never manifested before. Another unusual case of bleedingoccurred in the Beckhampton “Knot” (1999): three people from a small group ofJapanese tourists suffered nosebleeds simultaneously. Interestingly, this wasone of a small series of crop circles which I dowsed as having a microwavefrequency.Nausea, headaches, dizziness, disorientation, abnormal menopausal bleeding, lackof mental clarity, excessive fatigue—these symptoms represent the unpleasantside of crop circles. I usually experience a sense of well-being in cropcircles, but like Lucy Pringle, there have been times when I have experiencednausea and disorientation within minutes. Dehydration is particularly common.Following my brief stay inside the Beckhampton “Double Pentagram” (1998), Idrank six pints of water in half an hour, and continued to feel out-of-sorts forthe next twenty-four hours; my colleague that morning fared as poorly.There appears to be little rhyme or reason for these inconsistencies. From myexperience, it seems the negative effects coincide with formations which dowsefor extraordinarily high energy, when there is prolonged exposure, or if oneenters a crop circle within hours of its appearance. To confuse matters, thesesymptoms usually reverse as the crop formation ages.There are two possible causes of such symptoms: microwave radiation andultrasound/infrasound. The latter can heal or injure depending on its intensity,frequency, and an individual's length of exposure to it. Ultrasound is used inhospitals to treat arthritis and muscular rheumatism; it can also affect thecentral nervous system, including the lower brain. Both microwave and sonicfrequencies affect the pituitary gland and produce auditory signals such asclicking and trilling. Excessive exposure to either causes headaches anddehydration, because inside a resonant cavity such as the human body the dipolarmolecules of water are stimulated by extremely high MHz frequencies which createheat and accelerate the dehydration process (Schul and Pettit 1985).Like quartz, the cell membrane of human connective tissue is piezoelectric, soit has the capacity to carry electrical charges. Similarly, skin is positivelycharged, while the auric field of the body is negative. Therefore, the humanenergy field carries alternating charges which react to any electromagneticfield present. In crop circles, this field changes in polarity over time, so itsphysical effect on a person depends on the type of charge present at the time ofthe person's exposure.Studies at the University of California at Los Angeles show how the movement andcoordination of the body is relative to the level of its interaction with anelectromagnetic field, a change in which creates effects in sensory and motorskills: A saturated field improves motor performance, heightens emotionalwellbeing, and generates excitement and advanced states of consciousness. In adeficit field the results reverse and include diminished intellectual capacityand increased anxiety. Prolonged interaction with a manipulated electromagneticfield also creates fatigue (Hunt 1989). Tingling sensations, mild nausea, andgiddiness can be attributed to exposure to frequencies of 100 Hz. Anxiety,extreme fatigue, and headaches occur between sixty-three and seventy-three Hz,while levels between forty-three and seventy-three Hz are responsible forproblems with orientation and impairment of intellectual activity.To put it in a nutshell, when the collection of frequencies that make up thebody interact with another frequency, there is either harmony or discord. It alldepends on what you are stepping into. We've all walked into a room wherecertain people, for no apparent reason, make us uncomfortable, just as othersmake us feel like we've known them for generations. It comes down to sympatheticresonance. Therefore, a crop circle may be your healing temple or it may be yoursick building.While the hundreds of reports in Lucy Pringle's database tend slightly towardsthe unpleasant—althought it has to be said that people generally don't call thedoctor to say they feel fine—the emotional effects are largely beneficial.Skeptics point out this is a natural psychological reaction to contact with theunknown. This seems illogical, since it is human nature to fear and protectitself against the unknown. With a phenomenon like crop circles, therefore, onewould expect trepidation, not exuberance.Some people claim they do not “feel” the energy of crop circles at all anddismiss them as bogus, adding that anyone who senses such “cosmic energies” mustpossess a fertile imagination. You would think that since every physical body iselectromagnetic in nature and crop circles exhibit this energy, that surelypeople would detect this energy at some level. Yet as the biologist Lyall Watsonexplains: “A very weak electrical or magnetic field becomes noticeable becauseit resonates on the same frequency as the life field of the organism reacting toit” (Watson 1973). Therefore, if an individual's energy field is not inresonance with the crop circle's, then we have a case of two “tuning forks” notsharing the same tune.Animals possess sharper senses than ours and cannot be deceived by a “fertileimagination.” They are, in effect, the first eyewitnesses to crop circles sincethey can sense them coming; sheep will attempt to move as far away as possiblefrom a particular field before a formation appears, as in England it is notunusual for grazing land to border crop fields. Birds have been known to breakformation above a crop circle's airspace; birds are scared away by ultrasoundwhich is why devices emitting such frequencies are used at airports. Horsesrefuse to cross the perimeter of crop circles, or they become nervous in theirvicinity; if the land on which a crop circle appears later reverts from cerealcrop to grazing land, sheep or cows may avoid the particular spot for as long asa year.Dogs are particularly sensitive to ultrasound, as evidenced by their reaction topre-earthquake conditions, which are known to emit ultrasonic frequencies.Similarly, normally placid or obedient canines have shown unconventionalpatterns of behavior hours before the arrival of a crop circle. They have beenknown to bark incessantly from 2 to 4 A.M., to try to bite holes through doors,and to refuse to obey commands. This is a particularly unnatural trait forborder collies, the breed of choice on working British farms. Dogs may evenrefuse to enter new crop circles.While conducting dowsing surveys in three formations during 1999, I wasaccompanied by Sue and her dog, Sheba. Sue has owned Sheba for a number of yearsand is well aware of her normal behavioral patterns, indoors and out. At theDevil's Den hexagonal formation, Sheba sat upright, an air of boredom about heras if saying “Nothing special here. Can we go now?” The formation had nodowsable energy pattern. This was in sharp contrast to the dog's behavior thesame afternoon inside formations at Hakpen Hill and Cherhill. Here Shebaimmediately marked her territory at each perimeter wall and ran around in ajestful manner, even raising herself up on her hind legs as she meandered theloops and crescents. Sue was astounded at Sheba's uncharacteristic animation.Sheba resumed normal behavior a considerable distance away from these cropcircles, both of which registered some of the strongest dowsing responses I haveever measured. In addition to the complex geodetic lines present there, bothdesigns were surrounded by hundreds of concentric energy rings, each barely sixinches apart.Dogs mark their territory if they feel particularly anxious, and they generallyfind the energy centers of crop circles and treat them as they would a firehydrant. In fact, there exists an unusual number of incidences in which thesepoints (not always restricted to the geometric center of the formations) aremarked with animal droppings.Cats react strangely, too. During my third visit to the Liddington crop glyph(1996), I met a couple who couldn't understand why their normally placid catsuddenly became agitated the moment he crossed its threshold. Although used tothe outdoors, this cat protested and looked around frantically for a way out ofthe circle. Once beyond the confines of the formation he regained his habitualcomposure.Since these lasting crop circle energies produce measurable effects on humansand animals, I began to wonder if they are carrying a vibratory code which canbe used for healing. Being a practical person, I also considered how they wouldbe applied. As we saw in previous chapters, the vibrations of sounds, words,even geometries have the capacity to resonate with people and environment in away which promotes a harmonious way of being.Studies at Stanford University in the early 1900s into resonance and the natureof living organisms by the distinguished physician Dr. Albert Abrams, led to theunderstanding that disease is, in essence, vibratory. Although harassed andsystematically discredited by corporate medicine and its friends in government,a committee under Lord Holder of the British Parliament investigated Abrams'claims in 1924 and reluctantly admitted, after exhaustive tests, that Abrams'methods were proven to work. In fact, despite being made illegal, radionics waslater employed by British and American engineers to improve the quality of cropsand boost crop yield during World War II. Scrutiny of Abrams' work by Russianscientists further proved the science to be legitimate (Constable 1977;Wachsmuth 1932; Tomkinson 1975).Image [images/p256-01.jpg]Figure 12.24 Left: type of diagram used in radionic healing. Right: crop circlesgenerate similar radial energy patterns. Could crop circles ultimately be usedfor healing?The cumulative work of pioneers such as Abrams and his illustrious pupil, Dr.Ruth Drown, gave rise to radionics, an effective method of treating people andother biological systems at a distance simply by tapping a subtle energy source.One type of radionic system used today is that of Dr. Malcolm Rae, in whichremedies are stored in their perfect state on simulator cards. Each cardcontains the geometric representation of a substance in the form of concentricrings and radii. The energy of each remedy is therefore stored in “geometric”imprints and transferred to water when required.Of prime interest here are the radials on Rae's cards, because these patternsare dowsable in stone circles as well as crop circles; one crop circle alonegenerated twenty-two radials from its center, and many such crop circles areaccompanied by reports of healings.At this point I came across the work of the Institute for Resonance Therapy inGermany, which specializes in the revitalization of ecosystems in distress, suchas polluted rivers in the former Eastern Bloc and European forests dying fromthe effects of acid rain. Resonance therapy, a development of Abrams' radionics,works on the principle that every living organism is surrounded by amorphogenetic field containing a code that enables the organism to survive. Whendisease or pollution attacks the organism, the code begins to break down and themorphogenetic field contracts.Treatment is made possible by taking a photograph or a map of the area inquestion, placing it on a special appliance, and supplying information to theecosystem that enables it to heal. The “informators” used are symbols or images,usually derived from fractal geometry. When a sympathetic resonance isestablished between symbol and ecosystem, clear and quantifiable improvementsoccur to the ecosystem.Evidence that a healing code is carried in crop circles was discovered when theInstitute began using aerial photos of crop circles as “informators.”127In strictly controlled experiments, the Institute discovered that crop circlescan interact with the morphogenetic fields of systems in distress by supplying amissing code that allows these systems to heal themselves (not a far cry fromDr. Manners'cymatic therapy on human cells, and Dr. Ferrell's muscle testing).So encouraging are the Institute's results that at one point it was hired by theAustrian government to “cure” a park in Vienna where the life force of the treeswas diminished—in other words, they were dying.After three years of treatment the mean leaf density improved 20.7 percent, andvitality in lime trees jumped 37.9 percent, in oaks 34.4 percent, and in horsechestnuts 15.4 percent. The expert who monitored the project stated that thisimprovement was not explainable “by natural means.” The results are even moreimpressive in light of the data for the vitality in identical tree species inthe rest of the region which showed a declining trend in health during the sameperiod.128 Whether in resonance with or simply by matter of coincidence, whenthe IRT undertook similar projects in the Czech Republic, the country reportedits first major outbreak of crop circles.When vibrations are encoded into organic substances they give the receivingmaterial vibrational properties whose effect may be passed on to othersubstances or people (Rothstein 1958). Studies in Japan show how ordinary tapwater in a bottle can have its crystalline structure radically altered simply bya person writing, with strong intent, “I hate you” or “I love you” on the label.In a similar way, crystallization patterns in water samples taken from cropcircles show how the crystals adopt their underlying geometry129 (Emoto 1999).In the early 1980s French allergist Jacques Benveniste conducted experimentswhose results had an effect throughout the orthodox scientific community akin toa volcano decimating entire villages. Benveniste proved that a chemical code canbe memorized by water even when the original solution has been diluted thousandsof times, as is the case with homeopathic medicine which frequently uses“solutions so highly diluted that no molecules of the original active substanceshould be left to act chemically or biologically.”130 Despite French authoritiesraiding and closing down his operations (but confiscating his notes anyway), thesuccessful replication of his results by scientists in four countries hasvindicated this modern-day heretic131 (Schiff 1994). It seems that assassinationby the Establishment, regardless of method, has become a means of provingsomeone is on the correct path of inquiry.Testing Benveniste's theories that water has memory, Lucy Pringle began buryingsmall, water-filled glass bottles in crop circles to see if the water could bepotentized by their energy. In one case, blind laboratory analysis by Benvenistefound that samples taken inside the center circle of the “Triple Julia Set”showed they had indeed been potentized 51.3 percent and 136 percent abovecontrol samples (Pringle 1997).But it's not just the water that's been imprinted; the seeds appear to have beenenergetically coated too. This is not surprising considering how seeds from acrop circle sealed in a test tube for a year appear to be in a state ofsuspended animation compared to control samples in an adjacent tube whichdeveloped mold.132 A hint of the therapeutic potential of crop circle energy isexemplified by an incident in the East Field glyph of 1994 whose geometricelements gave it the appearance of an eye. When Jane Ross entered the formation,she sensed the need to bring some of its seeds home, something she'd never donebefore. Three months later, Ethan, her twenty-two-year-old son, developed asudden bleeding of the eye. He was rushed to the hospital where he was diagnosedwith a “99 percent malignant” tumor of the retina. Before an operation could beattempted, a three-month observation had to be undertaken to establish thegrowth pattern of the tumor.The possibility of saving the young man's vision looked bleak, but despite thepessimistic outlook, Jane placed her son on a selfprescribed routine of positivevisualization, meditation, and daily ingestion of seeds from the “eye” cropcircle. Over the period of observation, the only part of this program practicedwith measurable consistency was the daily seed ingestion.When Ethan returned to the doctor, his tumor was no longer malignant. In fact,it had shriveled away, leaving no trace, and there was no recurrence. Jane latershared the experience with Isabelle Kingston, who was not surprised. This notedpsychic had been “told” that the center of the crop circle was “the center ofall possibilities,” and that healing would be available from it. As it turnedout, it was the only spot in the crop circle where Jane had felt the urge togather seeds.133Barbara Berge also felt compelled to eat crop circle seeds, despite beingallergic to wheat. “The first effects were like having ingested speed—highenergy, sleeplessness, nervousness and loss of appetite. I felt I was flying.”At first she did not attribute the effects to the seeds—until she ate a few moreseveral weeks later: “Within fifteen minutes the same symptoms had reappeared,”she said, and they reappeared just before the electrical equipment in herworkshop short-circuited.When her colleagues ate the same grain they experienced similar symptoms: deepbody vibrations, the sensation of energy pouring out of their hands and head,sleeplessness, loss of appetite, disorientation.Interestingly, they also noticed a heating effect around the solar plexus.When Lucy Pringle later sent Berge another batch of seeds, Berge reported noeffects. Little did she know that this test batch consisted solely of ordinaryseeds (Pringle 1993b).All biological systems on Earth are plugged into the Earth's vibratory field, soanything of a vibratory nature interacting with that field—solar flares, radiotransmissions, sound, crop circles—will affect all life forms there. The abilityof crop circles to resonate with people at a distance via subtle energy fallswithin the proven ability of remote healing practices which can heal patients ata distance using a mere sample of their hair. Russian scientists know that bydecoding the electromagnetic code of an organism, a remedy in the form of a wavepulse can be transmitted via radio antennas to cure a population of thatorganism. Of course, the reverse also applies. In 1962, the CIA discovered thatthe Soviet military had been bombarding the U.S. embassy in Moscow withultra-low level microwave frequency, to the degree that many of its staffdeveloped cancer (Davidson 1987).134Image [images/p259-01.jpg]Figure 12.25 Left: Crop circle at Alton Priors whose seeds helped cure a retinaltumor. The illusion of an “eye” is the product of a vesica piscis and Hawkins'crop circle theorems. These nesting theorems—the hexagon inside the squareinside the triangle—also produce the note F (fourth octave).Given the inherent harmony of crop circles, there is reason to believe theirpurpose is benign, and besides, dragon energy has always been associated withlife-enhancing properties, just as Guy Underwood recognized: “A catalyst in theconstruction of matter and the generative powers of nature . . . part of themechanism by which we call Life comes into being . . . that balancing principlewhich keeps all nature in equilibrium” (Underwood 1973). Thus it is plausiblethat positive, healing energy is implicit in crop circles.Since this source is unlimited and free, it would not be surprising ifpharmaceutical companies were to look upon crop circles as a financial threat.To quote the eminent physician Dr. John Mason Good: “The effects of ourmedicines on the human system are in the highest degree uncertain, except thatthey have already destroyed more lives than war, famine, and pestilencecombined” (Babbitt 1878). Western healthcare is now the third leading cause ofdeath in the U.S.; in Britain iatrogenic death ranks fourth; and while one infive Australians is killed by conventional medical care, natural remedies with aproven record in efficacy are being banned because they undermine the colossalprofits of the pharmaceutical industry (perhaps that should be harmaceutical).Lifesaving cures censored in favor of deadly toxins marketed as leading-edgemedicines (Day 2001). Or as David Tansley, an expert on radionics, describesthem: “Unorthodox therapies which give results but more often than not appear tohave no scientific raison d'etre and thus are not acceptable to orthodoxmedicine and yet, especially in chronic disease, yield cures not obtained byorthodox means” (Tansley 1976).Image [images/p260-01.jpg]Figure 12.26 “Mother is crying” the Hopi called the pictogram at Fawley Down(left), which appeared on August 4, 1990, the day oil wells were blown up inKuwait. On the right lies an older pictogram showing a wilted Earth, whichappeared shortly before that country's invasion by Iraq.Consider, too, that in the transfer of energy from plants to water—a methodestablished by the English pathologist Edward Bach—the healing power of plantsis retained in the water's memory capacity. Although Bach's flower remedies areadministered to cure all manner of ailments, their primary effect is on thepatient's predominant psychological state (Chancellor 1971). If crop circleshave the capacity to affect change at this level, the idea of people in chargeof their own minds would be cause for sleepless nights for anyone presentlyengaged in trying to control the public mind.The imprinting of water at ground level by crop circles has far-reachingimplications. This “coded” water is seeping into aquifers that feed rivers andeventually becomes the water we drink.135 Since the homeopathic process has beenproved to act at the cellular level, as potentized crop circle water reachesevery ocean, so it inevitably touches every living organism on Earth. And justas in homeopathy, the higher the dilution the greater the resonance, and as itresonates so it generates electromagnetic frequency (Hunt 1989). As Paul Vigaydiscovered, not only is the electromagnetic frequency rising measurably in cropcircles each year, the predominant range detected matches a range in the humanbody across which no frequencies exist at all (ibid.). Add this to the earliersuggestion that crop circles may be triggering dormant parts in human DNA, andthe idea of an “awakening” gains plausibility.What is certain is that by permeating the Earth and its energy grid, the cropcircles are establishing a sympathetic resonance with its living systems. Basedon the principles of light and sound, they are unlocking a library of memoriesstored in the human body, and enabling an interchange of information to beaccepted more readily.As we enter these new temples, they in turn awaken us to the greater reality.For the crop circles are accelerating a change in awareness at a time when weare at greater odds with our natural habitat and with one another. Whoever theCirclemakers are, it is not by chance that the sudden worldwide proliferation ofcrop circles coincides with a phase in the Earth's history when its naturalsystems are threatened with ecocide. The Circlemakers appear to be aware ofthis.The Hopi were aware of this too when they reacted to a picture of one particularcrop formation (see figure 12.26 [22_chapter12.html#fig12.26]). “Mother iscrying,” they lamented, “the Earth's blood is being taken and her lungschoked.”136 The very day the formation appeared, Iraqi soldiers were blowing upthe oil wells of Kuwait, setting fire to Mother Earth's blood, and choking herlungs with smoke. A second pictogram appeared beside, symbolizing the NativeAmerican shield with the four beaver's tails—the four quarters of the Earthconnected as one Spirit—all bent and brooding, reminding us like a hieroglyphsent through time how another advanced civilization, the Egyptian, was consumedby the sand when it too lost touch with the elemental world.105Much confusion exists in the naming of these energy currents. They are oftenand incorrectly referred to as ley lines, a term coined for straight geometricalignments linking sacred sites; another term used to describe these windingEarth energies is telluric current. For the sake of clarity I will useUnderwood's geodetic lines; ley lines mentioned in this text also refers togeodetic lines.106Pyramid is a Greek term from the Hebrew urrim-middin, “the measure of light.”The Egyptian term is khuti, “the lights.” Ur, the Phrygian and Greek word forlight, thus became pur and pyr (fire). The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is a structurewhose measurements are based on the harmonic frequency of light, and itschambers are acoustically tuned to light, mass, and gravitational frequencies.107St. George also symbolizes the harnessing of Earth energy in the service ofhumanity. This patron saint is often interchanged with the Archangel Michael.108The capstones appear to have acoustical properties of their own. The capstoneof the Chun Quoit in Cornwall, for example, reverberates with an assortment ofmodes based on a major fifth chord interval.109The walls around Egyptian temples served a similar purpose in defining thecalmness of sacred space from the “waters of chaos” that lay beyond.110As the Roman Empire declined around the fourth century A.D., the RomanCatholic Church filled the structural organization and vacuum of power left by acrumbling Empire. By Emperor Constantine's reign, much of Christ's esoterictexts had been reworded or removed from the scriptures, thanks to dubiousinterpretations, and Catholicism became a quasi-political religion. In 533 A.D.the Council of Constantinople even deemed the Resurrection a heresy: “Anyone whodefends the mystical notion of a soul and the stupendous notion of its return,shall be excommunicated.” In other words, persecuted. Consequently, theexpansion of Islam into Europe was a blessing for Christians who up to thatpoint had been persecuted by the Catholic Church. My intention is todifferentiate between Christianity and Catholicism, and how the compassionateand virtuous faith of Jesus—whose foundation is not dissimilar to both pagan andEastern mysticism—was later manipulated and used as a tool by the Roman popes tocontrol the public.111The pagans viewed fire as a critical element of life—in cleansing, rebirth,and fertility. To separate pagans from this union, Santan also became thediscredited Satan, a destructive, corrupting god that opposed the energy of theone mighty God. Ironically, Satan's other name, Lucifer, means “light bearer.”112Bel is derived from the Phoenician Sun god, baal. From this root emerges“bell,” showing the creative relationship between sound and light. Many sacredrituals use bells to invoke the gods, one reason behind their use later inchurches. Incidentally, English church bells used to be forged in diatonictones.113It was later discovered that the hoax had been made as a blind test for CPRIfield operatives.114Spectrum analysis technology used by the military is capable of detectinglocal disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field. According to research by Dr.Jonathan Sherwood, this technology can pinpoint crop circles twenty-four hoursbefore the physical pattern manifests, and possibly explains why militaryhelicopters are often the first to appear on site.115Further work on Hartmann and Curry grids relative to crop circles has beencarried out by Jim Lyons, the CCCS' former science advisor. Discussion of energyrelated to sacred sites is found in John Davidson's Subtle Energy, BlancheMerz's Points of Cosmic Energy, and the work of Paul Broadhurst, Hamish Miller,et al.116In conversation with Richard Andrews.117Based on the author's dowsing research of churches in England and Portugal.118The grapeshot appear to function as batteries, supplying a spiral of energyto the crop circle. An identical relationship exists between sites such asStonehenge and its attendant tumulus. My inspiration for this research came fromstudying Underwood's meticulous charts of spiral flow at sacred sites.119“Gothic” derives from the Scandinavian guth, meaning “word.”120The antigravitational effects were noted in the studies of water vortices byViktor Schauberger (Becker and Selden 1985).121In Hindu philosophy, the solar plexus is the chakra through which the lifeforce flows.122With a few notable exceptions, Vigay's readings cluster around 260–320 MHz.These readings are found in church grounds, albeit at lower frequencies: Thesound of a running stream, a bonfire, and the wind combing through trees are256, 320, and 320 kHz respectively, the very same frequencies attributed toplainsong and church music.123The Rollright stone circle in Oxfordshire has this same effect on people. Itsstones are said to be uncountable; in fact, eleven other sites in the BritishIsles are said to produce this same effect.124Similar effects occurred during appearances of the Virgin Mary at Fatima,Portugal, 1916, and Zeitoun, Egypt, 1968. Both events were witnessed bythousands. Doctors at the time documented hundreds of cases of people healed ofcancer, arthritis, even gangrene, and yet none of these people had gone to seethe apparitions with the intent of being cured. To appease the skeptics, theVirgin Mary gave predictions of future events as validation of her apparitions,two notable examples being the dates of the Russian Revolution and the SecondWorld War.125The cellular memory stored in bone is the prime reason why Neolithic peoplesstored the bones of shamans in stone chambers and long barrows, particularly theskull, the tibia, and the forefinger.126Orgone accumulators were built in the modern era by Wilhelm Reich, whom wenow credit with the discovery of this “life force” energy that permeates allspace. His accumulators are composed of alternating layers of organic andinorganic material which serve to trap this energy. Pyramid structures aroundthe globe serve a similar purpose by using alternating types of stone togenerate alternating positive/negative energy flow. Reich's research wasconfiscated by the U.S. government and orgone accumulators remain illegal in theUnited States.127The positioning of the images on IRT's apparatus requires a “criticalrotation point,” where the image suddenly “clicks” with the environment. Is thisperhaps the purpose behind the crop circles' 4° phase shift, as discovered byAndrews? See chapter 8 [18_chapter08.html#c8].128From personal communication with Franz Lutz, Head of Theory and Research atIRT, and from The Institute for Resonance Therapy Manual, Capellburg, 1994.129Blessing of the water is an ancient ritual whereby water is given healingproperties by the focused intent of a shaman. Vestiges of this rite still existin religious services, although their meaning and effectiveness have, by andlarge, been lost.130The principles of homeopathy can be traced back to ancient Egypt and thewritings of Thoth: “This is the property of our medicine into which the previousbody of the spirits are reduced: that, at first, one part thereof shall tingeten parts of this perfect body: then one hundred, then a thousand and so oninfinitely on . . . and by how much more often the medicine is dissolved, by somuch the more it is increased in virtue.”131Benveniste's work has been further upheld after tests conducted by ProfessorMadeleine Ennis of Queen's University Belfast, in Milgraum, 2001.132From a test by Isabelle and Edward Kingston.133As far back as 1988, the antiquarian George de Trafford had written from hishome in Malta to Colin Andrews, warning him of the energies in crop circles: “Beaware of your own physical self. You are dealing with very high energies whichcan manifest in various aches and pains. These are not problems. Just recognizethem for what they are. It must surely be that your psychic structures are beingstepped up through the focus you have in the work you are doing.” Thisobservation's implications are pursued in the next chapter.134Associated Press reported in May 22, 1995, that psychotronic influencing wasalso developed by the Russians in response to technology used in America duringthe 1970s, in which hypnosis and high-frequency radio waves are combined toprogram behavioral patterns in people. One aim was to make people incapable offeeling. According to the project leader, Valery Kaniuka, the net effect is “thedestruction of the human intellect.” After the system was made public(ironically through Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost Foundation) hundreds of formerSoviet soldiers, police, and KGB operatives sued for damages.135A similar conclusion was independently reached by Page and Broughton in TheCircular, issue 33, CCCS, 1998. Their research on the aquifer connection wasmentioned in chapter 8 [18_chapter08.html#c8].136From a communication with Colin Andrews."},{"pageContent":"13. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEILJust because fish cannot walk onto dry land doesn't mean life there does notexist.—Camille FlammarionDuring the turning point of the Second World War in 1944, a channeler in Englandnamed Helen Duncan received a message from a sailor aboard one of His Majesty'sdestroyers in the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, the ship and its occupants werenot on the Mediterranean at the time, but under it, having just been sunk by anenemy battleship.With the best intention of helping the British war effort, Duncan reported thematter to the Admiralty, giving the specific location of the sunken vessel. Theproblem for the Admiralty was that the news had reached Duncan before theAdmiralty were aware of the loss of their destroyer. Sir Dudley Pound, thenfirst sea lord and chief of naval staff, reportedly took this psychic materialas a serious breach of intelligence: “Suppose there is something to what thiswoman and others are? Our whole intelligence operation could be defeated.Somehow this woman must be silenced.” An urgent recommendation, for it turnedout that she had told the truth: the destroyer had been lost with all hands atthe precise coordinates she had given.As a token of their gratitude, the British military arrested Duncan and placedher in front of a judge at the Old Bailey, who expediently put her in jail. Andnot, as would seem logical, for divulging military secrets and creating a threatto national security. The trial became a doubleedged sword—charging her for thatwould demonstrate that anyone with psychic ability could undermine militarysecrecy, leaving a target country vulnerable to psychic espionage; exoneratingher would confirm there was something to psychic power. So the court charged herunder the archaic British Witchcraft Act of 1735 (Barbanell 1945; Roberts 1945).The ironic twist to Duncan's story is that the military and other governmentbodies began experimenting with psychic power for themselves. The Americangovernment invested much time and money into developing psychic espionageprotocols to obtain political and military secrets, to identify military andterrorist targets, and to attempt to influence the thoughts of world leaders tobend to the whims of American foreign policy—essentially training psychics tobecome deadly weapons (Morehouse 1996; Puthoff 1996).Across the former Iron Curtain, the atheist Stalinist government publiclydenounced psychic ability, telepathy, even faith, as bogus, and systematicallydestroyed Russian churches as an insurance policy against any possible “invasionof the soul.” Yet one of the greatest psychics of all time, Wolf Messing, wasemployed by Stalin to predict future events and, wait for it, influence theminds of the heads of government in the Eastern Block.Different folks, same strokes.So effective was Messing's ability that a fearful Hitler put a bounty of 200,000deutschmarks on his psychic head. To Messing, working with the subconscious wasnothing more than a matter of harnessing natural laws: “Perhaps telepathy workson electromagnetic fields or some field we haven't yet discovered,” he opined,but he also emphasized: “Science must take telepathy away from mysticism andfind out how it works. Because it does work. Some years ago nothing was doneabout radio waves. Why can't telepathy bring us similar miracles? It surprisesme that scientists don't realize, or don't want to realize, that telepathyhappens all the time in their own lives. Isn't this like the savants of themiddle ages . . . refusing to admit that electricity exists although they sawlightning all the time” (Ostrander and Schroeder 1976)? Candid advice from a manwho once demonstrated his mental abilities by handing a blank sheet of paper toa bank cashier who promptly stuffed a few million roubles into Messing'sbriefcase.The practical and cash-strapped Soviets did not waste time experimenting withhocus-pocus unless they knew that practical applications would come of theresearch. By 1967 they were investing $21 million on scientific experiments intothe paranormal, to the point that telepathic techniques were incorporated intotheir space programs (ibid.).During the First World War, the Czech Army used telepathy to locate and capturea unit of Hungarian soldiers, proving that ESP can indeed be a valuable weapon.In 1925 the same army published a handbook titled Clairvoyance, Hypnotism, andMagnetism. In fact, Czech trials gave telepathic communication a reliability of98 percent, making it more reliable than their field telephones or radiotransmitters at that time (Campbell 1966).The field of clairvoyance—or whatever you feel comfortable calling psychicability—once held a central position throughout the ancient world. Free from thedictates of modern or “civilized” society, our ancestors were perfectlycomfortable accessing higher states of awareness, meditating at locations suchas a stone circle or a tumulus, where the Earth spirit induced these states ofmind. The “hill forts” and “castles” mentioned throughout this book, situatedalong prominent and often artificially shaped hills were, and continue to be,rich in electromagnetism which stimulates the brain's circuitry, facilitatingtelepathic communication between “worshippers” from one site to the next,137making these sites an early form of cell phone. Such long-distance telepathiccommunication was still practiced in recent times by the Bushmen of the Kalahari(Van Der Post 1952).Image [images/p264-01.jpg]Figure 13.1 How spinning vortices combine to give the illusion of solid matter.The idea that only a limited number of gifted individuals are capable ofcontacting other levels of reality is a fallacy borne of organized religion,which promotes contact with God as a special privilege reserved for a chosenfew, and those of us wishing to do so must contact their local intermediary, thepriest or bishop. And yet the prophet Jesus Christ made a clear reference to ourprecious gift in the Bible (1 Corinthians 3:16): “Do you not know that you areGod's temple, and that God's spirit dwells within you? For God's temple is holy,and that temple you are.” So there is no such thing as a person without psychicability, merely one who chooses not to use it.The most natural expression of the subconscious at work is demonstrated by theanxiety expressed by mothers the moment their newborn babies begin crying at theopposite end of a hospital while having blood samples taken. It seems we're allborn with this ability but gradually it gets conditioned out of many. Someretain their psychic ability in the form of inner tuition, while others developtheir potential by disregarding artificial or preconceived limitations, orthrough the study and application of mantras, mandalas, sacred geometry, andnow, crop circles.Like most other intuitive arts, Western society, in particular, has condemnedthis universal ability as irrational. Yet as Keith Thomas points out in hisweighty tome Religion and the Decline of Magic, “astrology, witchcraft, magicalhealing, divination, ancient prophecies, ghosts and fairies, are now all rightlydisdained by intelligent persons. But they were taken seriously by equallyintelligent persons in the past.” Indeed, the psychic sense was only forgottenor suppressed as we came to depend more and more on language and the printedword to get our messages across. Then by the 1700s the new science of the dayrequired that all “magic” be demonstrated and rationalized; those practices thatwere not quantifiable were cast aside.138 And yet, Hermetic knowledge,numerology, sacred geometry, even astrology—all these mystical practices wereparamount in the development of science, mathematics, the precise observation ofthe planets and the measurement of time—knowledge we today incorrectly attributeto the fruits of Newtonian and Einsteinean labor.Psychic ability is, undoubtedly, the hardest practice to prove because of thesocial barriers placed in front of the quest for its understanding, the biggestof all being ridicule. The results are hard to verify since they are, to a largedegree, dependent on personal experience or level of trust in the individualsinvolved. But on the other side of the former Iron Curtain the story is verydifferent. Since the 1950s Soviet parapsychologists have systematicallyestablished telepathy as a valid means of communication. In Bulgaria, psychicabilities have proved so useful that they have been applied throughout educationand medicine (Ostrander and Schroeder 1976). What gives eastern scientists theedge is their deep-rooted understanding that nature is composed of both the seenand the unseen, and that many of its phenomena—like infrasound and the greaterportion of the light spectrum—lie beyond our five limited senses of perception.Just as multi-national institutions do not publicly discuss the use of dowsers,so they shy from acknowledging the use of psychics, yet the employment ofindividuals with a heightened level of sensitivity is becoming more commonplacethan one might think. Psychics are employed in locating geological faults,discovering buried archaeological sites, solving computer malfunctions,diagnosing illness, even predicting earthquakes, so something obviously works.Telepathy has been used in crime-solving in Czechoslovakia since the earlytwentieth century, just as police forces throughout Britain and America todayemploy psychics to great effect in solving murder cases. The power of thought iseven used to reduce crime: In June and July 1993, a transcendental meditationexperiment aimed at reducing the spiraling crime wave in Washington, D.C.,produced an 18 percent drop in violent crime during what has historically beenthe most violent months of the year.139Even so, latterday psychics are susceptible to a backlash of the type ofparanoia prevalent in mediaeval times should their methods put at risk thelivelihoods of those whose job it is to solve the problem using conventionallogic or technology. Sometimes, like Helen Duncan, they are even imprisoned fortheir efforts.But the spiral of evolution moves on, and today we are but a breath away fromrealizing the Universe is not so much composed of matter but of consciousness.Physicists now postulate that behind every atom lies a “ghost” electron whichsupplies its energy (Irion 2000). Helen Blavatsky's nineteenth-century assertionthat “atoms are called vibrations in occultism” is vindicated today by theelectronmicroscope which reveals that everything that exists does so thanks tovibration. The nucleus of an atom spins at 1,022 Hz per second, the atom at1,015 Hz, and living cells at 103 Hz. Even the human body is now known to be an“illusion,” for if all the empty spaces are removed from it, and all that isleft is gathered up, its total mass is no larger than a drop of water. Theforces of light, gravity, and sound shape this teaspoon of chemicals into thewondrous vessels that are man and woman. So even inside our very own bodiesexist whole levels of existence beyond our conscious perception.The idea of different worlds at various levels of vibration is now gainingacceptance in quantum physics. As the nineteenth-century physicist Lord Kelvindiscovered, all particles are the result of vortices spinning at incrediblespeeds around a single point which creates a swirling ball of energy giving theillusion of solid material (see figure 13.1 [23_chapter13.html#fig13.1] on page264). However, Kelvin was merely rediscovering what the Buddha and yogicphilosophers had described centuries before, that “forms of matter arewhirlpools in a busy stream,” and that the world is maya, an illusion. Shouldthe spin of an object exceed that which is detectable by the eye, it becomesboth intangible and invisible. Alternatively, if its spin rate slows down, theobject appears to “physicalize.” In fact, substitute the words “spin,”“vibration,” or “frequency” for “spirit” and we come ever closer tounderstanding the nature of the Universe.As such, crop circles begin to look like thoughts from a creative Universe,places on our plane where the laws of light, sound, and gravity are alteredsufficiently for these “wheels of vibration” to spin down and physicalize. Andthey do so primarily when the Earth's electromagnetic field is at its lowestebb, between 2 and 3 A.M., the time window when an estimated 95 percent of soulsof the deceased leave this world,140 and the majority of crop circles enter.Therefore, crop circles mark the spot where the veil between worlds is thinnest,allowing us to interact with subtler dimensions.And for them to make contact with us.It is easier for our sixth sense (the psychic and intuitive) to connect withdimensions with faster rates of spin because such abilities, including thought,occur at the speeds of light (Hunt 1989; Myers and Percy 1999). A growing numberof first-hand experiences shows how this interaction works with crop circles andCirclemakers. On the night of July 21, 1992, Dr. Steven Greer, the founder anddirector of the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI),set up camp with his group near Woodborough Hill in Wiltshire. One night theywere met inside an existing crop circle by Gary Keel, Paul Anderson, ColinAndrews, and clairvoyant Maria Ward, among others, to conduct a remote viewingproject whereby a predetermined design was projected to the Circlemakers; thepattern consisted of three circles arranged in triangular fashion, each linkedby three straight lines. The following morning a report came in of a newformation below Oliver's Castle which bore an exact likeness to the projectedimage. As a bonus, Gerald Hawkins later found its geometry to be diatonic.A similar project took place in 1993 on farmland below Furze Knoll, a sacredsite rich in female energy and marked by an array of tumuli. This time, PaulAnderson went a step further, believing that “the circles are a message of somesort and that they are intended for humans to see and act upon.” He proved hisintent by renting a portion of the field and constructing a design in the crop.The dimensions and placements were configured beforehand by mathematicianCollete Dowell, who designed it to conform to diatonic principles; the siteitself was identified from coordinates provided by archeocryptographer CarlMunck, whose research has demonstrated (beyond reasonable doubt) that the plansof many ancient monuments have been purposely encoded with their latitudinal andlongitudinal grid references (Munck n.d.). To project the design mentally,Anderson was joined inside the completed formation by sensitives Lyn Gladwin andIsabelle Kingston, along with CPRI field researchers.Image [images/p267-01.jpg]Figure 13.2 Left: Design created below Furze Knoll to contact Circlemakers.Right: Possible reply.Days went by without apparent results. Then a month later during a routinesurveillance flight, a crop circle bearing the features of Anderson's designappeared, with all the external elements collapsed into the center of thetriangle (see figure 13.2 [23_chapter13.html#fig13.2]). Its measurements yieldedfurther surprises: Anderson had used the unit of measure common to Neolithicarchitects, the megalithic yard of 2.72 feet;141 the Surrey formation measured271.9 feet, one hundred times the size of the original (with a discrepancy of0.1 percent).Another experiment, this time using sound to communicate with the Circlemakers,was performed by Pete Glastonbury and a friend, who took up residence inside acrop circle at Berry Pomeroy one evening to play free-style music on stringedinstruments tuned to a heptatonic scale. “After fifteen minutes we heard a soundjust outside the circle,” Glastonbury recalls. “It sounded very like thecrackling you hear round your head when taking off a heavy woolen jumper. Weboth stopped playing. The sound stopped with the music, dying away to the north.The next day we discovered a small formation exactly where we had heard thesound the night before.”Three formations appeared in the neighboring fields, followed a week later by alarge dumbbell in a field of oats across the road from the circle Glastonburyhad played music in. “All around the edge of the field was a series of smalllays (looking rather like runic characters), some so delicate that theyterminated in a single stem lying flat to the ground.”142 One wonders: Do theCirclemakers create the glyphs to offer validation for well-intended thoughts?Or perhaps our thought patterns are creating the crop circles? It has beenproven that the mind can affect physical matter directly, particularly whenallied with strong intent.143 Or perhaps the individuals themselves are so intune with the surrounding energy field that they pick up what may already beencoded. For example, when Colin Andrews lay in bed asking for a pattern toappear as close to his home as possible, he fell asleep and dreamed of a Celticcross design. He was wakened hours later by farmer Geoff Smith who had justdiscovered this pattern on land behind Andrews' home. (See figure 13.3 on pageA14 in the color section.)I have noticed that as my involvement with crop circles deepens each year (andwith it the accumulation of its energetic effect on my body), I have felt agrowing attunement to the Earth's energy, such that I have accurately predictedthe glyphs up to seven months prior to their manifestation. This intuition hasbeen refined to the point that during the summer of 2000, driving past WestKennett Long Barrow, I felt as if a situation was about to occur in the fieldbeside it; eighteen hours later a new crop glyph appeared there.Jim Lyons, former science officer for the CCCS, concluded that “conceiving thegeneral shape of a formation can lead to its manifestation.” After recognizingthe underlying physics behind the spiral vortex creating crop circles, Lyonswrote to several people suggesting “that the appearance of a torus knot wouldhelp our understanding.” His wish came true that summer, after which he furtherreasoned: “If the suggestion is resonant with Nature's underlying rulebook, thenmanifestation follows naturally” (Lyons 1998).One July afternoon in 1999, Lyons and eleven other members of the Earth EnergyGroup of the British Society of Dowsers took a walk along the ridge of theOldbury hill fort at Cherhill. After surveying its famous chalk horse figure,they held a ceremony in honor of the genius loci, letting the spirits know itwould be a good place to have a crop glyph. The next day, within fifty yards oftheir wished-for site, a ninepetaled flower glyph appeared (displaying thegeometry both Jim Lyons and I independently predicted for that season). In itscenter stood a vortex consisting of six crescents—a handy validation of JimLyons' vortex theory (see figure 13.4 on page A13 in the color section).Such interactions have a habit of following the people closely associated withthe phenomenon, as if the Circlemakers are offering reassurance. There are alsomany accounts from strangers who have “received” a crop circle near their homesafter asking for specific designs. This implies we are not dealing just with aninteractive energy field, but with an energy that is conscious: “I was obsessedwith trying to draw seven-pointed stars just prior to leaving for England in1998,” said Dr. Patricia Hill, shortly before those same glyphs sprouted acrosssouthern England for the first time (Pringle 2000).Something tells me she did not cross the Atlantic to create hoaxes, particularlyas I had the same premonition at my New Hampshire home. Could all of this becoincidence? After all, some of these crop circles were archetypal symbols.Since the “coincidences” also apply to nonarchetypal symbols, the answer appearsto be no.When she began writing Signet of Atlantis on July 15, 1991, the American authorBarbara Hand Clow spontaneously drew an unusual triangular shape incorporatingcircles and rings as a guide for her book. Thousands of miles away in England,the Barbury Castle “Tetrahedron” appeared the next evening, bearing such asimilarity to Clow's drawing that her German publisher was prompted to fax overa photo of the crop circle.144 That such experiences occur regardless ofdistance was supported by Aztec elder Tlakaelel when he drew the sign of the“last ceremonial dance” in Connecticut, and his unusual “scorpion” patternappeared the same morning beside West Kennett Long Barrow. A psychic in Americasimilarly predicted the “Julia Set” at Stonehenge the very day of itsappearance. None of these glyphs are exactly archetypal.Clow's channeled material from a group consciousness became the focus of hernext book, The Pleiadian Agenda, which she finished writing in early June 1995.Again she was “given” a symbol for the book, this time a curious zigzag design,said to represent the creation of matter via electromagnetism. A few days later,in an apparent validation of her work, a crop circle bearing this symbolappeared at Cow Down, Hampshire. The story now gets more interesting. Five daysprior to the Cow Down crop circle, unbeknownst to Kerry Blower, another cropglyph had appeared twelve miles away on Telegraph Hill (see figure 13.5 on pageA15 in the color section). It was the replica of a pattern she had alreadycommitted to paper, a pattern that she had received in a dream in Wiltshire(Vigay 1995).Paul Vigay surveyed the Telegraph Hill crop glyph and picked up considerableradio interference that produced a hum. Paul followed the path of the audiblenoise and sketched it in his notebook (see figure 13.6[23_chapter13.html#fig13.6]). Shortly before leaving, the new batteries in hisequipment that should have lasted a year suddenly died; on a return trip to theglyph the same thing happened to the batteries in his camera. Exactly seven dayslater the Cow Down glyph appeared bearing as its design the exact zigzag patternof signal interference Vigay had found at Telegraph Hill.Since Vigay had not mentioned his discovery or shown his diagram to anyone,including Clow and Blower, it is unlikely that a deception took place. Mostsignificantly, Vigay's findings appear to validate the information channeled byClow.Image [images/p269-01.jpg]Figure 13.6 (a) Vigay's detected interference pattern superimposed overTelegraph Hill crop glyph; (b) Cow Down glyph; (c) diagram channeled by Clow.Image [images/p269-02.jpg]Figure 13.7 Drawing by two-year-old Mark Reynolds (left) predicting twoformations that later appeared near his home.The ability to predict crop circles appears in young children, too. In the June1992 edition of Sussex Circular magazine, readers were asked to submitpredictions for the next crop formations to appear in the area. Barry Reynolds'two-year-old son drew his on a piece of paper, dated it June 17, and mailed it.On June 23 and 28, two formations appeared at Patcham, seven miles from theirhome, incorporating the elements of the boy's drawing (A. Thomas 1992).One of the most extraordinary cases connecting the power of thought and themanifestation of crop circles concerns the “Lotus” at Golden Ball Hill (2000), aformation that gave me an unsettling feeling of déjè vu. It was later revealedto me, through a respected chaneller, that the pattern was a manifestation froma focused group meditation in India—several centuries ago.At first this may seem far-fetched. However, consider a few things: First, timeis a human invention, and outside our dimension time does not exist as such.Possibly due to gravitational and magnetic anomalies, time is even known tobehave in unusual ways on our own dimension, as army units stationed onSalisbury Plain know too well, as they often receive radio messages broadcast upto ten years earlier (Rogers 1994). Second, if you recall, this formation gave afrequency of 1.5 GHz, the frequency of hydrogen, and as per CSETI's protocol,the frequency most likely to be used in interstellar or “extraterrestrial”communication.Naturally, my curiosity deepened, and before long I came across a mantraattributed to a form of Buddhism called Nichiren Shoshu. This mantra is NamMyoho Renge Kyo (“adoration of the Lotus Sutra”) and its words break down thus:nam is the willpower of the meditating individual; myoho is the law of thehereafter (or life after physical death); renge is the name of a particularlotus flower and the karmic law of cause and effect; and kyo is both word andsound vibration (Berendt 1991). The Lotus Sutra is as important to Nichirenpractitioners as the Bible is to Christians, and its meaning appears to supportthe channeled information of this crop circle as a thought form sent throughtime and space to appear in Wiltshire.Sometimes this interaction demonstrates the Circlemakers have a mischievoussense of humor, such as the time I took my former wife for a break away from allthe research. We were driving just to the south of Coventry, an area not knownfor crop circles, when I casually remarked, “Wouldn't it be funny if we had acrop circle follow us on holiday to Scotland? Ha, ha, ha!” Five minutes passedwhen, along a prominent incline beside the busy stretch of road, a 150-footglyph grinned back at us. I was forbidden to mention the cc-words for the restof the trip.After the incident at Morgan's Hill in 1991, when the monitored field wasbreached by a crop glyph, one of the men watching the site drove back home toNottingham to find the identical pattern behind his office. It was sited to thesame size and at the same distance away from the building as the original hadbeen with respect to the observation post in Wiltshire.On occasion the interaction can provide guidance. One August morning in 1996 Iarranged to collect two members of our team. After picking up my first passengerI started on the road towards Marlborough, but at a critical point along theroute I was compelled to travel the opposite way, towards Avebury. Driving pastthe stone avenue into Avebury, I suddenly pulled over and exclaimed, “What onearth am I doing? Why am I driving in this direction?”I know the area perfectly and my passenger, an excellent map reader, was equallyperplexed. Undaunted, but not wishing to backtrack, we looked for a way acrossthe Marlborough Downs between us and our intended goal. What happened next is amystery: in front of us, after a few turns, appeared the M4 motorway—and in afew seconds, eight miles of road were unaccounted for, as if the car had beenpicked up and dropped off at another location.Since we were now quite out of our way, the only way back was through Chiseldon.As we left the town, we noticed something. “There's a new crop circle on thathill,” shouted my passenger. We had encountered the last circle of the 1996season.These are just a few examples of the myriad experiences demonstrating asubconscious communication link between human beings and the Circlemakers. Sincethe subconscious is essentially a series of electromagnetic vibrations operatingin a dimension outside the limitations of time and space, it is clear that theCirclemakers inhabit this world of refined vibration. So who are they?“We knew that the circles were going to appear in this field and we set up watchfor most of the month,” George Wingfield remarked while sitting inside the firstAlton Barnes pictogram scribbling notes. “A local medium named Isabelle Kingstontold us.”Isabelle Kingston is not your run-of-the-mill clairvoyant. Self-effacing anddown-to-earth, she projects no sense of self-importance, nor does she indulge invulgar displays of supernatural parlor trickery. This doctor's daughteroriginally worked as a liaison officer in a finance house—left-brain credentialsfor someone now working on right-brain material. When she became a mother hercareer took a back seat, allowing her the opportunity to develop an interest indowsing. “I dowsed people for vitamin deficiency. Then I'd ask them to writedown a typical week's diet and the results would correlate, proving to me thatthe dowsing system worked.”The development of her clairvoyant ability began through a chance encounter in ashop with Roger St. John Webster, a well-regarded psychic teacher, who, withoutintroduction, inquired of Isabelle, “When are you going to come to my classes?”Since then she has been a channel through which the main group of Circlemakersoften communicate. Or to put it her way, “Why me?”In 1982, during a meditation with her group on the origins of Silbury Hill,Isabelle received a message from a Universal consciousness called the Watchers,whose purpose, they told her, is to guide humanity through its difficultperiods. These enlightened beings also revealed that this “Hill of Light” (Silmeans light) was an “insurance policy” for this particular period.Isabelle was instructed to move to Wiltshire, to work on Silbury and the sacredsites around Avebury, and to be part of a phenomenon that “would be raising theconsciousness of the Earth.” Six years of opening these strategic energy pointsensued. At that time in the early 1980s, crop circles were a rare phenomenon, an“aberration of nature,” as some said, that received scant coverage even in localpapers. Then in July 1988, the Watchers said they would manifest signs of theirpurpose within seven days. Right on cue, the first sets of quintuplets appearedat the foot of Silbury.145 In the succeeding three years, Isabelle would beprovided with further instructions ahead of time as to the location and thephysical attributes of the circles.“In 1990, I was in a field out at West Kennett, but I got the location of theAlton Barnes one right and even drew it. It was referencing an energy point.” Infact, save for a superfluous triangle, her precognitive diagram is identical tothe actual glyph; she has since predicted dozens of crop circles.Her trance readings with the Watchers offer us insights into the purpose behindthe crop circles.146 If the Watchers' statements match the facts and events thatunfold in the fields (facts that form the evidence presented throughout thisbook), they are all the more astonishing considering the information was givenin 1989, long before much had been made public about crop circles, let aloneeven investigated. Here are some excerpts from Isabelle Kingston's channelingsof the Watchers:You ask the meaning of your circles in the fields. You have been made aware ofthe presence of the Watchers. Watchers is a name of a collective intelligencewhich guides you mortal humans. It is an intelligence from outside the planet,linked to angelic beings, part of cosmic consciousness.We have been coming for years and years, and this has happened many timesbefore. We have been linked with humanity to bring the power necessary to buildthe New Jerusalem. Your country [Britain] lies in the centre of the greatpyramid of light which encircles your world, and the energies of the Watchersbring love through magnetic channels.The pyramid of power which surrounds [Britain] is the key, in your words, abutton to press to activate. You are the immune system of your planet, thehealing system which will create the changes, but also there are other keyswhich will need to be activated. This country is a testing ground, it has to beright before the whole can be lined up with other dimensions. Things changing atStonehenge, a field of energy is above the stones. [Some crop] circles are theexact dimension of Stonehenge. Circles have appeared as a blueprint forhumankind to mark that place as a place of power—it is as though those placesare being unlocked. Centres are being awakened, it is part of the Plan.Your Silbury Hill lies in a field of energy which is an area which draws cosmicpower. There are ley lines running through the Earth, and at various points,lines of power are energized. It has happened mostly in this part of thecountry. Similar circles have appeared in other countries. There have also beenenergy healings to Peru, the Himalayas and the West Coast of America—all placesset down many Earth years before. We have come many times but humanity'sawareness did not recognize the signs.This ancient land holds the balance, it is the key to the world. Many of these[sacred sites] are being cleansed, as if made bright, so that they are channelsof the new energy. Many lights have been placed there, but it is as if it needsa cosmic force to actually turn the switch. It is right for many groups to tendthe lamp and get ready for the input of power.In all things you are linked—an invisible web joining all to all and us to you.Therefore work is done for those who may be weaker links in the chain. Spiritualpower, power from other dimensions, is drawn down to the Hill of Silbury—theword sil derives from the word which means Shining Being. It is the hill of theShining Beings which showed themselves to the ancient seers and started the workin earnest. The temples that remain were in fact meant to last until thiscataclysmic time in Earth's history. Therefore the foundations were laid to helphumanity at a later date. The building of the Hill of Silbury was directed bythe Watchers.Image [images/p273-01.jpg]Figure 13.8 Silbury Hill, axis mundi of the Watchers.The circles at Silbury [1990]—the Watchers helped with this, but this time thereare also elemental aspects involved, because this is what is important at themoment. We have in fact to a degree stabilized the planet, but now the naturalelements need help.The energy has been put through [crop circles] through thought-processes, withlight beams, rather like your national grid system, so we input power into theEarth's grid. This is to stabilize the energies in the Earth, to stop the Earthdestroying you. You have been told of the purpose of the Hill of Silbury: if weplaced the circles elsewhere you would not have recognized the connectionbetween the energy of ancient sites and that of crop circles.It is an intelligence of elemental energy which is linked to other solarsystems. You cannot conceive of the energy relayed at this time, but you haveexperienced sound waves transmitted at high frequency. Change the tempo of thesounds and in this will emerge the code. We will be giving different sounds atthis time. It is affirmation of facts which is necessary. You have physicalform: matter has form in its being. Matter is not just energy and light, butalso molecular formations. There is a printout being shown in the circles,therefore you are being given the body of a form. Each entity shows itself inthe formation, therefore you can communicate with these.There are some formations which link to your natural elements. There are someworking within the bowels of the Earth. There are some formations linked withthe higher consciousness of the universe. With others there is also a link withthe knowledge of the Old Ones. Therefore each formation is different. Some saythat you have the inner understanding to feel the difference.Sometimes [crop circles appear at] the same point, but as a tune of music,sometimes it is not easy to hit the same note. There is a music of the Earth andof the Universe, and a note will be revealed. Gradually the music will becompleted and you will recognize the tune. The crop circles are like a score ofthe music between the Earth and the cosmos. You do not at this time need tolearn to read the score. The best is to feel it.We give indications of energy [in the circles] and yet even if the secrets werenever divulged, they will have changed many, many souls. You can facilitate thecircles happening by sitting in a circle, sending out light and opening yourhearts. If you wish to truly enter the spirit of the formations, then stand alittle away, project your thoughts to that place, connect your mind with theUniversal mind of understanding, then you will know whether these circles are oflight beings or of man. Understanding has to grow before acceptability becomespossible, so think of the symbols given, and you will know that we are with you.We give signals in the corn and we give sound in the ear. Changes in eyes,different aches and pains around the body—as though being realigned. Sounds inears, like Morse code. Information being programmed in for a later date. Alwaysthe right ear. Also a two-way exchange at an unconscious level.How we would like you to understand the mysteries in true clarity, but the mindsof many have yet to open fully, and thus the work is painstaking and slow. . . .Seek not to accept the barrier [of rationality]. Seek not in the physical, butseek in the spiritual, for this is where the imbalance lies. You must alsounderstand that the energies being transmitted at this time are a combination ofall elements and all elemental beings, as well as interplanetary information.There is a coming-together, therefore one source is not the whole picture, andmany varying types of information might well be given.It is a time for all to work together, thus all must pool their information andfind that a vein of pure gold will run through. There is a new code ofunderstanding being transmitted. It is a blueprint of a new energy-coding comingon to the planet. We have communicated before many times: it is usually throughthought processes, but now it needs to be seen. Changes are occurring in allpeople; this sometimes stirs up anxiety and strife before the operation iscomplete.An atom of intelligence touches your world and gives you a message for you tounlock. You have been given the task to unlock ancient doorways. The informationgiven to early man has been stored, and we again come to pass the messages on.Part of you still holds the ancient civilizations, and through your genes youhave received this information. Within you, you have the blueprint to raiseconsciousness, to see the unseen, to link telepathically. Each one has, throughthe choice of your birth, incarnated with these abilities, and that small genevibrates and grows within and is passed on. You have all walked on this Earthmany times but you know you came from other civilizations, other planets. Youmust protect your world for many will follow. Therefore we give you the help,therefore we give you the key to heal. But it is the task of others on yourplanet to reconstruct the information that we are giving.Secrets will be passed and transmitted and it is your task to help andtranscribe those messages.The Aboriginal people understood the dimensions of the Dreamtime, and althoughthe information is lost, the understanding still remains. There was a time whenmany walked upon the Earth and could link into many dimensions. This facilitywas lost, but can return at the point of the change-over [consciousnessshift].[The grapeshot] contain the code that will be understood. Although the greatshapes show signs of power, as always, the smaller gems contain the greatestlight. These formations came before your planet was as it is now. The formationsare like molecular structures and blueprints—like a form of Morse code—andsomeone will be used to unravel this information, and scientists will be able touse it and put it into practice. It will be possible to use this new form ofenergy within your lifetimes [by 2007]. The unraveling will start before then.This new source of energy is now being created and certain beings are beingprepared to understand the messages being projected at this time. Power is beingcreated through the intellect of the scientist, knowledge is being awakened;some scientists are very close to the answer—an energy machine. This energy isonly partially linked to magnetism. It is linked to the illusion of time. Ratherlike thought-transference, man will be able to change the molecular structure ofthings, including himself. Within the energy-pattern of the circles we give youthis information. You humans do not believe your dreams and inspirations, soother methods have to be used. This will happen by the right people being drawninto the understanding. Some of you will be necessary to sit at the sidelinesinjecting love and light, and only a few will be involved totally.Amidst all its struggles, humanity does not seem to want to accept that lovegreat and powerful is encircling the world and being transmitted. It is mostessential to create the right atmosphere for enlightenment into the grid systemof the planet. Those who bring knowledge are here again. We are known as theWatchers, because we can only aid and help. Your Earth cries with tears, and wefeel the pain and sorrow of humanity's misunderstandings. We have not the willto change the world—this, my friends, is your work. Do not always look upward,for there is much to love below.Let's examine some of the points made by the Watchers. They said: “We givesignals in the corn and we give sound in the ear. . . . Sounds in ears, likeMorse code. Information being programmed in for a later date. . . . Always theright ear. Also a two-way exchange at an unconscious level.”After years of involvement with the circles, an unusual ringing has manifestedin my right ear; it is high-pitched and yet refined, a waterfall of Morse code.Having suffered from the harsh garble of tinnitus in my left ear for fifteenyears, I can rule that out as an explanation since the sound in my right ear iscompletely different. Such a ringing noise is often reported by people standingat the summit of the Great Pyramid, itself a highly complex geometric structurewhich collects and amplifies all manner of electromagnetic and acousticalfrequencies. This “noise” could be the sensation of super-high frequencyvibrations as they tap upon the drum of the inner ear. This ringing is allsound, and it is said to be present when the entire chakra system is open.My colleague and a long-time ground researcher, Sheely Keel, has had similarexperiences with the right ear noise, particularly during a visit to the Hakpen“Nine Spirals” crop circle. She said: “The noise in my right ear got very loudthe closer I got to the center. I was trying to write down how I was feeling butI could not get my mind to work with my hand, so there was a lot of scribblingout, along with unprintable language. When the noise in my right ear was soloud, I was shouting to Colin Andrews, who was with me at the time, telling himwhat was happening. He was having similar problems. By moving towards the edgeof the formation, it seemed to get quieter the closer I got to the edge.”Is it possible that ringing in the ear is a form of communication, part of theWatchers' “twoway exchange at an unconscious level”? In the past, suchexperiences have been associated with communication between the unseen realmsand people; in fact, as mentioned earlier, God is said to have lulled the soulto enter the physical body through sound, and you can find such a description ofthe descent of consciousness into the physical in an ancient liturgy of theChristian church, in which Jesus describes his origin thus: “When my Fatherthought to send me into the world, He sent His angel before me, by name Mary, toreceive me. And when I came down I entered in by the ear and came forth by theear.”147The Watchers referred to the crop circle trilling noise as “sound wavestransmitted at high frequency. Change the tempo of the sounds and in this willemerge the code.” This brings me to the work of David Hindley, a Cambridgeshiremusician, who found that by slowing down a highly compressed sequence of notes,fortyeight seconds of song from a skylark created nearly thirteen minutes ofsheet music. Moreover, the structure of birdsong relates precisely to theprinciples governing human musical composition, including those underlying thework of Beethoven (Devereux 1992). So, the possibility of a recognizable codetransmitted at high frequency is perfectly feasible, and if true, it is a codethat interacts with grain and humans.Such ringing and trilling sounds are often accompanied by a deep, oscillatinghum that seems to stick to your head. Many were the occasions during my earlycontact with crop circles when I walked around the house searching for adefective appliance or a malfunctioning electrical transformer out in the streetto account for this hum. Typically, such pulsations are caused by twoout-of-phase frequencies: for example, by two tuning forks ringing side-byside,one at 440 Hz, the other at 460 Hz. The effect of two tones slightly out ofharmony with each other generates a pulse that oscillates from ear to ear. Theuse of certain Tibetan bells and crystal bowls in meditation creates a similareffect (particularly when tuned to F-sharp), the idea being to drive brainwavesinto a state of greater receptivity.148We know that crop circle frequencies create heightened states of awareness. Asmonks working with Gregorian chants have found, by combining these chantfrequencies with an electromagnetic field, the stimulation to the brain andphysical body is pronounced. As the vibratory level of the body's magnetic fieldis raised, the brain generates an electrical charge forty-six times greater thanaverage, and at this point, one becomes psychically active.149 For this reason,the electromagnetic field around a psychic at work needs to be considerablystrengthened, and such an increase in electromagnetic energy both precedes andfacilitates a change in consciousness (Hunt 1989).A report by the American Parapsychology Foundation suggests that theseconditions already occur in industry. Electronics engineers working withhigh-frequency machines on occasion suddenly find themselves telepathic, to thepoint of carrying out tasks before commands are issued (Ostrander and Schroeder1976). How reassuring this is for supporters of clairvoyance, who have alwaysmaintained that it is the stepping-up of the frequency in the electromagneticfield that enables energy from another dimension to slip through as information.Has the transmission of information to humans by the Watchers taken the form ofusing humans to make crop circles? Some hoaxers have claimed this. Doug Boweronce stated: “Why we did it I cannot explain,” to which his partner in crime,the late Dave Chorley added: “It may sound crazy . . . we were being told to goout and do them” (McNish 1991). Bower even admitted this to the press in 1998.Bower may indeed not be able to explain why, and Chorley probably meant what hesaid about being told to go and do it. Of course there could be an Earthlysource to their instructions; indeed, the ambiguity of their wording sounds likecarefully prepared phrases ripe for interpretation according to the inclinationsof the listener.Image [images/p278-01.jpg]Figure 13.9 Some of the electrical and magnetic transmission devices designed bythe genius Nikola Tesla (top) bear a close resemblance to crop circles nearly acentury later. What types of technology await deciphering in the crop glyphs?Other hoaxers, who prefer to remain anonymous, allegedly had similar experiencesin that when attempting to execute a predesigned plan they felt mysteriouslycompelled to create a different design once they were in the field.Additionally, the hoaxers' presence at a site already activated as a crop circlemay leave them open to subconscious interaction with the Circlemakers.I was open to this possibility while investigating “Metraton's Cube” below CleyHill (1997). The glyph appeared at a location that had hosted many circles, andwas atop sixteen geodetic lines tied in to the Cley Hill complex, yet thepattern's straight lines did not all dowse in accordance with the underlyinggeodetic grid, which would be the case in genuine crop circles. However,according to eyewitnesses, the design appears to have “grown” from a simplelarge circle found the day before. Given that the pattern was clearly tied tothe hexagonal “Flower of Life” jigsaw (see chapter 10 [20_chapter10.html#c10]),this may have been a case where hoaxers vectored information already present inthe energy field.Let us move on to another important issue referred to by the Watchers, namelythe new forms of technology to be decoded from the glyphs appearing in the firstdecade of the twenty-first century. Two people who have embarked on the road tonew technological wonders are authors David Myers and David Percy. In theirbook, Two-Thirds—A History of Our Galaxy, they provide stunning evidence of anumber of crop glyphs encoding technology far beyond the present acceptedboundaries of physics.This technology, they say, includes energy transdimensioning, energy conducting,energy conversion, and components of a gravitron drive and a computer. The two“Key” pictograms at West Kennett and Alton Priors were found to containinformation relating to three different speeds of light; other glyphs relate toconsciousnessdriven, spinning disk technology. (A few paragraphs on thisground-breaking book cannot do it justice, and I reference this work for thesake of those who wish to see another aspect of the “bigger picture.”)Naturally, the consequences of such discoveries in crop circles will havefar-reaching consequences for twenty-first century society and how we view ourrelationship with the world beyond the physical. Such a prediction is groundedin an unusual experiment by the psychopharmacologist Dennis McKenna who,together with his philosopher brother Terence, categorized and chronologicallyplotted the greatest discoveries and technological developments since 5000 B.C.,then fed the information into a computer. After digesting the data, the computerprovided a graphic printout showing how these discoveries created a hyperboliccurve that peaked and leveled around 1975.Intrigued, the brothers programmed the computer to project and predict futurediscoveries based on this pattern; this time the line took a dramatic upswing asit reached 2011, whereupon the predictions ended. During the last two hours ofthis time-scale, eighteen barriers will be crossed, some rivaling the splittingof the atom (McKenna and McKenna 1975). These accomplishments would beaccompanied by transformations in human consciousness, curiously, in the sameyear marking the end of the Mayan calendar, which predicts this “Age ofIntellect” to be superseded by the “Age of Spirituality” in 2012.Image [images/p279-01.jpg]Figure 13.10 Two apparently identical glyphs reveal subtle differences inmeasurements when superimposed. Myers and Percy discovered these differences toencode three speeds of light. Alton Priors and West Kennett, 1991.The McKennas' theory seems plausible, considering that in the sixty-seven-yearcycle that began with the detonation of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima,technological and social breakthroughs have accelerated faster than in the timebetween Galileo and Hiroshima. The dramatic and exponential rise in theincidence of crop circles from the 1980s onwards could be one aspect of thisacceleration. Like the British physicist Bohm, the McKenna brothers present ourUniverse as a hologram, a creation of two intersecting “hyper-universes.”The McKennas propose that our holographic Universe consists of sixty-four (8x8)frequencies, of which ours is but one. As these two hyper-universes intersect,our DNA will need to evolve rapidly to cope with all sixty-four frequencies. Theevent is said to reach its crescendo in 2012. This date came about when theMcKennas programmed a computer with the sixty-four time systems, each based onthe sixty-four hexagrams of the I Ching, which itself is said to be a model ofthe physical structure of a single helical strand of DNA.150 Recall fromprevious chapters the evidence suggesting that crop circles may be involved inthe process of altering DNA and you see how the subject can get exciting.During an uncharacteristic lull in my research in the summer of 1998 I visitedIsabelle Kingston. Sitting in the shade of her garden—through which the Michaelline goes about its business—we talked about her channeled material and itsrelevance a decade later. The Watchers' specific task, she said, was still towake humanity up to the reality of what we are doing to the planet and torespond to our responsibility.“They came before in human form,” Isabelle said. “They were the ones who werethe ancient teachers and the tall beings that are in every culture. They saidthat in order for them to communicate with us they needed to set up the rightvibration; and the vibration wasn't just people's psyches but also the energy ofthe planet, because they are interstellar. That's why the Watchers laid downsacred sites as communication points to be available at a time when it wasnecessary for them to be in contact with us again. There are now groups aroundthe world reopening these points so that the communication can again take place.“They asked to open Avebury and the Wessex triangle. They had been herethousands of years before, and they set up the blueprint of much information,both technical and spiritual, and they were able to perceive how we'd evolve ashumanity, giving us a chance to get it right later. . . . They talked aboutAtlantean consciousness having the technical mind but not the heart, andtherefore humanity had the technical wisdom taken away to develop the heart andspirit. So we've taken a backward step. They wish us to have that balance whichwas missing in those days.”As she spoke the big picture stirred in my head in synchronicity with the spoonin my coffee, and it occurred to me that crop circles are also keys that unlockthe practical within people. Without any prompting, she continued: “They wouldgive signs of their intervention. These signs would also unlock the potentialwithin humanity, but it would be the potential for whatever they chose thatwould be released within them. If they chose to go with ego and domination, thatwould affect them—or compassion. It would amplify whatever was within, positiveor negative. The symbols are not just in one word; they are experienceddifferently by different people, and so you resonate with particular symbols.And always they talked about the choice of humanity—you choose what you want todo. You have a choice to muck your world up; you have a choice to make it abetter place. They are there to give us help if we need it. But it's up to us.“They said that at some level within us we have the knowledge of the Universebecause we come from the Universe. The truths are there but we've become blindto them. They are trying to help us seek into that again. They have been workingsubtly on people with scientific know-how, helping them see an image whichbypasses the brain. As the scriptures said, ‘The hand of God will touch theEarth.’ The message the Watchers give is that we are not alone. They remind usthat we can create our own reality, and that we should acknowledge thispotential in every level of society. They are getting us to be responsible, tobring us back to the land, back into sync with the Earth, because we have lostour link with it.”Belief in direct heavenly intervention to cure all our problems certainly findsa lot of support among all sectors of society. Some people might ask, “If thesebeings belong to the realm of the godly, why all the innuendo? Why not just comedown here and fix things?”Personally, I do not subscribe to the idea of the gods fixing our problems. Itis such a ridiculously easy way out. During the last two thousand years,humanity has longed for a savior, yet now it is dawning on us that only we cansave ourselves from ourselves, or to quote a Hopi elder, “we are the ones we'vebeen waiting for.” Salvation is a misunderstood word; it is an expression of thespirit striving to free itself from the bond of the physical body and religio,to reunite with its creator. And besides, protecting people from experiencerarely leads to true understanding.The Watchers intervene only if called upon, a point reinforced by Isabelle. “Itwould take years for us to figure out what the phenomenon was all about. Theywould just give it to us and we would have to mull it over. We would have to useour computers because there is information there—codes of forms of energy, codesto do with sound and music, and codes to do with healing and spirituality. Butonly if you choose to see it would it have an effect on you. They can't take ourfree will away; they are not allowed to do that. It's the Law.”If the Watchers have made cameo appearances throughout our history, it would beof interest to see if those appearances coincided with abrupt cultural leaps,such as our computer age. As the Egyptian Neteru, they were associated with theimplementation of knowledge and megalithic building practices throughout Egypt,the Near East, and Western Europe. They appeared throughout Ghanian folklore,this time under the guise of the “Shining Ones,” just as they did in England.Although no evidence has yet come to light of their presence during the Gothicera—when Europe emerged out of the Dark Ages and into the Renaissance—evidenceof crop circles surfaced in Oxford in a seventeenth-century manuscript entitledThe Natural History of Staffordshire.In 1686, Robert Plot, then professor of chemistry and keeper of the AshmoleanMuseum at Oxford, wrote in the aforementioned book an account of unusualcircular designs in fields, “those rings we find in the grass, which theycommonly call Fairy circles.”151 The circles described appear to have beengenerally 120 feet in diameter, with some as small as six feet, much like ourmodern-day grapeshot. Plot documented “the rims of these Circles, from the leastto the biggest, are seldom narrower than a foot, or much broader than a yard,”and he described their circular area as not mathematically perfect circles butslightly ovoid. Plot also noticed color variations in the plants, from a “russetsinged colour” to “dark fresh green,” and the condition of the soil inside theaffected areas which had “differed from the adjoining earth . . . the groundunder them much looser and dryer than ordinary,” characterized by a “mustyrancid smell.” So far, this is familiar territory.Image [images/p282-01.jpg]Figure 13.11 The appearance of crop circles in the seventeenth century ledRobert Plot to believe the designs were made by “trumpets” of atmosphericenergy.Like Terence Meaden three centuries after him, Plot first theorized that theseevents were the product of weather, particularly lightning of some kind thatwould arrange itself in a conical manner, breaking through the clouds from someheight to strike the ground as a circle (see figure 13.11[23_chapter13.html#fig13.11]). The events not only manifested as single circlesbut also in patterns of twins and triplets. In Oxfordshire, Plot was shown onecircle within another—a ringed circle in today's crop circle language. Othersappeared divided into quadrants and sextants, and two had a square within a ring(reminiscent of the “Grid Square”). Like today's circles, they occurred in wideopen pastures, “. . . where Trees and Hedges interrupt least” (Plot 1678).Plot provided sketches of “trumpets” descending from the sky, out of which theenergy was believed to have been generated. As odd as it may seem, on April 15,1991, two eleven-year-old Japanese boys witnessed a glowing orange objectdescend from the sky at a distance of 300 feet and project a pillar of“transparent white steam.” The pillar revolved and grew wider at the base,“giving the impression of a trumpet.” As three rings were created in the longgrass, a low alternating sound was heard. Minutes later, the “trumpet” retractedand the object bolted into the sky (Wingfield 1994).Plot's observations also support another littleknown, latter-day observation. Hewrote: “The earth underneath having been highly improved with a fat sulpherous[sic] matter . . . ever since it was first stricken, though not exerting itsfertilizing quality till some time after.”Such improved growing conditions have been noted by a number of farmers I havespoken to (all of whom wish to remain anonymous), and as far as I'm aware thisinformation has never been made public. According to the farmers' observations,the affected plants appear “healthier,” “more robust,” and “with a bettersheen.” I have seen results from replanted crop circle seeds in which the plantsclearly outgrow normal wheat samples by more than six inches; one farmer whosefield receives a lot of circles even reports higher crop yields. While thisevidence is empirical, it is worth remembering that decades ago laboratory testson plant growth proved the fertilizing benefits of ultrasound, the same range offrequencies known to exist in crop circles (Tompkins and Bird 1973).Perhaps this is part of the “new technology” referred to by the Watchers.Perhaps the day is near when this phenomenon will revive an interest innondestructive methods of farming, so when our children eat an apple they'llonce again taste the goodness of the land, not a conglomerate of chemicals.Image [images/p283-01.jpg]Figure 13.12 “We will give you the key.” Humor from the Watchers. Allington,1990.Assuming Robert Plot ran into the same phenomenon—which by all accounts appearsto be the case—this recorded period of crop circle activity in Plot's timeneatly coincided with the most recent advance in our civilization, namely, thepublishing of Newton's Theory of Gravity in 1684. This ushered in the Age ofReason, culminating as it has in the age of industrialization (or degeneratinginto, depending on your point of view). So have we gone astray since theWatchers' last involvement? Has there been a recent cry for help?“They particularly came here because they were called upon from England,”Isabelle commented. “This was during the original new age movement atGlastonbury in the 1920s and 1930s, led at different times by such luminaries asArthur Conan Doyle, Tudor Pole, and George Trevelyan. It was a morephilosophical movement then. These men had the vision of a new order, a NewJerusalem within this land. Consciousness shifts westwards every two thousandyears, so it has moved from Israel to England, just as it will resurface inAmerica around 4000 A.D. But when the consciousness of the planet hits criticalmass we get an expression of that consciousness within the fields.“There's also an interaction with interdimensional entities. This is what theshamans are and were capable of doing—interacting with different dimensions.These entities are still here, just not in the same form as ours. So you get anexpression of those other dimensions in the crop circles. You will get differentshapes because they are part of the whole strata of interplanetaryconsciousness.”“So the ‘balls of light’ are part of that consciousness?” I asked.“Balls of light are [manifestations of] consciousness that reveal themselves tous in a manner we can recognize. So what we have is a traveling energy or atraveling consciousness that moves around the planet so that we can see it. Theytravel through time and space. They are just interested and they interact withus through the mind, meditation, consciousness. They are intelligent.”152It is said that highly evolved beings are known by their sense of humor, andIsabelle herself has not been immune to the odd prank by the Watchers: “Whenthey said they would give us the key . . . oh boy,” she said, rubbing her handswith glee, “we will have the answer to everything.” Two days later appeared thefirst circle bearing an appendage resembling a key.Guided by the Watchers, the thousands of long barrows, tumuli, and other sacredsites in the landscape were strategically positioned not just to reference theEarth's energy nodes, but also as mirror images of specific constellations.153The idea was to draw down the energy associated with star systems so thatguidance or knowledge can be received at appropriate times of the month; it alsofacilitates the “score of music” to be transmitted between the Earth and thecosmos. Isabelle Kingston and her close-knit group have been “opening” thesesacred sites so their beneficial energy can again flow onto the land, enrichingit and its inhabitants with the Light. And wherever we perform these openings,crop circles invariably manifest, such as the Silbury “Koch fractal.”Another validation of our work appeared in 1994, when a crop circle bearing theinfinity symbol appeared outside the tiny village of West Overton. The glyphreflects the spirit of St. Michael, the infinity symbol (and the number 8) beinga reflection of the perfect rhythm of ebb and flow of Universal life, with whichMika-el is associated. Behind this crop circle stands the village churchdedicated to this saint, and a site the group had just opened. Interestingly,the crop glyph was aligned to the geodetic line that flows not through thepresent—and relatively modern—church, but through the original one whose ruinsare no longer visible.Each crop circle season brings with it a different theme as the Watchers work ondifferent elements. This is reflected in the crop circles' designs each year, aperfect example of form following function. The Watchers started with the simplecircles, although these have also been appearing for millennia, for they connectwith Earth's primary processes and as such are physical expressions ofup-wellings of energy from the living, breathing planet.Most crop circles lie dormant throughout the land as energy prints, waiting tobe triggered at an appropriate time by the natural flow of life force, bypremeditated action, and through various means of vibration, such as a beam oflight, a sound, or thought. Some of the patterns are laid down when the Watchersvisit, connecting with and moving the geodetic energy lines, and calling in onthe ancestors as a mark of respect, just as we lay flowers at a grave inremembrance of a loved one.During the 1998 and 1999 seasons there was a mood swing, as if a new type ofenergy had lodged itself within the Earth. This energy was reflected in the cropcircles: They seemed more agitated, some more disruptive to the body than usual.In others, the veil between the seen and the unseen felt thinner than ever. Themood among people, particularly the competition among crop circle “experts,” wasabrasive, confrontational, and more polarized than ever. To add to this, a newwave of crop circles appeared whose designs fit neither the recognized hand ofhumans nor the will of the Watchers. What changed?“The Watchers appear to have given the message,” says Isabelle. “It is time forother consciousness to start taking over. The planet is evolving, raising itsvibration, and that makes people very jittery because we are now vibrating at adifferent pulse. But if you can change your consciousness to be in tune with theplanet, life becomes easy.”154With the influx of these new frequencies, the Earth's resonant field undergoeschanges as it seeks to balance itself. The process inevitably creates biologicalstress in the human body, manifesting as disease, fatigue, agitation, emotionalinstability, or physical challenges—the very effects described by the Watchers.“Changes in eyes, different aches and pains around the body—as though beingrealigned.” So we are experiencing the raising of vibration, the shift of Ages,just as our ancestors did before us. And those beings once called the “gods,”the Watchers, have returned to guide us through these changes by offering aninstruction manual in the form of crop circles.Jane Ross is another individual who has been accessing the other side of theveil in crop circles. Like Isabelle Kingston, Jane's background in accounting isas remote from channeling as one can get. A sensitive from birth, Jane's directcontact with the phenomenon occurred in 1994, after exposure to a specificdesign which—like many of us involved in this work—turned a key within her. Sheis the former U.S. Coordinator for CPRI, and actively takes part in the gruelingschedule of information-gathering at crop circle sites every summer.Image [images/p286-01.jpg]Figure 13.13 Etchilhampton, 1997.Like Isabelle, Jane receives information about crop circles months prior totheir manifestation through trance channeling.155 The sessions are done inAmerica, and some of the information she receives includes physical descriptionsand/or locations of crop circles: “This one will be at Etchilhampton. It hassculpted sides, like crescents. It's a clockwise movement of energy. There seemto be circles or scallops or crescents interlocking on the outside edges of itwith a central circle. This is almost like a flower.” (See figure 13.13[23_chapter13.html#fig13.13].)“There will be a rather spectacular design in the Avebury complex. It hasspiky-looking edges. It is like a starburst. It is quite beautiful and huge andthere will be a lot of interest in it, and it will be quite dramatic. Around theback of Silbury Hill, in that area. That will occur when we are there.” And itdid, three days after our arrival in England (see figure 13.14[23_chapter13.html#fig13.14]). Ross's accuracy continued through 1998,particularly her prediction of a double pentagram looking “like shards of glass”(see figure 13.15 on page A15 in the color section); in 1999, she predicted thelocations and times to within forty-eight hours of the crop formations acrossfrom Silbury Hill and behind West Kennett, including the controversial “hoax” atAvebury.Image [images/p286-02.jpg]Figure 13.14 Silbury Hill, 1996.During that season I conducted a joint dowsing/psychic experiment. With Janeworking in secret from the psychic angle, I determined the location of futurecrop circles by following the geodetic lines marked by the first crop circles.The idea was to prove the human ability to connect with the Circlemakers usingintuitive channels. I pinpointed nine major formations around Wiltshire to anaccuracy of within two fields of where the formations appeared (see figure 13.16[23_chapter13.html#fig13.16]). The predictions were lodged with either ColinAndrews or Paul Vigay. As that season reached its climax, I predicted a majordesign near the steep slopes of Roundway; unknown to me, so had Jane, Isabelle,and Paul. Jane and I decided to scout the area.My chosen field looked disappointingly quiet. Jane felt the field to the southwas more “active,” so we watched it from the hilltop, as a movement ofanticlockwise energy swirled above the motionless golden crop like liquid air.It was like nothing I had ever seen. Jane predicted that the formation wouldappear within thirty-six hours, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Rubbingmy hands with glee, and without revealing the intended destination, I made aSaturday morning reservation with my pilot.Given this much advance notice, you would think we could stage a night-watch andfilm the circle forming. Well, that was the plan. Come Friday night, coffee waspoured into thermos, brandy into flask, fleece blankets were rolled up. But asthe moment drew closer, our group succumbed to a sudden and inexplicablefatigue, and we were unable to muster any strength to leave the house. Even theprospect of capturing a crop circle forming on film could not motivate us tostay awake. Ironically, we would have a genuine counterpart to the crop circlethat, three years earlier, had been filmed barely a mile away at Oliver's Castlefor the infamous video hoax (see chapter 7 [16_chapter07.html#c7]).But such are the coincidences in this phenomenon.At first light on Saturday morning, I eagerly made my way to the mist-drapedairstrip. My pilot was skeptical. “Save your money. There's no crop circle atRoundway, Freddy. I flew there at 8 P.M. last night. Trust me.”“No, trust me, make for that field,” I replied. As we flew over Roundway, thecurtains of early morning haze fell away as if greeting us with a delicatecurtsey.“Bloody hell!” exclaimed the pilot (see figure 13.17[23_chapter13.html#fig13.17]).During a channeling session a few days later, Jane Ross was told that we hadbeen kept away that night because the energy required to manifest the Roundwayglyph would have “fried” anyone in its vicinity. The dowsing response seems toconfirm that this had been one of the most powerful formations. With about onehundred feet still between me and the perimeter wall, I counted 300 concentricrings of energy, the most ever. Shortly after, I lost count and concentration. Ibarely managed to dowse for seven minutes before succumbing to extreme nauseaand mental fatigue, as did Jane, who also suffered dehydration; a third memberof our party wouldn't even enter the field. . . .Another aspect of Jane's contact with the Circlemakers is to take a few minutesto herself inside crop circles and “check her messages,” as I teasingly call it.The communication she receives varies in content, sometimes revealing thepurpose behind the design, sometimes revealing something about its creators. Shereceived the following at the torus formation (1997): “This circle is given forhealing the heart chakra, for cleansing deeply held pain and restoring joywithin.” I subsequently encountered a dozen people who each described a liftingof weight and a sense of emotional cleansing in this crop circle. Some evencried. Jane's channeled message was not revealed to anyone at the time.At the “Ant” (1997), Jane received this information: “This was made byinsect-types . . . the legs are pointing to areas of overall activation. Thiscircle is directly connected to a wideley line between two old trees at the headof the field. It is also aligned to old megalithic sites—Winchester Hill,tumuli, and long barrows. The whole area is being reactivated, and the ley linesare very strong.” This would be corroborated by the dowsing performed by RichardAndrews and myself (see chapter 12 [22_chapter12.html#c12]). Jane's geographicalreferencing and historical understanding was also correct, quite an achievementfor someone who's a stranger to the area.Image [images/p287-01.jpg]Figure 13.16 Map of crop circles in central Wiltshire during 1999, shown inorder of appearance. After the first formation at Milk Hill, each location wassubsequently predicted by dowsing.Image [images/p288-01.jpg]Figure 13.17 Psychic connection with the Circlemakers. Roundway, 1999.Two communications by Jane stand out in particular because of the attendantcircumstances. The first happened in the Bourton “Star” (1997) below Easton Hill(see figure 13.18 on page A14 in the color section). We walked into thispentagram crop glyph just as the early evening sky bore an unusualplatinumtinged turquoise hue, washing the gently rolling landscape more akin toNew Mexico. I wandered away into the formation leaving Jane to check hermessages in peace.A short while later she joined me, looking perplexed: “I'm supposed to do ahealing session here.”“On what?” I inquired, not looking up as I scribbled some notes.“On you.”That brought me up short. I was as astonished as she was puzzled. I knew thePythagoreans associated the pentagonal design with healing power, but little didI know how much. I prepared for meditation, lying on my back, legs slightlyapart, arms by my side with palms facing the soil. However, facing the palmsdownward somewhat compromises their receptivity during meditation— the palmscontain points close to the surface of the skin that allow access to the body'selectrical matrix. Nevertheless, I do this with my palms so as not to expose myinner elbows, a legacy from my childhood when I received so many injectionsthat, to this day, outstretching my arms with the joints exposed provestorturous. And so I relaxed, closed my eyes and let my mind be still; Jane stoodquietly about twelve feet away. Then, unusual things began to happen.There was a tremendous pressure on my chest, as if an elephant had mistaken itfor a footstool. It wasn't painful, just dense. The pressure built for minutes,followed by a sudden slow release of weight down my spine, along my legs and outthrough my toes, as if a bucket of treacle was literally oozing out through myfeet. My body began to feel as light as a feather.A grip now took hold of my forearms and both my arms began to rotate outwardsand lock, my palms exposed to the sky. But for the first time in my life I feltno panic, and accepted the situation with uncharacteristic calm. A tinglingsensation ran around the perimeter of my outstretched body; a singular point ofenergy meandered rapidly in and out of every finger, around my head, myshoulders, down my legs. Every nerve-ending tingled with life. A mental imagenow appeared: a group of Native American elders, their faces embodying wisdom,skin cracked like dry river mud. Beside them, a young woman dressed in buckskinkept a steady beat on a tribal drum.Slowly, the image dissipated, superseded by an intense purple light emanatingfrom a distant point and making a beeline into my forehead. This was followed bysuch intense pressure that my head tilted backwards as if something wasphysically trying to drill its way in. My windpipe stretched, my breathingstrained. Then it was over. Forty minutes had elapsed. I got to my feet a littledazed and with obvious discomfort in my forehead. Jane looked amazed: “There isa gathering of Native American tribes here: Red Eagle, Dancing Bear, SpottedOwl, Black Elk, Grandfather Coyote—they're all here.”“There was this woman—“I started to say, but Jane completed the sentence,describing her in detail. “She is the keeper of the rhythm.” Jane thendocumented the incidences that occurred throughout the event, every one of whichI could match with a physical experience: The elders had gathered the energy toenter my heart chakra, enabling all negative emotions to be squeezed out throughmy feet (“like thick, black tar oozing out of your feet”); they reenergized mychakra system (“like an electric field running around your body”); finally, theyfocused a beam of purple light containing information through Jane's hands intomy forehead. “I was very nervous about this,” she said. “I was afraid you mightget hurt because there was a lot of concentrated energy going into this beam.”Throughout the following week we would hear accounts from eight other visitorsto this site who either reported a sense of well-being or had the feeling ofbeing healed. Two days later, my forehead still aching from the session in the“Star,” I met with Colin Andrews for a debriefing, whereupon I announced plansto play a piece of prerecorded music inside a crop circle as a gesture ofgoodwill, and to ask for guidance as to the connection between sound and cropcircles, and how it could be applied in practical terms to benefit others. Welooked at photographs of thirty new formations, but none jumped out. “It hasn'tarrived yet,” I said, rather surprised by my own statement.Image [images/p289-01.jpg]Figure 13.19 The pentagram's relationship to the human body. The five-pointedstar is also emblematic of the Christed individual, one who has achievedspiritual awareness.Image [images/p290-01.jpg]Figure 13.21 5:6:7 geometric relationship encoded in the “Flower.”Two weeks and several impressive glyphs later I still felt no tug. Then on asparkling Saturday morning we walked into the field at Etchilhampton, alreadyhome to the “Grid Square.” A hundred feet away lay a second crop circle. I had asudden sense of déjàvu. “This is it. This is where I need to do my musicexperiment. This is the Atlantean six-petaled flower,” I whispered to mycolleague (see figure 13.20 on page A14 in the color section). Neither of usknew what an Atlantean flower was, yet I spoke the words with conviction. Janehad entered ahead of us and was sitting at the opposite end, checking hermessages; as we quietly unpacked measuring tapes and pads of paper, she walkedover.“So what did they say?” I asked.“It's strange. The message is for you. They said: ‘The Light flows all aroundyou. Wrap yourself with its healing power. Lyra [the constellation associatedwith sound] shall reveal the music of the cosmos should you just ask for it.Wrap yourself in the petals of this flower and the awareness that music becomeslight shall be clear to you.’”Image [images/p291-01.jpg]Figure 13.22 5:6:7 geometry relative to the six concentric rings of energy(arrowed circles) discovered in the “Lotus” glyph.With the odd hair still standing on end, I returned to the field alone laterthat night. The darkness was impenetrable, to the point that I missed theformation and had to walk up and down four different tram lines before I foundit. Half an hour later I finally reached the “Flower's” perimeter, and a tingleof energy danced upon my fingertips as I walked through its “door.” The wind andthe persistent drizzle abruptly stopped.I sat the tape recorder down and played the music, specially picked as a thankyou for the Circlemakers' works of wonder. I couldn't send them a bouquet but Iknew for certain they would receive the music, and I expected nothing exceptillumination. I closed my eyes and let things happen.Despite the darkness I sensed an intense bright light hovering over me. Itincluded all colors and its intensity was such that my eyelids began to flutter.Admittedly, at this point, the idea of running away was even more intense, so Ireminded myself of the benevolence of the source and the sense of guidance thathad so far accompanied me on my quest for knowledge. Thus reassured, Icontinued— with eyes firmly shut. By the time the light dimmed, my shoulders hadtensed up. With the back of my head resting against the damp wheat, Iexperienced a whack to the back of my neck. There was no pain, but my body lostits tension as if a nerve was unpinched, releasing all my trepidation. A senseof distance between body and ground ensued, my arms floating beside me, as if Iwere suspended horizontally above the ground.Still conscious, I saw six figures. They were very tall, dressed in long,draping, satin gowns, and they stood on either side of me, watching me, as iftransferring knowledge without uttering a word. Behind them, two others directedthings with flowing gestures of the hand. I couldn't make out their faces and itdidn't matter. I felt perfectly protected, wrapped in a blanket of unconditionallove. Again I felt the tingling energy wrap my body, this time running slowlyup, down, and across my outstretched left hand, up my arm, eventually inching tothe right and across my entire body. The sequence of events must have lastedforty minutes, for when I finally opened my eyes the tape had just stopped.156For a brief moment I had the privilege of penetrating the veil, and in thatmoment I gained an awareness that music becomes light. This illumination came tome slowly, and would eventually lead me to write this book, something I hadnever set out to do in my lifetime, at least not consciously.On one level, the hidden geometry of the “Flower” glyph may have facilitated myinterdimensional experience. A shape is an expression of the energies workingwithin it, and in this particular case what lies encoded in the design is theharmonic 5:6:7, the relationship between living things, non-living things, andSpirit (expressed geometrically by the pentagram, the hexagon, and theheptagon). For life to evolve on a planet, things need to be in harmony. OnEarth this harmony is 5:6, the relationship between its retrograde precessioncycle and its equatorial nautical miles. Completing the formula is seven, thegeometry of the Soul, and a key with which the self-aware soul is infused intothe physical body (Myers and Percy 1999).Eventually, my attention began to wander from the “Flower” to the “Grid Square”lying beside it, the pair suggesting a visual analog of right-brain spiritualityand left-brain logic. Was there another illuminating piece of evidence waitingthere, specifically an explanation to the thump on my neck and the levitation ofmy body?Knowledge of antigravity and levitation may have survived in Tibet.157 Anaccount from the late 1920s describes a ceremony performed by monks standing ina semi-circle around a large boulder. Blowing trumpets and banging drums, theycreated a tone that levitated the rock up a steep cliff (Illion 1997).Measurements of the arrangement of the instruments relative to the boulder werefound to contain specific harmonics which could propel the rock skywards, aprocess since repeated in laboratory experiments in America using ultrasound,albeit with much smaller objects (Cathie 2001).Around that time, a five-foot-tall Latvian named Edward Leedskalninsingle-handedly erected a castle in Florida made from coral blocks, someweighing as much as thirty tons. He theorized that all matter consists ofmagnets, and the movement of magnetism in materials and space gives rise to theelectromagnetic Universe. By altering the local electromagnetic field, andconsequently gravity, Leedskalnin was able to raise and move colossal blocks ofrock effortlessly.Engineer Christopher Dunn explains: “If we assume, as Leedskalnin did, that allobjects consist of individual magnets, we also can assume that an attractionexists between these objects due to the inherent nature of a magnet seeking toalign its opposite pole to another. Perhaps Leedskalnin's means of working withthe Earth's gravitational pull was nothing more complicated than devising ameans by which the alignment of magnetic elements within his coral blocks wasadjusted to face the streams of individual magnets he claimed are streaming fromthe Earth with a like repelling pole” (Dunn 1998).Had my body in the crop circle also been influenced by magnetic elements? Manyof us recall the science experiment in school in which an iron bar is aligned tomagnetic north and struck; the blow vibrates the atoms and allows them to beinfluenced by and align themselves to the Earth's magnetic field. As strange asit may seem, the human body is a type of iron bar because of the large amount ofiron in the blood. The night I experienced levitation, I had instinctively laindown inside one of the “Flower's” petals and parallel to a tram line, itselforiented to magnetic north.158 Essentially, I became the metal bar awaiting athump. Further, the human body is two-thirds water, and water molecules (amarriage of hydrogen and oxygen), when excited by pressure and given a rapidrate of spin, can be levitated; and ultrasound can supply that needed pressure.Christopher Dunn's assessment of Leedskalnin's modus operandi suggests he hadgenerated a single-frequency, tunable radio signal which, when emitted from thespeakers suspended on a wire frame above the rock, achieved the same kind ofvibrational effect as a blow with a hammer. This allowed Leedskalnin to vibratethe atoms in the rock and realign their magnetic orientation. Once they wereattuned to Earth's magnetic grid he only had to produce a second frequency whichenabled the mass of the stones to briefly disengage from the gravitationalpull—making them light as a feather.In this, the Etchilhampton “Flower,” like all crop circles, had a distinctadvantage in that it already occupied a node on the Earth's geodetic energystream.The question now was, where could the two frequencies be coming from? When JaneRoss and I earlier had sat inside the “Grid Square” we recorded an oscillating,high-pitched tone. Its purpose was later made clear during a channeling session:“The frequency of the note that they gave us is important . . . to be used inthe opening process. It's a frequency that needs to be used to complete theopening for the individual.”That note—F-sharp—creates an unusual oscillating effect between the two cavitiesof the brain, especially when generated by the tuned resonant cavity of a quartzcrystal bowl. It has a frequency of 5.8 kHz and is traditionally associated withthe tone of the Earth; this is a whisker away from that other frequencyassociated with crop circles—the trilling noise—and its frequency of 5.2 kHz,equivalent to E-flat/E.F-sharp happens to be the resonant frequency inside the Grand Gallery of theGreat Pyramid at Gizeh, and the floor of that corbelled chamber is inclined atan angle of 26.3027°, making its vertical height twenty-eight feet and theheight perpendicular to the floor twenty-five feet. Interestingly, all thesenumbers (as well as other connections to this edifice) are referenced in the“Grid Square.”The two heights of the Grand Gallery are equivalent to the tones F-sharp andE-flat (Hero 1992), which are the “Grid Square” hum and the trilling noise,respectively. So the Circlemakers and the Pyramid designers appear to share thesame technology. The Great Pyramid is a harmonically tuned acoustic resonatorwithin whose chambers the magnetic field drops to nearly zero, and in whichhydrogen is said to have played a key role. Its acoustics and geometriesgenerate vibrations that interact with its environment, both seen and unseen—itseffects on the molecules of steel, meat, and particularly water are already wellknown. Further, it is more than idle conjecture that the pyramid builders hadthe technology to neutralize the effects of gravity (Dunn 1998; Tompkins 1988;Toth and Nielsen 1985). The effects of such vibrations on the molecules of thehuman body alone would be considerable, not to mention the effects on itsbrainwave patterns. Essentially, the Great Pyramid contains the necessaryingredients that make it a kind of transformational, possibly interdimensionaltemple.Due to their strategic positioning on the Earth's energy grid, their encodedgeometries, their electromagnetic frequencies (particularly 1.5 GHz, thefrequency of hydrogen), and their effects on water and the human body, cropcircles can be likened to harmonic resonators which act sympathetically on theplanetary and human body as all three operate on the same natural laws.159My levitation experience in the “Flower” would suggest that I was being shown amanipulation of gravity; gravity is linked to the illusion of time, and time isknown to be affected inside crop circles. And since crop circles are deliveredto us within a tube of spiraling light energy, the vibratory actions containedwithin this tube at one end provides a mechanism for making plants spiral downinto harmonic shapes or, as I experienced, a window for body and soul to connectmore freely with other levels of reality.I was suddenly reminded of the words from the Watchers: “This energy is onlypartially linked to magnetism. It is linked to the illusion of time. Rather likethought-transference, man will be able to change the molecular structure ofthings, including himself.” How it echoes the sentiments of Thoth in Egypt,thousands of years before, “Man is in the process of changing to forms that arenot of this world . . . ye must become formless before ye are one with thelight.”Nine months after Etchilhampton I visited Jane at her home in America where shechanneled more information concerning my experiences that night. TheCirclemakers involved in the creation of the “Flower” explained they hadadjusted my body so that it could receive the information. This was a“scanning”; the beings described their positions relative to my body as well asthe two additional figures who had been directing the procedure—exactly as I hadexperienced it, but had never mentioned to Jane. Then came another revelation,this time concerning the purpose of the “Grid Square” and its creators, whoturned out to be yet another group of beings; as the Watchers said, there arenow many other forms expressing themselves via crop circles.“This is a highly scientific group . . . they're navigators; they'repositioners. . . . They plot the locations in the etheric and the physical ofparticular types of openings or availabilities of portals through which lightand information become available. This ‘Grid’ was the first crop circle theyhave ever laid down. They give information to those who can receive it. Thisparticular ‘Grid’ contains the clues to where the next available opening will befor the information coming through to be received by humans who have their‘antennae’ out.“This information is critical. . . . It is coded, but individuals are able tounderstand and decode it through their instinct, or gut level, as you would callit. It's information concerning what is happening as we go through the newenergy shift. So it is of a predictive and useful quality in terms of what iscoming and how to prepare for it. This ‘Grid’ was the first reference.Image [images/p295-01.jpg]Figure 13.23 The precise referencing of the “Grid Square” glyph inside the“Flower.”“I see the ‘Grid’ as four triangles pointing to the center, and there issomething to do with the area of each triangle. Open the triangles like petals,pull them outward, take that area and translate it into kilometers, and go outin each direction that many kilometers, and you will find a point. There will bean opening at each one of those four directions. Now they are saying that youcan go off on those lines, in any of the four directions, in sequences of royalcubits, and anywhere on those lines you will find an opening point. [The] points[repeat] all around the globe. The date [for the openings] is some combinationof the number of squares [in the crop circle]. They will be available on thefull moon cycle of 27.2–28 days.160“They did not do the one behind this one [the “Flower”]. [It] was created by adifferent energy entirely but is related geometrically, but not by information.They did it there because they felt they needed to be linked to the other one.If the ‘Grid’ was by itself it would not be taken seriously, so they linked itwith a beautifully executed crop circle for validity. It was necessary to decodethat crop circle so we could get on with the different kind of openings thatwill be occurring.”Image [images/p296-01.jpg]Figure 13.24 Boethian scale of music notation.One can now see the relevance of Vitruvius' famous diagram of the outstretchedman bisecting the square in four directions, as well as the references tomeasure encoded within the “Grid Square.” These bring to mind the earlierassociation with the Egyptian town of Saqqara, named after the god oforientation, for the grid was traditionally used for transcribing the order ofthe heavens upon the physical Earth. This connection between Circlemakers andancient Egyptian gods was conveyed at the end of Jane's channeling: “They keeprepeating, ‘As above, so below.’”Jane's readings reaffirm the Watchers' message of how the crop circles are notattributed to only one agency. Evidence of another type of intelligent groupconsciousness behind crop circles comes from Gerald Hawkins.While looking for diatonic ratios, Hawkins recalled that musicians have used thenotes of the first octave to encode messages in their music. One of these codesis known as the Boethian, a system of letter notation from the Middle Ages inwhich the Latin alphabet is superimposed over the diatonic (white) notes of thekeyboard. In his last fugue, for example, Johann Sebastian Bach repeats thenotes B-A-C-H. On a hunch, Hawkins took the notes found in crop circlesgeometrics and applied them to the scale using the English alphabet. He ended upwith sets of initials that seemed to repeat, but whose initials were they?If a message is being communicated, the logical approach is to consider theinitials as belonging to a group. After much referencing to heads of state,popes, and other prominent individuals, no matches were found. Hawkins thennoticed how the initials “OL” kept popping up.Oliver Lodge was a prominent physicist who, among many outstanding achievements,discovered radio (he later sold the patent to Marconi who of course got thecredit). In 1910, he devoted his research to psychic phenomena in general, suchas the possibility of communication with the departed, and eventually he becameone of the presidents of the British Society for Psychic Research. Shortlybefore he passed away in 1940 (at Lake, ten miles from Stonehenge, and now hometo the musician Sting), Lodge wrote down the details of an experiment whereby hewould communicate from the other side of the veil.This experiment, to prove that the spirit and its memory survive after death,was sealed inside seven envelopes and placed inside a safe at the Society. Itused a musical code based upon a piano exercise Lodge had learned as a child andwhich had since become a trivial obsession known only to himself: whenever hewas bored, he would rap his fingertips on any surface in that particularsequence.So was Lodge communicating to us through crop circles? That was certainly theimpression formed when the initials “O. L.” appeared again in another crop glyph(see figure 13.25 [23_chapter13.html#fig13.25]). Encoded in that design wasLodge's tapping code—3-3-6-1-2: 3 paws, 3 legs, 6 spokes, 1 central disk, and2—the ratio of rings containing Hawkins' Theorem III. When Hawkinscross-referenced the remaining sets of initials, they fitted one list only: thefirst twenty-five presidents of the Society for Psychical Research.These were by no means your average suburbanites gathering once a month forhocus pocus in the parlor. The group included Charles Richet, Nobel Prize-winnerfor medicine; John Strutt, Nobel Prize-winner for physics; William Crookes,creator of the cathode ray tube; Henry Sidgwick, ethics philosopher and Societyfounder; Camille Flammarion, renowned astronomer; and Bishop Boyd Carpenter,chaplain to Queen Victoria, just to name a few. This was a brain trust.The method employed in the coding is reminiscent of Freemasonic practice inwhich information is veiled in symbols, often multilayered in meaning. Forexample, the crop formation at Fordham Place (see figure 13.26[23_chapter13.html#fig13.26]) by Euclidean logic gives diatonic ratios 5:2 and 6(or G second octave, and E first octave) which by the keyboard code gives “J.S.” for John Strutt, whose estate was ten miles away from the crop circle. Itspattern is based on the vesica piscis and the shape of medieval seals of office,and if the pattern itself is taken as a seal, its impression in wax creates astylized monogram bearing the initials “JS.” The crop circle at Littlebury Green(1996) gives one more name on the list: Frederic Myers, a founder of the Societyand a pioneer in telepathy (see figure 13.27 [23_chapter13.html#fig13.27]).Image [images/p297-01.jpg]Figure 13.25 Berwick Bassett, 1994.Image [images/p297-02.jpg]Figure 13.26 Fordham Place, 1990.Image [images/p297-03.jpg]Figure 13.27 Littlebury Green, 1996.As with the diatonic ratios, what are the odds of all of this happening bychance?“With twenty-six letters in the alphabet there are 1/2 x 26 x 27 possible pairsof initials, A. A., A. B., A. C., etc,” says Hawkins. “So the probability of anyone random pair hitting any one of the twentyfive names on the list is 25/(1/2 x26 x 27) = 0.071. There are nine geometries with nine hits. By Bernoulli'sbinomial theorem the probability is a significant 1.7 billion-to-one in favor ofour hypothesis.”What are the crop circles telling us about reality? On one level they remind usthat the mind is powerful, to the extent that combined with intent, it iscapable of producing extraordinary circumstances and influencing events (Rhine1970). Reality itself is a construct of the mind. This has been the teaching ofavatars and mystics since time immemorial, and progressive scientists are nowbeginning to agree. Our view of reality, therefore, is crucial to the way theUniverse develops. As the children's fable says, every time someone says “Idon't believe in fairies,” somewhere a fairy dies.The astronomer David Darling expresses this elegantly in his Equations ofEternity: “The conscious mind is crucially involved in establishing what isreal. That which reaches our senses is, at best, a confusion of phantasmalenergies—not sights, not sounds, or any of the coherent qualities that weproject outward onto the physical world. The Universe as we know it is built andexperienced entirely within our heads, and until that mental construction takesplace, reality must wait in the wings.”As such, if our thoughts preclude that no other life forms exist in the Universeexcept our own, the energy of that thought has serious consequences at somelevel. This is already established in quantum physics. As the eminent physicistDavid Bohm discovered, electrons are aware of each other; likewise, thephysicist John Bell confirmed that two photons once in contact, though flyingapart at the speed of light, remain in contact with each another. By virtue thatwe too are part of a collective consciousness, our thoughts of fear and denialmay be hindering the progress of other forms of life, and so these entities arenow making us aware that they exist.161 Through their crop circles they arenudging us to raise our vibrational rate so that we experience thisunderstanding.Ancient philosophies maintain that our thoughts generate the physical world,just as God is said to have used the power of thought to generate the light andthe sound that manifest as the Universe. If we can acknowledge that an unseencosmic intelligence is manifesting itself at this critical phase in time, theCirclemakers—be they past prominent humans, entities from diverse star systems,our own group consciousness, or the Watchers, our guiding ancestors—will havesucceeded in reminding us that we are part of a greater reality. Just as ourthoughts can create actions, so those actions ripple throughout the world,creating consequences undetected by scientific instruments or our normal sensesof perception. By taking the view that “reality” is made up of an infiniteseries of energy bundles, our view of the Universe can open up to all manner ofpossibilities.If we can accept the possibility that there is still much information to beextracted from crop circles, as Isabelle Kingston predicts, then we would dowell to consider the words of another visionary human, Nicola Tesla: “The dayscience begins to study nonphysical phenomena it will make more progress in onedecade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.” With positiveprogress already reported in the field of resonance therapy, that decade may benearer than we think. The nudge from our benevolent friends in more refinedplaces may provide us with a lifeline to help reverse the degradation of whatnineteenthcentury industrialists once arrogantly called “this exploitable,lifeless lump of rock.” In the process we may even rediscover something calledfaith.Dowser Hamish Miller recalls how during his work on the geodetic lines and cropcircles he had the distinct impression of being observed: “I am a practical,well-earthed being, earning my living as a blacksmith, but I had to concedeafter some time that the number of the ‘Watchers’ seemed to increase. Later weeven appeared to hear a slight susurrus of discussion round us.”Miller discussed this with Alex Neklessa, a Russian scientist working with theparanormal, particularly with experiments on regression to find out what wentwrong with previous civilizations. “An astonishing result seemed to indicate aprobability that, in certain cases, two or three parallel realities existed atthe same time. If this was the case, and it appears to be more than idleconjecture, is it possible that in our time such a situation could occur? And ifso, could a group of highly intelligent and technically advanced beings, livingin parallel with us, but in a slightly different time frame, be a littleconcerned about how we in our wisdom are treating our planetary parent body? Andare we receiving a gentle nudge to make us aware that we are not alone, and thatwe have responsibilities to a wider concept of beings than we have been aware ofup 'til now” (Miller 1992)?Our world consists of hierarchies: in the biological functions of the body, theoctaves of music, in a plant community from forest floor to canopy. Just as ourhearing and vision are limited in comparison to other species, so must werecognize that different “hierarchies” exist beyond our perception.Angels describe realms to which our normal senses have no access. Perhaps theSanskrit writers had this in mind when they created their equivalent ofangel—the deva, the “shining one.”Gerald Hawkins sums this up with an understatement: “If crop circles are made byhoaxers, then they should stop doing it, because they are breaking the law anddamaging the food supply. If they are made by UFO aliens, they shouldn't give usback the dates of our trips to Mars and the names of men from the Titanicera—famous, clever, but now forgotten. If some are transcendental, the powerbehind it should realize that our culture is not now willing to accepttranscendental happenings.“But if they are indeed transcendental, then society will have to make a bigadjustment in the years ahead.”137Personal communication from Isabelle Kingston. Also mentioned in Hitching1976.138Likewise Michael Gauquelin, a French statistician of the 1960s, was hell-benton discrediting astrology by proving how a person's profession is in no waygoverned by their rising sign. However, his own statistics, repeated in fourseparate countries, proved him wrong and established astrology as an art abovemere superstition.139The experiment was monitored by the University of Maryland, the University ofDenver School of Law, and other research institutions. Data and information onthese and other experiments throughout the U.S. are available from the Instituteof Science, Technology and Public Policy at Maharishi International University,Fairfield, Iowa, 52557. See Roth 1994.140From research by Dr. A. J. Scott-Morley, as personally communicated by DavidElkington.141The number of transformation is 2.72, and presumably this is why it was theunit of measure for stone circles and other megalithic structures, as discoveredby the archeologist Alexander Thom. According to Myers and Percy, the exactfigure—2.720699046—is a transdimensional constant, and is equivalent to theratio between the surface of a sphere and the surface of the tetrahedron itcircumscribes. That it should have been used in the manifested crop circlefollowing the meditators connecting between dimensions is therefore above merecoincidence.142Although the formations were soon harvested, three dowsers were taken onthree different days to locate the residual energy at the sites, which they diddespite wearing blindfolds. My thanks to Mr. Glastonbury for this information.143The conclusion of twenty-five years of tests by the psychologist J. B. Rhine.144Personal communication with Barbara Hand Clow.145The quintuplet, sometimes referred to as the “Celtic Cross,” is the symbol ofMerlin and “the Shining Ones.” The latter are synonymous with the Neteru (orNetur), the Egyptian creator gods who brought knowledge to humanity. They arereferenced in the Emerald Tablets of Thoth, and their hieroglyph—an “F” attachedto an “O”—resembles a guitar. From their name is derived the word “nature,”whose Latin meaning is “origin.”146My thanks to Isabelle Kingston for permission to publish her channelings.Some of this material was previously published in Alick Bartholomew's Harbingersof World Change.147According to Walter Birks and R. A. Gilbert in The Treasure of Montsegur, thequote is found in the Gospel of St. John, as preserved in Catharist scripture,and found in ancient Christian liturgies.148The profiles of Tibetan bells are shaped like saucer barrows (a type oftumulus with a circular moat), which in turn bear a striking resemblance to theclassic “flying saucer.”149Tests performed by Dr. Genady Sergeyev of the A. A. Utomski PhysiologicalInstitute in Leningrad in the early 1970s.150Alain Aspects' work into subatomic particles also implies that not only doesobjective reality not exist but this apparently solid universe is nothing morethan an incredibly detailed hologram. See James Gleick, Chaos. My thanks toAnton Milland for bringing this to my attention.151There is a potential connection between so-called fairy circles and cropcircles in the writings of John Leyland, a chronicler appointed by Henry VIII.In his writings of sixteenth-century English folklore, Leyland describes theorigins of the maypole dance patterns traditional to England: “We go out in theearly hours and we learn the patterns that appear on grass overnight.” My thanksto Sir Lawrence Gardner for this information.152During his time as professor of physics at the University of Leipzig, GustavTheodor Fechner came to the understanding that plants are extremely sensitiveentities. In his book Comparative Anatomy he also developed this understandingof finer realms, and described how angelic beings are spherical in form andcommunicate through luminous symbols.153Based on the work of Isabelle Kingston and her group; for a similar line ofinquiry see Mark Vidler's The Star Mirror.154It is important to note that Isabelle is not suggesting the Watchers are nolonger involved, merely that other beings are coming to the fore. There are infact many forms of life and of consciousness involved in making crop circles, ofwhich the Watchers are a core group.155Most trance channelers do not remember the communication when revived fromtrance because the information cannot be processed logically. Once the mindreaches an altered state, the analytical brain is not aware of consciousnessbecause physical body, mind, and soul are operating at different vibratoryrates.156It is possible that the light was not above me, but inside me. When thepineal gland is stimulated by ultrasound and by fluctuations in theelectromagnetic field, it vibrates at a rapid speed, creating a bio-luminescenteffect as well as a humming noise. This would also explain the humming in myright ear which became more pronounced after that night. Furthermore, myexperience was not so much of a vision of another world, but the sensation ofactually being there, and far more realistic than I could account for in a dreamstate, as if my being had been momentarily freed from the anchor of gravity anddrifted into another level of reality.157Levitation is a feat associated with avatars, who mastered the laws of theUniverse and so were capable of transcending the limitations imposed by gravity.Jesus is known to have “walked on the waters,” and many images of him show hisfeet not touching the ground; the same is said of Buddha.158This brings to mind an unusual instruction in Tablet XIII of The EmeraldTablets of Thoth, the Atlantean: “Whilst thy head is placed to the northward,hold thou thy consciousness from the chest to the head.”159A resonant cavity is any contained space which allows a prolonged vibrationto take place. Resonance is essentially the vibration of a body exposed toanother vibration of similar frequency.160Russian scientists have found that when the Moon is in its full phase, ESPflows more naturally in humans. This occurs every 27.2 days. Could 27.2 be areference to 2.72, the number of transformation? Also, 27 is the numberconspicuous by its absence in the “grid square” crop glyph.161Phyllis Schlemmer, in Stuart Holroyd's Prelude to the Landing on PlanetEarth."},{"pageContent":"CODAAnd (it shall come to pass in the last days), I will show wonders in the heavensabove, and signs in the earth beneath.—The Acts of the Apostles 2:19In 1901, science discovered that a whole spectrum of color and light existsbeyond violet, a spectrum beyond our range of vision. This limitation did notdeter the theosophist and clairvoyant C. W. Leadbeater who, around the sameperiod, described in precise detail the finer layers of reality, such as thecolor and shape of emotions, and the yet-to-be discovered structure ofsub-atomic particles (Besant and Leadbeater 1901).It would be several decades before physicists such as Neils Bohr, aided by thelatest technology, made sufficient strides in understanding the map of the atomfor the rest of the world to catch up with Leadbeater's “mental” pictures ofworlds beyond our physical perception. Forays into the structure of the atomindeed reveal this smallest of particles to consist of other, finerelements—nuclei and shells, which in turn consist of protons, neutrons, andelectrons, which are themselves physicalizations of even more refined particles.The point here is that not only do solid and undeniable scientific facts have atendency to give way to new perceptions, they also have a stubborn tendency tomirror mysticism. In this case, the hierarchies that sustain the spiritualfirmament of woman and man are reflected in the physical world, precisely asHelen Blavatsky stated: “Matter is Spirit at its lowest level, and Spirit ismatter at its highest level.”Scientist and shaman, it appears, are aboard separate buses en route to beingreunited at the bus station.While this journey is underway modern culture wrestles with the dilemma posed bythe unseen and the “unusual.” As Louis Charpentier pointed out, “Science, beingthe power of the day, has condemned esoteric intellect as occult, dangerous,evil and untrustworthy” (Charpentier 1975). Yet intellect, or intus lectio,means “the gift of reading from within,” and occult means “that which is hiddenfrom view,” which demonstrates how logic and language can obscure our ability tounderstand. Thus, the overemphasis on rationality is limiting our reality towhat can only be seen or touched.Some will say that crop circles are occult, even dangerous, but then the act ofconsecrating the sacrament at a Christian mass can be deemed just as occult to aTibetan monk who communicates directly with God through meditation. As thephysicist Fritjof Capra puts it: “A page from a journal of modern experimentalphysics will be as mysterious to the uninitiated as a Tibetan mandala. Both arerecords of enquiries into the nature of the Universe” (Capra 1986).Hardly surprising, then, that today's culture struggles to accept the unseen.The new gods of television and marketing are modifying humans from a feeling,hearing race, into a seeing race led by image and fed by statistics. Ironically,this insistence on superficiality as the glue of reality is reducing our abilityto “see.” To quote Berendt: “No longer do we see the world, we see itsimages—and unbelievably enough, we are content with that, content with lookingat moving pictures. Living almost exclusively through the eyes has led us toalmost not living at all” (Berendt 1991).Cooperation between humanity and the unseen once formed the true foundation ofreligion, a reminder that faith in the higher faculties has always sought to beof service for and not against humanity. But herded into a cultural amnesia(some would even say brainwashed) by misguided dogma, we have slowly abandonedthe spiritual platform, and for centuries this helpful facility has lain fallow.Today we are overrun by triviality and littered with the transient icons of TVculture—a culture so distorted by endless graphic violence that it has evendefined two people enthralled in the natural act of making love asirresponsible, even pornographic. Given such a skewed platform it is hardlysurprising that when syllables from a creative Universe appear surreptitiouslyas crop circles, they are not always looked upon with benevolence.As we've learned from the Watchers, somewhere along the path we have chosen totake the darker road, for just as the Neolithic worldview once favored thereceptive, female nature of humanity, so the past few thousand years havereversed in favor of the male, replacing intuition with rationality, cooperationwith competition, and compassion with aggression. And now that much of theancients' original knowledge is lost, all that remains is superstition.From the moment we open our first textbooks we are still educated within theconfines of an outmoded mechanistic worldview. As the brilliant EgyptologistJohn Anthony West points out, this worldview has preoccupied the educationsystem with quantitative results that fill heads with data at the expense ofunderstanding. Yet the most wondrous elements in the Universe—love andinspiration—continuously fail to be measured, scientifically proved, orquantitatively analyzed, so according to science these states shouldn't existeither (West 1993).Let us remember that the theories and “laws” of natural phenomena are at bestour concepts of reality, rather than reality itself. Such laws are mutable,always destined to be replaced by more accurate laws as experience andunderstanding is improved. Even Einstein, despite his preoccupation with thestolid acres of physics, believed in a force beyond the quantifiable: “As far asthe laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far asthey are certain, they do not refer to reality.”At the start of this book, our rational minds, too, were challenged by this newexperience called crop circles, which our vocabulary could not easily define.Now, through the experience of thousands of individuals and validation from thewords of the Watchers, we have a greater understanding of their purpose andprocess. Far from being new, the indications are that this process was known toour Neolithic ancestors and to the ancient Egyptians, cultures that survived forthousands of years because they were founded on an intimate cooperation betweenphysical and spiritual worlds.Hence the crop circles' relationship with the sacred sites and theinterconnected energy grid reminds us that their original purpose was tofacilitate a closer connection with other levels of reality, and in so doing,show us how to reawaken the spiritual temples within us and recognize that weneed to be more accepting of Spirit.As Capra said: “Whenever we expand the realm of our experience, the limitationsof our rational mind become apparent and we have to modify, or even abandon,some of our concepts.” In light of the appearance of crop circles as thoughtsfrom other forms of life, perhaps we need now modify our perception of reality.For years, NASA has sent out radio signals based on unmistakable artificialfrequencies to tell other civilizations of our existence. When decoded, thesepulses translate into the figure of a human being. Is it really too farfetchedto assume the Circlemakers are applying a similar technique whenever theymanifest symbols whose sheer magnetism and euphonious language competes with thebest poetry for superlatives?Perhaps science awaits a suitable medium with which to quantify crop circles;after all, microbes have been around for billions of years yet only with theinvention of the microscope was their existence accepted.Crop circles, like the paradoxes of Zen, are puzzles that cannot be totallysolved by logic. To uncover their truth, an awareness based on feeling has to beapplied. As symbols, crop circles are comparable to classical Chinese word,which does not represent a well-defined concept but rather a sound symbol ofstrongly suggestive power that elicits a library of images and emotions, thepoint being not so much to express an intellectual idea but affect and influencethe listener (Capra 1986).Just as the high civilization that once was Atlantis imploded due to animbalance of logic over heart, so our unbalanced civilization draws toward itsclimax. As it does so, the alternating rhythm of the Universe inevitably swingsus toward a more harmonious state. These changes are already underway, and ideasthat were once seen as improbable and beyond comprehension about the way theUniverse works are now seriously entertained.Amid this ebb of change appear the crop circles, punctuating the timelesslandscape, mysterious as the first lightbulb, alien, and yet strangely at homeamong the Wessex terrain.Was the choice of location haphazard? The Circlemakers could have chosen China,but would its political control of information allow the message to cross itsborders?162 Or Australia, with its sparse, endless terrain, but would anyone bethere to see the signs? Or America, with its country-sized grain fields, butwould its capitalist ideology allow the sharing of information only to thehighest bidders?I am often asked why there seem to be few crop circles reported on U.S. soildespite the bulk of land available. Maybe it's a matter of attitude. Unliketheir Canadian counterparts, farmers in Indiana have been more preoccupied withlooking for somebody to sue rather than investigating the cause of markings inhead-high corn fields, which were cordoned off with police tape as if they werecrime scenes. Perhaps for them they were. Likewise in Missouri, crop circlesappearing on Amish lands are methodically destroyed before witnesses are able totake photographs. Should you ask them to photograph, the normally placid Amishwill threaten to fine you $1500.With this kind of welcome, few would want to knock on your door.If contact with nonhuman life continues to follow the U.S. military's example ofresearching UFOs—shoot them down and analyze them—then it's no wonder contactneeds to be made in more subtle ways with people who appear to have everyinclination of behaving like barbarians. Yet compare this attitude with that of“pagans” in South Africa in response to crop circles: “Whenever a circleappeared in the fields, the people rushed to erect a fence of poles around thecircle. They would dance and perform other sacred rituals honoring the star godsand the Earth Mother. All the kings and chiefs awaited the arrival of thesecircles. Their appearance would be cause for celebrations which lasted severaldays. The celebrations were accompanied by prayers to the gods to watch over thepeople and talk to them through the sacred sites” (Mutwa 1996).163The choice of Britain as the prime location for crop circles suggests awell-orchestrated plan. They reference sacred sites in a country brimming withancient markers, where such sites are still honored, where the study of esotericknowledge survives, and whose language is understood throughout the world,enabling information to be disseminated on a vast scale.The other question is why have these “encyclopedias in plants” come to ourattention now?Several factors mark our time as more favorable for an interaction between ourdimension and others. The Mayan calendar is helpful here. Possibly the mostcelebrated date in this masterpiece is 2012 A.D. The Maya believed that on thewinter solstice of that year, an alignment between our solar system and theMilky Way will trigger a time of spiritual acceleration (Jenkins 1998).Likewise, the Aztec calendar shows that we are at the end of a 13,000-year cycleand that significant changes in the Earth and in human consciousness arepredestined like clockwork. Native American prophecies, particularly those ofthe Hopi, describe this time period as the transition from the “Fifth Age” tothe “Sixth Age” of humanity. Their prophecies state that in previous transitionsa disconnect existed between humanity and Earth, along with a polarization ofheart and mind. As the gulf between the two became unbridgeable, a collapse ofthat Age was necessary to establish a new rhythm of harmony.That planetary alignments can influence the Earth was demonstrated in 1999. OnAugust 11, an alignment of the Sun and Moon with the center of the Earth createda total eclipse of the Sun across northern Europe; later, on December 12,heliocentric astrological charts showed the planets arranged in three grandtrines around the Sun, creating a nine-pointed star alignment in the solarsystem.164 Either the crop circles were precursors of such events, or theCirclemakers were pointing to their significance, for 1999 saw crop circlesreferencing ninefold geometry for the first time; two other formations thatsummer depicted the path of a Moon eclipsing the Sun.The charts' originators, Marcus Mason and Brett Kellett, echo the growing beliefthat geometric astrological aspects such as grand trines are grounding newenergies in the Earth: “These stellar archetypes of the Sidereal Zodiac areimprinting into our consciousness through the matrix of the Tropical Zodiac,which holds the akashic record of collective human consciousness and evolution.As the new archetypes imprint, the old archetypes, patterns and paradigms aresimply falling away.”165Preceding these energy shifts and changes are times of confusion and apparentselfdestruction, and few will doubt that we are now living in turbulent times.Gregg Braden sees this as one indication of a vibrationary shift:Some individuals feel it rippling throughout every cell in their body,perceiving that time, and their lives, are speeding up. Others are experiencinga new kind of confusion, as if nothing in their lives really fits any longer . .. the systems that provide the infrastructure to life and society, inclusive ofpersonal systems such as health, finance and relationships, are in a state ofdynamic flux. . . . Whether you believe in the near-term close of a great cycleor not, one fact remains. Within a relatively short period of human history,regardless of your age, you have witnessed events that rocked the veryfoundations of who and what you believe your world is about (Braden 1993).As the new codes of energy imprint themselves upon the crystalline structures ofthe Earth, changes within Her will trigger systems in the body to follow suitbecause the human energy field seeks to maintain its umbilical connection withEarth Mother.166 Midwives capable of seeing auras are reporting seeing a newchakra developing in newborn children, between the throat and the heart,suggesting a shift in communication is underway that will move us closer to theheart than the head.167 In fact, more children of this generation are being bornwith exceptional abilities—mental, physical, psychic—further indications that,as a species, we are evolving.Image [images/p305-01.jpg]Figure 14.1 To the Hopi, the appearance of the crescent on Earth signifies thereturn of the Star People. Furze Knoll, 1994.As our vibrational rate increases, life appears to be speeding up in our newexperience. The more a person's vibratory field is tuned to these globalchanges, the greater one's receptivity to transcendental ideas, insight, andthought patterns of a penetrating and global scale (Hunt 1989). And throughthis, consciousness is changed. Disharmonious frequencies in the body,particularly thought patterns, begin to stand out so they can be attended to andhealed. Consequently, a person's light or dark aspects are accentuated; lifeappears to be chaotic, irritating, and frustrating as our cells learn the newtune. Those resisting the process, particularly if they stubbornly cling to oldbelief systems, are finding the process even more grueling.According to chaos theory, an evolutionary transition to a higher state isaccompanied by the breakdown of the harmonic field system (order). When newenergy is introduced, as is the case with crop circles, it reverses the processof disintegration so that matter can be reorganized and enabled to achieve thishigher state (Prigogine and Stengers 1984). Order breaks into chaos that buildsinto order. As science writer James Gleick explains, “The greater theturbulence, the more complex the solution, the greater the jump to a higherstate” (Gleick 1987).One of the positive effects of these changes is that as our vibratory levelsrise to match that of Earth's, portions of our sensory systems that have laindormant for centuries gradually awaken, giving those who so choose theopportunity to access finer levels of reality.This brings us to another factor explaining the rise in crop circles. TheEarth's magnetic field strength, which rises and falls like a wave, hasdecreased by 38 percent over the past 2,000 years, and it is predicted to keepfalling (Braden 1993). Historically, the construction of sacred sites coincideswith the peaks and troughs of this wave (Bucha 1967), indicating that ourancestors were aware of these key moments in the Earth's shifting magneticfield, and used such pivotal moments to experience more rapid development oftheir consciousness. Possibly for this reason they constructed their sites todouble-up as astronomical markers, and remind future generations when thesecycles are likely to occur. Since we have neglected to maintain this tradition,crop circles are used as reminders.These reminders—thought waves, geometries, frequencies—are housing themselves onthe planet to request our reality to move beyond its limitations, to get us tofeel rather than think. The pivotal moment of this communication may haveoccurred on August 17, 1987, the date of Harmonic Convergence. On that day, itis said the Earth reached a position in the galaxy that would facilitate a shiftin human consciousness. It, too, was predicted in the Mayan and Aztec calendars,as well as in Native American lore, as the time when “144,000 Sun-Danceenlightened teachers would awaken to become points of Light to help the rest ofhumanity dance their dream awake.” In essence, the shamans of the world receivedthe call to coax the unenlightened from their sleep.Not having the faintest idea at the time as to why, on that very day I feltcompelled to drive one hundred miles to visit Stonehenge for the first time.When Native American prophecies speak of this change in cycles, they speak of atime “when the Moon will be seen both on Earth and in Heaven.” “We had somecircles in Indian reservations in the Northwest of the USA, at places wherethese UFOs, as you call them, visit us each year. It is possible that aconnection exists,” said the late Chippewa medicine man Sun Bear.168 NativeAmerican tribes maintain they are descended from the Star Nations, races ofbeings populating different star systems such as Sirius and Orion;169 the Sioux,for example, trace their origin to the Seven Sisters of the Pleiades.In 1994, the Moon did appear on Earth, when crescents were added to the cropcircle alphabet. To the Hopi, in particular, this was an emotional occasion, forit was the sign for the return of the Star Nation people, and a fulfillment ofprophecy (see figure 14.1 [24_coda.html#fig14.1] on page 305). In simultaneousvisions around the world, indigenous elders were told the time had come toreveal to the rest of the world the spiritual knowledge of the Star Nations,including the influence of Star People on their cultures and spiritual beliefs.So what better place to announce these ancestral truths than at the one locationon Earth where all nations are represented: the United Nations. This supposedseat of global unity responded by adopting an unprecedented closed-door policytowards our indigenous brothers and sisters.Undaunted, Lakota spiritual leader Standing Elk also made an unprecedented move.He convened a gathering of tribes from all over the world in South Dakota, wherethe Star Knowledge would be shared with Western representatives from diversebackgrounds. During the course of the five-day affair, Standing Elk made astartling announcement: “The Star Nations were the most crucial of all entities,because the thought of other races communicating with the grassroots peoplewould create a major threat to the religious systems, the economy and theeducational system of any government.“The greatest fear in the governmental structures was the knowledge that allforms of ‘Star Government’ had no monetary systems within their governingstructures. Their system was based on the mental, spiritual and universal lawswith which they were too mentally and spiritually intelligent to break. Thecollapse of the monetary system within the United States government and thereligious denominations became a national security issue, and so it became aneasier task to make the Lakota/Dakota belief system illegal to participate inand practice.”170Oglala spiritual leader Floyd Hand emphasized at the gathering that religiousfigureheads such as Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha were related to the StarNations. But, he added, that as their time drew nearer, if warnings were notheeded and appropriate action not taken, so would global catastrophes escalate.Such tidings are strangely reminiscent of scriptures in which God reveals Itselfto humanity in subtle and helpful ways—miracles, healings, divine laws—but whenthese hints are ignored, cataclysms are used to wake people up, particularlythose at the slowest vibratory levels. In light of these revelations, thefalsifying and sabotaging of crop circles, regardless of motive or sponsor,begins to resemble the killing of infants by Herod in a desperate attempt to ridhimself of the Christ child who would supplant his authority. For it is clearthe crop circles are empowering the individual, and in so doing, helping todismantle an entrenched belief system that has thrived on fear and the conceivedpowerlessness of people.Crop circles do this by providing instructions for self-help. They allow us tosee the Universe as a series of relationships between a multitude of partscomprising a whole. They show us we have the ability to influence the outcome ofour reality through our thoughts and actions. We are already witnessing this inour laboratories: Experiments at Princeton's Engineering Anomalies Research labshow that people's focused intentions affect such mechanical constants as thetiming of a computerized drumbeat and the motion of pendulums. Thousands oftrials reveal machines' obedience to the thoughts of their human operators, andthat the human mind is capable of affecting approximately one in every 10,000random events (Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research 1995; Jahn and Dunne1987; Nelson et al. 1998). In fact it is predicted that by the explicitinclusion of human consciousness we shall one day come to understand the truenature of matter (Wigner 1970).As one note in the chorus of creation, the human being is special. Its thoughtsbecome sounds, sounds become words, words generate actions, and coupled withintent, actions manifest all manner of consequences. This makes every one of usresponsible and accountable for what we manifest.171 Fifteen centuries ofEuropean history teaches us that if a greater mass of people hold an overlypessimistic image of the future, chances are that image will manifest asreality. Apocalypses are seldom the result of predictions and more the releaseof pathological behavior in society which creates the situation in the end (Walland Fergusson 1998). Humanity's war record of the twentieth century alone isreason enough to want change, but to achieve it we must first overcome thecultural illusion that we are somehow separate from the Creative Spirit.For more than six thousand years, Eastern and pagan mysticism have shown that wecan connect with Spirit through our very own antenna, the human body. Throughthe simple act of pressing the palms together, fingertip to fingertip, we adoptthe pose in countless sculptures of figures frozen in the act of praying, aritual instinctively practiced a billion times every day throughout the world,without many of its participants being aware that it is an action far beyond acall to prayer: By pressing the palms you are activating an electronic systemwhich connects you with the Oneness of creation and allows you, as a part ofthat Oneness, to intercede upon your own behalf through your thoughts. As thesaying goes, “You have the whole world in your hands.”As more people are made aware of this, they are gathering in groups around theworld to pray for change. In 1998, a world-wide prayer led by author JamesTwyman and dedicated to averting war between the U.S. and Iraq attracted anestimated twelve million participants. This focused thought for peace resultedin the stepping down of hostilities the following day; in fact, so successfulwas the effect that Twyman was subsequently invited to Northern Ireland torepeat the exercise. Within three days, arms were finally laid down and peacenegotiations commenced.With their foundations in divine principles, the crop circles' resurgence atthis pivotal moment is precipitating a change. At the birth of a new millenniumwe are already witnessing more ideas based on hope, sustainability,spirituality, and tolerance taking shape than at any other period in modernhistory. For this change to manifest we must participate as co-creators. We haveasked for help, we have been offered the tools, and we have been shown how theywork, but ultimately, we must have the will to implement them.Just as music plays a mediating role between Heaven and Earth, so crop circlesare communication channels between humanity and God, a communication that speakspassively without threatening or shocking, and by this subtle approach, people'sviews of the world are gently changed. By their appearance in wheat—primeingredient of bread and the very symbol of the Earth—crop circles provide anurturing bond between the Earth Mother and her children gathered within theprotective bosom of her circle—a circle that lures us irresistibly towards thecenter by providing games through which we learn. And, just like children, we goaway to process what we've learned in time for a new season of lessons.Like sound, crop circles are a language of feeling, a language beyond thelimitation of words. And being a Universal language, it does not align with anyone individual, any one religious system, ethnic group, academic curriculum, orpolitical belief. Like flowers responding unquestioningly to the Sun, those whoopen their hearts to unconditionally embrace the melody of a crop circle becomeatoned—they become at-one, and like an unplanned meeting with a holy person, theencounter can irreversibly change their view of life.Charpentier, in his ode to Gothic cathedrals, felt much the same way as I doabout crop circles. They are created by specialists who use knowledge anddeliver it as a signature in the fields. They use beauty as a bait, arousing theemotions, luring the intellect to embark on creative thinking. They nourish oursouls, and as the Prophet Mohammed said: “If I had only two loaves of bread, Iwould barter one to nourish my soul.”They are the new temples, places of initiation, incantation, and opening.They are harmonic creations of light, sound, and magnetism, and so they are themirrors of humanity, guiding us to reflect within, unlocking ancient memoriesand reminding us that we are not egocentric, but cosmocentric.Many times have I walked into the Circlemakers' temples and there I found theone element perfectly capable of being reproduced by all human beings.Love.162To demonstrate the point, information has only recently reached the West thatChina is home to a significant number of pyramids, some of which rival those ofEgypt.163One is reminded of dancers in stone circles whose movements between the gapsin the stones can generate bioelectricity, creating a condition similar to adynamo. The electrical charge is stored in the stones and the underlying water,and released with the approach of new groups of people or the rhythm of theMoon. Hence why there exists such a rich folklore of dancing at sacred sites.Such an effect may also explain the festive mood of people who visit the cropcircles.164A Grand Trine on the wheel of the zodiac is where an equilateral trianglelinks the energies of the cardinal, fixed, and mutable sign associated with eachof the four elements (earth, air, fire, water). According to A. T. Mann, thegeometrically balanced Grand Trines indicate harmonious states of being, andimply a fluid exchange of energy and communication. Interestingly, in particlephysics the triangular shape describes the interaction of the basicforce-carrying particles, the quarks.165My thanks to Marcus Mason and Brett Kellett.
