This is the center, the goal, even the “ mission statement ” of this book. And Colin Andrews is in a unique place as the premier authority on the crop circle phenomenon. When one reads Colin ’ s findings, it is self-evident that he is such an expert. But this is not all: He is also an intelligent, kind, spiritual gentleman with whom it has been a pleasure to work. Sometimes, a book can act as a catalyst for change. I think Colin would agree with me that if Crop Circles: Signs of Contact inspires even one reader to be more environmentally conscious, then we will have done our job. There is prob- ably no greater mission for us all. It has been an honor to work with Colin Andrews on this book, this “ report to the world ” that has been two decades in the making. Crop circles have meaning, and that, in as succinct a way as this sometimes prolix writer can state, is the essence of this book ’ s mission statement. There are real crop formations all over the world, and science does not know how or why they are formed. There is hard sci- entific evidence that some circles are un- deniably not manmade. Changes in the plants that cannot be duplicated in hoaxed circles; odd sounds that have been re- corded in authentic crop circles; and, per- haps most astounding, the sudden appearance of enormous formations in mere minutes — creations that would take many men many hours to produce appear in minutes. Skeptics have their work cut out for them — I ask them to read the chap- ter in this book about the 900-foot Julia Set near Stonehenge that appeared in a span of 45 minutes before leaping to manmade conclusions. This book is Colin Andrews ’ s story, and I am grateful to have been sitting around the particular campfire where and when he decided to tell it. My Circle There are several stories in this book of people who have “ requested ” a crop for- mation, and one has subsequently appeared for them. The words “ wished for, ” “ prayed for, ” and “ asked for ” are used to describe these petitions to the “ circlemakers. ” 02 sspignesi introduction.p65 2/11/03, 4:45 PM 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact In early November 2002, I, too, joined the ranks of those who have had such an experience and, at Colin ’ s request, I relate the story here. During the weekend of November 2, 2002, I tried a crop circle experiment. I had been working closely for weeks with Colin Andrews on this book, and he had told me many intriguing stories about crop circle manifestations appearing “ upon request. ” I decided to give it a try. Outside my office window is the “ backyard ” of our condominium develop- ment. It is all pristine green grass and, dur- ing that autumn weekend, I asked for a pattern to appear in the grass, but I also requested that it be in a precise spot: the spot where my eye fell when I turn my head to the right and look out my window. A few days went by, but I saw nothing in the grass. I began to wonder if I had not worded my request properly, or if I was simply not attuned to the circlemakers in the manner in which the others whose wish had been granted had been. But then, on Wednesday morning, November 6, 2002, I saw something. Tues- day had been a stormy day in Connecticut, with a great deal of rain and wind. On Wednesday morning, I looked out my win- dow, and there I saw a design in the grass — and it was in the exact spot where I had asked that it appear. I saw a perfect circle of grass in the middle, surrounded by a wide ring of soil, with a spur of soil ex- tending out of the northwest corner of the circle. I grabbed my copy of the Andrews Catalogue and began flipping through the pages, quickly stopping on page five. There it was: T107. The exact grass design, turned clockwise, and with two small satellites that I did not see in my grass. The grass was pressed down from the rain and wind, creating a perfect T107. I esti- mated it as approximately 3 to 4 feet long, and 2 to 3 feet wide. I later realized that not only was this pattern one of the recorded designs, it was also very similar to an ice circle that had appeared in Churchill, Maryland, in February 2001 — and which I had been writ- ing about around the time I made my request. I did not take a picture of the design, and the following morning, it was gone. The grass dried in the sun and wind and filled back in, and the soil ring was covered. I could still glimpse a shadow of the center grass circle, but overall, it was now nothing but a normal expanse of suburban grass. I know what I saw, and I know that the design was most assuredly not there when I initially requested it. What has this experience taught me? It has confirmed for me that Colin Andrews is truly on to something with his belief that human thought plays a role in the crop circle phenomenon. What I found most intriguing about this experience is that the design appeared in the only possible way I would be able to see it: by flattening ordinary backyard grass. Grass is not a ce- real crop, and yet nature spoke up (stepped in?) with her rain and wind, and then there was a perfect circle of grass surrounded by a ring. In the introduction to my book The Weird 100 , I wrote that I remain open to all the wonders of reality, consciousness, and the unknown because I do not believe that I know everything. I experienced a UFO sighting one time in my life. And now I have experienced a crop circle. There are wonders to be discovered. They may make themselves known to us in the sky, or in the fields, and I truly be- lieve that the 90 percent of our brains that we do not currently use must have been given to us for a reason. Perhaps it is what we will use to understand all that we do not now know. — SJS December 30, 2002 02 sspignesi introduction.p65 2/11/03, 4:45 PM 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction: My Mission Statement / 15 Introduction My Mission Statement by Colin Andrews 15 W ith Crop Circles: Signs of Con- tact , I hope to inform the gen- eral public about the crop circle phenomenon in an accurate and truthful fashion. I also hope to remove the “ weird ” stigma attached to crop circles. We have deliberately tried to write a book for the mainstream reader, the world citizen who knows about crop circles, may have seen the movie Signs , is curious about what is actually going on, but is not inter- ested in complicated discourses on plant bi- ology, mythology, mathematical theory, or paleoclimatology. People do want to know what is going on in their world, on their planet, and are interested in what the crop circle enigma means for their future. People know the earth ’ s environment is in trouble. Parents today know that their grandchildren, and possibly even their children, may enter adulthood worrying about water shortages and breathing problems caused by pollu- tion. Our problems are not of the future; they are here now. It is our belief that crop manifestations may somehow be tied into this. I have researched this mystery longer than anyone else, and in this book, I share my data, views, and findings with my read- ers. I also hope to stimulate discussion, and foster an atmosphere of open-minded in- quiry and curiosity. The publication of this book is my opportunity to communicate to my read- ers the importance of the crop circle phe- nomenon, and to provide the evidence of its significance in an open and honest forum.

This crop formation was discovered on the morning of June 22, 1995, by a farmer on his land at Longwood Warren, near Win- chester, Hampshire, England. It was determined to be a “ genuine ” formation (that is, not manmade) by the re- nowned biophysicist William Levengood, who found distinct and measurable cellular changes in plants taken from the formation. Other evidence pointing to its authen- ticity included no damage to the plants or soil compression; no tracks to vital construc- tion points; and very complex braiding of plants in the outer ring where numerous circles were positioned, and which was de- termined to be extremely difficult, if not impossible for humans to achieve without leaving evidence of their presence. Also, two eminent scientists, Gerald Hawkins and Robert Hadley, both con- firmed that the scaling and placement of the “ planets ” within the crop formation were extraordinarily accurate and that it was a very precise replica of our solar system. Also, I personally had extensive discus- sions with members of the only organized group of counterfeit circlemakers working at that time (to my knowledge) and none of them claimed responsibility for the forma- tion, nor knowledge of who else could have made it. Frozen in time is our solar system, with the Earth missing from its orbit. This formation has a history, and a pro- found meaning. The first thing this crop pattern does is call attention to Earth ’ s empty orbit. When we also consider that this celestial configu- ration is what the solar system will look like in approximately 30 years, and again in 100 years, the question arises: Are we being sent a message? Is the universe telling us of our possible fate? Are we being warned that if we continue on the reckless, damaging path we are on, then the future of mankind is at risk? When Marcus Thompson, the writer and director of the crop circle – themed movie A Place to Stay , came to me to discuss his project, I suggested that he should include this solar system design in the film. I felt that the formation, and its possible message was important enough to replicate precisely, and include within the storyline of the movie. Marcus was including a powerful environmental mes- sage in the film, and I felt that this design would contribute to his mission. He agreed, and I supplied aerial photographs (includ- ing the one on the cover of this book) to his production team to assist them in their construction work. I asked Matthew Wil- liams and his team to create the solar sys- tem formation in the fields. The formation was ultimately made (and is seen in the movie), and all agreed that it was a very close duplicate of the origi- nal. But that ’ s where the similarities ended. The created formation had extreme plant damage, widespread soil compression, ma- jor errors in the geometry of the design, and it took so long to make that many of the public were able to see the half-finished pattern in broad daylight. Even though we provided the measurements, ratios, and scal- ing data to the construction team, they were still unable to complete it in one night and, when it was finished, it was so obviously manmade, that it reminded us even more so of the truly amazing nature of the spontane- ous, authentic formation. All our research convinced us that the original formation was authentic. Its pos- sible message struck a chord with all of us, and thus, my recommendation that it ap- pear in the movie, and my decision to high- light it on the cover of Crop Circles: Signs of Contact . 02a candrews introduction.p65 2/11/03, 4:45 PM 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction: My Mission Statement / 17 The Madison Square Garden Speech Scattered throughout the book are a handful of excerpts — greatly abridged and heavily edited for clarity and space — from a two-hour speech I gave at Madison Square Garden in the fall of 1996.

If we put aside manmade formations for the moment, and concentrate on what some investigators claim are the real phenomenon, there are still too many theories one can choose from, and each, in their own way, is believable. It re- ally does depend on your own point of view and how your understanding sits with what you have experienced along the way. Too many profess to know the an- swer, and if their view is challenged, then they will usually throw a fit and ostra- cize anyone who doesn ’ t quite see it their way. That, I ’ m sure, is not the way to the truth. I see my friend Colin as a mentor to all would-be-followers of this circle mystery. He has thrown his life into it, trying to get at the truth. Although oth- ers have come and gone in a flurry of publicity, he has stuck it out, determined to get to the end of what has become a very long road. I take my hat off to him for his perseverance. At this point in time, I have an over- whelming feeling that a higher intelli- gence is not only helping mankind, but is trying to save us from ourselves. Perhaps it is Mother Earth herself? Or our new neighbors that as yet we haven ’ t met? We may see the outcome; we may not. Whatever or whomever that higher intelligence ultimately belongs to may not have unlimited patience, especially if they were around when the dinosaurs inhabited our planet.

When some said the world was a sphere, we took no notice and still be- lieved it was flat. When someone put forward the theory that the Earth went round the Sun and not the other way round, we did not believe it. If we had at least listened to minority thinking, it could have sped up all our learning pro- cesses over the last 2,000 years or more. Instead we usually ignore them. When minorities are ignored, the fa- natics rear their ugly heads and all hell breaks loose. We humans should learn to listen and listen to learn.

The book ultimately sold over a half million copies, and was translated into several lan- guages, including Spanish, Italian, Japa- nese, and German. The book was originally Pat ’ s idea. At the time, he had been studying crop circles for eight years, and I had been at it for six. One day, as we were going over the voluminous data and great number of aerial photographs we had amassed over the years, he suggested we should write a book about our findings. We then talked at length about the effect such a book might have on our privileged access to the circles. Many of the farmers had long been supportive and helpful in our research, and we were often allowed access to fields to investigate virgin formations before any- one else was even aware something had occurred. We knew that this situation might change if we went public about the subject. We also wondered about the possibility of damage to crop for mations and to farmers ’ lands if people began traips- ing through the fields looking for crop circles after reading our book. We ultimately decided that it was more important for the public to know about the phenomenon, and so we decided to move forward with the book. Most of the photographs in the book were taken by Pat and I, with a half dozen images contributed by Busty Taylor. I did most of the writing, and the book was pub- lished within six months of Pat ’ s initial idea. We both had a great deal to say about the phenomenon and the information and photos in the book were new and exciting to readers who were just becoming aware of the crop circle mystery. The book ultimately became an inter- national best-seller, and we followed it in 1990 with a sequel, Crop Circles: The Lat- est Evidence , which likewise became a worldwide best-seller. The book generated an enormous me- dia response and it wasn ’ t long before Pat and I were in all the newspapers, on TV and radio, and the book was being talked about in as varied settings as the street cor- ners and the pubs, and all the way up to Buckingham Palace.

The book touched the imagi- nation of people all around the world and it soon became known as the “ Crop Circle Bible. ” Interestingly, in these early days of the phenom- enon, the book was taken quite seriously by both the scientific community and by the media. Today, after decades of counterfeits, and bizarre theories, crop circles have a stigma attached to them and are often Colin Andrews and his co-author for Circular Evidence, Pat Delgado. lumped into the same category as UFOs and Bigfoot sightings.

I was an electrical engineer and a lo- cal government officer in England and, one day, as I was simply driving between my offices, a chance glance out of my car window pulled me into this phenomena. This is a unique situation. I have seen the growth of a mystery which was, at that time, new to the world. I ’ ve seen the “ people problems ” grow with it; and I ’ ve witnessed the media response in all its manic intensity. I have also seen how intelligence agencies on either side of the water have infiltrated the research organizations and I have seen firsthand how they pull you aboard, offer you money to write books on the subject, and all of it is simply to write you off and remove you from the scene. This has been one hell of an opportu- nity, and I have learned by it. As I said, I am an electrical engineer by profession. I went into government dur- ing the reorganization of local municipali ties in Great Britain back in 1974, and I rose through a number of posts fairly quickly. I was fortunate to be given a promotion about every six months or so. My position looked pretty good. Things were looking rosy and then I saw five circles in a field. As soon as I saw my first crop circles, something threw a switch. I was not aware at the time that I walked into that field that, within hours, I was to become one of only three people in the world researching these phenomena. Within days of that July afternoon in 1983, I joined forces with Dr. Terence Meaden, who was, and still is, the head of the Tornado and Storm Research Organi- zation in Great Britain. I also teamed up with Pat Delgado ,who had just retired from his job at NASA tracking the Mari- ner Project at the Woomera Tracking Ranges in Australia and Busty Taylor, a driving instructor and light aircraft pilot who lived in my home town. I became known in the area very quickly by tapping on lots of doors: farmer ’ s doors, military doors, police doors — just about everybody I could get to — asking them what they knew about 05 Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact these things, how long had they been there, and anything else they could tell me. The first thing the farmers told me was that these five circles were not the only ones they had ever had. Almost every farmer whose door I knocked on in that area of southern England told me that their forefathers had had these things on their land, and they had all heard them spo- ken of when they were children. This was concrete evidence that crop circles had been around for at least 30 years. I was then formally approached by a military person who asked me to supply technical and scientific reports — the first reports about the crop circles — to the sec- retary of state for the Margaret Thatcher government. The reports were for a senior man in the cabinet, one of the top five people in Great Britain. The outcome of my three reports was that, in the mid-1980s, an announcement was made in the British House of Com- mons that they accepted that there was a real phenomenon. Their official position was that crop circles were an unusual phe- nomenon, but it was not any type of paran- ormal mystery. A common theory was that they were being caused by a new kind of whirlwind, a new meteorological phenomena, one com- monly referred to now as a plasma vortex — a rotating field of electrified air, which during the night, would account for the golden balls of light people claimed to have seen above the fields in which crop circles appear. I spoke to many of the leading meteo- rologists with whom we were working in Europe, and most of them found it hard to imagine that that kind of phenomena could cause even a single crop circle because of the well-defined cut-off edges, and the lack of damage in crop circles. There was no evidence that that kind of plasma vortex could cause an effect of that kind. Remember that Pat and I and our col- leagues were all investigating crop circles before hoaxing became a part of the scene. In 1989, Pat and I decided to write a book, Circular Evidence . Frankly, the de- cision to write the book took an awful lot of debate and we had many discussions as to whether or not we should, indeed, do this, because we would be “ showing our cards, ” so to speak, and putting the phe- nomenon of crop circles right into the pub- lic domain. But at the same time, we thought it was very important that this should be shared with the public and so we published our book. The result was an extraordinary level of hoaxing. This crop design which resembles a snail first appeared at Cheesefoot Head, Hampshire, England in 1991. (This was found in the same field that I saw my first Celtic Cross formation in 1983.) 05 Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 26"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Path / 27 Chapter 1 The Path 27 A n opening thought: Would man- kind have a collective nervous breakdown if it was revealed that UFOs were real and that crop circles were messages from extraterrestrials? The odds of that being true are unlikely, but even if it were the case, I give humanity more credit: I do not think that we as a species would automatically reject a new neighbor who has sent us a greeting, do you? This is something we should keep in mind as we explore the crop circle mystery. 1.1 In the Beginning “ This is the beginning of something important. ” The year was 1993, and I spoke those words at the Omega Communications UFO Experience conference in North Haven, Connecticut during my presentation on crop circles. During that talk, I described the crop circle formations that had been appearing around the world as “ signs. ” The Mel Gibson movie was a decade away and yet I sensed something was happening, something of a global, and possibly cosmic scale, something I interpreted even then as a sign. Without fully understanding the scope of my jour- ney, I had taken the first steps down a long, and tumultuous path. 1.2 Life Changes After seeing my first crop circle in July of 1983, my life changed in every imaginable way. At that time, I was an electrical engi- neer employed by regional government in Great Britain. My work was based upon traditional science, and I had devoted my career to investigating, studying, and chroni- cling things you can see, count, measure, weigh, and record. I solved problems in a structured, logical manner. And then, in July of 1983, I saw something very unusual, and instantly compelling; something that seemed to exist outside the boundaries of the me- chanical sciences in which I had been working my entire professional life. I was intrigued, and my curiosity — both personal and scientific — was immediately piqued. The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity. — Albert Einstein 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Over the years, I have applied as much hard scientific research practices and pro- tocols to the study of crop circles as pos- sible. I have turned to the disciplines of engineering, chemistry, radiography, phys- ics, and geometry in an attempt to under- stand this phenomenon. I have come to realize that when trying to understand something that may be of paranormal gen- esis, there is as much — if not more — to be learned by the intuitive instincts and abili- ties that we possess, and that many of us ignore and often fail to utilize. I have had some unusual experiences. Many I would classify as paranormal. I don ’ t know how else to explain them. How- ever, throughout my years of study of crop circles, I have always tried to maintain an open-minded approach, and to listen and respond to the intuitive part of my psyche. Over time, I have become more intui- tive. Some might say I ’ ve become more psychic and there have certainly been ex- periences that suggest that I am a differ- ent person in many ways. My life has changed in more practical ways as well. I was doing a regular day- to-day job, which I eventually left as a re- sult of what I saw in the fields in July 1983. I resigned my position to participate full- time in researching crop circles and trying to unravel this mystery. That admittedly somewhat drastic change in my lifestyle was not well re- ceived by members of my family. In fact, my marriage broke down because of my new interest and focus, and because of the time and energy I was putting into study- ing the crop circle phenomenon. My whole world changed literally almost overnight. I had a new group of friends; I was travel- ing constantly and my financial situation went from secure to drastically insecure, again, almost overnight. My first wife and I ultimately divorced and, in addition to this personal trauma, I came to realize that many of my friends and professional col- leagues were embarrassed by me and my work. I was very visible on television in Great Britain in the 1980s, and the unusual nature of my research mortified my former co-workers, many of whom made it quite clear to me that they wanted nothing fur- ther to do with me, as long as I was com- mitted to pursuing this odd line of inquiry. And so, every aspect of my life changed following my first glimpse of the enigma in the fields. Eventually, all of these elements con- spired to have a much larger effect than simply turning one man ’ s life upside down, My work, and the continued appearance of authentic crop circle formations, changed Great Britain itself. I realized that the subject of crop circles was a fuse that I had lit, and I needed to make some deci- sions about how to continue my work. I came to the United States in 1991 to speak about crop circles at a UFO Confer- ence and it was there that I met my wife Synthia. We ultimately married, and we mutually decided that we would live in Branford, Connecticut. I relocated perma- nently to the United States and I now main- tain the home office of Circles Phenomenon Research International out of Branford. I am still pursuing this mystery, but now under a very different set of circumstances. 1.3 Mistakes and Regrets Very early on in my research, one of the biggest mistakes I made was mention- ing publicly the possibility of crop circles being formed by extraterrestrial intelli- gences. In the early days of my investiga- tion, I began to feel that there could well be some external factor creating the for- mations, and that perhaps it could be some form of intelligence. I was not stating with certainty that this possible intelligence was extraterrestrial: It could just have easily been terrestrial in nature. But the media in 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 28"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Path / 29 Great Britain (and later around the world), interpreted my speculations cynically, exploitatively, and in a very sensationalistic manner. They painted a picture of me as an eccentric proclaiming that crop circles were being created by little green men, and I was, as might be expected, ridi- culed and attacked. This caused me tre- mendous anguish and embarrassment. Looking back with absolutely flawless hindsight (as hindsight is always wont to be), I think I would have handled that quite differently. My thinking now is that the media, and by extension, the public, were not adequately prepared for what I was suggesting. The world needed to be educated about the mysteries of cereology, and that knowledge base had not been disseminated widely enough for my more “ unusual ” theories to be ac- cepted, or at least considered, with rea- son and open-mindedness. I should have been somewhat more circumspect when presenting the odder theories. We would have come to these theories eventually: They are all part of the equation. But I now know that I offered cutting-edge ideas too soon. I was looking at something new, and was engaged and motivated, and my entire being was fo- cused on uncovering the truth and on un- derstanding what was happening. I was naive in my assumption that others would be as enthusiastic as I was about the more radical ideas relative to the crop circles phenomenon. I became a target. And today, it is worse, because of the widespread crop circle coun- terfeiting problem. (And as I state repeat- edly throughout this book, hoaxers could not create counterfeit crop circles if they did not have real ones to copy.) I have modified and refined my posi- tion on the possible genesis of crop circles, and yet the resistance by certain factions remains. It is an understandable paradigm: Crop circles and their de facto “ oddness, ” combined with a team of “ artists ” laying claim to actually being the ones respon- sible for them, combine to make the seri- ous researchers of the phenomenon objects of ridicule, who are too often dismissed without being taken seriously. I ’ ve tended to be something of a “ one- man band ” when it comes to making state- ments about crop circles and as to how the “ movement ” to study the formations has developed and acted over the years. I de- liberately, and with great forethought, have worn and continue to wear, this mantle of resp onsibility. This is because I am the one putting myself out there in a very vis- ible position, and I expect to be the one torn to shreds by critics and skeptics. I have worked with a great many people over the years — good, sober-minded, smart people who have contributed greatly to the study of crop circles. These people have helped me at my request: they should not have to deal with being lambasted for my conclusions. If I could do anything differently, I would involve more people in the decision- making process regarding the furthering of the discipline and the directions of the study. I would invite input as to the spe- cific avenues of research we should em- bark upon, and I would consult on what should be stated publicly. 1.4 Sharing the Mystery It is better to understand little than to misunderstand a lot. — Anatole France My instincts and my intuition tell me that an important purpose of the crop circle message is to call attention to what we are doing to our world. We need to wake up and recognize what we have been doing — for far too long — to the earth. Our envi ronment — 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 29"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact the plants, the animals, the waters, the sky — all are integral parts of the earth ’ s ecosys- tem, and we are mistreating every element of this complex and fragile biological total- ity. The element of respect is missing from our behavior: We do not act out of respect for the other living entities on this planet. We are not alone. And yet, we act as if the earth and everything on it exists solely to serve man. The crop circle phenomenon may be, in essence, a wake-up call. Or it could be a cry for help. The day must come when we understand this, and act for positive change. I do not think it is a coincidence that crop patterns have been appearing regularly at places that for millennia have been cen- ters of spiritual focus — places where people have gathered for hundreds and thousands of years for prayer, meditation, worship, and to seek enlightenment. The human quest for peace and higher con- sciousness has often been expressed in outdoor places such as Stonehenge, and in cathedrals and temples. Crop circles often appear in or near these places, and in my opinion, this is a critical part of the overall meaning of the phenomenon. These places manifest an energy that speaks to our inner selves, and crop circles could, in effect, be serving as living signs identifying and calling our attention to these sacred places. Emotions have consequences. Positive emotions that have love as their source, result in positive energies. The exact op- posite occurs with negative emotions. I think that crop circles are giving us all a spiritual nudge, and that they are part of the process of understanding ourselves. Humankind is inching along, with innumer- able setbacks, of course, towards enlight- enment, and a God-centered consciousness. Perhaps by focusing on a common mys- tery, we are creating a unified energy that will ultimately be our salvation. I have met an extraordinary range of individuals in crop circles. They have run the gamut from priests to politicians and everyone in between and the only thing they — we — all have in common, aside from our innate humanity, of course, is the sharing of a mystery. The crop circle mystery brings us all together, and a new bond is created. The process is painfully slow, but it is occurring. My thinking is that this interaction and this common interest — the sharing of the mystery — will ultimately show us that we have so much more in common than we have differences. We all share a living planet, and there is only one race — the hu- man one. We must keep an open mind, and we must eliminate animosity from the equation. We must act with a sincerity of en- deavor to seek knowledge and truth, and to reach a higher place of consciousness and understanding. And most importantly, we must all have faith. I am not speaking solely theologically here. I personally believe that God is dif- ferent for everyone, and that each religion is essentially a different road to the same place. I am speaking about faith that some- thing greater than us exists, and that we have the power and ability to strive for this elevated state of being. We must have faith that there is something beyond us and this planet. Our goal should always be to reach higher. The answers are coming, and they will not come solely from science. We do need to keep scientific inquiry at the forefront of our investigation into the mystery, but we must also allow room for information to come to us through differ- ent doors and open windows. We need to continue to evaluate the crop circle phenomena rationally, scientifi- cally, and logically. We need to continue 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 30"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Path / 31 to measure, and record, and test, and study. But we also need to open our hearts and allow our intuitive side to speak to us. We are moving forward, albeit slowly, but the journey will be well worth the wait. Incredible times await us. 1.5 My Quest for the Truth Only the curious will learn and only the resolute overcome the obstacles to learning. The quest quotient has always excited me more than the intelligence quotient. — Eugene S. Wilson I have long referred to my crop circle research as a quest. The genesis of this feeling was the very moment back in 1983, when I saw the first set of five circles forming a traditional Celtic Cross in a field. I have often said that it felt like a switch was thrown in my stomach. There was an overwhelm- ing emotional and spiritual effect on me, but there was also a palpable physical effect as well. This was quite special and a feeling I have experienced many times throughout my decades of re- search. I was quite conscious of a sense of mystery, of awe, of something beyond our mortal ken. I can recall being overwhelmed upon first seeing the formation, and I also re- member how this feeling grew inside me as I walked closer to the circles. The awe and wonder embraced me like a white light permeating every cell of my body. This powerful sense of mystery trig- gered a resolve in me to learn as much as I could about this phenomenon. It did, in- deed, become a quest. It became a quest for understanding and for truth. A part of this process has been the re- alization and the acceptance that my work with the crop circle phenomenon may be part of a larger plan for me. I say this because of something that happened when I was around 12 years old. This did not happen to me, however, but to my parents and younger brother. The time was the late 1950s. I lived with my parents and my younger brother in England near Salisbury Plain, not very far from Stonehenge. On Sunday after- noons, we would often pile into my dad ’ s old jet-black motorcar and go for a drive. The fields and landscapes of that part of central southern England are absolutely glorious, and we all found a leisurely drive to be quite a respite from the bustle of the previous week. One particular Sunday afternoon, for some inexplicable reason, I chose not to go with my family for our weekly drive. I remained home while my parents and my younger brother headed out in dad ’ s motorcar. Off they went, and from what I was told, the drive started out as quite normal and very pleasant. Then something extraordinary hap- pened and, to this day, I regret that I was not with my family at the time. As my dad was driving in the country- side, just northeast of Stonehenge in a very remote area near an ancient English manor, they came upon a narrow country lane, which was no more than the width of one vehicle. As my dad drove carefully down this lane, a disk-shaped object suddenly appeared over the top of some conifer trees along the side of the road. The object was swaying from side to side in the air, and it was perfectly visible to them all. The road was next to an open field and there was a clear line of sight to the stand of trees over which this object hovered. My father stopped the car and he and my brother got out and walked to the side of the road. They were less than 100 yards from this object and both had a very clear 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 31"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact view of it. It was a silvery craft and, as they watched, it began to rise up. My mother, who had remained in the car, be- came very frightened at this and began calling to my father and brother, pleading with them to get back in the car. She later told me that she was afraid that the craft was going to fly right at them, and she des- perately wanted to flee the scene. As she shouted at my father and brother —“ Get back! ” she cried — suddenly a narrow beam of white light shot out of the bottom of the craft, and then the UFO took off. It shot away incredibly fast over the top of the trees and my parents recalled that it veered slightly to the right as it flew away. It did not just vanish, or “ pop out. ” It flew away at an extraordinary rate of speed. In fact, my parents later told me that it moved so quickly that they were unable to follow it with their eyes. They were ada- mant about what they saw: a solid object was there one minute, and then it was gone. My father and brother hurried back to the car and they sped off home. As soon as they entered the house, they told me what had happened and, even at the age of 12, I was strangely affected by what they had experienced. As they told me of their UFO encounter, I felt somewhere deep inside that I should have been there with them. Never for a moment did I doubt their story. Aside from the unconditional trust I had in my parents, I also knew, even then, that these were credible people telling of an incredible event. Now, fast forward to 25-years later. A mere 15 miles from where my family had seen the UFO, I had my first crop circle sight- ing. All of what had happened to my parents and my brother came flooding back to me. At that time, I actually reexperienced the emotions of that day back in the 1950s — not only those of myself, but also what my par- ents were feeling as well. Here I was, seeing markings in a field, and I couldn ’ t help but wonder if, somehow, that it was related to that UFO sighting from so long ago. This time, however, the event was not transitory, and it was not elusive. It did not “ fly away. ” This time, I was being pre- sented with something physical, something that could be measured, and photographed, and tested. Something that remained in the fields until it was plowed under, patient and quiet, allowing me to take all the time I needed to study it. I knew then that I was being given an assignment: a mission. It was, and still is, a mission of understanding. It has become my quest. 1.6 Answered Prayers I have long believed that our minds are part of the crop circle phenomenon. Human consciousness is a force unto it- self, and I believe that it is possible, per- haps even necessary, that humans as a species work towards positive use of the power of enlightened minds and higher consciousness. One of the most important events in my life was the manifestation of a crop formation after I consciously wished for it to appear. Could this even be possible? That is the question I asked myself following this experience. And yet, the facts are the facts. Shortly after my introduction to the crop circle mystery, I began to ponder deeply, thinking about what they meant, and asking myself why I seemed to be drawn to them. One night in the mid-1980s, in the early years of my research, I asked for a crop formation. Some may call such a request hubris; some may call it folly. At the time, I was (and still am, for that matter) ardently seeking understanding and knowledge about these unusual manifestations in the fields and, thus, I boldly requested that a crop circle appear for me. 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 32"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Path / 33 I asked for a Celtic Cross formation — four circles surrounding a center circle with a concentric ring through the center of the four satellite circles — and I asked that it ap- pear as close to my home in central southern England as possible. A Celtic Cross had, to the best of my knowledge, never appeared before. I visualized the cross in my mind, and I sent out a request for one to appear in the fields near my home. The exact formation that I had visual- ized in my mind did appear in a field near my home — the only field in the area that had not yet been harvested. The field was approximately four or five miles away from where I lived, and the farmer who owned the land called me the morning after I had made my “ request. ” A few days after visit- ing the site, I realized that the field in which the cross had appeared was the closest field to my home in which it could have ap- peared. Because all the fields in the area had already been harvested, the Celtic Cross appeared in the closest field possible. I was stunned by the response from whatever intelligence is creating these de- signs. And yet, I feel that this is much too special for me to claim as my own. How- ever, it did appear at my behest and the odds of it not being associated with my psychic request are quite slim, indeed. This experience — combined with oth- ers that have followed — convinced me wholeheartedly that our minds are part of the phenomenon. And I believe that we are getting closer to the truth as each year goes by. 1.7 An Evolving Puzzle Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored. — Aldous Huxley More than a decade ago, I used the term “ evolving ” to describe the increasing complex- ity of crop circle formations. I was seeing changes in crop formations that clearly indi- cated an evolution in design and intricacy. In the early days, at the start of our research, the patterns in the fields were quite simple: single circles of varying sizes. But then a single circle was joined by a smaller circle nearby; and then we saw three in a straight line; and then five form- ing a cross. And then, in 1986, we saw the first rings around circles. On May Day 1990, for the first time, we suddenly saw two circles connected by a straight line. It cannot be denied that these pat- terns have been evolving before our eyes, and they have also been expanding in their geographic distribution. Their reach has now extended to almost every country on earth, and the density of reports within individual countries has also been on the rise over the past several years. The unavoidable conclusion is that the phenomenon is evolving, and this has convinced many people around the world — many of whom were long-time skeptics — that the crop circle mystery is real, and that it has meaning. The simple has now become com- plex; few has become many; random has become commonplace. Logically, this kind of measurable evolvement — this gracious unfolding of spectacular beauty — must have a purpose, and I believe that purpose to be the transmit- tal of some kind of information. The phe- nomenon is moving towards something; perhaps towards many things, and its increasing complexity and its insistence on making itself known through bolder and more widespread formations, may have great import for mankind and the future of this planet. It is my belief that the meaning of the crop circle mystery has evolved into some- thing that needs to be understood by man, and that this message is important and should not be ignored. 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 33"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact We began by not knowing anything be- yond the fact that we were looking at flat- tened plants in a circle. We now know that hundreds of plants flattened into a series of forms creating an overall geometry — the Julia Set (Chapter 6) comes immedia tely to mind — arises from the science of fractal mathematics. We know that all of nature is comprised of fractals and that we can see their geometric patterns in everything: from the Nautilus mollusk shell, to the spiraling arms of the galaxies. The science of fractal mathematics describes a geometric pattern that is repeated endlessly at ever small scales to produce irregular shapes and sur- faces that cannot be represented by clas- sical geometry. Fractals are paradoxes. Using nothing but squares and straight lines, a curve can be created. As the squares decrease in size, a graceful spiral curve is created by con- necting specific points of the smaller and smaller boxes. This spiraling “ infinite curve ’ can be found in flowers and other natural forms, and its proportions have been used in art and architectures since man first scratched symbols onto cold cave walls. We do not know how or where this will end. I have long believed that the most im- portant “ door opener ”— the “ Eureka mo- ment ”— will be when we are able to fully understand not only the meanings of the individual patterns, but also the meaning of the designs within the context of all the authentic worldwide formations. Place- ment will become a key factor in tying ev- erything together, and where designs appear will become as significant to the overall meaning and understanding of the mystery as to what particular patterns appear in any given year. For instance, seemingly random occur- rences will become meaningful. Circle A will appear around the time of Event B, which will take place near ancient archaeo- logical site C, and all of these clues will come together and give us the answers we are seeking. At some point in the future, the crop circle phenomena will have done its job and we will all fully understand its true purpose. That moment has not yet arrived however, and so we must continue our work, and continue to open our hearts and minds to the enigma in the fields. 1.8 Spirituality and Crop Circles The first act of awe, when man was struck with the beauty or wonder of Nature, was the first spiritual experience. — Henryk Skolimowski I have often used the term “ spiritual nudge ” to describe what I consider to be one of the fundamental purposes of crop circles. Throughout recorded history, man has responded to symbols in a spiritual way. The symbol of yin and yang, the mandala, the cross, the symbol for infinity, and other stylized, geometric designs have long been used as aids to meditation, prayer, study, insight, and personal growth. Meditating on these symbols expands consciousness and opens the door to spiritual growth. Religious symbols create a certain state of mind in people, often described as feelings of well-being, serenity, and a sense of the mysterious. These are aspirations towards higher consciousness, towards enlighten- ment. Crop circles often appear near an- cient archaeological sites that were once used for prayer and meditation. People visit these sites and almost always come away feeling rested and at peace. Is there a con- nection? There seems to be. The crop circle mystery may very well be part of a broader spiritual plan, con- ceived by authors who, so far, prefer to remain anonymous. Why would mankind need to be given a spiritual nudge? The world is a tinderbox. 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 34"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Path / 35 On any given day, a war is raging somewhere on our planet. There are hate crimes, kidnappings, political torture, ter- rorism, pollution, poverty, starvation, geno- cide, assassination, embezzling, drug addiction, domestic violence, illiteracy, rape, murder, homelessness ... . The list goes on and on and on, and it all adds up to one undeniable fact: The world needs a spiritual nudge; a push to- wards the higher aspirations of peace and enlightenment. An important fact to keep in mind when attempting to fully understand the crop circle mystery is that the phenom- enon not only manifests itself in beautiful geometries that speak to the human yearning for harmony and brotherhood, but also that these magnificent pictograms are formed with an obvious respect for the plants involved; they embody a non- destructive modus operandi that does not kill. This “ regard for life ” is unquestion- ably subliminally communicated to those who experience crop circles, and all re- port being fully aware that they were in the presence of something mysterious and special. Simply seeing these formations elicits this identical feeling of well-being. People in aircraft flying above the fields have re- ported a sense of serenity when looking at crop formations from above. There seems to be absolutely no difference between the effect of the crop circles on people from the ground or from the air. We are living in difficult times. Every- one knows this. And we are all searching for answers. Right after September 11, 2001, attendance at churches around the world rose dramatically for a spell. The yearning for answers, and the longing for peace is everywhere. Perhaps the crop circle mystery ’ s pur- pose is to move mankind into a mindset in which the most positive elements of human nature will be brought to the forefront, and acted upon with passion. 1.9 Intelligent Design? Let us permit nature to have her way; she understands her business better than we do. — Michel de Montaigne I believe that there is an intelligence behind the creation of crop circles. It is apparent to me that intelligent design is visible in the authentic formations; the “ hand of an author, ” if you will. The placement of these designs seem purposeful to me: it is clear that they were intended to be seen, and that their beauty and fascinating geometric patterns were intended to intrigue us, and to stimulate us. This again speaks to intelligent design and deliberate purpose. Bolstering this view is the fact that there is consistent, ongoing interaction be- tween the phenomenon and the research- ers; some might say the phenomenon responds to the researchers. There have been cases involving the design and placement of formations that argue against simple coincidence. For in- stance, there are reports in the literature in which an identical pattern has appeared a few days after the original pattern was plowed under. Why? And what can this mean? This has only happened when a for- mation was destroyed before researchers had a chance to study it. Again, it is as if the intelligence behind the mystery wants to be sure that those who are paying atten- tion receive all the information they are attempting to communicate to them. We do not know the nature of this in- telligence. I have been lambasted in the past for using the word “ intelligence ” somewhat imprecisely. I was excoriated because many people interpreted my use of the word “ in- telligence ” to mean aliens. Extraterrestrials. 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Thus, I use the word cautiously now, and when I do, I am careful to explain that “ intelligence ” can mean many things, and that I am not specifically referring to E.T. coming down and making crop circles. For instance, there is an intelligence to the human immune system. This complex biological system continually evaluates threats to the human body and, in a sense, “ decides ” when to respond to danger and attack the intruder. This type of automatic, non-human “ thinking ” goes on in varying degrees of complexity and sophistication throughout the entire spectrum of life forms. I am using this analogy vis-a-vis crop circles to illustrate that it is possible that the manifestations that we all can see — the authentic patterns and designs — could be an autonomic response from the earth, similar to the innate, and undeniably intelli- gent responses of the human immune sys- tem. This does not demand a conscious entity “ wielding the controls, ” so to speak. It simply reacts as a highly functioning biosystem, much like the human body, or the global ecosphere. The concept of intelligence does not always have to include use of tools and the development of language. Nature is intelligent. It reasons, it thinks, it responds. Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, the 12th man to walk on the moon, believes that the universe itself is an intelli- gent, self-correcting entity. 1 Intelligence does not always require consciousness. Sometimes, intelligent ac- tion is simply part and parcel of the matrix of all reality. Notes 1 Stephen Spignesi, The UFO Book of Lists . This formation appeared close to the town of Devizes, Wiltshire, England in the year 2000. The pattern was joined within days by other significant formations in nearby fields. 05a Chap 1.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 36"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"What Are Crop Circles? / 37 Chapter 2 What Are Crop Circles? 37 2.1 Crop Circles: a Definition of Terms Crop circles are circular shapes usu- ally found in cereal crops in which the veg- etation is bent over at right angles and spiraled into an often complex pattern. Au- thentic crop circles show no damage to the plants, unlike hoaxed circles in which the stalks are broken and crushed. In au- thentic crop circles, the plants are gently bent over, yet continue to grow. The plants in faked circles are often killed by the “ circlemakers. ” Initially, in the early years of the 20th century manifestations of this phenom- enon, the shapes were nothing more than simple circles. In later years, the patterns actually became much more complex, and have consisted of combinations of com- plex geometric designs, including straight lines, spirals, angles, and other clearly dis- cernible and recognizable patterns. 2.2 Numbers There have been 3,000 fully docu- mented crop circles that have occurred in the last two decades. In my master data- base of crop circle formations, there are over 10,000 documented formations. There were over 700 crop circles during 1991. This was the highest number of occur- rences during the last 20 years, but on av- erage, approximately 200 crop designs appear worldwide each year. 2.3 Obvious Intelligence It is clear to me that the evidence is growing exponentially that whatever or whomever is involved in the creation of the genuine crop circles around the world has a collective “ mind. ” There seems to be a consciousness at the very source of the formations, and it is obvious that there is thought involved. Where or what that source is at this moment in our history, and They contain information which is as much about our past as our future. They are subtle nudges, tweaks you might say, to our consciousness. The information gives us vital building blocks, which will help with changing our attitudes and actions towards life on our planet. You could say we are looking at our future and as long as we are open to that idea, it will take us to a new place, — Colin Andrews on The Sally Jesse Raphael Show 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 37"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact in the history of the phenomenon, is very difficult to ascertain. However, I believe that we are all involved in a process, the final goal of which is a complete under- standing of precisely what is going on. An integral part of this process is the continu- ing interaction between the events in the fields and the researchers. In some cases, this interaction includes a few of the people that are making some of the formations (that is, the hoaxers). I suspect that we are all players in an enormous cosmic play, and that we all have our part. I do not think that many of us — researchers, farmers, witnesses, and hoaxers — fully understand what our ultimate role will actually be. 2.4 Magic My fascination with crop circles is, in essence and at its core, a deep-rooted be- wilderment. I continually marvel at the lack of human presence, and I revel in the magi- cal atmosphere that exists when I visit these formations. The feeling is palpable. There is something elusive and thrilling at the sites of the authentic formations. I really cannot define it; nor can I measure it, but it is there: a tangible sense of...well, magic might be the right word. What is remark- able about this feeling for me is that, out- side of crop circles, I have only experienced this sense of awe in churches and cathedrals — special places where there is clearly an undercurrent of revelation. Sometimes, some of us seem to be ca- pable of receiving “ transmissions ” from other places, other states of being, other dimensions. Many of us often talk about intuition, hunches, the feeling that some- one is watching us, or the knowledge that someone is talking about us. We seem to have a kind of sensory radar that sometimes allows us to pick up messages that speak to us without words. There is usually no rational explanation for these kinds of ex- periences, but I have personally felt this sense of awareness when visiting authen- tic crop formations, and it continues to fas- cinate me. I am constantly trying to learn more about it. 2.5 Crop Circles of the Past There are many historical accounts of crop circle formations before the 20th cen- tury, some going back many hundreds of years. The first recorded account of an event that has many of the characteristics com- mon to the formation of a crop circle dates from August 8, 1590, and was detailed in a book published in 1686 called The Natu- ral History of Stafford-Shire by Robert Plott. A peasant named Nicolae Lang- Bernhand was walking to his home around midday that day when he noticed some peculiar activity going on in a field by the side of the road. Upon closer investigation, he saw a group of people dancing in a circle in the field. Upon even closer investiga- tion (close enough to see their legs and feet) he saw that some of them had cloven feet. As Lang-Bernhand observed them, the dancers all suddenly rose into the air and disappeared. In the field where they had been cavorting appeared a circular inden- tation, which remained on the ground un- til the farmer who owned the field plowed it under the following harvest time. Accord- ing to Plott, many people from the sur- rounding area visited the crop circle while it existed. No mention is made of what hap- pened to the cloven-foot dancers. Plott also states that powerful whirlwinds rose up during this event, and that one of them was strong enough to pick up the farmer and carry him to a field some distance away. A measure of skepticism is called for when evaluating this account since it was, after all, recounted almost 100 years after it supposedly took place. But even if we strip away some of the more fanciful elements 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 38"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"What Are Crop Circles? / 39 of the story (such as the cloven-foot danc- ers and the daylight vanishing), the essence of the tale is that a crop circle appeared in a field, and many people witnessed it. In John Aubrey ’ s Natural History , the story is told of a school teacher who, in 1633, saw fairies and elves dancing in a field and then spoke of “ the green circles made by those spirits on the grass. ” And later still, recorded in English folklore dating back to 1678, there was reference to an event that many of us to- day might describe as an account of the formation of a crop circle. There are dif- ferences in some of the specifics of the case, but there are too many similarities to a classic report of a crop circle to dis- miss it out of hand. The event occurred in Hertfordshire, England. In writings of the time, the local people speak of a fiery devil coming out of the sky and cutting a circle in a field of oats — again, cereal crops — in a village in Hertfordshire. A woodcut exists of what has come to be known as a “ mowing devil, ” a horned and tailed creature cut- ting through a field of oats with a scythe. The story is told of a farmer who asked a local laborer what he would charge to cut his field of oats. Apparently the farmer was not too pleased with the laborer ’ s estimate, and so they argued, reportedly with great choler and exchang- ing of curses. The farmer had the final say, though, when he declared boldly and with seem- ingly little Christian fear, that he would rather pay the devil himself to mow his field than fork over the exorbitant amount demanded by the worker. “ May the Devil reap it! ” he is reputed to have shouted. The laborer stormed off, the farmer stormed off, and the fields remained un- cut, until later that evening. Supposedly, the farmer ’ s oat field was bathed in a fi- ery light. The following morning, his en- tire crop was neatly cut, arrayed in “ round circles. ” There are many other similar refer- ences dating from the 15th century in En- gland. Many can be dismissed as pure fiction, although one could see the medi- eval mind interpreting natural phenomena as paranormal occurrences. Moving into the 19th century, one of the most compelling accounts of this phe- nomena comes from 1880. In a letter pub- lished in the July 29, 1880 issue of Nature , A 1678 depiction of what many believe to be the formation of a crop circle. 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 39"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact John Rand Capron reports on an anoma- lous event he witnessed in a field near Guildford in Surrey, England: The storms about this part of Sur- rey have been lately local and vio- lent, and the effects produced in some instances curious. Visiting a neighbour ’ s farm on Wednesday evening [July 21, 1880], we found a field of standing wheat considerably knocked about, not as an entirety, but in patches forming, as viewed from a distance, circular spots. Examined more closely, these all presented much the same character, viz., a few standing stalks as a center, some prostrate stalks with their heads arranged pretty evenly in a direction forming a circle round the center, and outside these a circular wall of stalks which had not suffered. I sent a sketch made on the spot, giving an idea of the most perfect of these patches. The soil is a sandy loam upon the greensand, and the crop is vigorous, with strong stems, and I could not trace locally any cir- cumstances accounting for the pe- culiar forms of the patches in the field, nor indicating whether it was wind or rain, or both combined, which had caused them, beyond the general evidence everywhere of heavy rainfall. They were suggestive to me of some cyclonic wind action, and may perhaps have been noticed elsewhere by some of your readers. There are also accounts of crop circles from the early years of the 20th century. After the broadcast of a BBC program on which I appeared and talked about the field in which I saw my first crop circle in 1983, I was contacted by a farmer named Chapel. Mr. Chapel told me that from 1923 to 1925, his farm had been on the parcel of land I showed on the program, and that in that same field, he had witnessed four crop circles form a square. Also, farmers in Whiteparish, Wiltshire saw simple circles in 1946 and 1947. In 1966 in Tully Queensland Austra- lia, farmers witnessed aerial phenomena after which crop circles appeared. Vegeta- tion was seen to spiral and collapse in cir- cular forms. In the mid-1960s at the Stonehenge site, a farmer witnessed simple circles but did not report it until just recently. In that field today, there are complex geometric shapes, a seeming evolution from the simple circles the farmer saw in the mid-1960s. From 1975 on, crop formations have evolved and increased in complexity and geographic distribution. 2.6 Crop Circles and Sacred Sites In 1985, my colleagues and I noticed something remarkable about the geographi- cal location of some crop circles. For years we had been gathering information about the location of circles and their dimensions, and eventually it became clear to us that there were large clusterings of crop circles around what have come to be known as “ sacred sites. ” As we continued to gather the data re- garding the location of the crop circles, it became evident that there were large clusterings of formations around sacred sites in southern central England, particu- larly at Stonehenge, Avebury, Silbury Hill, and other ancient tumuli. My fellow re- searcher Freddy Silva now describes this area as “ the heart of crop circle country. ” In later years, when we began to re- ceive reports from the United States about the appearance of crop circles there, we were not surprised to learn that many of them were very close to Indian burial grounds. 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 40"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"What Are Crop Circles? / 41 This spurred us to look much more closely at this element of the phenomena. Since the beginning of our involvement with the mys- tery, we have had computers continuously looking for correlation in the massive amounts of data collected about crop circles. That research has resulted in two con- nections that stand out dramatically: we learned that many of the crop formations appear close to circular archaeological sites and/or underground water reservoirs. Those are the two major correlations, but with the archaeological connection — the appearance of formations near ancient sites — there is more to it than simply prox- imity. The dimensions of crop formations that are near specific circular sacred sites are very similar proportionally. 2.7 Stonehenge I recall a day back in 1985 when my friend and fellow researcher, pilot Busty Taylor, casually told me something that had occurred to him one day as he was flying over Stonehenge. During his flight, he sud- denly realized that he was looking at approxi- mately the same proportions in Stonehenge as in the crop circles that he had just re- cently begun to see from the air. This was something of a revelatory moment for all of us, but we needed some kind of confirma- tion for Busty ’ s “ hunch. ” For the next six months, we looked again at all the data we had compiled, and we concluded that his in- tuition had been correct. Astonishingly, we discovered that the dimensions of the earliest simple circles, the first circles with rings around them, and the first double circles, were all within centime- ters of the dimensions of the horseshoe semi- circle of the Stonehenge monument. We were looking at the same geometry, the same proportions, the same scale. This has continued, and sacred sites in other countries also reflect this relationship. In Malta, for example, there are churches and temples built with the same “ sacred geometry ” scale and proportions. Throughout history, man has found that certain geometric configurations — many of which are mirrored in nature — are meaningful to us as a species. We don ’ t know the reason for this at- traction — this intuitive appeal or “ pull ” that certain shapes and proportions have — but it is real, and it is common. Certain geometric patterns involving arcs, angles, circles, squares, and other shapes and dimensions are manifested in nature. The perfect spiral of the Nautilus shell is a dramatic example. The Golden Mean is a ratio of angles and squares that create this perfect spiral. And it is an element that is found in many natural formations and living beings. It is our suspicion that the seemingly intentional (or at the least, repetitive) use of the Golden Mean design in many crop circles may be a tool that is being used by some higher power to communicate with us. Are the circular swirls present in many crop circles somehow related to the dimen- sions and location of the pyramids? Is there a connection between the mathematical properties of the Golden Mean and the earth ’ s natural magnetic lines of energy? These questions are still being asked now, decades after the first simple circle appeared, and we are getting closer to a definitive answer. That answer may ulti- mately prove that there is an undeniable connection between a simple nautical shell, the complex spirals of crop circles, and the eternal, evolving universe. Stonehenge, for instance, is believed by many to be a stone monument built on the site of an early crop circle. This theory contends that the ancients discovered a complex crop formation, probably believed it was a divine message, prayed over it and 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 41"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact in it, and then spent years, perhaps decades or longer, putting up giant stone markers exactly duplicating the layout of the origi- nal formation, assuring that this message from the gods, would be visible and re- membered in perpetuity. This theory cannot be proven, of course, but even a cursory examination of Stonehenge ’ s triptychs leads the viewer reflexively to mentally “ fill in the blanks ” where stones are broken or missing. It does not take a great deal of imagination to pic- ture what the original Stonehenge monu- ment might have looked like, and to recognize its similarity to countless crop circle patterns. 2.8 Sacred Geometry “ Sacred ” geometry comprises shapes, equations, dimensions, and ratios that have been applied to designs, art, and architec- ture over millennia, especially hallowed buildings such as churches, cathedrals, and temples; and prayer and meditation designs such as mandalas. The Romans, the Greeks, the Celts, and other early peoples used these sacred ratios in the construction of their build- ings and in their artwork, providing evi- dence of their knowledge of these dimensions, all of which mirror nature — from the spiral of the Nautilus shell, to the spiral galaxies of the cosmos. 2.9 The Triangle There is a geographical triangle in southern central England in which many crop formations have appeared. The exist- ence and identification of this phantasmal triangle is very important to me because I did not recognize its parameters at first. To this day, I believe I was deliberately given a message, which I will explain in detail, to steer me in the direction of understanding its significance. In the early years of my research, I studied crop formations one by one. At that time, I was focused on understanding each new crop circle, and documenting its spe- cific characteristics and details. I knew in- tuitively that there had to be some kind of connection, some kind of yet uncovered nexus that would link them all and perhaps explain what was going on, but my atten- tion was mostly focused on each single manifestation as it appeared. What I did do, however, was mount a large map of England on my office wall and, when a new crop circle appeared, I would place a colored push pin on the map at its location. Each year was represented by a different color pin, and thus I went about my business, placing a pin whenever a new formation appeared. As the months passed, more pins went into the map. But there did not seem to be a pattern or an alignment — at least to my eyes. I was careful to record each new for- mation, but the placement of the pins seemed random and unconnected. There were the occasional clusters of appear- ances, near Stonehenge and Silbury Hill, but I failed to see a particular overall pat- tern to their arrangement. As I continued my research, I would often collect plants and soil from inside crop circles. Usually, these went to labs for analysis; occasionally, they remained with me for a time. During one field trip to a crop circle in Wantage, England on Sep- tember 4, 1986, I took a soil sample from inside the formation, and then left the area precisely at 4:15 p.m. I returned to my home office, placed the soil sample on my desk, and then put it out of my mind as I collated my notes, and tended to household duties and dinner. That night — actually the morning of September 5 — something exceedingly strange happened. 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 42"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"What Are Crop Circles? / 43 Intruder alarm activations began to oc- cur at my home at precisely 4:15 in the morn- ing. My wife and I, as well as our daughter, were always sound asleep, and the alarms would wake us, and, of course, terribly frighten us. Bright lights would blaze on; buzz- ers would blare. Everyone in my house would awaken, as well as several of my neighbors, none of whom, as might be expected, were very pleased about what was happening. This went on for 14 nights in a row. I am an Elec- trical Engineer and have designed home alarm systems, so I checked everything out, and the equipment was functioning perfectly. One night after the alarm went off yet again, I walked, mystified and groggy, into my computer room where I had several computer systems working to record and evaluate all the crop circle data I had been compiling. I kept asking myself why was this sophisticated alarm system repeatedly going off at 4:15 every morning? I sat down at my desk, and my gaze automatically rose to the map on the wall. I had stared at this map countless times, and yet this time, something struck me about the placement of the color-coded push pins. “ What was I seeing? ” I asked myself. What was I seeing? Then it hit me. In a moment of insight that struck me like a cold wind in the face while standing in the middle of a desert, I realized that the locations of the crop for- mations I had recorded in southern central England formed a perfect equilateral tri- angle. The three points of the triangle were Wantage in Oxfordshire, Winchester in Hampshire, and Warminster in Wiltshire, known as England ’ s “ UFO capital ” for its plethora of UFO sightings. The sides of the triangle were corri- dors several miles wide rather than per- fectly straight lines, but the configuration of the triangle was undeniable.

Instead of seeing this obvious design, I had been looking through it for years, and all the while it had been hiding in plain sight. I instinctively knew that this was an exceedingly important development, and so I grabbed my ruler and compass. Plac- ing a point at the center of each of the three towns of the equilateral triangle, I measured the sides of the triangle. The length of each of the three sides of the triangle was 41.5 miles. This triangle has come to be known as the Wessex Triangle and it is still where the vast majority of total worldwide crop circle activity occurs. All the hair on my neck and arms stood up when I realized what this meant. I had been sent a message; a message that had taken me time to comprehend. The 4:15 alarm activations ceased that very day. Experiencing this revelation reached deep inside me, and moved me almost beyond words. I had been sent a message. I believed it then, I believe it now. This acceptance has been difficult for me, and an ongoing struggle. The engineer side of me is always doing battle with my intuitive side. I have repeatedly asked my- self why I did not recognize this myself on my own, without “ help ” from whatever intelligence or force is behind this phenom- ena. This was clearly something I needed to know, and yet I was not able to make the breakthrough myself. It had been dropped right into my lap, and yet I missed it. I have accepted this as a part of the learn- ing curve, but I now try to pay more atten- tion to that intuitive voice when I hear it speak to me. I realize now that not all the answers I am seeking will come from in- tellectual reasoning. This experience convinced me that I was involved in something very unusual, and it was, ultimately, the incident that put an end to my first marriage. At some point during my last day in the house, I stood at the top of the stairs, and I sensed a presence. The feeling was quite vivid and very real to me, but I did not see anything and I did not know what it meant. I carried on with my business, and that was that. I did not sense this presence again for quite some time. However, two years later, something quite unusual happened, and I suspect it may have been the being or spirit from that day when I discovered the 415 link. I was sitting at my desk when suddenly, out of nowhere, a male voice said, quite clearly and distinctly, “ What are you do- ing? ” The emphasis was on the word “ are ” and I immediately interpreted it to mean, I am disappointed — you ’ re not getting it. I have replayed that moment over and over in my mind many times since that day, and I still do not know where that voice came from, or if my interpretation of the question asked of me was correct. Again, the engineer in me began to think techni- cally: I began to muse about how such a voice could be projected in free space, but I knew that this was the wrong approach. The realm of known physics was not the place I needed to visit to understand what had happened. The questioner had imparted informa- tion to me. Yes, a question had been asked, but by the inflection in his voice, I knew that the answer could actually be found within the question itself. I sensed disappointment, and I knew that I was being told that I was erring in my approach to the mystery. I had overlooked the 41.5 miles in- formation and I viscerally knew that I was not paying attention to what was truly important. I was spending days at the com- puter, typing in ratios and dimensions and 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 44"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"What Are Crop Circles? / 45 locations and measurements — mountains of boring, and perhaps meaningless, informa- tion — all the while ignoring the intuitive knowledge being offered to me; the wis- dom being presented to me in the fields themselves, each time I visited a new crop circle. Pay attention, I was being told. This I knew at my very core. Pay attention. Heed your senses. See with your third eye. Listen to your inner voices. And thus I silenced the engineer, and began to seek the truth. A verse from the Upanishads tells us “ He who has found Truth, seeks no more; the riddle is solved...he is at peace. ” And the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu tells us “ the spiritual and the material, though we call them by different names, in their origin are one and the same. This sameness is a mystery — the mystery of mysteries. It is the gate of all wonders. ” Since my experience of being awak- ened to the power of knowing without thinking, I have been trying to truly under- stand the mystery. 2.10 A New Language? A friend of mine who is a well-known authority in higher consciousness and the paranormal recently told me that he was convinced that authentic crop formations were a form of friendly communication because the circles were public, gentle, and benign. He told me he believed that a higher intelligence would choose just such a form of communication because it was not threatening or damaging, and it was also a method that did not require advanced edu- cation or scientific training to understand. He suggested the possibility that the sum total of the genuine crop circles amounted to a new, unknown language that we would ultimately need to translate to understand. I was extremely interested in my friend ’ s thoughts and it occurred to me upon reflection that our own attempt at com- municating with alien life forms (the March, 1972, Pioneer 10 plaque sent into space, currently 7.5 billion miles away from Earth) likewise used symbols and drawings to communicate a message. I do believe that the authentic crop formations are an attempt to communicate, but I am not convinced that “ language ” is the right word to describe the means of communication. Rather, it is a new, symbolic, terralinguistic geography that is intended to arouse emo- tion, and I wholeheartedly agree with my friend that these symbols are intended to be seen. They have been deliberately placed in fields of cereal crops — life-giving vegeta- tion that has been planted by man — and because of their placement, they were guar- anteed to be seen. The natural growth cycle assures that the farmer and his family and crew will return to the fields to harvest their crops; plus, the open fields guarantee that passersby will also see the huge, beautiful agriglyphs etched into the acreage. Pictograms are not found in lifeless desert sands, or scratched into cold, inhos- pitable rocks. They are found in crops that will feed people. And, as we discussed ear- lier, the plants found in crop circles do not die. They continue to grow, often with in- creased vitality. The glyphmakers want to engage us, and now they have. It took us over four centuries to catch on, but now many of us realize we are being “ spoken ” to. We rec- ognize the crop formations as being the means of communication. And we are working enthusiastically to understand the authors ’ message. It has been suggested to me that the designs of all the authentic crop circles in 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 45"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact the world constitute pieces of a massive puzzle, and that man has been given the “ assignment, ” so to speak, of collecting the individual pieces, dismissing the hoaxes, assembling the puzzle, and figuring out its meaning. What I have learned is that there are different crop designs found in different countries around the world, and I suspect that they all may be part of a huge mes- sage to all peoples, being parceled out to us in individual sections. The notion of one overall communication may have some validity. No matter how varied the actual formations found in countries other than England (where the majority are still found), we may ultimately learn that the totality of the information is the same everywhere. In less-developed countries, we find that the designs are less complex than in the more industri- alized regions of the world. And what is that information? First and foremost would seem to be the environ- mental message that the planet is ailing. In all countries, the authentic patterns have arrived as simple geometries that mirror an- cient markings. All are identical in design throughout the world. I contend that this is a deliberate ploy to secure our attention. There is a para- digm in the appearance, presence, and eventual decay or destruction of the crop designs, which I believe illustrates a state of chaos in our natural vegetation, on a glo- bal scale. When one attempts to find meaning in this model, the deterioration of our envi- ronment comes immediately to mind. One of the most convincing elements of this ar- chetype is that the exponential rate of de- terioration of the individual crops in which patterns appear is mirrored by the rate of degradation of the world ’ s crops — as mea- sured especially by the expanding aggre- gate of toxic chemicals in our food. Remember: Many of the designs appear in our world ’ s vegetation that is at greatest risk of damage from environmental impact. There seems to be a deliberate at- tempt to make the message understand- able, no matter where the crop circles appear. I have been working for years to gather all the data I can from all over the world, and make this information avail- able to scientists, engineers, researchers, politicians, and other interested parties. I believe it is important to collect all the pieces and make the sum total of the in- formation readily available to anyone who wants to see it. I do believe that the overall message will only make sense when we see all the pieces of the puzzle. 2.11 To Every Season, Turn, Turn, Turn... I am frequently asked about what hap- pens to crop circles. Because there is of- ten an emotional component involved for people who have seen, or who have been inside crop circles, there is great interest in their fate when the seasons change. I am asked, “ Do farmers simply plow them un- der? ” Is there ever an effort made to per- manently preserve crop formations — and is that even possible? The sequence of events that plays out with the crop circle mystery is all part of nature ’ s way, and, personally, I consider it quite a wonderful cycle. As we have seen, crop circles and pic- tograms appear in cereal crops, which means that they are, in a sense, in our food. Life-giving grains are the paints and the earth is the canvas the authors use to form these incredible designs. Nature ’ s way is for seed to be planted, crops to be grown and harvested, and then food to be made with the harvested grain. One cannot help but wonder if this is all part of the plan. 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 46"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"What Are Crop Circles? / 47 The force creating the authentic crop for- mations must be cognizant of the cycle of planting, growing, and harvesting; it must be aware of the change of seasons and the cold slumber of the earth in the winter. Crop formations appear in grown crops where they will be most visible, but where they will soon disappear. I have always sensed an inherent re- spect in the crop circle mystery — a respect for this cyclical pattern that results in life- sustaining nourishment. It is also quite revealing to me — and quite important, I suspect — that some crop designs re-appear if the first formation is ignored. We have evidence showing that if someone did not acknowledge a particular formation and photograph it, measure it, and study it, an almost identical design will appear the following growing season. It is almost as if we are being told si- lently to look carefully, think clearly, and try to understand. If the genuine forma- tions are, indeed, a symbolic geographic lan- guage, then perhaps we are being told we should not skip a page — or a chapter. Crop formations are erased from the landscape. What is special one day, is re- moved the next. I think this also signifies that it is not crucial that we understand everything immediately . The energy I have personally felt in crop circles is patient. It is positive and respectful of all life. There is nothing aggressive, nothing threatening, nothing frightening. I believe this is inten- tional, and that the use of the growth cycle as the means of communication is an im- portant part of the message, as well as be- ing the vehicle by which we are being spoken to. 2.12 The Farmers I am often asked about the farmers on whose fields crop formations appear. How do the farmers respond when a crop circle appears in their crops? Are they angry? Do they avoid that area of their field, so as to leave it pristine? Do they ever prosecute trespassers when a known hoax formation appears? Do they welcome visitors? Are they resentful of the attention? Or are the majority of them embracing of the phenom- enon, if not the trespassing hoaxers? There are many answers to these ques- tions, and I will discuss them from two perspectives: the early years of the phe- nomenon, and the way things are today. In the beginning, the farmers were elated when a crop circle appeared on their land. Farmers felt privileged to have been “ chosen, ” so to speak, and they were genu- inely pleased at the sudden manifestation of a crop circle — whether it was a simple circle, or one of the more complex designs. In the early years, farmers considered it an honor. Farmers would gather their families at the site, and they would call their friends to come and visit the wondrous and beautiful creation that appeared in their fields. I have arrived at the scene of a crop circle to find the farmer ushering friends and family members through the formation, acting al- most as a tour guide. That is still the case today with some farmers, but they are fewer in number as the phenomenon continues, and as it con- tinues to be bastardized by the hoaxers, many of whom are well-organized and persistent. The crop circle phenomenon has been going on for decades now, with the major- ity of the formations occurring in the farm- lands of central southern England, and the patience of many of the farmers in that area is growing thin. We live in a world where we expect experts to give us immediate answers.

And that is where the rules change. Crop circles are real, and while we have many theories to explain them, the experts — including myself — are somewhat baffled by this Earth anomaly, this planetary mystery. We have not been able to provide all the answers to all the questions about this ex- traordinary enigma. The crop circles have not gone away. Farmers have improved their se- curity, locked their gates, and put barbed wire around their fields, and yet they still keep appearing. And the farmers ’ resolve is be ing tested. The hoaxers have compounded the problem by treating farmers ’ private prop- erty as public land. And so we have en- tered phase two of the phenomenon, which is marked by frustration and, in some cases, anger. The anger comes when people do not respect the land. Here are hard-working men and women trying to make a living off the land, and they have to contend with people tramping through their fields. Much of the visitors ’ behavior shows a horrid lack of respect. Crop circle tour- ists have left gates open and there have been instances where cattle have walked out onto the highways and been killed. There have been cases where tourists have trod over healthy crops with such careless- ness that they have damaged or killed the plants. In addition to the circus in the fields, there is also the question of liability. Farmers are, in the end, the ones re- sponsible for the safety of the people on their land. When cereal crops are very dry, they are very combustible, and one single dropped cigarette could turn acres of crops into an inferno. One lit cigarette could wipe out 100 acres of ripened wheat in minutes. Fires in the field happen regularly when harvesters overheat, but the difference is that the farmer can usually put it out quickly, and there aren ’ t dozens, or in many cases, hundreds of people milling about at the site of the blaze. In central southern England, there are patterns that have hundreds of people in them at any one time. People come from all over the world to see them, and it is not too difficult to imagine what goes through a farmer ’ s mind when he sees all these strangers walking through his fields. Many crop tourists are quite a distance away from the road when they are visiting and photo- graphing crop formations. If a fire started, and a wall of flames fed by the ripened wheat began racing across the fields, would the visitors be able to outrun it? How many would die? How many would be seriously burned? How much damage would be done to the crops? What would be the farmer ’ s personal liability? Would he lose his farm? These are the questions that run through farmers ’ minds these days. Added to all these liability worries is the added stress of the questions and taunts from friends, relatives, and the public. When a formation appears on a farmer ’ s land, he is often questioned about its au- thenticity. The media has convinced many people that all crop formations are manmade, and farmers have to deal with those kinds of questions, in addition to the accusations that they are the ones respon- sible for the formation. Many of the questions asked of them by friends and the media are outside their 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 48"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"What Are Crop Circles? / 49 realm of expertise. Some farmers are ex- tremely cooperative with researchers and I have been granted very generous accom- modations for my work. Sometimes, farm- ers will harvest around a formation and then allow us in to take our notes and pho- tographs before finishing the field. If they are asked with respect, and we agree to work around their schedule and needs, then many are very helpful. 2.13 Anything for a Price? As a response to the problem of masses of people wanting to visit crop for- mations, farmers, of late, have been agree- ing to allow visitors on their land, but for a fee. Many farmers came to the unavoidable conclusion that they needed to have some means of recompense for the damage done to their fields, as well as for the time they had to spend babysitting camera-laden croppies in their fields. They needed to fig- ure out how to manage the large numbers of people and researchers coming onto their land, and many decided to charge people an admittance fee. As often happens in human endeavors that involve money, the profit motive some- times takes over. This has happened with some farmers who turned their crop for- mations into a money-making business. This has caused problems, finger- pointing, and accusations of profiteering, because most of the farmers who initially began to charge an admission fee said they did so only to recoup their losses. A farmer in Alton Barnes, for instance, sustained damage to his crops worth approximately $650. The formation on his land was one of the first multiple pictograms and he ul- timately collected almost $9,000 from members of the public who wanted to see the formation. Money was made, and it is not an enor- mous leap to imagine a farmer willingly allowing a hoax formation to be made and then charging people to see it. I personally know of farmers who have charged crop hoaxers a fee and then al- lowed them to create a formation on their land. The standard fee has been hovering between $150 and $350. During a recent trip to England, I spoke to one farmer who had allowed crop circle artists to make five formations on his land, and he charged them a little over $300 for each one. The artists needed a place to make them, and they and the farmer worked out a deal. This was all done out in the open and, frankly, I think this is a much better arrangement than crop artists trespassing onto a farmer ’ s land in the middle of the night. In those cases, formations would “ mysteriously ” appear and then researchers such as myself would need to commit resources — money and people — to researching something which appeared unbeknownst to the farmer. When a fee is charged and everyone knows what ’ s going on, it allows serious attention — and the commitment of very limited resources — to the genuine crop for- mations. The artists can do their thing, and we can then devote our efforts to the real thing. Regarding these “ art for a price ” cases, though, to the best of my knowledge, I have not heard of profit being made from charg- ing people to see it, and in the majority of cases, the work is made solely for the pur- pose of creating experiential art. This is quite different from deliberately having a formation made, passing it off as real, and charging people to see it. I do not know of one single case where a farmer has actually encouraged people to come onto his land and make a crop circle for financial gain. Personally, I fully support farmers charging an access fee to their land. The exchange of money for a service is noble and just, and it allows me and my fellow 06 Chap 2.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 49"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact researchers (as well as the interested pub lic, of course) admittance onto private prop- erty without the fear of having a gun pointed at our backside.

There have been many reports of golden lights seen above fields in which crop circles later appear. Sometimes, the lights are reported above existing crop circles. What are these lights, and do they have anything to do with the making of crop circles? These lights, which are known as the Avebury Lights because of their prevalence in the Avebury area of central southern England, are self-luminous and can be seen during the day. They have an amber, or golden color at night, and are approximately 14 inches in diameter. A great deal of film footage exists of these lights and I myself have five “ movies ” of them, showing them moving around seemingly purposefully. They have also been captured in still pho- tographs on 35 millimeter film. They do not simply float; they flit about above the fields and there have been times when I felt like they were reading my mind and responding with specific movements. Sometimes, they appear as silver balls, and I have gotten the impres- sion that they were made of aluminum or stainless steel, or some other flatly reflec- tive white metal. These lights are so ubiquitous that ac- counts of them exist in English folklore and there is actually a hill near Alton Barnes, near the East Field in Wiltshire known as “ Golden Ball Hill. ” We do not have any evidence that these golden lights are involved in creating crop circles. And yet, they seem to be around quite often in areas where crop circles ap- pear. Thus, the evidence is circumstantial and anecdotal, but there certainly does seem to be some kind of association.

Mason There are definite biological changes to crops taken from crop circle formations believed to be authentic. William C. Levengood, an eminent biophysicist at the Pinelandia Laboratories in Michigan, has looked at the plants from crop circles from many countries for a num- ber of years. What he has discovered is that the internal structure of the plants is changed at the cellular level, and that the cell pit walls within the structure of the plants are fractured and have expanded. What is important about these findings is that this effect has most assuredly not been replicated by human beings tramping on plants. Along the length of cereal crops are “ knuckles ” known as nodes. These nodes What is a scientist after all? It is a curious man looking through a keyhole,the keyhole of nature, trying to know what ’ s going on. — Jacques Cousteau allow the plant to return to the vertical po- sition if they are somehow placed in the horizontal position during their growth period. These nodes normally expand slightly during growth, and this expansion is a common effect known to farmers all over the world. The nodal expansion in crops taken from within crop circles is extremely un- usual when compared to normal nodal ex- pansion: the ratio of expansion is greatly increased and this effect is specific to crops found in what are believed to be genuine crop formations. This greatly amplified nodal expansion, again, can not be dupli- cated by counterfeit circlemakers stomp- ing around a field with boards and twine. According to Levengood, the largest expansion occurs in the center, and to a lesser degree, around the periphery of the circles. There is a profile of enlargement that is proportional to the profile of the real crop circle from which it was taken. This ap pears 07 chap 3.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 51"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact to be an explicit connection between the geometries of the master circle and the di- mensions of the nodal expansion. And once again, this is not found in hoaxed circles. Interestingly, Levengood has also de- termined that there is magnetic material impregnated in some of the plants from authentic crop circles, as well as in the soil taken from around those plants This magnetic material, to date, has only also been found in a small number of meteorites. This would suggest that the construction of crop circles involves ener- gies from outside our planet and that some high-energy event may have been respon- sible for impregnating magnetic meteoritic material inside the plants from crop for- mations. Levengood has posited that microwave radiation could cause many of the expul- sion cavities and nodal changes found in crop circle plant stalks. In fact, as part of his research at the Pinelandia Labs, Levengood was able to duplicate the spe- cific nodal changes by exposing normal plants to microwaves. However, one ele- ment of the changed plants he could not duplicate through microwave exposure was the genetic changes to the nodes found in crop circle plants. Further work needs to be done, but the early results seem to indi- cate that some type of microwave radia- tion, perhaps a form of energy still not fully understood, may be responsible for the changes in crop circle plants. Levengood ’ s research has been criti- cized by skeptics, mostly for the allega- tion that he has not conducted much of his work in a double-blind manner. Thus, be- cause the very core of his research prac- tices are challenged, any results he obtains are cavalierly dismissed as unreliable. Closer study of his work is revealing, however, and regardless of the skeptics ’ immediate rejection of even the possibility of a crop formation being “ non-hoaxed, ” there are distinct and quantifiable results in The changes seen in starch crystals from plants taken from crop circles. 07 chap 3.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 52"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Undeniable Evidence / 53 Levengood ’ s findings that are not found in known hoaxed formations. There is a great deal in Levengood ’ s work that should be taken seriously. He has written over 50 peer-reviewed papers, and I know for a fact that he does not embark on a research protocol recklessly, or with less than the highest standards of control, monitoring, and recording. Seed heads collected from plants in- side crop circles suspected of being authen- tic were malformed, and yet often manifested speeded-up germination. Rapid, widespread heating of the nodes is present in crop formations that show no evidence of a human hand. The negativity of ardent skeptics, in my opinion, does more harm than good. Skep- tics proceed from an agenda that states unequivocally that paranormal events are impossible, that they do not happen, and that anyone who believes they do or takes them seriously is at the least, deluded, and at the worst, crazy. From my experience, I have deter- mined that there are two types of skep- tics: Type A and Type B. The Type A ’ s are malfeasant in intent and deliberately interfere with research and progress within any field of endeavor. Their mindset is one of malice, and they work diligently to stifle progress. The Type B ’ s, on the other hand, are open-minded (albeit ar- dently skeptical), and their input is essen- tial for rational debate. Why would a scientist of the caliber of William Levengood, the holder of five patents — obviously, a serious man — com- mit time, resources, and his reputation to studying something that is nothing but a fantasy? Levengood is one of those cred- ible people, and I, for one, am not so ready to dismiss his work and his findings as nothing but a silly waste of time. Perhaps he does not have all the an- swers. Perhaps his research could be more extensive. Perhaps some of his findings are controversial. But who does have all the answers? The skeptics? I doubt it. And what re- searcher couldn ’ t use more time and money to expand their work? And if some research results are perplexing and eyebrow- raising, well, isn ’ t that what the quest for truth is all about? All that said, however, I am doubtful that the truth about the crop circle phe- nomenon will ever be fully understood using just science. As I state repeatedly throughout this volume, the answers may lie within us, and require looking through the lens of the soul, as well as the lens of the microscope. 3.2 Radiation Some years ago, the Center for Crop Circle Studies (C.C.C.S.) commissioned a research project in which radiation was measured in crop circles that were believed to be authentic. Some unusual radioactive isotopes were found in a number of these crop circles. The analysis of the results was done in a U.S. Government laboratory and, after the findings were made public, the prevailing opinion was that they were very unusual and further research was recommended. And then something odd happened. Within a few days of the announce- ment of the findings, the government labo- ratory that had performed the analysis suddenly backpedaled and announced that a contamination within the laboratory had been discovered, and that they now believed that the results on the isotopic readings were a result of lingering contamination from an earlier experiment. The tests were not repeated, and I now believe that this clearly is something that needs to be looked at again. Currently, as it stands, the report was nullified by the claim 07 chap 3.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 53"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"54 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact that contamination had resulted in incor- rect conclusions. Personally, I have been carrying a Gei- ger counter into crop circles for many years, and have yet to discover anything truly unusual. 3.3 Robust uh, Growth? I would like to discuss briefly one of the more unusual “ benefits ” attributed to spending time inside crop formations: ro- bust erections. This has come to be known as the crop circle “ Viagra Effect, ” and there have been men who have reported becoming aroused and achieving an erection while walking through certain crop formations. These claims have also been made about certain sacred sites in England such as Silbury Hill, which is in the center of “ crop circle country. ” There is specula- tion among the believers that there is a strong connection to the archetype of the Goddess at Silbury Hill, and that a power- ful female energy — reported by both men and women — is present there. I myself have felt this energy while visiting the site. As for erections, however, I believe that they are purely psychosomatic; that is, they are created by the believer ’ s mind. When someone is told that something might be possible, in many cases, this be- comes unquestionably possible in their mind. And, thus, if someone walks into a crop formation believing that they may get an erection, in many cases they do, in- deed, get an erection. Does this mean that it was caused by the energies in the crop formation? Per- sonally, I tend to doubt it, and I myself have never had that type of physical re- action during any of my visits to the al- most 3,000 sites I have been in around the world. I do know men who have claimed they have gotten erections while standing inside a crop circle, and who completely believe it was caused by the formation, but I think it was due more to their mind than the circle. 3.4 Full Circle I know of breweries in Connecticut and California in the United States that brew beer from grain harvested from fields in which a crop circle has appeared. Also, cereal crops in which formations appear are commonly harvested and then used to make bread. I am often asked if I think there is any potential risk to humans from consum- ing food and drink made from “ crop circle ” crops. Not only do I doubt that these foods can hurt us, I suspect the exact opposite is actually the case. The plants from au- thentic crop circles are certainly healthier and more vibrant than ordinary plants, and they are larger and have better color and formation. Levengood has conducted re- search that has shown that crop circle plants can grow up to 40 percent larger than ordinary plants, that their root struc- ture is 40 percent stronger, and their grain is markedly healthier. So, all that considered, it would seem to me that, if anything, crop circle food and drink might be better for humans than ordinary foods, although, as far as I know, there has not been any scientific testing to support this belief. I myself have not eaten bread from crop circles, but I drank crop circle beer. The two breweries currently making crop circle beer both use barley plants from East Field crop circles in Wiltshire, England. Regarding crop circle bread, I recall one particularly unfortunate incident from my career, during which I got into quite a bit of trouble with the British farmers and England ’ s National Farmer ’ s Union. 07 chap 3.p65 2/11/03, 4:46 PM 54"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Undeniable Evidence / 55 Back in the late 1980s, I was doing a great many television in- terviews in England.

I expressed concern about the possible un- known effects on humans from eat- ing food made with crop circle plants, and I opined that perhaps the farmers should set aside these crops and not sell them for con- sumption. I took quite a verbal thrashing for that one, and I was accused of scaring the public need- lessly, and also of threatening the livelihood of the farmers. Since then, I have been very careful about such statements, and, as I have stated, I have drunk crop circle beer and am no worse for the partaking.

We also have two other references from the late 1600s that are ex- tremely similar. Around 1923 or 1924, a farmer farm- ing Cheesefoot Head in Southern England, saw four crop circles in the very same field as I saw my first five circles in 1983. The farmer had seen me on a BBC televi- sion program talking about this particular field, and he wrote me a letter teling me that he had had circles in the same field back in 1923. He was not the first to step forward. We have had many farmers tell us that crop circles have been appearing on their land for many, many years. These firsthand, eyewitness accounts validate our data. This is not random. There seems to be something impor- tant about certain locations. The same fields are revisited time and time again and, in three specific cases in my files, they appeared on the same iden- tical spot. Clearly, location is important, but we have not yet discovered why. Crop circles frequently appear very close to water. I have found a 90 per- cent correlation between the appearance of crop circles and the existence of un- derwater aquifers. Also, the vast major- ity of patterns appearing worldwide are within 40 miles of Stonehenge. Many, many crop circle formations are conglomerated in that area, a place notable as having the highest level of an- cient circular archaeological sites in the world.

It is a fact that crop circle manifestations are real and that there is scientific evidence to prove that there are differences between the plants in hoaxed formations and the plants in authentic mani- festations. But because crop circles don ’ t really do anything — other than appear in the fields and stun the senses with their beauty — science has been loath to commit time and resources toward explaining and understanding them.

This theory suggests that the living Earth is com- municating through natural energies that can be glimpsed in the complex grid of 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 61"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact alignments of sacred sights and areas of paranormal influence around the world known as ley lines. This theory is based on the Gaia Theory, which was first hypothesized in 1970 by the scientist Timothy Zell, and expanded and refined by the British chem- ist James Lovelock and U.S. microbiolo- gist Lynn Margulis in 1972. In 1979, Lovelock wrote the seminal book, Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth , which pro- foundly changed the way scientists, as well as ordinary people, looked at life on earth, and the life of the earth. Is the earth “ alive? ” Is the planet a functioning life-form that breathes, repro- duces, and responds to threats by complex biochemical self-defense mechanisms? And if the answers to these questions are “ yes, ” can crop circles be a conscious — or, at the least, autonomic — response to atrocities committed against the planet by man and all our endeavors? And again, if the answer to the question of whether or not the earth is a living entity is yes, is it possible for the earth to die? What would be the fate of mankind and all the other lifeforms inhabiting this blue planet if that should happen? The Gaia Theory proposes that our planet is not simply a mass of lifeless rock flying through space; not simply a “ lucky accident ” in the cosmic scheme of things. In 1929, Rus- sian scientist V. I. Vernadsky foreshadowed the development of the Gaia Theory 1 : Life appears as a great, per- manent and continuous infringer on the chemical “ dead-hardness ” of our planet ’ s surface ... .Life therefore is not an external and accidental development on the ter- restrial surface. Rather, it is inti- mately related to the constitution of the Earth ’ s crust, forms part of its mechanism, and performs in this mechanism functions of paramount importance, without which it would not be able to exist. Is the living planet earth having prob- lems with the support mechanisms that sus- tain her? From David Orrell ’ s essay, “ Gaia Theory: Science of the Living Earth ” 2 : Three billion years ago, bacte- ria and photosynthetic algae started to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, producing oxygen as a waste product. Over enormous time periods, this process changed the chemical content of the atmosphere — to the point where organisms began to suffer from oxygen poisoning! The situation was only relieved with the advent of organisms powered by aerobic consumption. Orrell also reminds us that the heat of the sun has increased by almost 25 percent since life began on Earth, and yet the at- mospheric temperature has remained ap- proximately the same. How has the earth compensated for such a significant increase in heat, and kept the temperature within the ideal range for all lifeforms on the planet? Lovelock and Margulis discovered a number of regulatory processes that they described as feedback loops which, in ef- fect, served to cool the planet. One ex- ample is the cycle in which soil bacteria removes carbon dioxide from the atmo- sphere. Soil bacteria is more active in hot- ter temperatures, so as the sun ’ s heat increased over the eons, soil bacteria in- creased their activity, the net result of which was a continuous cooling of the planet. Life responded to a threat by adapt- ing its own biochemical processes as a defense mechanism. If the earth is a living organism, crop circles may be a response to injury.

The Gaia Theory is one explanation for the phenomenon. I find great merit in the Gaia Theory and believe that even if it does not ulti- mately explain the crop circle phenom- enon, it makes an important contribution towards educating the public and making us all more environmentally conscious. One of my colleagues recently sug- gested to me that the crop circle hoaxers, along with those who fixate on what per- centage of crop formations are fakes and what percentage are real, are completely missing my point. He believes that my en- vironmental concerns are often over- looked in lieu of an obsession with the numbers. I understand his point, and I agree that oftentimes my environmental message takes a back seat to the paranor- mal aura persistently attached to the crop circle phenomenon. I think that our attention should be on our wounded planet, and I think that the crop circles may be a way for nature, or some unknown intelligence, to redirect our focus back to the environment — where it used to be by all peoples in the pretechnology eras. In those days, there was a direct link be- tween the environment and life; people knew it, and they respected this. The weather, the land, the animals, the crops, the trees, the waters — all were integral components of survival. Technology has moved modern man several degrees of separation away from this way of life. When there are al- ways loaves of bread on the grocery store shelves — loaves that have been baked, sliced, packaged, and dated for freshness — it is very easy to forget that before the final product of the loaf of bread reached you, cereal crops had to be grown, harvested, ground, baked, and shipped to the baker. Crop circles appear in plants that will be used for food. This is quite blatant: Look at these beautiful designs; they are in fields of crops; you will one day eat these crops. Pay attention to that which sustains life. Are we learning to respect the planet? Have we learned to use wisely the plants and the animals given to us? I do think that as a species we are thinking more about our actions and their effect on other lifeforms, but I don ’ t think we are doing anywhere near enough. Today, there are pockets of environ- mentally-aware communities, both in the United States and around the world, where people recycle, have more respect for trees, and take into account the im- pact on the foliage and the water when planning buildings and roads. But it is not widespread enough and we need to do more. There is an increased aware- ness, especially in the Western world, of environmental matters, and this is some- thing we need to cultivate (pun intended) and expand. My own feelings about the planet go very deep. I am privileged and honored to be in regular contact with a great many scien- tists, engineers, politicians, writers, profes- sors, and native peoples in different parts of the world, and from many different walks of life. I hear over and over from these diverse people that the earth is suf- fering from extraordinary damage. James Gustave Speth is Dean of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, and he provided me with the following alarm- ing facts about our planet and the species that inhabit it: • The rate of extinction of birds and mammals today is estimated to be 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 63"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"64 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact 100 to 1,000 times the rate that spe- cies naturally disappear. • For 20 years, tropical forests have been cleared at the rate of one acre per second. • One-quarter of all species of birds are now extinct. • Half of the available freshwater on earth is being consumed and most people will soon live in water- stressed areas. • For more than 20 years, 15 million acres of agricultural land has been lost every year to desertification and soil degradation. • An estimated half of the world ’ s wetlands have been destroyed. • Forty years ago, 5 percent of the marine fisheries were overfished. Today, that figure has risen to 70 percent. • Industrial processes that fix nitrogen at rates that exceed nature ’ s has re- sulted in 50 oxygen-starved ocean dead zones, including one in the Gulf of Mexico the size of New Jersey. • Professor Jane Lubchenco, newly elected president of the International Council of Scientific Unions recently stated, “ The trajectory we are on is not sustainable. We are definitely de- stroying the life systems of the planet. ” And speaking of native peoples, ap- proximately 15 years ago, the Kogi people came down from their mountain in South America where they had lived for centu- ries, to meet with a journalist from the BBC. This was the first time in 300 years that they had spoken to their “ Younger Brother, ” which was their term for the white man. They came down to report that snow had stopped falling on their mountaintops. They desperately need this snow for wa- ter, irrigation, and other life support pur- poses. Because of this, the tribe had to relocate, and one of the members spoke to a reporter to express their deep con- cerns for the health of the planet. The Kogi believe that all the terrible changes oc- curring on the planet are from the actions of Younger Brother. These people have never taken up arms and are a very quiet, spiritual people. For them to take such a drastic step as leaving their mountain and speaking to those in civilization, their fears and concerns had to have been profound indeed. I share their view. We now see that it is not just those mountains in South America. Climatic changes are accelerating at an extraordi- nary rate. We are damaging our home. I feel very deeply about this. Ten years ago, I was optimistic that a new thinking was taking hold; a new environmental awareness that would spur critical changes — and hopefully before it was too late. Today, I am sorry to say that I have an intuitive sense that it might now be too late. Around the world, temperature and precipitation records are being broken ev- ery day. Have we upset the fragile ecologi- cal balance necessary to sustain life for the long term? Our planet is under attack. And I re- ject the placations of those who tell us we are simply in a turbulent period of a natural cycle and that the earth has been through this before, and it will adapt as it has in the past. We have the d ata. The earth has never been through what it is going through now — the pollution, the toxic emissions, the excessive extinctions. This is something different, and to fix it is going to require a major change in our thinking as a species — 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 64"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Theories / 65 what is known as a paradigm shift. A new generation of politicians must take the reins and assure the survival of mankind and all our allied species. The British movie A Place to Stay , (which is reviewed in this volume), makes the point that the earth is the place where we must stay — there is nowhere else to go right now and, so, if we destroy this home of ours, where will we live? The day may come where we colonize other planets and have several more “ places to stay, ” but right now, this is it. There is a theory of late that posits that we quite simply cannot harm our planet beyond repair. Why? Because the oil we burn is from dinosaurs who died and be- came part of the ecology. Thus, this theory goes, we are doing nothing more than ex- tremely long-term recycling. Anything we pump into the ecosphere, no matter how it has been changed, is still part of the bio- logical aggregate and, therefore, cannot hurt the planet, or anything living on it. It is a closed loop, according to this theory. Much of this makes perfect sense. But this closed loop theory requires a self- contained, closed atmosphere within which cycles repeat over and over. And that is where this theory comes undone. Manmade chemical compounds — combinations of el- ements not found in nature — are thinning the ozone layer that protects us from ultra- violet rays. This adds an unknown variable to the equation and opens the closed loop. The fully analyzed 2001 data shows the most serious situation to date over the Arc- tic. There was a minor positive deviation in 2000, but the mean curve is negative over- all. This speaks powerfully to the serious degradation of the ozone layer, and the po- tential — and still not-fully-known conse- quences — of such deterioration. Almost the entire continent of Austra- lia is, today, almost completely exposed to ultraviolet radiation because of the hole in the ozone layer above it. I think this is an extremely serious situation and one that is often either minimized or ignored by both scientists and politicians. And the average person couldn ’ t care less about the hole in the ozone layer. It does not affect his or her daily life. And that is true. But what happens when this exposure to UV rays takes its toll, and we start to see the worst droughts in history, devas- tating floods that seemingly come out of nowhere, and extreme storm periods un- like any we have seen before ‚ not to men- tion the real possibility of serious birth defects? And we are not talking about a cen- tury from now. We are talking about major ecological and environmental problems for our grandchildren, and their children. Whether or not the Gaia Theory is the true explanation, or, in fact, the only ex- planation for crop circles has yet to be de- termined. But there is great merit, and long-term benefit, in opening the door to the notion that Mother Earth might be try- ing to tell us something. I do think it is in our best interest to listen. 4.2 Magnetism Another theory that attempts to explain crop circles involves the earth ’ s magnetic fields. Over a period of five years, and con- tinuing today, I have been conducting mag- netometer surveys in the proximity of crop circles and inside the circles themselves. I have been measuring the earth ’ s mag- netic field in circles in central southern En- gland and, in a small number of circles, we have recorded increases in the earth ’ s mag- netic field by approximately 120 percent. Incredibly, that increase, when mapped out by computers, shows the same magnetic fingerprint — the identical pro- file — as the crop design over which it has been measured. 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 65"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact This is very significant. These findings have allowed us to cal- culate that the dipoles — the pair of electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite polarity that would produce that level of magnetism — are buried at 20 feet below ground or, surprisingly, suspended 20 feet above the ground. The level of magnetism we recorded was maintained for a period of several days. This was not a momentary event. It oc- curred over a period of time. We could see nothing in the sky, and the British Minis- try of Defense did not permit us to exca- vate that particular parcel of land, so we were unable to determine with certainty the source of the magnetism. Localized fluctuations in the earth ’ s magnetic field are thought to be a major element in the creation of crop circles. This theory presumes that there is also some kind of unknown energy field — perhaps a “ brother ” to magnetism — that is also at work and is the actual force that flattens the plants. As we have seen, unusually high lev- els of magnetism have been measured in- side some crop circles which, when mapped out into a distribution profile, re- sembles the actual crop circle design in which it was measured. There is speculation that a high rate of rotational acceleration of this magnetic anomaly creates a force that creates crop circles. There is concrete evidence to support this theory. It is a known fact that plants thrive and that their growth rates increase inside elevated magnetic fields. Also, many human beings can detect magnetic fields. It is thought that these “ human magnetom- eters ” have this ability due to the iron con- tent within their human hemoglobin, which is constantly provided to every cell in the human body through the blood. They de- tect and interpret magnetism as feelings of well-being and, in some cases, they mani- fest improved health, or even healings. Even the glowing “ globes ” described by some crop circle witnesses, and which many believe to be UFOs, could be ac- counted for by this process. One of the common arguments against the magnetism theory is that, if it were true, then we would have had manifestations and accounts of crop circles throughout all of recorded history, not just in the past few hundred years. At first glance, this does have some semblance of sense and logic, but on deeper analysis, we find that there are flaws with this argument. My challenge hinges on the fact that the earth today is not the same as it was hundreds and thousands of years ago. We do not have all the facts regarding ancient geology, the state of the primeval eco- sphere, and exactly what the climate was like before recorded history, but we have certainly acquired a great deal of informa- tion from the ice cores, the fossil record, and from scientific models. One conclusion we can state with cer- tainty is that thousands of years ago, the planet earth was not in the state it is today. There is something new going on. The climate is mutating; the environ- ment is changing at an accelerated rate, and this change can be seen in the composition of the ice cores, located around the world at both poles, and in Greenland, China, Russia, and South America. The United States Geological Survey describes the mountain of information re- corded in ice cores: Ice cores contain an abun- dance of climate information — more so than any other natural recorder of climate such as tree rings or sedi- ment layers. Although their record is short (in geologic terms), it can be highly detailed. An ice core from 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 66"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Theories / 67 the right site can contain an unin- terrupted, detailed climate record extending back hundreds of thou- sands of years. This record can in- clude temperature, precipitation, chemistry and gas composition of the lower atmosphere, volcanic eruptions, solar variability, sea- surface productivity and a variety of other climate indicators. It is the simultaneity of these properties recorded in the ice that makes ice cores such a powerful tool in paleoclimate research....Over the past decade, research on the climate record frozen in ice cores from the polar regions has changed our basic understanding of how the climate sys- tem works. Changes in temperature and precipitation which previously we believed would require many thousands of years to happen were revealed, through the study of ice cores, to have happened in fewer than 20 years. These discoveries have chal- lenged our beliefs about how the cli- mate system works. We have been required to search for new, faster mechanisms for climate change and we have begun to consider the inter- action between industrial man and climate in light of these newly re- vealed mechanisms. 3 One of the valuable pieces of informa- tion we have acquired from our study of the ice cores is that carbon dioxide (CO) levels in the atmosphere are higher in the past 30 years than they have been in the past 500,000 years. The topmost centime- ters of the ice cores show this and, while we do not know precisely what the long- term effect of this increase in CO 2 will be on the biosphere and on human survivability on earth, the fact that such a monumental change in the environment has happened within an infinitesimally small (in geologic terms) period of time cannot, in this researcher ’ s opinion, bode well. And this also bolsters my argument that it is impossible to make judgements about the possible existence of crop circles in the distant past, based on the state of the planet today. It has long been my contention that the recent crop manifestations are a sign, and perhaps a symptom of a major, and per- haps tragic, change in the earth ’ s biologi- cal health. I myself am an electrical engineer, and I have consulted with physicists, paleobiologists, and other scientists, and we are all in agreement that the earth ’ s magnetic field alone cannot be causing the plants in crop circles to collapse to the ground in swirled, sometimes complex patterns. There is obviously some other element to the equation, again, perhaps that unknown brother to magnetism, or some type of byproduct of magnetism that combines with other earth forces to provide the lateral force necessary to create these designs. This is one theory, and we may ultimately learn that it goes hand in hand with the Gaia Theory and that the final, persistent message is that the earth — and every living creature on it — is in danger. A moving magnetic field will induce a current and if that current has some other type of energy applied to it, it can achieve lateral movement that could cause plants to collapse in an organized manner. But what is this unknown “ other type of energy? ” Intelligence, perhaps? And as I mentioned earlier, I was stunned to discover that in one case, a mag- netometer reading I took within a specific crop circle was a mirror image of the de- sign of the crop pattern itself. This was as- tonishing and baffling at the same time. 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 67"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"68 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact So there is some kind of as yet uniden- tified distortion going on, in which the earth ’ s magnetic field is manipulated, per- haps deliberately, to cause rapid lateral movement of the energy waves and cause plant collapse within seconds. 4.3 Life Force Energies Another theory, and yet another corol- lary to the Gaia hypothesis, is that esoteric, indefinable forces commonly described as “ life force energies ” are creating the pat- terns. This theory states that anything and everything that is alive — human beings, ani- mals, insects, plants, and indeed the planet itself — in some way sustain life on earth by working with an interconnected life force energy, and that when any one component of this complex paradigm is in significant danger of not being able to adequately sus- tain itself, there is a reaction, part of which could be the appearance of crop circles. Austrian physician Wilhelm Reich (1897 – 1957) identified this vital life force as orgone energy, and he believed it was the force that explained all processes in the biosphere — from gravity to nuclear energy. The life force theory suggests that the human race as a species, being the domi- nant life form on the planet, and having the most complex and sophisticated mor- phology, somehow recognizes, at a subcon- scious level, that the earth is in danger, and that all life on the planet is threatened. We somehow sense this in our primal forebrain, in our primeval limbic system where there is sense memory of our earliest genetic existence. Crop circles are, in this way, constructs created by our subconscious and with interplay from other lifeforms, in re- sponse to perceived threats to our aggre- gate existence. Orgone is the energy permeating everything and perhaps the collective unconscious is manipulating this energy to create crop patterns for a multi- tude of urgent reasons. 4.4 Underground Water Another theory is that the large reser- voirs of underground water in the earth ’ s geo-structure, all of which expand and con- tract depending on the amount of rain that falls, create a static charge that builds up and ultimately discharges at surface level, and that the configuration of these specific electrical charges create the crop circle patterns. In recent history, this expansion and contraction rate has been greater due to global warming and changes in the weather systems, and this increased volatility of water levels may be responsible for anoma- lous electrical discharges. Crop circles could be an effect of these discharges, much the way desert winds create patterns in sand dunes. There is supporting evidence for this theory, specifically the fact that an over- whelming majority of the authentic crop formations around the world manifest in very close proximity to underground aquifers. 4.5 Microwaves One of the most intriguing theories regarding the formation of crop circles is the theory that microwave radiation is re- sponsible for the changes found in the nodes of plants in crop formations. Mi- crowave radiation is suspected as caus- ing the explosion or swelling of the nodes of individual stalks of crop circle plants and vegetation. Microwaves — which are between infrared and shortwave radio waves — are high-frequency electromagnetic waves, one millimeter to one meter in wavelength. Low levels of microwaves are emitted from almost everything on earth. It has been demonstrated, for instance, that if two tin cans are placed next to each other, they 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 68"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Theories / 69 will connect to each other with straight lines of microwave radiation. Likewise, trees can link to other trees using microwaves, and people can sometimes subliminally commu- nicate with each other without speaking through the unconscious, yet quite real, exchange of low levels of microwaves. Have you ever felt like someone was look- ing at you and when you turned, someone was? Some researchers believe that in in- stances such as these, the “ watcher ” is emitting trace amounts of microwave ra- diation that is being received by the person being watched. Something autonomic is triggered and a message is sent to the brain telling us we are being observed, and that we need to evaluate this monitoring as ei- ther being a threat, or as being harmless. At these levels, however, it is unlikely that there would be enough microwave en- ergy in nature to cause plants to collapse. Also, microwaves do not move laterally with force, and lateral movement and patterning is commonly seen in crop circle formations. Microwaves could be responsible for the swollen, or exploded nodes of plants from crop formations. The microwaves could rapidly heat the moisture locked in- side a plant node and cause it to boil and blow out the node. But is there an identified process in nature that could generate enough micro- wave radiation to create a crop circle? No. Therefore, it is my opinion that even if microwaves are involved in some man- ner — its presence suggested by the ex- ploded nodes — microwaves in and of themselves are not strong enough to bend crops and create a pattern. Some interesting experiments have been conducted with plants and microwave ovens. Plants have been placed in a micro- wave and, when the oven was turned on and the plate rotated (thereby creating lat- eral movement), the plants did bend them- selves into a spiral pattern. But the plants died, and there is also nothing in nature that can create the concentrated levels of mi- crowave radiation emitted by a microwave oven. In the fields, the plants do not die. 4.6 Plasma Vortices and Whirlwinds Another theory is that meteorological atmospheric vortices — some previously unknown, weird new whirlwinds — are re- sponsible for the formations. This theory likewise ties into the Gaia Theory since it is generally assumed that these pattern- forming vortices are a manifestation and response of a changing global environ- ment; a damaged, struggling environment. The vortices most commonly credited with the creation of formations are wa- ter and plasma. Water vortices are air and water in a rapidly spinning whirlwind carried across the land, leaving behind circles and other patterns in the cereal crops. Plasma vortices are spiraling col- umns of electrified air which, on impact with the vegetation, likewise create pat- terns. The analogy for this process would be electrocution. The plasma vor- tex electrocutes the plants into a circu- lar form, the source of the final design ultimately being a natural meteorologi- cal phenomenon. But, realistically, can such an unfo- cused, intermittent meteorological event be responsible for any crop patterns be- yond the simplest of circles? Probably not, and yet there is enough evidence, most of which has come from Dr. Terence Meaden, to credit these vortices with some of the plain, unadorned circles. 4.7 Aliens Make Them: ETs and UFO Landing Sites There has long been a great deal of speculation that crop circles are formed 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 69"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact when alien spacecraft — be they visible or invisible — land in fields. In fact, the earli- est appearance of crop circles in Australia were originally called “ saucer ’ s nests ” be- cause of this belief. I myself have not seen or interviewed anyone that can provide evidence that UFOs are actually responsible for the cre- ation of crop circles. However, that said, there are many reports and a number of very impressive films showing spheres approximately 14 inches in diameter mov- ing in the fields where crop circles have already formed. I don ’ t believe this is at all coincidental. These particular spheres are rarely seen outside of crop circle fields. There is one case, which will be discussed later in this volume, where a man claims to have seen these spheres actually mak- ing crop circles. I do not think we yet have the evidence that UFOs are making crop circles, but there is definite evidence — both on film and by eyewitnesses — that they are in the proximity and appear to be “ showing an interest ” in what ’ s occurring. There are approximately 50 eyewitness accounts by people who claim to have seen crop circles forming. I have interviewed many of them, and none claim to have seen UFOs in the sky when the crop circles form. A CIA remote viewing project in which the participants all had documented remote viewing abilities, concluded that the crop patterns are intended to serve as “ sign posts, ” informational postings by one ex- traterrestrial species to another and that human beings actually have no part in the phenomenon whatsoever. That particular experiment concluded that crop formations are not intended for we Terrans. Of course, that conclusion has been challenged by other theories. I would rule out the notion of complex crop circles being formed as a physical impression in a field created by the landing of a UFO, although we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that some simple, single circles could have been created by the landing of a craft. Another theory is that extraterrestrial beings are making crop circles. The authentic crop formations boast of intelligent design. There is no denying that. The earth ’ s real crop circles, the ones that appear in astonishingly brief periods, and which show no evidence of crop destruc- tion, appear to be well thought out and de- liberately designed. There are some who contend that aliens are the architects and authors of these formations, and that they have somehow always been involved with the phenomena. The belief is that the crop circles are some form of communication from an extraterrestrial species. If this is the case, the extraterrestrials ’ message is still being erratically communicated and is undeniably ambiguous. 4.8 Messages From the Dead? Another theory, which is a relatively new line of thought and actually quite bi- zarre in my opinion, is that crop formations are communications from the dead. The emergence of this theory may simply be a response to the ongoing popularization of talking to the dead, commonly seen in books by self-described psychics and chan- nels such as James Prager and John Ed- ward. Prager writes books in which he reports on his conversations with the de- ceased, and John Edward hosts a very popular television show on which he deliv- ers messages to audience members from their departed loved ones. Is there any validity to this theory as it relates to crop formations? Mathematicians assert that the dead are creating crop circles in specific geometric ratios to get our at- tention. Eventually, the theory goes, a code will emerge from the various authentic for- mations that will reveal something of great 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 70"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Theories / 71 import to mankind. Thus, the dead are act- ing as couriers of some important message for the living. Obviously, this theory needs continuing investigation, as well as some hard evidence for it to be considered a vi- able hypothesis. Oliver Lodge There is some evidence, however, in the story of Oliver Lodge and his possible posthumous communication using crop circles, that bolsters the credibility of this theory. Lodge was a scientist and spiritu- alist who demonstrated the possibility of transmitting radio waves, work which led to Marconi ’ s development of true wireless communication. Lodge believed in the sur- vival of the self after death. In the article in this volume, “ Diatonic Ratios in Crop Circles ” by Gerald Hawkins, we learn of the relationship between the di- mensions of crop circles and the Western musical scale. Professor Hawkins also ex- panded his research into the diatonics found in crop circles by taking the musical notes he had decoded in the circles depicted in my book Circular Evidence , and applying letters to the notes, using a method known as the Boethian Method, named for the fifth century Roman philosopher, Boethius. This system of encoding — applying let- ters to musical notes and concealing them within a composition — has been used by musical composers for centuries. In fact, in Johann Sebastian Bach ’ s final fugue, he hid the letters B-A-C-H repeatedly. When Hawkins applied the Boethian to crop circles, he came up with a set of initials over and over. The initials were “ O.L. ” Later, he also learned that other sets of ini- tials that he had “ translated ” belonged to colleagues of Lodges, including several board members of the spiritualist organiza- tion he founded. Was this Oliver Lodge attempting to speak to us from the beyond using crop circles as the “ instrument ” of communica- tion? Lodge had stated emphatically throughout his life that he would commu- nicate with the world after his death. Are the “ O.L. ” initials his? And if so, what is Lodge trying to tell us? 4.9 Government Satellites Another theory that has been men- tioned lately, and which has not been con- clusively disproved, is that government satellites — high-tech satellites in orbit all around the world, launched by many gov- ernments — are projecting an energy that constructs crop patterns. Personally, I do not believe that gov- ernments are involved with the phenom- ena for one very simple reason: the crop circles phenomenon pre-dates airborne technology by centuries. Crop formations were here long before man invented the satellite. Let ’ s put aside the anachronistic prob- lems with this theory for a moment, though. The notion of governments deliberately beaming some kind of energy ray into ce- real crop fields to create complex geomet- ric patterns begs the question, “ Why? ” What could a government gain from such an exercise? • Would it provide a strategic edge in global politics? No. • Would it provide some type of military advantage? No. • Would there be economic benefits to be gained? No. Would crop circles and the resulting dis- cussions and investigations further some long-range plan of one or more governments that warranted the time and expense to cre- ate them? Possibly, but if this is the case, there haven ’ t been any stunning revelations that would support this theory. If “ government- made ” crop circles ultimately convinced a 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 71"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"72 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact population that money should be spent to de- fend it from some unknown extraterrestrial threat, then conceivably such a plan could be underway, but thus far, my conclusion is that this theory is nothing but conspiracy-tinged speculation with no evidence whatsoever to support it. 4.10 Snow Circles and Ice Rings Snow circles and ice rings, both of which are quite rare, have been discovered in the mountains of Turkey and Afghani- stan, in Canada and Germany, and in the United States on the frozen Charles River outside the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology (MIT). Snow circles manifest visual similari- ties to crop circles, except that instead of plants bending over and forming a geom- etry, snow or ice is displaced to form a rec- ognizable geometric pattern. One of the most complex ice rings to date is the aforementioned design on the Charles River. The river froze, and a thin layer of snow covered the ice. MIT Professor John C. Marshall, quoted in the February 24, 1993, issue of the MIT publication Tech Talk , stated, “ One of us ventured onto the ice and...in the bitter cold we started speculating about what was happening. These specu- lations included: frozen-in eddies spawned by the sluggish flow of the Charles over the bottom, point sources of effluence issuing from submerged pipes, wind driven patterns akin to the ‘ crop-circle ’ phenomenon common in the summer in Wiltshire, England... ” These theories notwithstanding, many of us believe that the ice rings on the Charles River were part of the same phe- nomenon as the crop circles. Other than the “ wind-driven ” component of his specu- lation, two of Dr. Marshall ’ s theories in- volve the movement of the river. In February 2001, a perfect ice ring formed on a small pond near Churchill, Maryland. The formation measured approximately 30 feet across and consisted of a ring with a spur extending from its outer edge. Appar- ently, this design was very similar to a pic- togram which appeared in a barley field in Hampshire, England in 1987. In 1998, several ice rings and snow circles appeared and were photographed in Germany, and the photos show quite clearly that the circles are in an expanse of virgin snow, in that a footprint would be quite visible. 4.11 Crop Circles and Cattle Mutilations: Is There a Connection? Some of the more speculative (and, truth be told, imaginative) members of the UFO and crop circle communities have suggested that there may be a connection between the appearance of crop circles and the mysterious cattle mutilations that oc- cur on some farmers ’ land. I would like to state unequivocally for the record that I do not believe there is even the remotest link between the two phenom- ena. In fact, I think they are diametrically opposed to each other, in both purpose and in energies utilized. In all my years of research, I have come across only one incident in which the mu- tilated carcass of a cow was found on a farmer ’ s land in proximity to a crop circle. I myself have personally investigated first- hand over 2,500 crop formations and have never come across a cattle mutilation. In the case I am referring to, a farmer in the United States reported that one of his cows had been eviscerated in the manner most often associated with the phenomena (and most often credited to UFOs): its blood had been removed, there were well-defined, surgical incisions that were done with high heat, believed to be a laser, and the cow ’ s internal organs had been removed all the 10 Chap 4.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 72"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Theories / 73 way down to their nerve attachments. There was a single crop circle nearby, within a hundred feet or so, but the carcass was not in the circle itself. I consider this single event — out of a reported 10,000 crop formations around the world — to be nothing but a coinci- dence and totally unrelated to the crop circle phenom enon. As I said earlier, the energies are quite at odds with each other. The forces behind cattle mutilations are dangerous, harmful, and callous towards life. The crop circles are pastoral, benign, and beautiful. I refuse to consider that the two could in anyway be linked. Notes 1 V. I. Vernadsky.

It is not known if this is because of governmental and media censorship, or the actual dearth of crop manifestations. Crop circles are reported in just about every other country, including Russia, the whole of Europe, North and South America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere. In many cases, though, the reports come to us too late for any meaningful re- search to be done.

A new and growing awareness of the phenomenon is reaching even distant places these days thanks, in part, to Ameri- can television shows such as Unsolved Mysteries , which are syndicated all over the world. This geographic distribution speaks volumes regarding the claims of hoaxers.

Let us play devil ’ s advocate, however, and stipulate that a worldwide plot to cre- ate crop circles does exist. This suggests one simple question: What ’ s the point? What would be the point of such an ef- fort? Until the global hoaxers step forth and provide a rational answer to that ques- tion, logic tells us that such a theory is balderdash. ••• This gazetteer provides details on doz- ens of countries around the world where crop circles have appeared in the past sev- eral decades. There are over 3,200 crop circles accounted for here and this total comprises the documented formations in the Circles Phenomenon Research Interna- tional (CPRI) database. The actual world- wide total of crop formations is believed to be approximately triple this number. Sometimes I feel that the earth is a canvas on which the crop circle authors are painting their signs of warning. The regular appearance of crop circles all over the world would seem to substantiate this notion. ( NOTE : The countries are listed in descending order of appearances.) 5.2 England 1,784 recorded crop formations The vast majority of reports in England come from a circular area extending 40 miles out from its center point at Stonehenge. Every year, from late April until early September, circles are reported, and as many as 15 in a single day have been discovered. During the early 1960s through around 1978, only single circles appeared. In 1978, the first quintuplet set was found, and during 1986, the first circles with rings were discovered. From May 1990 through today, com- plex patterns are routinely found. As might be expected, a high level of hoax- ing is also commonplace in England, al- though it is unlikely that crop circle counterfeiters could account for the vast array of formations. 5.3 United States of America 228 recorded crop formations The first reports of crop circles in the United States that made the official data- base came from farmers who watched a 1989 broadcast of Unsolved Mysteries , the first in-depth television coverage of the mystery in United States. Subsequent research has uncovered single circles and single rings across the United States from 1952 through 1989. The first complex design appeared in 1990, the same year as such a pattern appeared in the United Kingdom. Most of the complex patterns in America tend to be sloppy and irregular, and are likely manmade. That said, however, a genuine crop formation appeared in Lyle Spiesschaert ’ s wheat field in Forest Grove, Oregon dur- ing the summer of 2002. The formation consisted of three connected circles topped by a crescent with an attached key-shape appendage. Biophysicist Will- iam Levengood investigated the forma- tion and concluded that it was genuine. In an interview with Lisa Waggoner in the Hillsboro Argus , Levengood ticked off the evidence for authenticity: • Magnetic particle deposits higher than the average of the controls (control areas). Soil within the circle had over 90 times the upper limit found in normal soil. 11 Chap 5.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 76"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Location, Location, Location / 77 • (Wheat) node expansions greater than average of control sets. Of 44 formation sets of wheat stalks, 36 had greater node expansions. • A strong resemblance between its F-shaped downed area and wave guides, constructed metal tubes used to efficiently direct micro- waves or ultra-high frequency energy. • Linear lay patterns in the F-shaped area, rather than circular lay pat- terns as within the circular forma- tion. • Significantly suppressed seed ger- mination from plants taken from within the crop circle, compared to plants outside it. Some media skeptics in the area sus- pected the formation had been made in conjunction with the release of the movie Signs , but Levengood ’ s findings put the suspicions and hoaxer ’ s claims to rest. 5.4 Canada 135 recorded crop formations Crop circles in Canada have generally evolved similarly to those in the United Kingdom, with simple circles and rings appearing back in the 1950s, and the first complex design appearing in 1989. Several dead porcupines have been dis- covered in Canadian crop circles. Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta are the hot spots and, in most years, there are reports from these provinces. 5.5 Germany 105 recorded crop formations There are very few reports from Ger- many of simple circles, and that is unusual. Most of the reports are of complex designs. The very first report of a crop circle in Germany did not come until 1990, and that was a simple circle. In 1998, Germany ’ s peak year for crop circles, more than 25 formations appeared over a period of sev- eral months.

The gold, silver, and bronze plates were approximately 12 inches in diameter and one inch thick and on the top of each plate, the design of the crop pattern beneath which they were found was molded into the metal. The pictogram included symbols that came from German antiquity. Was it all an elaborate hoax? Or were the plates some- how connected to the appearance of the crop formation? I myself held two of the plates in my hand and they were unquestionably au- thentic. The gold plate was melted down before further research into the engraving on their surfaces could be undertaken. 5.6 Australia 71 recorded crop formations Some of the earliest reports of crop circles in Australia came during 1966, and most were associated with official UFO eyewitness reports. In fact, many of the crop circles reported during this period were described as “ saucer nests, ” since many in Australia believed they were evi- dence of UFO landing sites. Since those first reports, many simple circles have been found, but not one com- plex pattern has ever appeared in the coun- try, and that is unusual. In contrast, the largest manmade crop design ever constructed is in an Australian desert. It is called the Marree Man (See pattern No. T691 in the Andrews Cata- logue in this volume); it is two and a half miles wide; and it is visible from outer space. (This design joined the short list of manmade structures visible from orbit. The Great Wall of China is on this list.) In 1971, a former Member of the Aus- tralian Parliament discovered the body of his missing son next to a crop ring at Tellebang, Queensland. There is a very high level of UFO reports associated with crop circles in Australia. 5.7 The Netherlands 62 recorded crop formations In 1997, two intricate crop patterns appeared in the Netherlands, followed within weeks by another 22 reports of for- mations. There have been fewer reports in recent years. A very active location is Hoeven, Noord-Brabant. 5.8 Hungary 23 recorded crop formations Single circles have been reported al- most exclusively in Hungary, except for the These small crop circles were just a handful of hundreds filmed across the English countryside in 1989. 11 Chap 5.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 78"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Location, Location, Location / 79 report of a crop triangle in 1992.

It was not until 1991, when a forma- tion was discovered in a wheat field, that a circle appeared in cereal crop. Several simple circles have been dis- covered in long grass, but most of the crop formations in Japan are found in rice paddy fields. On one occasion during 1990, two de- signs appeared adjacent to each other, making it the most complex formation to date. The designs consisted of a single circle and a circle with a concentric ring around it. Japan ’ s crop formations are generally very simple in comparison to those appearing in many other countries. The numbers of reported formations has been falling since 1991, which was Japan ’ s peak year. Interest in the subject is very big in Japan. Numerous in-depth tele- vision programs air regularly and cover developments around the world. 5.10 Wales 15 recorded crop formations Wales is a principality of the United Kingdom on the western peninsula of the island of Great Britain. Even though it is part of the British mainland, Wales reports far fewer crop circles than in England. The terrain in Wales is not conducive to crop circles. The country ’ s landscape is strewn with large hills and mountains that cover much of its geography. During 1989, an American visitor took a photograph of a field with two circles in it from the top of Goodrich Castle. When the film was developed, there was a strange blood-red ball on the print very close to the circles. The ball had not been visible to the photographer when he snapped the pic- ture. Interestingly, similar “ invisible ” ob- jects have been seen on photographs taken in crop circles elsewhere over the years. 5.11 France 13 recorded crop formations Mostly simple circles have ever been recorded in France, and the number of re- ports have been minimal, with the first stretching back to 1954. A complex pat- tern, believed to be the first one in the coun- try, was reported in 2002. Aside from the dearth of formations, though, there have been some odd crop circle-related occurrences in France. One day in 1964, sometime during the early morning hours, two neighbors witnessed a single circle forming at St. Souplet. The circle formed in a back garden and the two neighbors were awakened by a strange, very loud sound as a bright light moved into the garden. Their bedroom windows were shattered into small pieces of glass and pulverized powder during this event. The circle that appeared after the sound and light was reported to be in a plot of spinach. 5.12 Scotland 12 recorded crop formations Most of the crop patterns in Scotland are believed to be manmade. One particu- lar formation was reported by a man who claimed to have witnessed it form, and who later infiltrated the crop circle research groups and made himself known to me as a CIA operative. This man ’ s “ eyewitness ” claim is thought to be a cover for his clan- destine intelligence activities.

There were three reports of formations in 2002, which was the most reports from Switzerland in a single year. No complex designs have been reported. 5.14 Czech Republic 11 recorded crop formations It was not until August 1994 that the first crop formation in the Czech Republic was reported. Over the next two years, there were another half a dozen reports with increasing regularity, until the number of reported formations peaked at 16 sepa- rate patterns and simple circles during 1999. There has been a steady decline since that year. The largest formation to be reported was 315 feet long (96 meters), at Nemilkov on July 28, 1996. 5.15 Austria 8 recorded crop formations There have been very few discoveries of crop formation in Austria, but the ones that have been reported were very similar to the designs found in England. Several simple patterns have actually been identi- cal to British formations, with a similar quality of precision. 5.16 Italy 8 recorded crop formations Only simple circles and single rings have been discovered in Italy. Most of these were reported during the 1980s and there has been no trend towards evolving complexity, and no reported hoaxing. 5.17 New Zealand 7 recorded crop formations All of the New Zealand formations are almost certainly manmade. A very complex fractal design was made by En- glish artists for an NBC television docu- mentary during 1998. Also, Japan ’ s Nippon Television flew Englishman Matthew Williams to New Zealand with a small team in February 2002 to make two patterns. The reason manmade patterns are so popular in New Zealand is because of their growing season: cereal crops are available in the country during the north- ern hemisphere ’ s winter. Shortly after I appeared on Austra- lian television talking about crop circles, a farmer reported two new crop rings in his wheat field. Only a handful of simple circles re- main unexplained and unattributed. 5.18 Russia 6 recorded crop formations There has been a suspiciously small number of reports for such a vast country, but most are thought to be real. Again, it is difficult to know if this is due to censor- ship or actual dearth of formations. Luminous spheres, similar to the ones witnessed in the United Kingdom, have been reported associated with some of the crop circles in Russia. Interestingly, the Russian Army inves- tigated the reported formations and de- ployed agricultural experts who discovered that the soil under the flattened plants in circles had been baked. Other circles found in the country have shown no evidence of damage or tampering. 11 Chap 5.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 80"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Location, Location, Location / 81 5.19 Finland 6 recorded crop formations All discoveries of crop formations in Finland were made during the period 1996 through 1998, and they were all intricate and impressive geometries.

The first report of a crop circle in Israel came in 1997, and it was accompanied by a UFO sighting. Biophysicist William Levengood analyzed plants from the Israel circle and concluded that the changes he found could not have been the result of a hoax. 5.21 Poland 5 recorded crop formations The only reports of crop circles in Po- land have come in the last few years. The formations reported are mostly simple, well-formed circles, with no damage of any kind. A complex pattern that looked like a flower was found in wheat at Wylatowo Village near Mogilno during July 2002. All of Poland ’ s crop circles have ap- peared in cereal crops. 5.22 Brazil 5 recorded crop formations All Brazilian crop formations are simple designs and appeared in grass and corn. The most complex pattern seen was a quintuplet set — a traditional Celtic Cross — which was found in long grass during the summer of 1996 near the capital city of Brasilia. There have been no reports coming out of Brazil since 1997. 5.23 Mexico 5 recorded crop formations The first report of a crop circle in Mexico dates from 1954, and was of a single circle. During 1993, two intricate designs appeared in long grass, a few miles apart, in the state of Hidalgo. One of these pat- terns was accompanied by a strange sound heard by witnesses on the night it formed. 5.24 India 4 recorded crop formations; 800 possible unreported formations There have been only four reports of crop circles from India that have detailed sketches accompanying them. These circles were reported to me by a scientist with the Indian government, who said that “ huge designs ” had been photo- graphed on the prime minister ’ s land and in other parts of India. This gentleman also claimed that approximately 800 other pat- terns of which he had direct knowledge had appeared across the country. This “ 800 patterns ” quote was cited recently by M. Night Shyamalan during interviews in which he talked about writ- ing the script of his blockbuster movie, Signs . This scientist also told me that the same patterns that had appeared in wheat fields had also appeared in black soot on ceil- ings in some residences in the area, always following a religious ceremony. 5.25 Sweden 4 recorded crop formations In 1946, there were several reports in Sweden of single crop circles.

Following one of my radio interviews in Ireland, an Irish farmer rang me up to report that during 1989, he found four circles forming a square in a remote wheat field on his land. The rivalry between the English and the Irish — often marked by humorous in- sults flung by both sides — caused much to be made by the English observers who crowed that only in Ireland could crop “ circles ” make a square! 5.27 Yugoslavia 3 recorded crop formations Crop circles have been reported in Yugoslavia only during the last two years, and each pattern has been intricate. One of them was the familiar “ Celtic Cross ” design. 5.28 China 2 recorded crop formations; possibly several hundred unreported formations One of the two reported crop circles in China was witnessed during the decade of the country ’ s failed “ cultural revolution ”— 1966 through 1967 — when reporting or discussing such superstitious and possibly paranormal things as crop circles was not only discouraged, it was illegal. According to Zhang Hui, research fel- low of the Xinjiang Museum in Urumqi, an eyewitness saw the second circle form in a very short period of time. This eyewitness was in the company of China ’ s Red Guard in Northeast China when it took place. Hui believes that many of the ancient stone circles in China are permanent mark- ings of old crop circles. This theory is also held by many regarding Stonehenge and other circular archaeological sites in England. 5.29 Other Countries The following countries have reported crop circles: N UMBER OF C OUNTRY R EPORTED C IRCLES Argentina 2 Croatia 2 Denmark 2 Peru 2 Romania 2 Siberia 2 Slovakia 2 Spain 2 Turkey 2 Afghanistan 1 Bulgaria 1 Chile 1 Egypt 1 Isle-Of-Man 1 Lithuania 1 Luxembourg 1 Malaysia 1 Nigeria 1 Norway 1 Sardinia 1 Tasmania 1 Ukraine 1 Uruguay 1 11 Chap 5.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 82"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"83 III Part Stonehenge 12 Part III.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 83"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"12 Part III.p65 2/11/03, 4:48 PM 84"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Crop Circles: Signs of Contact / 85 Madison Square Garden: Insecurity 85 H undreds of crop circles had been appearing in the English landscape when the matter was finally taken to the British government.

There has been controversy about the Julia Set since the moment it appeared in 1996. Naysayers have come forward and claimed to know the hoaxers who made this extraordinary formation. However, they do not name names or provide evidence, thus destroying their credibility. Also, many of their claims have been repudiated by the facts. One of the most convincing arguments for the Julia Set ’ s authenticity is that hon- est, respectable people have attested to its almost instantaneous appearance. These are credible people telling of incredible things. Nowhere is this more evident than in the accounts provided by people who would have nothing to gain, and a great deal to lose, by making up such a story. The realities of nature surpass our most ambitious dreams — Francois Rodin A “ Julia Set ” is, by definition, a pat- tern created using fractal geometry. Fractal geometry is a component of the relatively recent field of chaos theory which, put simply, is the theory that states that order can be found in randomness (early 1960s). A fractal is a geometric pattern that is repeated at ever smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by classical geometry. The Julia Set crop formation begins with a circle, spirals away from that cen- ter circle with smaller circles that grow in size, until peaking as a large circle, and then spiraling down with shrinking circles. Tiny “ moon ” circles orbit each of the circles in the set. The shape of the Julia formation mimics the spiral created by the Golden Mean in nature. A Julia Set can be mapped upwards and downwards to infinity. It is a complex pattern that is visibly awe-inspiring. But is it real? 14 Chap 6.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 87"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"88 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact The story of its discov- ery is simple. A pilot flew over the field at 5:15 p.m. on his way to Stonehenge. With him was a doctor who had chartered the flight to take pictures of the ancient archaeological site. Neither of the men saw anything in the field below them as they flew over it at 5:15. Sometime around 6 p.m., they flew over the same field on their way back to the airport and there it was. An enormous crop forma- tion had seemingly appeared in a span of 45 minutes or less. By 6:15, the police were receiving calls about the formation because of the great number of people stopping on the fast, danger- ous road adjacent to the field to look at the formation. The cynics claim that the formation was already in the field, that it had been created the previous night, and that no one saw it until 6 p.m. the following day. When challenged on their contention that an entire day went by and no one on the road next to the field saw the mas- sive formation, they say it was because the field slopes down and it is difficult to see from the road into the “ bowl ” cre- ated by the inclined ground without a per- son getting out of their car. According to their claim, the formation was created clandestinely and undetected in the area near Stonehenge, which is monitored around the clock by security guards. They also claim that the 600-foot crop design was made in a mere few hours, abso- lutely perfectly, and on the first try. There are solid responses to these al- legations, and I will go through them one at a time. 1. The Julia Set was clearly visible from the highway next to the field and a person did not have to leave their car, walk to the edge of the road, and look down into the field to see it. The local police did not have any notice of the formation until minutes after 6:00 p.m. on that day, the first call coming in to them within minutes of the doctor and the pilot seeing it. It is farfetched to believe that an entire day went by without anyone seeing the The Julia Set seen in proximity to Stonehenge (1996). 14 Chap 6.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 88"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Stonehenge Julia Set / 89 enormous formation — including the farmer who owned and worked the fields. 2. The Stonehenge site, which is across the road from the field where the Julia Set appeared, is guarded 24- hours-a-day by a team of at least three, and often, four professional security guards. These guards can see the field from the patrolled, el- evated ground on the northern side of the Stonehenge standing stones, but they did not see the pattern un- til after 6 p.m. on the day it ap- peared. I personally spoke to all of the guards who were on duty that day and they confirmed that there had been nothing in the field until after 6 p.m. that day. 3. The British Ministry of Defense con- trols the airspace over Stonehenge and also monitors all aircraft take- offs and landings from the nearby top- secret airfield Boscombe Down. Officials from the Ministry of De- fense confirmed to me that the first report of the pattern was made after 6:30 p.m. that day. 4. David Probert, a professional sur- veying engineer who investigated and surveyed the site at my request, used the very latest infrared locat- ing and layout equipment to mea- sure and evaluate the Julia Set formation. He assured me that it would have taken him approxi- mately two full days to lay out the design as found in the field. It took one full day in the field for us to simply enter each circle position and draw it using his equipment. 5. The pilot and doctor ’ s report sup- ports the reports of many eyewit- ness who have witnessed formations form in very short periods of time, some form as briefly as 10 to 15 seconds. 6. The central circle of the Julia Set is directly aligned with the circle that is formed by the Stonehenge formation, and this invisible line passing through the crop formation and Stonehenge is aligned with magnetic north, the earth ’ s mag- netic pole. The placement of the Julia Set is so specific that if there had even been a slight rotation of the formation while it was being formed, then the line to magnetic north would have been misaligned. It seems unlikely that this meticu- lous alignment was purely coinci- dental, and equally unlikely that hoaxers went to the trouble of mak- ing and executing the specific cal- culations necessary to achieve such an alignment. On a related note, it has been shown that psychics have been able to “ sense ” the magnetic alignment of the earth and the Julia Set formation simply by looking at photos of the de- sign. These experiments were con- ducted at the Institute of Resonant Therapy in Capenburg, Germany. The results could not be duplicated with photos of hoaxed formations. These experiments were filmed and personally witnessed by myself and my wife Synthia. 7. The pilot and the doctor are both ada- mant in their belief that if the Julia 14 Chap 6.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 89"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Set had been in the field when they first flew over it, they would have undoubtedly seen it. Both men were looking down from the aircraft at Stonehenge and the fields around it, and the aircraft flew several circuits directly above the field. The Julia Set pattern was enormous: It mea- sured 600 feet across. Not seeing it would be comparable to flying into New York City and not noticing the skyscrapers. 8. Biophysicist William Levengood dis- covered biophysical changes at the cellular level inside the plants from the Julia Set formation, which he be- lieves could not be caused by hoax- ing. An independent analysis at the Springborn Agricultural Laboratories in Massachusetts discovered a five- fold reduction of the pesticide lev- els within plants from the Julia Set. Both of these results are utterly in- consistent with plants that have been flattened by human feet or wooden boards. The Julia Set is a conundrum of anoma- lies and mysteries, and the formation seemed to possess some type of energy in- formation that was used, in several cases, to great environmental benefit. At the time the Julia Set appeared, So- viet president Mikhail Gorbachev was try- ing to find ways to reduce the consequences of acid rain on trees and vegetation in the Soviet Union. A friend of Gorbachev ’ s was working with the Institute of Resonant Therapy in Germany. He designed an ex- periment in which the orgone energy of the Julia Set was quantified, and then gener- ated at specific resonant frequencies on plant life in the Soviet Union. The people conducting this experiment recorded leaf counts before the orgone ap- plication and after, and there was notice- able improvement in the growth and health of the tested plants. This process has since been applied to troubled plant life in other countries with the same positive results. The conclusion we have drawn from this development is that the geometry of the Julia Set formation contains specific bioenvironmental information that can be read and then used to improve the health of vegetation anywhere in the world. It is quite possible that authentic crop circles are part of an interconnected net- work of biological “ machines ” whose sole purpose is to support the life forms of planet Earth. It is also possible that manmade designs which accidentally con- tain certain essential ratios and alignments may also create measurable effects. We can see here a potentially important discovery that has come out of this single event. 14 Chap 6.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 90"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Stonehenge: A Coincidental Discovery / 91 Chapter 7 Stonehenge: A Coincidental Discovery From the Circles Phenomenon Research International Newsletter (Vol. 5, No. 1, Spring/Summer 1996) 91 I n this fascinating article from his now defunct CPRI newsletter, Colin Andrews discusses an odd stone he was “ summoned ” to find close to Stonehenge, and how, later, a never-published glyph on one of the henge ’ s standing stones seemed to connect to the mysterious rock. ••• During the early years of crop circle research, Pat Delgado, Terence Meaden, Busty Taylor, and myself were in daily con- tact and flew weekly over the area of Stonehenge. We were, of course, search- ing for and photographing the crop circles which were found predominantly in this area. Busty Taylor, the regular pilot of our aircraft, had a near fixation about Stonehenge, always commenting that the simple crop circles which were appearing at that time resembled it and even seemed to compare favorably in size. To test these observations, I spent the winter of 1987 scaling the existing crop circle patterns to the official floor plan of Stonehenge supplied by English Heritage, the keepers of the site. I discovered that, indeed, there were striking similarities. The dimensions of most of the single circles fit snugly into the inner horseshoe of the henge and, when crop circles ap- peared with single and double rings, they fit within the inner and outer edges of the first ring of stones. All of these fits were to an accuracy of just a few centimeters. This very famous archaeological site is the cen- ter of crop circle activity, as over 95 per- cent of the known worldwide formations have been discovered within a 40-mile ra- dius of these formidable monolithic stones. In 1996, Stonehenge once again took center stage, both with the proximity of the most extraordinary formation (T444: see the Andrews Catalogue in this volume, and 15 Chap 7.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 91"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Chapter 6, and with the following discov- ery I made last year.

The film was called G ateway to the Unknown and was broadcast throughout the United States with actors dramatizing my situation. When making the film, Michael ar- rived with American psychic Sharon Gayle, who was his friend and assistant. While filming an interview with me in a huge “ dolphin ” formation (see T122 in the Andrews Catalogue ) at Lockeridge, near Alton Barnes, Sharon suddenly broke into the filming and said, “ Colin, they are telling me to ask you to pick up your stone. ” The filming was stopped, the director looked annoyed but agreed, and I, in confusion, looked down around my feet at the hundreds of flint stones par- ticular to southern England. I did notice one that seemed slightly different to the rest, a little to my right. I bent down to pick it up and found it was embedded and weathered firmly into the soil. I had to pry it from the ground with both hands. The surface I could see was round and smooth but when I pried it out and brushed the soil off, I saw something quite different. The stone was a beauti- ful blue found inside broken flint but I could not believe my eyes. I noticed a horseshoe arrangement of white rectan- gular markings within the blue which looked nearly identical to the rock place- ment of Stonehenge. I immediately said, “ My God! It ’ s Stonehenge! ” I have stared at this stone on many occa- sions as it sits in my office, and I have studied all aspects of it.

In July of 1995, I was asked to visit Stonehenge with a group of researchers from the United States who had arranged to tour the crop circle sites and Stonehenge with Joyce Murphy from Beyond Boundaries. My job was to update the group with the latest crop circle discov- eries and research progress as the group spent some quality moments inside the henge with the special permission of English Heri- tage. It was evening, around 11 p.m., and the sun had set. As the group stood around listening to my update, a member acciden- tally touched the button on their flashlight and cast a beam of light at an angle across one of the stones. Perhaps because I have become so attuned to looking at glyphs over the past years, as the light momentarily struck the rock, I saw a petroglyph. I asked that the light be put back on and there was in- deed a glyph worn into the old stone, looking every bit as old as the site itself. I knew that some glyphs had been discovered on the rocks at Stonehenge and asked Stuart Conway, a journalist and photographer from the Glasgow Herald in Scotland, to take a photograph so we could compare it to the record. Immediately on my return to the United States at the end of the summer, I sent the photograph and placement to Professor Gerald Hawkins, author of Stonehenge Decoded , who knows every surface of rock personally, not only through his re- search, but because he has also painted each one. Gerald was adamant that the glyph had never before been published. I have spent many weeks this summer with English Heritage and they also agree that this is a new discovery, probably only seen this time due to the angle of the light that hit it. Will you be surprised to hear that the stone the glyph is carved on is at the same place- ment in the Stonehenge arrangement (210 degrees around the horseshoe from the heel stone) as the second white sphere on my rock? ••• A final word: On the night of July 14, I went with a group of people to Stonehenge to officially declare the find- ing with photographs, measurements, and a ceremony. Later that night my car was broken into and, at some point, the film from my camera was removed. This seemed odd. Since there was plenty of additional photographic evidence of the evening, why remove my film? Since this story was published by CPR International, several sources have claimed that the glyph Colin discovered had been previously reported and noted by English Heritage. No official record has yet been provided to support these claims. This Triple Julia Set formed shortly after the amazing Julia Set near Stonehenge in 1996. Each circle displayed a different swirl detail. The pattern was over 120 meters across. 15 Chap 7.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 93"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact 15 Chap 7.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 94"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"An Interview With Busty Taylor / 95 Chapter 8 An Interview With Busty Taylor 95 B usty Taylor is a pilot who regularly flies his light aircraft over the fields of England looking for new crop circles. In 1985, he discovered a set of five crop circles forming a Celtic Cross south of his home, which started him on the long road of crop circle investigation. Taylor has worked with Pat Delgado, Terence Meaden, Colin Andrews, and others. In the 1980s, he was part of the first research team to undertake investigation of the crop circle mystery. In this interview, Busty shares his thoughts concerning the crop circle enigma. ••• Q In 1985, you saw your first crop circles while flying over a field in your small plane. What were your thoughts when you saw the formation? A I knew that I had seen this before, but could not remember where. A few days later there was a meeting in New Alresford with Pat Delgado, Omar Fowler, Paul Fuller, and Martin Pain, a local farmer, who pointed out that the crop design I had seen and photographed was a Celtic Cross. That was when I remembered where I had seen the symbol before: in the local church- yards on tombstones. Q What was the strongest evidence in those early days that convinced you that these strange patterns in the fields were worth further study? A The plants had no damage that I could see, plus the stalks were bent — not broken — 90 degrees at the base. In black- and-white photos, you could see a distinct contrast difference between the design and the other crops. Also, I could not find any human tracks into the formation from any direction. Q Was there a particular crop forma- tion that convinced you that the trend of hoaxing had begun and that manmade circles would be part of the scene from then on? A In 1987, I flew over the Cheesefoot Head to take some photos of an au- thentic ringed circle, and then I flew back to Thruxton. I subsequently drove back to the field I had just flown over and discov- ered that a small ringed circle had turned up within that last hour. This circle, when viewed from the edge of the field through binoculars, looked very rough compared to the genuine one I had just photographed, 16 Chap 8.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 95"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact and it had irregular edges. I immediately thought it was a fake and, from that point on, it would be important to differenti- ate between the real and the counterfeit formations. Q What have you personally seen that convinces you that a real phenom- enon exists? A Over the last 17 years, I have been lucky enough to get into some crop circles very early after their formation, before they have been contaminated by other people. I have seen formations me- ticulously laid out without any sign of hu- man intervention, and I have seen oil-seed rape stalks with perfect 90-degree bends. One particularly memorable incident occurred at Headbourne Worthy, where we found a counterclockwise circle with a strange weave inside it. As soon as I saw it, I made a comment into the video cam- era, remarking on the complexity of the weave on the ground. It was only later when we saw the crop circle from the air that we noticed that the main lay of the circle itself had a clockwise spiral to it. The swirl of the overall pattern was in one di- rection, but on the ground, the weave was in the opposite, and was an extremely com- plex plait. To my mind, this was very com- pelling evidence of some unknown phenomenon. Q During your research, have you wit- nessed any specific physical or men- tal effects on people that have visited crop circles? A Yes. I have seen people become elated on entering a formation, and I have personally taken a man into the 1989 Win- terbourne Stoke Swastika. He claims that his chronic bad back was healed perma- nently after visiting the crop circle. Accord- ing to this man, after he left the formation and began driving away from the site to- wards London, his back got hotter and hot- ter and then suddenly his back pain stopped for good, and never returned. Interestingly, sometimes the circles seem to stimulate un- commonly authoritative attitudes in people. I have heard people report that a sense of power came over them after they visited a circle, and I have witnessed some people ’ s attitude towards others become very domineering. Q What do you think the crop circle phenomenon is all about? A I think it may be a form of communi- cation, as many of the early circles were representations of Celtic symbols that have been used throughout history. Perhaps these symbols were also found in the crops thousands of years ago. Q In your opinion, what research still needs to be carried out, and how do you think it will advance our knowl- edge and understanding of the crop circle phenomenon? A In a nutshell, I think we all need to work together. Crop circle research- ers should make a concerted effort to de- velop a program of structured research that could then be reviewed and collated. At the moment, people are off doing their own thing, and many are carrying out research which somebody else might also be doing without realizing it. If we could organize, we might move much faster with the re- search and more quickly discover an an- swer to what this is all about. Q Have the crop circle counterfeiters taught us anything? A Yes, they have taught us that man has the ability to replicate what he sees in nature. This might be what happened 16 Chap 8.p65 2/11/03, 4:49 PM 96"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"An Interview With Busty Taylor / 97 thousands of years ago. Man might have duplicated the early crop circle designs and used the patterns in artwork and at ar- chaeological sites. What we now know as a Celtic Cross might very well be a copy of something ancient man saw in the fields. Some circle counterfeiters claim that they have witnessed some strange things dur- ing their circle making; I think we should look more deeply into this. Q Have the crop circles changed your life? A Yes, my life has changed since my first circle. The circles have spurred me to look into the past of all religions and search for an answer and, in doing so, I consider myself a much wiser person for the experience. In 1986, an elderly couple driving over Stockbridge Downs, near Stockbridge, Hampshire, England called police after witnessing a large UFO stand on its end over the downs.

Kimpton is a very small hamlet near Andover, about five miles from my home at the time. It is comprised of no more than two dozen houses in a small rural village near a private landing strip in Hampshire, England. The pilot had seen a crop ring in which the plants were spiraled in a clockwise di- rection, and he thought I would want to know about it. Because I had a great many hours of personal time owed to me, I de- cided to leave work and pay a visit to this formation. When I arrived at the farm, I in- troduced myself to the farmer and together we walked out into the field where the crop ring had appeared. I knew imme diately that Everyone hears only what he understands. — Jonathan Wolfgang von Goethe it was an authentic manifestation and I re- quested, and was granted, permission to return the following day with my col- leagues for further investigation. I assembled a team of scientists, engi- neers and other interested parties — includ- ing Dr. Terence Meaden and Pat Delgado — and we went back to the farmer ’ s field the next day and performed our standard investigative routine. We measured for radiation with a Geiger counter. We took a great many physical measurements, we took soil and plant samples. We used a compass to determine the magnetic orientation and alignment of the plants. Upon conclusion of our research, we all left the field and, because it was near- ing the end of the workday, we returned to our respective homes. Later that day, towards early evening, I was going through my notes at home and 19 Chap 9.p65 2/11/03, 4:50 PM 103"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact I realized that in order to be completely thor- ough, I needed to take a few more mea- surements of the crop circle, some of which I felt could be quite useful. I decided to return to the field. This time, I decided not to bother the farmer after his day of labor. He had, after all, given me permission to enter his land, and I was certain he would not object to a follow-up visit. I drove to Kimpton, and I parked my car on the side of the highway out of the line of traffic. I stepped out of the car and I paused for a moment to look at the setting sun. The smell of growing wheat was car- ried to me on a slight breeze that also bore the gentle smell of heather as it wafted across the fields. I walked slowly towards a small church, and I was quite conscious of how relaxed I was, and I was also aware of how little fear I felt. I was returning to a field where a crop ring had appeared that afternoon, and which I and my colleagues had already measured and photographed. I was back because something had occurred to me when I was at home and I wanted to take another measurement. This seemed to be a very ordinary activity to me. Behind the church was a small grave- yard that dated back at least to the 15 th cen- tury. The tombstones stood silent and gray in the gloaming and I was careful not to trod on the graves as I passed through this city of the dead. Respect. Very important. I reached the back of the cemetery and climbed easily over some low barbed wire, placed there not to keep out humans, but to deter nocturnal marauders, such as foxes and badgers. As I moved across the field, dusk be- came dark. It took me a few minutes to reach the crop ring. As I walked, I distinctly heard a dog barking in the distance. Aside from my far-off canine friend, there was silence in the field. I was quite alone. When I reached the ring, I walked in- side its perimeter and stared at the flattened barley plants swirling in a clockwise di- rection. I took my measurement and then something came over me — an urge, an impulse, a yearning. Call it what you will, but the effect was to prod me to do some- thing I had not planned to do. It was a pure, spontaneous moment, brought on by my fervid desire to understand. I turned west, where Stonehenge stood silent, I put my hands together, and I prayed. I did not speak, but in my mind I sent out the plea, “ Please, God, give me a clue as to what is happening here and help me understand what this is all about. ” At the precise moment that my prayer ended — the exact second — I heard an odd crackling sound from approximately seven or eight feet in front of me that sounded a bit like static, but with a more metallic edge to it. It was an unusual, continuous whir- ring sound at close to ground level and I immediately thought it was being made by some kind of insect. I rejected that straight- away because the sound was too mechani- cal and much too loud for an insect. As I listened, the sound got louder and louder. I flirted with the idea that it was some kind of rodent, or some other animal, but I also discarded that theory since, again, the me- chanical nature of the sound was quite pro- nounced. As the volume of the sound rose, I could feel the air around me begin to move, and I sensed the hairs on my arms standing up and I could feel air pulsating the cheeks of my face. At this point, I became quite concerned and, within a very short time, concern had turned to fear. I thought I recognized the sound from my work as an electrical engi- neer. I had heard similar sounds in labora- tories in situations where there was a buildup of high levels of voltage between an anode and a cathode. Just before there 19 Chap 9.p65 2/11/03, 4:50 PM 104"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Sounds From the Fields / 105 is a discharge of electricity, there is a metallic purring sound, and that was similar to what I heard that night in the field. I say now for the record, and with the utmost sincerity, that the prevailing thought that was running through my mind as I stood there listening to that sound, was that something was going to materialize in front of me, there, in the center of the crop circle. Ulti- mately, nothing appeared, but the sound continued. I am not ashamed to admit that my fear reached a new level at that point and I be- gan to look for the quickest way out of the field. As I prepared to flee, however, the sound suddenly stopped — it was as though a switch had been thrown. And to this day, I believe that the “ switch ” was my fear. As soon as my trepidation and alarm turned to outright terror, the sound stopped. Did the consciousness that was responsible for the crop circle and its attendant sound re- spond to my panic and turn off the sound to reassure and comfort me? It did seem that way to me at the time, and I still be- lieve that there was a deliberate response from the intelligence that made the circle. The circles are a gentle, benign presence on earth. I think the presence of the con- trary emotion of fear caused some kind of reaction and that the purpose of restoring silence was to bring balance to the situa- tion. The positive energies at the site were being torn apart by my dread and nature responded. I quickly left the circle, and it would be another year before I would hear that sound again. ••• I have thought about that first time many times since that night in the field, and the exact moment that my prayer was an- swered. It was a straight line for me: I had prayed for an answer; I received one. It was, perhaps, more than I could emotion- ally handle. I became terribly frightened; the sound of the circle stopped. Was this all just coincidence? Was it coincidental that the moment my emotions changed from relaxed curiosity to abject terror, the thing that was frightening me ceased? Two years later, in July 1989, the BBC recorded the same crop circle sound. It was then that I learned that the sound was a 5.2 kilohertz frequency and I now have this sound on tape and I have played it at many lectures and conventions. A BBC TV cam- era was destroyed during the taping. This event made national headlines in Britain. Is the sound the sound of the crop circles? I believe it is, and it was Operation White Crow that convinced me of its authen- ticity — and its importance. (Please see Chap- ter 15 for more on the sound of the circles.) This formation discovered by Busty Taylor and Colin Andrews during a reconnaissance flight over Clench Common, Wiltshire on the 10th of August, 2000. 19 Chap 9.p65 2/11/03, 4:50 PM 105"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact 19 Chap 9.p65 2/11/03, 4:50 PM 106"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Operation White Crow / 107 Chapter 10 Operation White Crow 107 The Devil’s Punchbowl O peration White Crow was the first crop circle surveillance operation, and it took place in the “ Devil ’ s Punchbowl ” in Cheesefoot Head, Winches- ter, in Hampshire, in 1989, one year prior to Operation Blackbird. Operation White Crow is significant to me for several reasons, the most important being the fact that it was the second time I heard the odd “ crop circle sound ” (see Chapter 9), and also, because of the very strange things that happened to my friend, co-author, and fellow researcher, Pat Delgado. We had a caravan of vehicles, work sta- tions, and cameras. One evening, some of us who were directly participating in the surveillance operation decided to get away from the main base of operations and walk 100 yards or so away from the bustle. We all walked off into a single crop circle, the larger of a formation of two circles that had appeared in the field next to the one we were monitoring. There were seven or eight of us, including psychic Rita If you wish to upset the law that all crows are black, you mustn ’ t seek to show that no crows are; it is enough if you prove one single crow to be white. — William James Gould, and we all sat down and tried to relax. We did not meditate, or attempt to make contact with the intelligence of the circles — this was not a s é ance — but we were all in a relaxed state of mind. Suddenly, we all heard a sound from the east. As we listened, it grew louder and we could sense it getting closer. It was defi- nitely directional, in that we all could tell precisely where it was coming from, and we could follow it as it moved. The sound then rotated around us, floating around the circle three or four times, like an auditory cloud that passed above us in a circle. And again, it was directional: As it moved in its orbit around us, we could follow it with our ears, and if it had been visible, we all felt we would have been able to track it from point to point around the circle. First it was in our left ear, then behind us, then in our right ear. We were all responsible adults with jobs and families, but we were also all open to the idea of alternate realities and to the notion that strange things were possible. Yet, that said, we were all quite frightened 20 Chap 10.p65 2/11/03, 4:50 PM 107"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact and we huddled together like a bunch of schoolboys. It truly was a scary moment. We were in a pitch black field and we had no idea what this sound was or where it was coming from. And then the sound stopped moving. We could all still hear it, but it froze and positioned itself in front Pat Delgado and I. At this time, Pat was very involved in researching and trying to understand the phenomenon, as was I. Could the source of the sound somehow sensed this? We did not know what to expect next, and as we waited for something to happen, suddenly Pat Delgado stood up and began to walk towards the place in the circle from where the sound was now emanating. He walked to the edge of the circle, and he later told me that he knew that the sound was no more than three or four feet in front of him. This was somewhat closer than the sound was to me when I heard it at Kimpton. And then it got really weird. As Pat stood there at the edge of the circle, he called out: “ Colin, come to me, ” he said. And then, he cupped his left hand and began to “ scoop ” in the air at the top of the plants closest to the sound and push this energy in my direction. I walked towards him, and when I reached him, he continued his odd cupping and scooping motion across the top of the plants, pushing the air towards me, specifi- cally towards my solar plexus — he aimed it straight at the pit of my stomach. I stood there and went along with this, not know- ing how to respond, or what to say. After a bit, Pat stopped and I backed away. I turned around, walked back to the group, and sat down. I was confused and frightened and knew that something strange was occur- ring. Pat then started to walk toward us. When he reached a point about 25 to 30 feet away from us, he stopped in his tracks, and his head went back as though he were about to fall backwards. It was a most extraordinary sight and I truly did not understand what was going on. As I stared at this incredible sight, he then beckoned to me. Incredibly, his body then leaned back on a 10- to 15-degree angle. He hung there suspended, as though he were leaning against a cushion, or perhaps something more solid. At this point, Pat was absolutely terri- fied. I could see fear in his eyes and he started shouting to me. “ Colin! Come and hold me up! ” I rushed to him and grabbed both his hands and tried to pull him to an upright position. I felt great pressure pull- ing against me, and it was as though Pat was stuck to glue. I continued to tug at him, and then suddenly he was free. It felt as though a bond had snapped and his body was released from the force that had been holding him. At the precise moment that Pat was pulled free, the crop circle sound stopped. This was, quite literally, one of the worst things that had ever happened to me or Pat. Upset and shaken, we returned to the group and sat down, but after only a few moments, Pat said, “ Let ’ s get the hell out of here, ” and we all left the circle. The following morning, as we were working in the base camp of the operation, a police sergeant drove up. We had obtained all necessary permissions to conduct the operation, so the police knew we were there, and they knew what we were doing. “ Are you aware, ” the sergeant asked us, pointing off in the direction of the sound from the night before, “ that there ’ s a circle with a ring on the top of the hill over there? ” We replied that we were not aware of any new formation and the sergeant offered to drive us there in the police car. 20 Chap 10.p65 2/11/03, 4:50 PM 108"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Operation White Crow / 109 We gratefully accepted and we sped off towards the hill he had pointed out. When we arrived, we were flabber- gasted. In the exact direction the sound seemed to travel to when it left us was a fresh crop ring. The plants were still pop- ping up, and still moving, as though a pow- erful hand had pressed them down, and they were just now springing back up. I believed then, as I believe now, that the previous night we had inadvertently encroached upon the creation of a crop circle. We had all unwittingly placed our- selves in the middle of a paranormal event. At one point Rita Gould did attempt to make contact with the force behind the sound that we were all hearing, but we do not know for certain that her efforts made any difference.

Once, during a lecture in San Francisco, I spoke of the importance of remote viewing in explor- ing human potentials. Afterwards, I was ap- proached by a very indignant man who warned me from getting involved in such a A reasonable being should ask himself why — if chemicals can enter into plants, and plants be taken up into animals, and animals be taken into man — why man himself, who is the peak of visible creation, should be denied the privilege of being assimilated into a higher power? The rose has no right to say that there is no life above it and neither has man, who has a vast capacity and unconquerable yearning for eternal life and truth and love. — Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen load of rubbish. I disagreed and we left it at that. In fact, I have had many events in my life surrounding the crop circles that strongly led me into the study of remote viewing. Remote viewing is the ability to men- tally receive visual and auditory informa- tion without being limited by distance or time. Public research into this area began in the early 1970s, with much of it being carried out at Stanford Research Institute at Palo Alto, California. In 1977, physi- cists Russell Targ and Harold Putoff pub- lished their research ( Mind Reach ) in which they described remote viewing as “ the ability...to view, by means of mental process, remote geographical or technical targets.... ” In another book written by Russell Targ, with Keith Harary ( Mind Race , 21 Chap 11.p65 2/11/03, 4:51 PM 111"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"112 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact 1984), the authors quoted from a congres- sional committee on science and technol- ogy, U.S. House of Representatives, 97th Congress, June 1981: Recent experiments in remote viewing and other studies in parapsy- chology suggest there is an interconnectedness of the human mind with other human minds and matter...The implications of these ex- periments is that the human mind may be able to obtain information inde- pendent of geography and time. This is no surprise to those who are familiar with Rupert Sheldrake and his theories of morphic fields and resonance ( The New Science of Life and In the Presence of the Past ). Also along this line is the idea of a “ holographic universe ” where the universe is seen as an indivis- ible whole and every piece of the whole has intrinsically within itself access to the whole, much like every cell in our body contains the DNA that has the blueprint of the entire body (Michael Talbot, 1991). Both of these theories are simply new at- tempts to create a construct within which supernormal events can be explained, as Carl Jung did with his theory of the col- lective unconscious. In any event, there is strong theoretical support for the process of remote viewing, even stronger experi- mental support and, to top it off, great gov- ernmental interest in this means of obtaining information. Remote viewing impacts the subject of crop circles in two ways. First, remote viewing can be, and has been used to, ob- tain information regarding the construction and shape of crop circles. Second, theo- retically, the process of remote viewing is reversible. What I mean by that is that if we can use our minds to see things from a distance, we can also use our minds to project things. Additionally, can images be “ remote viewed ” into our minds from other sources? Accuracy in remote viewing is attained through rigorous training and practice. A beginning remote viewer is considered to have a “ hit, ” or to have succeeded, if com- ponents of the target are seen. They often will not be seen in mirror image to the ac- tual item. For example, Synthia once gave me a target of an overhead fan. What I saw was a propeller with a cone on it. Al- though not exact, the components were there and, in this case, they were in the correct placement. I was not, however, able to identify what the object was. It is very interesting that the act of remote viewing can influence the place and people being perceived. This is the case of many people who have had expe- riences of projecting a mental image of a pattern and then having it appear in the fields. The Celtic Cross of Longstock (1988) was one such incident when I pro- jected the Celtic Cross and asked for it be placed in the field closest to my home. The next day it was there as projected and requested (T8). Another such event occurred in 1992 when Dr. Steven Greer and a group of 18 individuals all agreed on a pattern that they also projected from their minds. Again, it appeared in the fields the next day. In both cases, we projected a meaningful symbol, and it appeared, as if by an interactive force. On the 18th of June this year (1997), when I arrived at my parents ’ house in Andover, in the United Kingdom, to start the summer ’ s research, I noticed a beauti- ful plate next to my parents ’ fireplace. The dish had a powerful symbol in the center of it. When I asked my parents where they got the dish, my mother replied that my niece Hayley had made it for her. I was very impressed with the professional look of it, especially for a 13-year-old. But what was more impressive was the impact of the 21 Chap 11.p65 2/11/03, 4:51 PM 112"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Hayley’s Connection / 113 symbol. I made a mental note to ask Hayley where she obtained the symbol. On the morning of the 19th of June, in the adjacent field at Longstock where the Celtic Cross had appeared in 1988, the farmer discovered an impressive new crop pattern (T489). He was sure that the pat- tern was not there the day before as the area was under surveillance by a group of bird watchers and the police during the time of its arrival and for four weeks prior. The interest in the area was due to a very rare and endangered bird that had been nesting nearby. I can vouch for the security myself. Within moments of parking my car in the road next to the field, I was approached by the police and I could see watchers with binoculars perched in nearby trees. They had seen nothing in the fields for the four weeks they had been bird-watching. This morning, however, there was a majestic and undam- aged crop design, with no tracks in or out. I flew over the formation later that morn- ing and immediately noticed the simi larity between this pattern and the symbol on Hayley ’ s dish. I talked to Hayley later that week and asked where she got the symbol. She told me the symbol came into her mind on the 31st of January and she decided to draw it.

She said she drew it that way because that was the way she saw it. However, when she decided to draw the symbol onto the plate for her Granny, she decided to alter the design, evolving it to contain most of the major components and placements of the forma- tion which appeared on the 19th of June, which was formation T489. The story does not end here. On the 10th of July I met with a group from America who had come over with re- searcher/artist Ron Russell.

It was the same design, only she had placed loops where Hayley had placed inverted Vs. Later, a fresh design appeared which was an even better fit. So, were the circles the result of my niece imaging a pattern which was then, through an interactive force, projected into the field? Or did my niece and the Ameri- can woman remote view a future event? Or perhaps, another possibility: Were the patterns projected into Hayley ’ s and the woman ’ s mind by an interactive force in- volved in the circle ’ s creation? Is it the same interactive force that responded to my projection in 1988 and Steven Greer ’ s in 1992?

Perhaps it is time we respond and join those using their thoughts to create a better world. It is possible our best hope for the fu- ture lies in our highest ability to imagine.

Although it is somewhat technical in nature, we decided to include it here be- cause of the enormous interest in crop circles by a great many scientists, math- ematicians, musicologists, and science- minded lay people. This article was taken from the Circles Phenomenon Research International Newsletter , Volume 5, No.2, Fall/Winter 1996/97. ••• Circular Evidence by Colin Andrews and Pat Delgado provides the only set of accurately measured circle diameters avail- able for rigorous analysis for the early pe- riod of the phenomenon, frozen in time, and unbiased by the flood of later activity. Those measured patterns reveal a tell-tale set of numbers: the fractions of the major scale of Western music. Starting with the tonic, C, each white note on the piano increases in pitch as follows: CDE F G A B C ’ 1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2 The same ratios occur above middle C, but double with each octave. For ex- ample, 6:2 gives G ’ , 16:3 gives F ” , where each mark ’ after a note is used to indicate a rise of one octave. There are the perfect diatonic ratios. In well-tempered or equal temperament tuning, the ratio, r, is more complicated: r = 2 n/12 (raised to the power of n/12) where “ n ” is taken as a number ranging between 0 and 12. The diatonic fractions fall out, or occur, when n is 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 12. I took all the circles where measure- ments are given in Circular Evidence .

The measurements at the outside edge of each ring was taken. Taking intervals of + /- 0.165 as n, 16 of the ratios fell on diatonics as shown in the figure to the right. Each and every white note was hit, and the black notes were not. The statistical probability that this is random is negli- gible. Noting that in Fig- ure 1 the tonic appears twice (C, C ’ ), there are seven independent tar- gets set in a spread of 35 spaces, making the chance of a single random hit 0.2. The probability that 16 hits or more from 25 shots is real, by the bi- nomial theorem, has a confidence level greater than 99.99 percent. The Sussex group measured seven formations between 1993 and 1995, and four were diatonic, adding confirmation to the Circular Evidence re- sults. This was repeated for the inside edges of the rings, and no significant correlation with the diatonic ratios was found. Of course we cannot say that the crop circles are “ musical. ” All that can be said is that the crop circles and the eight-note musical scale are based on the same math- ematical relationship. There are two internal checks we can apply. Firstly, we can look at the error dis- tribution. The standard deviation was + /- 0.23, corresponding to + /- 20 centimeters in a 20 meter circle. The deviations were symmetrical about zero, and showed a tol- erable fit to a normal error curve. This con- firms that the musical ratios were indeed aimed at, and that the circles were con- structed with a tolerance of + /- 1 percent. Secondly, we can arbitrarily reverse the rules, applying the linear rule to concen- tric circles, and the square rule to satellites. When this is done, the diatonic ratios dis- appear statistically. This simple check shows that musical ratios do not easily oc- cur in patterns regardless of assumptions. There is a slight tendency for the measured diameters to cluster at unit val- ues of meters and this raises the ques- tion, “ Could the hoaxers strike off the ratios 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, and so forth, at ran- dom by using a bar of fixed length? ” The answer is no. Taking all fractions made from the numbers between one and 16, the non-diatonic ratio 7/4 should occur by chance, but it is avoided in all the data. Yet the diatonic 15/8 was found in the circles, even though it should occur less often than 7/4 by chance. Then again, we would expect the black note ratios, such as 16/9, but none of these black notes were hit.

He, in 1596, theorized how the solar system orbits were pure geom- etry, but the measurements of Tycho Brahe proved him wrong. Equally unfortunate, his theory of a universe controlled by musical intervals was destroyed by the facts. With the crop circles, however, the music is not a theory, it is a fact.

A detailed study of crop circle coun- terfeiters has not yet been done and I think it is imperative that such a study be under- taken.

Admittedly, the efforts of counterfeit- ers have become more sophisticated and complex over the past several years, seem- ing to parallel the sophistication — the evo- lution — of the authentic formations. Yet, it is known that counterfeiters have de- liberately laid claim to highly complex au- thentic formations that they had absolutely nothing to do with. Why would they do such a thing? What could be the reason- ing behind claiming responsibility for in- credible manifestations in fields around the world, knowing full well they would never be able to duplicate the design if put to the test? A detailed, comprehensive study of the hoaxing subculture needs to be done. Hoax- ing muddies the waters and confuses the public, a populace that may not have much of a grounding, a knowledge base, of this extraordinary miracle taking place on our planet. The crop circle mystery is perplex- ing enough in and of itself without having these “ fibbing bounders ” (as researcher Danny Sotham has christened them) tramp- ing all over the place, giddily delighting in tricking people into believing what, in es- sence, is nothing but a lie. There has long been suspicion that there is much more to the hoaxing move- ment than may at first be presumed. Is it possible that the intelligence communities (CIA or M15, for example) in the coun- tries where the phenomena is prevalent have recruited young to middle-aged males to vigorously and repeatedly create fakes? Would they lay claim to real formations, in a concerted attempt to trivialize, mini- mize, and ultimately discredit all that is genuine? Disinformation has long been a hoary tactic in the intelligence communities ’ bag of duplicitous tricks. If, for some reason, world governments and their respective intelligence communities wanted to get the public “ off the scent, ” there might be no better way then to put forth the message that all crop formations are fakes. I have stated that I do not believe that government satellites are responsible for crop circles. However, it is not beyond the realm of pos- sibility that governments may be attempt- ing to completely debunk the phenomena using a trained (and, it must be assumed, paid) team of hoaxers. War of the Worlds Why would this be deemed necessary? Some blame Orson Welles ’ The War of the Worlds. It has long been suspected that world governments are fully apprised of the real- ity of UFOs and aliens, but that this infor- mation has been deliberately kept from the public because of the War of the Worlds debacle in 1938. On Sunday, October 30, 1938, the day before Halloween, Orson Welles drama- tized H. G. Wells ’ s classic science fiction novel War of the Worlds for his Mercury Theater radio troupe. Welles ’ s broadcast terrified millions of people and caused a national panic. A Princeton University study later determined that a total of 6 mil- lion people heard Welles ’ s broadcast. Of those listeners, 1.7 million believed it was a real news bulletin and 1.2 million actu- ally took action because of it . The New York City police department received 2,000 hysterical emergency calls from people during the first 15 minutes of the broadcast.

We know that complex designs can be made by people. However, there are com- plex designs out there that show no evi- dence of the human hand whatsoever, and yet some of these are also claimed to be made by people. The enigma of the mys- tery is compounded by the question of why do hoaxers do what they do, and claim to have done things that show no sign of hu- man involvement. I think for the most part, that the manner in which many of the crop circle counterfeiters have conducted them- selves is disgraceful. Counterfeiters fall into two different camps. One group of hoaxers want their artwork to remain mysterious. They claim to be making crop art, but they refuse to identify which specific “ works ” they are responsible for. They are passionate about maintaining the mystery and anonymity of their formations. They define what they do as experiential art, and they consider them- selves invisible observers of the people who experience their art. Supposedly, the act of observing the effects that their art- work has on people is part of the overall artistic experience. This explains their in- sistence on mystery and anonymity This appears to be aesthetically noble, and completely respectful of the undeni- able beauty and impact crop formations have on people. However, it also serves to make their claims unprovable and it casts doubt on their ceaseless proclamations that they are responsible for this circle, or for that formation. Sophisticated research and A Doug and Dave creation, this one in Chilcomb Down, made in 1991. Looking at these formations, it is easy to conclude that Doug and Dave’s crop circle skills did not extend to the more complex patterns they took credit for when they went public with their story. 25 Chap 13.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 125"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact equipment and advanced investigative in- telligence techniques would be necessary to disprove all their claims and, even more importantly, prove their claims, and who would be willing to pay for that? On sev- eral occasions during 1999 and 2000, spe- cial night vision equipment did observe people making some elaborate patterns, but the large scale claims thus far remain unchallenged. The second group consists of counter- feiters who have realized that continually hoaxing researchers and the public has be- come a potentially dangerous game, and that there is an inherent responsibility that comes with such deceptive practices. These are the folks who are more prone to be- lieving that there is an actual phenomena at work out there, and that it is the right thing to do to step forward and admit the ones they ’ ve made, and then work with researchers openly. They are the ones who are willing to explain what they do, how they do it, and where they ’ ve done it. I have been in touch with some of these people and many of them understand that there are consequences attached to their actions. Researchers need to know what is real and what is not, because people, gov- ernmental agencies, and the media act on such research. Many of these counterfeit- ers know that I and others provide aerial photographs of crop formations to govern- ments, to civic officials, to the British Royal family, to native Americans and other indigenous peoples, and many oth- ers, all of whom are extremely interested in the crop circle phenomenon that is tak- ing place on our planet. (Native Americans in particular are extremely interested in authentic crop circle manifestations, be- cause they believe that these creations may be connected in some way to ancient tribal Hopi prophecy.) Providing information to these people is an enormous responsibility, and some of the hoaxers now recognize the gravity of their “ pranks. ” And I am just one re- searcher. All over the world, serious crop circle researchers are providing informa- tion of this type to people, governments, and agencies who need to know, and, I ’ ll state it once again emphatically, hoaxes muddy the waters. If, as I sincerely believe, the authentic crop circle formations are a sign from a higher intelligence, and there is a very se- rious message being communicated to us, it is a grave error in judgement for hoaxers to take this lightly, to mock the serious stu- dents of the phenomena, and to deliberately work to deceive. There has been a para- digm shift in consciousness on a global scale regarding the environment over the past several decades and the benign glory of real crop formations has spoken at a pri- mal level to people who know they should be worried about the planet ’ s health. One of the most fundamental facts about the crop circle phenomenon is that the plants in crop circles do not die . They are not killed. They continue to grow, and they grow with greater vigor. The plants in hoaxed circles are badly damaged and, in many cases, are killed. They are crushed to death or broken down. Hoaxers vex me. They play a game that mocks the work of serious researchers try- ing to understand a phenomena that could have monumental importance for the fate of the planet and all living things aboard her. The irony in all this is that many coun- terfeiters themselves — and I have been told this personally — have often come upon the same unusual, paranormal anomalies in crop circles that we have experienced, noted, and recorded. As they go on with their daft business of stomping about with boards and ropes, they have heard the sounds, seen the lights, and felt the energy waves. It seems as though they have some- how become unwitting participants in the 25 Chap 13.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 126"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Crop Circle Hoaxes and the Circus in the Fields / 127 gest. Is it possible that by focusing intently on the sacred geometries they use to create a fake crop formation, hoaxers are some- how tapping into a different sensibility, into the higher consciousness many experience when in contact with authentic crop circles? Can the deliberate creation of a fake crop formation — the actual act itself of design- ing it and making it — be a catalyst for an interaction between the hoaxers and the intelligence behind the true mystery? Sacred geometry has been used for millennium as a tool for meditation, and as a gateway to achieving a higher state of consciousness. Hoaxers may be closer to the actual phenomenon than they may suspect. I have used the term “ friendly animos- ity ” to describe my relationship with many of the admitted circle makers, but my (mostly) cordial interaction with them has an edge. And in all honesty, the essence of this edge is that I wish they did not exist. I am not wishing that the individuals who comprise the circle makers did not exist. Far from it. Heaven knows I would never wish them harm. I simply wish that all the circle makers who devote their time, their energy, and their resources to deceiving the world would find better ways to spend their time. Granted, the making of art is often an act of creativity and enlightenment, an in- herently positive endeavor: The artist pro- duces a work to mirror a specific circumstance of the human condition. But counterfeiters pervert and debase the ar- tistic process. If a painter creates a stun- ningly beautiful painting — a work that happens to be an identical copy of a Van Gogh, or a Rembrandt, or a Klimt — and then sells it as an original, is this an “ in- herently positive endeavor ” ? I think not. And many agree with me. All that said, though, to reiterate, the circle makers do have a story to tell. Their presence in the fields, and their participa- tion in the phenomena — no matter how tan- gential or skewed — may ultimately become a study in consciousness. I believe it would do grave harm to allow anger towards the hoaxers to consume those of us who be- lieve that these people are tampering with what might be called a miracle. Consider this: Imagine if hoaxers sim- ply stopped. One day, they threw away their boards, coiled up their ropes, and simply went away. With confidence and certainty, I will state that, if that happened, crop for- mations would continue to appear, and ev- ery one of them would be a source of wonder. Imagine the state of the research then! Imagine the progress we would make if all we needed to investigate were real crop circles, each one a unique treasure of the fields! But that is not going to happen, unless all the counterfeiters jointly agree to cease and desist their duplicitous efforts. Because that is unlikely, researchers must factor them into the equation. Thus, we try to dis- cern the fakes from the real ones; we inter- view hoaxers about their experiences in the fields; and we spend countless hours and untold energy explaining to people inter- ested in crop circles why they should not assume that every crop formation is a fake, simply because some of them are. My close friend and my co-author of Circular Evidence , Pat Delgado, a man of good heart and intent, was personally dev- astated by the antics of the crop fakers. The uproar in the media over Doug and Dave, as well as the mindless acceptance of any- thing claimed by those copycats who fol- lowed, caused Pat tremendous grief. When he and I first began investigating the earli- est crop circles, we both believed we were working for the good of humanity; that we were trying to help understand something that could be quite extraordinary in the his- tory of man and his interaction with the 25 Chap 13.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 127"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact planet. When Doug and Dave came for- ward and claimed authorship of a ridicu- lous number of crop circles (a number so high, in fact, it would have been physically impossible for them to have made them all), we students of the phenomenon were stand- ing in the line of fire; we were suddenly targets for a media not interested in the truth, but only in how much mortification they could rain down upon me and Pat. Can the mysterious, unknown forces behind authentic crop circles also be ma- nipulating the counterfeiters? Many counterfeiters, sometimes un- knowingly, have duplicated in their manmade creations the same ratios and geometries often found in the real circles. And there are stories told of hoaxers re- turning to the site and finding additions to the formations that they did not create — and many of the add-ons resulted in their original work now complying with the sa- cred geometry ratios often found in real formations. What seems clear to me from all this is the feeling that we must look at the com- plete picture that is developing; we must try to encompass the entirety of the phe- nomenon before passing final judgment. I do not understand hoaxing as a pur- suit worthy of good men, but we do need to continue to talk to these deceivers and put all our efforts into figuring out why they really do what they do. That is the key to understanding how the hoaxers ’ involve- ment in crop circles could be significant. What if we learn that the reason many of the hoaxers take the time to create fake crop circles is because of a subconscious “ call- ing, ” for want of a better term? As we have repeatedly seen, many hoaxers work with the same geometries as are found in au- thentic circles. They also lay them in areas where other circles have been found, and sometimes, in alignment with the earth ’ s ley lines. In fact, there have been occa- sions when two groups of hoaxers, work- ing independently and unbeknownst to each other, have ended up in adjacent fields, cre- ating similar designs. Is this mere coincidence? Or is there some force tugging them in the direction of constructing symbolically significant formations? Is it possible that they are all unconsciously receiving their “ instruc- tions ” from the same force? Are the pat- terns made by hoaxers part of the overall message? These are the questions that need to be researched and answered before we decide on how to respond to what I truly believe is some kind of dispatch from a communi- cator we have yet to meet. The patterns have been evolving in complexity. Using an alphabetical simile, if the first simple circles were the letter A, and the ultimate, final, still unseen crop formation is the letter Z, I believe that we are currently somewhere around the letters V or W. Each year, we believe that forma- tions cannot get much more complex, and then the following year, the formations that appear outdo the previous ones. Hidden somewhere in the fractals, and the ratios, and the geometries, is usable in- formation. I believe that the totality of crop formations is a repository of useful information. I think part of this arcane message lies in the alignment of crop circles around the globe. It has something to do with magnetism, of this I am certain. I also think there may be other “ brothers ” (or perhaps, cousins?) of magnetism that will likewise play a role in our understand- ing of the ultimate message Ohm ’ s Law tells us that there are three components to electrical current. Put sim- ply, voltage equals current times resistance. Magnetic fields are created solely by mov- ing electrical charges and, because it is my 25 Chap 13.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 128"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Crop Circle Hoaxes and the Circus in the Fields / 129 contention that the crop circle mystery in a large part involves magnetism in some form, I consider it a possibility that we may not yet understand all the ramifications of the interaction between electricity and mag- netism. There may still be yet unknown fields of energy created (or possibly de- stroyed) when magnetic fields are gener- ated. What happens to the laws of physics when we exceed the speed of light, for in- stance? I think that when we finally dis- cover all the ramifications to the current scientific laws, we will find many brothers and cousins we did not know existed. Some researchers have suggested that the patterns need to be placed in a particu- lar alignment and that when they are, some- thing wondrous will happen. Human consciousness, this theory posits, is work- ing on fine-tuning this alignment, and that some of the counterfeiters — the ones who truly feel a psychic or spiritual need to make crop circles — may be contributing to the final grid of designs. This theory attempts to factor in the creations of the hoaxers as part of the over- all master plan. I accept this as another hypothesis and will consider the evidence when presented with it, but for me, the most important research would take place if all the fake formations were removed from the equation and we were able to study only the authentic manifestations. We seem to be drifting away from this scenario. (See Chapter 6, “ The Stonehenge Julia Set, ” for more on this critical alignment theory.)

Blackbird fly...into the light of a dark black night... — Paul McCartney However, there is much more to this story than the embarrassment of one Brit. ••• The operation was funded 90 percent by Nippon Television of Japan, with the remaining 10 percent funded by BBC Tele- vision of Great Britain. The plan was to set up a bank of spe- cialized cameras in a place where many crop circles had appeared over the years in the hope that we would actually catch a crop circle forming on film. The location chosen was Bratton Castle, which is an Iron Age hill fort from around the eighth century B . C . on top of highland looking down into the county of Wiltshire, England. It is a gorgeous loca- tion, and the land is owned by the Minis- try of Defense in Great Britain. We requested, and were granted, permission to conduct the operation. Later we would realize the permission came a bit too readily, but at the time, we were delighted at the willingness with which the Ministry of Defense ’ s office granted us permission. 26 Chap 14.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 131"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"132 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Within a few hours after the operation began, Pat Delgado and I were approached by BBC Television personnel, a representa- tive from Nippon TV, and two uniformed military officers from the British Army. The operation had already begun to attract attention from the locals, and for good reason. A command and control cen- ter had been set up above the field, and there were cameras, wires, antennae, tents, vehicles, and many personnel milling about. The TV representatives and the mili- tary officers suggested that we drive off the site in my motorcar to discuss something of importance, and Pat and I readily agreed. We traveled a short distance to a coun- try lane where we were out of sight of the public and away from the commotion of the site. The two military officers then told us that they thought we could use some addi- tional equipment and that they were pre- pared to provide for our use night-viewing, image-intensifying cameras. The specific equipment they offered to us were back- mounted cameras that would be worn in carrying packs on the back and shoulders of the military personnel who would be given the assignment to work with us. We were told that these recording de- vices were state-of-the-art and highly effi- cient, that they would allow us to see a blade of grass from some distance away, at night. Pat and I, as well as the representatives from the Nippon TV and the BBC, were delighted with the opportunity to use ad- vanced military surveillance equipment for Operation Blackbird, and we all felt that the addition of such gear would guarantee that if a crop circle appeared, we would see it, and we would record it. The only condition attached to our use of the military cameras was that two Brit- ish Army officers needed to be assigned to our organizational unit and that they would be the ones to operate the equipment. This made sense, as none of us were trained in The scene during Operation Blackbird. 26 Chap 14.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 132"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Operation Blackbird / 133 the use of such high-tech cameras. We would also be liable for damage to the equipment if something went wrong. And so, we accepted two military of- ficers and their equipment into the opera- tion and onto the site. At the time, we thought nothing of this condition. How- ever, our views on this were to change radi- cally within a very short time. Blackbird became operational, and close to $2-million worth of equipment was online and prepared to chronicle whatever might happen. The equipment had all been checked and every camera was function- ing perfectly when the operation began. The plan was to maintain daylight monitoring, and to also keep a crew work- ing throughout the night. If something should occur during the night, I and a num- ber of other people would be awakened at home. On the second night of the operation, I was at my home in the adjacent county of Hampshire when the phone rang quite late. I was told that something had happened. I was told that an arrangement of crop circles — a fairly complex design — had ap- peared in the field during the night. I immediately notified my contact person from Nippon TV, and we mobi- lized a television crew that had been on standby for just such an eventuality. Be- cause Nippon TV had funded the over- whelming majority of the costs of the operation, they were entitled to the first notification and the first footage of the event. Nippon TV had agreed to partici- pate in Operation Blackbird with the hope that they would record the actual formation of a crop circle and be able to show it on Japanese television. The TV crew sprang into action, and we all sped to the site, not knowing what we would find when we arrived. When we arrived, there was great ex- citement. I was told by personnel there that an event had occurred, and that there was something in the field. I was also told that aerial phenomenon — unusual lights di- rectly over the field — had also been wit- nessed, and that all of this had been captured on camera. Operation Blackbird had begun on July 23, 1990, and here it was two days later, on July 25, and a crop formation had appeared! The formation had first been seen be- tween 3:30 and 3:45 in the morning, not even first light, and it was then that every- one knew that something important had occurred. After the sun rose and we all saw from a distance what was in the field, I was asked if I would announce the event on live tele- vision, which I agreed to do. We had re- quested helicopters for an accurate aerial view of the formation, but they had not yet arrived. I agreed to announce the discov- ery even before I had had a chance to enter the site. The BBC and Nippon TV both had crews there, and they set up the cameras and waited for the proper alignment of their communications satellites for a worldwide broadcast. Lights, camera, action, as they say, and here is what I said that day: Yes, we have an event here of greatest importance...and we are very much excited, as you can imagine. We do have two major ground markings which have appeared in front of all the surveillance equipment, perform- ing absolutely to form for us. We had a situation at approximately 3:30 A . M . this morning. On the monitor, a num- ber of orange lights taking the form of a triangle....It is a complex situ- ation and we are analyzing it at the moment, but there is undoubtedly something here for science. 26 Chap 14.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 133"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"134 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact A reporter then said to me, “ I ’ m sure you have the nation agog. Are you quite sure you couldn ’ t have been the victim of some elaborate hoax last night? ” To which I replied: No, not indeed. We have high- quality equipment here, and we have indeed secured on high-quality equip- ment a major event....We do have something here of great, great signifi- cance. Yes, we have everything on film, and we do have, as I say, a formed object over the field....We are doing nothing more until we have he- licopters over the top, to film in de- tail what we have, before anyone enters the field. What I said was in response to what I had seen from a distance and to what I had been told. My words are now recorded for- ever in the annals of crop circle history, and I can only say that it was a regrettable milestone in my research career. Aside from my obvious error in stat- ing unequivocally that this was an authen- tic event, the essence of my answer, however, still stands as valid and reason- able: We have something here and we are going to investigate it further. I did believe it was an exciting day for science and, in the end, it turned out to be much more than that. A crop formation now existed in the field, unusual lights had been wit- nessed, and we were continuing to ana- lyze the information. The lights turned out to be of the most pedestrian nature: British millionaire Ri- chard Branson had flown a hot air balloon over the field during the night and his run- ning lights were interpreted as being some- thing out of the ordinary. One needed to ask, was Branson a part of the hoax? Was Branson asked or paid to fly a silent “ air- craft ” in pitch darkness over a field where surveillance equipment had been set up on the particular evening when his flight would be noticed? Branson stated emphatically that his was nothing but a curiosity trip and that he had not intended to disrupt an op- eration, nor annoy the crop circle research- ers. So be it. When the sun finally rose on that ill- fated day, we could see clearly what we had in the field. The helicopter had arrived and had begun flying photographers and cameramen over the site for aerial photo- graphs. I and some of my colleagues en- tered the field to investigate the crop formation. My television interview had been broadcast, and there was high expec- tation around the world as to what we would actually find in the fields. What we discovered was a disgrace to the British government, and to everyone else involved in the perpetration of one of the biggest deceits in crop circle history. Oh yes, there was a crop formation in the field beneath Bratton Castle, but it was not only obviously manmade, but it was quite obviously poorly manmade. We had been set up. The crop circle that had been con- structed was ragged, and unlike anything we had seen before. There was consider- able damage to the crops, noticeable irregu- larities in the lines and circles, and, gilding the lily in a way only a bureaucracy could conceive of doing, there were items delib- erately placed in the middle of the main circle, including a horoscope game board, and a wooden cross. It appears that the British government, in an outrageous attempt to defuse the crop circle mania and discredit and humiliate myself and my colleagues, had funded a crop circle hoax. Apparently, the money could not have been put to better use in England, a country where the “ 4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire ” that John Lennon sang about in “ A Day in the Life ” referred to potholes in the streets. 26 Chap 14.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 134"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Operation Blackbird / 135 Pat and I were made to be laughing- stocks. Most of the reporters left, and many ended up writing stories in which we were the fools. We truly felt that serious study of the crop circle phenomenon had been impeded considerably, if not damaged ir- reparably. This was a major setback and the media dropped it like a hot potato. We later learned the specifics of the hoax from a high contact in the British military. Researcher George Wingfield, speaking in Michael Hesemann ’ s book The Cosmic Connection , relayed the following information he received from his anony- mous military contact: The Bratton hoax was carried out by a specially-trained unit of the army and the order came directly from the Ministry of Defense. The operation was carefully planned, prepared in advance and then carried out in com- plete darkness, quickly and precisely. My informant was even able to speak with an officer who was involved in the planning of the operation, which had the highest secrecy level. 1 This could have been the end of Op- eration Blackbird, but it was not. I contin- ued my monitoring of the field, although with far fewer media folk than before the hoax. Ten days after the fake formation had been constructed, a real crop circle ap- peared in the field below Bratton Castle. On August 5, 1990, 440 yards from the site of the hoaxed formation, a real circle appeared — and its formation was captured on film. This second event, which was most definitely an authentic crop formation, was recorded on what has come to be known as the “ yellow camera. ” I was off the site when this occurred, but I was immediately notified of the event and returned within one hour. “ Where ’ s the tape? ” I asked the mo- ment I arrived. I was told by one of the team members that the tape had been placed in a locked box — I was actually shown a sealed case that was supposedly the box where the tape was secured — and I was also informed that it had only been viewed once. I was not allowed to watch the tape nor was I able in any way to confirm that the actual tape from the yellow camera was now in the locked box. I later learned the truth. The tape from the yellow camera had been immediately removed from the site by person or per- sons unknown, and it has never been seen since. I was immediately sworn to secrecy and I was instructed —“ ordered ” is actu- ally a better word — by a person whom I will not name, to give Mr. Michihito Ogawa of Nippon Television a videotape. I was to tell him that the tape was from the yellow camera, and assure him that it con- tained the footage of the crop circle event. The tape given to Mr. Ogawa was actually video of the site taken days earlier, and it showed nothing but the silent landscape. Mr. Ogowa returned to NTV headquar- ters in Japan, where extensive analysis of the tape was performed. Regrettably, they were analyzing a decoy tape. The tape that they owned the rights to was not provided to them, and to this day I have no knowl- edge of the whereabouts of the tape from the yellow camera — footage that shows the formation of an authentic crop circle in a field in central southern England. I say now that I firmly believe that I was not being given a choice when I was told to give NTV a dummy tape. I do not know what would have happened if I had refused to do as I was ordered. I suspect that I would have been banned from the site and that Mr. Ogawa would have been given the phony tape anyway. I was in a very difficult position, seeing as how the 26 Chap 14.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 135"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"136 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact British military — with all the power of the government behind them — was issuing the orders at the Operation Blackbird site. Some years later, a gentleman I know from BBC radio told me that his station was receiving live broadcasts from the Operation Blackbird site, and that after the second event occurred, a rarely issued D Notice was placed on their broadcasts by the British Government. A D Notice is a Ministry of Defense National Security Notice that gives the British Government the right to immediately terminate a radio or television broadcast, ostensibly for rea- sons of national security. That day, the D Notice was invoked, and broadcasts from Operation Blackbird were suspended for a period of four hours. And so, I say again: Operation Black- bird was an important event in crop circle history. It was the first known government attempt to deescalate the public interest in a growing phenomenon, and it was carried out by means of a well-orchestrated, well- funded, multilevel hoax. This speaks volumes about the impor- tance — and the authenticity — of the crop circle phenomenon. Now, if we could only see that tape from the yellow camera.... Postscript Charles and Diana Later on in the 1990s, I learned that Prince Charles had discovered crop circles on his property and that, in fact, he had actually had them on his land for many years. I also learned that crop circles were reported on land near the Queen ’ s Balmoral castle. At some point, I was contacted by a retired military officer who lived about 20 miles from my home. He told me he was acting as an intermediary for Charles and that the prince was very interested in the phenomenon of crop circles. Of course, Prince Charles could not contact me di- rectly about this, and so I willingly agreed to work with his liaison. At his request, we began to send our newsletter to Prince Charles, and we also sent it to the duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace, who was interested in crop circles as well. Following a series of telephone calls, it was arranged for me to take Charles and Diana on a tour of the fields near their home where the crop circles were appearing, ex- plain to them what was going on, and fill them in on what we have learned about the phenomenon. I agreed to complete confidentiality and can swear that I told no one about the meeting but my wife at the time. I did not even tell my parents or my daughter. The day before our scheduled meet- ing, however, all hell broke loose. The British tabloid newspaper The Star (now defunct) published a front-page story revealing that I was scheduled to take Charles and Diana on a tour of crop circles, and that the prince was obsessed with the phenomenon. Somehow, some- one at the newspaper had gotten hold of this information and they decided to pub- lish it. As I have said, the only one on my side who knew about this was my wife, who I know for a fact did not say a word. This leaves one of two possibilities: Either someone in the British royal family, or someone involved with them, leaked the news to the media; or my phone was tapped. Personally, I suspect the story was leaked from inside Buckingham Palace. As soon as the story broke, I received a frantic phone call from my contact can- celing the meeting. He told me that every- one involved in Charles and Diana ’ s camp was angry and embarrassed by the media debacle. I assured him I had nothing to do with leaking the story, but I am not sure if he — or Charles and Diana — believed me. 26 Chap 14.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 136"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Operation Blackbird / 137 How it got out remains a mystery to this day, although I have my suspicions. Considering that the British intelligence agencies and the British military mounted Operation Blackbird against me and other crop circle researchers, it would not sur- prise me if they took it upon themselves to tap my phone and then leak the news to the press, leaving the British royalty com- pletely out of the decision. I suspect that the military, for some reason, felt it was harmful for the British royal family to ad- mit an interest in crop circles, and thus, if I am correct, they torpedoed the plan by means of public humiliation of me, and Charles and Diana. I have no evidence of this, but it makes sense to me, considering the efforts to which British intelligence had gone in the past to discredit crop circle re- searchers and make them a joke in the mind of the public. It worked, because the result of the tabloid story was to again damage my reputation and belittle my work. Sometime after this unfortunate epi- sode, the same retired military officer con- tacted me and invited me to his home to discuss the possibility of my preparing a technical report summarizing my work on crop circles. I asked him for whom this re- port was intended, and he told me Britain ’ s undersecretary of state for the environment, Nicholas Ridley. Ridley was one of the top five people in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ’ s cabinet and he briefed Mrs. Thatcher daily on matters relevant to the environment. I agreed to provide the re- port, and it was forwarded to Mr. Ridley who then, presumably, advised the prime minister on its contents. I do not know spe- cifically what came of my efforts, but I do know that several members of parliament raised the question of crop circles with the prime minister and home office minister. They wanted to know what the British gov- ernment knew about these formations; what, if any, was their interest in them; and what, if anything, were they doing about them at the governmental level. The chief scientific advisor to the Brit- ish government and to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher responded that the Home Office and Ministry of Defense had no particular interest in crop circles and that they were not believed to pose a threat to the security of the United Kingdom. An important point to emphasize re- garding this position by the British gov- ernment is that they went on the record with their statement that the crop circles were not manmade; thereby confirming that there was, indeed, a phenomenon occur- ring in the fields of England. However, they did not suggest any- thing paranormal or extraterrestrial as its cause. Instead, they stated that they were being created by meteorological forces not yet fully understood. They endorsed the theory that crop circles were formed by a plasma vortex — a new kind of whirlwind or tornado in which electrified air, created in the lee of a hill or by thermal variations, traveled across the fields, leaving geomet- ric formations in its wake. Contradicting this theory, though, was the fact that there were many reports of crop circles appearing in fields around which were no hills for miles, and most reports were of formations appearing at night, which is highly unlikely if the cause were plasma vortices caused by daytime temperature variations. The facts did not line up with their statement, and so those of us researching crop circles knew that there was no real science behind their official declaration. There have been no official statements from the British governments about crop circles since that time.

W e probably should have been suspicious from the moment we first met the young man who claimed to have filmed UFOs making crop circles in a field below Oliver ’ s Castle in England. Why? Partly because the man told us his name was “ Weyleigh. ” My radar, however, did not pick up on the importance of his name at the time. “ Weyleigh ” is a homonym — a sound alike word — for the verb “ waylay, ” which is de- fined, “ to lie in wait for and attack from am- bush, ” or “ to accost or intercept unexpectedly. ” The truth about this man and his phony video were hidden in plain sight, in his very name, and yet none of us saw this until much later. Like Cameras at the Creation If it were true, it would have been one of the most important pieces of film in all of human history. If it were true, it would have, for the first time, captured actual images of UFOs creating a crop circle. How many things we held yesterday as articles of faith which today we tell as fables. — Michel de Montaigne If it were true, it would have made an enormous contribution toward a deeper understanding of the crop circle phenomenon. If the Oliver ’ s Castle video was au- thentic, it would have been on the front page of every newspaper in the world. But alas, it was not real. It was created by John Wabe, a video editor and producer for a film production company called First Cut in Bristol, England. The Oliver ’ s Castle video is a hoax, but as I have re- peatedly said, it is an important hoax. How can a deliberately manufactured piece of video be important in the field of crop circle research? Wouldn ’ t its ultimate impact be to discredit the efforts of those of us who are serious about understanding what is going on, and render all future evi- dentiary artifacts suspect? These are valid questions and legiti- mate concerns, but the key questions that hover over the Oliver ’ s Castle video like the small white UFOs that hover over the Wiltshire field where the snowflake crop formation “ appeared ” are, “ Why would someone go through the trouble — and 27 Chap 15.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 139"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact expense — of putting together such an elaborate hoax? ” and, “ Who was behind it? ” We will explore those questions in this chapter and suggest some possible answers. It is quite possible that there was much more to the Oliver ’ s Castle video than met the eye. On August 11, 1996, a snowflake crop formation appeared in the field at Oliver ’ s Castle, near Devizes, England in Wiltshire. At the time, so the story goes, a man who was using the name of “ John Weyleigh ” was camping on the hilltop of Oliver ’ s Castle overlooking the field, hop- ing to record the formation of a crop circle. Crop formations believed to be authentic had appeared in the area prior to this, so Weyleigh came prepared with a video cam- era and other gear. According to Weyleigh ’ s story, at ap- proximately 5 a.m. on the morning of Au- gust 11, as the first light of the day barely began to creep over the fields, he saw a small sphere of white light pass swiftly across the field directly below his location. He quickly grabbed his video camera and switched it on, but the camera failed to operate because of the excessive moisture in the air. The moisture sensor inside the camera prevented him from capturing the appearance of this initial white sphere, but Weyleigh waited a moment or two, tried the camera again, and that time it worked. He pointed the camera at the field below him and started filming. Just seconds into the filming, two white spheres flew into the frame from the right and arced across the field in a large spiral, mimicking in its flight path the shape of the Julia Set crop formation that had ap- peared at Stonehenge the previous June. As the spheres flew across the field, a small circle of crop suddenly flattened to the ground and, following within seconds, (corroborating what many eyewitnesses of crop circle manifestations had previously reported), a complete, large, complex “ snowflake ” crop pattern materialized. Before the sequence ended, a second pair of white glowing spheres entered the frame from the top left corner, and similarly spi- raled above the crops. As they flew, the pathways and smaller circles in this elabo- rate pattern were formed. The whole filmed sequence is just a few seconds long and my initial reaction upon first viewing it was that it was one of two things: it was either the most incred- ibly important UFO and crop circle film footage of all time, or it was one of the most elaborate frauds ever perpetrated on the world. The following facts gave favor to the film ’ s authenticity: 1. It looked convincing. My personal reaction to the footage was that it fulfilled my expectations as to what we would see if someday someone captured on film the sudden appear- ance of a crop circle. Features of crop circle formation commonly de- scribed by witnesses and in the lit- erature can be seen, especially the speed at which the circles formed. Also, Weyleigh reported being awakened by an electronic trilling sound, the “ crop circle ” sound I have personally witnessed three times and recorded twice. There is an old saying that the secret to the best scams is in the details, and Weyleigh including this sound in his report is truly inspired, because he was attesting to something that had previously been reported by one of the world ’ s authorities on crop circles: me, Colin Andrews. He was inculcating honesty and trustworthi- ness by association. 27 Chap 15.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 140"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Oliver’s Castle Video / 141 2. Several researchers were shown the Oliver ’ s Castle video at the Barge Inn near Devizes at 10:50 p.m., on the evening of August 11, a mere 17 hours after it was allegedly recorded. All it showed were the UFOs. John Weyleigh was the only one who claimed to have seen them “ live. ” 3. Before detailed computer analysis of the film was performed, several film experts stated that the image processing required to blend the two series of events — the formation of the circles and the flight of UFOs — would have required a degree of technical sophistication, as well as the use of professional editing equip- ment. 4. What would the motive be for com- mitting time and money to the cre- ation of an elaborate crop circle hoax video? After the hoax was revealed and a confession obtained, we have since arrived at some conclusions as to why such an operation would be undertaken. There has long been strong suspicion, along with some anec- dotal evidence, that the Oliver ’ s Castle video was part of a gov- ernment-sponsored disinformation campaign to discredit crop circle research. After all, the British gov- ernment did s uccessfully pull off Operation Blackbird. It is not that farfetched to conceive of an on- going disinformation crusade, signed off on at the highest levels of government — on both sides of the Atlantic. Could this have been a government plot? The following factors disprove the film ’ s authenticity: 1. The identity of the man purporting to have filmed the UFOs and the crop circle — John Weyleigh — was dubious. Many attempts to contact him were unsuccessful and much of the information he provided turned out to be false. 2. One of the first things Weyleigh wanted to talk about was money. He offered me a handwritten royalty contract almost immediately and seemed to be very interested in how he could profit from sales and broad- cast of the video. 3. The camera appeared to be already set up for the event, and the crop pattern conveniently formed in the exact center of the frame. The frame did not change during the con- struction of the crop design, even as the spheres left the field. Weyleigh did not follow the flight of the balls of light with his camera, nor did he attempt to zoom in on the original pair of balls, both of which are actions that would be expected if the event and the filming of it were truly spontaneous. The framing of the scene suggested that the cam- eraman already knew about and an- ticipated the arrival of the second pair of spheres. Of course, this in- terpretation would be moot if the footage was created out of “ whole cloth ” in a video editing bay. 4. Weyleigh ’ s comments on the soundtrack of his footage fall short of the level of excitement one would expect of someone witnessing a truly transdimenional event. 5. Many research discoveries publicly attributed to me appear in the se- quence, including: Small UFO spheres seen in the vicinity of the fields where crop circles appear; 27 Chap 15.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 141"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"142 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Army personnel showing an inter- est in crop circles (Weyleigh claims he was approached by a military officer who asked him if he had seen anything, but this encounter was not seen on the tape); the design of the pattern is a snowflake, and I have repeatedly publicly used the phrase “ like a snowflake freezing ” to de- scribe specific patterns. The claim of hearing an electro- static crackling or trilling sound be- fore the crop formation appeared, a direct reference to the crop circle sound I have personally witnessed three times and recorded twice; my repeated statements about the speed at which witnesses report crop circles forming; and the snippet of footage showing the plants oscillat- ing, opening, and dropping to the ground like a fan, a characteristic I have described many times. It was uncanny! Here, in a few seconds of video, were all of the el- ements that were not only typical of authentic crop circle formations, but were also points of information I had spoken and written about countless times during my career. It was as though someone had made notes on elements that I had emphasized over the years, and then said, “ Well, let ’ s be sure to add the sound, and make sure you mention the military guy, and let ’ s make it a snowflake, and let ’ s have the formation appear in less than 10 seconds. ” The pres- ence of all these factors made me suspicious and, it would turn out, for good cause. 6. When my wife Synthia and I first met Mr. “ Weyleigh, ” he was extremely nervous and wanted to leave the mo- ment he obtained my signa ture on a handwritten contract granting me a 10 percent share of all monies earned by the video. Wouldn ’ t the natural emotions after filming such an extraordinary event be elation and excitement? Why was he so anxious, unless he was afraid he would be found out? These suspicions started the wheels turning, and immediately I began to specu- late on the possible reasons why this man would go through the trouble of making such a video if it was, indeed, a hoax. The question, why would he do this? kept playing in a loop in my mind. Why? I concluded that there were three pos- sible reasons for Weyleigh to make the Oliver ’ s Castle video: Money: How would Weyleigh make money from the video? Royalties from sales of the video on VHS and DVD, plus broad- cast fees charged to television stations that wanted to air the video. After Wayleigh was uncovered as “ John Wabe, ” and it was confirmed that the film was a hoax, he came forward, admitted his involvement — and then signed a deal with Nippon TV to par- ticipate in a documentary about the Oliver ’ s Castle video. This led me to believe that he was trying to recoup whatever profits he could from the video after he resigned him- self to accepting that there would be no profit from the sale and airing of the origi- nal video. Mischief: Could it be possible that Wabe would invest his time and money to pro- duce a prank? My initial reaction was “ not bloody likely. ” Yet, in a videotaped confes- sion, Wabe claimed he made the video for “ fun ” and that it would be “ a good laugh. ” He said he had always been interested in crop circles and that he knew that many 27 Chap 15.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 142"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Oliver’s Castle Video / 143 crop circle followers believed UFOs were making them, so he gave them what they expected. A disinformation campaign: This theory posits that Wabe was hired by governmen- tal agencies to make a hoaxed video as part of a broader plan to discredit crop circle researchers. This begs the question: Why would they bother? Wouldn ’ t such a video be done better by NASA or NSA, instead of some small British film editing company? Assuming one of the governments were actually involved, they would have had to have known that their ruse would have been uncovered. After months of speculation, and end- less Internet debate, the truth was uncov- ered: John Weyleigh was actually John Wabe, and he was a video editor for a com- pany called First Cut in Bristol, England. Wabe admitted his involvement in making the film and in disseminating it to myself. I myself never asked for money from any of the media outlets I granted permission to show the Oliver ’ s Castle footage, so the whole effort paid Mr. “ Weyleigh ” nothing for his efforts. Ultimately, the truth is known only to Wabe and his partners, yet fun. His inter- est in signing a royalty contract almost im- mediately, however, is persuasive evidence that they may have also been in it for the money. Postscript In 2002, John “ Weyleigh ” Wabe and his partner John Lomas were editors on a wildlife documentary series called Wild- life , which was produced by the Scandinature production company.

It is a story of the spiritual potential of humans: the potential we have to inter- act with the living force of nature through intuition and geometry to create energeti- cally significant, consciousness-shifting tools. Surprisingly, the majority of crop circle enthusiasts overlook this truth in the belief that only a “ mysterious force ” or “ alien intelligence ” can be the creator of this phenomenon. It may be that a mysteri- ous force or alien intelligence is indeed in- volved, but certainly people are as well. It is interesting that the circles are perceived as valuable only if they are made by a non- human source. It is as if we are afraid to be powerful, co-creative, spiritual beings. Background In July 1999 my husband, Colin Andrews, announced to BBC News the results of his two-year study into hu- man hoaxing of crop circles. His re- search indicated that during the two years of his study , at least 80 percent of the crop circles he researched (in En- gland) were manmade. This announce- ment stunned the crop circle community, largely because Colin was one of the original crop circle research- ers and has been the subject ’ s primary proponent for the last two decades. He started the first research organization, Circles Phenomenon Research Interna- tional (CPRI), and has amassed the larg- est database in the world on the subject. He was in a unique position to evaluate the presently occurring formations against the earlier phenomenon. 28 Chap 16.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 145"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"146 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact The announcement resulted in imme- diate warfare within the established crop circle research community. Prominent al- ternative magazines that purported to deal in truth refused to publish his state- ments. Fellow researchers refuted his report with character assassination rather than with facts. Interestingly, only a hand- ful of people (mostly scientists) paid at- tention to the rest of his statement — that approximately 20 percent of the circles studied showed no evidence of being manmade, and that many of these dem- onstrated a unique magnetic signature. Although Colin continues to work with scientists on the magnetic results, as an intuitive energy healer, I find an equally compelling mystery lies with the manmade formations. Energy healers assist the body ’ s own healing processes by attempting to bring all life systems into harmony through touch, meditation, prayer, and spiritual and organic processes. This can be a compliment to standard medical procedures. The irrefut- able evidence of the effects of this placebo effect proves that not all physical ailments need medical intervention to improve. An energy healer believes that the hu- man body is more than a physical entity. Mind, body, and spirit are unified, coordi- nated, and animated by interacting energy systems. These systems interface between our internal and external environments. If energy functions are weakened, misaligned, or missing altogether, then disharmony and disease result. Although these systems are largely autonomic, they can be influenced by the individual, a process often facilitated by an energy healer. To review the historical and experien- tial record on crop circles: • The first published report of a mys- terious circle appearing in an oat field occurred in 1678. Orange balls of light were witnessed in the sky at the time the circle appeared ( Witch- craft in Hertfordshire by Lewis Evans and H ertfordshire Folk Lore by W.B. Gerish). • The CPRI database contains first- hand reports from farmers of crop circles occurring as early as the 1920s, in many of the same fields in which they appear today. • Originally, the formations were simple circles that evolved into ringed circles and circles with satellites. • The simple formations further evolved during the 1990s into com- plex patterns. • The majority of circles have oc- curred around ancient sacred sites such as Stonehenge, Avebury, and other megalithic complexes. The folklore about these sites includes the same types of experiences re- ported in relation to crop circles. • People entering crop circles expe- rience a sense of spiritual awe. • The phenomenon occurs world- wide. • Many formations display complex geometries. • Many formations display diatonic (musical) ratios between component parts. • There is an association of crop circles with water; sometimes the formations align with watersheds or underground waterways or even cattle troughs. The underground water features are detectable from the air but not from ground level. 28 Chap 16.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 146"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Crop Circle Empowerment / 147 • Magnetic distortions have occurred inside formations affecting com- passes and electrical equipment. Current research is focusing on magnetometer surveys. • A high-pitched, two-toned, electro- magnetic sound has been heard by multiple witnesses on different oc- casions and has been recorded on two occasions. A BBC television crew made one recording and the effect of the sound damaged their electronic equipment. A later broad- cast of the sound also damaged broadcasting equipment. • Some people visiting the circles experience physiological effects including heightened awareness, feeling subtle energies, headaches, and a profound sense of peace. • CPRI research conducted with sci- entist Masahiro Kahata into brainwave patterns indicates that brainwaves are affected by proxim- ity to crop circles. • The circles seem to have healing properties. People claim spontane- ous healings inside some circles. The use of crop circle photographs as healing tools is practiced at the Institute for Resonance Therapy in Germany and with individual Ra- dionics and energy practitioners. The photographs of the crop circles hold a visible record of the patterns and designs and can be very helpful in focusing the intentions of the therapist to heal. In the case of the Institute of Resonant Therapy, computers digitally capture the pho- tograph and, using a proprietary electronic transfer system, applies certain frequencies encoded in the data to the person being healed. • Scientists have found cellular changes in plants associated with crop circles. • Unidentified balls of light have been seen and filmed in and around the formations, as well as in and around megalithic sacred sites. • The patterns are hauntingly familiar and resemble symbols from indig- enous cultures. Seeing the patterns for the first time often has an emo- tional effect on the viewer. • The formations contain dowsable energy, and energy-sensitive indi- viduals, such as Chi Gung master Nan Lu of the American Taoist Healing Center in New York, appar- ently can locate the formations by feeling for the energy with their hands. • The formations usually occur in re- lation to established lines of earth energy, known as ley lines. • The phenomenon is interactive. Pat- terns have appeared in the fields af- ter people have visualized or requested them to appear. Research- ers have often noticed that after they consistently observed a feature and then formulated a hypothesis around it, the next formation would break the rule they had just established. • When Colin Andrews and Pat Delgado made the phenomenon public in 1989 with the publication of Circular Evidence (Bloomsbury Press), more and more people were drawn to the fields, some to visit the 28 Chap 16.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 147"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"148 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact mysterious markings and others to take up the challenge of making them. • Most amazingly, as people have consciously begun to make more of the formations, the anomalies and energy effects surrounding the for- mations continue to occur, even with known hoaxes, regardless of the source of the formation. It is the anomalies that keep people faithful to the idea of either a supernatu- ral force or aliens as the creator of the circles. The term “ supernatural, ” how- ever, merely refers to a natural force that we do not yet understand. When you have stood in a field and watched balls of light move around a crop pat- tern, it is hard to believe that the circle was manmade. However, there are sub- stantial reports of these same anomalies occurring in manmade circles. The appar- ent irreconcilability of these facts is at the foundation of the controversy. It may be time to revise our theories and expand our understanding. A Theory of Energy Humans have been making patterns and geometric structures to shift conscious- ness and move energy for thousands of years. Zuni sand paintings, Tibetan yantras, and Indian mandalas are a few examples of geometric patterns used in this way. The most extravagant examples of energy shift- ing geometric tools may be Stonehenge in England and the Great Pyramid in Egypt. It is noteworthy that Old English folklore establishes Stonehenge and other stone circles as sites of spontaneous healing, observation points for strange lights, and places where lightning seems to gravitate 1 . The original discoverer of ley lines, Alfred Watkins, author of The Old Straight Track 2 believed that Stonehenge and other megalithic monuments are linked together through energy pathways. The relation- ship of ancient sacred sites to underground waterways is also well established. Addi- tionally, the Great Pyramid ’ s energy effects, particularly those on physiology, have been the focus of much study 3 . What all of these ancient monuments have in common is that they use sacred geometry to constrain and direct subtle energy for a specific effect. Paul Devereux writes in his book Se- cret of Ancient and Sacred Places : Sacred geometry is the geom- etry inherent in all nature, whether it be the energy dance of atoms and molecules, the formation of a crys- tal, the growth of a plant or human skeleton, the motion of weather sys- tems or galaxies. Certain patterns and ratios are used by nature in the formation of the manifest uni- verse: The process of becoming is governed by the implied geometry. Such geometry is used in magi- cal invocation for the same reasons. The builders of the ancient sacred monuments observed the ways of nature closely and encoded its ar- chitecture into their structures so that the holy places would act as microcosms of the whole universe 4 . Can it be that crop circles, in utilizing sacred geometry at energy centers, activate a heretofore unmeasured energy inherent in nature? John Michell writes in his book The New View over Atlantis 5 : From the relics of the Stone-age science practiced by the adepts of the ancient world it appears: first, that they recognized the existence of natu- ral forces of whose potential we are now ignorant, and learnt to manipu- late them; second, that they gained 28 Chap 16.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 148"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Crop Circle Empowerment / 149 thereby certain insights into funda- mental questions of philosophy, the nature of the universe and the re- lationship between life and death. He continues: “ The work of scientists such as Baron C. von Reichenbach and Dr. Wilhelm Reich, further confirms the pos- sibility, indicated in folklore all over the world, that some form of natural energy was known in prehistoric times and that a method was discovered, involving a fusion of the terrestrial spirit with the solar spark, by which this energy could be disposed to human benefit. ” 6 Is it possible that in mak- ing crop circles today, as in ancient times, humans are the “ terrestrial spirit ” fusing with the “ solar spark, ” thereby activating a powerful force of nature? I am suggesting that what we think of as causes are really effects. When biolo- gists see cellular changes in plants within formations, the popular conclusion is that a powerful force must have been engaged to create the circle. But what if it is the reverse? What if a powerful force was re- leased as the result of creating the circle? The evidence shows that ancient sa- cred sites are aligned to unseen under- ground waterways and ley lines. It is believed this system was part of a subtle energy matrix the sites were activating and releasing for human use. Researchers have noted the same correlations and similar effects with crop circles, including the same types of dowsing results. It is also interest- ing that both crop circles and sacred sites are associated with reports of strange lights in the sky and UFO activity. Do they come because they are drawn to the earth energy being activated? Are the objects that have been filmed in crop circles making the circles, exploring them, or utilizing their energy? Dr. Hans Jennings has demonstrated that sound waves create patterns by vibrating particles into specific geometries. Chang- ing the frequency of the sound changes the geometry of the vibrating particles 7 . Some researchers have speculated that sound waves may have vibrated crops into geo- metric patterns, thereby creating crop circles. Isn ’ t it equally possible that the cre- ation of a living geometry generates a fre- quency that produces the observed and recorded sound and activates the energy effects associated with crop circles? We live in a unique time in history during which the arcane knowledge and mythology of the past are fusing with the science of the present. Nowhere is this more in evidence than in the field of medi- cine. Modern medicine is open in a way it has never been before to alternative and complementary medicine theories based on subtle energy. Some of these healing mo- dalities, such as Radionics and Reiki, cre- ate patterns and symbols that establish precise frequencies and induce specific healing effects. The healing frequencies are used to shift mind and/or matter. Is it pos- sible that the crop circles are working in the same way? Results at the Institute for Resonance Therapy (IRT) in Cappenberg, Germany suggest they do. At IRT, crop circle photographs are used in a complex, repeatable protocol for healing processes. They have been used to revitalize forests and improve farming yields, among others. 8 Another piece to the puzzle may be seen in the work of nature-energy pioneers such as the founders of Findhorn in Scot- land and Perelandra in the United States. Michelle Small Wright, founder of Perelandra, has documented in her books the process of what she calls “ co-creative science ” . 9 In her work she communicates with the intelligence within nature and uses geometrical designs to create energy gar- dens. As at Findhorn, her gardens exceed the limits imposed by natural laws, as we 28 Chap 16.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 149"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"150 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact know them. Forty-pound cabbages grown in the barren rock of northern Scotland would be unbelievable if not seen. Wright describes this ability to transcend natural limits as the spiritual growth of humans join- ing with nature to become co-creators of the world around us. In fact, we are al- ready co-creators of the world around us, we simply do it without consciousness or intention — look at the chaos of modern times. Perhaps we are being called to re- turn to ancient ways and be co-creative with nature as a matter of choice, not de- fault, and with conscious intent. Perhaps crop circles are a step in this direction. This theory is already being utilized in California by Mr. Bill Witherspoon, who makes patterns in the landscape with the intention of changing the field of conscious- ness. 10 Wouldn ’ t it be wonderful if people in all walks of life and places on the earth began to consciously use geometry and natural energy in their gardens, landscapes, homes, offices, and communities? Is this simply a return to the ancient Chinese prac- tice of feng shui? The Cost of Deception Why some researchers and hoaxers alike want to obscure the truth of the manmade formations is interesting. Despite the hate mail and raging controversy over Colin ’ s disclosure, most crop circle re- searchers are already aware that humans are constructing circles. In 1997, Colin first began his in-depth investigation into manmade formations. He hired a detective to track hoaxers and create a profile for distinguishing manmade circles. At this time, farmers were losing patience with the hoards of people trampling their fields whenever a formation appeared. To elicit their cooperation in his study, Colin agreed to provide the farmers with details of any known circle-making activity that occurred on their land. We expected support from the crop circle research community in Colin ’ s efforts to reduce manmade activ- ity, but much to our surprise this generated an angry furor. Some researchers went so far as to ask Colin to stop because “ why ruin everyone ’ s fun? ” In August of 1998, Colin and I attended a gathering of several researchers at a sea- side restaurant in Southsea, Portsmouth. Photographer Steve Alexander and Karen Douglas were present. During the discus- sion Karen and Steve began to explain why they believed it was a poor decision on Colin ’ s part to expose the hoaxers. Karen explained her thoughts on the value of hoax- ing by describing the experience she had while constructing a circle with Steve for research purposes several years earlier. 11 Karen ’ s description included how beautiful it was to be out in the quiet of the night, joining nature, and in harmony with the land- scape as they created a magical formation. She went on to suggest that exposing people for their role in creating these sa- cred formations was misguided. I actually agree with Karen ’ s assessment of the value of manmade circles. But why keep the method of creation a secret? If manmade formations are a valuable asset, why not show everyone how creating sacred ge- ometry in nature can create sacred space and be a tool of empowerment? Other circlemakers describe experi- ences similar to Karen ’ s. In October of 1996, Colin and I were in Finland at a UFO convention at which Colin was speaking. Present in the audience was Robert Irving, a well-known circle maker. At some point during the proceedings, Irving introduced himself and asked to have a meeting. We agreed to meet in the conference cafeteria. The conversation was so interesting we continued it the next day in downtown Helsinki. At the time, Colin was still re- sisting his growing alarm at the possibility that many formations were manmade, and 28 Chap 16.p65 2/11/03, 4:52 PM 150"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Crop Circle Empowerment / 151 I was personally quite hostile. I must say I ended up with a great deal of respect and genuine liking for Robert Irving. Irving had been involved in circle mak- ing since the early 1990s and was corrobo- rative in much of his detail, confirming site information that Colin knew was privileged information between himself and few other researchers. More interesting, Irving dis- cussed some personal experiences he had while making the circles. He, like many circlemakers, claim unusual experiences in the fields while creating formations. They speak of lights appearing in the fields while they are working; about de- signing a pattern, going into the field to make the pattern, and creating an entirely differ- ent design — one with symbolic impact, or one that had been previously meditated on by individuals or groups. John Macnish, in his book Crop Circle Apoca lypse , 12 writes that the first avowed circlemakers, Doug and Dave, felt compelled “ by an unknown source ” to go out into the fields at night and create patterns. To illustrate his motivations in mak- ing formations, Irving related an event during which he entered a pattern the morning after he and several others had made it. A number of people were in the formation and Irving was enjoying hear- ing their comments, praises, and impres- sions. He reported witnessing a woman ’ s swollen ankle significantly reduce in size while she was in the formation. When I asked him directly why circlemakers didn ’ t acknowledge the artwork they created, he said that for him, if people knew they were manmade, the magic results would stop happening. It seemed his opinion was that the energy effects were induced by the person ’ s belief in the mysterious source of the circles. I disagree. I think the effects are real, palpable, and part of ancient knowledge. This remarkable 200 foot diameter design was positioned precisely in the center of an old Roman road which could only be seen from hundreds of feet up in an aircraft, making its positioning from the ground almost impossible. 28 Chap 16.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 151"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact We live in a time when we need to be- come more conscious, where we need, in Colin ’ s words, “ to recognize our place in the natural world ” and find the tools of empow- erment necessary to change the direction in which we are heading. If crop circles are a part of that, it is time to stop hiding from the truth and pretending people are not a part of the magic and mystery. Aliens, or a mysteri- ous force, may have originated the circles and may still make some or inspire the mak- ing of others. Perhaps we are in training. The importance is that we can use geometries and natural forces to change our consciousness and in so doing, the world in which we live. The cost of deception, of ignoring the human component, is the loss of the opportu- nity for spiritual growth. We have the choice to either give our power to an outside source, or to embrace our own abilities. Let us ac- cept our spiritual evolution and consciously begin our training in co-creative living.

That day, I announced the outcome of a two-year long magnetometer survey of crop circles in England, along with my find- ings from this investigation into the crop circle hoaxing problem. People who had a serious interest in the crop circle phenomenon — and I am speaking of those who fervently believed that all crop circles were of paranormal origin — thought their world had come to an end that day.

During the mid-1990s, I was shown confidential information by a BBC journal- ist who had gone undercover for two years, and who had worked closely with Dave Chorley and Doug Bowers — the two most famous crop circle hoaxers — in an attempt to establish the truth behind their claims to be making all the crop circles in England. I was shown letters mailed by Doug and Dave that contained the hand-drawn patterns of crop circles that they planned to make in Hampshire and Wiltshire, and also provided dates and places for the for- mations. On the envelopes of some of these letters, they had sketched the planned de- sign and then placed a stamp over it. The envelopes had then been postmarked by the Royal Mail. These patterns did appear, and they appeared where and when the letters had said they would. On one occasion, Doug and Dave even made a crop design as a 29 chap 17.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 153"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact birthday surprise for the reporter ’ s young son. Unbeknown to Doug and Dave, though, they were being filmed by this BBC journalist as they made their circles, and in ensuing weeks, other hoaxers were tracked and their handiwork was also filmed. This information was devastating to me . Frankly, I did not want to believe the evidence being shown to me, as others now do not want to believe me. To satisfy my own desire and need for the truth, I began my own investigation into human hoaxing of crop circles. They Laid It Down for All to See In 1999, I began my investigation into hoaxing. I was fortunate and grateful to have the project fully funded by well-known philanthropist Laurence Rockefeller as part of an overall crop circle research funding package provided by Mr. Rockefeller himself. Mr. Rockefeller has funded a number of my research projects into the crop circle mystery, beginning in July 1997, when one of his close advisors asked if I would be inter- ested in submitting for funding consid- eration a proposal for a long-term program of research. My proposal was accepted and, in 1999, I turned my at- tention to investigating crop circle coun- terfeiting. My hoaxing investigation took place in England during 1999 and 2000. My research included engaging retired police detectives as private investigators; crop circle site inspections; collection of physical evidence; extensive aerial photog- raphy; recording of personal experiences; and gathering information from the media. By this time, several media organi- zations in London and elsewhere, includ- ing NBC, the BBC, Nippon TV, Sky TV, and others, had paid people to create crop formations for television programs. We were fortunate to receive help from many of these media outlets in the form of in- formation as to when crop formations would be made, who would be making them, and where they would be located. We also enlisted the help of undercover researchers who were able to infiltrate the hoaxers and convince them that they could be trusted. Once we had concrete evidence that a crop circle was manmade, we went in and recorded the ground details of the forma- tion with great specificity. We were then able to look for these same details in aerial photographs taken of all the patterns in England during those two years. In many of the designs we investigated, we not only found underlying tracks where people had gained access to vital construc- tion points, but also peg holes were found where lay-out stakes had been used and then removed. When these documented facts were combined with the undercover films of people making crop circles, we were able to reach accurate conclusions as to the number of formations that were hoaxed in England during that period. This was unassailable evidence, and yet it was still not enough for those cereozealots who insisted on believing that every crop circle was “ real. ” Based on our research, I concluded that approximately 80 percent of all the crop circles we investigated in England from 1999 through the year 2000 were manmade. This was one of the most important research findings to date because it cut to the core of what was truly important: the remaining 20 percent of the crop circles showed no sign of human hands. 29 chap 17.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 154"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The “80/20” Statement / 155 And the Band Begins to Play It all began the morning of August 6, 2000. I received a telephone call at my U.K. research base in Andover, England from Francesca Kasteliz of the BBC National News in London. She asked a simple question: Did I have any new crop circle research devel- opments to report? My answer to that question, and the events that soon followed, set in motion an extraordinary wave of change; some- thing that caused joy, as well as anger — more anger than anything I have ever witnessed in my life — in the crop circle community. Two days after agreeing to share my latest findings with the BBC, I was stand- ing in a large simple crop circle at Alton Barnes, Wiltshire with an array of televi- sion cameras pointed at me. I had arrived at approximately 7:30 a.m. as the crew were raising the transmit- ter mast up into the overcast sky, and mak- ing their final preparations for a live broadcast. The TV journalist who would be in- terviewing me arrived shortly thereafter, and we chatted briefly as we awaited the word that the segment would begin. We were minutes from broadcasting the lat- est crop circle news live throughout Great Britain. As is common in England, there was a heavy fog hugging the field in which we stood that morning, and fog also blanketed the hills behind us. The director was hop- ing the haze would lift in time for the broad- cast. There was a complex, manmade crop formation in the field adjacent to ours, and he hoped to show it on camera during the airing of my interview. Unfortunately, the weather did not co- operate this day, and when we went on the air, the director had to be satisfied with showing only the simple circle in which I stood. I found this truly ironic. Nature had spoken and she had decided that the com- plex, manmade designs were to be re- moved from the equation — at least for this broadcast. During the interview, I stated that most of the complex crop circle designs that we had investigated were judged to have been manmade, but that approximately 20 per- cent of those that we had researched were not. I then went on to explain that what was significant about our findings was that in that 20 percent, magnetic anomalies had been conclusively recorded and measured and, again, these readings were only found in the simple circles. As I spoke, the BBC showed elabo- rate animated computer graphics illustrat- ing how magnetism may play a role in the creation of simple circles. My interviewer then concluded the interview by saying, “ Well, the mystery remains. ” Overall, it was a well-produced seg- ment, and I believed that I had succeeded in communicating my findings to the world. At the time, I had no idea what kind of response my words would provoke. That evening, the first hate mail arrived in the form of venomous e-mails. This was followed in the ensuing days by similar noxious missives in my mailbox. Then the verbal attacks came from researchers and members of the public who had not taken kindly to what I had revealed. I was barred from farmers ’ fields where I had worked without interference many times; and I was “ disinvited ” from a well-known U.S. ra- dio program by the host, who denounced me as a “ deliberate disinformer. ” In a let- ter to me, the host told me that he was cer- tain that I had been lying about my findings. Around the same time, an article began cir- culating on the Internet in which the author 29 chap 17.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 155"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact accused me of having been “ bought off ” by the Rockefeller family. An international magazine refused to publish details of my research and results, instead adding to the anti-Colin-Andrews rhetoric by stating that I was either a funded disinformer in the employ of the Rockefeller family, or that I was being paid by the CIA to deliberately spread disinformation. I was stunned by the vitriol that was hurled my way, and I learned a great deal about people during this experience. In the minds of many, my statement had crossed the line and instantly transformed me into an enemy. I had evidence to bol- ster my conclusions, but none of that mattered. I had said something certain people had not wanted to hear, and thus, I was ostracized from the crop circle community. I tried to ignore a great deal of this unpleasant nonsense, but I was not always successful in avoiding confrontations. On several occasions, my way into the fields was blocked by angry researchers or rabid believers who not only physically prevented me from doing my work, but also insisted on confronting me personally so that they could express their feelings to me about what I had said. Grown men stood nose to nose with me, shouting into my face, spouting crazed non- sense with uncontrolled fury. The behavior of some of these fanatics was abominable, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Thankfully, the situation has improved somewhat. In recent months, I have been given the opportunity to discuss my findings on televi- sion, radio, and in print, and what has also tempered the reaction to my conclusions is the fact that others — independent research- ers with whom I have nothing to do with — are arriving at the same conclusions. That said, though, I must acknowledge that there still exists today an extreme fringe faction of crop circle devotees who not only believe that all the patterns around the world are “ real, ” but are hell-bent on the public believing likewise. One example of this type of blind de- nial occurred during one of my appearances on the hugely popular U.S. radio program Coast to Coast with Art Bell during the summer of 2002. On this occasion, George Noory was hosting the show, and we had already been on the air for two hours when a caller phoned in to have his say about my work and my “ 80/20 ” conclusion. “ Everything you have just said is not true, ” he proclaimed. “ What is not true? ” George replied. “ I have not heard him say a single thing that I thought was untrue or, for that mat- ter, unreasonable. ” The caller “ non-answered ” George ’ s question by responding, “ It ’ s just not true. Ask other researchers like Michael Glickman or Andy Thomas. ” I then asked George if I could speak with this caller myself and answer his ques- tions, but as is often the case in these type of situations, the caller hung up when George began to challenge his claims. The reaction by many in this camp seems to be “ Don ’ t tell me something I don ’ t want to hear. ” It is not simple dis- agreement. It appears to be an inability to modify their position in the face of new facts. I believe it is critically important that those who are finding it difficult to accept these new discoveries not allow denial to pummel them into blindness. Denial and deception — the other “ D & D ”— are synonymous with Doug and Dave in the crop circle field, and the meta- phor is apt: Doug and Dave practiced de- ception and denial for years, and even after they admitted that they were responsible for some circlemaking, they continued to 29 chap 17.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 156"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The “80/20” Statement / 157 deceive by laying claim to formations they had nothing to do with. Hearing Troubles With hindsight, I now know that my 80/20 statement was wildly misunderstood. It was misinterpreted as me saying that all crop circles are manmade, when I had gone to great pains at the time, and have continued to do so ever since, to make it clear that the mysterious, unexplainable 20 percent was a gift to mankind. My state- ment was also misinterpreted as me say- ing that 80 percent of crop formations around the world , and spanning all of his- tory , were manmade. As I said then, and will say yet again, I was referring to the crop circles we investigated in England , in the specific two-year period during which we conducted our research. I rocked the boat. I understood why this happened: Mine was the loudest voice out there reporting the results and supporting the research. It was my face that was seen on TV, and my voice that was heard on the radio. It was my findings that were being written about in books, newspapers, and maga- zines; and I was the one lecturing around the world about my conclusions. There is some small measure of satis- faction in the fact that since that notorious BBC interview aired, a number of other crop circle researchers have publicly agreed with my findings. It staggers me to realize to what extent people will go to hang on to their beliefs, and how hard it is for many to accept change — even when they are presented with evidence of the truth. I have repeatedly said that to prove just one crop circle real is to establish the pres- ence of a very important phenomenon on Earth. I committed thousands of dollars, along with a great deal of professional expertise and expensive equipment, towards prov- ing that 54 crop circle events in the United Kingdom, out of an event total of 236 coun- trywide crop formations during those two years, could not be explained. If we extrapolate, and apply that number ’ s ratio to the formations reported in the rest of the world during 1999 and 2000 — 236 in 1999, and 175 in 2000 — then 82 of the 411 confirmed worldwide crop circle reports would be unexplained. A few days after the BBC television news program aired, I received an invita- tion from Professor Andrei Ol ’ khovatov in Moscow to present my findings at a Geo- physicist Congress in Russia, planned to discuss the Tunguska explosion event of 1908. Magnetometer anomalies had been dis- covered at the Tunguska site, and the Rus- sian scientists wanted to check their findings against the magnetometer readings I recorded in authentic crop circles. The Russian scientists wanted to learn more about the real crop circles, especially after hearing that my research had deter- mined that there was, indeed, a baffling mystery in the crop circle phenomenon. They were especially intrigued by findings showing that numerous simple crop de- signs had strange magnetic anomalies as- sociated with them. ••• I have often been asked why I made my announcement before conferring with my fellow researchers and allowing a peer review process to confirm my results. It ’ s a good question. The answer is that I felt then — and, in fact, I still feel — a strong sense of soci- etal, scientific, and moral responsibility sur- rounding my work. I carry the unasked-for title of best-known voice on the subject of crop circles and I feel strongly that my role is to keep everyone informed .

It is very important that the truth be told. What is happening on earth with the “ signs ” of the crop circles is of great sig- nificance to many cultures. The council of Hopi Elders, for in- stance, are the caretakers of a prophecy that has been kept secret for hundreds of years.

What I Know Now That I Did Not Know Then About Crop Circles: • There is a real mystery involved in their creation and in their purpose. • They frequently appear in ancient places. • The geometries of crop circles are found in the artifacts of ancient cul- tures, especially their writings and artwork. • There are “ hot spots ” of crop circle activity around the world. • Absolute proof of a real phenom- enon is elusive using current scien- tific technology. • The symbols seen in crop circles often bring together a wide range of people. • The vast majority of crop circles appear in vegetation which we later consume. • Crop circles attract extraordinary at- tention when they appear. • The patterns have evolved over time, and some designs now have identifiable meaning. • There is frequently a high level of interference with electronic equip- ment inside the crop circles. About People: • A cult-like, pseudoreligious obses- sion with the crop circle mystery has formed more quickly than I would have ever expected. • Crop circles are now perceived by some people to hold great spiritual I am half scientist and half intuitive. — Colin Andrews 30 chap 18.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 159"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"160 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact meaning, as well as possible scien- tific potential, and this has sparked creative thinking and new ideas in many who are studying the phe- nomenon. The mystery has become a catalyst for the pursuit of knowl- edge. • Fear of the unknown has created a faction of organized, vocal skeptics, a group whose voices sometimes seem to be louder than those of the individuals objectively seeking the truth. • Religious belief systems are chal- lenged by the crop circle enigma. People who are committed to a par- ticular religious philosophy feel ill at ease attributing any profound meaning or significance to the crop circle mystery. • Some of the first people to respond to my research findings were repre- sentatives from intelligence organi- zations in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Many of them infiltrated research groups, and some even visited researcher ’ s homes and spoke to their families in an effort to acquire information about the burgeoning crop circle mystery. • The benign and beautiful subject of crop circles has provided a unique glimpse into human behavior, and I often think that we have learned more in the past 20 years about people, than about crop circles. Sad to say, not all of what we have learned about the behavior of cer- tain members of the human family is encouraging. ••• Nothing you read anywhere — not even in this book — will fully explain the crop circle mystery; not today or even tomorrow. The enigma may never be fully ex- plained, but I am certain that we are being given hints as to where it comes from, and where it might be going. These hints are fascinating, and they fill me with intrigue and excitement. But not having all the answers does not mean that we should stop using our imagination in an attempt to understand. Imagining possible futures and searching for answers is what drives the evolving engine of hu- man potential, and it is what contributes to the growth of our human civilization. It is quite possible that mankind will never fully understand the intricate work- ings of the master plan of our existence. But we are regularly being given hints and clues, and I think that many of us have evolved enough to intuitively sense when we are being presented with glimpses of the underlying structure of this master plan. The crop circle mystery could simply be outside our realm of understanding. The answers may be locked in a dimension somewhere external to the boundaries of our current reality. Some crop researchers have speculated that the crop circle patterns are visible energy discharges between di- mensions, and that we can only see half (or less) of the actual anomaly. That may be true, and the theory illustrates the diffi- culties — knowing what to consider and what to reject — when working with the crop circle riddle. We are now living in an age of micro- biology, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology. We are regularly creating new materials and developing new tech- niques that allow us to employ the highest levels of technological skills known to man 30 chap 18.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 160"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Half and Half / 161 in our pursuit of knowledge. Eyeing some hoped-for human benefit, we are now able to combine genes from the plant kingdom with genes from the animal kingdom. Man can now play God, but as we enter the 21st century acting as God, we should under- stand that this does not make us God. One alarming reality of our current bio- technological developments and genetic manipulations is that there is not a single scientist working in this field today who can state with certainty what the effect on other species, the environment, or man himself will be from incorporating these new, genetically contrived creations into nature. This lack of knowledge, however, has not stopped or prevented the introduction of these products into the biosphere. To- day, 65 percent of all soybeans packaged for human consumption in the United States are genetically altered. Only time will tell what the effects are of the incor- poration of genetically altered foods and animals into the human gene pool. Those of you reading this book are see- ing through eyes that see what no one of any other era has seen. We have seen man unleash the power of the atom to produce both extraordinary levels of energy, and an extraordinary power to destroy. And we did this before we fully understood the ramifi- cations of such a monumental act, and be- fore we knew what to do with the byproducts of nuclear energy. We now store radioactive materials under mountains, but this does not assure the safety of mankind. Only metal cans and concrete stand be- tween us and deadly harm. And to make matters worse, some nations simply dump their nuclear waste into the sea. These are frightening realities of our modern age, and another of those realities is that we live in troubling times with more questions than answers. Curiously, into this amalgam of threats comes the crop circles: What do the crop circles mean to us? I believe that we need to understand the role that human consciousness plays in the crop circle enigma. Darwin was right: On this planet, only the fittest survive. But that oversimplifies the paradigm of life on earth by not factoring in the will of a species to survive — consciously or un- consciously — and how deliberately applied means of survival affect this equation. I believe that all species on earth feel the constant threat of extinction. Call it the “ high mind ”— another term for Jung ’ s col- lective unconscious — a sensory self that registers and responds to threats on a purely instinctual basis. Animals instinctively use strength and/or flight (depending upon the threatening animal) to maintain their place in the ecology. Man also uses the ability to dominate both animals and other humans, but there is an additional factor in man ’ s quest for survival. We can use our spiritual aware- ness, our intelligence, and our emotional identity to apply compassion, love, and empathy to our actions. These emotions are quite powerful and cannot be faked (al- though many politicians, in their quest for power and wealth, try to fake feelings on a regular basis). When our intentions are sin- cere and deeply held, the results can be amazing. In the beginning days of my research into crop circles, I realized that the clues — and sometimes the answers — that I sought were often provided for me if I prayed qui- etly, with an open heart, and endeavoring to maintain a genuineness and sincerity in my requests. I have experienced some incredible things. And what was common to all of my most profound revelations was that I had asked not for a final answer, but instead, 30 chap 18.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 161"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"162 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact for true knowledge and spiritual awareness. From those prayers came a glorious event or stunning clue that helped shine a brighter light on this puzzling enigma. I have heard both male and female voices speaking to me in single, sometimes cryptic sentences. I have had a Celtic Cross crop pattern appear close to my home shortly after I prayed for just such a sym- bol. I have heard strange sounds inside crop circles that still cannot be explained. And I am not alone in these experiences. Other sincere researchers have reported similar happenings. Here are two of the most intriguing examples: • Filmmaker William Gazecki told me that when he arrived in England to start filming his movie Crop Circles: Quest for Truth , he asked for a crop circle to appear and one did — right outside his bedroom win- dow that night. • Inventor and engineer Mike Curry left a surveillance operation at Blackland, Wiltshire after having wit- nessed a dumbbell crop formation appear in a field fully monitored and protected by cameras and infrared beams to stop intruders. Even with all this surveillance, the crop pattern appeared unbidden, in a small bank of fog and without detection or be- ing seen by the cameras. Mike left the site frustrated and confused, re- peatedly asking the question: Could this happen anywhere and at any time? He was still puzzled when he arrived at his home, which is sev- eral hundred miles north of the surveillance site. He woke the next day to find the identical crop design in the field outside his bed- room window. Also, there have been many occasions when it seems as though the creators of the circles have listened in on conversations between researchers and then acted in re- sponse to what was specifically discussed. One day, while flying over southern England with Busty Taylor, Busty com- mented to me that he would love to some- day find all the previous crop designs wrapped into one stunning new formation. The next day, just such a formation ap- peared, precisely below where the aircraft had been when Busty had expressed his wish 24 hours earlier. Pat Delgado and I were once discuss- ing the law of angular momentum, the law of physics that describes the direction and velocity of spin in natural vortices. We were standing in a field at the time and talking about the fact that all the crop circles that had rings around them complied with this law. The next day a new crop circle ap- peared in the field next to where we had stood. This new formation, for the first time in our research, did not comply with the law of angular momentum. The examples are numerous, and they have convinced me that some form of in- telligence is involved in this mystery, and that this intelligence seems to be aware of our thoughts. I began to hint at this con- clusion publicly towards the end of the 1980s. But I completely agree with those who say that extraordinary claims need to be backed up with extraordinary evidence. In the case of these crop circle experi- ences, this is difficult, for how does one sci- entifically prove — after the fact — that any one of the people involved did pray, or did make the statements they claim to have made? The demand for that evidence and the questions of skeptics are impor tant to 30 chap 18.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 162"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Half and Half / 163 public debate, however, and are an impor- tant part of understanding the crop circle phenomenon. Over time, I have established cordial, yet guarded, relationships with some of the people making counterfeit crop circles. Many of them have told me of strange experiences in the fields while making crop circles, and some of these events so closely resembled what I, along with other serious researchers, had wit- nessed, that sometimes I felt as though I was listening to myself, or one of my col- leagues talking. Some of these circlemakers had seen globes flying above the fields, inexplicable flashes of light, sudden shadows, and many other anomalous happenings. One of these counterfeiters is a man named Rodney Dickinson, who is from a group in London using the unfortunate name of “ Team Satan, ” (although they also call themselves the Circlemakers). Rodney has taken several of the most impressive photographs of UFOs ever seen. Rodney also has videotaped UFOs and is credited with some of the best UFO footage ever obtained. All of Rodney ’ s photographic evidence of UFOs was shot from inside crop circles. I have received similar reports from many other hoaxers, and I have concluded that it is possible that they may have some- thing significant to contribute to the pic- ture. Of course, all the work of the serious researchers would be much easier if the hoaxers would simply stop doing what they are doing, but that is unlikely, and it seems as though the phenomenon has begun to use them in its own mystifying way. If researchers and hoaxers have the same paranormal experiences in and around crop circles, whether the circles are manmade or genuine, we have a very interesting situation. Both sides of this equation witness the paranormal, and yet each interprets these events within the con- text of their own reality. The researchers are trying to prove that some of the crop circles on earth are “ real, ” while the hoax- ers attempt to test these claims with coun- terfeits. It is while this dance goes on that the major clues manifest themselves and, hopefully, some day, we will all see the com- plete picture. I believe that we are all involved in some kind of experiment with consciousness. None of us now know whose experi- ment it is, but if it does not belong to an off-planet source, then we should own it ourselves, because it may be important to our future. Something strange is going on, and I think the hearts and souls of the research- ers and hoaxers hold the answers. I be- lieve that our God-given ability to think and act with highly evolved brain functions, manifested in such elevated emotions as love and compassion, links us to the Di- vine. When we explore the crop circle phe- nomenon with these qualities in place, an emotional energy is produced that seems to put us “ online ” with the creators of the crop circles. As all lifeforms live and die by the message codes of their DNA, so, perhaps, is the message of the crop circles similarly encoded, and honesty and an open heart are the keys to a true under- standing of this communication. I do think that this makes sense, and that it helps to explain why these strange things happen at places where crop circle researchers and crop circle counterfeit- ers regularly meet: inside the crop circles. A fascinating element of the mystery is the glowing orbs that are regularly seen near, and occasionally inside the crop circles. They have been witnessed and filmed many times and I have no doubt that 30 chap 18.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 163"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"164 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact they are real and that they have something to do with the intelligence behind crop circles. I saw my first ball of light in 1986 while waiting for Dr. Terrence Meaden at a crop formation. The orb moved behind the only small cumulus cloud in that part of the sky and remained there. The moment I locked onto it with my eyes, it suddenly seemed to be aware of me and it began to move in a deliberate manner, almost as if it were toying with me. Also, when I later asked for some kind of clue as to the true nature of the crop circles, the alarming “ crop circle sound ” began and I became quite afraid. As soon as I became fearful, the noise stopped, as if the source of the sound was aware of my fear and responded to restore an emotional balance for me. How much of this was created by my own mind? Skeptics will tell you, “ all of it. ” But could it be that the orbs are not machines built by some alien beings, but are “ nature ’ s machines ”— visual manifes- tations of some kind of natural energy that serve to connect one dimension to another? ••• There seems to be a yin/yang paradigm in the game that is being jointly played out by the researchers and the hoaxers. Is it possible that the players on both sides of the game board are vital to the ultimate un- derstanding of the mystery, and that the answers will be found in a study of human consciousness? After two decades of research I can not say how the crop circles are made but, per- haps more importantly, I believe I know why. I believe that human beings are an essential and integral part of what is oc- curring in the crop fields around the world — in what is manifesting as crop circles. The designs encompass both spiritual and natu ral elements, some of which can be “ read ” mathematically. I be- lieve that they are being offered to us at a time when our “ living ” planet is in trouble, much of which we ourselves have caused. I think we are being summoned to ad- dress these problems, but first we must come to terms with ourselves and ask the questions, “ Who are we? ” and “ What con- tributions can we make that will benefit all life on earth? ” We may never know why we are here. But we do know that we are here as a species, and that we need to de- termine our ultimate fate. We have limited resources on Earth. Sharing these fragile gifts should be our highest priority as we enter this new and critical millennium. If we do not recognize our interconnectedness with all of nature, then we will continue our environmental — and spiritual — downslide. Our future, and the future of all life on earth, will depend upon respecting our- selves, and respecting the living planet. We all have to share this responsibility. I believe that all of this ties in with crop circle consciousness. We are being challenged to learn, and the tools of our instruction are ancient spiri- tual symbols, mandalas, and other innate, natural patterns. We are being touched by the angels, and given the chance to learn about ourselves. Since 1975, there has been a consis- tent cascade of beautiful crop circles, and there were random reports of formations even earlier. This coincides with a time of extraor- dinary and unprecedented changes in our world. Human survival seems threatened in ways never before seen — profound envi- ronmental degradation, war and the threat of war, political upheaval, terrorism of all types, religious conflict, poverty, starvation, 30 chap 18.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 164"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Half and Half / 165 natural disasters, and more. And yet now, with the Damoclean sword of extinction hanging over our head, the signs of con- tact appeared. Who — or what — is making contact with us? It is not yet clear if we have made con- tact with a paradimensional part of our- selves, or with something or someone else. Scientists at Purdue University, doing re- search funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, have discovered the possible exist- ence of other dimensions outside the three spatial dimensions of length, width, and height. In a paper published in the Novem- ber 4, 2002 issue of Physical Review Let- ters , Purdue physics professor Ephraim Fischbach wrote, “ A new kind of gravity- like force would be the fingerprint of the fact that we may really live in a world that is more than three spatial dimensions. You wouldn ’ t see this force over large distances, but you could see it over small distances. ” Some crop circle theorists have long sug- gested that the crop patterns may be energy signatures from another dimension. If this is the case, and we are, indeed living in more than three dimensions, then it is quite pos- sible that some yet-to-be identified energy, which may be part of human consciousness, is playing a role in the crop circle enigma. I believe that what is taking place in the fields of our planet is evidence of signs of contact, and that the orbs and other as- sociated phenomenon are further proof that this contact — the source of which may be Professor Fischbach ’ s other dimensions — is transdimensional and important enough to cross the barriers between these states of being. The crop designs run parallel to other major signs of change on earth. Is the source a spiritual one? Are we being urged towards a new awakening in our consciousness? I believe we are being given a wake- up call and that it is our responsibility to acknowledge the message, and take ac- tion. A closing thought: I believe that all good has come from positive thinking. Our forefathers all believed in a wonderful fu- ture, and acted to make it so. A positive thought is a construct of hopeful energy sent out into the world. Like some of our friends in the indig- enous peoples who safeguard and study ancient prophecies that speak of signs of change, we, too, should observe the mul- tiple signs of change occurring around us — in our beliefs, our industries, our politics, and our environment — but especially in our fields. We should respond to our intuition. We can not afford not to. 30 chap 18.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 165"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"166 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact 30 chap 18.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 166"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"167 VI Part At the Movies 31 Part VI.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 167"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"31 Part VI.p65 2/11/03, 4:53 PM 168"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Crop Circle Movies and Documentaries / 169 Chapter 19 Crop Circle Movies and Documentaries 169 T his chapter looks at a small sampling of the many films and documenta- ries that look at paranormal phe- nomena in general, and crop circles spe- cifically.

The crop circle events I chose were all very important manifestations about which I was able to provide significant amounts of data, including reports of re- corded paranormal activity in the forma- tions. They were all very dramatic, very impressive patterns and I had a number of aerial photographs of each of them. These photographs were used to pro- mote the movie, and the studio is continu- ing to use my pictures and information in materials pertaining to the film. Touchstone/Disney also asked that I make myself available for media questions regarding crop circles, and I willingly agreed to that request. I was, in a sense, the studio ’ s “ point man ” for specific ques- tions about the phenomenon. Sometimes, questions were passed on to me from the studio; sometimes I dealt with the media people one on one. My Thoughts About the Film Signs is an exciting and scary science fiction film that uses crop circles as a plot device to advance its “ alien invasion ” storyline. I thought the script was quite clever, and I found interesting the suggestions scattered throughout the story that, for in- stance, extraterrestrials can read our minds. There is a scene in which the daughter of the farmer played by Mel Gibson says to her father, “ ETs can ’ t read our minds, can they? ” And the implication is, “ Why yes, of course, they can. ” I also liked that di- rector and writer Night Shyamalan hinted that the concept of synchronicity — the theory of the coincidence of events that seem to be meaningfully related — might not, in fact, be what we think it is. It did provide food for thought. This is interesting writing and adds to the forward movement of the story, but I do not think the movie itself does very much to further the serious study of crop circles. In essence, the crop circle phenom- enon, which I believe has already offered a great deal for mankind, and will continue to offer much more, was used solely as a device in a typical Hollywood extrava- ganza, complete with the standard “ razzmatazz ” of threatening aliens, fright- ening scenes, and expensive special effects. There was very little real insight into the phenomena, and, in a sense, the film de- based what many of us believe is the true purpose of the manifestations: spiritual en- lightenment and higher consciousness. In Signs , the crop circles are used as landing signals for an alien invasion: a negative, evil purpose. But, hey, that ’ s show business, right? I also felt that the overall sentiment of the film — and I base this not only on the script but on some of the comments made by the actors on the film — was skeptical. Some of the comments I heard gave the impression that almost everybody involved with the movie believed that all of the world ’ s crop formations were hoaxes, and that there were no paranormal events go- ing on in the fields. This was regrettable, in my opinion. Everyone involved in Signs had the opportunity to further the discus- sion of the real phenomena taking place on our planet. Shyamalan did, to his credit, leave some doors open. He did leave room for the possibility that crop circles were real, and that there might be some benefit to mankind if we try to understand them, but overall, the feeling one comes away with after viewing Signs is that crop circles are hoaxes, and that if they were real, they 32 chap 19.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 170"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Crop Circle Movies and Documentaries / 171 would likely be used for nefarious purposes.

A magnificent look at the phenom- ena and, in fact, this is the crop circle documentary that absolutely needed to be made, and which should be must-view- ing for every person involved in govern- ment at any level anywhere around the world.

The film alternates between one-on- one interviews with researchers, photog- raphers, writers, farmers, and witnesses, and stunning footage of crop formations in England, most of it in the form of aerial photog- raphy. The original music is reverential and uplift- ing, and director Gazecki wisely keeps himself out of the picture and allows his experts and the crop circles to speak for themselves. Hopefully, this will get wide airing on net- work or cable, and be readily available for rental. It really is an im- portant overview of something quite extraor- dinary and is also a truly moving and emotional viewing experience. 21.3 A Place to Stay (2002) • Feature Film • Director: Marcus Thompson • Hollywood Daze Motion Pictures • Not rated • Starring: Johnny Dallas, Amanda Ray King, Colm O ’ Maonlai, Miranda Llewellyn Jenkins, Joe Ferrera, Graham Elwell I was chief consultant on this emo- tionally powerful film set in Alton Barnes, England, and writer and director Marcus Thompson successfully communicates the lure of crop circles, interwoven with a powerful and dramatic love story. My 1991 documentary Undeniable Evi- denc e was apparently the inspiration for Thompson to create A Place to Stay , and I was greatly honored to play myself in the movie. The movie is an engaging ro- mance with X-File -type elements that will appeal to the conspiracy-minded viewer. The film is slated to debut at the 2003 Sundance Festival and then will be released to theaters.

This brief documentary (40 minutes that ran as an hour on The History Chan- nel) does a decent job of introducing the viewer to the crop circle phenomenon and covering all the myriad elements of the mystery, albeit somewhat perfunctorily. Everything seems to be here: The Barge Inn, the Princess Diana story, historical accounts of crop circles, the various theo- ries and, of course, Doug and Dave. To the producers ’ credit, though, the docu- mentary makes the argument that Doug and Dave ’ s story has a great many holes in it, and that it cannot account for the worldwide extent of the phenomenon. (One of the best lines in the piece is “ How can a worldwide phenomenon be explained by two guys and a board? ” ) The docu- mentary covers my “ 80/20 ” statement (see Chapter 18), and also, unfortunately, tries to make a connection between a single case of crop circles appearing close to a mysterious cattle mutilation (see Chapter 4.11). One of the highlights of the documen- tary is an interview with admitted crop circle “ artist ” John Lundberg who, in the end, seems to support the theory that there is a real phenomenon outside of the work of the hoaxers. All in all, a quality docu- mentary done with the attention to detail one would expect from The History Chan- nel. 21.6 Ultimate Crop Circles: Signs from Space?

This realization has impacted me greatly. There is overwhelming evidence of signs of contact. What I see, and what I have faith in, is that it was never intended that we “ believe ” in crop circles, but, instead, that they serve as a tool for us to learn more about ourselves. Moody Blues singer and crop circle enthusiast Mike Pinder recently reminded me of words he wrote some time ago, “ We are lost in a lost world. ” Now, more than ever, we need to believe in something and, most importantly, we need to believe in ourselves. Crop circles are the visual manifesta- tion of an experiment with human con- sciousness. My research and study has proven to me that we, as a species that has a powerful spiritual side to its being, do have what it takes to create a new and sus- tainable future for our planet and ourselves. Sadly, it is late in the day for this real- ization, and there are many who still do not see the truth. But we must apply ourselves to the urgent needs of our species and our planet because, frankly, we do no have a single moment to waste. Our complete disregard for the envi- ronment has already taken an enormous toll on all living things, and is easily seen on a planetwide scale. As I write this, a sunken oil tanker sits at the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Spain. If its hull rup- tures (and many experts believe it will), the oil it releases into the ocean will be double what was spilled by the Exxon Valdez . We cannot go on like this. Clearly, a change in human attitude is called for. In my view, the number of crop circles that are manmade versus those that are not, has become irrelevant. All the signs in the fields play a role in awakening mankind to the ongoing opportunity to reverse our self-destructive course and achieve true spiritual maturity. To convince the masses of the impor- tance of this quest, however, we must all do our work, and speak our message, with humility, respect, and above all, honesty. We are all in this together: research- ers, the lay public and those who make counterfeit crop circles. When the whole picture ultimately unfolds, I think it will be seen that we were all just carrying out instructions. — Colin Andrews December 1, 2002 33 Closing words.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 173"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"174 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact 33 Closing words.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 174"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"175 Appendices 34 Appendix Part Title.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 175"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"34 Appendix Part Title.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 176"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle F.A.Q. / 177 Appendix A A Crop Circle F.A.Q. 177 T he FAQ — Frequently Asked Ques- tions — file is common on the Internet these days, and is found on Websites and newsgroups that regularly have new visitors and sign up new members.

A Crop circles are geometric designs created in fields when cereal crops such as wheat, oats, oil-seed rape (canola), and corn are flattened. Originally, they were simple circular areas in vegetation in which the plants were bent over at right angles and swirled to the ground in a uniform fash- ion. In the past 13 years, more complex patterns have appeared, which include straight lines, appendages and extensions in various shapes, and repetitive geomet- ric patterns. The word “ pictogram ” is used to describe these agriglyphs. 2. Aren’t All Crop Circles Manmade? A Absolutely not. There is concrete sci- entific evidence that many crop for- mations show no sign of human creation. Be- fore 1989 and the publication of my first book, Circular Evidence (the first book written about the crop circle phenomenon), very few crop circles were manmade. As the subject of crop circles received increasing publicity over the ensuing years, the number of counterfeits in- creased dramatically. I believe very strongly, however, that the manmade factor is impor- tant and must not be ignored or cavalierly dis- missed. All activity in the fields, regardless of its source, should be fully researched. That being said, I again state with certainty that the truth would be revealed much sooner if all hoax- ing ceased immediately. 3. Where Are Most Crop Circles Found? A The majority of crop circles, both his- torically and currently, are in England, with a high concentration of formations in southern central England. Other “ hot spots ” include Germany, the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands. They have appeared in dozens of countries all over the world (see Chapter 5). 4. What Kinds of Vegetation Are Crop Circles Found in? A Crop circles are found in the whole range of cereal crops, with the vast majority found in barley and wheat. They also appear in oats and many other forms of vegetation, including canola (called oil seed rape in United Kingdom), long grass, corn, tobacco, and rice. There have been a few reports of crop circles in vegetable crops, especially spinach and potatoes. Crop formations have also been found in groves of small trees. 5. Is There a Particular Time of the Year That Crop Circles Appear? A In the northern hemisphere, crop circles appear from late April until early September This coincides with the period of the growing season when the veg- etation has grown in excess of three inches in height. 6. How Can You Tell When a Crop Circle Is Real? A These days, identifying genuine for- mations by physical inspection alone is becoming increasingly difficult, and often requires scientific equipment and testing to confirm authenticity. In the 1980s, crop circles rarely drew visi- tors, and thus, no damage was done to the site after initial discovery. It is a dif- ferent situation today. In addition to a site being compromised by tourists tramping through the fields, many for- mations that are initially thought to be genuine are, in fact, counterfeits. This is due in large part to hoaxers applying to their fakes the characteristics re- searchers recorded and reported in the early years of the phenomenon. That being said, there are certain key signature characteristics that can be looked for when trying to identify a real circle. If 35 Appendix A.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 178"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle F.A.Q. / 179 the following are found in a crop circle, the formation is probably authentic. • There are no tracks into the circle. • There are no signs of interference with the soil or the plants at points in the circle where hoaxers would have had to stand to create the formation. • The plants are not damaged. • The plants are more vibrant in ap- pearance and the root structure is more extensive than usual. • The swirl symmetry is even and there is usually two or fewer rota- tions of the spiral vein of the circle before it strikes the standing wall of the circle ’ s circumference. • There are magnetic and electrostatic anomalies in the formation, and compass rotation occurs when in- side the circle. • The plants are changed at the cellu- lar level. • Small quantities of an unknown magnetic material are found in the crop circle ’ s soil and impregnated into the plant tissue. • A magnetic profile as registered on a magnetometer mimics the actual design of the crop circle. • The profile of the electrostatic field found in a crop circle shows unusual patterning. Features that have long been associ- ated with real circles but have, in the last 20 years, been perfected by those making counterfeits include: • Very precise geometries made with- out obvious mistakes. • Well-formed cut-off lines around the circle or pattern. • The plants involved are bent over evenly during the early stages of growth. In later stages, though, the plants are broken. This “ bending but not breaking ” feature has not been successfully hoaxed in oil-seed rape (canola) plants. • Some impressive spiral veins have been reproduced. It should be kept in mind that all of these features have not been achieved with some evidence of human involvement and this is another way researchers can dis- tinguish counterfeits from the authentic formations. 7. Who Are Doug and Dave? A Doug Bower and Dave Chorley are two elderly British men who came for- ward in 1990 and laid claim to having cre- ated all the crop circles in England. These senior citizens lived in the Southampton area in Hampshire, England and their “ confes- sion ” ended up plastered on the front page of the British tabloid Today . Their story quickly made its way around the world and there are still people who credit the two men with creating the crop circle phenom- enon. When confronted with evidence proving that they had nothing to do with certain formations, they backed down and modified their claim. At one point, they claimed to have made the Celtic Cross de- sign that appears on the cover of my book, Circular Evidenc e, but could not even du- plicate it on paper when asked by myself and Pat Delgado. They then withdrew their claim to that formation. It is accepted today that Doug and Dave did make some — perhaps many — crop circles. However, it is also accepted 35 Appendix A.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 179"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"180 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact by skeptics and believers alike that it is patently impossible for them to have made all that they claimed they did. Doug and Dave did, however, deal a serious blow to the perception of the crop circle phenomenon in the mind of the gen- eral public. And there is suspicion that that is precisely what their intentions were all along. A conspiracy has not been proven, but many believe that powers with money (governmental, military, or otherwise) used Doug and Dave as part of a disinformation campaign. Dave Chorley died of cancer in the mid-1990s. Doug Bower has kept a relatively low profile in recent years. 8. Is It True That All Crop Circles Are Made by Aliens and UFOs? A There has long been suspicion that crop circles were formed by UFO landing gear, or by energy rays beamed down from an alien spacecraft onto the field. Most serious crop circle researchers allow that an extraterrestrial intelligence may be involved in the phenomenon, but the majority discount the possibility of the formations being created by alien ships. 9. Has Anyone Ever Seen a Crop Circle Form? A Yes, there have been eyewitnesses to the formation of crop circles. Cur- rently, there are approximately 50 people worldwide who have reported seeing a crop circle form in realtime as they watched. The first reports came from Argentina in 1959, and again in 1960. There were two witnesses to the 1960 event. The next credible report came from Australia in 1966, followed by several be- lievable accounts over a number of years from people in the county of Wiltshire, England. One of the British eyewitnesses was a local journalist named Arthur Shuttlewood from Warminster, Wiltshire. Shuttlewood was standing in a field near Warminster with several others late one evening when they all heard a strange sound crackling in the long grass. As they watched, the plants swayed back and forth hypnotically like a snake, and when the movement and sound ceased, they all saw that a crop circle had formed. Also, a bicycle shop owner named Ray Barnes, who lived in a small village near Warminster, watched as a line of plants bent over and swept across the field in an undu- lating wave. This line of demarcation even- tually stopped its forward movement and the plants then rotated and formed a single circle in the crops. Researcher Nancy Talbott and a col- league witnessed strange lights over a field in the Netherlands in 2001 and, shortly thereafter, a simple dumbbell pattern was discovered in the crops. Talbott ’ s colleague also claims to have witnessed a circle form in the same field during 1999. In almost every case, eyewitnesses report seeing only simple crop circles forming. 10. Have Crop Circles Ever Appeared in Exactly the Same Place? A This is a very rare occurrence but it has happened. One such place where crop circles have appeared several times is in the field below Bratton Castle in Wiltshire, England. (For more information about one such event in 1987, check out my first book, Circular Evidence.) 11. How Long Do Crop Circles Last? A Crop circles remain in the fields until the plants are harvested, or until they die naturally at the end of the growing sea- son. The crop circle “ season ” usually begins 35 Appendix A.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 180"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle F.A.Q. / 181 when the plants are approximately three inches high, in late April and May in the United Kingdom, along with other countries in the northern hemisphere. Harvest occurs during late August, early September. 12. How Large Are Crop Circles? A The smallest reported crop circle is approximately one foot in diameter, but these are very rare. The average crop circle is about 60 feet in diameter. The more elaborate designs have stretched out across the landscape over distances of three quar- ters of a mile. Among these, the 1994 for- mations at Ashbury, Berkshire; and 1996 designs at Etchilhampton, Wiltshire are the most notable. Most major designs that in- clude complex patterns are 200 to 300 feet wide. 13. What Happens to the Plants Inside Crop Circles? Are They Cut or Broken? Is It True Some Plants Are Burned? A The individual plants are bent over at right angles without being broken or cut. I have never witnessed burning of any kind in the hundreds of circles I have in- spected, but several reports of burnt plants do exist. Biophysicist William Levengood has reported finding evidence of burning inside some of the plants he has analyzed. 14. Are the Plants Always Swirled in one Particular Direction? A Until 1986, almost all the plants in crop circles were spiraled in a clock- wise direction. After circles were discov- ered with single and double rings around, the plants in the central circles were found to be swirled counterclockwise as well. (See T9 and T10 in the Andrews Catalogue on page 206.) Since 1986, the data reports about the same numbers of clockwise and coun- terclockwise circles. There are also reports of patterns in which both directions of rota- tion occur in the same circle. 15. Have “Crop” Circles Ever Been Reported in Snow? A Snow circles have been reported on a few occasions but it is not known if they represent the same phenomenon as crop circles. The most impressive snow circle was seen and photographed by students at MIT University in Boston, on the 2nd of Febru- ary in 1993. Many shapes, including circles and rings, were formed in the light snow that covered a very thin layer of ice on the Charles River. The ice was very thin and would not have been able to support even the weight of a small child, so the suspicion that the acres of geometric designs were made by the students was quickly ruled out. Snow is not that common in southern England, but on those occasions that snow has covered the usual areas where crop circles form, no designs have been reported in the snow. However, in January 1983, Mr. F. B. James witnessed something at Win- terbourne Monxton near Avebury, Wiltshire that might well be the same phe- nomena as the crop circles. One morning, Mr. James discovered several perfect, 15- foot diameter circles in young wheat plants that had been heavily covered in frost. The circles were only noticed because the frost had melted inside each circle. Interestingly, swirled crop circles have since been re- ported in this area since 1987. 35 Appendix A.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 181"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"182 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact 35 Appendix A.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 182"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle A to Z / 183 Appendix B A Crop Circle A to Z 183 Agriglyph. A word coined to describe crop circle patterns and designs. Its genesis was the word “ petroglyph, ” which is a carving or a line drawing on rock. The Greek pre- fix “ petro- ” was replaced with “ agri- ” , a variant of “ agro- ” to indicate that the draw- ings were being done in fields. The suffix “ glyph ” means “ word. ” Alton Barnes. Area in Wiltshire, England, known for its scenic splendor, archaeologi- cal sites, crop circle manifestations, and UFO sightings. Alton Barnes is within the 41.5-mile crop circle equilateral triangle in central southern England identified by Colin Andrews. The Andrews Catalogue. A catalogue of black-and-white silhouettes of hundreds of crop circle designs, both authentic and manmade. Colin Andrews continues to add designs to this massive compilation. The Catalogue , complete through the forma- tions of 2002, is reprinted in this volume. Avebury. Village built inside the world ’ s largest stone circle in Wiltshire, England, one mile north of Silbury Hill, with Stonehenge and other prehistoric archaeo- logical sites nearby. A great deal of crop circle activity occurs in Avebury and sur- rounding environs. Balls of Light. Many witnesses to crop circle formation have reported seeing balls of golden light floating and flitting above fields where, shortly thereafter, a crop circle appeared. Sometimes, the balls are reported as being silvery and metallic. Some witnesses state that the balls move with purpose and that they seemed to be read- ing their minds. These balls of light are preva- lent in the Avebury area of England. They particularly center around one hill where they are seen so often that the hill is known as “ Golden Ball Hill. ” There is no concrete evi- dence that these balls are responsible for, or in some way connected to, the creation of crop circles. However, there is a great deal of an- ecdotal evidence (as well as quite a bit of movie footage of the lights) that indicates that they are often seen in the area of crop circles. The association with crop circles is still unknown, but there does indeed seem to be some kind of nexus between the balls and the circles. Barbury Castle Tetrahedron. A massive, 12,000-square-yard crop formation that ap- peared in one night on July 16, 1991, in a field near the hill fort of Barbury Castle in Wiltshire, England. The night before its appearance, residents of the nearby village of Wroughton experienced a power black- out and many residents witnessed and re- ported flying balls of colored light above the field where the formation later mani- fested. The day after it appeared, a British newspaper ran a photo of the design with 36 Appendix B.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 183"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"184 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact the headline, “ Now Explain This One. ” The formation consisted of a triple ring in the middle with a triangle surrounding it as a perimeter, and three varied circular satel- lites extending out from the three angles of the triangle. Brain Waves. The brain wave patterns of people participating in crop circle experi- ments (including Colin Andrews himself) have registered a distinct change when the subjects enter crop circles. Celtic Cross. A Latin cross is the standard Christian cross, consisting of a vertical bar with a shorter horizontal bar two-thirds up its length. A Celtic cross is a Latin cross with a circle superimposed over its center. A crop formation described as a Celtic cross design consists of a center circle sur- rounded by four circles at each point of the compass, at the bottom, top, and side of the cross. Colin Andrews wished for a Celtic cross crop design to appear near his home, and a design did manifest shortly thereafter. A photo of this pattern appears on the cover of Colin ’ s first book, Circu- lar Evidence . Cereal Crops. Edible grass crops grown for food. The vast majority of crop circles appear in cereal crops, specifically wheat, oats, corn, oil-seed rape, buckwheat, and barley. Cerealogy. Also known as “ cereology. ” The study of crop circles. The word was coined to describe the discipline of crop circle research, much the way “ UFOlogy ” was coined to describe the study of the UFO phenomenon. Chaos Theory. The theory that within the chaos of seemingly random, unconnected events, order can be found. The “ butterfly effect ” is the most oft-cited example of chaos theory. In Ian Stewart ’ s The Math- ematics of Chaos , he explains this effect: The flapping of a single butterfly ’ s wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the at- mosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month ’ s time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn ’ t happen. Or maybe one that wasn ’ t going to happen, does. 1 Chaos theory is relevant to crop circles because when the variations in a specific model are plotted on a graph, what is known as a Koch Curve emerges; a square fractal that is known for its infinite expan- sion and diminution. Fractals are also found in many crop circle designs. Cheesefoot Head. A natural amphitheater near Hampshire, England, known for un- usual goings-on, including crop circle manifestations, odd sounds, and elusive lights. CIA. U.S. intelligence agency rumored to be interested in crop circles and the folks who study them. Colin Andrews was ap- proached by a man claiming to be a CIA agent when he lived in England, and much of what Colin was told by this man came to pass. His credibility was shattered, how- ever, by his erratic, especially “ non-agent ” behavior. The alleged “ agent ” was discredited by individuals I consulted who had knowl- edge of the standard tactics and methods used by the CIA. Most damning was this man ’ s appearance on national television, combined with his unrelenting focus on gaining access to the bank accounts into which all “ shared ” monies would be de- posited. This was obviously the behavior of a con man who tried to use my fame and reputation to capitalize on what he saw as a money-making scheme. He constantly spoke of producing a video showing UFOs 36 Appendix B.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 184"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle A to Z / 185 making crop circles, but he needed me to sell it to the media.

CPR published a newsletter for many years and is considered the preeminent crop circle research group. Circular Evidence. The first book writ- ten about the crop circle phenomenon. It was written by Colin Andrews and Pat Delgado and published in 1989. It quickly became a worldwide best-seller. Crop Circles. Circular geometries most commonly found in cereal crops. In au- thentic crop circles, the vegetation is bent over at right angles and spiraled into often complex patterns. Many crop circles around the world are hoaxes. However, there is a percentage of formations that exhibit characteristics that cannot be du- plicated by hoaxing and cannot yet be completely explained. Crop Circles: The Latest Evidence. Colin Andrews ’ s and Pat Delgado ’ s follow-up to Circular Evidence , published in 1990. Crop Rings. Simple rings that appear in fields, usually without the crops in its cen- ter being flattened. Sometimes they ap- pear as double or triple rings. The difference between crop rings and crop circles is that the plants inside crop circles are all flattened. The Cosmic Connection. Book by crop circle authority Michael Hesemann, pub- lished in Germany in 1993, and translated in England in 1996. It suggests a strong link between UFOs, extraterrestrials, and the formation of crop circles. Diatonic Ratios. The diatonic scale con- sists of the eight notes of the musical scale, without flats or sharps. The diatonic scale comprises the white keys on a piano: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. There is a specific inter- val between each note of the diatonic scale — C to D, G to A, etc. — and this dif- ference is measured by adding or subtract- ing the vibration of a particular note in kilohertz from the vibration in kilohertz of the note one step above or below. The dif- ference between the two notes is called a diatonic ratio. What does all this have to do with crop circles? Professor Gerald Hawkins dis- covered that the differences in diameters of larger and smaller circles in crop forma- tions result in a diatonic ratio (the identical ratio exists for the size differences of mul- tiple circles as for the difference between the intervals of musical notes on the dia- tonic scale). These ratios have been found in formations all over the world which are considered authentic by the experts and their existence deflates somewhat the “ all the circles are hoaxed ” theory. If all circles are hoaxed, the argument goes, and count- less circles manifest specific diatonic ra- tios, then there exists an enormous, global conspiracy to include dimensions in coun- terfeit circles that will produce these eso- teric, mathematical ratios. Dowsing. Searching for and sometimes locating underground water, minerals, un- derground mines, or buried objects by us- ing a divining rod, which is usually a forked branch or stick made of hazel wood, ash, or rowan, that bends downward when held over a source. A pendulum suspended above the ground or a map is also some- times used. Steel wire clothes hangers bent at right angles are also commonly used. Many dowsers report strong reactions from crop circles. Earth Energies. Magnetism, gravity, elec- trostatic fields, radiation, and other energy forms that are manifest in the biosystem of the earth and often associated with the ap- pearance and location of crop circles. 36 Appendix B.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 185"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"186 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact 4:15. The time Colin Andrews ’ s home alarm system triggered for many nights, until he figured out what the numbers meant (see Chapter 2.9). Fractals. A geometric pattern that is infi- nitely complex, infinitely repeating, and infinitesimal. A fractal creates shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by clas- sical geometry. Fractals are used especially in computer modeling of irregular patterns and structures in nature. Many crop circles manifest fractals, especially in “ Golden Mean ” designs, such as the Julia Set found opposite Stonehenge. Gaia Theory. The theory that the earth and all its component biological “ parts ” comprise an enormous living organism (see Chapter 4.1). Grass Circles. Circles that appear in grass, as opposed to cereal crops. Grasshopper Warbler. A bird indigenous to England that makes a high-pitched, trill- ing sound. When Colin Andrews first heard the sound of the crop circles (See Chapters 9 and 10), at least one entomologist claimed that the sound was actually that of the grasshopper warbler, ignoring the fact that the sound ’ s movement, duration, volume, and dynamic variation seemed to clearly preclude the possibility that it was being created by a bird. Not to mention the fact that the grasshopper warbler is a very rare bird and is almost always found in marshes; also the sound Colin recorded in a crop circle is 5.2 kilohertz and the warbler is 6 kilohertz. Another important fact to con- sider is that the sound has also been re- corded as radio waves, which precludes the sound coming from a bird. Healings. Some people have reported re- markable healings after visiting a crop circle. There have been claims of improve- ments to severe arthritis, reduction of trem- ors, the elimination of allergies and their attendant symptoms, and other improve- ments in health. Proponents believe that there are energy fields in crop circles that have positive effects on the human body. People have also reported improvements in psychological problems and many claim elevated spirits and new vigor after visit- ing a crop circle. Ironically, the exact op- posite effect has also been reported, with some people experiencing headaches, nau- sea, dizziness, abnormal menopausal bleed- ing, disorientation, excessive fatigue, and other negative consequences after visiting a crop circle. Hedgehogs. “ Rutting hedgehogs ” was a sarcastic explanation for crop circles coined by Gordon Creighton of the Flying Saucer Review . Creighton intended it as a put- down of the media for their often ridicu- lous explanations of the crop circle phenomenon. True to form, many in the media took Creighton seriously and “ rut- ting hedgehogs ” ended up being cited by journalists as one hypothetical cause for crop circles. Hoaxers. One or more people who enter farmers ’ fields and create crop patterns. Hoaxers produce their designs for one of two reasons: to deliberately deceive or to create “ earth art. ” Hoaxers do not usually admit their work, no matter what their real purpose. Some earth artists take credit for a creation, but most do not. Hoaxers, also known as counterfeiters, use boards and rollers to flatten crops, and many plot out their designs on computers first. Hoaxers usually damage or kill the plants in their designs. Hoaxers sometimes get permission from farmers (and pay them a stipend), many times they do not. Many serious cereologists are in agreement that hoaxers have “ muddied the waters ” of crop circle research and have skewed the perception of the phenomenon in the eyes of the gen- eral public, leading many to believe that 36 Appendix B.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 186"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle A to Z / 187 all crop circles are manmade. (See Chap- ter 2.13.) Hopi Indians. Native American indig- enous people who believe that crop circles are part of a series of earth changes that tie into an important prophecy in the guard- ianship of the Hopi Elders. Ice Circles. Circles and geometric patterns that appear on ice in designs that are very similar to crop circles found in fields. Of- ten, ice circles materialize on ice that is so thin and fragile that it wouldn ’ t be able to support the weight of a dog, let alone hoax- ers with tools to cut the ice. Institute of Resonance Therapy. Ger- man clinic that has experimented with crop circle images in ecosystem revitalization protocols. The ecosystems of today are facing unprecedented challenges to their very existence, and the survival informa- tion genetically imprinted in lifeforms does not contain viable strategies to combat the destruction, toxins, and assaults against them. IRT has been working with crop circles as remedies and has had docu- mented success. Julia Set. A massive crop formation that seemingly appeared in a period of 45 min- utes in a field across the road from the Stonehenge site. See Chapter 6 for more information on this fractal-based, spiraling crop formation. Ley Lines. Invisible lines of “ earth ener- gies, ” especially magnetism, that criss- cross the planet in a geodetic grid. Many sacred sites are aligned along ley lines, as are many crop circles. Psychics and sensitives, using faculties similar to those employed in dowsing, can “ read ” ley lines and are usually proven correct when equip- ment is used to register magnetic and other readings. Ley lines were originally recog- nized and reported by Alfred Watkins in 1921 after he noticed that an invisible straight line ran through the hilltops where ancient sacred sites were situated. M15. British intelligence agency reportedly behind the Operation Blackbird deception, which was implemented to discredit Colin Andrews and Pat Delgado and to defuse public interest in the crop circle phenomenon. Magnetism. One of the theories for the creation of crop circles. It states that a mysterious shift in the earth ’ s magnetic field produces a current that “ electrocutes ” plants and forces them to lie flat on the ground. This theory could explain why elec- tronic equipment being used in some crop circles has malfunctioned or has been de- stroyed. This theory does not explain the “ blown nodes ” factor of authentic crop circles. Some plant nodes are as big as 200 times their original size. A corollary to the magnetism theory is that the current pro- duced by shifts in the earth ’ s magnetic field combines with energies from underground aquifers, or even from water in the air, to create the “ blown nodes. ” (See Chapter 4.2.) Mandelbrot Set. The first fractal crop circle design. The Mandelbrot design was discovered by the French mathematician and chaos theorist Benoit Mandelbrot while working with a mathematical model he was experimenting with. Mandelbrot conducted his experiment at Cambridge University in England, which is very close to where a Mandelbrot crop formation ultimately appeared. Microwaves. Some crop circle research- ers suspect microwave radiation in crop formations as being responsible for feel- ings of both ill health and well-being ex- perienced by many visitors to crop circle sites. Also, biophysicist William Levengood believes that microwaves may be respon- sible for the expulsion cavities found in the plants in authentic crop circles. 36 Appendix B.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 187"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"188 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Military Helicopters. Military helicopters have often been seen flying above new crop formations and also above empty fields that later manifest a crop circle. One of the first public confirmations of military helicopter reconnaissance flights are the photos of helicopters flying over crop circles in Colin Andrews ’ s and Pat Delgado ’ s 1989 book, Circular Evidence . Mowing Devil. A mysterious figure, pos- sibly the devil himself, who appeared one night in 1678 in a ball of fire and cut a farmer ’ s crops into an oval. One of the ear- liest accounts of a crop circle forming (see Chapter 2.5). Music. After studying the crop circle pho- tos in Circular Evidence , Professor Gerald Hawkins remarked to his wife that he was looking at music. His hunch paid off after further research revealed that the ratios of size differences in crop circles were the same as the ratios of intervals between one note on the western scale and another. These diatonic ratios have been found in many authentic formations. Hawkins later refined position in his 1996 article “ The Diatonic Ratios in Crop Circles, ” which appeared in the Fall/Winter 1996/ 97 issue of the Circles Phenomenon Re- search newsletter. “ Of course we cannot say that the crop circles are ‘ musical. ’ All that can be said is that the crop circles and the eight-note musical scale are based on the same mathematical relationship. ” (See Chapter 12.) Nodes. The joint or knuckle of a plant stem. William Levengood believes that in au- thentic crop circles, the nodes of the plant stems have exploded, as though the minute amounts of water inside them was super- heated quickly and blew out the nodes. This effect is not found in plants from hoaxed formations. Sometimes, the nodes are swol- len and enlarged, but not ruptured, and the plants continue to grow. Oil-Seed Rape. A European plant ( Brassica napus ) of the mustard family, which is cultivated as fodder and for its seed that yields a valuable oil. Oil-seed rape, which is also known as canola, is one of the crops in which crop circles appear most frequently. Oliver ’ s Castle Video. A video purport- ing to show flying white balls (UFOs) creating a snowflake crop circle pattern in a field below Oliver ’ s Castle near Devizes, in Wiltshire, in England. The pattern appears in only a few seconds, and then the balls fly out of the frame. The video was eventually proven to be a hoax (see Chapter 16). Operation Blackbird. A crop circle sur- veillance operation in July 1990, coordi- nated by Colin Andrews, and funded by the BBC and Japanese television. The pur- pose of the operation was to film the for- mation of a crop circle. In actuality, it was the first known government attempt to deescalate the public interest in the grow- ing phenomenon of crop circles, and a plot was concocted to discredit Colin Andrews and devalue his work. Operation Black- bird was carried out by means of a well- orchestrated, well-funded, multilevel hoax perpetrated on Colin Andrews and the glo- bal public by the British government (see Chapter 15). Operation White Crow. One of the first crop circle surveillance operations. It took place in the “ Devil ’ s Punchbowl ” in Cheesefoot Head, Winchester, in Hamp- shire, in 1989, one year prior to Operation Blackbird. During this operation, Colin Andrews recorded the unusual trilling sound that was accompanied by physical effects on one of the team members (see Chapter 10). Petroglyphs. Lines or drawings found on rock, and believed to have been created by prehistoric man. (See Agriglyphs .) 36 Appendix B.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 188"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle A to Z / 189 Pictogram. Another word for pictograph, used when referring to crop formations. A pictorial representation of numerical data or numerical relationships, or the use of hieroglyphic symbols to communicate a message. The highly complex crop forma- tions are believed to have some type of encoded message and may be an agricul- tural hieroglyphic. Plant Analysis. A general term for the se- ries of tests performed on plants taken from crop circles. These tests include radioac- tivity measurement, spectrographic analy- sis, magnetometer readings, microscopic study, cellular crystal experiments, weigh- ing, photographing, and more. Plasma Vortex. An electrically neutral, highly ionized gas composed of ions, elec- trons, and neutral particles concentrated into a powerful whirlwind believed to be capable of, and responsible in some cases, for creating crop circles (see Chapter 4.6). Radiation. Radioactive isotopes were at one time discovered in crop circles but for some reason the military lab performing the tests stopped the research and did not issue a conclusive statement. Colin Andrews has carried a Geiger counter into crop circles with him for years and reports he has never registered anything unusual. See Chapter 3 for more on Colin ’ s research into radioactivity in crop circles. Remote Viewing. The ability to perceive people, objects, places, or events at a loca- tion removed from the “ viewer ” by either space or time. Remote viewing has been used in crop circle experiments with mixed results. Sacred Geometry. Specific patterns and ratios found in nature embodying the com- plete range of scale: from the energy sig- nature of atoms and molecules, to the spiraling arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Man has consciously applied sacred geometric ratios in everything from ar- chitecture to art, mimicking deliberately what nature achieves spontaneously, striving to create an artificial microcosm of the universe with his science and art (see Chapter 2.8). Sand Circles. Crop circle – like geometric patterns and designs that appear unbidden in expanses of desert sands. Sand circles are always presumed to be authentic mani- festations, because footprints in the sand surrounding the formations are never found, and they are often discovered in exceptionally remote areas. Secrets in the Fields. Book by crop circle authority Freddy Silva. Subtitled “ The Sci- ence and Mysticism of Crop Circles. ” SETI. The Search for Extraterrestrial In- telligence. Signs. Blockbuster 2002 Disney/Touch- stone movie written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring Mel Gibson. Signs used the appearance of crop circles on a former priest ’ s (Gibson) farm as a plot device for an alien invasion movie. Colin Andrews was a consultant on the film and was used by Disney as a media liaison, in addition to providing data and photographs. Silbury Hill. An enormous artificial mound south of Avebury in Wiltshire, En- gland that was built in 2660 B . C . with chalk and soil. It covers more than five acres and is approximately 130 feet high. We do not know why Silbury was originally built but one theory is that it, like Stonehenge, is a solar observatory. Silbury Hill is positioned on a ley line, and crop circle activity is commonplace around Silbury Hill and Avebury. Snow Circles. Circles and geometric pat- terns that appear in fresh snow in designs very similar to the crop circles found in fields. 36 Appendix B.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 189"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"190 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Sounds. A specific metallic trilling sound has been reported in crop circles. There is also often electrostatic interference with video and recording equipment when this sound is heard. Colin Andrews personally experienced this sound three times and has two tape recordings of it that he often plays for his audiences at his lectures. See Chap- ter 9 for more details on the sounds in, and of the circles . Stonehenge. A group of standing stones on Salisbury Plain in southern England that date to c. 2000 – 1800 B . C . The megaliths are enclosed by a circular ditch and em- bankment that may date to c. 2800 B . C . The arrangement of the stones suggests that Stonehenge was used as a religious center and also as an astronomical obser- vatory. There remains questions as to who designed, shaped, carried, and set up this enormous site. Many crop circle research- ers believe that the stone triptychs were placed to permanently record an authen- tic crop circle formation and, indeed, hy- pothetical designs that fill in the missing stones do look like commonly seen crop formations (see Chapter 6). Stonehenge Decoded. The seminal book on the Stonehenge site, written by re- nowned astronomer and scientist, Gerald Hawkins (see Chapter 6). Tramlines. The straight lines that run up and down the length of a field of crops that farmers use for their tractors and for walk- ing through the fields. Tramlines can be usually be seen bifurcating crop formations and many skeptics point to them as being easy access for hoaxers to create a forma- tion without leaving tracks. It is true that tramlines can do just that, but there are countless instances of crop circles appear- ing in the middle of a section of a field that is not accessible by tramlines. Tramlines run nowhere near some crop circles. A tram line is approximately six feet wide, which is the average tractor axle length. This knowledge is useful in scaling the size of crop formations from the air. Tree Circles. The phenomenon of tree circles is believed to be related to crop circle formation and may employ some of the same energies. There seem to be two types of tree circles reported. The first is when standing trees bend and move to form a geometric pattern similar to that found in the fields. These formations are only vis- ible from the air and there have been ran- dom accounts by pilots of a group of trees in a forest forming a design. The other type of tree circle reported occurs when young, still flexible trees bend to the ground and form a circular pattern, similar to the way plants flatten down to create a design. One notable account was reported by Paul Vigay, editor and publisher of Enigma . The following is an edited and abridged ver- sion of the account given to Paul: [This] happened between the years 1963 and 1969 [in] Grand Lake, New Brunswick, Canada ... .This area had long been strip mined for coal. In 1960, [a] mining company started to reforest the area...trees were planted on both sides of the road. These trees were growing on crown land, in beautiful, per- fectly straight lines. In about three years...they had grown to be quite tall, and the butts of these trees were about 3 inches in diameter. In the middle of a summer afternoon, I was in a car on my way to the lake ... .When we came...to this stand of pine trees, the road was blocked with police and army vehicles. There were...police and army personnel walking around inside the pine trees on both sides of the r oad. 36 Appendix B.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 190"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle A to Z / 191 We were motioned...to move along. While passing by, I noticed, on both sides of the road, two circles. The trees were all bent to the ground. The circles were about 10 feet away from the edge of the road, one on either side. They were fairly large, about 12 feet in diameter. The really odd thing was all the trees laid down flat to the ground [and] the tops of these trees all pointed to the circumferences of the circles. ... Talk around town was that bears had pushed the trees down. ... I knew that couldn ’ t be the answer. ... Months later, the trees were cut as close to the ground as they could. Fencing was put up to keep the curious out, [but] we could see through the fence....You could see the butts of the trees enough to see they were severely curved at ground level, [which would have been] impossible to do without breaking the trees ... .[F]or years later nothing grew there. This is not a story; this is the truth. Why would they call the army if it were only bears? Why would they fence it off? UFOs. Unidentified flying objects. UFOs have been suggested as a possible ex- planation for the formation of crop circles. One theory is that crop circles are formed by the UFO ’ s landing gear; another sug gests that UFOs create the formations from their craft using some form of laser or energy beam. UFO sightings around crop circle sites are commonplace. In Australia, crop circles were originally known as “ saucer ’ s nests ” because of the belief that UFOs were creating them when they landed. While no video documenta- tion of alien craft creating, or flying above crop circles has surfaced, there is a great deal of video footage showing unidentifi- able balls of light flying above fields where crop circles later appear or already exist (see Chapters 4.7 and 16).

Renowned Michi- gan biophysicist, who began investigating plants taken from crop circles in 1990 when Colin Andrews and Pat Delgado sent the first samples to him from England. Levengood believes that pinhead-sized holes in the plants, called “ expulsion cavi- ties, ” are caused by moisture inside the stems being heated rapidly and turning to steam. He believes this is created by micro- wave energy that happens in microsec- onds. Other of his published findings relate to elongated nodes, and also his discovery that the seeds from plants in crop circles often grow up to five times faster than control seeds, and that the seedlings can tolerate lack of water and light for a con- siderable time without apparent harm. In “ Anatomical Anomalies in Crop Forma- tion Plants, ” which appeared in the 1994 issue of the journal Physiologia Plantarum (92:356), Levengood summed up his conclusions: Crop formations consist of geo- metrically organized regions rang- ing from two to 80 meters diameter, in which the plants (primarily grain crops) are flattened in a horizon- tal position. Plants from crop for- mations display anatomical alterations which cannot be ac- counted for by assuming the for- mations are hoaxes.

In his essay “ Crop Circles: The Real and the Hoaxed, ” which appeared in the 1992 issue of the journal Weather (47:368), Dr. Meaden summed up his conclusions: We believe that the formation of real crop circles is a rare phe- nomenon resulting from the motion of a spinning mass of air which Pro- fessor Tokio Kikuchi has modelled by computer simulation and calls a nanoburst. This disturbance could involve the breakdown of an up-spinning vortex of the eddy or whirlwind type. On this theoretical model such a process leads to plain circles and ringed circles — types 37 Appendix C.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 197"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"198 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact which are known from pre-hoax times in Britain and other countries, and are the only species which credible eyewitnesses have seen forming. All other so-called crop circles reported in the media news in recent years are likely to be the result of intelligent hoaxing, while the so-called paranormal events to which Deardorff alludes are noth- ing but the consequence of poor observation and/or exaggeration by susceptible mystics and vulner- able pseudoscientists. In the ab- sence of hoaxing, the subject would still be unknown to the gen- eral public because the average number of real-circle reports per annum is small (indeed in some years it may be zero). Mitchell, Sir David. A Member of the British Parliament for northeast Hamp- shire, England. In 1990, he visited a crop circle in England with Colin Andrews and was later helpful in initiating and maintain- ing dialogue about the phenomenon with various British government departments. Morganstern, David. Director of the BBC television program Daytime Live . Andrews and Delgado made many appear- ances on this national program during the early 1990s. It was during one of these pro- grams that a man who first claimed to be a crop circle eyewitness, and then later a CIA operative, made himself known to Andrews and Delgado. Morganstern was present when the strange crop circle sound was recorded during an interview in a crop circle. M ü ller, Andreas.

Former Higher Executive Of- ficer in Department 2a of the Air Secre- tariat in the U.K. Ministry of Defense, the department which deals with UFO and crop circle reports. Pope told Colin Andrews that he believes there is a real crop circle phenomenon and that, like the 5 percent of UFO reports made to his de- partment that are believed to be extrater- restrial, similar numbers can probably be applied to the real circles. Andrews had several meetings with Pope during his time in office. Presley, Reg. Lead singer in the 1960s pop group The Troggs, and a close friend of Colin Andrews. Colin and Reg lived a few hundred yards from each other in the town of Andover, Hampshire, England. Reg has become very interested in the crop circle mystery and has visited many sites with Andrews.

Sorensen, Peter. Videographer and direc- tor who, since the mid-1990s, has made a major contribution to the archival video record of crop circles in England. The crop circle footage in the highly acclaimed video, Something Important Has Hap- pened — But You Did Not See It On The News, was shot by Sorenson. In 2000, he became convinced that many of the com- plex crop designs in England were manmade and deliberately established working relationships with several of the crop counterfeitors involved. 37 Appendix C.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 199"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"200 / Crop Circles: Signs of Contact Spignesi, Stephen J.

Wabe, John “ Weyleigh. ” British man who claimed to have captured on film images of UFOs flying very low over a field near Devizes, Wiltshire creating a “ snowflake ” crop circle design. Accord- ing to his story, he was camping out on an ancient hill fort known as Oliver ’ s Castle and was doing a “ crop watch, ” hoping to see a circle form. He began filming after seeing strange lights above the field, and he later came to Colin Andrews with his film. Andrews was, at first, intrigued, but then, suspicious. Andrews hired private detectives to in- vestigate the man and his claims and also subjected Weyleigh ’ s footage to professional analysis. It was ultimately learned that Weyleigh ’ s real name was John Wabe, that he was a video editor, and that his film was a fraud. There are still many who believe that the Oliver ’ s Castle video could not have been hoaxed and that it does, indeed, show UFOs cre- ating a crop formation, even though Wabe later confessed to the hoax. 37 Appendix C.p65 2/11/03, 4:54 PM 200"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"A Crop Circle Who’s Who / 201 White, John.
