It is wherewe attempt to go back to the beginning of something; a state of 'focusedopenness' where our preconceptions, and everything we think we already knowabout something, are temporarily set aside. It is often used when we feel wehave reached a plateau of thought or come up against a brick wall and need tolook at something anew. It is to become (for a while) timeless in our thinking,to unburden ourselves of our fixedness, our presumptions, even our prejudices,in the hope of finding fresh perspective or insight.The subject of crop circles is difficult to raise in polite company these dayswithout the obligatory joke about it all being a hoax. All the beauty, poetryand grace that they exhibit simply pass many people by, unnoticed, unrealized –an unreality. It seems that the subject has become something of a culturalembarrassment, especially to the English, who still can't quite believe thatthey once fell for an obvious confidence trick by two men who wanted to fool theworld into thinking that ET was talking to us. For the embarrassed, the cropcircles remain to this day hermetically sealed behind a wall of rejection, notto be examined lest anyone be fooled again.But, while many have walled themselves off from crop circles, the circlesthemselves have quietly and consistently continued to appear. In fact, since theheady days of 1990 and the height of their fame, they have progressively becomemore and more sophisticated and complex. Around fifty to sixty circles appeareach summer in the UK alone (sometimes significantly more), with many moreoccurring worldwide – most notably in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway andItaly, as well as the USA and Canada; all regularly report the phenomena duringtheir summer months.Crop circles vary in size, from a few feet across to over a thousand feet ineither diameter or length. In the UK, the average diameter is about 200 feet,hardly an insignificant size. These incredible works of geometric art are nosmall undertaking; nothing about them is casual, slapdash or unintelligent,quite the contrary, their designs are often incredibly clever and inventive.On design alone, the crop circles of the past twenty years or so deserve asecond look, as so much of what they symbolize is intelligent, significant andeven pertinent to our world. The crop patterns might even be considered, on somelevel, powerfully transformative and instructive.This book is about those designs and what they embody, the meaning that liesbeneath the shapes and the perennial knowledge they seem to employ. It is abouttheir variety and diversity and, paradoxically, their unity of language andultimately their universality. A foray into the world of the crop circles can beedifying and even enlightening. It is a journey worth making the time to take.But, how might we begin to break this cultural taboo, shake off enough of thebaggage the crop circles can bring with them and begin to separate the wheatfrom the chaff? Perhaps we need to find that state of focused openness that Zencalls Beginner's Mind.It is my pleasure to welcome you to a new updated edition of this book. It isgratifying to know that crop circles are continuing to enchant and fascinatereaders all over the globe. Since the first edition in 2006, crop circles havecontinued along their inexorable path, to a destination we cannot yet see orfathom.They draw to them artists, writers, philosophers and free-thinkers from aroundthe world. In an age when we have sacrificed much of the richness of humanexperience and perception in favour of the stark authority of science, one cansee why crop circles have become icons of consciousness evolution and a rallyingpoint for change. Many believe that we are currently living through the deaththroes of one world-age and the birth pains of a new era. That crop circles havebecome symbolic of this process is a fascinating phenomenon in itself and shouldalso be a source of great comfort and hope for the future.[images/Fig-5.jpg] EVERYTHING AND NOTHINGSCIENCE AND HOAXINGFrom their very inception, the crop circles have steadfastly resisted ourattempts to fit them into our current world-view. They have tantalized but sofar eluded science and despite the claims of hoaxers and rationalists, they haverefused to be completely explained away as an elaborate deception. At present,crop circles remain one of the most stubborn challenges to our view of whatconstitutes our reality because although they are there for us to experience,they do not fit in comfortably with our understanding of the world.The public profile of the circles appears cyclical, seeming to rise and fall inwaves. Every now and again, there will be a crop circle of such complexity ormagnitude that it will tweak the public interest, but for every peak there is acorresponding trough, as new hoaxers and detractors come along to counter anyresurgence of interest.For all the hostility, it has to be said that the crop circles do not seem tocare about what is said about them. They have continued their revelationsundisturbed and undeterred throughout the years. Even in 2001, when much of thefarm land in the UK was declared off limits due to the outbreak of foot andmouth disease, they continued to appear as usual. Government restrictions mayhave placed them out of reach to ground researchers, but they could still berecorded photographically from the air – seen and understood, their forms drawnand contemplated.The vast majority of circles appear fully formed overnight, in the space of sixor seven hours (sometimes less) during the summer months. Most arepicture-perfect with no mistakes, even though formations are often hundreds offeet in diameter and created in the dark. If crop is flattened manually, thereis no lifting it up again to cover a mistake.Crop circles, it seems, have a life and agenda of their own and there issomething about the doggedness of their persistence that, if nothing else,deserves our respectful attention. It is as if these giant expressions are borneof some imperative; a need to convey or illustrate something vitally important.This apparent compulsion becomes simultaneously more eloquent and more profoundwith each passing season.To date, the work of biophysicist William Levengood forms the most comprehensiveand credible scientific study of the subject. He has a background in researchfor the agricultural seed industry and so is well placed to investigate whatmight be happening. Levengood has detected some unusual characteristics inconnection with both the soil and crops of the circles. He has found definite,demonstrable changes, which he insists are not accountable for by hoaxing alone.These changes occur at molecular and cellular levels and include specificchanges to the nodal points of wheat and barley stems, which are seen to bend orrupture from the inside outwards. Whilst Levengood does not go as far as tospeculate on the ultimate origin of such changes, he does believe that microwaveenergy may be involved, which superheats the crops for a fraction of a second,affecting the moisture content and causing the plants to soften and fall over,cooling in a horizontal position. This superheating also accounts for the nodalrupturing (these are called 'expulsion cavities') and the general bending of thenodes – the parts of the plants that store moisture. Furthermore, testing showsthat this heat energy (as evidenced by the varying extents of changes observedin the sampled plants) conforms to known patterns of energy distribution, suchas Beers Law. The soil samples collected also show unusual changes. Crystallineformations and even microscopic nodules (or 'spherules') of meteoritic iron,have been found and photographed – perhaps suggestive of a strange atmosphericeffect at work. A number of papers by Levengood have appeared in peer-reviewedscientific journals that deal specifically with plant physiology, indicatingthat his work is well-regarded and has some independent scientific credibility.[images/Fig-6.jpg]The crop circles seem to teeter precariously between scientific fact on the onehand and the realm of the hoax-artists on the other. Although two or three ofthem might be faked for the press each year, the vast majority of circles gounclaimed. It is interesting (and rather depressing) that in the fifteen or soyears since the first hoax was reported, the media have never tired of wheelingout the same well-worn story every summer. Such stunts claim by inference thatthe whole phenomenon is a joke – a claim that ignores the science. I have oftenwondered if the hoax theorists have fully considered the science, or have simplydiscounted it because, for them, it can't be true.A stalemate has been reached between the assertions made by scientificinvestigation and the idea that all circles are a hoax. Neither one can whollyaccount for the phenomenon; neither one can claim to have the argument entirelysewn up. This leaves the crop circles occupying a strange position, in whichtheir origins cannot be wholly proved or disproved.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE THIRD PLACEA CHANGE IN EMPHASIS AND PERCEPTIONGeometrically and symbolically, the crop circles make a great deal of sense tomany people. They appear to speak in a universal language of metaphor, allegoryand myth; their patterns are full of significance and meaning that is hard toignore. Taken as a body of work, these gigantic symbols and mandalas seem toexpress something very deep about the nature of the world, and suggest a meansof looking at reality in an entirely new way.Such has been the nature of the perpetual search for the circles' validation,that these less tangible elements have been largely ignored. We live in a worldthat finds worth only in those things that one can prove to be real; if there isno proof we tend to discount or dismiss things. The occurrence of crop circleshas made this approach rather difficult, so with no end to the science–hoaxstalemate in sight, we either choose to suspend all further work indefinitely orwe have to transcend the argument altogether.The interesting thing is that when you do loosen the tether on this dyadic stateof affairs, you find that the symbolism and geometry of the circles is, in fact,a third way of probing their nature. No obstacle is put in your way, save thelimits of your own imagination; the crop patterns are open-ended statementswhich you are free to explore at will.Once this change in emphasis is engaged (from 'who' and 'how', to 'what' do theymean) the circles suddenly and magically unfold before your eyes. If it was notso bizarre, one might be forgiven for thinking that this is exactly what theywant us to look at – not how they are made, or by whom – but what they might besaying.[images/Fig-7.jpg]After over fifteen years of following the crop circles closely, investigatingand experiencing hundreds of them in person, I can honestly say that I do notknow who makes them all or how – and I don't even know exactly why. But what Ican tell you is that I have come to believe through their symbolism, geometryand metaphor that the crop circles represent or make visible some of the oldestand deepest questions man has ever asked. They appear as mirrors; pictures ofour state of mind or of our aspirations, dreams and even, at times, our doubtsand fears. To gaze at the circles is to gaze upon the mystery of mankind.From the beginning, crop circles have presented us with shape, geometry andnumber: it is their very essence. Take, for instance, the circle (the shape thatfirst appeared in the crops): it has no beginning or end; it encompasses moreinterior space than any other shape; and its circumference is unknowable as itcannot be accurately measured, which is why we have to use 'pi' (π) in order toapproximate it. The mysterious and solitary nature of the circle has made itsynonymous with divinity down the ages. It is loaded with symbolism, signifyinga meaning beyond its functional form. It embodies a whole set of philosophicalnotions that can be derived from its properties; the 'qualities' of the circle.The unfolding of number and order (shape) tells us something fundamental aboutour reality. It reveals how matter is ordered by creation and, more than that,it tells us that this process is as meaningful as it is functional. The cropcircles have consistently presented us with patterns that not only illustratethis process but also offer a commentary upon it.These are not new ideas. Major civilizations have all, to a certain degree, beenaware of and utilized such concepts. Plato's Utopia, the philosophy ofPythagoras and even St John's vision of the Kingdom of Heaven all embraced thesame notions; these concepts have inspired and motivated man for thousands ofyears.With the development of modern science, our perception of the world andourselves changed. Science rendered such ideas unnecessary for the comprehensionof our reality. However, the innate meaning of number and form is neitherarbitrary nor superstitious; it is derived from the very nature of those numbersand shapes.Number and form lie at the foundation of everything. They are the orderingprinciple behind the way matter is structured, from the tiniest particles to manhimself. These shapes may even form the structure of one of the most mysteriouscreations in the known universe: consciousness.Crop circles are challenging our grasp of reality as well as our current notionsabout the nature of life and creation. They seem to be re-tuning our perception,rebalancing the issues of function and meaning.Once seen, the innate meaning imbued in the structure of all things does changeone's view of reality. It breathes life into what seems lifeless and it givesmeaning beyond purpose. The crop circles have changed the lives of many; theyhave started a silent revolution in thinking, one that 'en-souls' the worldrather than rendering it a living machine or computer program.Crop circles not only speak of elemental shapes and numbers but they alsopresent themes and illustrate the archetypal principles that underpin them.Labyrinths, mazes, knots, ropes, tethers, spirals, all become part of a symboliclanguage that lies at the heart of the human psyche.Those who perceive these things embodied in the crop circles and subsequentlybecome aware of them in the wider world, will never see eye to eye again withthose who do not. For those who only regard them as a prank or scientificcuriosity, the circles do not tally with their reality constructs. Each side nowinhabits a different reality; one side lives in the rational, logical andliteral world, whilst the other lives in a reality in every way the same butdeepened by symbol, metaphor and intrinsic meaning.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LANDSCAPESTONE CIRCLES, EARTHEN MOUNDS AND FAIRY RINGSIt does not matter in which country the crop circles appear, they have adefinite affinity with ancient sites. As you look through this book, you willnotice the recurrence of many of the UK's famous henges and barrows. In the US,circles have appeared around Serpent Mound, a site sacred to the Native Americantribespeople. Continental Europe also has many large megalithic (meaning 'bigstones') sites in France, Germany and beyond.Dowsers find the crop circles of particular interest; they detect all kinds of'dowsable' energies in and around them. Sometimes the circles occur on ley lines(straight lines of energy that connect features of the landscape), which dowserssay criss-cross the whole earth; occasionally they happen at the centre of agroup of old churches or above underground water systems. One piece of modernresearch showed that the circles favour underground aquifers and chalk. Thosewho investigate 'earth energies' speculate that underground water and chalk mayemit some kind of piezoelectrical energy, which can generate strange atmosphericlights and may be connected to the appearance of the crop circles.In the UK, there are many myths and legends that surround prehistoric sites.However, we are also beginning to realize how sophisticated our ancientancestors were; their use of geometry and measure in the creation of stonecircles and barrows is far more advanced than first thought. It is obvious thatmany of the sites are connected to astronomy. Understanding the heavens was veryimportant to early man. Not only was it useful to be able to predict thechanging seasons, there is much evidence to suggest that the ancients also tookan interest in the movement of the sun, moon and stars, and especially rare,celestial events such as eclipses of the sun and the moon.[images/Fig-8.jpg]STONEHENGEStonehenge is the world's most famous stone circle. Surprisingly, it is notparticularly large in area but the upright sarsen stones enclosing the centralspace are enormous (up to 22 feet in height). What distinguishes the design ofStonehenge from that of Avebury is the way huge lintels are used to connect theupright stones. Stonehenge is said to date back to 3100 BC, but recentdiscoveries suggest it may be much older.[images/Fig-9.jpg]AVEBURY STONE CIRCLEThere are two stone circles at Avebury, both enclosed within one larger one,which also has a huge stone avenue leading into the south side. Over the lastthousand years, most of Avebury's stones were torn down for use as buildingmaterials in the village that now stands inside the circle. The stones wereoriginally brought from the Marlborough Downs, where sarsens are to be foundscattered in the wake of an ancient glacier. The sarsens used to build thecentre of Stonehenge are from the very same place. Avebury dates from around2500 BC.SILBURY HILLSilbury Hill, near Avebury, is the largest neolithic mound in Europe (130 feet)and is thought to have been built in three stages, starting about 2660 BC. Underthe earthen cover, there is a six-stepped conical structure built in alternatelayers of earth and chalk. It was probably a vast communal undertaking thatcreated the ceremonial centre. Silbury Hill has been likened to the breast orthe pregnant belly of the Earth Goddess; it also has been described as an'Orgone Accumulator' – a device for the collection of natural earth energies.[images/Fig-10.jpg]In the UK, the huge stone circle complex at Avebury in Wiltshire is a focus forcrop circles; almost every year they appear in the fields surrounding the site.Avebury is the largest stone circle on the planet – many times larger thanStonehenge. Whilst Stonehenge has seen many crop circles over the years and itsstones are bigger than those at Avebury, it is Avebury that attracts more cropcircles. Stonehenge was undoubtedly an astronomical observatory, its stones markthe cycles of the sun and the moon and could be used to predict eclipses.Avebury, on the other hand, is connected only to lunar cycles, linking it to theNeolithic cult of the Earth Goddess – who was also associated with the moon.Ancient locations throughout the world are steeped in myth and folklore. The UKsites are often reported to be haunted not only by ghosts but also by earthspirits, pixies and fairies; the ancient god Pan is also a regular visitor.There are many stories of those who have come into contact with the Small Folk,dancing in fairy rings around barrows and stones. Before the days of alienabductions, people were frequently reported to have been carried off by fairiesand spirits.Any visit to a quiet, isolated barrow or standing stone can be an eerieexperience. In many myths and legends these monuments are described as placeswhere the veil between this world and that of the spirits has worn thin,providing a gateway for spirits to cross over into our realm.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LUMINOSITIESTHE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER REALITIESDuring the summer of 1990, Steve Alexander travelled to Wiltshire in order tovisit and film the crop circles. From the top of Milk Hill he looked down intothe fields below and began filming a circle to the left of his vantage point. Hehad finished and was about to leave when suddenly a small flash of light drewhis attention. It was travelling through the air from left to right in his fieldof vision; picking up his camera, he started to record its progress. Theluminosity appeared as a small point or sphere of light and it moved from thedirection of the crop circle he had been filming towards another, which wasobscured from view by the bottom of the hill. The light passed over the wheat asit neared Steve's position, it then paused before dropping into the crop andmoving around; it caused no disturbance in the standing wheat at all. For ashort while, it ceased moving and Steve stopped the camera. However, iteventually resurfaced and went off with increasing speed across the field, awayfrom the camera. Once more, Steve set about filming the event. The light thenpassed over the roof of a tractor that was turning a field; the tractor was seento stop for a short time before resuming its task. Finally, the light travelledon and up towards the summit of Rybury Camp, an ancient hillfort in thedistance. The camera attempted to follow the light up into the air but it waslost to the viewfinder. Throughout the duration of the film, Steve and hiscompanion can be heard discussing possible explanations for what they arewitnessing. They suggest a balloon, a bird, or a piece of paper, but neitherseems convinced that they have hit upon the answer.Steve's footage was the first to show this form of luminosity and its possibleconnection with the crop circles. Since that time, and with the growing numberof video/camcorders available on the market, there have been more suchrecordings; sequences showing what appear to be small, brilliant white lightsflying in proximity to the circles. When the tractor driver in Steve's film wastraced, he described the light as being the size of a beach-ball, glinting andflashing. The driver was at a loss to explain why his tractor had stopped; theengine had simply cut out briefly before spontaneously restarting.The most striking property of these luminosities is the nearer they come to thecamera the smaller they get, whilst the further away they travel the larger theyseem. Eye witnesses report that the lights are roughly spherical and range fromthe size of a tennis ball to that of a small beach-ball. In another sequence,the object is almost stationary but it flares several times before making arapid arcing (or looping) manoeuvre into the crop. The brilliance of the objectdazzles the eye like burning magnesium but the crop remains unharmed. The motionis fascinating and can be attributed entirely to the light, since the camera wasmounted on a tripod. In yet another sequence, the lights are seen to travel overa circle, just above the heads of visitors, before increasing to an incrediblespeed and disappearing into the distance.[images/Fig-11.jpg]When Steve Alexander's film footage was submitted for analysis in Japan, thetechnicians concluded that the object had no discernible dimension, and that insome frames the object was clearly present whereas in other frames it simplydisappeared. They ruled out a conventional explanation for the light, such as abird, insect or balloon, and said the object appeared to fade in and out ofreality.These lights seem to appear and disappear at will, but where do they appear fromand disappear to? It is a question that UFO researchers have been asking foryears. But I wonder if the Japanese researchers were closer to the truth thanthey imagined when they suggested that the ball of light seemed to fade in andout of reality.So much about the crop circles seems aimed at challenging our view of reality;even the geometry of some formations can be seen focusing upon the convergenceof two states of existence. Throughout this book, we will encounter crop circleshapes that employ such concepts as the Golden Section and the squaring of thecircle; both of which symbolically address the bordering of realms. The squaringof the circle is representative of the meeting of heaven and earth or that ofthe spiritual and the physical, whereas the Golden Section speaks of the meetingbetween matter and the animating force that instigates growth, development andlife – to many this is also a meeting of substance and spirit.The scientific work carried out on the circles may also be suggestive of suchand idea. The effects to the crop and soil seem to be almost alchemical innature. The effects of circles upon the crop and soil seem to be almostalchemical in nature. Scientific analysis can reveal that crops have beenaffected but is at a loss to explain exactly how it came about. This parallelsscientific analysis of alchemical matter. It is interesting to observe thatalchemists insist some of the changes to their chosen elements occur as a resultof the consciousness of the alchemist himself – another example of the meetingof matter and spirit.A challenge to our accepted view of reality seems instilled in the crop circlesat every level. It is an infinitely iterated concept which doggedly insists thatwe reconsider the bounds of what we currently call reality."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONESACRED GEOMETRY AND NUMBERPAINTING BY NUMBERSIt would be stating the obvious to say that in order to understand somethingabout the crop circles we have to look at their geometry and number. The essenceof the crop circles is their shape, measure, pattern and proportion – it istheir very structure and language.However, to enter this world is not just to learn something about the shapes ofthe circles; an inadvertent but fortuitous by-product is that we also begin tolearn something about the underlying patterns of life, nature and the universebeyond. The geometry of the crop circles seems to express timeless, universalconstants and elements found throughout the natural world, in everything fromthe tiniest flower to vast star-filled galaxies, and even in the design of ourown human bodies. Number is often referred to as the 'universal language' andcan be understood by anyone who can count.Geometry means 'measure of the earth', and its practice is hoary with age. Theneed to quantify or measure area is an essential part of human culture; thedemarcations of property and land boundaries are the first acts in the creationof any society. Man has observed for thousands of years the shapes, patterns andproportions which underlie the design of the natural world. The geometry of atree or a flower is as demonstrable today as it was long ago, as are the ratiosand proportions of the human body and its growth processes; geometry, it couldbe argued, is the world's oldest science.However, to the Ancients, geometry and number were more than quantities andscientific functions; they embodied a canon of number, form and proportion thatwas used to build the whole of creation. These numbers, forms and proportionswere therefore divinely inspired, the building blocks and apparatus of a divinecreator. The Ancients took these principles and wove them into the fabric oftheir societies; they used them in their temples and precincts and reproducedthe same divine order in their own sanctuaries and metropolises. In his theoryof The Forms, Plato wrote about an archetypal canon of number, shape andproportion upon which creation was founded. These 'forms' existed in a perfectstate beyond the physical world and were known to us only by inference – or viapure reason.Another legendary Greek, Pythagoras, founded a whole philosophy of numbers basednot just upon their quantities and forms, but also on the archetypal qualitiesthat numbers can be seen to embody. Pythagoras was almost certainly not thefirst to associate numbers with these kinds of qualities, but it is from himthat most of our modern understanding of such matters originates. The study ofsacred geometry follows a symbolic creation myth, which uses geometric forms todescribe the unfolding of order in space. Included in this myth are not only thenumeric and geometric properties of numbers, but also their inherent meaningsand functions (the second property of number). Once the basic vocabulary of thisgeometrical and numerical language has been grasped, it opens the door to awhole new realm of understanding shapes and patterns.Shapes, patterns and proportions also play an integral role in the human psyche;it has been suggested that we are predisposed to see underlying patterns in allthings. Certainly it has been shown that shapes, spaces and designs can have aprofound unconscious effect on the mind – we may even have some kind of'intelligence of shape and harmony'. Just as with Rorschach ink blots used inpsychological profiling, we have an ability to detect order and form in theseemingly haphazard. It is this skill in part which helps us make sense of thethings we see, sense and feel. Perhaps we feel a special empathy with certainarchetypal shapes, because we are designed using the same principles andsomewhere deep inside us we sense this. Through psychology, we have become evermore aware of our patterns of behaviour and even our relationships can belikened to proportions and ratios – we often give them a form of measure bysaying that some are closer and some are more distant.[images/Fig-12.jpg]Cherhill, Wiltshire, England. July 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetCrop circle designs are often about economy, efficiency and expediency. Like thebest designs in nature, the measures and proportions are often self-contained,and whilst seemingly multifaceted and beautiful, they employ the most ingeniousand simple solutions for achieving the desired outcome. The patterns often useself-similarity, mirroring and regeneration at varying scales, and other suchprinciples found in nature's design book. Themes develop over a season or more,beginning with simple forms which are then developed through several formationsand brought to a conclusion. This is a fascinating part of the crop circlemystery, and one which allows us to follow the thought-processes of themysterious circle-makers.Once seen, these patterns, or universal truths, cannot be unseen: once we knowsomething, we cannot then decide to 'unknow' it. Perhaps that is what the cropcircles are intended for. Perhaps this also goes some way towards helping usunderstand why the crop circles can have such a life-changing effect: once seen,the geometrical aspect of the crop circles can change the way people perceivereality forever.The following chapter will take you through the numbers one to thirteen and lookat their properties, symbolic meanings and the crop circles that have utilizedand expressed them. ONE: UNITY AND ETERNITYMONAD – THE CIRCLEThere is no other shape more pleasing than that of the circle, a continuouscurve around a single point. A circle has no beginning and no end; it is theonly shape that can be drawn in a single movement, a single sweep of the pencilaround a compass point. It represents the eternal, wholeness, unity andperfection. For sacred geometers the circle represents the Divine, all that is,the one potentiality from which all else emanates.'God is a circle whose centre is everywhere and whose perimeter is nowhere' – sosaid Voltaire using the circle as a metaphor for the omnipresence of God'sbeing. God is often shown as a geometer in many classical paintings,illustrating that many artists have considered geometry a sacred science,whereby they followed in the footsteps of God by also using this sacred canon ofnumber in their own creations – a canon of shape and proportion that permeatesboth the Earth and the Heavens.Another unique and mysterious property of the circle is that, unlike any othergeometrical shape, the sum of its perimeter is unknowable (who knows the truemeasure of the Divine?). We therefore approximate the perimeter (orcircumference) of a circle by using the equation Circumference =2 π r, where ris the radius. Pi (π) is a mathematical device called an 'irrational number',used to create the illusion of an equilibrium of numerical values; in otherwords, it is used to approximate a number that is inexpressible in whole units.Pi = 3.142; a number whose decimal places would stretch into infinity, neverfinding a resolution. So, for our convenience, it is shortened to just threedecimal places, ensuring a satisfactory solution to estimating the circumferenceof any given circle.[images/Fig-13.jpg]Morgan's Hill, Wiltshire, England. August 2003. Wheat crop, approximately 80feetIn his theory of The Forms, Plato postulated that when we draw a shape we mayonly ever approximate a universal form, one that exists in a state of perfectionbeyond our physical realm. That archetypal shape exists, like the Divine, in astate of flawlessness that we can only ever aspire to. In the case of thecircle, this is quite true; we can all imagine a perfect circle, but in thisphysical reality we may never truly replicate it, or ever know its true measure.In rendering a circle as faithfully as we are able, we take part in a sacred actwhich pays homage to the perfection of the Divine.AVEBURY HENGE, 1998The simple ring at Avebury had a notable curiosity – it seemed to have furthergeometries implied in the laid crop. Several arch-shapes can clearly be seen,but appear to serve no practical function.[images/Fig-14.jpg]Avebury Henge, Wiltshire, England. August 1998. Wheat crop, approximately 300feetEXPRESSIONS OF ONE-NESSThe simple circle is the ultimate expression of one-ness. The very term 'cropcircle' is derived from the fact that the phenomenon began as single, simplecircles appearing in crop fields. One-ness is also expressed as an encompassingring, sets of rings, or as a single, solitary formation. Often, more complexgeometries are contained within an enclosing circle or outer ring, and this canprovide a vital clue to hidden proportions beyond those overtly expressed by thepattern. Inside these formations, the laid crop often indicates a centre ofswirl different from the geometric centre of the circle, although why thishappens is unknown.COLLINGBOURNE KINGSTON, 2005The lovely set of concentric rings appeared in the stunning blue-purple of aborage field. The harmony of measure between the standing and flattened areas isquite beautiful. Borage is used in the production of several medicines, and thiswas the first time a circle had appeared in this type of crop.[images/Fig-15.jpg]Collingbourne Kingston, Wiltshire, England. August 2005. Borage crop,approximately 200 feetTHE RIDGEWAY, 2005The magnificent Ridgeway rings – nearly two hundred feet across – illustratedthat simple is not always boring. To be inside this formation was like standingon the top of a huge vinyl record – walking around the circle, following thedirection of the laid crop, I had the eerie feeling that I was the needletraversing the grooves, and found myself wondering exactly what kind of musicthis amazing record would play.[images/Fig-17.jpg]The Ridgeway, Wiltshire, England. July 2005. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetTHE CIRCLE AND THE POINTBefore a circle can be drawn, a point has to be established around which thecircle can be constructed. Although for our own purposes we may mark that pointwith a pencil, in reality, the point has no dimension and is known only byinference. The point is the timeless, still centre around which all of creationis formed. The compass should be swung around in one continuous movement, tosymbolize the fact that the circle represents unity and one-ness. Ideally, thebeginning and end of the circle should not be visible, as a circle has neitherbeginning nor end, it is eternal. The construction of the circle is thebeginnning point of the sacred geometry journey.[images/Fig-16.jpg]BECKHAMPTON, 2003Another variation on the theme of nested rings appeared at Beckhampton in 2003.Notice the incredibly narrow line that marks the perimeter of this circle; itwas barely a foot's width. A fine line of flattened crop stems was found insideand most people simply could not walk within the line for fear of damaging thisincredibly delicate feature. A similarly fine line is to be found close to thecentre of the circle. Another feature of this beautiful formation is the tinycircle just outside the perimeter of the outer ring; it was barely two feetacross, and beautifully swirled. The only way to access the individual rings ofthe formation was via the tractor lines in the field, without which it wouldhave been impossible to walk around inside this formation without damaging thedesign.[images/Fig-18.jpg]Beckhampton, Wiltshire, England. July 2003. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feet TWO: THE DIVISION OF UNITYDYAD – THE VESICA PISCISLike the splitting of the atom or the Big Bang, the second act of sacredgeometry splits apart that which was whole and perfect, in order to bringcreation into being. For if there is only unity and wholeness, there can neverbe diversity and variety. Amidst this primordial schism, the 'one' begins todivide; like the first division of the human egg, a self-similar circle isbrought into being and the 'one' becomes 'two'.On the geometer's drawing board, the point of the compass is placed on theperimeter of the original circle. Keeping the compass open at the samedimension, a second circle of equal size is transcribed, the perimeter of whichruns directly through the centre (or crosses the heart) of the first circle. Theoperation complete, it can now be seen that an almond shape has been created bythe two interlocking circles. This almond shape is traditionally known as thevesica piscis meaning 'fish bladder' and it is this opening from whence all therest of creation will be birthed. However, as a consequence of this archetypalrupture, all oppositions now come into being: Light and Dark, Order and Chaos,and of course, in conjunction with the dawn of the concept of Good, its twinEvil is born.ASHBURY, 1996The vesica was first overtly depicted by the crop circle phenomenon in 1996. Thewonderful formation at Ashbury allowed one to stand inside the almond-shapedspace, from which geometers believe all of creation is birthed. A lovely circleexisted at the formation's centre, created only by the lay of the crop, subtlyindicating the centre of the design.[images/Fig-19.jpg]Ashbury, Oxford, England. July 1996. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feet[images/Fig-20.jpg]The interior of AshburyEXPRESSIONS OF TWO-NESSThe vesica piscis (below) is the archetypal expression of two-ness, as this ishow geometers depict the splitting of one into two. However, two-ness can beexpressed in many other ways.A line is drawn between the two sides of the vesica. The line is also a productof two-ness as it signifies two points and joins them together.[images/Fig-21.jpg]HOBSON, 2000This double formation at Hobson is yet another way of expressing two-ness – twoformations which appear in the same field on the same night. There have beenseveral instances of this over the years – some larger and more complex thanthis pair.[images/Fig-22.jpg]Hobson, Wiltshire, England. July 2000. Wheat crop approximately 200 feetMARDEN, 2005The stunning formation at Marden was another variation on the vesica theme. Thistime, only the central almond-shape is portrayed; the two circles which createdit are invisible. Inside, a wonderful eighteen-point lotus-like flower appearfour rows of eighteen petals (ever decreasing in size), giving an overall countof seventy-two petals.[images/Fig-23.jpg]Marden, Wiltshire, England. August 2005. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetFURZE HILL AND FYFIELD DOWN, 1998Another important expression of two-ness is that of the twin, or 'twinning'.During 1998, two formations appeared that were clearly related to one another:they were essentially the same size, and each was an inversion of the other.These 'cats-eye' formations appeared in two different crops (wheat and barley),giving a further difference of texture to each formation. Twinning can take twoforms, identical and non-identical twins. This pair were clearly non-identical,whereas the pair of dolphins (here [chapter_006.html#page_118]) are of theidentical variety.[images/Fig-24.jpg]Furze Hill, Wiltshire, England. June 1998. Wheat crop, approximately 150 feet[images/Fig-25.jpg]Fyfield Down, Wiltshire, England. June 1998. Barley crop, approximately 150 feet THREE: TRINITYTRIAD – THE TRIANGLEThree is the product of one and two (1 + 2 = 3). The role of three is,unsurprisingly, three-fold. Three simultaneously pierces, balances and thentranscends polarity.The numbers one, two and three are themselves seen as a group, with threesignifying the completion of this first phase of creation. The equilateraltriangle is the form that breaks through the vesica created by its archetypalparents and opens up the birth channel for other numbers to follow.'I am the One that is Two, that is Three'; this lovely phrase describes how thefirst three numbers are considered to be a unity themselves. The ChristianTrinity – God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit – is an expressionof the tri-fold nature of God and another example of the inherent trinity inunity.Three restores a sense of balance to our sacred numbers. Three resolves thetension of the dyad (opposites), by creating a pattern of 'beginning, middle andend'. The appearance of unity is restored, but of course it is now three-foldrather than a single unity.The process of transition from two to three is very important to us as humanbeings. Often we seek to resolve tension and conflict within ourselves and, ifwe are successful, we say we have been able to change ourselves. What is crucialfor a change of this nature to occur is an ability to see things from adifferent perspective, or in balanced proportion; this ultimately is what breaksthe endless dyad of conflict. However, we don't suddenly become a totallydifferent person – we are essentially the same, but simultaneously also a littledifferent.We could say that we have been able to restore our inner unity and resolve ourconflict, by finding a different (third) perspective on things.Another example of the principle of three-ness is found in the court room, wherewe have the opposing councils of prosecutor and defence, and the judge who sitsbetween them (often in a triangular arrangement).This example also illustrates how the introduction of a third element naturallyprovides a place for perspective. The triangle provides a third point from whichboth sides of the dyad can be seen in perfect proportion.Finally, the arrival of three is also the first act of evolution. Evolutiontranscends what has come before to manifest something that is at root the samebut also simultaneously different and new. Often when we have resolved a part ofour inner conflict we feel renewed, and might feel we are a better person for it– this is personal evolution.[images/Fig-26.jpg]The triangle is born from within the vesica. Using the line that connects thetwo sides of the vesica together, connect each end of that line to the apex ofthe vesica. This creates an equilateral triangle.LIDDINGTON CASTLE, 2001This formation uses three interlocking circles (or crescents) enclosed within acircle, to create a tri-fold unity. At the centre of the formation, a triangleis created with convex sides. Patterns akin to this have been used in the'trefoil' design of church windows for centuries, representing the trinity, ortri-fold nature of God.[images/Fig-27.jpg]Liddington Castle, Wiltshire, England. June 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 200feetEXPRESSIONS OF THREE – NESSThree-ness can be expressed either as a three-fold unity – as threeinterconnecting rings, or perhaps as three circles contained by an outer ring –or as an entirely new shape, the equilateral triangle, whose three sides andthree angles are all in perfect proportion.BERWICK BASSETT, 2001This magnificent formation in a field of young, emerald-coloured barley was aplay on something called 'curves of pursuit'. Each successive convex triangle,whilst receding in size, simutaneously rotates several degrees, creating curveswhich seem eternally to pursue each other.[images/Fig-28.jpg]Berwick Bassett, Wiltshire, England. June 2001. Barley crop, approximately 200feetAVEBURY TRUSLOE, 1998This stunning formation is one of only two to have appeared solely as a truetriangle shape. The design is nicely finished off with three tiny circles at theapex of each point. Interestingly, the crop is all laid in one direction, ratherthan swirled in the more familiar circular pattern.[images/Fig-29.jpg]Avebury Trusloe, Wiltshire, England. August 1998.

Itcontained three groups of three different-shaped petals – as if reinforcing itsvery three-ness.[images/Fig-31.jpg]Picked Hill, Wiltshire, England. July 2000. Barley crop, approximately 180 feetBROAD HINTON, 2003This crop formation was based on the famous 'Flower of Life' design, veneratedfor many years. Essentially, the Flower of Life is a set of interlockingcircles, which are said to contain all the geometrical designs used in creation.Here, the interlocking pattern has been selectively used to fill in the centralspace of this triangular formation.[images/Fig-32.jpg]Broad Hinton, Wiltshire, England. July 2003. Wheat crop, approximately 150 feetLOCKERIDGE, 2000A three-armed propeller-type design, this crop circle combines the circle, thetriangle and three narrow almond-shaped arms. This formation appeared on anaturally sloping field and was visible to anyone and everyone driving by.[images/Fig-33.jpg]Lockeridge, Wiltshire, England. July 2000. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetWINTERBOURNE BASSETT, 1997This is an all-time classic crop formation. The striking harlequin-like designis highlighted by the fantastic green of the young barley in which it appeared.Taken the morning on which this formation first appeared, the photographcaptures the way the early morning sun reflects like quicksilver on the freshlylaid crop.[images/Fig-34.jpg]Winterbourne Bassett, Wiltshire, England. June 1997. Barley crop, approximately200 feetGIANT'S GRAVE, 2000Another arrangement of three circles, bound together by a fourth – thisformation was interesting because two of the arms are identical but the third isslightly different – yet another expression of three-ness.[images/Fig-35.jpg]Giant's Grave, Oare, Wiltshire, England. August 2000. Wheat crop, approximately200 feetWEST TISTED, 2000West Tisted is, without doubt, one of the most beautiful three-fold formationsto date. An undulating necklace of small, round wheat pearls, locked in place bya narrow ring.[images/Fig-36.jpg]West Tisted, Hampshire, England. July 2000. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feet FOUR: THE FOUR PILLARS OF MATERIAL REALITYTETRAD – THE SQUARE AND CUBEWith four we move away from the archetypal and perfected realm, to begin thecreation of material reality as we know it. With the arrival of four, depth andvolume are brought into being; in other words, our three-dimensional realitybecomes possible.The shape of four is the square (or the cube). Both the square and the cubeexhibit stability, equality and strength, all attributes of four-ness. Four isalso the number that will give physical form to everything that now comes intobeing; physical matter is the necessary protective clothing for everything thatwill exist in the new material realm. Four represents matter, substance andmass, the primary building blocks of the universe, and also the four classicalelements, Earth, Air, Fire and Water.Carl Jung, the renowned psychoanalyst, postulated that our inner self wasquadratic in form: he called it the 'quaternity of the self'– thinking, feeling,sensing and intuition. The act of dividing the square into four quarters isalmost instinctual. Mandalas (often considered visual representations of theinner self) are also often quadratic in form.With the birth of four, we also find ourselves back at square one. To theAncient Greeks, four was the first true number; with four we are beginning a newphase, hence the relationship between one and four.However, there is also another more mystical connection between one and four,which has been used by temple and church builders for thousands of years, and itis known as the 'Squaring of the Circle'.The crop circles have used squares, cubes and creations of four-ness to producesome beautiful formations.[images/Fig-37.jpg]A circle is drawn which fits exactly the dimension of the centre of the vesica.Using both the original line across the width of the vesica and a further linejoining the two apexes of the vesica as a guide, a square can be drawn insidethe circle. The birth of the square also ushers in the third dimension, thepoint, width, height and breadth.LURKELEY HILL, 2005A personal favourite, this lovely formation combines classical four-foldgeometry – the division of the circle by the four cardinal points – with that ofthe vesica. Eight vesica shapes (two groups of four) guide the positioning ofthe smaller circles that are not involved in marking the quadrants of thedesign. This formation combines the numbers, two, four, eight and twelve.[images/Fig-38.jpg]Lurkeley Hill, Wiltshire, England. June 2005. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetMONKTON DOWN, 2005Circles also play a central role in this design to form a square shape.Twenty-five circles of equal diameter are nestled together like a group of poolor snooker balls. Four of the balls seem to be missing, or are of a differentcolour or texture, creating yet another cross-shape.[images/Fig-39.jpg]Monkton Down, Wiltshire, England. June 2005. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetHONEY STREET, 1999Another cube-shaped formation at Honey Street appeared during the summer of1999. On this occasion the cube also had a sphere suspended within it.[images/Fig-40.jpg]Honey Street, Wiltshire, England. July 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetALLINGTON DOWN, 1999The birth of four-ness ushers in the third dimension and the cube, and therehave been several cuboid patterns to appear as crop circles. This stunningexample at Allington Down recalled the work of the artist M. C. Esher, famousfor his use of shapes to create optical illusions, and the ingenious repeatedtiling of patterns and shapes in the creation of larger unrelated designs.[images/Fig-41.jpg]Allington Down, Wiltshire, England.

Wheat crop, approximately 200feet[images/Fig-42.jpg]Inside Allington DownMARDEN, 2005 AND EVERLEIGH ASHES, 2000Although the Celtic cross (or quintuplet) has five dots, it is in fact anarchetypal expression of four-ness, as its geometry is four-fold. Many designsof this type have appeared throughout the years, but these two examples are ofparticular note. At Everleigh Ashes, the central circle was replaced by atumulus (an ancient burial mound), whilst at Marden the centre circle was filledwith exquisite knots and leaves.[images/Fig-43.jpg]Marden, Wiltshire, England.

Wheat crop, approximately 200feetETCHILHAMPTON, 1997The 'grid' formations were yet another expression of four-ness. The grid atEtchilhampton was in fact one of two formations to appear in that field on thesame night. Another six-armed spinner design had appeared close by, and the twowere undoubtedly a pair. This formation was found to be 26 squares one side by30 squares on the other. It was speculated that if the 26 squares representedweeks, they would represent a half year period. If we multiply the 30 squares by0.5 years, we get 15 years. The formation appeared in 1997, adding our 15 yearstakes us to 2012 – the end of the Ancient Mayan calendar! So this formationcould be a calendrical grid.[images/Fig-47.jpg]Etchilhampton, Wiltshire, England. August 1997. Wheat crop, approximately 175feet[images/Fig-46.jpg]EtchilhamptonEAST KENNETT, 2000Another stunning grid–type formation appeared close to the chambered long barrowat West Kennett. This time the square grid was also further split into foursections, by alternating the sizes of the small squares and oblongs whichcomprised the grid area. This formation, like its Etchilhampton counterpart, wasutterly incomprehensible from the ground. Whilst crop circles are oftenlabyrinthine and temple-like on the ground, they are undoubtedly meant to beviewed from the air. Interestingly, in both these formations the interiorgrid-workings were unconsciously forbidding to the visitor; almost all walkedaround the giant squares, unwilling to penetrate the intricate inner design.[images/Fig-48.jpg][images/Fig-49.jpg]East Kennett, Wiltshire, England. July 2000. Wheat crop, approximately 300 feet FIVE: THE MYSTERY OF LIFEPENTAD – THE PENTAGON AND PENTAGRAMFive is perhaps one of the most mysterious and misunderstood of numbers and ithas a myriad of properties. Four has created material reality and the world,matter, substance and mass. With the birth of five, the mysterious gift of lifeis breathed into that world.It has often been called the Quintessence, meaning 'fifth-being'. It is thatmysterious something that animates matter to life, without which creation wouldbe barren – five brings meaning into the world, through life. Five is a numberthat resonates powerfully with us. Five-fold geometry governs the human form – ahead, two arms and two legs. We also have five fingers on each hand and fivetoes on each foot. However, five is not just found throughout the human body, itis found throughout the natural world, most prevalently in living forms.The shapes of five-ness are the pentagon and the pentagram. The pentagon hasfive equal sides and angles, whilst the pentagram is a five-pointed star. Thepentagram has a somewhat chequered history, and is often associated withwitchcraft and the dark arts. Reverse a pentagram and many see a symbolresembling a two-horned devil – this is unfortunate, and makes the pentagram amost misunderstood and sometimes taboo shape.The true nature of the pentagram is to do with the mystery of the greatest ofall gifts – life. It is also about the propagation of life. The pentagram hassome extraordinary regenerative properties. Many progressively smaller pentagramstars can be fitted inside a larger one – regeneration through self-symmetry orself-similarity is an important property of all life on the planet. It gives thepentagram star almost fractal-like abilities; fractals are shapes that mimicnatural systems and are generated through self-similarity (see here[chapter_009.html#page_144]).The pentagram star also generates one of the most mysterious and importantgeometrical proportions, the Golden Section, also known as the Divine Proportion(see here [chapter_002.html#page_84]). It is also the generator of the famousFibonacci Sequence, a series of numbers that is found in living systemsthroughout nature, in which each successive number is the sum of the precedingtwo. Using this sequence, Fibonacci showed that nature used a principle ofgeneration-from-within in order to propagate living forms.The Golden Section/Fibonacci Sequence can also be found in the form of theGolden Spiral. The crop circles have used the pentagram star, the Golden Sectionand the Golden Spiral in their designs, making manifest in the crop fields thevery secrets of life.[images/Fig-50.jpg]The birth of the pentagram from within the vesica is a slightly more complicatedproposition than the triangle or the square. It uses both the line that connectsthe two sides of the vesica and the circle which fits exactly inside. It thentakes a further nine steps to create the pentagram within the circle using acompass.BISHOPS CANNINGS, 1997The arrival of this magical star heralded the beginning of a series offive-pointed stars (pentagrams) over the next season or so. The first pentagramhad been at Bythorn in Cambridgeshire in 1993, but it had not appeared againuntil this formation in 1997. This crop circle was beautifully constructed withcookie-cutter precision and was striking when viewed from the air. Its simple,clean lines left no room for doubt that exploration of five-ness had begun inearnest.[images/Fig-51.jpg]Bishops Cannings, Wiltshire, England. July 1997. Wheat crop, approximately 200feet[images/Fig-52.jpg]Bishops CanningsAVEBURY TRUSLOE, 19981998 saw a whole series of pentagram star crop circles. The first of the yearwas this lovely pentagram enclosed within a ten-petalled flower. Note the waythe crop is flattened between each arm of the star, creating a wonderful effectfrom the air of shade and light. There is something mirror-like about the waythe sunlight reflects from the interior of some of these formations – as thoughthey are suspended on a pool of quicksilver or gold.[images/Fig-54.jpg][images/Fig-53.jpg]Avebury Trusloe, Wiltshire, England. June 1998. Wheat crop, approximately 200feetDADFORD, 1998As the summer of 1998 unfolded, the pentagram formations began to evolve. Thisformation occurred close to the famous F1 motor racing track at Silverstone –home of the British Grand Prix. This time we were given two interlockingpentagram stars instead of the familiar single star. Accompanying them werethree tiny and curious glyphs. One is clearly an Egyptian ankh; the other twoare less distinct, although there was much speculation about the centre glyphbeing reminiscent of Ganesha the Hindu elephant deity.[images/Fig-55.jpg][images/Fig-56.jpg]Dadford, Buckinghamshire, England. July 1998. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetBECKHAMPTON, 1998Yet another pentagram formation appeared towards the end of the 1998 season.Once again two interlocking pentagram stars feature. However, this time the topstar is smaller than the lower one. Both are locked together by a pentagon shapeand enclosed within a containing circle – a beautiful expression of five-ness.[images/Fig-57.jpg]Beckhampton, Wiltshire, England. August 1998. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetGREEN STREET, AVEBURY, 2003As an expression of five-ness there can be no bettering the formation at GreenStreet: an outer pentagon, with interior pentagrams, the iteration of five-nessis all-pervading. There are some other lovely numbers at play in this formation– seven pentagram stars in total, giving this formation an ineffable quality,and in addition to the two pentagons (one containing the stars, the otherenclosing the whole design) an overall number of nine is achieved, which is anumber of completion and conclusion. Through the geometry and numbers encoded inthe crop circles we can discern the nuances and subtleties in the design, andglimpse their inner meanings. Numbers have qualities as well as quantities.[images/Fig-58.jpg]Green Street, Avebury, Wiltshire, England. July 2003. Wheat crop, approximately350 feetBARBURY CASTLE, 1997Although often obvious, crop circle geometry also has a hidden side. Thisbeautiful collection of six moons around a central circle and ring might quitelegitimately be interpreted as having the properties of six-ness. However,whilst this is quite true, it also has a hidden (or esoteric) five-fold geometryas shown in the diagram below, drawn by crop circle researcher and geometerMichael Glickman.[images/Fig-60.jpg][images/Fig-61.jpg][images/Fig-59.jpg]Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England. April 1997. Oilseed rape (canola) crop,approximately 200 feet SIX: ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCYHEXAD – THE HEXAGON AND HEXAGRAMWith four having created the elemental world, and five animating those elements,six is about the organization and utilization of those elements and livingforms. With the introduction of six come the important tenets of economy andefficiency. The shapes of six-ness are the hexagon and the hexagram.In modern society, economy and efficiency can be bywords for meanness and cost-,corner-, or job- cutting, but in the natural world, getting the most fromprecious natural resources is essential and therefore underpins the design andstructure of many of nature's forms.In a world where resources are finite, ensuring optimal yield (efficiency) fromall materials also ensures the greatest longevity of those resources andultimately of the living systems they support. Economy and efficiency of thiskind are about more, rather than less – they are about the continuing long-termsurvival of life and the environment that supports it. We could learn much fromobserving and learning from the economy and efficiency of form in nature.The structure of the honeycomb nicely illustrates this philosophy at work.Hexagons lock together perfectly so that there is no space between them; thismeans that as a group of storage compartments, the hexagons provide the largestpossible capacity, whilst using the least amount of materials and labour. Whenhexagon shapes are built into a structure they share external faces, making thebuilding process extremely efficient. The hexagon shape brings a furtherproperty to the structure, and that is strength: the regularity of the shapebrings stability and strength to structures which contain it.The strength of six-ness is perhaps best demonstrated by the changing of waterinto ice. As water molecules cool, they tighten into hexagonal patterns wherethey form the basis for six-sided snowflakes. The colder the molecules becomethe more they bond together. The six-fold symmetry of the molecular bonds helpsto make ice an extremely strong and hard substance.Crop circles have explored six-ness in many different ways, but it isinteresting to note that whilst there have been many six-fold formations, andmany hexagon shapes, for some reason hexagrams have seldom been seen.[images/Fig-62.jpg]In contrast to the pentagram, the creation of a hexagon is much simpler. Threecircles of equal size are drawn together (as shown) and the connections betweenthe three define the points needed to create a perfect hexagram shape.WARMINSTER, 1997This massive hexagonal formation appeared below Clay Hill, a location synonymouswith UFO sightings in the 1970s. A wonderful view could be had of this formationby climbing up the hill and looking down into the field below. A standinghexagon shape is enclosed within a containing circle. The central star-likeshape has twelve points, each with three lines emanating towards the perimeterof the designcircle. Many likened this design to the spokes of a bicycle wheel.[images/Fig-63.jpg][images/Fig-64.jpg]Warminster, Wiltshire, England. July 1997. Wheat crop, approximately 300 feetWINDMILL HILL, 2005The marvellous hexagon at Windmill Hill explored the relationship between thetriangle and the hexagon. Interestingly, the design contains thirty-sixequilateral triangles (twenty-four outlined triangles and twelve smallerstanding triangles: 24 + 12 = 36). Six is the square root of thirty six, whichis the number of sides in a hexagon.[images/Fig-65.jpg]Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England. June 2005.

Barley crop, approximately 200 feetALL CANNINGS, 2000The All Cannings flower is another inventive expression of six-ness and, as weprogress through the numbers, it becomes possible to see how much interplaybetween shapes and numbers can be at work within a single formation.

However, stones of this type are more commonly referred to as 'dolmens'.The formation that appeared alongside the stones was a rare six-pointed star.The night it appeared, there was a power failure in the nearby village; thisformation also had strange electrical and magnetic properties that affectedmobile phones and cameras – but only whilst inside the circle.[images/Fig-72.jpg][images/Fig-73.jpg]Devil's Den, Wiltshire, England. July 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 250 feet SEVEN: THE MYSTERIOUS FEMININEHEPTAD – THE HEPTAGON AND HEPTAGRAMSJust when we think all is structured according to best economy, efficiency andorder, we come face to face with the mysterious and beautiful number seven – thenumber of the colours in the rainbow, the notes of the musical scale and, ofcourse, the seven deadly sins. However, seven is often considered a luckynumber.Of all the numbers from one to ten, seven is the only number that will notdivide equally into the 360° of the circle (the monad) and the only number thatcannot be born from the vesica. The division of a circle into seven partsproduces an 'irrational number' (a number whose decimal places would stretchinto infinity without ever finding a whole number resolution), and it is theseparticular properties that give seven its association with the feminine and,more specifically, the mysterious virginal feminine.Perhaps in an unintentional play on words, the 'irrational' of 'irrationalnumber' links us with this ancient view of the feminine principle. The femininewas synonymous with the irrational, the unconscious, with dreams, intuitions andthe deep waters of the emotional self.The unconscious is the root of that archetypal chaotic and unpredictableelement, without which diversity, variety and evolution could not exist. Toomuch order leads to sterility and stagnation; a little chaos is absolutelynecessary in order to precipitate change. Just as man needs woman in order topropagate the human race, order needs a little chaos to generate a continuingunfolding creation. Order is needed to balance and harmonize, chaos is needed tounbalance and de-harmonize – without it the world would be sterile and lifeless.However, seven is a 'whole' of sorts: as already noted, it governs the notes ofthe musical scale, the colours of the rainbow (or colours of refracted light),and the number of major chakras (subtle energy centres in the body). Because ofits connection with such numinous phenomena (music, light and subtle energy)seven is the number of spirit.There have been a series of seven-fold (or seven-element) formations over theyears. They occupy a special place in crop circle history, often as mysteriousas the number which governs their form.[images/Fig-74.jpg]THE BIRTH OF SEVENSeven is the only number (from one to ten) that cannot be divided equally intothe 360° of the circle. The Heptagon is born from outside the vesica, above theapex of the almond shape (see above).Greek mythology tells us that Athene (Goddess of seven-ness) was born from theforehead of Zeus, who had swallowed his lover Metis whole. Zeus subsequentlydeveloped a terrible headache, his head was split open and Athene emerged, fullygrown.DANEBURY RING, 1998This lovely formation was the first true seven-fold formation to appear. Thereis something about the design which suggests an anti-clockwise spin and gives aslightly disharmonious edge to the image. This could be taken as a visual clueas to its unusual sevenfold geometry.[images/Fig-75.jpg]Danebury Ring, Hampshire, England. July 1998. Wheat crop, approximately 150 feet[images/Fig-76.jpg]Unlike the pentagram (five) or the hexagram (six), once we reach seven, two starpatterns become possible. The stars are created by connecting every two cornersand every three corners of the heptagon respectively.EAST FIELD, 19981998 was also the year of seven, with three seven-fold formations appearing. Thebeautiful green of the young barley crop and the shadows and highlights createdby the lay of the crop gave this shape an almost organic feel.On the morning of its appearance, the lines and tiny outer circles were perfect,but over the course of the day and overnight a wind and rain storm damaged thedelicate perimeter design (as seen in the picture below). The centre was abeautifully woven knot of crop. This formation holds the record for the largestexpanse of flattened crop – 1.6 acres.[images/Fig-78.jpg]East Field, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England. July 1998. Barley crop,approximately 300 feet[images/Fig-79.jpg]At the centre of East Field was a carefully woven knot of crop[images/Fig-80.jpg]TAWSMEAD COPSE, 1998One of the final circles of 1998 was the wonderful seven-fold design at TawsmeadCopse. Upon entering this formation we noticed, just within its perimeter, aneat row of walking shoes and trainers: people had felt the need to remove theirshoes before walking around any further. This was a fascinating automaticresponse to this crop circle and expresses succinctly the unique atmospherethese spaces can unconsciously provoke within the individual. The floor lay ofthis circle was exquisite, truly like flowing water; one almost had the sense ofmovement sitting amongst the fallen wheat. This formation was undeniablytemple-like in its effect upon the psyche and many sat with us in a quiet kindof reverence to watch the sunset.[images/Fig-81.jpg][images/Fig-82.jpg]Tawsmead Copse, Wiltshire, England. August 1998. Wheat crop, approximately 350feetROUNDWAY, 1999The most fantastic seven-fold design to date has to be the 'Roundway Splash'.This incredible double seven-pointed star, with circles upon each point, was anextraordinary space to experience. The formation measured approximately 300-350feet in diameter and once again, contained an incredible volume of flattenedcrop. It certainly supports the thought that 'big circles = big power' – thelargest formations certainly convey a sense of magnificence and sheer power.[images/Fig-83.jpg]Roundway, Wiltshire, England. July 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 350 feetHERN AIRPORT, 2001Never was there a better photo opportunity for a crop circle. Located at the endof the runway at Hern Airport was this strange little seven-fold pattern, formedin the ripening yellow of an oilseed rape (canola) field.[images/Fig-84.jpg]Hern Airport, Dorset, England. May 2001. Oilseed rape (canola) crop,approximately 150 feet EIGHT: RESONANCE AND HARMONICSOCTAD – THE OCTAGON AND OCTOGRAMHaving established the seven notes of the musical scale, the introduction ofeight would signify the sounding of the octave. With the octave (oct-ave), wehave the birth of resonance and harmonics.It would be useful to think of crop circle designs as harmonic and resonant inthe musical sense. Often they combine the geometry of different numbers tocreate beautiful synergies; frozen symphonies of shape and number.When we play a musical scale on the piano, we play A, B, C, D E, F, G – theseven notes of the musical scale. However, to start the next scale, we find weare playing another A. This A is called the octave. This second A issimultaneously the same as the original A, but it also different - it isseparated by pitch.What makes the octave so important is that it is the end of something, and yetalso the beginning of something else. When we play the musical scale, it doesnot sound complete to only play the seven notes – we have to sound the octavefor it to sound complete. But the octave is also the beginning note of a newscale, so the octave is the natural ending of one scale and at the same time thenatural beginning of a new one.This notion of a simultaneous end and beginning is important one in nature andgeometry, it is the principle that underlies periodicity in cycles of life andrenewal and is the prime principle of eight-ness.Eight is often seen as a number of renewal or periodicity; the number thatsignifies the end of one thing and the beginning of another; a change from onestate to another. Eight can be interpreted as being resonant of the division ofunity: cell mitosis is an eight-stage process, whereby one cell divides andbecomes two.Eight is also seen as a lunar number, with the phases of the moon beingtraditionally split into eight: Full Moon, Waxing Gibbous, First Quarter, WaxingCrescent, New Moon, Waning Crescent, Last Quarter, Waning Gibbous – and back toFull Moon. This lunar aspect reveals a hidden association between seven andeight: there are approximately seven days between each quarter lunar phase,making the lunar month approximately 28 days.Resonance also plays a large part in human interaction. We speak of being drawnto friends and colleagues because they share something in common with us; wefeel they are on our wavelength. In other words, we find them resonant toourselves; we are naturally drawn to people who are like us in some way, itmakes us feel comfortable and in harmony with others in the human race.Eight has been explored in crop circle design many times, but most often as anoctogram (an eight-pointed star) rather than an octagon.[images/Fig-85.jpg]EXPRESSION OF EIGHT – NESSThe octogram can be viewed as an intersection of two squares, and this has beenseen in a good few circle designs. However, eight-ness has also been expressedin a number of other ways – as an eight-fold division of the circle, and even asan unfolded octogram. The crop circle at Lane End Down (below) is a lovelyexample of an eight-fold mandala-like pattern, of which there have been several.The diagram above shows the geometry necessary for the creation of an octagon.[images/Fig-86.jpg]Lane End Down, Hampshire, England. July 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 120 feetBISHOPS CANNINGS, 2000The eight-fold design at Bishops Cannings is a classic octogram; note the doublesquare shape. This is an interesting photograph because this formation containeda slight imperfection when it first appeared. Most other photographers waiteduntil after the first day to record the formation, at which point theimperfection had disappeared.[images/Fig-87.jpg]Bishops Cannings, Wiltshire, England. June 2000. Wheat crop, approximately 200feetCHEESEFOOT HEAD, 1995This magnificent eight-fold design appeared in the famous Punchbowl in Hampshire(a natural amphitheatre). Many early circles occurred in this remarkablelocation, but the land is no longer farmed and is now used to host an annualmusic festival. This formation was quickly nicknamed 'The Jellyfish', and is oneof a small group of formations to have appeared in an oat crop.[images/Fig-88.jpg]The Punchbowl, Cheesefoot Head, Hampshire. July 1995. Oat crop, approximately300 feetWEST OVERTON, 1999To some, the formation at West Overton was a Space Station, but to others it wasundoubtedly an unfolded octahedron. If you draw up this design and cut it out,you can fold it into the octahedron shape. The octahedron is an object witheight equilateral triangle sides. It is one of the five Platonic Solids –regular solids that have equal sides and identical faces. This is the only timea shape has been depicted in such a way.[images/Fig-89.jpg]West Overton, Wiltshire, England. June 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 250 feetHUISH, 2001This wonderful web-like pattern has circles which are placed at eight equalintervals around its perimeter, but has thirty-three circles all together.[images/Fig-90.jpg]Huish, Wiltshire, England. August 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetOGBOURNE ST GEORGE, 2003The magnificent formation at Ogbourne St George was situated in another naturalamphitheatre. Whilst this design has only six arms it is unquestionably based oneight-fold geometry – two of the arms seem to have been omitted.[images/Fig-91.jpg][images/Fig-92.jpg]Ogbourne St. George, Wiltshire, England. June 2003. Wheat crop, approximately400 feet NINE: SUBLIME THRESHOLDENNEAD – THE NONAGON AND ENNEAGRAMIf the creation of human life begins with the division of the egg, and afternine months of gestation, the human infant crosses the threshold of the womb andis born into this material world then in many ways, the human life iswonderfully resonant of the geometric principles through which we have nowjourneyed.The number nine marks a sublime threshold over which we all cross when we enterthis life as a newborn – a brand new potentiality, and simultaneously thehighest expression of life on our planet.Nine is the threshold of numbers and also the culmination of all previousnumbers. After nine we travel beyond the decad, onto an entirely new level. Tenis not the last number, rather it the first of a whole new world order.As with the number seven, it is impossible to draw a perfectly equal nine-sidedshape (called a nonagon), or a nine-pointed star (an enneagram), using only thegeometer's tools of compass and straight edge, although close approximations arepossible. However, unlike seven, nine will divide into the 360° of the circle togive nine divisions of 40°, so with the aid of a protractor to measure angles,the problem does become solvable.These peculiar properties give nine its dualistic character and are symbolic ofits role as a conduit between this material world and other more mysteriousstates of existence.In modern times, the enneagram has manifested itself as a psychological tool forthe exploration of the psyche. The enneagram contains nine 'passions', ororganizing principles of the personality: Perfectionist, Giver, Performer,Romantic, Observer, Questioner, Epicure, Boss and Mediator. They are used tocharacterize parts of the self, which may be dominant or even suppressed.Identifying enneagram types can be used to examine interpersonal relationshipsand as a tool for understanding oneself and others.There have been very few nine-fold formations over the years, but those therehave been are beautiful, enchanting and inspiring – just like the nine muses ofthe ancient world.CHERHILL, 1999The beautiful Cherhill nine-fold spinner is another all-time classic cropcircle. Nine equilateral triangles and six narrow crescents are combined tocreate a design of exquisite harmony and proportion.[images/Fig-94.jpg][images/Fig-93.jpg]Cherhill, Wiltshire, England. July 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetEXPRESSIONS OF NINENine-fold formations are on the whole quite rare. When we reach nine, there arethree enneagram stars possible and there is often something quite spectacularabout them. Nine, like seven and eleven, always seems to evoke the ineffablewhen used in design, or in the creation of architectural space. Nine is noteasily born from the vesica, and yet is the number most associated with birth.[images/Fig-95.jpg]ALDBOURNE, 1999This formation at Aldbourne was a more traditional nine-pointed star. Itoccurred during an appalling spell of wet weather and days passed before anaerial record could be made. Since the circle appeared in young barley, the cropbegan to recover, making the design barely visible. This interesting exampleillustrates how little crop circles damage the crop in which they appear.[images/Fig-98.jpg]Aldbourne, Wiltshire, England. June 1999. Barley crop, approximately 400 feetALL CANNINGS, 2001The field at All Cannings is close to the Kennett and Avon canal, a major arterythat runs through the Pewsey Vale, the location of so many crop circle sites.This truly beautiful formation is another classic enneagram, perfectly executed.Although a perfect enneagram is impossible to draw, there seems to be no problemwith reproducing one here!Notice the wonderful swirls between each point of the star. Each was unique –various knots and standing twirls of wheat. The centre was a very lovely swirlcreated by the twisting and splaying of a central tuft of wheat.Visiting this formation was an absolute pleasure; the atmosphere of the spaceleft a distinct spiritual impression upon the mind.[images/Fig-100.jpg][images/Fig-101.jpg][images/Fig-99.jpg]All Cannings, Wiltshire, England. August 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 175feetWOODBOROUGH HILL, 2001This formation appeared below Woodborough Hill, a central landmark rising up outof the Pewsey Vale, close to where the Kennett and Avon canal passes by. Thisamazing circle with its rotational division into nine, had circles lockedbetween arching arms. The crop in which it appeared was long-eared wheat, whichhas spiny bracts on the seed-heads, and is a lesser-grown crop in the UK.[images/Fig-103.jpg][images/Fig-102.jpg]Woodborough Hill, Wiltshire, England. August 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 200feet TEN AND ELEVEN: TRANSCENDING THE DECAD (PART 1)DECAGON: DECAGRAM AND HENDECAGON: HENDECAGRAMIf nine was the culmination of number, the sublime threshold, then ten is thevessel which contains all previous numbers and transports them to a new level,beyond the decad.As we reach this number, the word 'decad', whilst meaning ten, is also a wordfor the numbers from one to ten as a whole. This tells us something important;ten is both a number in its own right, and also a collection of numbers; inother words, ten is a new whole. Ten, therefore, is like the monad (one) – butat a different level.Ten forms the basis of our decimal system, and is also the number of digits onour two hands – fingers and thumbs are very useful when learning to count. Everytime we multiply by ten we add a zero, signifying a greater number or level ofnumber. To reach ten is to transcend all that has gone before and reach a newlevel. Ten-fold geometry is found throughout nature – crabs and lobsters bothhave ten legs, and citrus fruits often have ten segments.The first number beyond ten, eleven is yet another that cannot be equallydivided to create an equal-sided shape – and approximations have to suffice.Eleven is a very mysterious number, often associated with consciousness and theexpansion of consciousness beyond the everyday world. It is the first in what isknown as the 'master sequence' of numbers, which unfolds like the eleven timestable, 11, 22, 33 and so on.Eleven is the number which signifies access to other dimensions and governsvisionary and mystical states of mind. However, eleven is also mercurial innature and is also said to be linked with delusion and duplicity.Eleven is not commonly found in the natural world; it is like those visionarystates with which it is associated – elusive and mystical. Like Plato's theoryof The Forms, eleven exists only in an ideal state beyond the physical world.[images/Fig-104.jpg]Once we get to a ten-sided shape, seven decagram stars become possible.MARTINSELL HILL, 2000This wonderful lotus-like mandala uses ten circles of equal size to define itsperimeter, and contains five beautifully-shaped teardrops or petals. The use often in any pattern seems to give it a sense of balance and wholeness. The lotusis symbolic of the unfolding of the spirit, and with divine order. Ten is thenew unity which holds all the numbers of the decad (from one to nine) and indoing so, takes them onto a new level of function and meaning.[images/Fig-105.jpg]Martinsell Hill, Wiltshire, England. August 2000. Wheat crop, approximately 200feet[images/Fig-106.jpg]AVEBURY HENGE, 1994Universally known as the 'Avebury Web', this amazing formation was the grandfinale of the 1994 crop circle season. The circle is divided into ten equalparts to create the web-like design, with four further horizontal dividers ineach section to link the whole pattern together. Interestingly, the centres forthe outer circles, which define the undulating pattern of the web, are locatedbeyond the perimeter of the formation itself.[images/Fig-108.jpg][images/Fig-107.jpg]Avebury Henge, Wiltshire, England. August 1994. Wheat crop, approximately 250feet[images/Fig-109.jpg]Inside the Avebury WebNORTH DOWN, 2000The transcendent North Down formation is the only true eleven-fold formationever to have appeared. There have been circles that have incorporated elevencomponents, or numbers that have implied eleven-ness, but geometricallyspeaking, eleven is incredibly rare. Perhaps this appropriately reflects therarity of eleven as a number, and its association with transcendental andrarefied visionary states of mind.The design used curving lines, like folds, to divide the circle into elevensections. This is difficult enough to approximate on paper, without working on ahuge scale. Contemplating the shape, it seems that these curves may suggest asort of semi-rotational opening and closing of the central space, perhaps arhythmic gateway of sorts?Certainly, this formation had a profound effect on many of those that visitedit. It seemed to have a unique, almost trance-like atmosphere.[images/Fig-110.jpg]North Down, Wiltshire, England. July 2000. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feet TWELVE AND THIRTEEN: TRANSCENDING THE DECAD (PART 2)DODECAGON, DODECAGRAM AND TRISKAIDEKAPHOBIAThe importance of the number twelve can hardly be overstated. Twelve wassometimes known as the solar number that governed the twelve hours of the dayand the twelve hours of night and the twelve months of a solar year. Twelve alsodivided the heavens into the constellations of the zodiac. It was the numberused by the ancients as a way to divide time, space and motion. Twelve is thenumber of the spokes on the great wheel of time, or the wheel of man's fortune.It was important to some ancient cultures that the Earth should mirror theheavens – 'on Earth as it is in Heaven' – 'as above, so below'. Therefore, thenumber twelve was enshrined in their units of measurement. The British and UScustomary 'foot' embodies this idea (there are twelve inches in a foot). Othercultures still use similar twelve-unit systems.A dodecahedron is a shape with twelve identical faces.Each face is a pentagon, linking the numbers twelve and five together. If fiveis the number of life, then perhaps twelve is the number of the fulfilment ofman's potential. And with this in mind, it is time to meet the last number inour journey – thirteen.Thirteen is another much maligned number and is often considered unlucky, and tobe avoided at all costs. In the Tarot deck, the card bearing this number iscalled Death – no wonder, then, that it engenders so much fear. Fear of thenumber thirteen is called 'triskaidekaphobia'.However, this makes more sense, and becomes a little less doom-laden, when werealize that the number thirteen is the 'number of transformation' – after all,what is death if not the ultimate and most mysterious transformation?Both twelve and thirteen have been used in crop circle design. Twelves are oftenbeautiful; thirteens, like sevens and elevens, are mysterious and enigmatic.[images/Fig-111.jpg]There are several different twelve-pointed stars possible. If you look closely,this one is in fact made of four equilateral triangles which nicely illustratesthe relationship between 3, 4 and 12. The triangles each have three equal sides,multiply them by four and you have the twelve points of the dodecagram.HONEY STREET, 2001The amazing Honey Street twelve-fold, repeated the number twelve three times, ineach of the three concentric rings. With each successive iteration, thearrow-head shapes become smaller, until finally in the central ring, thearrow-heads become very fine and take on an almost rotational pattern.[images/Fig-112.jpg]Honey Street, Wiltshire, England. August 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 200feetEXPRESSIONS OF TWELVE–NESSFor several years a series of bubble-like formations appeared in both Wiltshireand Hampshire, and these incorporated the number twelve. Stephen's Castle Downwas a straightforward division by twelve around the perimeter; whereas Bishop'sSutton, whilst still using twelve perimeter circles, has the diametersdecreasing and increasing. The Clanfield formation emphasized the relationshipbetween the numbers three and four to twelve-ness (4 × 3 or 3 × 4 = 12).[images/Fig-113.jpg]Stephen's Castle Down, Hampshire, England. July 2000.

Wheat crop, approximately 250 feet"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOSACRED SPACETEMPORARY TEMPLES FOR THE MODERN AGENow that we have come to the end of our voyage from one to thirteen, we findthat we have the basic vocabulary of the crop circles at our disposal. As youlook through the remaining sections of this book, you will be able to spot thebasic numbers encoded in the formations to come.For those with the inclination, drawing the crop circles can be an edifying andinsightful undertaking. Black and white silhouettes are often constructed byresearchers (with black traditionally denoting the fallen crop) to help searchfor any hidden (esoteric) geometries underpinning a design. If you follow thecrop circles, a medium-sized sketch-book or scrap-book for keeping notes,sketches and cuttings can be invaluable in building up a good picture of anyseason.However, before we leave behind the world of geometry there are two furthergeometric principles that should be discussed when trying to understand thecircles. Both are involved specifically in the creation of sacred space and withthe ambience created inside the crop circles; one is the squaring of the circle,and the other is the Golden Section.SQUARING THE CIRCLEThe squaring of the circle is an Ancient Greek geometrical problem or mysticalquest. The challenge is to draw both a circle and a square whose perimeters (andareas) are the same, using only a geometer's tools of ruler and compass.Strictly speaking this is an impossible task as the nature of the circle makesit impossible to calculate its precise circumference, which is why we use thenever-ending pi. And it is, therefore, clearly impossible to draw a square withan equal measure. However, over time, many close approximations have beendiscovered (see below for an example), and the squaring of the circle has becomea central tenet of sacred geometry to which much special significance has beenattached.At this juncture, it might be a good question to ask why such an impossible taskshould be so significant to so many, and should warrant even closeapproximations so important as to be attempted and devised. When we ask thisquestion we begin to uncover the true significance of this famous geometricalpuzzle, because the answer lies in the symbolism of the circle and the square.As we have already discovered, the unique qualities of the circle are seen tosymbolize the Divine, or the divine realm; immeasurable and unknowable. Thesquare is, then, symbolic of the material realm – matter, substance and mass –or in short, the World.Leonardo da Vinci's famous rendering of Vitruvian Man depicts the squaring ofthe circle in conjunction with the human form. The drawing explores humanproportions in relation to the (divine) circle and the (material) square andperhaps embodies the belief that the human being is partly of the physical worldas he has a physical body and partly of the spiritual world as he has animmortal soul. In other words, man himself is a meeting place between heaven andearth.To ancient temple builders, to the builders of the Gothic cathedrals and otherimportant places of worship, this concept was fundamental. The temple was ameeting place between man and God, between Heaven and Earth. A space thatembodied this communion, not only in word and deed but also in stone, would be aspace filled with the very essence of this spiritual union. Many temples ofantiquity (and some that are standing today) combine the circle and square intheir design – the Pantheon, the Al-Aska Mosque and St Peter's Basilica, to namea few.[images/Fig-119.jpg]Many formations have squared the circle but not all are easy to see. AveburyManor, seen below, is one of the best examples.AVEBURY MANOR, 2005The wonderful Avebury Manor formation of 2005 was the Celtic cross of Celticcrosses. The diagram (above) by the crop circle researcher and geometer AllenBrown shows how the formation squares the circle on a large scale. It does, infact, square the circle several more times. The design also fits neatly onto athree-by-three (nine) squared grid – which could imply that this is theculmination of the Celtic cross design.The interior space created by this formation was particularly interesting. Itwas like walking around a great manor with four wings and many rooms. The centrecircle contained a beautiful ring of woven crop, which could be seen even in theaerial photograph. It truly felt like a meeting place of heaven and earth.[images/Fig-121.jpg][images/Fig-120.jpg]Avebury Manor, Wiltshire, England. July 2005. Approximately 300 feetTHE GOLDEN SECTIONAlso called the Golden Proportion, Golden Mean or Golden Ratio, this is one ofthe most mysterious tenets of Sacred Geometry.At its most basic, the Golden Section is a way of dividing a line to create athree-fold relationship between the two smaller lines created and the originalline before it was divided. The ratio created is 1: 0.618… and is better knownas 'phi' or ø. Phi is what is called an 'irrational number' – a number that hasno whole number resolution and whose decimal places theoretically stretch intoinfinity; the device phi is used to create the illusion of a whole number, sothat it becomes easier to understand and use.Phi is most commonly associated with the number five, mainly because it isgenerated over and over again within the geometry of the pentagram. Thisassociation is the first clue to some of the deeper and more mysterious aspectsof phi, as this ratio lies at the heart of the growth patterns of all livingthings, including seed germination, root development, leaf distribution and eventhe dimensions of the human body.Because of this link, many see the Golden Section as the 'breath of God' as itpasses through matter and animates it. Like wave patterns on a beach, theethereal Golden Section is made visible in growth patterning and shows us wherethe life-force has acted upon matter.The Golden Section is also made visible in the spirals of certain shells, pinecones, weather systems and whirlpools; it is the most common spiral foundthroughout nature. Unlike the Archimedean spiral, whose curves remain constant,the curves of the Golden Spiral increase progressively.Many artists and philosophers consider the Golden Section as the chief factor inwhat we consider most beautiful. It has been shown in a number of different waysthat human beings have a natural and inbuilt penchant for this ratio – thecloser the proportions of the face to that of the Golden Section, the morebeautiful we consider it to be.Both the squaring of the circle and the Golden Section have been used in thecreation of sacred space for thousands of years. They are revered for theirtranscendent effect on human consciousness, for their ability to conjure asymbolic communion between Heaven and Earth and to permeate the subconsciousmind with the imprint of sublime beauty and the breath of God, as thoughbreathed into the very space created by these very special proportions andratios. Their inclusion in crop circle design has lead many to consider thepossibility of a mystical or spiritual component to the crop circle mystery.TEMPORARY TEMPLES FOR THE MODERN AGEIf you have ever visited a truly great temple or cathedral, you may well havebeen moved by its architectural space. Many of the great buildings of antiquitywere designed using nature's canon of number and proportion – exactly the samecanon of number and proportion we find in the crop circles. Specifically,architects used the marriage of the circle and square to symbolize the temple orchurch as a meeting place between man and God, and the Golden Section representsthe ineffable power of God to breath life into the world.Crop circles can have a very similar, if not parallel, effect to that of templesor cathedrals, and it is interesting to notice the way people behave inside theformations. Although their size regularly prevents much understanding of theiroverall shape at ground-level, the effect of their spaces on visitors is oftenremarkable. Some of the larger circles, in particular, are awe-inspiring intheir size and construction. Inside the formations, the water-like flow of thelaid crop, upon which you walk, gives a sense of movement, and the summersunshine reflects off its surface, changing as you move around. Visitors becomecalm and seek out a quiet spot to sit and contemplate their experience. Oftenpeople feel drawn towards the centre of the formation, or some other significantpoint. This kind of experience has become commonplace in crop circle lore butwhy should this be?[images/Fig-122.jpg]Harmonic forms in water under the effect of sound vibrations. These standingwave patterns occur within small samples of water placed upon a lens andilluminated from below, while vibrating in response to specific audiblefrequencies (Cymatics)The answer seems to lie with the crop circles' shapes; but why the circle, whythe triangle, why the square?Shape is a fundamental response to vibration. There is a science of vibration;it is called Cymatics and was formally invented and named in the 1950s by HansJenny, a Swiss scientist. By linking vibrating plates to amplifiers andoscilloscopes to monitor and change the frequency of the vibration beingapplied, Jenny was able to show that matter responds directly to vibration, byordering itself according to the frequency used. Jenny applied vibrations tomany different materials, for example, oil of turpentine floating on water; andvolumes of liquid, for example, from tanks of water to small drops of it on alens. When these water drops are lit from below (see above), the resultingpatterns from vibrations acting on the water can be seen and photographed.The results are surprisingly geometric and many look very much like crop circlepatterns, leading people to speculate that vibration might be involved in cropcircles' creation.Now consider the fact that sounds and music are also vibrations. They arevibrations of a frequency that are audible to the human ear; there are of coursemany frequencies, both low and high, that we cannot hear.We know that sounds, and especially music, can have a profound psychologicaleffect upon us. Music can move us to tears, terrify us, and evoke a wide rangeof other emotions. If shape is a fundamental response to vibration, it stands toreason that shape may have a similar effect on the psyche. Although inaudibleand at present unmeasurable, it has been postulated that we might be sensitiveto such a subtle phenomenon as this, and that it may have a distinctpsychological effect similar to that evoked by music.Many believe that some of the ancients were well aware of this kind ofphenomenon and used it deliberately to great effect in the temples of antiquity.Crop circles could therefore be regarded as 'Temporary Temples for the ModernAge': although only transitory (due to being formed in crops), whilst in situthey create a space which engenders a sense of power and sacredness that isundeniably palpable.PEWSEY WHITE HORSE, 2002During the summer of 2002, this wonderful shell-like formation appeared. It wasimmediately nicknamed the Nautilus Shell. The nautilus is noted for its GoldenSection spiral shape. Both the shell and this formation embody the proportionsof growth found throughout all living organisms. The human ear is based upon thesame spiral, including the delicate inner section known as the cochlea, whichreceives vibrations from the outside world. The human embryo also develops inthe same shape. The wonderful thing about this spiral is that it unfolds fromwithin itself, a curious property, which means that in a way it makes visiblethe invisible, creating something from seemingly nothing. Another fascinatingproperty is that as it unfolds, its numbers reach towards a resolution of theineffable phi, becoming ever closer but never reaching its goal.[images/Fig-123.jpg]Pewsey, Wiltshire, England.

Or perhaps you have felt that there wassomething missing, some elusive piece that if you could just find (or even turnaround) would make things complete? Or maybe at times you have felt that nomatter what you do, your life seems determined to follow some mysteriouspre-ordained path? If so, you are already intimately acquainted with thearchetypal world of labyrinths, mazes and puzzles.Almost since the inception of civilization, labyrinths, mazes and puzzles havebeen used as metaphors for the journey or pattern of life. It is in our verynature to seek out patterns, connect the dots, it is these vital skills thathelp us recognize things and ultimately to make sense of our life. It is anotherexample of how important the idea of shape and pattern is to our minds.Before we go any further, a couple of definitions would be helpful. Labyrinthsand mazes are not the same and they are often confused. A labyrinth is a singlewinding pathway, which one can but follow; whereas a maze offers a choice ofpathways, in which you can get lost. The labyrinth is ritually walked, withseveral preordained curves, which lead inexorably to the centre – no other routeis offered or is possible. The traditional labyrinth has between five and eightturns, the one in Chartres cathedral has thirteen. Once again, the numbers atplay can reveal much about the principle behind each design; thirteen is thenumber of transformation, the goal of the Chartres labyrinth and of theChristian belief in life beyond death for the faithful. The labyrinth may alsobe symbolic of the self, at its centre the heart or essence of the self. Thepurpose of life is to find that authentic self, to strip away the layers andmasks (symbolized by the turns) and to find our true nature. In contrast, themaze is about choice and consequence. A maze offers many pathway choices, butonly the right one will get you to the centre and back again; the wrong choicewill see you helplessly lost. Puzzles are about choice too, but they are aboutchallenges and resolutions. The key to many puzzles is imagination and theability to see things from a different perspective.In the world of labyrinths, mazes and puzzles, you can lose yourself hopelessly,or maybe find your true and unfettered self.WEST KENNETT, 2004This wonderful eight-sided star (octogram) contained an inner circle dividedinto four. Each quadrant contained a labyrinthine spiral, which curved aroundinto the centre, following the quarter shape of the section. However,interestingly, the entrance to each section appears unclear. Four-ness seems topervade this design, although the outer perimeter looks like an octogram, itcould also be seen as two overlaid squares, with the four inner sections alsospeaking of four.[images/Fig-124.jpg]West Kennett, Wiltshire, England. July 2004. Wheat crop, approximately 300 feetTHE QUATERNITY OF THE SELFThe question of the mandala is something we will consider further in laterpages, but if labyrinths and mazes can be seen as symbolic of the self, thenthis four-fold design surely represents what Jung called 'The Quaternity of theSelf'. Jung believed that there were four basic functions of the self –thinking, feeling, sensing and intuition – and that these functions were thebasis of our interaction with the world. The intersection on the circle with twolines at right-angles to one other seems instinctual and natural. Thislabyrinthine formation seemed to be an invitation to walk each quadrantconsidering our four-fold self; which is our most dominant sense and which isour most underdeveloped?GREAT SHELFORD, 2001This astonishing formation is one of the largest crop circle rings on record.The maze itself was 237 feet in diameter; still it looks dwarfed by its giantenclosing circle, which had a diameter of 666 feet. This is a real maze andthere is a real solution, can you find it?Even though this formation seems to have no overall organization or order, thereis some lovely detail work. The tiny scroll attached to the maze is justbeautiful. And the group of six nested squares, seven with curved corners, isalso very pleasing to the eye; the spacing between each square is wonderfullyregular.The maze can also be likened to the spider's web. Folklore tells us that themaze was used to temporarily entrap unwanted or troublesome spirits. Once ledinto the maze, these bothersome entities would have to remain there until theymanaged to find their way out – thus ensuring a period of relief for thoseunfortunate enough to have attracted their attentions.In other tales, it is the spirits that dwell in the maze. The fate of those whostray within their realm is perpetual bewilderment and eternal wandering.Far from being a puzzle of pure reason and logic, the maze is also a mysticalspace that carries a fascinating warning about enchantment and entrapment.[images/Fig-125.jpg]Great Shelford, Cambridge, England. July 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 600feetWEST WOODS, LOCKERIDGE, 2005This formation is based upon a spiral made from box shapes, gradually increasingin size from the centre. The central spiral shape is then enclosed by eightfurther boxes with strangely curved ends. The whole design is then placed withina containing circle.The link between the labyrinth and the spiral lies in the fact that to walk aspiral is like walking a labyrinth. We move from the outer regions progressivelyinto the centre.The whole point of the labyrinth is to reach the centre and many crop circledesigns are labyrinthine in nature; they encourage or invite a journey to bemade to the heart of the formation. Some are more obvious than others, but manywho visited this lovely formation at West Woods instinctively felt the needritually to walk the inner spiral to reach the centre.[images/Fig-126.jpg]West Woods, Lockeridge, Wiltshire. June 2005. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetBISHOPS CANNINGS DOWN, 2000This formation was a real puzzle of standing and fallen shapes which when piecedtogether form a circle. It was quickly nicknamed the 'Chinese Puzzle' inreference to its puzzling nature.[images/Fig-128.jpg][images/Fig-127.jpg]Bishops Cannings Down, Wiltshire, England. June 2000. Wheat crop, approximately150 feetWADEN HILL, 2005This lovely formation has a puzzling centre. The central triangle presents uswith an optical illusion, a three-dimensional shape which cannot exist inthree-dimensional space. Over the years, crop circles have presented us with anumber of optical illusions which seem to defy our reality constructs.[images/Fig-129.jpg][images/Fig-130.jpg]Waden Hill, Wiltshire, England. July 2005. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetALDBOURNE, 2004This amazing formation at Aldbourne was something of a puzzle. The interiorpattern is overlaid onto a nine-by-nine grid and contains sixty-nine squares ofvaried design, with three squares on each corner seemingly missing. At firstthis might not seem important, but it is in fact a clue to the hidden geometrythat underpins this design. Imagine that a circle is drawn around the innergrid, clipping the corners of the grid design where squares appear to bemissing. Then we square the design by drawing a square around the grid. Thiscircle and square are in a squared circle relationship (in area), accurate toabout 97.5 percent.The designs of the individual squares are also intriguing. Some are juststanding squares, whilst others are combinations of standing and flattenedsquares; each square is further divided into four to allow this patterning. Manynumbers are at play, but the numbers four and nine seem most prevalent.The pattern seems to show a huge X or cross at its centre and its meaning is amystery. I have often wondered if it refers to the idea of multiplication, thekey to unlocking the area of any shape; in this case, the areas of the circleand square and the squared circle relationship between the two.[images/Fig-96.jpg]Aldbourne, Wiltshire, England. August 2004. Wheat crop, approximately 300 feetFOREST HILL, NEAR SAVERNAKE, 2004This huge circle at Savernake was based on a nine square grid. If you turnalternate squares another pattern is formed.

Wheat crop, approximately 300feetBECKHAMPTON, 1995This circle could easily have been included in our section on spirals; however,such was the effect of the interior on those that visited it, that almosteveryone felt under obligation to walk it and follow its meanderings, around andaround, into the centre and then out again. The labyrinthine intent of thisdesign was unmistakable, and utterly compelling.This spiral contained nine revolutions, which had to be negotiated beforereaching the centre – nine steps, phases or stages to be navigated and passedthrough in order to find the heart or essence of this design.Nine is the number of culmination, which contains all before it and whichresides at the threshold of basic number. There seemed to be somethingportentous and potentially transformative about the numbers encoded in thisdesign.[images/Fig-132.jpg]Beckhampton, Wiltshire, England. May 1995.

They canbe used to establish and replicate distances accurately. Rope or thread canassist in the demarcation of any space and, before the geometer's compass, therope and marker were the basic apparatus needed for the creation of a circle.The simplest compass can be made from a pencil and a length of thread; byanchoring one end of the thread with a finger or a pin and tying the pencil tothe other end, a circle may be drawn by circling the pencil around the securecentre point – keeping the thread taut.When a thread or rope is tied with knots at regular intervals it can then beused to create other important shapes, including the right-angled triangle (90degrees) and other angles and forms necessary for construction and building. Arope with 13 equally spaced knots can help create a whole series of fundamentalshapes without the need for a ruler, or even a grasp of basic geometry.Symbolically the rope, thread or ribbon is a tether; perhaps a link or ladderbetween Heaven and Earth; it represents that intimate connection between motherand child, the umbilical cord; the rope, thread and cord imply connection,relationship, binding and eternal love.Knots signify the binding together of two or more parts, the lovers' knotsignifies the entwining of hearts and bodies in the mystical act of love – thenever-ending knot is a symbol of eternity. However, some knots signify bondagewhen they are used to constrain or restrict freedom. They can also symboliseconfusion, disorder, irresolvable chaos and even madness.Of course, one cannot talk about threads and knots without mentioning weaving.Weaving is an ancient craft, which is also symbolic of connection, relationship,shape and pattern. Gold and silver threads and ribbons of all colours have beenused in the art of decoration for thousands of years. Often they are used todraw attention to important people, or perhaps a beautiful face. The belt orsash is a common symbol of authority or rank.How often do we hear people describe themselves as being 'tied up in knots' or'tied down', feeling 'duty bound'; in psychology they speak of 'the ties thatbind'. Knots, ropes and ribbons are an integral part of our lives and our way ofthinking; they are another archetypal theme that literally binds humanitytogether.WINDMILL HILL, 2003This formation at Windmill Hill clearly represents rope or twisted thread. Itcontains twelve segments that lock together. The shape is four-sided, combiningthe idea of the square and the rope. If four represents material reality and theworld, and twelve represents the destiny of man, then perhaps this cordrepresents man's fate of being temporarily tethered to this earthly realm.[images/Fig-134.jpg]Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England. June 2003. Barley crop, approximately 300feetBECKHAMPTON, 1999This design mimics a folded and flattened ribbon. The ribbon is folded into aknot with no beginning or end; two triangular shapes are combined to create asix-fold form. The elegance of this design is easy to overlook, and theingenious layout ensures that the central space remains open and accessible tovisitors via the folds in the ribbon, which are outlined by narrow tracks. Thecentral element seems to imply some sort of movement, almost like the shuttermechanism of a camera, which would open and close with a rotational movement.[images/Fig-135.jpg]Beckhampton, Wiltshire, England. July 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetADAMS GRAVE, 2000The lovely basket-weave circle below Adams Grave (an ancient longbarrow) is oneof only a small number to have their floor patterns woven in such a specializedmanner. Walking on top of this carpet of wheat was rather disconcerting, as youwere painfully aware of the damage you were causing!Weaving is one of the oldest craft forms known to man and often involvesrhythmic, iterative movement and patterning, another important principle foundin nature.[images/Fig-137.jpg]Adam's Grave, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England. July 2000. Wheat crop,approximately 120 feetETCHILHAMPTON, 2002The huge ribbon-esque formation at Etchilhampton measured approximately 300 feetin diameter. This was yet another six-fold design, with six inter-connectedcircles or loops of ribbon. Once again, access was gained via the folds of theribbons. Interestingly, the central space was implied rather than actual, it wasthe meeting point or mysterious emanating point for the ribbon itself.[images/Fig-136.jpg]Etchilhampton, Wiltshire, England. August 2002. Wheat crop, approximately 400feetAVEBURY TRUSLOE, 2002The year 2002 was a year of ribbons, knots and ropes; the theme was exploredmany times that summer. One of the first circles to appear was the lovely Celticknot at Avebury Trusloe. The formation used more six-fold geometry in itsdesign; in fact many of the ribbon formations seem concerned with six-ness,order and structure in space. Once again, this was a never-ending knot, sixoverlapping loops confined within an implied circle. Curiously, there werethirty-nine tiny loops around the perimeter of this circle, rather irregularlyplaced, thirty-nine divided by three is thirteen, the transformative number.[images/Fig-138.jpg]Avebury Trusloe, Wiltshire, England. June 2002. Barley crop, approximately 200feetSTONEHENGE, 2002It is always considered a rare and marvellous privilege when a crop circleoccurs close to Stonehenge, one of England's most famous ancient sites. Thecircles are interpreted as important formations and often attract the media anda wider public attention. This fantastic example appeared in July 2002, early inthe season and not reserved for a spectacular grand finale in August, as onemight expect. There were several noteworthy things about this formation that weshould take time to consider. First is its immense size; at approximately 750feet in diameter, this design was an excellent example of the relationshipbetween size and power. Second is the way this circle was positioned in thefield, which contained a number of round barrows (ancient burial mounds). Notehow several of the arms clip one or more of these barrows or, as in one case,the perimeter of the field. This gives the impression of the formation beingnestled between these features. Its placement implies considerable skill workingon a large scale. This circle, like so many others, appeared in its entiretyovernight, complete, whole and perfect; stretching the imagination considerablyas to its possible origins.Once more, six-fold geometry is embodied in this design with six billowingribbons emanating from a mysterious empty space in the centre. Close to thecentre, the pattern hints at a rose-type design, but a rotational unfolding alsoappears to be suggested (as with several of the ribbon formations). Theunderpinning geometry is entirely circular, meaning that the whole design can bepicked from a series of underlying circles.There is something in this shape that speaks of freedom and generation. Thisformation seems to be a frozen snapshot of movement in space, of free-flowing,unbound liberty. Perhaps this idea was also echoed in the date of the formation:4 July, American Independence Day.[images/Fig-139.jpg]Stonehenge, Wiltshire, England. July 2002.

Spinning can bea metaphor for disorientation, confusion, even delirium; it can signify feelingout of control.Sufis have been spinning and whirling themselves into states of ecstasy forthousands of years. During their dervish dances they deliberately disorientatetheir conscious minds, to gain access to altered states of consciousness.Above all, spirals and spinners are about movement, unfolding and growth. Natureoften uses unfolding in her growth processes; the unfurling of spirals in ferns,petals and the human foetus are just a few examples of how fundamental thisprinciple is to the world in which we live. We are, in fact, in a constant stateof spinning and revolving. Our planet rotates on its axis once every twenty-fourhours and orbits around the sun once every year. On a larger scale, our wholegalaxy is spinning, and even though we might feel as if we are standingperfectly still, we are actually moving at an incredible speed through space.Foucault's Pendulum demonstrates the movement of the earth, and the universebeyond, around the dimensionless still centre round which the whole of creationmoves. The pendulum can be made to mark its path by tracing lines and curvesonto sand; theoretically, the end of the pattern should meet up perfectly withthe beginning, if the pendulum has been placed exactly on one of the earth's twopoles. This neatly illustrates how fundamental spinning, swirling and unfoldingare to the nature of life on Earth and the universe. The patterns traced bythese pendulums are often similar to crop circle designs.Other familiar spirals include swirling weather systems. Hurricanes, typhoons,tornados and whirlwinds are fundamentally spiralling weather patterns – thelarger weather systems are beautiful when seen from space, although sometimesdeadly when encountered on Earth. Spirals and spinning occur when two opposingforces meet and they move around each other, trying to find a resolution.Spirals are intimately connected with gravity, which tempers their speed,direction and size.Spirals and spinners are an integral part of the crop circle phenomenon, thecircle floor-lays often display evidence of a revolving force moving over andthrough the crop, leaving in its wake exquisite swirled carpets of wheat andbarley stems. Often, crop circle designs incorporate a sense of spinningmovement in their shapes.[images/Fig-144.jpg]WILTON WINDMILL, 2004This lovely formation close to the Wilton Windmill could easily have been ablueprint for a six-fold set of windmill sails.

Whilst some crop formations clearlydepict life-forms with which we are familiar, some have presented us withvisions of the alien and unknown. How are we to approach these creatures? Whatare we to make of them?Animals, creatures, monsters and mythical beasts are a fundamental part of ourreal and imaginary lives and their forms are indelibly and deeply etched intothe human psyche. Our connection with animals is emphasized by our keeping offamily pets, the farming of animals, and the array of creatures we keep incaptivity in zoos and amusement parks.However, nowhere is the animal form more at work than in our dreams, nightmares,legends and nowadays, in the world of cinema – just think of theadrenalin-inducing Jaws, Godzilla or King Kong. For many of us, there is nothingmore terrifying than a monster, a giant spider or a snake. In some ways animalscan represent our own animal nature; as the pre-eminent animal on the planet, itis perhaps only when we meet the monstrous that we come face-to-face with ourown limitations and fragility.Our earliest ancestors included numerous animals in their cave paintings, evencreatures that combined both animal and man (therianthropes). Great cultureshave also venerated deities that either combine human and animal forms oractually take on animal shapes. Animals can embody noble qualities or becomesynonymous with them; like the cunning fox, the wise owl and the faithful dog.The Great Bear, Taurus the Bull and Cancer the Crab, along with many others, arecreatures that have been elevated to the heavens as star constellations in ournight sky. With the incredible diversity of life on this planet, who can saywhat other forms of life might exist elsewhere – perhaps the crop circles offerus the opportunity to consider this very question along with that of our ownanimal nature.BECKHAMPTON, 1998The huge Beckhampton formation had a definite aquatic feel to it and was quicklynamed the Manta Ray. Its extremely long tail was made from a succession of tinycircles and ended with a grouping that looked like some kind of stinger. Theinterior space of the body contained a remarkable floor-lay, with the crop sweptin all directions. It was not until we saw the aerial view that the patterningmade any sense.[images/Fig-158.jpg]Beckhampton, Wiltshire, England. July 1998.

Was this a biological form or a mechanical one? Whateverit was, visitors to this circle experienced a whole range of electrical faultsto their cameras and mobile phones whilst inside it. The formation at Wilsford,although probably not a creature itself, is of the same type.

It is reminiscent of the feathered serpent, Quetzalcoatl,venerated by the Aztecs (and known to the Maya as Kukulcan) although admittedlythey never represented him like this in their art works. The mixing of bird andserpent species seems uniquely and essentially Meso-American. In sometraditions, Quetzalcoatl was a civilizing god who, for a while, turned thepeople away from their human sacrifices and encouraged them to create a morecultured society. Other legends tell us that he came from a race of god-likemen, from a civilization destroyed by cataclysm whose survivors had beenscattered all over the face of the earth.[images/Fig-168.jpg]Woodborough Hill, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England.

Note how the body is formed from thealmond-shaped vesica. The placement and shapes of the legs are formed byrotational geometry. The circle is first divided into 24 equal sections and thencurves are drawn in rotation, which connect various points to one another.

The Alton Barnesformation showed us three swallows swooping in flight; whilst the Clatfordswallows were shown in a circular formation, each with their wing-tips touching.Traditionally, birds signify the spirit. The Alton Barnes birds certainly liftedthe spirits of all who came into contact with them and seemed to symbolize thefreeing of the spirit. The Clatford birds could signify the three-fold nature ofthe self: mind, body and spirit. Interestingly, one of these birds was largerthan the other two – one can only puzzle over the meaning of such things.[images/Fig-172.jpg]Clatford Bottom, Wiltshire, England. June 2005.

There are no words, no immediately identifiable language or code andso, in using the tools of our verbal and literal culture, our firstinterpretations of them are greatly diminished and unequal to the task. Cropcircle designs are very seldom obvious or superficial, they are geometricmetaphors, similes and allegories. Strictly speaking, therefore, crop circlesare symbolic rather than merely signs. Signs are a form of cultural code, animage that substitutes a specific word or phrase. A symbol is much moreencompassing; it is a visual embodiment of an archetypal function of truth.Without understanding the symbolic nature of the crop circles, and applying onlyliteralism, their designs might be seen as nothing more than arbitrary, prettyor clever. However, when their symbolic nature is embraced, the circles reveal aworld rich in meaning and metaphor. It is a straightforward matter of emphasisin perception. A useful approach is to consider the difference between lookingat something, in comparison to really seeing it. Suddenly, the world, instead ofbeing full of the mundane, arbitrary, empty and the solely functional, becomesone enriched with significance and patterning. What begins as a way ofunderstanding this mysterious phenomenon becomes a whole new philosophy ofperception.That said, on occasion, the crop circles have presented us with the morefamiliar; signs and symbols that are already part of our vocabulary. But do notbe fooled into reverting to the old literal ways of looking; be prepared to diga little deeper and see the archetypal principles that are being expressed.EAST FIELD, ALTON BARNES, 2001 AND HIGHCLERE, 2002The Alton Barnes pyramid appeared on the morning of the summer solstice 2001; itclearly shows the sun rising over the apex of the pyramid. This was more than alittle apt, as the sun also rose exactly over the apex of the Great Pyramid inGiza, Egypt, on the solstice that year. The pyramid at Highclere, just over ayear later, was of a different character altogether, this design had clearmasonic overtones. For the Freemasons, the pyramid with an eye at its apexrepresents the all-seeing God, the Grand Architect of the Universe, thebrilliance reflects the shining countenance of the divine. The symbol of theall-seeing eye now carries conspiratorial connotations, seen as a metaphor forthe New World Order, Big Brother and other such oppressive ideals.[images/Fig-264.jpg]East Field, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England.

It is an unusual double image; one way up itis a tree of many fruits with many roots; reversed, it is a mushroom with manyspores in the ground. One needs light to grow and ripen its fruit, the otherneeds darkness to cocoon and nurture the growth of its spores.[images/Fig-175.jpg]East Field, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England. July 2002.

This formation was one of the first to imply the number eleven, witheleven main circles in its design. The curious little pattern that accompaniedit perplexed many, but it was suggested that it was a composition of the toolsneeded to maintain the menorah – oil-lamp, pincers and bowl. The menorah is litusing oil and wicks (not candles), so these items would be used to maintain theflame, a symbol of God's continuing spiritual light.[images/Fig-176.jpg][images/Fig-177.jpg]Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England.

The pattern is a mystical symbol, whichshows the forces, principles and functions that underlie the heavenly andearthly realms. The study of this spiritual philosophy is very ancient indeed.Interestingly, the Kabbala is, at root, concerned with the archetypal and thespiritual.[images/Fig-178.jpg]Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England. May 1997. Oilseed rape (canola) crop,approximately 200 feetBADBURY, 2001This amazing formation showed us the Ouroboros. Meaning 'tail-devourer', itshows a serpent eating its own tail. This is a traditional symbol of eternalwisdom, and the cycle of life, death and renewal. However, the design alsodepicts a turtle or tortoise at its centre. In Hindu mythology, the Ouroboros isa dragon who encircles a tortoise, which in turn supports the four elephantsthat carry the world on their backs.Inside the snake's body, the crop was woven and knotted. There was also anintricate feathering effect along the inside of the serpent's belly.[images/Fig-179.jpg]Badbury, Wiltshire, England. June 2001. Barley crop, approximately 200 feetWEST OVERTON, 1994The formation at West Overton might be familiar to us as the lemniscate, orinfinity symbol. Looking much like the figure eight on its side, it symbolizesthe looping, cyclic and dyadic nature of creation. All photographers will befamiliar with this same symbol on the focusing rings of their cameras,indicating the setting for infinity; sometimes the eight-shape appears slightlyflattened. The concept of infinity or eternity is one that the crop circles seemto be particularly concerned with, we shall see in our explorations of thefractals, how the circles have taken these concepts to an entirely new level.[images/Fig-180.jpg]West Overton, Wiltshire, England. July 1994. Wheat crop, approximately 150 feetMILK HILL, 2004You might be wondering why this circle did not appear in our section on Forms ofLife (here [chapter_006.html#page_114]). However, whilst this crop formationmight at first appear to be some kind of insect, it is undoubtedly animaginative take on the Caduceus – the winged staff carried by both Hermes(Greek) and Mercury (Roman), messengers of the gods. Traditionally, the staffalso has two serpents intertwined along its length – symbols of transformationand renewal.In modern times, the winged staff has become an international symbol of thehealing arts and medicine. Many pharmaceutical companies, hospitals andsurgeries display the Caduceus.The tentative suggestion of the messenger of the gods being at work in our cropfields is a seductive one, but more than that, it goes to show, yet again, howintimately these symbols are connected to our myths, legends and ultimately, toour psyche.[images/Fig-181.jpg]Milk Hill, Wiltshire, England. June 2004. Wheat crop, approximately 600 feetMANDALASHEALING THE LANDSCAPE AND THE MINDMandalas (Sanskrit for 'circle') are another form of archetypal symbolism. Wetraditionally think of them as spiritual devices, used in the contemplation ofthe patterns and forces which underlie creation. The seeker meditatively entersthe patterns – conventionally a square enclosed within a circle – tracing thelines and forms in search of insight or stillness from the chatter of the mind.The design of these ritual mandalas is essentially based on some of thegeometric philosophy we have explored in this book; many combine the circle andthe square, symbolic of the meeting of man and the Divine. There is however,another form of mandala, perhaps less well-known, and it might be called'mandala of the mind'. It was the psychoanalyst Carl Jung who first recognizedthe importance and significance of mandalas. His patients would often draw ordream of circular patterns, inside which many chaotic elements would becontained. Jung saw these patterns as images of the self, and noted that asthese patients began to progress in their therapy, so these once chaotic imageswould become progressively more ordered. Many crop circles could be classifiedas mandalas; perhaps they heal both us and our sometimes beleaguered and chaoticworld.ALTON PRIORS, 2001 AND BARBURY CASTLE, 2003These classic mandala-like designs are based on four-fold and six-fold geometryrespectively. Each divides the whole (or circle) equally and precisely. Thesimple order of design is pleasing to the eye, almost comforting and reassuring.Have you ever noticed how much asymmetry can irk the mind: that picture thatisn't straight on the wall; that something that seems out of place? Some of uscan live with a little more disorder than others, but too much disarray can beuncomfortable, even troubling.[images/Fig-182.jpg]Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England. July 2003.

The formation atLiddington Castle is a three-fold design, the level and order and symmetry isdetailed and a touch mechanical. It looks like a cog from some unknown machine.The Chisbury formation is almost its dyadic opposite. Here six-fold geometry isat work, but the pattern is based entirely on circular geometry, giving thedetails of this design a lace-like feel. Notice how the floor-lay of the outerring of the Chisbury circle is woven into a fish-bone design.[images/Fig-184.jpg]Liddington Castle, Wiltshire, England. July 1999.

In the traditional rendering of the Yin-Yangsymbol, each contains a little of the other and the two symbols spiral around,chasing each other to find a resolution, to become one.Yin-Yang also represents the masculine and feminine in all of us. It tells usthat we each have both of these principles within us and that both fit togetherperfectly to create one whole – the Yin-Yang symbols combine to create acircular mandala.[images/Fig-186.jpg]Avebury Henge, Wiltshire, England.

He has been guided by the position of stars when navigating the earthand, for some, man's fate is encoded in the constellations and their planetaryaspects. The planets were dedicated to ancient gods, or became their heavenlyembodiment in the night sky – Mars the God of War and Venus the Goddess of Love.The sun and the moon have always been accorded special veneration. One governsour day, the other our night; one governs our (lunar) months, the other our(solar) years. The sun is generally associated with masculinity, brilliant andstrong but sometimes severe and harsh; whereas the moon is associated with thefeminine, coy and beautiful but at times driving one to lunacy! In alchemy, themetal ascribed to the sun was gold, and silver for the moon; the eclipse of thetwo signified the marriage of Heaven and Earth.As many television science programmes seem fond of telling us, we ourselves aremade of the stuff of stars. Scientists also theorize that life itself many havebeen borne here on asteroids or comets that collided with Earth. The symbolismseems particularly apt: the comet with its shimmering, gaseous tail, piercingthe beautiful spherical Earth, giving rise to life on our planet, just as thesperm breaches the egg in order to initiate a human life.Ancient Egyptian texts tell us the Pharaohs believed that after death theirsouls would be propelled into the night sky to dwell with their gods, whoinhabited the twinkling firmament. According to one popular theory, they mayhave even built their pyramids to mirror the stars. Many ancient peoples were inawe of the sky and her heavenly bodies; their gods told them when to sow theircrops and when to harvest them; predicting times of plenty and the onset of thecold, harsh, winter months.Human culture has been intimately linked to the stars, moon and planets sincecivilization began. That we see them described by the crop circles isfascinating, but they are yet another archetypal theme as relevant to ourpsychological make-up as those of number, shape, labyrinths, mazes, threads andtethers. Over the years, the crop circles have given us stars, moons, planets,eclipses, asteroid belts and galaxies to contemplate.WEST KENNETT LONGBARROW, 2004 AND SILBURY HILL, 2002The star at Silbury Hill was a classic pentagram, whilst the sun and moon atWest Kennett seemed like a design depicting an eclipse. However, look carefullyat the interior floor-lay of the West Kennett formation and you will see that atiny swirl of crop appears inside it; the timing of the crop circle coincidedwith the transit of Venus across the sun during June 2004. Therefore, thiscircle could be showing the profile of Venus as it traversed the face of the sunthat summer. The next time this kind of celestial phenomenon occurs will be 6June 2012.[images/Fig-265.jpg]Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England. August 2002.

This formation contained 99individual circles with one ringed circle and two narrow orbit-like rings aroundwhich the whole design was arranged. Each circle was beautifully made, with avariety of swirls and standing central tufts incorporated to make the experienceon the ground every bit as awe inspiring as the view from the air. The formationwas placed on a sloping field and could be seen from the local main road.[images/Fig-193.jpg]Bishops Sutton, Hampshire, England. June 1995.

However, it was quicklyobserved that planet Earth had been left out and so it was called theEarth-is-missing Formation. To some this was a matter of grave concern,interpreting the crop circle as a messenger of doom; to others it signifiednothing more than the fact that the circle was located on planet Earth. Thisdesign clearly shows the sun at the centre, with Mercury, then Venus; there isan orbit indicated for the Earth; then Mars is shown; the whole thing is ringedby a string of circles, representing the asteroid belt that separates the innerplanets from the outer ones.[images/Fig-194.jpg]Longwood Warren, Hampshire, England.

Thistype of nested crescent motif has been used many times by the circle-makers,always to great effect. However, this is perhaps its most accomplishedincarnation. Two central rings are surrounded by six crescents, three standingand three flattened; the whole design is then contained in one large ring. Apartfrom the striking design (based entirely on circular geometry) what made thisformation particularly interesting was its placement in the landscape.From the photograph you can clearly see how the centre of this circle is placedon a tractor line which meets a natural break in the tree line at the side ofthe field. This kind of harmony and consideration for placement in the landscapesignificantly enhances the experience of walking the interior space. Thesynchronicity of such meaningful positioning can have a very marked effect onthe mind, leading one to contemplate the reasoning behind such attention todetail.[images/Fig-195.jpg]East Meon, Hampshire, England.

One contained a ringedsun-like disc, the other a crescent moon. They appeared to be chasing oneanother across the fields, just like the sun and moon eternally chase oneanother to create night and day. In 1999 (the year of the latest full solareclipse in the UK) an amazing formation appeared at Middle Wallop in Hampshire,which seemed to depict the various stages of an eclipse. The golden yellow ofthe oilseed rape (canola) crop seemed to highlight the solar aspect of thisheavenly event.

They can appear as undulating landscapes of the finest lace, wovenveils of shape and pattern, self-similar variations upon a theme; seeminglymultidimensional and holographic. This relatively modern branch of mathematicsfuses number, space and colour to make visible the peculiar world of abstractnumber functions.The term 'fractal' was first coined in the mid-1970s by Benoît Mandlebrot, thefather of modern fractals, and was derived from the Latin word fractus, whichmeans broken or irregular. The concept of fractals had long been known aboutbefore Mandlebrot, but it was his innovatory use of computers to generate, plotand visually display the outcome of the millions of recursive calculationsnecessary for complex fractals that gave birth to the contemporary era offractal mathematics and fractal geometry.The importance of his discovery is hard to overstate. Fractal geometry gavemathematicians and scientists a feasible model for calculating such things asthe length of an infinitesimally complex coastline, and the various branchingsystems found throughout the natural world. Fractals were able to simulateaccurately, for the first time, the complex shapes of clouds and even the bloodcirculatory system of the human body. Modern fractal mathematics was able togenerate and then map the tiny variations created by the recursive iteration ofsimple number equations, so as to create a viable imitation of the slightlyimperfect and sometimes random fluctuations of the natural world; somethingwhich that had thus so far eluded both science and mathematics.The computer generation of fractals has seen entire mountain ranges and even theunfurling fronds of fern leaves appear simulated on computer screens,demonstrating their fascinating potential to teach us about nature and theprocesses of generation and creation.Fractals have several important core properties. First is their use ofself-similarity. At their most basic, they can be a repetition of a singleshape, but on differing scales. In the Koch Snowflake, for example, an infinitenumber of triangular shapes that progressively diminish in size are continuallyadded to the perimeter of its shape. This means that the snowflake has aninfinite boundary, whilst in principle its area remains finite. This lastproperty is another important aspect of fractal geometry. They occupy a bizarrespace that holds together the opposing concepts of the infinite and the finitein one location. Not only is this a mathematical paradox, it also hasfascinating mystical connotations. The fractal beautifully and succinctlyillustrates a vision of a single finite creation, at the heart of which liesinfinite free-will and choice. Finally, another important property of fractalsis their ability to present a tangible visualization of infinity. No matter howmuch a fractal image is magnified, one always finds self-similar repetitions ofthe original fractal shape at every level. To dive headlong into these realms isto come face-to-face with eternity made manifest.However, far from being abstract, fractal geometry plays an important role inthe modern world. It sits at the hub of computer-generated imagery (CGI) whichcreates special effects for the film industry, and is also used in thecompression of digital photographic images.THE ICKLETON MANDLEBROT SET, 1991'A heart with complications' was how this crop circle was first described whenreported: it was a beautiful golden cardioid form in a field of wheat, close toIckleton in Cambridgeshire. It was quickly identified as a Mandlebrot Setfractal.The Mandlebrot is the fractal of fractals: whilst there are many versions ofother fractal types, there is only one Mandlebrot Set. The use of such a complexand relatively unheard of branch of mathematics in a crop circle design wasuncanny, to say the least – as was the fact that the circle lay not far fromwhere Mandlebrot had discovered his fractal, in Cambridge.[images/Fig-201.jpg]The Mandlebrot Set, Ickleton, Cambridgeshire. August 1991. Wheat crop,approximately 230 feetSTONEHENGE JULIA SET, 1996Along with the Ickleton Mandlebrot, the Stonehenge Julia Set Fractal is regardedas one of the greatest classic crop circle formations. It is very closelyrelated to the Mandelbrot Set, in that it is generated when a small variation isadded to the calculations used to generate the Mandelbrot Set. The Julia Setmanifests as a shape containing iterations of interconnecting spiral-likeelements.Whereas the Ickleton Mandelbrot had been fairly modest in scale, the StonehengeJulia Set was simply huge in comparison. It measured 915 feet along the lengthof the curve and contained 151 circles, all varying in diameter.Some geometers have claimed that the Julia curve was a Golden Section spiral,but this was not borne out by surveys carried out on the design in the field;the nature of the spiral is as yet unclassified. There are also several subtledesign components that make this crop circle a truly amazing work of art. Thecircles that comprise the main spiral-curve of the formation vary in size.Interestingly they are largest where the curve is at its most acute. Not onlydoes this accentuate the line of the curve, but it was also discovered that thelargest circles sat on the highest point of the ground, and, as the groundsloped downward, so the circles correspondingly reduced in size. Thissignificant detail shows the intricate way in which some crop circles are linkedto the topography and landscape – a fact not frequently acknowledged.However, the most startling aspect of the formation was its placement adjacentto the ancient stone circle, Stonehenge. The juxtaposition of the ancientgeometry used in the construction of Stonehenge and the ultra-modern fractalgeometry expressed by the crop circle was a potent symbolic gesture thatmagically bound together the ancient and the modern worlds.[images/Fig-203.jpg][images/Fig-202.jpg]The Stonehenge Julia Set fractal, Wiltshire, England. July 1996. Wheat crop,approximately 915 feet along the spineWINDMILL HILL, 1996 AND EAST FIELD, ALTON BARNES, 1996Despite its complex nature, the Stonehenge Julia was the second in a family ofthree major formations to appear that year. Beginning on 17 June, a huge stringof 89 circles that resembled the human DNA helix had appeared in Alton Barnes; 7July had seen the arrival of the Stonehenge Julia fractal; and on 29 July, ahuge triple-armed spiral containing 194 circles appeared at a place calledWindmill Hill and was soon named the Triple Julia, because of the seemingsimilarity between the Stonehenge and Windmill Hill formations. However, infractal geometry there is no such thing as a 'triple Julia set', and closerinspection of the formations reveals that the curves involved in the WindmillHill formation are nowhere near as acute as that of the Stonehenge fractal.Although only one of the three formations appeared to be a true fractal, theynevertheless had several features in common that called for them to be groupedtogether. First was their exclusive use of circles to achieve their overalldesign, and, more specifically, the use of many relatively small circlescompared to the size of the overall pattern. Second, there was the number ofcircles in the designs. Never before had so many individual elements been usedto create a crop circle pattern – this lead to the idea of a 'crop formation'.Lastly, there was the overall magnitude of these formations – from 648 feet forthe DNA Helix, to the 915 feet for the Stonehenge Julia, and just slightly under700 feet for Windmill Hill.Some have postulated that DNA uses self-similarity (a fractal-like property) toenable it to store huge amounts of information in one tiny vessel. So theseformations may ultimately have more to their relationship than similarity inconstruction.The so-called Triple Julia was so large that one visitor was actually able toride his bicycle through the formation. Like so many of the formations, thedesign was utterly incomprehensible from the ground – only the aerialphotographs could finally reveal the amazing totality of the structure.[images/Fig-204.jpg]The Triple Julia Set, Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England.

Barley crop,approximately 650 feetSILBURY HILL, 1997 AND MILK HILL, 1997During 1997, an amazing miracle occurred – we had beautiful snowflakes fallingat the height of the summer heat! These amazing formations were unmistakeablyKoch Snowflakes, a type of fractal first described in the early 1900s by HelgeVon Koch, a Swedish mathematician. The Koch Snowflake is one of the simplestvarieties of fractals. Most fractals, such as the Mandlebrot and Julia Sets areimpossible to draw on paper; the calculations involved in their construction aresimply vast and the points needed to plot the shapes are often so small as to bebeyond the visible. However, although we might only be able to plot severaliterations of the Koch Snowflake before they become too small for the pencil todraw accurately, it is possible for us to begin to understand the basicprinciples of fractal geometry.The Koch Snowflake essentially deals with divisions of a triangle. Beginningwith one equilateral triangle, the length of each side is divided by three and asmaller triangle (one third the size of the original) is added to the centre ofeach of the three sides of our starting triangle. The result of this firstiteration is the creation of a Star of David shape. The process is then repeatedwith even smaller triangles (each a third the size of the previous iteration)added to the middle of each side, until the triangles become so small that nofurther iterations can be drawn by hand. This very simple exercise generates ashape whose perimeter may carry on ad infinitum, becoming progressively morecomplex (and therefore longer), but whose core internal area remains largelyunchanged – in other words, we create a shape with a genuine paradox ofproperties.[images/Fig-206.jpg]Koch Snowflake, Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England. July 1997. Wheat crop,approximately 300 feetThe first Snowflake to occur was close to Silbury Hill. At the time, thisformation held the record for containing the largest area of flattened crop everrecorded in a crop circle – it was calculated to be no less than 0.86 acres.Although the crop circle showed only three iterations of the Koch fractal, thesmall circles around its perimeter were thought to be symbolic of furtherimplied iterations. The floor-lay of the crop led to more surprise; from theair, the interior of the circle created the impression of a three-dimensionalobject – a spider's web pattern visible in the flattened crop – the first timethis had been seen in a formation.The second Snowflake (below) was the pinnacle of that year, appearing at MilkHill, near Alton Barnes. This time the design contained a beautiful feature atits centre, a kind of inside-out Koch Snowflake. Once again, small circlessurrounded the main design. Each was unique and beautifully crafted; some hadstanding centres, and others had knots and nests of swirled wheat stems. Thelaid crop of this second Snowflake had qualities reminiscent of flowing water.[images/Fig-207.jpg]Inside the Milk Hill Snowflake[images/Fig-208.jpg]Koch II Snowflake, Milk Hill, Wiltshire, England. July 1997. Wheat crop,approximately 350 feetSILBURY HILL, 1999Along with the many true fractals that have appeared as crop circles, there area number of other crop circles that, whilst not true fractals, are neverthelessof the same family type – or are 'fractal-esque'. This amazing formationappeared close to Silbury Hill on 24th July 1999 and measured around 275 feetacross its diagonal.Here, the zigzag edges on each opposing arm are reminiscent of the outer edgesof the Koch Snowflakes of 1997, and they even have the accompanying tinycircles, which seem to represent further iterations of shape. Once again, thevast interior expanse of this formation was flattened in such a way as to createa secondary pattern in the laid crop, appreciable only from the air. So, whilenot a fractal in the strict mathematical sense, these formations usefractal-like characteristics in their design.[images/Fig-210.jpg][images/Fig-209.jpg]Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England. July 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 275 feetWINDMILL HILL, 1999 AND WEST KENNETT, 1999Reminiscent of a the floor design of a great fortress or temple, these twoformations are based on the principle of ever-decreasing squares. Like the KochSnowflakes, the re-iteration of smaller and smaller squares is then finished offwith small circles to imply a continuation of this process. Both of theseformations deal with the same core shapes; one is, in a loose sense, aninversion of the other.Both formations appeared close to the megalithic stone burial chamber at WestKennett.Notice, once again, the interior floor of the West Kennett formation and itsthree-dimensional effect.

Incidentally, the Sierspinski Gasket is now the pattern for theinternal aerials of mobile telephones, because it offers one of the best ways toachieve the largest aerial area in a confined space – a good example of thepractical use of fractal geometry.The branches of the pretty little tree at Farley Mount (below, bottom) aredivided using ever-decreasing iterations of the Golden Section.[images/Fig-214.jpg]Chilbolton, Hampshire, England.

This continuous division into two has a cumulative result, withthe sum of the perimeters of all the smaller contained circles in each sectionbeing equal to that of the original containing circle. Theoretically, divisionscan go on indefinitely until the curves of circles across the diameter become sominute that they are virtually indiscernable – and that is how a curved lineappears straight.[images/Fig-268.jpg]Clifford's Hill, Wiltshire, England.

There is something beautifully harmoniousabout this formation – it displayed an exquisite play on circles and curves,which was a running theme of the 2001 season. During any given season, themescan occur, which are then worked through and brought to a final resolution overseveral different formations. These circles are often labelled as siblings orfamily groups. Undulating through the centre of this particular formation iswater-like wave, which is key to its fractal-like properties. This circle uses aseries of three self-similar shapes, diminishing in size, to create the overalldesign.[images/Fig-267.jpg]Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England. July 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feetALTON BARNES, 2005This spectacular formation appeared in the natural amphitheatre of East Field inAlton Barnes, Wiltshire. Once again, this design is not a true fractal, but itdoes have fractal-esque features.Two successive pairs of diminishing squares create the main bulk of theformation. However, as we travel towards the middle of the formation, somethingunexpected happens. Another fractal-like square shape is implied at the verycentre, surrounded by an incredible collection of complex squares and oblongs.From a subjective point of view, this formation seemed to speak of fragmentationand simultaneous evolution of form.Notice the tiny boxes around the perimeter, reminiscent of the Koch Snowflakedesigns of 1997 (see here [chapter_009.html#page_150] and here[chapter_009.html#page_151]).[images/Fig-217.jpg][images/Fig-218.jpg]East Field, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England. July 2005. Wheat crop,approximately 350 feetTHE INTERFACE PATTERNSThe crop circles have at times presented us with formations that suggest somekind of energy field or system, interference patterns or waves. The meaning ofthese patterns is unknown but they are often intricate and fascinating. Whilemost circles combine geometric forms in a conventional manner, these shapes makeuse of the partial or total integration of two or more shapes to createwave-like configurations. Perhaps they are suggestive of the waves of subtleenergy created by the shape itself.SHALBOURNE, 2004Created by the partial intersection of two circles (or sets of concentricrings), this looks like the wave patterns generated in a still pool by twodroplets of water falling onto its surface.[images/Fig-219.jpg]Shalbourne, Wiltshire, England. August 2004. Approximately 200 feetALDBOURNE, 2005This seems to open a window upon what could be a larger pattern, the rest ofwhich is concealed from view. Geometrically, it is a combination of many narrowconcentric rings and a set of narrow lines running horizontally across them. Itis, in fact, a synergy of the circle and the line. Symbolically, this formationis particularly interesting; the circle is connected to one-ness and the line totwo-ness. The development from one to two brings about opposition, and we cansee from the pattern that each half is a mirror opposite of the other. Thiscircle seems to show this process at work.[images/Fig-220.jpg]Aldbourne, Wiltshire, England. July 2005. Wheat crop. Approximately 200 feet.SHALBOURNE, 2005This pattern is based on the superimposition of two sets of very narrowconcentric rings; the final effect looks like light shining off the surface of aflat disc. Perhaps all these formations are concerned with the relationshipbetween energy systems, shape and number.[images/Fig-221.jpg]Shalbourne, Wiltshire, England. August 2005.

However, it is true to saythat the Wiltshire area of the UK is the world centre for crop circles. With itsnumerous ancient sites, it seems that the circles feel most at home here. Manyreasons for this have been put forward over the years, among them, the chalkdownland, the underground aquifers, and a concentration of earth energies. Butperhaps what this part of the world offers is a synchronous combination of manyfactors.The designs of the crop circles seem to be culturally specific. Those of the USappear to be attracted to Native American sites and their designs are markedlydifferent in style and 'feel' from those of the UK. European formations, whilesimilar to those in the UK, also have a style and atmosphere of their own andare likewise often connected to megalithic sites.The number of circles that appear in other countries is difficult to calculatewith accuracy. In a huge country such as the US, many circles may appear eachyear never to be reported. Sometimes they are not discovered until the harvesteris upon them, and some farmers consider the crop circles an interminablenuisance, so deliberately neglect to mention them. In somewhere as large as theUS it would be quite an operation to set up a network of well-placed researchersto cover the whole country. In a small country such as the UK it becomes moremanageable. The best way to record the circles is to photograph them from theair, but once again the logistical problems, as well as the considerablefinancial cost involved, multiply considerably when operating on a larger scale.We have assembled a montage of circles from outside the UK, to give you a tasteof what is happening elsewhere.USA AND CANADAIt is clear from the images below how different crop circle designs are in theUS and Canada, compared to the UK. The huge formation in Fairfield, CA, was abeautiful design, perhaps another form of life. Its long tail was a line ofcircles that reached for a set of power cables. The Malden Township circle wasalmost totemistic, whilst the formation at Teton, Idaho, was based on theclassic Celtic cross patterns we are familiar with in the UK.Many of these patterns are similar to those which occurred in the early days ofthe phenomenon in the UK. However, it is interesting to note that the cropcircles happily appear in diverse crops, such as soya beans and maize, which aremore widely grown in the USA and Canada.[images/Fig-222.jpg]Fairfield, California, USA.

The wavy,meandering line is almost labyrinthine.The circle at Desenberg is based on 'curves of pursuit', something we have seenin England.At Thalheim, simple circular geometry created a criss-cross pattern around aninner circle.[images/Fig-231.jpg]Ehlen, near Kassel, Hessen, Germany.

Researchersremain divided over whether these circles are a natural phenomenon or if theymight be related to the crop circles. The ice seems to melt in a perfectlysymmetrical fashion, leaving a ring of water exposed. Ice circles are verybeautiful and ethereal and there have been several in Europe and the US.The circle at Ketelhaven, in the Netherlands, would not appear out of place inthe English countryside; the circles at Valkenburg and Vlijem Noord are simplerdesigns. It is a six-fold spinner with ribbon-like arms. The circle atValkenburg was a curving thought-bubble set, whilst the formation at VlijimNoord was classic pictogram design – a type often seen in the early 1990s in theUK.[images/Fig-235.jpg]Piteälven, near Älsbyn, Sweden.

People often say that cynicism is born of a broken heart, perhaps in thecase of the circles this is true. How many of us would truly love them to be theproof that we are not alone? Or confirm that we are in touch with somethingother than ourselves – a culture that might have wonderful things to teach us,wonderful stories to exchange. Perhaps we shouldn't be so dismissive of theseforbidden yearnings or so harsh on ourselves. Perhaps mankind is lonely. Afterall, he appears to have no one with whom to compare himself, no otherintelligent species with whom he can converse and share his wisdom, hopes,dreams, troubles and fears.The crop circles, however, do seem to speak a universal language; a universalphilosophy grounded in the archetypes that define our consciousness and thewhole of reality. The circles might then be accepted as a step towardsunderstanding and grasping that which could, one day, allow us to enter into ameaningful conversation with others, about matters beyond our own self-concern.More of this at the end of the book. But for now, prepare yourself to beastonished and maybe, just maybe, give yourself permission to dream a little.MILK HILL GALAXY, 2001The Milk Hill Galaxy spiral should go down in history as the most astonishingcrop circle of all time – so far. It appeared fully formed and perfectlyconstructed as the sun cast it first light over the hills of the Pewsey Vale inWiltshire. It had been a filthy August night, wet and windy, the result of humidsummer air meeting a colder weather front.The extent of this crop circle simply beggared belief. It was unfathomable atground level, and it was possible to stand in the formation and not be able tosee its end. One researcher described it as a giant confetti storm – a flurry ofcircles of all sizes, swept around whirlwind-like to create this beautifuldesign. Numbers came into play; most significantly, this formation iterated thenumber thirteen. There were thirteen circles in each of the six arms and also inthe total number of circles – 409 (4 + 0 + 9 = 13). This seemed a veryportentous event that spoke of change and transformation.[images/Fig-239.jpg]Milk Hill, Wiltshire, England. August 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 900 feetEerily, just weeks later, the world was transformed by the 11 September attacksin New York. It's extremely doubtful that the crop circles predicted this event,but perhaps there was a just a flicker of something looming in the globalunconscious, which was given expression by the appearance of this design.This said, many found this circle an inspiration and a sign of the highest orderthat the world was infinitely more complex than they had ever imagined.[images/Fig-240.jpg]Milk Hill, Wiltshire, England. August 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 900 feet[images/Fig-241.jpg]PICKED HILL, 2000The beautiful Picked Hill formation was immediately reminiscent of the patternfound at the centre of a sunflower. The central pattern of the sunflower isgenerated by the Golden Section spiral, although that was not the case with thisformation. The design derived from two sets of twenty-two spirals, oneclockwise, and the other anticlockwise – giving a total of forty-four spirals.In addition, the crossing spirals created fourteen concentric rings. Forty-fourover fourteen reduces to twenty-two over seven; we are more familiar with thisfraction expressed as the decimal 3.142 or 'Pi' (π), the formulaic number usedto calculate the circumference of a circle.[images/Fig-242.jpg]Picked Hill, Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England. August 2000. Wheat crop,approximately 250 feetYATESBURY, 2009This magical phoenix stunned all who saw it. The beautiful fluffy barley createdfantastic swirls and interior features, making this a truly masterfulcereological work of art. It was widely held that this phoenix signified anastronomical event of some kind, as on the 7 July 2009, nearly a month after itappeared, the formation was orientated directly towards sunset. What's morethere was a major solar storm on that day, creating a great deal of speculationas to whether the formation predicted the bad weather. Of course the phoenix hasmany symbolic associations, especially that of spiritual rebirth. In alchemy itsignifies the arrival of the philosophers stone – the ultimate mysticalmanifestation of spirit in matter.[images/Fig-243.jpg]Yatesbury (near Avebury), Wiltshire, England. June 2009. Barley crop,approximately 300 feetAVEBURY TRUSLOE, 2000This magnificent formation was undoubtedly associated with magnetic fields. Thepattern recalls the magnetic field revealed by the way iron filings line uparound a bar magnet. This is another example of how the crop circles seemconcerned with making visible the invisible forces and principles that underlieour reality. Geometrically speaking, a form of rotational symmetry seems to beat work, originating from the two flattened areas close to the centre of theformation. This kind of patterning is created by continually repeating a curveor line whilst simultaneously and sequentially moving around in a circle. It isyet another expression of the spinning and circular element so venerated by thecircle-makers.[images/Fig-244.jpg]Avebury Trusloe, Wiltshire, England. July 2000. Wheat crop, approximately 300feetWEST KENNETT, 2007This incredible circle was quickly named the 'Temple' or the 'Gateway'. It isone of only a handful of circles to use one-point projection. One-pointprojection was not seen in crop circle design until 2006 (see here[chapter_011.html#page_185]), and has only been seen in a few circles since.This type of geometry creates the illusion of three dimensions on atwo-dimensional plane by using a single point from which the rest of the imageemanates. That the circles are concerned with perspective and geometry is not inquestion, but this formation – and others like it – take the geometric design ofthe circles to a whole new level.[images/Fig-245.jpg]West Kennett, Wiltshire, England.

The tiny dark spotswithin the formation were birds on the ground; it seems apt that she should beaccompanied by feathered companions.The effect of this image on many of those who saw her was profound. They foundher deeply moving. Angels are divine messengers, figures of hope, love, graceand deliverance.[images/Fig-246.jpg]Great Shelford, Cambridge, England. July 2001. Wheat crop, approximately 180feetCHILBOLTON RADIO TELESCOPE, 2001The late summer of 2001 gave us two of the most unusual and controversial cropcircles yet. In a field beside the Chilbolton Radio Telescope in Hampshire, twocrop formations appeared that broke the mould in such a startling way that itwas difficult at first to equate them with what had become the accepted natureof the crop circle phenomenon.The first occurred on 14 August. It was a face inscribed into the crop using adot-matrix methodology. What met the visitor upon entering the formation was acriss-cross of standing circles of varying sizes in every direction. Like MilkHill, the ground experience proved fairly incomprehensible, but what wasfamiliar was the beautifully swept and swirled crop. The second formationappeared six days later. It was even more bizarre – an oblong area containing aseries of patterns and boxes. It was not long before it was recognized as arepresentation of the binary code first beamed into space from the AreciboTelescope on Puerto Rico in 1974; however there were a few modifications. The'message' apparently indicated that its creators were silicon-based and smallerthan ourselves; they also indicated that they inhabited a binary star system.What are we to make of this and exactly whose is the enigmatic face?[images/Fig-247.jpg]Chilbolton Radio Telescope, Hampshire, England.

The disc was found tocontain a form of binary code. It was a short message (a decoding appears below)that alluded to the hatred of deception and offered hope for mankind beforeabruptly ending. It was, in short, utterly bewildering. You might ask if thesetwo formations are any part of the same phenomenon that we have been discussing.Opinion is divided. Either they constitute a profound communication or they arenot what they appear to be. However, I do have to say that I have found thevarious reactions to this alien face extremely interesting; perhaps there issomething to be learned for each and every one of us in examining our reactionsto this highly provocative image.[images/Fig-250.jpg]Sparsholt, Hampshire, England.

Wheat crop, approximately 300feetBARBURY CASTLE, 2008This remarkable crop circle seems almost simple in comparison to many in thisfinal chapter, but don't be deceived. Concealed behind this seemingly simpleratchet design is the number for Pi (π). Pi is an irrational number (a numberwhose decimal places have no end) that we use for calculating the circumferenceof a circle. If you divide this crop circle into ten equal slices, the number3.141592654 is revealed. The small dot close to the central circle indicates thedecimal point. The diagram below, created by crop circle researcher and geometerMichael Glickman, gives a full visual explanation. Pi is an incredibly importantmathematical principle relating to circular geometry, so for it to appear as acrop circle seems remarkably apt.[images/Fig-253.jpg]© Michael Glickman, 2008[images/Fig-254.jpg]Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England.

Barley crop, approximately 300feetCROOKED SOLEY, 2002One of the most beautiful and transcendent crop circles of all time, the CrookedSoley formation contained a harmony and synergy of sacred geometry and numberthat was simply inspired.The picture you see here is one of a mere handful that exists of this circle. Itwas discovered by a pilot the morning it appeared, who alerted us to itspresence. Since it was already August and the summer had been hot, we knew thatit would not be long before the harvest, so time was of the essence and a flightwas arranged.As our helicopter approached Crooked Soley, the machinery was already in thefield with the farmer trying to wave away the aircraft, making it clear that hedid not want the formation to be seen. It was just a matter of hours before thecircle had been chewed up by his harvester; our pictures are now the only recordof this event, no other photographer was able to reach the location in time.The Crooked Soley formation contained a perpetual DNA helix and also included asquared-circle proportion. That man (or the human being) is himself a meetingpoint of Heaven and Earth seems to be implicitly at the heart of this design.[images/Fig-255.jpg]Crooked Soley, Berkshire, England. August 2002.

August 2004. Wheat crop, approximately 350feetSILBURY HILL, 2009This crop circle was immediately christened the 'Mayan Headdress' or the 'MayanMask'. Its possible links to Mayan prophecies surrounding the year 2012 werewidely discussed in the wake of its appearance. As a death-mask, this formationcontinues with the theme of transformation from the physical to the spiritual.As a feathered ritual headdress, it evokes images of shamanism and contact withspirits and worlds beyond.[images/Fig-256.jpg]Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England.

It was celebrated for its similarity to designs found in partsof the Ancient Mayan calendar.Twenty box-like structures form the perimeter of the pattern itself. Travellingtowards the centre, a series of standing rectangles seem to indicate some kindof coded information.This amazing formation was not the last to appear at Wayland's Smithy – therewas more to come.[images/Fig-258.jpg]Wayland's Smithy, Oxfordshire, England. August 2005. Wheat crop, approximately300 feetWAYLAND'S SMITHY, 2006This remarkable circle was christened – for obvious reasons – the 'Towers'. Itwas the first time we had seen one-point projection (geometry emanating from asingle point) used in crop circle design. One-point projection creates theillusion of three dimensions on a flat surface. The crop circles using geometryin this way seemed to be speaking of new and further dimensions. This was onlyone of several formations to appear in 2006 and beyond which addressed thistheme. The image of the towers was incredibly powerful and iconic, and many sawlinks to the events of 11 September 2001, a day that transformed the world.[images/Fig-259.jpg]Wayland's Smithy, Oxfordshire, England.

And with each newformation there is something fresh to contemplate and discuss. Perhaps the realwonder of the crop circles is the way the principles and ideas they embody havethe ability to change deeply the way people perceive the world. They constitutea remarkable challenge to our fundamental view of what reality really is.[images/Fig-260.jpg]Woolstone Hill, Oxfordshire, England. August 2005. Wheat crop, approximately 450feet[images/Fig-261.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE'EN-SOULING' THE WORLDENDINGSThe crop circles present us with a view of the world that is rich with meaningand metaphor; they make visible the very designs of matter and life. The spacesthey create are an invitation to come and take part in an exploration of theseuniversal structures; to recognize the connection of all things in the patternedfabric of creation. They also seem to suggest that these shapes and patterns arean intimate part of our own thought processes; and that they are an archetypalstructure upon which not only matter and life are based, but also lie at theheart of the structure of consciousness itself.That sense of familiarity the circles sometimes evoke – that uncanny feelingthat you know what these shapes are and what they mean, and that they aresomehow vitally important – make so much more sense when looked at from thisviewpoint.The circles seem concerned with rebalancing our world-view and our sense ofreality. In their own way, they are raising awareness of the fact that there ismeaning as well as function behind creation, and that life and everythingconcerned with it has an innate purpose. No matter how you feel that the cropcircles may have originated, they are bringing a richness and depth ofinspiration to the fore. They 'en-soul' our world and breathe life and colourinto the scientific machinery currently used to describe our universe. Thecircles seem to engender a view that such machinery is but the skeleton or barebones of the universe, and that what we now need to understand is the flesh, thelife-blood and heart of the wonderful creation around us.Is there more to this reality than we can currently see? A cursory glance overthe rich legacy of legend and myth held by our world's many cultures suggeststhat there is far more to our reality than we currently acknowledge in our mindsand hearts. The crop circles are our 'signs and wonders', our symbols andguides, our dreams and aspirations made manifest in the fields. They are acounterbalance to the mechanical and functional reality that the western worldpromulgates. They are mandalas of healing that have spread across the face ofthe earth; they are an unconscious expression of our need to re-order andreconsider. In our turbulent times, the human race is faced with many choicesand many dilemmas, and is being asked to re-evaluate its attitudes towardsnumerous issues, especially war and the environment. Perhaps the crop circlesare an outward sign that this process is firmly under way. Throughout this bookwe have looked at a whole gamut of components which may be behind the cropcircles. We have looked at earth energies, pizo-electrical effects, magneticeffects and the link between vibration and the formation of shape. We havelooked at the astonishing use of number symbolism encoded in the circles andwhat some of that might mean. There are many possibilities for the origins ofthe circles: earth spirits, extra-terrestrials, extra-dimensional intelligences,Gaia (the consciousness of the earth itself) or, of course, large-scaleinternational hoaxing.Whoever the circle-makers are it is clear they prefer anonymity; it seems to methat they wish to be known by the quality of the fruits of their labour; thecrop circles themselves. To be only interested in their identity, or the methodby which the circles are made, seems somehow crude in comparison with theelegant and thoughtful works of art they put before us. The crop circles haveresisted every attempt made to pin them down or explain them away, and afterover fifteen years of being close to this phenomenon I have come respect that.There will always be people who are more interested in probing the circlesscientifically, or those who want to spend their time with them building a caseto prove or disprove the hoax theory. I am, however, content to sit, watch thethe crop circles unfold and pay careful attention. The circles invite us on ajourney of mutual exploration; I have the sense that neither side knows where itwill end, but that the whole point of our interfacing is ultimately about thequality of the interaction.We began this book by searching for a state of focused openness, one in which wesuspended our world-view in the hope of gaining a better understanding of thebeautiful crop circles. I suggest that rather than giving up and grasping forany explanation of this amazing phenomenon, we strive to maintain our openness,and approach the circles with the patient attentiveness that their works of artso gracefully demand.Even if the mystery of the crop circles is never answered conclusively, theywill leave an enduring impact on those who took the time to observe them. Theywill have changed forever their view of life and reality. And for those who maycome long after the circles have disappeared, these pictures will serve as asnapshot of these difficult but hope-filled times.[images/Fig-262.jpg]Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England.
