T h at is to mv. thee are not. for the most part, hoaxes — although the scientific community and the media seem com m itted to convincing the public that they are. Linda Moulton Howe wastes no time recapitulating the notorious Doug and Dave episode. She dismisses it in a single paragraph an d gets on with exploring the complex, ongoing afterm ath. And what she finds is a common thematic and symbolic thread, plus em pirical evidence from scientific research that cannot be hoaxed.If you did n o t know crop circles were glyphs incised into fields of grain and knew them only as photographs, you m ight think they were paintings produced by a genius abstract artist educated in some universal mystery religion or esoteric school. The figures speak directly to our human aesthetic/spiritual faculty, as does all art. The language spoken is at once familiar and strange. The crop circles resonate within, sum m on­ing up echoes of the philosophical/m etaphysical/religious symbols used around the world since history began. Yet, rarely are they identical to what is known. Moreover, during the crop circle decades of the 1980s and 1990s, m ysterious balls o f lig h t or light form s have been seen ho ver­ing about the fo rm atio n s, som etim es ap p earin g on p h o to g rap h s an d videotapes. Even lights an d spheres invisible to the naked eye tu rn up on film an d tape.It’s difficult to avoid the feeling that the circles and the circle mak­ers, whoever or whatever they m ight be, are going to great lengths trying to tell us something. Possibly something im portant, and the inference is that the message m ust be positive since it runs counter-intuitive to associ­ate so m uch beauty and harm ony with negation. But what m ight that mes­sage be? And to what end? It is this positive aspect of the crop circle mys­tery that Linda M oulton Howe stresses while raising an im portant ques­tion about point and counter-point. The symbol glyphs often have penta- cles or geometries inside circles that suggest black and white magical rites. Could at least two players with different intents be com peting on the chessboards of the fields? Thoroughly, thoughtfully, sensitively, shevi"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"explores the innum erable resonances the circles set up with symbols we already know from the ancient traditions of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Islam, Christianity, Judaism , the Far East, and shamanic societies. Symbols spe­cific to none, rem iniscent of all. Remarkable! And then there are those lights! T he book is gorgeously and richly illustrated.As she weaves the symbols throughout the book with occasional near m atches in ancient texts, a central theme emerges: that there is no posi­tive force o r p h en om en o n without its negative counterpart: m atter/anti- matter, active/passive, initiating/resisting. There is no Horus without Seth. T h at is a cosmological/psychological/physical and strictly practical truth. In ancient Egypt, Seth (Setekh) was Ego, principle of materializa­tion and opposition, of negation, of m atter forever at war with Spirit. Seth is the Dark Force that does not want to return to the Source. Seth is also a great god. After prodigious contentions with Horus, Seth is eventually conquered and reconciled, not killed or even banished. Both Seth and H orus bless and em power Pharaoh, the Divinity incarnated upon earth. An alchemical text captures the final stage of that process: “The fire goes out only when the work is complete and the whole tinctorial mass fuses with the glass and becomes luminous like the sun.”W ithout Seth in opposition, nothing happens or can happen. Seth is easily understood, so it is odd that everywhere he is so grievously mis­understood. W hen I turn on my com puter in the morning, that blank screen is Seth, the Opposition, defying me to write words on it. We learn, all o f us, mainly through negation. Praise is comforting. It’s nice to be told that your work is admired. But the work is taken further largely through a recognition of the negative. If I do not know what’s wrong, or what is inadequate, I cannot improve it, fix it, surm ount it. Seth is always present — as he must be, should be — at least until the work is com ­p lete an d th a t “tin cto rial mass fuses with the glass and becom es lum i­nous like the su n ....”In the myth, H orus always conquers. In real life, it’s not always like that. In fact, for roughly the last four thousand years, the world has seen little of H orus, but a surfeit of Seth. In the myth, Seth takes many forms that have negative associations: scorpion, viper, crocodile, rampaging male hippo, jackass. Seth is also master of confusion, camouflage, decep­tion. So, it comes as no surprise when, in m odern time, he dons H orus’s own falcon mask o f Resurrection and Return and poses as today’s M essiah p re a c h in g his own gospel o f M aterialism and M eaninglessness.

And Linda Howe’s book is certainly a valu­able step in systematically approaching that problem .T h ere is som e reason for optimism. Despite the willful and deliber­ate m edia dismissal, the crop circles continue to show up regularly and on schedule every sum m er. So, whoever or whatever may be responsible for them is n o t discouraged. Maybe one lesson is that we sh ou ld n ’t be dis­cou rag ed eith e r by the perfectly predictable opposition o f the m edia and the scientific com m unity, n o r by our present inability to understand the origins a n d significance o f the crop circles.

The family wanted anonymity, but also wanted to u n d erstan d what was happening and welcomed research by Nancy T albott who organized a BLT Research Team: B for John Burke, researcher; L for W. C.

Later, she incorporated BLT as a non-profit foundation under her sole direction.Levengood has published over fifty scientific papers in peer- reviewed journals. He holds a dozen patents, including a seed analyzer. His crop form ation research began in 1991 after he received plants and soil at his private Michigan laboratory.

He watched it as it came closer and closer to a spot about 150 feet behind his house and just stopped. T he word he used was ‘hanging’ in the air.

I was thinking about Robbert's recent light encounters and a quote I had used in mv .-volume book Glimpses of Other Realities. Theoretical physicist, David Bohm, had contemplated the relationship between energy and mass and wrote, \"Mass is a phenom enon of connecting light rays which go back and forth, sort of freezing them into a pattern. So matter, as it were, is condensed or frozen light. ...You could say that when we come to light, we are coming to the fundamental activity in which existence has its ground, or at least coming close to it.” That’s what Albert Einstein’s famous formula E=mc2 was about. Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. If you put m on the left side of the equation, E moves to the right side over c2. Then it reads m =E/c2. Mass equals light and ener­gy. Or as Bohm put it, matter — you, me, the crops, the birds and the stars — are condensed or frozen light.Symbol \"lu ” in Old European script, 5300 - 4300 B. C.

Silbury Hill is the tallest artificial m o u n d in Europe, 130 feet high, built for purposes unknown. But 20th C entury researchers such as Moses B. Cotsworth from Yorkshire, England studied Egyptian pyramids and postulated that at least one Silbury Hill function was as a clock/cal­endar with a pole on top to cast shadow m arkers throu g h the seasons.Further. Professor Alexander Thom , C hair o f E ngineering Science at Oxford wrote a 1967 book entitled Megalithic Sites in Britain in which he showed how the stone and wood circles or henges o f Britain in the sec­ond millennium B. C. were aligned on certain stars. T hom also deter­mined that the ancient stone henges used a geom etry as sophisticated as later discoveries by Pythagoras. Thom said the an cien t stone circles were uniformly built on a unit of measure which he called a megalithic yard of 2.72 feet, or .829 meter. Thom was convinced m egalithic sites in Britain were calendars and clocks based on bright rising and setting stars.Thom said the ancient engineers built perhaps ten thousand mega­liths from one end of Britain to the o th er with g reat accuracy in align­ment.

Was there something about the specific geography, all those megalithic stone sites, that created a connection to the unseen that no human understood? Was there a specific co n nection to the Celts and their Druid priests and to the inspiring intellig en ce behind the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations? William Stukeley, a clergyman and Freemason, studied comparative religions an d wrote, “The plan on which Avebury was built is that sacred hierogram o f the Egyptians and other ancient nations, the circle and the snake.

Fontana says it “appears in the writings and prac­tices of magicians, and has strong associations with Hebrew mysticism: hence its appearance as the Star of David.” Jewish scholars have discov­ered that the origin of the woven hexagram symbol was probably Arabic.The upward-pointing triangle is equated with fire and masculine energy; the downward pointing triangle to water and fem inine energy. Fontana says, “The base of each triangle bisects the o th er ju st u nder the apex” forming two more symbols for air and earth. “The Seal therefore portrays the four elements, which are combined with the n um ber three (the triangle) to produce the magical num ber seven. However, as the Seal only has six points, the seventh is said to be invisible, representing the spiritual element of transformation, which emerges to the inner eye of the magician as he meditates upon the Seal.”18"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The very ancient Seal of Solomon, a six-pointed star formed by extending each of the sides of a regular hexagon into equilateral woven triangles, likely of Arabic origin.

Its characteristics are erratic. At some moments its pace is constant. But at others, it appears to flicker or reflect sunlight before slowing down and blinking out of sight. It then reappears, remains motionless, before repeating the same process in a random fashion as it passes through the crop, possibly even cutting a swathe on occasions. In a matter of some thirty seconds, it completes an entire circle, having crossed tractor tramlines at right angles and followed their course on other occasions, all without any possible indication as to the light’s origin.“Pulsing, flashing, flickering and shining are all words to describe this anomalous light which appears to bear a diameter of no more than eight to ten inches. To say the phenomenon seen is spherical would be inappropriate as it seemed to be more a light burst than a solid object.“At a distance of some 850 yards away, the flickering, pulsating light is seen to leave the wheat field, cross over a trackway and then enter a sec­ond field — this one in the process of being plowed out by a tractor.”Months later, Colin Andrews located the farmer who had been dri­ving the tractor. His name is Leon Besant. He described “a silver glinting light” about the “size of a beach ball” that was “flying around in the corn, on top of the corn.” Besant compared the light to tin foil blazing in the sun, “a constant glint. I couldn’t make it out. I don’t know what it was.”Japanese video experts who studied the tape said “the glinting object appeared to have no material substance other than as a pure source of light. In other words, on blinking out between flashes and bursts, the object ceased to exist.”Steve Alexander’s videotape sequence of the mysterious small light lasted about five minutes. Toward the end, it is difficult to see the moving object against the setting sunlight. For most of the time, it appeared to be no more than three to four feet off the ground at the level of the wheat heads. Steve reported that the light gained speed moving into a second field and “quickly crossed a third and final field before it began to climb the lower slopes of Clifford’s Hill, some 1250 yards (from Steve). It then ascended the fairly steep hill without any effort whatsoever, although by now its pulsations are becoming less obvious and less frequent. The phe­nomenon is then seen climbing the earthen henge that marks the bound­ary of Rybury Camp, the Neolithic encampment crowning the summit of Clifford’s Hill, exactly one mile from Milk Hill.”Janice Alexander was heard on the still running videotape to say, “It’s gone.

Nancy Talbott and another crop researcher, Geoffrey Stray, had also found some unusual wheat in the Avebury form ation in which the steins right below the wheat heads were rippled like Christmas candy and m others the leaves and stem right below the w heat h ead were twist­ed in a unique spiral.The same crimping and spiraling stem p h en o m en o n was found in wheat sampled from a Wh itefish, M ontana form ation discovered on August b. 1999. Levengood received samples from bo th Avebury and Whitefish and found biochemical and biophysical changes that he defines as “somatic developmental abnorm alities” which are discussed in Chapter 8 of this book. Perhaps his most surprising conclusion is that the energy that affected the plants and caused the developm ental abnormal­ities had to have interacted with the M ontana and Avebury fields at least two to three weeks before the formations occurred. Are fields pre-m arked and blue printed in some way? The issue of accelerated and retard ed growth is discussed further in Chapter 8.Scientific Evidence That Cannot Be H oaxedBiophysicist Levengood has analyzed thousands o f plants from crop formations in his own curiosity about what unusual energies are interact­ing with the plants to produce some of the biochem ical and biophysical changes he has confirmed in his laboratory. In his own words, he says that “a spinning plasma vortex with a microwave co m p o n en t and complex lower energy ion-electron pulses” have interacted with many formation plants he has studied.He also asserts that the energy interaction th a t creates form ations must occur rapidly, in a few seconds. O therw ise, he w ould find evi­dence of burning or charring from the microwave h eating . But he does not find such damage, and the form ation plants c o n tin u e to live and grow until harvest.Those biochemical and biophysical changes that Levengood has documented in thousands of plants from crop form ations include a com­bination of swollen and reoriented growth nodes, ru p tu re d growth nodes, metabolism changes in plant cells and m agnetic iron particles deposited over the plant surfaces and surrounding soil.34"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"W.

Getting into formations as soon as possible before public tram pling is always a challenge, so I hurried back to the car.When I drove past the 6-cube form ation and reached the top o f the next hill in the road, I could see on the left a d arkened area like a shad­ow on a beige patch of crop growing on the hill side. T he way to get up the hill without trampling through the oats was to walk along a dark green hedgerow that bordered the field. I was looking for a sty in the barbed wire. Those wooden steps would get me up one side o f the sharp38"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"wire and down die other. But I couldn’t find one and decided to climb to the top of the hill beneath a large grove of trees and see if I could get to the form ation from there. I wanted to enter as near the formation as I could to reduce walking in the growing oats.At the top of the hill, the crop was still fenced off by barbed wire. It was so h o t that I d id n ’t have a jacket with me to put over the sharp barbs. I tried pulling open a space between the middle wires, but they were too tight. W ithout som eone to help, I risked tearing my clothes and skin if I tried to climb, straddle and swing off the top wire. Then, I heard the swish of grass in the trees behind me and two women appeared. They had a windbreaker. We covered the sharp wire and the first person over received our cam eras and we followed.Stinging nettles and thistles stung and scratched my bare legs so much that it was a relief to finally move into the oats without knowing where we were going. The formation, it turned out, was much further below us on the hillside than it appeared from the road.At first I stood at the edge trying to understand what the pattern was and what the plants looked like without stepping on them. I prefer to first look at the plants through the zoom lens of my camera, looking for swollen nodes, burst nodes, reoriented nodes, single standing stalks or other anomalies. The two women went directly to the center and stood with their arm s outstretched and eyes closed in a kind of standing medi­tation. Centers are often damaged or completely destroyed early on by people who feel compelled to stand, sit or lay down on them.From my position at the outside edge of the downed oats, my first impression was how dishevelled the oats looked on the ground compared to the satin sheen that wheat can have as if laid down by rushing water, often in opposite directions, crisscrossing patterns, ninety degree angles and weavings like braided hair. The oats were rougher.W hen I was able to look at the crumpled center, there were six oat paths coming from the outer perim eter so that seed heads came togeth­er at a central point like spokes around the hub of a wheel.Half a dozen people were moving around in the formation, which was about 60 feet in diameter. Several men spoke German. One had a blue and white bandanna tied over his head. He was sketching on a notepad and I moved over to see his drawing.

Even the most archaic rock-scribings are geometrical in form. These hint at a notation- al and invocational system practiced by some ancient priesthood.

The great henge is sited on several im portant ley-lines, including on e which runs from St. Michael’s on top of the Glastonbury Tor all the way to a tumulus in Surrey. Stonehenge itself ... “shows a tendency towards a six­fold division (in the) discovery of an equilateral triangle with six-mile sides that links the microcosmic sixfold sacred geom etry with macrocos- mic landscape geometry.” Stonehenge’s groundplan even seems to be organized around an invisible hexagram. (See Page 93.)If Pennick is right, then which ancient intelligence u n dersto o d the magnetic grid of the earth and its relationship to geom etries on the plan­et and in the cosmos?While Andreas and I were talking, a n o th e r d ark-haired man approached and told me he had seen orange lights over the trees at the top of the hill the night before. Those lights, he said, were like the other ones he and his wife had watched at Silbury Hill the evening o f August 28th. That was the night of the big Avebury form ation with the six 3-D cubes in it.

I set up my audio recorder and the three of us talked about mysterious lights and crop formations.“A ball of light came right in front of me in a crop circle,” Charles said quietly. “That was pretty weird. I decided to spend the night in a large formation which was in a field of oil seed rape. The formation was spread out right below the Alton Barnes White Horse on the side of Milk Hill. Frances and a friend of ours decided that they would spend that night on the White Horse where they could view the whole landscape.”Oilseed rape, also known as canola, is an early spring crop in England. The stems are notorious for being full of water similar to celery stalks. No person can move through the plants without leaving a green trail. The yellow pollen and blue-white musk bloom get all over clothes and the thickly entangled branches and flowers make any movement through them difficult.“When did that rape seed formation arrive?” I asked.Frances picked up her large three-ringed binder of crop circle pho­tographs and drawings. “I’ve got a photo of it. Early May, I think. There were two in that field. First, there was a series of five circles. Charlie was in the second formation that appeared next to the circles.”That formation in which Charles Mallett had the light encounter appeared at Milk Hill near Alton Barnes on May 2, 1999. It looked like a delicate machine outlined in the dense, yellow flowers and, according to an eyewitness, was not there on the morning of May 2nd.

Is it connected to the “non-visible light balls” discussed in later chapters that have also shown up in numerous photographs after film has been developed and printed?Four nights later on July 28th, Charles and Frances stayed out in the fractal “ziggurat” across the road from Silbury Hill.Frances said, “I think it was 9:40 PM. We were sitting in the center of the form ation looking over towards Marlborough, so we had our backs to Avebury. And a light appeared over some trees — where you were in the flower form ation. You know those trees above the oats? Over there, this orange light ju st appeared out of nowhere and stayed quite still.“T hen we saw that it was doing very subtle movements.

They were very bright, obvious lights that were tangibly there. I watched them merge together and turn into a bright light and go o u t.”Frances added, “It sounds very much the same as a friend of mine, Nikki, saw with her brother. They came up from Barnstable last year (August 1998). The brother was completely skeptical. We took him to all sorts o f form ations and he just sat there bored. Both he and Nikki stayed up at A dam ’s Grave on the night that the Tawsmead Copse ‘Magnificent 7’ form ation went down. They saw lights that split into three — a red one and two white ones.

In m athem atics and Chaos Theory. this repeating triangular pattern is related to a Sierpinski Gasket. Sierpinski was a m athem atician who im agined shapes with the same bizarre qualities as the Koch Curve Snowflake.The Encyclopedia Britannica explains that a classic Sierpinski gasket starts with an equilateral triangle. Then it is divided three by three into nine equal triangles and the central one is removed.

Dr. Levengood found magnetic particles similar to others he has studied from England and Canada. Dr. Levengood concluded the formation soil had “remarkably uniform distributions of what appear to be iron micrometeorite material taken within and immediately outside the circle form ation.”Dr. L evengood rep o rted there was a “significant linear correla­tion in the relationship between the am ount of magnetite material in the soil and the distance from the observed epicenters of the sampled circles. This type of linear distribution was shown to agree with the fundam ental physics o f centrifugal forces on particles suspended in a rotating plasm a vortex system.”That means the am ount of magnetic material in the soil increased toward the circle perimeters.It’s true that meteoritic iron particles are found in soils all over the planet and m ight explain these anomalous findings independent of the form ation’s creation in the oats. But the uniform linear distribution of the iron consistent with “centrifugal forces on particles suspended in a rotating plasma vortex system” is not explained by meteors moving through the atm osphere and again raises the question: what is the ener­gy source for the hypothesized rotating plasma vortex?Nancy Talbott also pointed out there was a difference in the iron dis­tribution in two of the five circles. In two, the oats were laid out straight from the center point in a radial lay, not spiraled.“What we found,” Nancy told me in a radio interview, “was that the spiral circles revealed a disposition of this magnetic material that fits the centrifugal mathematical predictions of amounts that would be deposit­ed according to the laws of centrifugal force — more would be going to the perim eter of the circles. But in the radial lay, there were more parti­cles at the center and less at the perimeter.”That is consistent with the hypothesis that radial lays are produced by energy coming straight down into a center, while spinning plasma vor­tices impose a spiral lay throwing particles outward. The implication is that two different energy processes were involved in the creation of the Marion, New York oat formation in August 1997.i l lThe Barge"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Iron micrometeoritic material found in Marion, New York, pictogram.

The golden ball was encircled by a ring of flashing lights as it dis­appeared behind the trees. Then a flash of lightning leaped skywards which was m et by a downward flash. The following morning as harvesting started, the circles were discovered. This was after the batteries went dead on their farm vehicles.“When I went into one of the circle formations to photograph, I did not notice anything peculiar at the time. But when my film was devel­oped, I discovered the odd out of focus section in one of the frames I took of the wound up ‘nest’ at the center.

In Wilcot, The Golden Swan is a lovely English country house and pub surrounded by trees, flow­ers and pasture. There are only four or five rooms upstairs for bed and breakfast lodgers, but outside is a large grassy field away from the main house reserved for tents and trailer campers, similar to the camping pas­ture at The Barge.Jo hn and Alan had been coming to Wiltshire since 1991 to explore crop formations, had already been there several days and were ready to return to Essex when Roundway came down. When I knocked on their trailer door on August 2nd, John and Alan had not been up long. They reasoned that if the six-petalled flower at Avebury and the seven-armed “thron e” at Roundway both came down on Saturday morning, they had to stay up Saturday and Sunday nights to see what else might show up. But those nights had been quiet.I explained that at The Barge I had learned about their hearing a loud noise at Roundway that rem inded me of the snapping, crackling and popping sounds in Brentwood, Tennessee and Hoeven, Holland.I told Alan and Jo hn I reported for radio and asked if we could go to Roundway together for an interview at the spot where both had encountered the noise.

With us were Chad and Gwen Deetken from Vancouver, B. C., Canada, who have spent several summers in England since the crop mystery began.

(See Chapter 9.)In astronomy, the saros cycle is the interval of 18 years, 1 1 1 /3 days after which the Earth, Sun and Moon return to nearly the same relative positions and the cycle of lunar and solar eclipses begins to repeat itself. Each saros cycle contains about 43 solar and 28 lunar eclipses over a peri­od of 800 to 1200 years.Andreas had been reading a German astronomy book about the August 11, 1999 solar eclipse in Europe when he discovered a graphic of saros cycles drawn on a polar projection of the N orthern Hem isphere that rem inded him o f the Hackpen Hill formation.141Roundup and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Graphic depiction of a saros cycle of solar eclipses on the surface of the earth from Die Sonnenfinsternis am 11.

If the earth would be shown from behind, the spinning direction would fit.”While we were going over the saros cycle graphic and his surveys, a cell phone rang. It was Ulrich Kox who had been flying over the West Kennett Long Barrow and found a brand new formation. Andreas, his colleagues and I took off in a car caravan for the Long Barrow across the road from Silbury Hill.The West Kennett Long Barrow is a mound 330 feet long, one of the longest in the British Isles. Archaeologists speculate it was built around 3500 B.C. I had been in the entrance tunnel only the morning before wondering about the ancient intelligence that had constructed long bar- rows all over England and other parts of the world. Were they only burial chambers? O r could they serve other purposes that we have not yet dis­covered? Andreas would later tell us that the length of the new formation was 100 meters, or 328 feet, almost exactly the length of the West Kennett Long Barrow.Not only had I been at the Long Barrow the day before, I had tried to walk from there going west toward the “ziggurat” formation across the road from Silbury. There was one large unplowed field I struggled through and had started into the next wheat field when I realized that the ziggurat was much too far to reach that way. So, I had turned back to the Long Barrow and the road in front of Silbury Hill.Now, this new formation we were about to investigate was in the same wheat field where I had stopped. And I began to think about those odd blue lights the night before directly north of Woodborough Hill. Had those lights been over the West Kennett Long Barrow?As soon as we reached the downed wheat, we were impressed by its enormous size.

Finally, it seemed to move above the horizon. At that m om ent, I realized this is no police car! This is som ething very unique. Through my binoculars, I could see it wasn’t rising straight up. It was zigzagging like a sewing machine would go back and forth. And it pulsed very rapidly. Gwen and I counted the num ber of flashes in a m inute and it turned out to be about 2.5 flashes per second. Then it moved gradually east towards Avebury, still zigzagging.

As the m o m en t o f maxim um darkness began, a bright, stationary, reddish light ap p eared above the horizon to the southwest of our position about five miles away n ear Polean Farm and the village of Pelynt.“Using a H igh 8 video camera, Kris began taping the luminosity. Despite darkness an d overcast, we could see the light clearly. It was brighter than any o th er object in view at the time. Then as Kris attem pt­ed to zoom in on the first object with the camera momentarily out of focus, four m ore reddish lights appeared. Three lights were in a line with one below, perhaps a mile to the right of the first light. They looked iden­tical and we considered that they might be parachute flares. But we did not see smoke trails n o r could we see a floating, slow descent you nor­mally associate with flares.“Before Kris could refocus on the group of now five lights, the first luminosity d isappeared after m aintaining a stationary position for approximately 25 seconds. The four lights then remained in view for almost a m inute after the first before they, too, all vanished together.“Later when we viewed the tape a frame at a time, we noticed that the four lights ap p ear to flicker or pulsate a little, especially the luminos­ity in the top right co rn er of the group. When the tape is in slow motion, that light seems to disappear and reappear often. The sighting lasted approximately 1 m inute 20 seconds, of which we recorded about 1 minute 5 seconds.“Reviewing o u r experience and footage, we concluded that the red­dish lights were n ot airplanes, helicopters, balloons nor radio mast lights as there w eren’t any at the sighting area at the time. Though we cannot be totally sure they were not parachute flares, I question whether the mil­itary would have released large flares above public land, close to an ancient sacred site and a village at the mom ent of total solar eclipse.“For Kris and me, the luminosities appeared to be either what earth mysteries researchers call ‘earthlights,’ and ‘atmospheric plasmas’ some­times rep o rted as lum inous UFOs.

PC Pete Keene, training officer for Launceston police, who was watching the eclipse from high ground at Blisland said, ‘They were definitely parachute flares. I was able to see them fairly close up, but I can understand how people looking from a distance might have thought they were som ething else.’“At the request of the Cornish Guardian, both video­tapes showing the lights were scrutinized by Terry Hearn who operates a video editing suite in Roche and who has over 15 years experience of electronic imaging. ‘I careful­ly exam ined the tapes frame by frame and am 100 percent certain they show flares,’ he said. ‘In fact, I can even detect the smoke trails.’”Ed Sherwood is not so certain that the official explanation is correct because he has seen mysterious lights for years that are not military flares. He told me, “W hen I came to Wiltshire for the first time in 1992, very quickly I began to see light forms which I had not seen before. They seemed to be invisible to most other people and I began to think of them as non-physical em anations from another dimension or frequency. Then, on July 26, 1992, I witnessed non-physical light forms transform into a vis­ible and physical light over a wood, move across the wood and down into a wheat field and when we got to the location soon afterward, there was a new crop circle. So, I know from my experience that the lights have physical connections to the crop circles.”“Why did you go to Wiltshire?”“Basically, I was living up in Derbyshire more than a hundred miles away. And one day, I had a very strong clairvoyant impression that I must167"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"go down to Wiltshire, particularly to a location I d id n ’t know before. I looked at it on the map and it was a small wood n e a r Alton Barnes called Tawsmead Copse. I had this very strong im pression I had to go there because there was going to be a m ajor interactio n experience with the genuine circle making source and people. I ’ve h ad these kinds of impres­sions all through my life and I’ve learn ed to listen to them .“So. I jum p ed on a train the following day an d went straight to Wiltshire and put my tent right next to the trees at Tawsmead Copse. I learned that at least forty o th e r p eo p le w ere com in g to nearby Woodborough Hill on July 22nd for exp erim en ts by Steven Greer, M. D., for his Center for the Study o f E xtraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI). Some who came included Ron Russell, Shari Adam iak, G eorge Wingfield, Maria and Jo h n Ward, Michael H esem ann, Lynn Gladwyn, Reg Presley, Colin .Andrews and many others.“A few hours before the large g athering, I was standing alone in a wheat field. I’d had an ability for m any years to clairvoyantly sense the appearance of physical energy balls, o r what scientists would call ‘atmos­pheric plasmas.’ I asked the Infinite Intelligence an d Consciousness of God as a ‘clairvoyant m edium ’ to help in the g ro u p ’s effort to initiate interaction with the ‘Source’ or ‘Sources’ o f crop circle formations that were not made by humans.“Hours later around dusk I was on W oodborough Hill with the group about to arrive. I suddenly sensed an infinite ‘p resen ce’ above me. I looked up, and like an answer to my req u est for help, saw for the first time a fully materialized, 3-dim ensional-looking, pearly white, non-physi­cal ball of light. It glowed clearly visible for ab o u t th ree seconds before vanishing. During those seconds, I could see it was ab o u t a foot in diam­eter and perhaps ten to fifteen feet away. Colin Andrews and Maria Ward were standing next to me, b ut they did n o t see it. W ithin minutes after that, I began to see a flickering, brilliant white light in my peripheral vision that would suddenly appear, draw my atten tio n, then disappear as soon as I tried to look at it.“Reappearing every few m inutes o r so, this light was different from anything I had experienced before. It took a few times o f turning my head to look in vain before I fully realized the source o f the peripheral ‘light’ was external from my own consciousness. Suspecting it was the ‘Creator’ as the ‘Cosmic Jo ker,’ m anifesting psychokinetically to attract my attention like a poltergeist, th at only I could see at the time, I chal­lenged the Source inwardly an d tho u g h t, ‘OK, you’re playing with me,1 6 8"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"but if you can’t appear in the center of my vision, I’m not going to keep turning my head to look.’ The psycho-interactive response was immedi­ate. The very next luminosity appeared in the center of my vision. I thanked the Source and from that moment to the present day, I have seen non-physical luminosities every day, mostly this way.“During the second night of the CSETI experiment, I began to see non-physical light balls multiply and cluster over hills, trees and water sources. I noticed that ‘clustering’ light orbs would occur rapidly or slow­ly, last for a few seconds to several minutes and, depending on weather conditions, could transform into a physical luminosities which I think are atmospheric plasmas or ‘earthlights.’ These were visible to everyone pre­sent in an ordinary unaltered state of consciousness. Reg Presley filmed an ‘orange’ plasma from Woodborough Hill after I saw non-physical light balls, invisible to the group, cluster at the same location.“Four nights later on July 26, 1992 near West Stowell in Wiltshire, I was observing non-physical light orbs cluster above a small wood when they suddenly disappeared and were replaced by a large ball of orange light instead. Approximately 20-30 feet in diameter and visible to at least ten other people in two different locations, it remained stationary for about two minutes before descending into a wheat field where a new ringed crop circle form ation was found the following morning.”“Ed, what’s the difference for you between extraterrestrial vehicles that might have ETs in them and the intelligence or force associated with the light spheres?”“Well, for me the difference is that the intelligence behind the phys­ical energy balls which some call earth lights, atmospheric plasmas, or dragons — depending on the culture — is what I would call the Infinite Intelligence. It’s the intelligence of creation. Call it God, if you like, but definitely an intelligence that is infinite.“With the extraterrestrial vehicles, I always sense before I even see them that one is about to appear at a location in the landscape. I get a very strong feeling o f beings with individualized consciousness, personal­ity, ego, identity, individual life forms.“But the intelligence that I experience with these non-physical lumi­nosities and the physical luminosities that can transform from the non­physical is not a personality, but something infinite — something that can take on many forms and can easily reflect your own psyche. But intrinsi­cally, it is beyond form. It can take on a matter form on this planet, per­haps other planets throughout the universe, according to natural law.169Roundup and Beyond"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"“For exam ple, what I’ve le a rn e d over th e years studying crop cir­cles is that I n o ticed th e re seem ed to be a collective o f cosmic and e a rth forces, processes and co n d ition s th a t b rin g a b o u t g en u in e crop circle creation.

Plasma, which is a ball of ionized or electrified gasses, is b o un d by a powerful magnetic field. But if you have a strong gusting wind that will disperse that energy, the m agnetic field o f a plasma cannot overwhelm the m ore physical and powerful wind. So, I have never seen plasm a form ing u n d e r high wind conditions. I’ve also never seen it form in rain. I’ve seen it form either side of rain. High humidity is very im portant. T h ere can be fog, but not large raindrops falling. T he energies being electrical and particularly electrostatic plasma, if it comes in contact with liquid water, it loses its charge and will be absorbed by the water.”“Ed, why would an infinite consciousness need to interface at all throu g h water molecules in sphere shape?”“Yeah, it’s a good question. W hat I’m trying to say is that certain laws o r forces were set in m otion at the beginning o f this universe. What I’ve learn ed from research and experience is that the Infinite Intelligence, the Collective Intelligence, within all of creation — an d n o t just the cre­ation o f this universe, b u t all universes before it and all after — this U nquantifiable Intelligence manifests according to natural law. After that is set into m otion, the Infinite Intelligence does n o t go against that.“For exam ple, if the force of gravity on this planet is of a certain strength, the Infinite Intelligence does n o t say, ‘Ah, today, I think I’ll make it a h u n d re d times stronger.’ T hat m ight not be a problem for the Infinite Intelligence, but it would be a trem endous problem for us.“W hat I ’ve learned is we have a situation where we come from an Infinite Source and what we call our soul is infinite in its essence.

Lara Stefancin-Nelson’s camera had flash abili­ty, but she is not certain if it was activated for the early evening photo that shows the three spheres.For others who did not see lights at the time and yet light images ended up on prints, Nick Nicholson took daylight photographs in 1995 at Goodworth Clatford, in 1991 at Tawsmead Copse and in 1990 at Swafield. The early August afternoon that Michael Yudowitz photographed in the 1995 Roundway circle below the power lines, it was clear and sunny. In all four of those cases, there was no rain and no camera flashes. Lara took clear afternoon photographs at Goodworth Clatford in 1999 and neither of us used a flash in the bright afternoon sun at Liddington Castle dis­cussed in the next chapter.

A specimen was sent to Leeds University where it was tested for water content and found to have been a living tree in Roman times around A. D. 300. This suggests that the ground level at that period was approximately the same as the present bottom of the Well and that the water (in A.D. 300 and before) came out as a surface spring.“T he Well lid of w rought iron was designed by Frederick Bligh Bond, a sensitive who was the resident archaeologist of Glastonbury Abbey in the early 1900s. ...The two interlocking circles of the iron­work are an cien t in origin and the symbolism has been found as the basis for num ero u s earth works and structures throughout the world.

Why would Christ choose Glastonbury?Dobson writes, “T he reason may p erh ap s be found in Druidism. ...The basic D ruid belief was in a Trinity. It was n o t polytheistic. The Godhead was called Duw, the one w ithout darkness who pervaded the universe. T hree Golden Rays o f Light were the em blem o f Druidism, rep­resenting the three aspects or persons o f the Trinity em anating from the Godhead.

The monks evidently attached a great veneration to that stone. Did the feet of these holy beings nam ed ever tread this spot?”Lewis also writes, “Perhaps there is some truth in the strange tradi­tion which still lingers, n ot only am ong the hill folk of Somerset, but of Gloucestershire, and in the West of Ireland, that St. Joseph of Arimathea came to Britain first as a metal m erchant seeking tin from the Scillies and Cornwall, and lead, copper and other metals from the hills of Somerset, and that O u r Lord Himself came with him as a boy.”Lewis’s research confirm ed that the two earliest exhibits of Roman- British lead in the British Museum came from the Mendip Hill near Glastonbury. Early in the 20th Century, researchers were digging at Ostia, a Roman seaport, and found an ancient drain-pipe below the chariot road. “It was bond ed in some special way with tin. Professor Russell Forbes cut off a section and sent it home to England without comment for analysis. T he verdict was that the metal came from the Mendip mines. ... It is also said that in the wonderful aqueduct in Jerusalem, attributed to King Solomon, the particular type of lead found in the Mendips and nowhere else was used. This was 1000 B. C.”Lewis also quotes Q ueen Elizabeth I from a 1651 book as stating: “Joseph of A rim athea planted Christian Religion immediately after the Passion of Christ in this Realme.” Further, Lewis points out that Sir Robert Wingfield, H enry VIII’s Ambassador, recorded, “Immediately after the passion o f Christ, Joseph of Arimathea, the noble Decurio (rec-mVesica Piscis"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"ognized office in the Roman Empire in the time o f St. Joseph) ... imme­diately proceeded to cultivate the L ord’s Vineyard, that is to say, England, and converted the peoples to the Faith.” ...(Vineyard) is a curious name. Why should England be called the L ord’s Vineyard? O ne feels bound to record that on the south side of Weary All Hill, which is the traditional landing or resting place of St. Joseph and his eleven companions, is a piece of land still called the Vineyard.”The time line given for Jo sep h ’s move to G lastonbury varies, but 31 A.D. is the year used by Lionel Lewis. Rome invaded Britain in 43 A.D. to expand its territory and to eradicate the Druids. Lewis says that Joseph of Arimathea and ten companions traveled through Britain preaching about Christ and settled in the “Glassy Isle” assumed to be Glastonbury. Lewis writes, “After a very short time ... (they) were told in a vision by the Archangel St. Gabriel to build a church in a spot revealed to them in hon­our of the Blessed M other of God, the ever Virgin Mary. Obedient to the heavenly admonition, they compiled a certain chapel with circular walls of misted twigs in the thirty-first year after O u r L ord’s passion... .”Lewis also describes the Welsh trad itio n that “St. Joseph of Arimathea brought Christianity to Britain and is always called ‘Ilid.’ Why, has always been a puzzle. With diffidence I will suggest what may be a solution. The word Ilu is found at Babylon as the equivalent of the Hebrew Elohim, God. Jah-Elohim, and God, becomes Jaum-Ilu, Jacob, Joseph, Israel become Yakub-Ilu, Yasub-Ilu, Sar-Ili. On the stele of Manepta in Egypt, Israel becomes Isra-Ilu. Joseph or Yasub means ‘he who adds.’ Does the full name Joseph-Ilu therefore m ean ‘G od’s man who adds,’ ‘God’s rich m an,’ ‘God’s Joseph?’ In a strange land (Britain), the Yasub or Joseph might easily be dropped, and Ilid m ight well be a Welsh variant of Ilu or Ili. ”Lewis found old Roman descriptions by D iodorus Siculus who traveled to an island in what is now G reat Britain in 80 B. C. where “metal workers of Balerion o r Cornwall carried th e ir tin ‘to a certain island lying off the coast o f Britain called Ictis; for as the ground between is left dry at low tide they carry tin th e re in great abundance in their waggons. (If) G lastonbury is Ictis, the island where metal was brought for foreign export, it certainly gives su p p o rt to the story that St. Joseph came to G lastonbury as a m etal m e rch an t before he came there as a missionary, and would accou n t for friendly reception by King Arviragus (King A rth ur in G lastonbury?) an d the Druids, and for his choice of the spot there for his m ission.”mMysterious Lights and Crop Circles"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Construction of Glastonbury Abbey began around A.D. 63, perhaps inspired by Joseph of Arimathea, uncle of Christ's mother, Mary.

The technician told me they had been processed with a batch of other films which had come out perfectly all right and that he could not come up with any technical reasons for the presence of these anomalies.

He can only deduce that something from outside did make an impression on the films or that somehow some force affected the chemicals in the processing tank to precisely enhance certain localized areas on mv films only, a supposition that gave him goose pimples!“I use a Mamiya 645, a m iddle form at semi-professional camera. I use 220mm films (30 frames) ISO 100 which I buy from a shop that supplies professional photographers. These were new Fuji films bought just a few days before the appearance of the double form ation. I keep my films refrigerated (cold, not frozen) and they are sealed and in their original boxes. No one else has access to my films and I loaded the cam era myself just before flying. I have used the same camera, the same type of film and the same laboratory for the past two years. I take the aerial shots from a small helicopter especially designed for aerial pho­tography. I have taken hundreds of photographs in the same conditions and never had results like this. T he days the pho­tographs were taken were dry and sunny, elim inating the possi­bility of moisture on the lens.”A week later at 6 AM on Ju n e 19th, crop circle researcher Frank Laumen from Leverkusen, Germany and friends drove to Wiltshire and the East Field to see the rem arkable Sentence and Serpent formations. He said it had been clear and sunny until they reached “the border of Wiltshire. After that, we saw little because it was so foggy. The fog disap­peared very slowly, but at 8 AM we saw the large East Field formation. I was absolutely impressed! In the last years since 1997, the first year that I saw crop formations, I had hoped to see such a form ation. It was so spe­cial because it was a compilation o f designs over the past ten years.“I went into the form ation at 8:30 AM. It was overcast and every minute we thought it would start to rain. I took a lot of pictures, but I saw no anomalies. Between 9 and 10 AM, I m ade a lot o f pole shots with my still camera and videotape camera.

We were getting tired and about to leave when it happened. Two beams of light shot up from the middle of the field looking very much like wartime searchlights hunting for planes. The beams went up into the sky hundreds, if not thousands, of feet waving lazily to and fro.

This object was on the forest end of the East Field, so it’s above the road which runs there about a mile away.”“You were on top of Adam’s Grave watching and a mile away over the tree end of the East Field, the lights did a half circle?”“Yeah, that’s right.

And when it came more near to us and it flew in a half circle in front of us, the lights changed in some sort of way. I don’t know. Then it was two lights and then suddenly a third in a triangular shape. You can actually see it on video. But it has to do with the direction it flies and the angle you are looking at it, I think.

I’d com pare the size to som ebody’s head and that’s about the size of a soccer ball, I thin k .”“Could you tell how far away it was?”“Well, I think it would easily be 600 o r 700 m eters. You have the slopes of Woodborough Hill in the background. This light was ahead of the slopes, so I know exactly the distance. It can n o t be any further away than Woodborough Hill. And after ten seconds o r so, it got brighter and you could see it with the naked eye again. T h at took ab o u t two, three or four seconds, then it got less again, but it was still there.

The largest number was in Saskatchewan with ten, followed by four in Alberta, three in Ontario and one each in Q uebec, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia. Some were associated with odd light activity over the fields as well.By the first of July 2000 with so m uch o f th e su m m er yet to unfold, the phenomenon was more global than 1999.

He responded in the following letter.“In my opinion, it is no coincidence at all that Kassel became the German center for crop circle activities. It is indeed, next to Karlsruhe and Schleswig-Holstein (which are the other areas with frequent circles in our country), the land which comes closest to the sacred landscape design of the sanctuaries of Avebury and Stonehenge.“Kassel is also the birthplace of Rosicrucianism in the 17th Century and the center of Masonic activities in the 18th Century. In 1614, the Kassel printer Wilhelm Wessel published two books which became the ‘Bibles’ of Rosicrucianism: the anonymous General Reformation of the Whole World and the famous Fama Fraternitatis or the Discovery of the Commendable Order of the Rose Cross. It was written by Johann Valentin Andreae, son of a Lutheran priest with the reputation of being an alchemist, born and liv­ing near Tuebingen in Wuerttemberg.“One year later, Andreae published his second book Confessio Fraternitatis or Confessuin of the Commendable Brotherhood of the Venerable Rose Cross, Addressed to the Intellectuals of Europe, again in Kassel. The fact that Andreae spent all his life in Wuerttemberg, but published his books in Kassel/Hessen indicates that there was indeed a secret society already active at that time which coordinated the publication. With a very high probability, A ndreae’s friend, Rudolf August von Braunschweig- Wolfenbuettel, was another member of this Rosicrucian order. Its center of activities at that time was obviously already the city of Kassel.“M entioned for the first time in 913, Kassel obtained its town-rights by the end of the 12th Century when it became seat of a German chapter of the Knight Templars. Since 1277, it is the residence of the Counts of Hessen. At that time until 1848, Germany consisted of over a hundred independent states or counties ruled by Counts, Barons, Princes and Kings, united within the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. In 1527, Hessen introduced the Lutheran Reformation as one of the first German states. The Counts of Hessen were proud of their French ances­try, sharing with the Kings of France a remote descent from Pippin, the Short, the father of Charlemagne.“In 1717, the very year in which Freemasonry went public for the first time with the foundation of the Great Lodge of England in London, the Count of Hessen-Kassel, one of the first German Freemasons, com­pletely changed the design of his residential city, Kassel. With the help of141"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Italian architects, he designed it as ‘the city o f m a n ,’ a m odel of the human energy body with its seven chakras. For this, h e erected a network of fountains and monuments along a straight line, the city’s new axis, ending on top of a mountain. There, he erected an octagonal structure corresponding with the eight-petalled lotus o f the Buddhist m odel of the Kundalini, crowned by a structure which is half obelisk an d half pyramid, with a bronze statue of Hercules on top: th e God-M an of the Cheek Roman mythology leaning on his club. H ercules stands for the perfect man. Seen from below, the whole structure resem bles a Tibetan stupa. At his feet in the octagon, Count Hessen-Kassel placed the defeat­ed Chant Encelados, symbol for the ungodly ‘old m a n .’“Interestingly, Carl of Hessen-Kassel, who ru led from 1767 on, became one of the closest friends and disciples o f the mysterious alchemist, Comte du Saint Germain. A lthough H essen preferred to reside in Gottorf near Schleswig, the capital o f his land was Kassel. He hosted Saint Germain in the nearby castle o f L ouisenlund, where he allegedly died in 1784. In 1774, Carl o f Hessen-Kassel was received as a Freemason in the lodge at Schleswig. In 1782, he organized the first national conference of Freemasons in W ilhelm sbad n ear Kassel. ;“In conclusion, I can say that Kassel was G erm any’s m ost important center for Rosicrucianism with a ruling family deeply involved in alche­my, freemasonry and sacred landscape design. T h ere is a direct connec­tion between these ancient crafts and occult sciences an d ancient Egypt f as there is one between the stone tem ple o f Avebury with its Silbury Hill J pyramid and the land of the Pharaohs. T herefore, it does n o t seem to be I a coincidence that right here in Kassel the circle m akers fo u n d a second | field of activity.” jMichael Hesemann did not have a suggestion a b o u t why April 30 to May 1 should be the annual date the circle m akers have chosen for their > appearance near Kassel. But that repeating date is why the nightwatch group stayed out April 30, 2000 to watch the fields h o p in g to see the cre- mation of a formation. Janet Ossebaard told m e by p h o n e w hat happened. “At 2 AM all of a sudden, it becam e extrem ely dark. It was so weird!It was not like anything I’ve ever experienced before.

Normally there are many sounds at night. But there was no sound whatsoever!

There was no difference. We talked to each other. We were sort of whispering. It was so overwhelming and we had no idea what it was. The streetlights were gone. The villages were gone. The sound was gone. The cars on the motorway were gone. We were completely isolated from the rest of the world. And it felt very nice. It was a protected feeling.“It didn’t look like a mist, though, because at a certain moment there was a car driving right beneath where we were on a bit of a hill. And the car was pretty close. And we could see it very clearly and Bert said, ‘Hey, look at that! That is weird!’ All of a sudden we see this car, but there is no fog. We could see the headlights clearly. Yet, you couldn’t see any­thing else. As soon as the car was gone, everything was gone. It was like we were in a pitch black universe, floating. Really weird!“This happened from 2 AM to 2:15 AM.

He found nothing, the miners capped their dig hack up and two hundred thirty years later in the rainy spring of 2000, the cap finally gave way. At least, that was the official explanation while archaeol­ogists and engineers tried to figure out how to fill Silbury with hundreds of tons of new chalk. Helicopters were the easiest labor choice. Some local men went up the hill at night, got down inside the Silbury hole and said they found another eight foot square shaft angled off from the cen­tral hole. Whatever the origins of the shafts, such a difficult wound to repair after nearly six thousand years of Silbury’s steady strength was an unnerving omen midway through the last year of the 20th Century.Another strange aspect of the story were eyewitnesses, including Frances Mallett, who saw “a ball of deep yellow light hanging in the sky approximately 200 feet directly over Silbury Hill the night of June 1-2, 2000,” reported by Charles and Frances Mallett at the www.cropcircle- connector.com.

C. Levengood would agree with Frank Laumen that the energies which produce crop form ations com e from above. The for­mation that convinced him was Cherhill 1993, o r at least the nearby field where Peter Sorensen dragged a m agnet throu g h a circle. T he soil and wheat debris attracted to the m agnet were covered with a thin coating of iron oxide. He already knew that microwave frequencies were involved because his laboratory tests with microwaves sim ulated the anomalies of enlarged cell wall pits, lengthened and reo rien ted grow th nodes and expulsion cavities. All of these biophysical effects were caused by sudden and rapid heating of cytoplasmic constituents an d w ater in the nodes and much more efficiently than soup is heated in a microwave oven.He also suspected plasmas o f positively ch arg ed ions an d negatively charged electrons were the transport m echanism s for the microwaves and other complex electronic energies. Since the iron glaze was distributed like spray paint over the soil and plants, Levengood reasoned that the iron was in a liquid or semi-liquid state rotating inside a spinning plasma before it was deposited by centrifugal force in m ost cases.Many formations later, Levengood has d em o n strated in his research reports that high concentrations o f m elted iron beads are often distrib­uted in formation soils according to the laws o f centrifugal force and the empirical data have been shown to follow the centrifugal force theory with correlation coefficients > 0.9.Occasionally crop form ations are not spiraled. T h e crop is laid straight out radially like spokes in a bicycle wheel. In those formations, unusual concentrations of iron particles have been fo u n d in the center where energies apparently focused straight downward. An example is Marion, New York in 1997 discussed in C h ap ter 3.148Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"By the summer of 2000, Levengood had studied plants from at least three hundred formations in Israel, Australia, Canada, the United States, England and Holland. He found a repeating pattern of biochemical and biophysical changes in formation plants and magnetic anomalies in soils which lead him to conclude that what was interacting with crop formation plants and soil was “a spinning plasma vortex.” But what was creating the vortices?He has described his research in scholarly papers published by the international plant physiology journal, Physiologia Plantarum, and the American Journal of Scientific Exploration. So far, no one has refuted his hypothesis that spinning plasma vortices containing microwaves, magnet­ic fields and electric fields produced by charge separation in plasma form the complex energy systems that create the crop formations. Levengood does not know the source of the vortices, but has hypothesized that the origination of the plasmas begins in the ionosphere or higher through complex interactions involving cosmic rays and streams of high energy solar particles.In a 1995 paper entitled “Semi-Molten Meteoric Iron Associated with A Crop Formation” published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration (V o l. 9 , N o . 2 , P a g e s 1 9 1 - 1 9 9 ) , Levengood and his research colleague, John Burke, wrote: “Out of a four year investigation of plant tissues taken from over eighty crop formations, located within five countries, we report data from a single sample set which indicates a ‘close encounter,’ between the complex forces producing these flattened, circular type formations and meteoric material from the atmosphere.“Both soil chunks and plant tissue taken from specific regions with­in a 1993 wheat crop formation in Cherhill, Wiltshire, England, exhibit­ed a high degree of magnetic susceptibility which originated within adherent coatings consisting of the commingled iron oxides, hematite (Fe2O 3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) fused into a heterogeneous mass, and having the properties of a ‘magnetic glaze.’ The makeup of this material appears to be of meteoric origin and apparently impacted the ground while in the semi-molten state. Presence of meteoric material adhering to both soil and plant tissues, casts considerable doubt on this being an arti­ficially prepared or ‘hoaxed’ formation.1 4 9"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Heterogeneous mixture of the iron oxides, hematite and magnetite on outer surface of wheat leaf found in Cherhill, Wiltshire, England, 1993.

He wrote, “In Cherhill, England, the meteoric dust was confined to separate smaller swirls within the larger swirls. Meteor trails are so highly ionized that they can be detected by radar (DeAngelis, 1988) and used to enhance radio communications. The structure of these ionized trails is still not well understood, but known to be turbulent (Gibbs, 1983). Plasma processes are commonly seen in the ionosphere within the aurora, many of which are spiral. In fact, the rays of the common aurora are now known to be tight vortices viewed from the side (Hallinan, 1981). While the full scale of an aurora is vastly larger than a 15 meter crop circle, the thickness is often little more than 100 meters.“In plasmas, the magnetic pinch effect (of magnetic fields on plas­mas) tends to concentrate the plasma into progressively tighter helical structures. As the overall width of the helix decreases, the local, induced magnetic field increases (Rose and Clark, 1960). Thus, if it were plasma vortices that impacted the English wheat field, the 0.5 m eter sub-vortices would likely have had stronger magnetic fields than the 15 m eter vortex of which it was a part. These smaller, high field strength regions could, by a process of plasma convection and chemical separation (Marklund, 1979), form discreet filaments containing the highly magnetic iron dust. Microwaves produced by the electrons rotating in their helical paths would heat any iron particles present and in air would also oxidize a por­tion to the hematite form. Internal heating may explain why the hematite-magnetite mixture was still semi-rigid on impact. Normally such droplets congeal in the air and reach the surface as independent spherules without plating the ground.“Spiral auroras commonly contain arcs which have been seen to evolve into pairs of counterclockwise vortex sheets (arrays of vortices) that are never stable and never unwind. This compares well with the two, 15 meter counterclockwise spiraled areas in the wheat, with their atten­dant sub-vortices. Helical auroras originate in spiral electric fields of the magnetosphere and map down along geomagnetic field lines into the ionosphere (Hallinan, 1981).”Levengood asked, “Is it possible that a pair of these downward direct­ed, counterclockwise plasma vortices intersected and captured meteoric dust along the way, which in turn, was maintained o r heated back to a semi-molten state by the microwaves of sub-vortices which carried it to the ground with its subsequent crop flattening energies? If so, this would indi­cate a heretofore unknown phenomenon of ionospheric plasma vortices descending to the Earth’s surface. (Howe’s emphasis.) Whatever the primary152Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"origin, the evidence clearly indicates that meteoric dust impacted the ground while in a semi-molten state and was confined to multiple, tight vortices within flattened wheat formations.”Since his Cherhill paper, Levengood has found high concentrations of magnetic iron in many other crop formations, occasionally more than 700 times higher concentrations than the normal 0.4 milligrams of mag­netite per gram of soil. Soil samples continue to confirm distribution by centrifugal spinning force.Plasmas are distinctly different from solids, liquids and gases and are sometimes called “fourth states of matter.” Well known natural states of plasma on earth are lightning bolts, flames, auroras and gaseous neon lamps. Yet, scientists have estimated that more than 99% of matter in the universe exists in the plasma state. Stars and our sun consist of plasma.Plasmas are defined as a collection of electrically charged particles produced when atoms and molecules of matter are heated and release a soup of positively and negatively charged ions, electrons, neutral atoms and molecules, and photons. Physicists talk about high energy and low energy plasmas. High energy plasmas are produced at high temperatures. Low energy plasmas can form at room temperatures. Levengood says that low energy plasmas occur when the electromagnetic charges become the primary determinant of molecular behavior. Low energy plasmas, he thinks, are involved in crop circle formations.The light energy of photons are continuously produced and absorbed in plasmas so that lightning, auroras, fire and lamps glow. Another phenom enon known as “ball lightning” occurs as luminous spheres moving several inches in diameter near the ground during thun­derstorms which emit a hissing sound and distinct odor. However, ball lightning usually lasts only a few seconds and dies out suddenly, either silently or explosively. For more details and rare photographs of ball light­ning, see “The Persistent Enigma of Ball Lightning” in this chapter.Biophysicist Levengood thinks low energy plasmas could explain the mysterious lights photographed in and around crop formations and sacred stone circles and dolmens. He thinks the reason could be electric and mag­netic field anomalies at sacred sites which enable plasma creation.This link was brought to my attention at Levengood’s Michigan lab­oratory in May 2000. As he and I went through the images for this book,/ Levengood stopped at the Roundway photograph of Gordan Stewart sit­ting in the form ation’s center on August 1, 1999 with an unexpected arch of white light nearly obliterating his image.

My battery- operated camera repeatedly tailed to function there, although it would function properly when I drove ten m inutes away to buy a new battery. I was impressed, but since I had seen such cam era an d electrostatic volt­meter failures at other ancient sites, I was n o t surprised. T h e reason I was studying these chambers, hundreds o f which d o t New England, was the fact that other scientists had repeatedly m apped m agnetic anomalies at the spots chosen for some of these unexplained stone structures and I had been able to confirm this pattern at o th er sites as well.‘‘American archaeologists do n o t know w hat to m ake o f these structures, despite the fact that they are identical to h u n d re d s of oth­ers in Western Europe and elsewhere an d m atch th e category profes­sionally referred to as ‘d o lm en ,’ which W ebster’s D ictio n ary defines as ‘any prehistoric megalithic stru c tu re co n sistin g o f two or more upright stones with a capstone, typically fo rm in g a ch am b e r.’ Radio carbon dating in several New E ngland locations has revealed con­struction dates anywhere from a few cen tu rie s ago back to at least 1,200 A.

As it tu rn s o u t, m o re than one study shows that even m odern peo p le can freq u en tly feel such differ­ences under the right conditions. So, w hatever th e p u rp o se was for the Native American builders to co n stru ct m o u n d s a n d d o lm en s, electro­magnetic energy certainly played a cen tral ro le .”I asked Levengood and Jo hn Burke why both photographs have a similar anomaly that was not seen visibly at the tim e in eith e r England or New York. They responded,“Low energy plasmas are found th ro u g h o u t N ature and by defini­tion do not emit enough light on their own to glow sufficiently for the human eye to see. Though invisible, their existence can be confirmed with instruments such as the electrostatic voltm eter which measured the site of the arch in the dolmen photograph at Kent Cliffs, New York.“Another example of invisible plasma is the colum n o f previously ionized air which a lightning bolt follows in a zigzag p attern . When the energy of a camera’s flash is added to a weak, invisible plasm a, that ener­gy briefly moves the plasma’s electrons in the o u ter shells o f its molecules into a higher energy state. Those m olecules alm ost instantly drop back down to their original energy state and em it added energy along the way in the form of light.2 5 6"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"“A camera can record that light, but the speed at which it happens is usually, although not always, too fast for the human eye and brain to register. Thus, the photographer and people present see nothing, but the event is recorded on film or videotape.“Lightning, for example, is a more powerful, longer-lived version of the same phenom enon. With lightning, instead of the flash bulb, it is the release of massive electrical charge through the initially invisible plasma column that produces the same rise and fall of energy levels. We see a lightning bolt because it is more powerful, longer in duration and our eyes and brain can absorb the intense light.“Recent work with lasers and high intensity, non-coherent light sources has demonstrated that low energy non-visible plasmas can be readily stimulated to produce very intense pulses of photons which are very brief (in the nanosecond range) and peak in a different part of the spectrum (different color) than the stimulating energy. These studies clearly suggest that other light sources such as sunlight could produce high intensity emission in organized low energy plasmas. In fact, some well organized plasmas are seen in photographs taken without a flash.“With camera flash stimulation other Native American sites, we have recorded many balls of plasma that did not show up on non-flash pho­tographs taken at the same time. These were most common when the electrostatic charge in the air was high and measurable. In other cases, infrared photos without a flash have recorded balls of light which were not visible to the human eye at the time. We conclude that energy is pre­sent which registers as heat and electric charge, which can show up on flash photographs, but is not usually visible to the human eye.“As with any natural phenom enon, these events are part of a spec­trum . Unlike m anufactured systems, Nature usually works in a range of possibilities within parameters of natural law. At the outer edges of that spectrum are exceptions which occur less often. In one case, the light em itted after the plasma was stimulated by the cam era’s flash lasted long enough for the photographer to see. In more rare cases, the plasma appeared on photographs taken without a flash, but were not seen by the photographer. We hypothesize that this might be the result of extremely brief pulses of light emitted by the plasma itself — too briefly for the hum an eye and brain to register, but long enough for film and videotape to record.”1 5 7"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"In one of Levengood's English case files, he had photographs of stretched and reoriented growth nodes and expulsion cavities found in the wheat formation at Stanton St. Bernard on June 22, 1999. He stressed that “the energy causing node expansion appears to have microwave com­ponents whereas the energy inducing growth enhancem ent in the seeds has electrophoretic properties.” Electrophoresis is the m otion o f charged particles, especially colloidal particles, through a relatively stationary liq­uid under the influence of an applied electric field.Stanton St. Bernard, Wiltshire, formation discovered June 22, 1999, in wheat field. Apical upper nodes were lengthened and reoriented. Penultimate nodes further down the stems had expulsion cavities. Both effects have been simulated by Levengood by putting control plants in microwave ovens for a few seconds. Photograph © 1999 by W. C.

J o h n and I have found that when there is a drought, the plants grown from our experim ental seeds d o n ’t wilt as much or as fast. T he plants are resistant to drought. They can also last longer without light. T he biochem istry of the plants have been changed to a much higher efficiency level.”I asked him, “W hat changed to make them such super plants?”“The application of the plasma energy that we call ‘ion-electron avalanches’ stimulates the plants to produce a different biochem ical sys-258Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"tern. We have found through chemical tests at outside laboratories that our plants have much higher levels of antioxidants. I have a theory about how these ion electrons form and interact with the plants.”“But what is it about the ion-electron avalanche from the plasma that would effect plant cell metabolism?”“L et’s take seeds because we’ve got them worked out to a much finer degree. Seeds are living organisms. When the pulsing electric energies hit the seeds, or the plasma itself interacts with the plants, free radicals are produced that are destructive. But the plants try to co unter the free radicals by producing more antioxidants. To produce antioxidants in reaction to the tremendous pulse of free radicals dur­ing the crop form ation creation goes way back to my studies of ion transport in stems of plants and the effect of electric fields on them. Those are my redox tests of plant cell metabolism. What we’ve found is new stuff. You can’t go to text books to find this.“Another interesting discovery we’ve made is that if seeds that have been hit by free radicals are planted right away, they are practically dead. But if we wait several months, the plants end up more vigorous.” “Because the antioxidants have been at work?”“I think it’s in the genetic programming of plants. It takes time to turn on the antioxidants to neutralize the free radicals from those ion- electron pulses. But once antioxidant production is over-stimulated, we see this terrific vigor in growth, health and ability to sustain drought, lack of light and other stresses.”In a recent grass form ation discovered in Madera, California on M arch 27, 2000, Levengood perform ed his redox tests of plant m etabolism in grass from the center of a circle and grass sampled from the fo rm atio n ’s edge.“The redox test came out about what I expected,” Levengood said. “The controls had the normal level of respiration and the other two from the formation were anomalous. After those tests, I put all the plants back in a tight box, completely dark, for a week. After eight days, I decided I did n ’t need them for anymore work and opened the box to throw them out. I could not believe what I was looking at. The control plants were yel­low and brown, dying, as you would expect.

For this book, I researched some scientific papers and journal arti­cles to learn more about the illusive and controversial glowing balls. Some scientists argue there is no evidence that ball lightning exists. Yet, other scientists such as meteorologists and atmospheric physicists have reported seeing such a glowing sphere.Most ball lightning reports are associated directly with thunder­storm s, a w eather condition not present at the time of most mysteri­ous lights and spheres images in this book. However, I think it’s valu­able to com pare images in previous chapters with two photographs I have been able to obtain of ball lightning that have been published in credible scientific literature.T h e P e r s i s t e n t E n i g m a o f B a l l L i g h t n i n gPhotograph taken by eyewitness of round glowing head and trailing rays sometimes reported as a characteristic of ball lightning.

Another scientist who took notice early on was Dr. Gerald Hawkins, astronom er and mathematician.

The confidence level in what I found was, by statistical analysis, better than 99%. So, the circle makers of that period knew about diatonic , or music al ratios!“From 1988 onwards, we began to see geometries. I defined the se- as unem bellished, rotationally symmetric diagrams based on four theorems. Circles were placed so that if a tangent were drawn between them, they m ade the theorem . But these creations were new mathematics — follow­ing on from where Euclid left off and not to be found in modern text books. Each one gave diatonic ratios corresponding to notes in the octave, C D E F G A B. The geometries are shown on page 275. For those who are visually-minded, the theorems are based on simple geometric shapes, with o uter and inner concentric circles.“For the mathematically-minded, the areas of the circles give whole n u m b er ratios. With regular polygons, only the triangle, square and hexa­gon give diatonic ratios and only these shapes were used by the circle makers in the formative period ending in 1993. In the triangle, the area o f the o u ter circle divided by the inner is 4, and the annular ring gives 3. In the square, the ratio is 2 and the hexagon is 4/3.“For the musically-minded, those numbers give C (3) in the third octave, G (2), C (2) and First octave F.“Thus, three points on the circle makers’ intellectual profile seemed to be visual, m athem atical and musical. Science News editors were intrigued by the new math and ran an article on my findings in 1992. I had also found a fifth theorem not in Euclid or the text books, which was the starting po in t for the other four. I wondered if the unidentified hoax­ers also knew this, so I kept it to myself. Science News readers wrote letters trying to guess it, but none succeeded. Then the fifty thousand mathe­matical readers of the Mathematics Teacher were thrown the challenge, but again n o ne succeeded.“W hether or n ot the circle designers read those magazines is a moot question because they did show knowledge of the fifth theorem in the so- called Celtic Tore at Litchfield in July 1995. After that, with the fifth the­orem o ut in the open, Science News went ahead and published it. Then in 1999, the magazine migrated it for posterity onto their CD-ROM.1 7 7"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Theorem V geometry behind Litchfield, England wheat formation.

The fifth theorem stated that when a triangle is drawn with the sides touching con- centric circles, then as the triangle changes shape, the areas of the circles make the ratios of musical intervals. When the triangle is isosceles with two sides equal, it will generate the square and hexagon by rotation.“T h e fifth theorem is unusual because the diagram moves, puls­ing in a n d o u t, ch anging shape as on a com puter screen. O ne could call this a n o th e r p o in t on the intellectual profile: ‘A ppreciation of m ath em atical n iceties.’“In the Litchfield formation, the designers used eight equally spaced rings. I proved that eight rings are needed before a diatonic triangle is possible and the base of this triangle touches ring seven and the sides ring two. It can hardly be a coincidence that tangents to ring seven intersect exactly on the outer ring, the Tore neckband. This 200-foot formation was accurately surveyed, and the geometry fit to within inches.“I analyzed all geometries occurring in England from 1988 to 1993. All nine of them contained a pair of diatonic ratios. Linda Moulton Howe published some in Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume I: Facts & Eyewitnesses. Ray Cox gave an update in the CCCS Circular No. 35, 1999. Doug and Dave said they made circles ‘for a laugh,’ so we could not match the intel­lectual profile with those two hoaxers. Why were the unidentified circle makers giving musical notes? Was it a code?“It was n ot unusual for musicians to encode messages in their com­positions. Bach and Shostakovich did it using German keyboard notation, an d Schum ann went so far as to put the name of his paramour, Countess Abegg, into his very first Opus.“T he learning curve took us to English church organ keyboards and to a list. T he first full octave in these church organs starts with note C, and the next keys have the letters DEFGAB. We can continue up the scales with the full alphabet, as shown in Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume I: Facts & Eyewitnesses, similar to the Boethean notation used around 500 A.D.“Background inform ation led me to see that the pairs of notes in the g eo m etries spelled o u t the initials of seven persons on a short list: th e first twenty-five p residents of the London Society for Psychical R esearch , th e SPR.

The corresponding geometries were: C orham pton ‘88; W interbourne Stoke ‘89; Longwood Estate ‘90; Som pting ‘92; Fordham Place ‘90: Oliver’s Castle ‘92; Etchilhampton ‘93; U ffington W hite Horse and Hog's Back Hill ‘93.“What is the probability of this happening by chance? W ith 26 letters in the alphabet, there are 1/2x26x27 possible pairs o f initials, AA, AB, AC and so on. So, the probability of any one random pair hitting any one of the 25 names on the list is 25/(1/2x26x27) = 0.071. T h ere are nine geometries with nine hits. By B ernoulli’s binom ial theorem , the proba­bility that this was intended is a very high 1.7 billion-to-one in favor.“Take twenty-five names in sequence from any list, anywhere in the world, and the odds are it will not fit all those pairs o f initials. I myself did not find the pairs and then search high and low for a fit. N or was this like finding names by skipping through the letters o f the Torah. T he target list is very short. There is no room to wriggle.“Scientists are persuaded by data that repeats. T he code appeared in 1988-91 and was confirm ed in the fields in 1992-1993. Ivars Peterson, author of the Mathematical Tourist, rem arked to me how on e could put aside arguments about statistics and look at the over-all credibility of the result. The list is not, say, a Little League team o f South Succotash. It is a London list, set in the English countryside. English ch u rch bells are dia­tonic — no sharps or flats — and keyboard codes are p art o f the musical repertoire. Jo hann Bach m em orialized his own nam e by p u tting B-A-C-H in the last fugue he wrote. For some reason, the circle m akers were memorializing those m en o f letters.“Even though my work is straight scientific research, it has been dif­ficult to budge my colleagues. Perhaps they fear to tread into a subject beclouded with fringe speculations, o r perhaps their background is not broad enough. O r perhaps, as on e such colleague said to me, ‘I don’t understand it, and therefore, I ’m n o t interested .’“As a professional scientist, let it be known I am n o t invoking the spirits of those celebrated persons. No, I only p o in t o u t that the names are being memorialized. In a way, what they stood for has been revisited.“For me, there is a decided break p o in t after the 1993 crop circle sea­son.

None were convincingly claimed to be the work of hoaxers. Nor did those few hoaxers show any interest in what I had found. After 1993, details of my work had been published and made available to the burgeoning groups. Simply to reproduce in wheat fields what had already been published would show us that these groups were up-to-date on reading the literature, but nothing more.“Fortunately, no latter-day hoaxers could alter what took place in the formative period of 1981-1993. That data was safely sealed in a time cap­sule, beyond challenge. From my point of view, like the astronomy at Stonehenge which was set in stone, the mind behind the phenomenon was in the record, set in the wheat.“Since 1993, there has been a tremendous amount of embellish­ment, but basic geometry is often a framework of the design. I have worked on a few formations that were brought to my attention as poten­tially significant. The formation at the West Kennett Long Barrow in August 1999 used the rule for satellite circles, though here it was satellites in the form of squares which repeated ‘HS,’ for Henry Sidgwick. The six yellow crescents at Barbury Castle in 1997 yielded, by Ptolemy’s theorem of chords, the initials of Frederic Myers, an eighth president on the SPR short list, and pioneer in telepathy.“At the end of a lecture I’m often asked: ‘Well, Professor Hawkins, after ten years of research, what have you proved?’“I say: ‘Because there is an intellectual profile, I have proved crop circles can’t be a natural phenomenon like whirlwinds, lightning or unguided plasmas. Furthermore, that profile is unique, touching the his­tory of mathematics from Euclid to fractals and music from Pythagoras to English church bells.’‘OK, Dr. Hawkins, so what is your opinion?’“My reply is open-m inded: ‘If all the crop patterns are made by hoaxers, then they should stop damaging our food supply. Clever m ath and musical codes should be published in the literature, not in the w heat fields.‘If the patterns are made by aliens arriving here in UFOs, then these extraterrestrials should stop giving us back our terrestrial information like the initials of famous but long-forgotten people of the Titanic era.‘If the phenom enon is transcendental, our culture is not currently prepared to face such a possibility; but if it is transcendental, then future society is in for a profound shock.’”1 8 1"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"91999 Crop Formation Surveys by Andreas MuellerThere have been m ore than a thousand crop form ations in southern England alone since 1989.

He has examined more than two h undred crop form ations since 1994, the year he began to locus on the mystery.

He chose crop circles, to study both their beauty and the provocative nature of their source. In 1994, Andreas founded I.C.C.A., The International Crop Circle Archive. I.C.C.A. has become one of the world’s most complete and extensive data­bases on the subject of crop formations. It includes over three thousand different form ation events that have been reported in at least forty-five countries over the past five centuries.O ne night at the Barge in Alton Barnes, Andreas talked to me about his perceptions of the crop mystery.“W hen I first arrived here in W iltshire, I realized th a t th e re are such b eau tifu l p atte rn s, and the whole p h en o m en o n going on an d m ost p eo p le d o n ’t realize it.

It was about m idnight. I glimpsed in the corner of my eye a light was moving very far away. And when I looked, I realized it was moving in my direction. I need to add that the house of my parents is in the countryside with meadows and horses. And so this little light came from a hill and rushed down through a valley where there are some wells and a creek.“T hen I looked at it hard with both eyes and it came zigzagging towards me very fast. It was not more than twenty meters away. It was in front of a very huge tree not far from our house, so I know how far away it was. And it was the size of a soccer ball. It was a sphere that resem bled glass filled with illumination, like lime green light or green glowing smoke. It was very translucent. I watched it and followed it with my eyes. It was really there. I was stunned, amazed. But there was no interaction with me. It just continued its way through the valley very fast and disap­peared.“In 1994, which was my first year in England, we had a nightwatch on Knap Hill at the East Field. And at this time, there was an eye-shaped form ation dubbed the ‘Eye of H orus.’ There were a bunch of people at Knap Hill and some had a very strong, professional searchlight. A round 11:30 PM, we saw inside the formation, probably in the center, a light started blinking, flashing, a white light, very bright, but very small. I would com pare it to the thing Steve Alexander shot on the hill in 1991.1831999 Crop formation Surveys"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"And it was blinking a tow times.'T h en immediately, people with the searchlight switched it on and this beam of light went over the field very fast from the searchlight. And w e looked without binoculars, and in that second when the beam of light shone on the whole area, this blinking light starts moving fast over the w hole field in a very high speed. Then it stopped at the edge o f the crop and it was blinking three or four times again and then goes off.\"W hat we did then was scan the field with the light and binoculars and there was nobody in the field, nobody in the form ation. After about five minutes or so. we switched off the light. T hen, an o th er light, or the same one. started again blinking three or four times, b ut on the opposite side of the field. .After the three or four times blinking, it went off and we never saw it again.“The only sense I have at this time is that there is a real phenom e­non out there which is really beyond hoaxes and beyond little green men. .And it’s im portant to stay open because if you have a conclusion or some theory, then people create their own walls. Sometimes form ations won’t fit into a particular interpretation and people then say those formations are hoaxed. T h at’s what researchers should never com e to because that puts your id e a/th eo ry on top of the p h enom enon itself. You en d up judg­ing the phenom enon by your personal view.“Nature is creating similar patterns in snowflakes o r in honeycomb hexagons, and there are so many geom etric wonders you can find in nature. But that doesn’t m ean the crop circles are a natural phenom e­non. I think each of us comes to the same question: W hat is behind nature? And then if you come to this point, you realize there is something b ehind nature also which seems to be intelligent.“And what I basically feel myself about the crop circles, I d o n ’t know how they do it, b u t those shapes touch your soul an d they change peo­p le ’s lives. We have people coming each year and they change their busi­ness. Before they were very in business for the money. A nd now they change it to what they want to do. It doesn’t have to be anything with the crop circles. But ju st the way they want to have their life.“I have seen over two h u n d red form ations in the last two years.

For example, the Beltaine W heel [ancient Celtic May Day celebration] which arrived May 4, 1998, at the West K ennett Long Barrow in fragile oilseed rape.

Ezekiel was a priest who lived with Jewish exiles in Babylon, which is m o d ern day Iraq. Ezekiel wrote about his conversations with God who told him to face northw ard toward the land of Magog in what scholars think is central Asia and: “Tell the Gog King that the Lord God says, ‘I am against you, Gog.’” Biblical scholars say Gog represents the aggregate m ilitary o f heathen nations to be led by Satan in a war against God in a m ighty battle at the end times.W here is Gog, besides the Gog Magog Hills in England? I explored several world atlases and found a Magog an d Lake Magog east of M ontreal, Canada. But no Gog.I also searched the Encyclopedia Britannica for the w ord Gog and found the rem arkable inform ation that Gog and M agog were the sur­vivors o f a race of giants.Giants are also m entioned in the Bible as offspring o f sexual inter­course between hum an women and the gods, o r angels, o f Eden.

Today, Arm enia is eastern Turkey and Iran.

London attorney, John Hunt, had walked around the field, camped at its edge Saturday night and told me no pat­tern was there before dark. He was awakened by rain and wind that per­sisted through the night.Yet, at sunrise a few hours later the farmer found all those circles, ranging from the large 72-foot-diameter central circle down to the small­est 40-inch-diameter circles that dotted along six, curving arms. Given the immense size of the circular geometry, I asked New Jersey land surveyor, Vincent Creevy, to study photographs of the pattern and estimate how long it would take his survey team to mark out the formation.Vince told me, “To stake something like this out in the field from a surveying perspective, it’s probably going to take nearly two days work because you’ve got 409 points. You would have to lay out the radius point of every circle in that formation to get it perfectly symmetrical. Further, the office calculations you would need for something like that would probably also take the better part of a day with a computer. This would be laid out with an electronic distance meter and a data collector that would already have stored all the point coordinates.31SBefore September11, 2001"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"It certainly would be a difficult task to lay this thing out.

And without an aerial picture, you simply would not know what, the pattern is.“I measured each diam eter of each circle of one of the six arms, even of the small circles on the side. And took some control measurements in other arms. So, this gives you quite a workable basis for doing the survey work. The biggest circle was in fact the central circle with 22 meters in diam eter (72 feet). And the smaller circles that were the caterpillar like arms on the sides of the six arms were 1 meter, or about 40 inches.“The night of August 11 had heavy rain. The next m orning, people who were first in the formation said the lay was nice and clean and with no footprints on it.

And this was very difficult for me to understand because those irregularities in the ground did not cause any distortion or irregularity in the form ation. Accommodating irregular surfaces is a basic problem for architecture.“For example, to make the foundation for a house, builders have to create a flat and right angle platform upon which they can build. O r they have to do a very detailed topographical survey o f the whole ground to make a structure fit the topography. A rchitecture makes the same as crop circles do — they bring geom etry on the ground.

Further, the center of the Chilbolton Code’s bottom symbol is divided into four “dots” exactly as the fifth raised planet in the line above is depicted as four dots. I asked a Cornell University astronomer if there was any prece­dent in earth astronomy for depicting a planet as divided into four parts. He said, “No. It might represent four moons or four rings, but I’ve never seen a planet symbolized by four dots like that before.”One can also wonder why the intelligence behind the wheat code put the odd “transmitter” pattern next to the Chilbolton Observatory in August 2000, a full year before the Code’s emergence on August 20,2001.Wheat Code Comparison to 1974 Arecibo TransmissionThe August 20, 2001 Code in the wheat field next to the Chilbolton Observatory is arranged in the same Arecibo information sequence, but336Mysterious Lights ant) Crop Circles"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"with other changes moving upward above the* transmitter section.

Photo © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen.On August 25, 2001, Paul Vigay drove half a day from his Southsea, Hampshire home to Chilbolton to see the Code formation for himself. He wanted to measure details in the PONCH element sequence and spent a long time on his hands and knees with a ruler in the waning after­noon light. After he returned home, Paul called me for a radio broadcast.“On the ground — which you can’t see unless you analyze it in detail which I did confirm today — there are actually six columns in the binary element sequence, compared to five columns in the 1974 Arecibo trans­mission. So, whoever did this code formation inserted an extra element.“Now they have inserted it between the oxygen and the phospho­rous, so instead of going 1, 6, 7, 8, 15, they’ve actually coded it as 0111, which is 14. So, it then goes 1, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15 in the code.“Then, if you look up the atomic number for 14, you get silicon.337Before September n, 2001"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"I hat is very interesting because lots o f peo p le have speculated that if there are alien life forms, which are n o t carbon-based life forms as every­thing is on earth, then about the only o th e r elem en t in the entire peri­odic table that could possibly su pp o rt life is silicon-based life forms.

C. Levengood from M ichigan analyzed soils and plants from the Milk Hill and Chilbolton form ations. As he has found in so many form ations described earlier in this book, growth nodes were lengthened and had expulsion cavities, those small holes blown out of the stem nodes. They were very small com pared to expulsion cavities previ­ously seen in other form ations where holes in the growth nodes have been a quarter-inch wide. (See Chapters 2 and 8.)As Levengood hypothesizes, cell water is heated by microwave energy in a “spinning plasma vortex” of unknown origin that interacts with crops to produce some, but not all, crop formations. The heated water reaches steam temperatures and bursts out, leaving the expulsion cavities behind.Tiny expulsion cavities in crop formation nodes collected from August 12, 2001, 409-circle formation at Milk Hill, Wiltshire, England.

But when the Milk Hill seeds were germinated under controlled laboratory conditions, the plants had a 111% increase in the mean growth rate compared to the cor trols. Photographs on the next page show that accelerated growth com- pared to the much shorter germination of normal control plants col- lected at a distance from the Milk Hill formation.Levengood wrote in his report, “These pronounced growth differ ences are never observed under normal conditions. What we are observ- ing here is that seeds from the formation samples that show reduced seed weight are germinating and growing at faster rates than seeds from the sample sets taken outside the formation. ...The enigma of lower seed weights and higher seedling vigor is due to the fact that when the for­mation occurred, the seeds stopped development in the presence of microwave energies. But the normal plant controls continued to fill out the endosperms during the following two week period before sampling.”Levengood has frequently found increased growth rate from for­mation seeds. He has demonstrated in his lab that controlled, short bursts of ions on cereal crops can produce accelerated growth.339Before September ii; 2001"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Wheat seeds from inside the August 12, 2001, Milk Hill formation had 111% increase in their mean growth rate compared to the control plant seeds above.
