He kept it fairly regularly from 1912 to 1920, and also wrote a few entries in 1909, 1911 and 1927. At different times he gave this diary different names. “Record of Yoga” was the most typical and the editors have used it as the general title of the work. During the years he kept the diary, Sri Aurobindo also wrote other materials relating to his practice of yoga. These include de- scriptions of the seven “chatusthayas” (groups of four elements), which are the basis of the yoga of the Record . These materials are published in the Introduction, in Parts Four and Five, and in the Appendix. Sri Aurobindo wrote the diary and related materials by hand in various notebooks and on loose sheets of paper. He used a special terminology which included words from Sanskrit and other languages, as well as abbreviations, symbols and markings, some of which are difficult to represent in a printed book. The special terminology is explained in a separate glossary. The editors have tried to reproduce the details of the manuscripts as exactly as pos- sible. Editorial problems arising from damage to the manuscripts, illegibility, etc. are indicated by means of the system explained in the Guide to Editorial Notation on the next page.

Samata The basis of internal peace is samata, the capacity of receiving with a calm and equal mind all the attacks and appearances of outward things, whether pleasant or unpleasant, ill-fortune and good-fortune, pleasure and pain, honour and ill-repute, praise and blame, friendship and enmity, sinner and saint, or, physically, heat and cold etc. There are two forms of samata, passive and active, samata in reception of the things of the outward world and samata in reaction to them. (1) Passive Passive samata consists of three things EtEt\bodAsFntA nEtErEt smtA\u0007 titiksha, udasinata, natih iti samata Titiksha Titiksha is the bearing firmly of all contacts pleasant or un- pleasant, not being overpowered by that which is painful, not being carried away by that which is pleasant. Calmly and firmly to receive both and hold and bear them as one who is stronger, greater, vaster than any attack of the world, is the attitude of titiksha. Udasinata Udasinata is indifference to the dwandwas or dualities; it means literally being seated above, superior to all physical and mental touches. The udasina, free from desire, either does not feel the touch of joy & grief, pleasure and pain, liking and disliking, or he feels them as touching his mind and body, but not himself, he"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 Record of Yoga being different from mind and body and seated above them. Nati Nati is the submission of the soul to the will of God; its ac- ceptance of all touches as His touches, of all experience as His play with the soul of man. Nati may be with titiksha, feeling the sorrow but accepting it as Gods will, or with udasinat ́ a, rising superior to it and regarding joy and sorrow equally as Gods working in these lower instruments, or with ananda, receiving everything as the play of Krishna and therefore in itself delightful. The last is the state of the complete Yogin, for by this continual joyous or anandamaya namaskara to God constantly practised we arrive eventually at the entire elimination of grief, pain etc, the entire freedom from the dwandwas, and find the Brahmananda in every smallest, most trivial, most apparently discordant detail of life & experience in this human body. We get rid entirely of fear and suffering; Anan- dam Brahmano vidv ́ an na bibheti kutaschana. We may have to begin with titiksha and udasinata but it is in this ananda that we must consummate the siddhi of samata. The Yogin receives victory and defeat, success and ill-success, pleasure and pain, honour and disgrace with an equal, a sama ananda, first by buddhi-yoga, sep- arating himself from his habitual mental & nervous reactions & insisting by vichara on the true nature of the experience itself and of his own soul which is secretly anandamaya, full of the sama ananda in all things. He comes to change all the ordinary values of experience; amangala reveals itself to him as mangala, defeat & ill-success as the fulfilment of Gods immediate purpose and a step towards ultimate victory, grief and pain as concealed and perverse forms of pleasure. A stage arrives even, when physical pain itself, the hardest thing for material man to bear, changes its nature in experience and becomes physical ananda; but this is only at the end when this human being, imprisoned in matter, subjected to mind, emerges from his subjection, conquers his mind and delivers himself utterly in his body, realising his true anandamaya self in every part of the adh ́ ara."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Sapta Chatusthaya 5 (2) Active It is this universal or sama ananda in all experiences which constitutes active samata, and it has three parts or stages, rs\u0002 \tFEtrAn\u0001d iEt svA n\u0001d\u0002 Rasah, pritir anandah [iti sarvanandah] Rasa is the appreciative perception of that guna, that ́ aswada, taste and quality which the Ishwara of the lila perceives in each different object of experience (vishaya) and for the enjoyment of which He creates it in the lila. Pritih is the pleasure of the mind in all rasa, pleasant or unpleasant, sweet or bitter. Ananda is the divine bhoga superior to all mental pleasure with which God en- joys the rasa; in ananda the opposition of the dualities entirely ceases. Shanti Only when samata is accomplished, can shanti be perfect in the system. If there is the least disturbance or trouble in the mentality, we may be perfectly sure that there is a disturbance or defect in the samata. For the mind of man is complex and even when in the buddhi we have fixed ourselves entirely in udasinata or nati, there may be revolts, uneasinesses, repinings in other parts. The buddhi, the manas, the heart, the nerves (prana), the very bodily case must be subjected to the law of samata. Shanti may be either a vast passive calm based on ud ́ asinata or a vast joyous calm based on nati. The former is apt to associate itself with a tendency to inaction and it is therefore in the latter that our Yoga must culminate. Sukha Sukham is the complete relief & release from duhkha, from vishada, which comes by the fulfilment of samata and shanti. The perfected Yogin has never in himself any touch of sorrow, any tendency of depression, cloud or internal repining and weariness, but is always full of a sattwic light and ease.

To put it from a higher standpoint, it is the siddhi of the divine Shakti working in these three principles. vFy\u000b fE\f\r\u000eXFBAv\u0002 \u000f\u0010\u0011Et fE\fct \u0003 \u0006y\u0004\u0007 Virya, shakti, chandibhavah, sraddha, iti shaktichatusthayam. Virya The Chaturvarnya By Virya is meant the fundamental swabhavashakti or the ener- gy of the divine temperament expressing itself in the fourfold type of the ch ́ aturvarnya, in Brahmanyam, brahmashakti, brahmatejas, in kshatram, kshatrashakti, kshatratejas, in Vaishyaswabhava, shakti and tejas, in Shudraswabhava, shakti and tejas. We must realise that the ancient Aryan Rishis meant by the ch ́ aturvarnya not a mere social division, but a recognition of God manifesting Himself in fundamental swabhava, which our bodily distinctions, our social orders are merely an attempt to organise in the symbols of human life, often a confused attempt, often a mere parody and distortion of the divine thing they try to express. Every man has in himself all the four dharmas, but one predominates, in one he is born and that strikes the note of his character and determines the type and cast of all his actions; the rest is subordinated to the dominant type and helps to give it its complement. No Brahmana is a complete Brahmana, unless he has the Kshatratejas in him, the Vaishyashakti and the Shudrashakti, but all these have to serve in him the fullness of his Brahmanyam. God manifests Himself as the four Prajapatis or Manus, the chatwaro manavah of the Gita, & each man is born in the ansha of one of the four; the first characterised by wisdom and largeness, the second by heroism and force, the third by dexterity and enjoyment, the fourth by work and service. The perfected man develops in himself all four capacities and contains at once the god of wisdom & largeness, the god of heroism and force, the god of skill and enjoyment, the god of work & service. Only, one stands dominant and leads and uses the others."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 Record of Yoga Brahmatejas \u0012AnEl\u0013sA \u0012An\tkAfo b \u0014\u0015vc \u0005y\u0004 \u0005T\u0016yEmEt b\u0014\u0015t\u0011j\u0002\u0007 Jnanalipsa jnanaprakasho brahmavarchasyam sthairyam iti brah- matejah. Lipsa I give only the dominant qualities of the type in these defi- nitions. The purna Yogin does not reduce his nature to inaction but perfects it and uplifts in order to place it at the service of the Ishwara in His lila. He accepts the jnanalipsa and purifying it of desire turns it into a divine reaching out towards prakasha of knowledge; this divine desireless reaching out of Brahman in personality to Brahman in the vishaya or object, is the new sense which lipsa acquires in the language of the siddha. Jnanaprakasha Jnana includes both the Para and the Apara Vidya, the knowl- edge of Brahman in Himself and the knowledge of the world; but the Yogin, reversing the order of the worldly mind, seeks to know Brahman first and through Brahman the world. Scientific knowl- edge, worldly information & instruction are to him secondary objects, not as it is with the ordinary scholar & scientist, his primary aim. Nevertheless these too we must take into our scope and give room to Gods full joy in the world. The methods of the Yogin are also different for he tends more and more to the use of direct vision and the faculties of the vijnana and less and less to intellectual means. The ordinary man studies the object from outside and infers its inner nature from the results of his external study. The Yogin seeks to get inside his object, know it from within & use external study only as a means of confirming his view of the outward action resulting from an already known inner nature. Brahmavarchasya Brahmavarchasya is the force of jnana working from within a man which tends to manifest the divine light, the divine power, the divine qualities in the human being."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Sapta Chatusthaya 9 Sthairya Sthairyam is the capacity of fixity in jnana; the man who is sthira is able to hold the light and power that enters into him without stumbling or being dazzled and blinded by the shock and to receive & express the divine gunas in himself without being carried away by them & subjected to the blind, rushing stream of Prakriti.

Abhaya & Sahasa Abhayam is the passive freedom from fear which with a bold calmness meets and receives every menace of danger and shock of misfortune. Sahasam is the active courage and daring which shrinks from no enterprise however difficult or perilous and cannot be dismayed or depressed either by the strength or the success of the opposing forces. Yashas By yashas is meant victory, success and power. Although the Kshatriya must be ready to face and accept defeat, disaster and suffering, yet his objective, the thing towards which he moves, is yashas. He enters the field to conquer, not to suffer. Suffering is only a means towards victory. Here again the reaching out, the lipsa must come to be free from desire & consist in the divine reaching out of God within to His self-fulfilment as the Kshatriya. Therefore the Kshatriya must manifest in himself the nature of the Brahmin, jnana & sthairyam, since without knowledge in some form desire cannot perish out of the system. Atmaslagha Atmasl ́ agh ́ a in the unpurified Kshatriya is pride, self-confi- dence & the knowledge of his own might.

Kaushalam is the dexterity & skill which is able so to arrange the means, the equipment, the action as to produce the greatest results possible & the best arranged results.

Bhoga is his object; possession & enjoyment, not merely of physical things, but all enjoyment, enjoyment of knowledge, of power, of self-giving, of service, comes within its scope. The Vaishya, purified and liberated, becomes the supreme giver and lover & enjoyer, Vishnus ansha preserving & making the most of the world.

From this standpoint he is the greatest of the four shaktis, because his nature goes direct towards complete atmasamarpana; but the Shudra bound has cut himself off from knowledge, power and skill & lost himself in the tamoguna.

The principle of prema must find itself and fulfil itself in dasyalipsa and atmasamarpana, in the surrender of himself to God and to God in man and the selfless service of God and of God in man.

If the body is unfit, the system is unable to hold these things perfectly. In extreme cases the physical brain is so disturbed by the shock from above as to lead to madness, but this is only in entirely unfit & impure adharas or when Kali descends angrily & violently avenging the attempt of the Asura to seize on her and force her to serve his foul & impure desires. Ordinarily, the incapacity of the body, the nervous system and the physical brain shows itself in slowness of progress, in slight derangements and ailments, in unsteady hold of the siddhi which comes & slips away, works & is spilled out.

The two first chatusthayas of the adhara have reference mainly to the central principle of mans existence, the antahkarana; but there is one superior faculty and one inferior instrument which have each its peculiar siddhi, the vijnana or supraintellectual faculty and the body. The siddhi of the vijnana and the siddhi of the body belong both of them to that range of experience and of divine fulfilment which are abnormal to the present state of humanity. These are called specially siddhis, because of their abnormal nature[,] rarity and difficulty; they are denied by the sceptic and discouraged by the saint. The sceptic disbelieves in them and holds them to be impos- tures, fables or hallucinations, as a clever animal might disbelieve in the reasoning powers of man. The saint discourages them because they seem to him to lead away from God; he shuns them just as he shuns the riches, power & attainments of this world, and for the same reason. We need not shun them and cannot shun them, because God is sought by us in His world-fulfilment as well as apart from the world and in the world these are the riches of His power and knowledge which we cannot avoid, once we dwell in Him perceiving and sharing His nature. Indeed, there is a stage reached by the Yogin, when, unless he avoids all action in the world, he can no more avoid the use of the siddhis of power and knowledge than an ordinary man can avoid eating and breathing unless he wishes to leave his body; for these things are the natural action of the vijnana, the plane of ideal consciousness, to which he is rising, just as mental activity and physical motion are the natural action of mans ordinary life. All the ancient Rishis used these powers, all great Avatars and Yogins and vibhutis from Christ to Ramakrishna have used them; nor is there any great man with the divine power at all manifest in him who does not use them continually in an imperfect form without knowing clearly what are these supreme faculties that he is employing.

At the same time there is a justification for the denial of the sceptic and the renunciation by the saint, & of this justification we must take note. The saint renounces because when these siddhis show themselves fragmentarily in a weak adhara dominated by egoism, the egoism becomes enormously enhanced, the ignorant sadhaka thinking that he is the possessor & creator of these abnormal powers and a very great man indeed, (just as we find an abnormal egoism very frequent in the small poet and the half artist, for those who have a really great power, know well enough that the power is not theirs but a gift from God & feel that the power of God is using them & not they the power); so the sadhaka, misled by ahank ́ ara goes running after these powers for their own sake and leaves following after God. The denial of the sceptic is justified by the credulity of ordinary men who regard these things as miracles & invent them where they do not exist, and by the weakness & egoism of the sadhakas themselves and of many who are not sadhakas; for if they catch even a glimpse of these things in themselves or others, they exaggerate, puff, distort & build around some petty & imperfect experiences all sorts of jargon, mysticism, charlatanism & bujruki of all kinds which are an offence & a stumbling block to the world. We must therefore keep in view very strictly certain fixed principles; 1. That these powers are not miraculous, but powers of Na- ture, which manifest of themselves as soon as the vijnanapadma in us begins to open, & are no more a cause for bragging & vanity than the power of eating & breathing or anything else that is Natures. 2. That they can manifest fully only when we leave ego and offer up our petty separate being in the vastness of Gods being. 3 That when they manifest in the unpurified state, they are a dangerous ordeal to which God subjects us and we can only pass through it safely by keeping our minds clear of vanity, pride,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 Record of Yoga selfishness and by remembering continually that they are His gifts and not our acquirements. 4. That these powers are not to be pursued for their own sake, but developed or allowed to develop as part of the flower of divine perfection which is by Gods grace blossoming out in us. Subject to these cautions, we have not to reject these powers when they come but accept them, to be used in us by God for His own purposes and not by us for ours, to be poured out by vyapti on humanity and not kept for our own use & pride.

Drishti Drishti is the faculty by which the ancient Rishis saw the truth of Veda, the direct vision of the truth without the need of obser- vation of the object, reasoning, evidence, imagination, memory or any other of the faculties of the intellect. It is as when a man sees an object and knows what it is, even if, sometimes, he cannot put a name on it; it is pratyakshadarsana of the satyam. Sruti Sruti is the faculty by which we perceive as in a flash the truth hidden in a form of thought or in an object presented to our knowledge or in the word by which the thing is revealed. It is that faculty by which the meaning of the mantra dawns on the mind or on the being of the sadhaka, although when he first heard it, he did not know its meaning nor was it explained to him. It is as when a man hears the name of a thing and by the name itself, without seeing the thing, comes to know its nature. A special power of sruti is the revelation of truth through the right & perfect vak in the thought. Smriti Smriti is the faculty by which true knowledge hidden in the mind reveals itself to the judgment and is recognised at once as the truth. It is as when a man has forgotten something he knew to be the fact, but remembers it the moment it is mentioned to him. Intuition & viveka Intuition is the power which distinguishes the truth and sug- gests at once the right reasons for its being the truth; viveka the power which makes at once the necessary limitations and distinc- tions & prevents intellectual error from creeping in or an imperfect truth from being taken for the whole satyam.

Directly we get an intuition or revelation, the intellect, memory, imagination, logical faculty seize hold of it & begin to disguise it in a garb of mingled truth & error, bringing down truth to the level of the nature, sanskaras and preferences of a man instead of purifying & elevating his nature & judgments to the level of the truth. Without viveka, these powers are as dangerous to man as they are helpful. The light they give is brighter than the light of the intellect, but the shadow which the intellect creates around them is often murkier than the mist of ignorance which surrounds ordinary intellectual knowledge. Thus men who use these powers ignorantly, often stumble much more than those who walk by the clear though limited light of the intellect. When these powers begin to work in us, we must be dhira and sthira and not be led away by our enthusiasm; we must give time for the viveka to seize on our thoughts & intuitions, arrange them, separate their intellectual from their vijnanamaya elements, correct their false extensions, false limitations, misapplications & assign them their right appli- cation, right extension, right limitation, make, in the image of the Upanishads, the vy ́ uha or just marshalling of the rays of the sun of knowledge, suryasya rashmayah. Knowledge is not for the hasty mind but only for the dhira, who can sit long accumulating & arranging his store and does not rush away with fragments like a crow darting off with the first morsel of food on which it can seize. Realisation Realisation or jnana of experience is the perception of things through bhava, bhava of being or Sat, realising the truths of being, bhava of Chit or knowledge, realising the truths of thought, bhava of tapas or force, realising the truths of force & action, bhava of love or ananda realising the truths of emotion & sensation and bliss.

It deals with particular fact, just as jnana deals with general truth. Trikaldrishti works in several ways; 1. Directly, without a means or excuse, by drishti, sruti & smriti. 2. By dwelling in concentration on the object, that process which Patanjali calls sanyama on the object, until the mind in observer & observed becoming one, we know what the object contains, whether past, present or future, just as we can know the contents of our own being. 3. By using as a means some external sign or some indicative science, such as samudrik, astrology, augury etc. These sciences are worth little, if not used by the higher vijnanamaya faculties; for the signs they use, are mostly indications of tendencies and to distin- guish perfectly tendencies of possibility from actual eventualities cannot be done by following written shastra or by rule of thumb. 4.

Prakamya By prakamya is meant the full prakasha of the senses and the manas, by which they surpass the ordinary limits of the body and become aware by sight[,] hearing, touch or, more usually and more easily, by mental sensation and awareness"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"20 Record of Yoga 1. Of objects, scenes & events at a distance or hidden from the normal operation of the mind & senses. 2. Of objects, scenes & events belonging to other planes of existence. 3 Of objects, etc belonging to the past or future the images of which are contained in the object of our study. 4. Of the present states of mind, feeling, sensation etc of others or of their particular thoughts, feelings & sensations; or of such states or particular thoughts etc which they have had in the past & of which the impression remains in the chitta record or which they will have in the future & of which the image is already prepared in the prescient parts of the chitta. Vyapti To each form of prakamya there is a corresponding form of vyapti, ie reception or communication. By prakamya, for instance, we can have the perception of anothers feelings; by vyapti these feelings are felt striking on our own consciousness or ours are thrown into another. Prakamya is the sight of one looking from a distance & seeing an object; vyapti is the sensation of that object coming towards us or into contact with us. It is possible by vyapti to communicate anything we have in our systems, thought, feeling, power, etc, to another and if he is able to seize and hold it, he can make it his own & use it. This can be done either by a sort of physical throwing of the thing in us into the other or by a will upon the Swabhava compelling it to effect the transfer. The teacher & the guru habitually use this power of vyapti which is far more effective than speech or writing but all men use or suf- fer it unconsciously. For every thought, feeling, sensation or other movement of consciousness in us creates a wave or current which carries it out into the world-consciousness around and there it enters into any adhara which is able and allowed to receive it. Half at least of our habitual thoughts and feelings are such unconscious borrowings. Aishwarya Aishwarya is effectiveness of the Will acting on object or event without the aid of physical means. It may work"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Sapta Chatusthaya 21 1, by pressure or tapas of the chaitanya straight on the object that has to be affected 2, by pressure or tapas of chaitanya on the Prakriti (either the general world-Prakriti or Prakriti in the object itself) to bring about directly the result intended 3, by pressure on the Prakriti to bring about circumstances which will compel indirectly the result intended. 4, without pressure by mere thought that is will, the ajna or ajnanam of the Ishwara which Prakriti automatically obeys. The last is the highest power of Aishwarya and its supreme siddhi; for here Chit & Tapas become one as in the Will of God Himself. Ishita Ishita is the same effectiveness of the will acting not as a command or through the thought, by ajnanam, but through the heart or temperament (chitta) in a perception of need or pure lipsa. Whatever the lipsa reaches out towards or even needs without conscious knowledge of the need, comes of itself to the man who possesses Ishita. Ishita also expresses itself either by pressure on the object or Prakriti or by simple perception automatically effective of its aim. The last is again the highest power of Ishita and its supreme siddhi. Vashita Vashita is the control of the object in its nature so that it is submissive to the spoken word, receptive of the thought conveyed or sensitive & effective of the action suggested. Vashita acts auto- matically through established control of one nature by another, or by the pouring of natural force into the word, thought or suggestion of action so as to produce an effect on the nature of others. The latter is the lower & ordinary siddhi, the former the supreme or entirely divine siddhi. Vyapti is one of the chief agents of Vashita. The Conditions of Power It should be noted that none of the siddhis of power can act perfectly or freely so long as there is impurity of the chitta, egoism in the thought and temperament or domination of desire in the use"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22 Record of Yoga of the siddhi. Under such circumstances there may be occasional use & irregular effectivity of the power, a thing not worth hav- ing in itself, but useful only in training the mind to give up its own sanskaras & habitual processes & accept the activity of the vijnanamayi shakti; or there may be a regular & effective use of limited powers by fixed Tantric processes (kriyas). The latter should be shunned by the sadhakas of the purna Yoga. The Conditions of Jnana It should also be noted that perfect jnana and trikaldrishti are only possible by complete shuddhi of the antahkarana, especially the exclusion of desire and vishuddhi of the buddhi, absolute pas- sivity of the manas and, finally, perfected action of the powers of the vijnana. An imperfect & irregular action of these higher powers is always possible & is possessed obscurely by many who are not Yogins or sadhakas. Physical Siddhis The physical powers, Mahima[,] Laghima, Anima, need not be considered at present, as, although belonging to the dharma of the vijnana, they act in the body and are strictly part of the physical siddhi. Samadhi Samadhi is the power by dwelling fixedly of the chaitanya on its object to extend the range of knowledge & consciousness through all the three states of waking, sleep & dream, to the realisation of those tattwas of the Brahman to which the ordinary waking consciousness is blind and to the experience, either in reflected images or in the things themselves, of other worlds and planes of consciousness than the material earth or this waking physical con- sciousness.

It does not crave for or demand the pleasure. It does not reject the pain. Even when pleasure or pain are excessive, it wills that the mind and body should not shrink from or repel them, but bear firmly.

Tamasic indifference is associated with vairagya, dis- gust, disappointment, weariness of effort, unwillingness to make an effort. It is not really true udasinata, for it tries to avoid all as equally a cause of suffering, directly or indirectly; it is a generalisation of jugupsa and does not come from titiksha, but from its opposite. It is sometimes called rajasic, because although its nature is tamasic, its cause is rajasic, the disappointment of desire. Tamasic udasinata is useful to the Vairagi who wishes to get rid of the world by any means, but to the striver after perfection it is a stumbling-block. Its only use is to discourage the persistent rajoguna, and when it comes, it has to be admitted for that purpose. But it does almost as much harm as good, & so long as we cannot do without it, our progress is likely to be slow, a series of oscillations between rajasic eagerness and tamasic weariness born of disappointment, with tamasic udasinata as an occasional release from the wear & tear of these opposites. To rest finally in tamasic udasinata is fatal to perfection. Rajasic udasinata is indifference enforced by effort, sustained by resolution, habitualised by long self-discipline. It is the indif- ference of the moral hero, of the stoic. This is more helpful than the tamasic, but if persisted in, has a hardening and narrowing effect on the soul which diminishes in flexibility & in capacity for delight. Rajasic udasinata if used, must always be surmounted. It is an instrument which may easily become an obstacle. Sattwic udasinata is indifference born of knowledge. It comes with the perception of the world either as an illusion or a play and of all things as being equal in the Brahman. It is calm, luminous, free from effort, tolerant of all things, smilingly indifferent to all happenings, careful to reject rajasic & tamasic reactions. Sattwic indifference is a great help and a stage which is almost unavoidable. But it has its limitations. It stands apart from the world and is a preparation for moksha, for the withdrawal from the Lila. It is unsuitable as a final resting plac e for the sadhak of perfection. Trigunatita udasinata is that which takes all things alike, mak- ing no difference between sattwic, rajasic & tamasic reactions, but"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Incomplete Notes on the First Chatusthaya 27 holding in soul aloof from all these movements & all the dwandwas, observing them first with an absolute impartiality & by constant refusal to participate in them getting rid of them out of the mind & the prana. It neither rejoices nor grieves at their coming & going, na sochati, na nandate. It regards all these things as the workings of Prakriti & their causes as the will of the Ishwara. This udasinata is the preparation for the third element of [samata], 2 nati. Nati . Nati is an equal submission to the will of the Ishwara. It re- gards all things as that will expressing itself and refuses to grieve or revolt inwardly at anything because it is hurt in its egoistic desires, opinions, preferences etc. Its whole attitude is based on the perception of God in all things & happenings. It accepts pleasure & pain, health & disease, bad fortune & good fortune, honour & disgrace, praise & blame, action & inaction, failure & victory; but attaches itself to none of them. Nati is not a tamasic acquiescence in inaction, a subjection to failure, an indifference to life. That is tamasic udasinata. Nati is active; it accepts life & effort as part of Gods will & His being, but it is prepared equally for all results. It has no longing for fruits, but works for the results pointed out to it as kartavya karma without rajasic straining or tamasic indifference. Shanti Shanti The fullness of negative samata is measured by the firm fixity of Shanti in the whole being. If there is an absolute calm or serenity in the heart & prana, no reactions of trouble, disturbance, yearning, grief, depression etc, then we may be sure that negative samata is complete. If there is any such disturbance, then it is a sign that there is some imperfection of titiksha, of udasinata or of nati. This imperfection may not be in the centre of the being, but only in its outer parts. There will then be a fixed calm in the centre, but some disturbance on the surface. These superficial disturbances may even be violent & veil the inner established shanti, but it always reemerges. Afterwards the disturbance becomes more & more thin 2 MS udasinat ́ a"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"28 Record of Yoga in its density & feeble in its force. It ends in an occasional depression of the force & courage & faith & joy in the soul, negative & often without apparent cause, & then disappears entirely. Negative samata & shanti are the necessary preparation of positive samata and ananda. Without this foundation ananda is always liable to be uncertain in its duration & imperfect in its even fullness. Therefore all these things endurance of all contacts, indifference to all dualities, submission to all movements of the divine Will, perfect inner peace and tranquillity are the first step in perfection. Negative samata & shanti are the result of shuddhi & the condition of mukti Positive Samata. On the basis of Nati we proceed to the positive Samata, ie to say, to Sama Ananda. Its foundation is the Atmajnana or Brahma- jnana by which we perceive the whole universe as a perception of one Being that manifests itself in multitudinous forms and activities. This One is therefore the one Self of all beings, my Self as well as the self of all others, friend and enemy, saint and sinner, man, bird and beast, tree & stone, and all things in the manifestation are the forms and activities of my Self. Moreover, this Self is again the Lord of the Cosmos, the Purushottama, the divine Vishnu, Shiva or Krishna, of whom every individual soul is a conscious centre, aware of its unity with Him in being and also of its difference in the universe; and the manifestation is a Lila or play of the Lord who is in His being all delight; the play, too, therefore, is not only a play of Existence and Consciousness, but also a play of delight. It is the dualities born of ego-sense in the heart, mind & body which creates grief and pain. We have to unite ourselves with this Self, Lord & One & with all things in Him, viewing them as our self, in order to get rid of pain & enjoy the divine Ananda. But, first, it is necessary that we should accept without revolt the Lila equally in all its details & happenings. This comes by Nati. Titiksha is the attitude of equal acceptance by the sense-mind & body, udasinata the attitude of equal acceptance by mind & heart, Nati the attitude"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Incomplete Notes on the First Chatusthaya 29 of equal acceptance by the soul. The soul accepts all things as the play of the all-Blissful Lord, the Will of the supreme self and Ishwara. It accepts action also & the results of action, without being attached to them. But, though not attached, it must learn to take delight in all things even as the Lord takes delight in them. The first delight is that of the Sakshi or Witness, who looking upon the whole action of the universe & even his own action like one who is watching a play or a drama, takes the rasa or taste of the whole thing by the intellect, the sense and the aesthetic faculties. All things, all events are the manifestation of certain gunas or qualities in universal Being; God is Ananta guna, Infinite Qualities.

January 13th. 1912 10.15 a.m. The last record covered the period from Dec 12th. 1911 to January 11th 1912. 1 Liberated from anticipation, it was a pure record of fact and experience, but its correctness was sometimes vitiated by a misvaluation of the significance of the fact through over-appreciation or depreciation. It is intended that the present record should be free from this defect. Ananda has very fully established itself in the field of the indriyas. All sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, movements, actions, are now pleasurable or give pleasure; all carry with them the rasagrahana or appreciation of the beauty of the gunas which they are in expression, the joy of the vijnana in them (the basis of chidghana ananda), the joy of the heart in them (the basis of premananda), the joy of the body in them (the basis of the kamananda), the joy of the mind as indriya in them (the basis of the ahaituka ananda). All this joy is of the nature of bhoga from which the ananda is beginning to emerge. Joy of the spirit in the Ekam which expresses itself (the basis of shuddhananda, chidananda & sadananda together making kaivalyananda) is as yet obscure & involved in the lower anandas. Since yesterday, the ahaituka kamananda & today the sahaituka tivrananda are manifesting. Yesterday also the discomfort of heat & cold and pain were again exiled, though not entirely. Experiments made with the body show that below a certain intensity all pain now gives ananda of bhoga at the time of the feeling of pain, & pain beyond that degree brings it after the immediate acuteness has passed. Sometimes sahaituka raudrananda results. As I write 1 The Record entries for this period have not survived. Ed."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"48 Record of Yoga ahaituka tivrananda, raudrananda & vaidyutananda (negative) are recommencing; also vishayananda sahaituka and ahaituka, begun yesterday, are becoming more definite. The bhoga of all these forms is already established. The greatest difficulty is found in the pro- longed contact of intense heat with a sensitive part of the body, eg. the heated stone of the floor under the midday sun. The intensity of the heat to the sensation can be increased, lessened or inhibited by Will; the prolonged contact tends to remove the element of suffer- ing unless the Will is made to increase or maintain it, or unless the stream of Will (chit-shakti) is kept tamasic suffering weakly the con- tact instead of meeting it. This daurbalyam has been created in order to bring about certain forms of intense ananda, chiefly viparita. It is possible, as is now clearly seen, to render it a great element of strong positive (not viparita) ananda, but in that case the daurbalyam must be merely a form of balam, in other words, it must be supported by dhairyam and anandadharanashakti. Ananda is now being extended to events. Even depression and sinking are met and claimed by a stream of ananda, and the place, necessity & delight of amangalam, its true mangalamaya nature is being impressed by the jnanam not only on the buddhi but on the sanskaras of the manas, chitta, prana and material body. Pure varna manifested this morning in a form, (dense crude), so that all the material and possible variation of material for the crude forms is, in a way, ready and regularised; only the perfect crude forms have to be subjected to the same process. Other siddhis are in comparative abeyance awaiting the movement of the ananda. 11.20 a.m. The spiritual communications to the ear, this morning, revealed themselves as the communications of two kinds of spirits, those who are merely of the buddha plane, manasic, and given over to error, and those who stand on the borders of the sukshma and the mahat, receiving knowledge from the vijnanam, expressing it in the sukshma. Some of the latter are farther, some nearer to the borderline, some stand upon it, and according to the proximity is the soundness of the expression of the knowledge to the mind and the fullness and force of its substance. Besides these manasic beings, there are the voices of the Suryaloka and Janaloka who have already"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"13 January–8 February 1912 49 manifested. The mere buddha voices are now very rare and weak. The siddhi has risen to the borders of the mahat and reached over into it, and none have power who are below its line of attainment. The thoughts, perceptions etc may also be classified as on the same levels; there is sometimes even a double movement of knowledge in the mahat echoed in the sukshma. The forward movement of the ananda is now being left to itself and another siddhi taken up, the relations of the Jiva (dasyam) with the Master of the Yoga and those whom he has chosen. All restraint by the mind or any other organ used by the Jiva is to be entirely abandoned. The Vani that announces appears as that of an Angel of God, controlling, but aware of the derivative nature of the control & allowing the vak to flow through her. The derivative control of the world by Angels, Powers, Gods, Mahatmas announced by this Vani preceded by a blowing of trumpets in the Anandaloka. [Written] Next day. 10.20 The afternoon was begun with a suspension of definite progress in the siddhi and, afterwards, an attack on the siddhi of the ananda. The most important siddhi was the perfection of the articulate thought, which resumed rapidly all the character- istics of perfect vijnanamaya thought, prakasha, asu, nischaya, inevitability (adequate, effective and effective illuminative) of the vak, truth of substance, nihshabdata. All these were perfected and delivered from breach or restraint, except the nihshabdata which is still pursued with shabda by the annamaya devatas; but the thought can no longer be strongly impeded or suspended by annamaya in- terference, only hampered in its speed. Fluency has been acquired, rapidity prepared and declared due at 8.2 2 a.m. on the morrow. A severe struggle was necessary with the shabda, the attack of the annam being obstinate and furious and added by the necessity of steering clear of the laya of vak in artha-bodha. Involved shabda in implicit vak, not involved vak in arthabodha is the rule of the expression of thought.

It stands on a different footing from other means of spiritual commu- nication. Now that the period of uninterrupted siddhi has begun, there will be no relaxation of the karma and the siddhi, the karma only waiting for the effectiveness of the power, the siddhi perfecting its force as the tapas increases in the body.

There is no personality manifest behind this script, but this script belongs to the Master of the Yoga and proceeds from him through a passive channel. There is a siege by the annamaya-chitta. It is allowed in order to get rid of it. Meanwhile the siddhis effected stand and those in preparation are being advanced.

There is still imper- fect statement in this script and the imperfection will remain only so long as the trikaldrishti remains imperfect. The whole action of the consciousness on whatever level has to be made vijnanamaya and this is already being done with no farther regard for the hesitations in the chitta. Until the old movements of the annam are entirely cast out, these obstructions will continue; the thought is free, but the thought perception, trikaldrishti and prakamya-vyapti are not free. Still less the lipi & drishti. These have to be liberated, but the full liberation cannot occur today. Only the perfection has been promised, not the freedom from obstruction, although that freedom will be much more rapidly effected than it could have been formerly. Jan 15. Yesterdays promises have had a very meagre fulfilment, for they were made merely to whip into life the dying expectation of progress & finality. There has been only an increased persistence in the few drishtis that present themselves perfectly, the rest being mere blurs & smutches, a revival of consecutive fluency in the lipi, a deepening of the conscious samadhi, an activity of the trikaldrishti which cannot be called perfect or new & is not yet proved in those parts which go beyond previous achievement, some strengthening of the siddhis of power, a constantly active relation with the personal Ishwara, a modification of the Jivas personality and the permanent (not continuous) consciousness of one Personality in all things & beings, a preparation of constant rati of the general ananda some obscure movements of the arogya which seem to be retrograde rather than progressive, an attempt of the elementary utthapana to recover lost ground, and nothing else tangible. Yesterdays was in fact a farther purificatory and preparatory activity. Todays is to be, if prediction can be trusted, an activity like the 13ths. Too much need not be expected, but there will be a constant progress and firm establishment of positive siddhis."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"54 Record of Yoga Lipi 3.

This had already begun, and the lipi is only an explanation. The trikaldrishti is prakamya and intuition of distant movements and is accepted subject to confirmation.

Immediately after the succession of predictive lipis, each of these stages was manifested in type. Lipi. “Stability”, sufficiently clear, “steadiness” dim. That is, the akashalipi is ready for a sufficiently clear stability, persistent in manifestation, not yet for a perfect steadiness in place.

It is legible & in a way clear, but all the letters are not at once clear, nor does the clearness amount to vividness.

There has been a strong revival of tejasic activity in visrishti which seemed likely to become not only momentarily effective to a limited extent, but victorious recovering its old force. In the moment of stress this was twice contradicted by the inspiration which proved to be correct. Prediction has therefore become effective with regard to the bodily movements of the Yoga. The rati in all things (of the prema-ahaituka-chidghana anan- das) is established though occasionally interrupted; the establish- ment of the ratna has now begun. The rati is less forward in events, than in states & vishayas. The corresponding stages of the bhoga have been rapidly passed through without special notice because it is the ananda and not the bhoga that is intended to be the permanent form of the ananda. According to prediction by the Vani there is a simultaneous movement of the jnanam, lipi, trikaldrishti covering the whole range attended by a general manifestation of rupadrishti (akasha & chitra) rough, vague or blurred predicted by the lipis 3, (vague & indistinct), 2 & 1. The movement has begun by the activity of the inspiration and of the viveka rejecting false inspirations. By this means several successive movements of men & animals have been accurately though not completely predicted, a few suggestions of error being rejected in time.

The thought has also taken into itself the history of past ages, but is not yet as perfect in that province as in ordinary thought. The nature of the siddhi, as was recently more than once predicted by the Vani, approximates to the sadhan in the jail and is indeed in its nature the same sadhan, without its intensity, passing into siddhi.

Elementary utthapana was about to fail only once but was soon reinforced; in the other anima fails repeatedly, the last time entirely, but restores itself by a brief rest, the stiffness in the body & pain in the feet disappearing or reaching a minimum manifestation.

The strain on the utthapana- shakti greater than before, but that on the anima slightly more sukshma; the latter is continuous, the former intermittent. Again from 4.15 to 6.15, making 9 hours out of 12. The force of utthapana has increased in the whole system and even at the end of these long trials acknowledges no weariness except in the outer material shell where an inclination to rest shows itself occasionally, but can be removed by a pause, standing, for a minute or a few minutes. The state of the anima varies, the denial sometimes increasing, sometimes diminishing or temporarily decreasing. The power of aisvaryam has greatly increased in the matters of siddhi, producing a much more rapid and spontaneous effect even in things physical than ever formerly. The satyadarshanam with regard to surrounding incidents, suspended for a time, has returned more powerful than when it was suspended but is still hampered by movements of buddha tapas, the one powerful obstacle now to the jnanam, but the power is that of soulless matter, inert and obstruc- tive. A similar suspension of the clear rupadrishti & to some extent of the lipi has been also removed; the prakasha rupas are of great perfection, though not always vivid, and of all kinds and in answer to the aishwaryam is showing colours, red, violet, blue etc. Chhaya- prakasha is also often very perfect.

The progress of the siddhi today was greatly curbed by another attack of the asiddhi, but the asiddhi has no longer much power over the mind and feelings; all it can do is to affect the sraddha, obscure hamper or suspend the siddhis of the third chatusthaya and bring about some reaction in the fourth.

The utthapana does not fail, but is not intense and powerful as before. There is no positive weariness, but in the afternoon there was a general depres- sion of activity. During the exertion pain & stiffness do not show themselves or very slightly, nor even afterwards, only when the exertion has been suspended for some time. Their hold even when manifest is not great. Occasionally they fill the sukshma body & manifest if there is a pause in the activity. Roga was strong today, nevertheless it yields to the aishwaryam without being re- moved entirely. The activity is excess of vayu with a slight element 6 MS the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"60 Record of Yoga of tejasic, jalamaya & parthiva action, but the results are dull and feeble compared with former manifestations. Other rogas can no longer make any impression on the system. Ananda of the nature of rati is becoming stable & permanent even in condition & event, as well as in all vishaya, action, movement etc. The personality is now habitually manifest in all things and persons; but is not always remembered. Trikaldrishti was largely inhibited, but reappeared to- wards the close of the day without recovering complete exactitude except occasionally. Assurance of safety given from outside. The most important development was the confirmation of raudrananda, pain being now invariably attended with pleasure. Formerly only the dull kinds of pain had this attribute, but now it has extended to those which are acute, although the intensity has not yet gone in experience beyond a certain degree. This development has been persistently predicted recently by the ever recurrent rupa of the bee, wasp or hornet. Rupas are now often distinct, stable & perfect on the background as well as in the akasha, but have not advanced otherwise.

The rest of the day has passed in the final purification of the system from all trace of rajas or sensibility of the system to rajasic impressions from outside. The sattwic remnants are also being re- moved, but the process is not yet complete. A relaxation of the elementary utthapana occupied the system. The roga that came, is being slowly eliminated.

The lipi 8 is persistent and points to the early perfection of elementary utthapana by the removal of all nirveda, klanti or necessity of change of occupation for body or mind. The thought, expression & perception, are entirely liberated from in- terference of the mind or from watch by the mind except to a slight extent in the immediate trikaldrishti. Thought, trikaldrishti, vyaptiprakamya; all the elements of jnanam, now act freely & rapidly and with a predominant, though not perfect accuracy. Even the general thought in the minds of others is perceived frequently & has been repeatedly proved. Sraddha in the Yoga is acquiring tejas because now supported by the activity of the jnanam, but in the adesha is not yet existent, though prepared to emerge on the first decisive upalabdhi. Rati in all things except roga is now the rule, & is generally the rati of ananda. A dull nausea has been persistent all the morning, but does not interfere with the appetite or disturb the prana. More has been eaten today than ordinarily & with full rati of food. The lipi & rupas are preparing frequency. Sattwa has finally disappeared and now only touches from time to time as rajas did in its last stage. Tamas has been eliminated, except the asraddha, but still attacks though feebly & with a much diminished heaviness. False vijnanam persists, but is losing its insistence & activity. Tamas, after a strong attack in the evening, was finally ex- pelled, except in the body, and now survives only in ineffective touches; but the uncertainty of asraddha remains, eliminated with regard to the Yoga, occasionally reviving with regard to the rapidity of the siddhi, easily sliding into actual sanshaya with regard to the adesha.

The 21 s . t . has been fixed for the beginning of the perfected siddhis of power, the morning for the beginning of the frequency & stability of the rupa and the lipi. The latter prediction is being fulfilled, but the really vivid & perfect rupas are still prakasha or prakasha-chhaya or occasionally chhaya and there has been some retrogression in the vividness and perfection of lipi & of other rupas, except where the rupas are momentary. The trikaldrishti of the immediate surroundings though of some perfection when left to itself, is still hampered by the activity of foreign suggestions. Exercise of elementary utthapana 7.35 to 10.35 a.m. No weariness but occasional touches of adhogati & stiffness. Relics of watery nausea much water rising into the mouth.

Sleep from 12.30 to 6.30. Jan 22 d .. The morning was occupied by a strong attack of asiddhi in which even the finality of the first chatusthaya was denied. Ad- vantage was taken with regard to an error by which the imperfect harmony of pravritti & prakash tending to an imperfect harmony of pravritti & shama was mistaken for persistence of sattwa, rajas & tamas. This error produced strong asraddha and a return of attack by the triguna. The attack came clearly from outside & did not arise in the adhara but was admitted into it by the consent of the Jiva. The harmonisation of prakash, pravritti & shama is proceeding. Meanwhile the particular siddhis are not definitely active except the physical. There was exercise of elementary utthapana for nearly seven hours from 6.30 to 1.30 with a break of eighteen minutes (12.12 to 12.30) for meals.

Exercise of utthapana 6.55 to 11.40; strong attack of non-anima and tem- porary failure of utthapana. The tendency to ratna in the bhoga continues and there is occasional ratha. The nirananda is mostly in the physical element of the higher anandas where the indriyas are touched. Motions of contact are now commencing in which, starting with the vishaya and the tivra, all the five physical anandas manifest together raudra, vaidyuta and kama following each other or rather developing out of each other. The same ratna of bhoga is being applied to events and happenings and even to the circumstances of roga. Satiety and dharananyunata interfere with the full consummation, but are being subjected to the general law. This movement is connected with a rapid deepening of the dasyam through which the realisation of all motions mental and bodily being inspired, conducted and imposed by Prakriti is being confirmed not only to Chit in buddhi, but also to Chit in sensation, mental nervous and physical. The movements of the body are being liberated from the shadow of emotional or affective intention and choice. Adverse movements are chiefly of the order of roga, a sore throat having taken hold after an interval of several years, and of bodily slackness and failure of utthapana. Jan 25 t . h . &26 t . h .

The dasyam is being rendered firmer and firmer and combined with ananda is perfecting the shama and divesting it of all tamasic elements, per- fecting also the pravritti and divesting it of all rajasic elements. The only tamas left is the physical and the asraddha of the Adesha, the latter the result of insufficient prakasha, the former of the imperfect conquest of the physical being by the vijnanam. The manifestation of the Kalibhava, harmonising the bala, raudra (karali) & shiva Kali, has perfected the second chatusthaya in all but intensity. The remnants of general asraddha in God & swashakti are disappearing and the only province of asraddha is the Adesha and the rapidity of the siddhi. This defect prevents the intensity of kalyanasraddha, and ishwarabhava etc. necessary to the perfection of the second chatusthaya. Jnanaprakasha is now strong and the mithyadharanas (asadgrahas) relating to the Yoga and Lila are disappearing. The Kalibhava and the realisation of self in all and all in the self are growing strong and persistent. The Master of the Yoga is more and more manifest in each detail of experience, but half-veiled by the Prakriti in the surroundings. Sahitya is once more hampered by the refusal of the annam to obey or even contain the vijnanamaya movements of the vak. On the other hand artha becomes more & more full and clear, powerful and luminous. Jnanam & Anandam Brahma are steadily deepening. The chief struggle is over the third & fourth chatusthayas where the annamaya obstruction has concentrated the best of its strength. Ananda has risen from the r ˆ atha of rasagrahana to the ratna of bhoga with a frequent emergence of r ˆ atha, which is espe- cially strong in the sahaituka vishayabhoga & tivra & is spreading to the kama etc. Ananda, even ratha of the kamananda, is begin- ning definitely to emerge. The other bhogas (chidghana, prema, ahaituka, shuddha) are involved in the sharira and emerge out of it. It is here that the contradictions of ananda are occasionally strong. Ratha of the bhoga of events, conditions etc is prevailing. The contradictions are being overborne; pain & discomfort of heat & cold, contact etc are being dominated.

The rogas still capable of touching the surface of the system attack frequently, but cannot hold except for short intervals, com- ing, retiring, succeeding, failing without cause. The disturbances of assimilation are yielding perceptibly to the Arogya; when they come, they cannot hold or make only a brief & seldom violent visit. Three full days of avisrishti were attended with perfect ease and the remaining one and a half with only a vague tendency to distur- bance. Two nominal visrishtis occurred on the fifth & sixth days, but with only parthiva pressure, no tejasic, vayavic or jalamaya. Only at the end of the sixth day (this morning) somewhat acute tejahkshobha produced a copious visrishti of the old type. The system, however, dismissed the kshobha in about fifteen minutes and it went leaving behind no acute results. The central arogya still advances slowly. Sarvasaundaryam is not yet continuously permanent. Jnanam increases in force & exactness. The style of the vak rises to the inspired illuminative and is effective at its lowest level. The thought perception is now almost rid of false vijnanam in its material, but not in the arrangement of its material. Nevertheless accuracy of time is growing, accuracy of place has begun, accuracy of circumstance, chiefly, is defective all this in the trikaldrishti. Prakamya & vyapti are strong and more continuous, less chequered by error. The internal motions of animals & to a less extent of men, the forces working on them, the ananda & tapas from above, even the explicit thoughts are being more and more observed and are usually justified by the attendant or subsequent action. The siddhis of power work well & perfectly, in harmony with the trikaldrishti, not so well when divorced from it. The physical tone of the sys- tem is recovering its elasticity & with it elementary utthapana and bhautasiddhi are reviving. Samadhi improves steadily, but is much hampered by sleep which has revived its force during these last three or four days. Time-prophecy.

There is no definite progress in bhautasiddhi or visvagati though there is some sign of preparation for regularity in the last. The vijnanam is slowly asserting itself in karma. At night according to a previous predic- tion swapna samadhi established its initial perfection in type, the recorded images being of an extraordinary minute perfection in vividness & multitudinous detail & sufficiently though not preem- inently stable, eg a ship of another world.

The sahitya begins to extend itself to all types of prose, with freedom of flow and perfection of type but not yet rapidity of flow or perfection in every detail.

Saundarya bodha has been made finally the natural view of the mind & in- driyas, only faint relics of the asundaram remaining in the physical consciousness. The last relics of asamata are finally disappearing, those of depression giving way to a settled tejas & tapas and the defects of the second chatusthaya are in course of removal. The old prediction about the duta was today fulfilled. Kamananda with the ratha recurs daily, but is not yet frequent or continuous. The lipi is proceeding towards finality, gaining in habit of vividness & maintaining the same relative stability of position; the akashic movement in which it occurs is settling down. The non-physical elements of the third chatusthaya increase slowly. The conquest of the roga in the stomach increases; tejasic excess fails to keep its hold, assimilation has a greater force & when visrishti occurs, it is so little as to be hardly worth reckoning.

After a long progressive advance the lipi has established finally by a sudden manifestation simultaneity, stability, legibility and is only hampered in spontaneous vividness. The unity of the sentence in the lipi is also broken by the superimposition of other sentences. These difficulties were removed in the afternoon and all that is now left is to eliminate the habit of imperfect lipi and strengthen the habit of perfect lipi. The exactitude of trikaldrishti has finally begun, but is strongly combated. Crude rupas are becoming clearer and of all kinds, but tejas, chhaya and prakash predominate. The visrishti broke out on this the seventh day, but tejasic excess only exerted itself, after and not before, for a short time. Subsequently vayavic excess remained for a long time.

The thought is working to establish the inspired instead of the effective as the persistent style of thought expression and to rise from it to absolute inevitability. It does not now sink below the effective. There has been farther trouble about the vani, the anandabuddha being misused; it now tends to be finally replaced by the ananda- mahat. Trikaldrishti is so far advanced that the turns of flight of a butterfly, or a bird can all be predicted during the flight, but there is a difficulty about the prediction of the next movement of an animal in a state of rest. It can be foretold but the action is capricious. Trikaldrishti of things unseen is hampered by diffidence, unless there is a knowledge of the actual occupation in which case the general stages, eg of the progress of cooking, can be told without any material data to go upon, by mere trikaldrishti. There is strong & almost perfect prakamya of inner movements, forces, intentions etc, but not yet of the determining force, movement or action. Vis- vagati revived in force; frequency of sight but not yet the stability. Sukshma smell has revived its activity, but is infrequent.

It has taken so long to complete a long record of wanderings, stumbles, gropings, experiments, for Nature beginning in the dark to grope her way to the light now an assured, but not yet a full lustre, for the Master of the Yoga to quiet the restless individual will and the presumptuous individual intelligence so that the Truth might liberate itself from human possibilities & searchings and the Power emerge out of human weaknesses and limitations. The night of the thirtieth marked by a communication from the sahasradala, of the old type, sruti, but clear of the old confusions which used to rise around the higher Commands. It was clearly the Purushottama speaking and the Shakti receiving the command. Already the lipi had given warning of a new life beginning on the 1 s . t . July, anew life, that is to say, a new type of action, starting with a temporarily complete realisation of novel Personality and the final inevitable seal on the dasyabhava. Not that anything was done abruptly. In this yoga at least nothing has been abrupt except the beginnings, the consummations are always led up to by long preparation & development, continual ebb & flow, ceaseless struggling, falling & rising a progress from imperfection through imperfections to imperfect and insecure perfections & only at last an absolute finality and security. Even now the dasyam though complete in action, is not free of an intellectual questioning. But this last leaven of asraddha, of nastikya-buddhi, is confined to the truth or untruth of the Adesha given in the jail, the apprehension of certain forms of akalyana; it is not capable any longer of positiveness & even at its highest is unable to generalise itself. For the rest the triple dasyam of the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"1–25 July 1912 75 body is active beyond doubt, the last shadowy effigies of the double dasyam is fading away in the mind and feelings there is not the same clearness; for the shadow of the double dasyam still persists by the strength of the asraddha, but the express thought, the vak of the divine communication, the experiences & feelings (all except the depression due to doubt) are ordinarily independent of the anumati . Only the perceptions present still a field to the unhappy indepen- dence of the soul, its triste liberty to doubt & revolt against God, and from this field the others are sometimes temporarily affected. The three forms of dasyam are now distinct and well-marked. The simple dasyam is that obedience to the divine impulsion which is self-chosen & depends on the individuals intelligence of Gods will and his consent, his readiness to obey. The Purusha is still karta & anumanta, a servant of God, not His slave. The great step bridging the transition from the simple to the double dasyam is the renouncement of the kartritwa abhimana, by which we perceive that Prakriti is the only doer of all our actions voluntary or invol- untary from the most deliberately concerted endeavour even to the simplest trifle and, in consciousness, are aware of the impulse of Prakriti in every movement physical or mental. At first the con- sciousness tends to make a false division claiming the movement itself to be our own although the determining impulse is felt as a driving or a pressure proceeding from infinite Nature above or around us. The wearing away of this division marks a farther atten- uation of servanthood and deepening towards the divine servitude. But so long as the anumanta keeps his abhimana and reserves his right of individual lordship ( Ishwara) over Prakriti, we have not passed the stage of simple dasyam. For between the various impulses of Prakriti, we have the sense of choosing, of an active & constant freedom, & although we choose what we understand to be Gods will, it is still our choice that determines the action in the adhara & not His direct and imperative Will. In the double dasyam on the contrary there is no active & constant freedom, but only a general & ultimate freedom which is used little or only exceptionally. We are aware of ourselves as Ishwara & anumanta, the individual ruling & sanctioning authority, but, although we still have the power of refusing our sanction to any particular impulse of"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"76 Record of Yoga Prakriti if we choose, we do not choose; we make no choice, we do not determine what is Gods will and act thereby or order Prakriti to act thereby, but leave everything to God to determine; the whole responsibility is His & a given impulse of Prakriti fulfils itself or not as He chooses without our interference. If the will is used, it is used by Prakriti. We are aware of it as being not our will, but the will in the adhar used by Prakriti. In the triple dasyam, even this potential freedom disappears. Whatever impulse of infinite Nature comes, we could not interfere with it if we wished, any more than the drifting leaf can deny itself to the storm or the engine to the force that works it. We are aware of our body as a whole & in its various parts being moved not by will in the body but by a will or force outside the body; our thoughts, feelings, will-power similarly. Each of these stands perfectly apart from the others & is worked separately by Nature. The will wills & has done; it does not try to determine action but leaves the action to happen or not as Nature pleases; the thought thinks & is done, it does not try to determine either the movement of the will or the movement of the action; the feelings equally live for themselves, atmatripta, not striving to compel action & emotion or thought & feeling to agree. What harmony is necessary is determined by the Para Shakti that drives us, which we feel always as a Force driving us. But this Force is itself only an instrument of a conscious Will driving it, the Will or Anumati of the Purushottama, who is Parameshwara & universal Anumanta. This consummation is also attended by a ripening realisation of the Divine Master. Formerly I realised the Impersonal God, Brahma or Sacchidan[an]dam separately from the Personal, Ishwara or Sac- chidananda. Brahma has been thoroughly realised in its absolute infinity & as the material & informing presence of the world & each thing it contains, yat kincha jagatyam jagat. But the sense of the One has not been applicable utterly & constantly, there have been lacunae in the unitarian consciousness, partly because the Personal- ity has not been realised with equal thoroughness or as one with the Impersonality. Hence while dwelling on the Paratman, the mind, whenever the Jivatman manifested itself in the sarvam Brahma, has been unable to assimilate it to the predominant realisation and an"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"1–25 July 1912 77 element of Dwaitabhava, of Visishtadwaita has entered into its perception. Even when the assimilation is partly effected, the Jiva is felt as an individual & local manifestation of the impersonal Chaitanya and not as the individual manifestation of Chaitanya as universal Personality. On the other hand the universal Sri Krishna or Krishna-Kali in all things animate or inanimate has been realised entirely, but not with sufficient constancy & latterly with little frequency. The remedy is to unify the two realisations & towards this consummation I feel the Shakti to be now moving. The action of this triple dasyam is now characterised by a harmony of shama & tapas. This harmony has been hitherto impos- sible owing to the excess of mental tejas which sought perpetually to energise the action & bring about a more rapid or a more perfect fruit, thus impairing the shama which consists in anarambha, shanti & the perfect realisation by the Jnata-Purusha of his own passivity. The state of action vacillated from tamasic vairagya or udasinata to rajasic heat & fervour of action. All this was an importation from outside, from the annamaya devatas, but a constant importation. With the greater perfection of the dasyam this pendulary vacillation between inertia & disturbance is sinking to rest and the hour of intense (chanda) activity in the Prakriti with perfect anarambha in the Purusha is drawing nearer. The third power of action, Prakasha, which is as a light on the path to the tapas, showing it its own works, is more & more active, but not perfect, although rounding towards perfection. This prakasha has been for the most part vijnanamaya, of the nature of discriminative & selective knowledge, acting directly by discrimination & selection as the first process of thought. For instance, I see a bird flying & I discriminate & select the farther course of its flight by an act of determining illumination I do not see the future flight with the self-vision as I see the present flight with the physical vision & so know about it. I see only the truth (ritam, satyam) about this flight, satyam of it, not sat, its truth of existence, not its existence. But this day I realised more certainly what I had previously perceived by fragmentary experience, that the basis of all knowledge is atmaprakasha of sat; by chit, that is to say, or sat luminous to itself.

The obstacles of vijnana-siddhi and of all subjective siddhi are no longer in myself but in the circumambient annamaya prakriti, not that attached to myself as an atmosphere by my past karma (for that is purified), but the general prakriti. It is from this besieg- ing environment that imperfections expelled from myself reenter temporarily my system or the old regularised sanskaras of Na- ture which we miscall laws stand in the way of progress, eg illness, unease, thirst, limitation of power or knowledge, inactiv- ity of power or knowledge. I feel, for instance, no thirst in the body but a sense of dryness around me & besieging me, but not clinging as it does when in the karmadeha or personal environ- ment; I have sometimes to drink in order to satisfy these devatas. When I feel no bodily chill or discomfort in exposure, sleeping out uncovered in the cold wind at night, yet around me there is an unease & a shrinking which I cannot yet ignore.

It seems that the faculty of rapid interpretation of the rupas, lipis etc is being finally established and there is greater firmness of the trikaldrishti. There is stress in the lipi on the word “prodigy”, which seems to be prophetic in its nature. The symbols of phys- ical ananda have been determined and were repeatedly shown a butterfly for kamananda, (this is of long standing), a wasp for raudrananda, a bee or honeyfly for ti vrananda, the long Indian bee for vishayananda, a moth for vishayananda. 2 Lipi 25 th George first end of existing state of destiny.

Even in those the adhogati works through kala to recreate it. July 3 d . The barrier offered in the annamaya prakriti to all decisive fulfilment of the vijnana-chatusthaya (the siddhis of knowledge & power incidental to the opening of the ideal faculty) [has] 3 at last given way. The power of trikaldrishti in those movements which are nearest to the prakamya and vyapti (perception and reception of the truth about objects by sanyama on the objects or contact in consciousness with them), [has] 4 triumphed over the obstruction. Instead of a difficult choice of the truth, past, present & future, about things & happenings, a choice hampered by a siege of false suggestions from the physical gods in the material environment, the suggestions themselves are coming to be automatically true. The vijnanam which is satyam ritam is conquering the last fields of mentality & imposing its satyadharma or law of self-existent truth which is necessary for perfect vision of things, satyadhar- maya drishtaye. The movement is not yet entirely triumphant, for the enemy returns to the charge and clouds the siddhi with the anritam, but in the siddhi now there is fixity &, though not perfect continuity, yet a prevailing persistence. The enemy cannot prevent the persistence. The condition of success appears to be perfect pas- sivity. If there is any arambha, any setting about to know, mental activity with its tangled web of error starts again; Truth, the satyam, is idea true in itself, self-revealing[,] atmaprakasha, not acquired, not in any way arrived at.

There are four tendencies that prevent its proper action & effectuality; (1) the tendency to miss the object of the prayoga, as when Pallas Athene turns the shafts from the hero of her preference, so that the aishwarya or vashita does not act upon it at all; (2) the tendency because of habit, previous purpose or tendency or mere recalci- trance to a novel suggestion to pay no heed to it, to shake off the shaft of suggestion from the mental body & go on ones way, if one is in motion or remain firm, if static, as if the suggestion had not reached; by the sukshmadrishti or by some involuntary movement the hitting of the mark by the force aimed at it can be discerned; (3) the tendency to confusion in the mental current of suggestion & mechanical opposition in the body leading to delay of obedience or deviation from the time, place & circumstance enjoined; (4) the tendency for adverse circumstance to interfere & divert the faultless or generally successful fulfilment begun. However, the frequency of obedience & frequent exactness of the action show the emergence of the successful Shakti. It is notable that both these activities are confined in their success for the most part to the immediate hap- penings around me of a trifling nature. In the rest there is only a general pressure and ultimate success and a capricious success in details. The therapeutic power has evidently gained in force. The vijnanamaya articulate thought had established its free activity regardless of all doubt & opposition in the mind, but it had not decisively proved its truth & vijnanamaya nature by unvarying result in the objective & subjective happenings of Yoga & life; but this movement of proof has now powerfully commenced.

The second chatusthaya is preparing its liberation in the defective points (kalyanasraddha, faith in the adesha, ishwarabhava, etc), but as yet only the sraddha in the yoga siddhi is decisively fulfilled. The reason in the annamaya mind opposes the perfect sraddha, the damyam in the annamaya temperament opposes the ishwarabhava. July 4th The lipi is not yet entirely conquered by the Satyam. Especially when the doubt about the adesha siddhi rises, it gives or suggests false prophecies but the falsehood is usually noted, now, at the time & no longer deceives. Todays notable lipis (1) Fullest satisfaction of the heart next after the fulfilment of the laughter (hasyam). It is notable that the fulfilment of hasyasid- dhi has recently been predicted with great persistence by the lipi “laughter”, which I could not then understand. Cf the old lipi, “Safety” (2) Ekas tisthati viras tisthati. (3) Sadi Carnot. (4) Disorder at once; yes. The last script had reference to the prolonged attack on the first two chatusthayas & also on the new siddhis of the third which had produced in the annam some disorder, mental activity & vague uneasiness; it predicted the immediate removal of the disorder by restoration of passivity & was at once fulfilled. The attack lasted or recurred throughout the day until this script appeared with its immediate fulfilment. The vividness, frequency & simultaneity of the lipi have now been established in fixity, with continuity; but are not yet invariable or intense. Different forms of lipi, chhayamay, varnamaya are be- coming more frequent (called in the prophetic script lipikaushalya). Along with this successful issue from a long & weary struggle the details of the lipi are becoming more & more independent of men- tal activity, eg le resultat decisif where the annamaya mind had blunderingly suggested decisive; the words suggested by the mental thought voice are increasingly rejected and other unexpected words substituted even when the lipi appears progressively and not with an"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"84 Record of Yoga unexpected spontaneity; etc. Automatic script recommenced today showed a greater truthfulness in the few statements made about the next movements of the yoga but is still capable of exaggeration. The vani has not yet entirely established its satyam to the mind. It is still taking up all imperative thought-voices suggestive of action & the articulate Thought is taking up all voices suggestive of knowledge. When this movement proceeds, there is a slight return to the old inefficiency of phrase, ambiguity of statement or exaggeration of suggestion; but these faults are only reproduced to be removed & not, as used to be the case, to have bhoga & be exhausted. The siddhis of power progress steadily. One of the difficulties is now removed; the power hits its mark, & where unfavourable circumstances intervene, favourable circumstances have begun to appear to counteract them. But refusal, delay & perversion are still common. Those on whom the power is used for progress in Yoga (S. [Srinivasachari] Bh. [Bharati] Sn. [Saurin] Bj. [Bijoy]) give frequent proofs now of success of siddhi & especially of vyapti of the shakti & jnanam in my or of my thoughts, but this siddhi is not yet decisively regularised. Mental bhukti is now complete (with the exception of adverse events where there is more of samata than bhukti) & is invariable in rasagrahanam, usual in bhoga and, nowadays, occasional as ananda. But the shuddha ananda attended by the realisation of universal saundaryam often fails temporarily, owing to the loss of hold on the inner man and the dwelling on the physical appearance instead, when this happens, and it happens only with regard to human faces, there is a fall in the general tone of the bhukti which tends to lose hold of the second & third intensities of bhoga (r ˆ atha & ratna) and descend to the rati or lowest intensity or else even to go back from bhoga to mere rasagrahana. But the lapse is never long sustained. Physical bhukti of the indriyas is well established except for the occasional failure of chakshush ananda in the movement above described and a failure in certain tastes of the palate, the latter exceptional. Sparshananda is still confined mainly to the low state of the rati, though well capable of the higher states, and is hampered by the persistence of discomfort by prolonged exposure to excessive"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"1–25 July 1912 85 heat, exposure to cold above a certain degree in the state of sleep or after sleep when the nervous vitality is lowered, the intenser touches of pain or poisonous irritation. Thirst is being once more expelled, but hunger is again active. The five physical anandas oc- cur occasionally sahaituka, but the ahaituka activities have for the time being been suspended along with progress in the other physical siddhis. Sleep is strong, also adhogati of weariness, denial of anima, refusal of the saundaryam, persistence of the stray survivals of the phantasm of illness-symptoms. These seem, however, to be losing all hold except on the stomach & central functions, where they are attempting to resist final eviction (fullness, tejasic unease, touches of nausea) or to prevent fixity of siddhi. Visrishti is stronger than it has been for a long time past. Utthapana of neck maintained for about 10 or 15 minutes, finally overcome by pressure of adhogati. July 5 t . h . &6 t . h . A day of considerable and constant progress. Two predictions were made during its course of the progress apportioned to it, the first in script after an opening activity of telepathy and thought- reading, the second in thought and perception. The script ran, “More advance in vyapti & prakamya of thought; decisive effect in siddhi of rupadrishti. Progress in visvagati. Physical siddhi in 6. 7 & 8 (secondary)”. The prediction was fulfilled, but perfunctorily without any generosity or amplitude of effect. It was replaced by the second prediction which promised the beginning of a second totality of the third chatusthaya on a larger scale & with a stronger effectiveness heralded by the extension of trikaldrishti, prakamya, vyapti and the siddhis of power to things distant in place & time and a preparation of totality in the fourth & fifth chatusthayas. There has long been a free & successful telepathy (vyapti) & reading (prakamya) of the characters, feelings & states of mind of others and for longer still an elementary perception & vyapti of their actions. But the thought contents of the minds of others have been hidden from me except occasionally or in abnormal states of my being when it was concentrated in anger, apprehension or sympathy.

Today, however, the veil was lifted, the barrier finally broken. Not only did telepathy & thought-reading abound, but in a single day the proof of correctness began to be ample. Things distant in time & place have also begun to yield up the secret of their present, future & immediate past, even in the rough of their distant past. Proofs have simultaneously begun to be vouchsafed. Things have even been perceived, denied by the object of the drishti or by apparent events & then proved in spite of denial on more ample evidence. Nevertheless the action is not yet perfectly free; the power of ob- struction in the annamaya nature can no longer entirely prevail, but the will persists. Trikaldrishti is still hampered by revivals of the lower movement, when incorrect suggestion resumes for a short time its sway. There are also elements of error in the successful movement, mostly of the nature of mithyagraha or mithyaropa, misconception by which a tendency or passing thought is taken for an intention or an intention for the thing that will happen etc and misplacement by which the thought or action of one is taken for the thought or action of another or falsely placed in time, locality or order of circumstance.

Experience of perfect unity of shamas, prakasha & tapas first in trikaldrishti, then in action. It was found that the sole error (of final result) in a particular drishti was owing to haste of mental tapas taking the main tendency or intention as the thing that was bound to happen. The right details were given by vyapti-prakamya of the immediate future, but were not accepted by the mind till they were fulfilled. The tapas is not yet chanda. A great & supreme passivity remains in which traigunyamaya utsaha and nirveda try to subsist discouraging as yet the tapas and prakasha. Only shamas is, as yet, entirely victorious. There is no longer any attempt by the manasa buddhi to forecast action; it recognises the impotence of speculation. Ananda Mimansa begun last night; the first adhyaya completed this morning. The proof of preparation of beauty in a very initial stage has during the last few days at last begun to appear.

Premananda based on realisation of God as every separate existence animate or inanimate re-becomes, suddenly active and strong. General trikaldrishti but without proper arrangement or nishchaya therefore groping & incorrect in detail is becoming normal. The Shakti has begun to move towards normality of cor- rect detail. Power applied more perseveringly to the bodily siddhi seems to be producing more consistent results. The apana is being dominated, resistance to saundaryam relaxed, urdhwagati tending to recover from its prostration. Three longstanding aishwaryas were fulfilled yesterday & today in public events. Continuity of record promises to become more common in the samadhi.

They have an air of being pratisthita. Only the nirvisesha sharirika anandas are intermittent and obstructed. The nirvisesha shuddha & premabhoga are, how- ever, still dependent on the perfect realisation of Sarvavastushu Ishwara. There is strong tendency to deposit of prithivi & visrishti, & if the apana is dominated by the prana, it is as one who still successfully struggles with his assailant. The same is true of all the physical siddhis that have at all advanced, they are attacking, sometimes prevailing, sometimes in possession, but not yet masters except in the suddhi, bhukti & mukti (the latter most imperfect of the three). Yesterday by a sudden opening of faculty Sanscrit prose, even of the Kadambari type, which was until the last reading difficult to understand, troublesome & wearying to the brain, has become perfectly easy & intelligible at the first reading without labour. A similar result is coming in Sanscrit poetry but more slowly. Prakasha & tapas in the brain have increased, tamas is passing away. It is now apparent that kama was greatly strengthened yester- day & karma in bhava and power, but not, apparently, in actuality. The experience of the afternoon shows that ananda is not yet beyond effective breach by the nirananda & that the samata- hasyam, though now normal, can still be interrupted, the traigunya become once more active feebly in rajas & by the use of force on the Jiva in his system, but strongly in tamas & with the consent of the Jiva. The old device of insisting, against the Jivas will, on flattering statement & promise which no longer seems supported by experience, has again been used. The exact trikaldrishti accurate in every detail or almost every detail seems to be becoming more normal, but is still very far from being habitual or even common; but it does not need so exceptional a movement of tapas as formerly; it comes, when it comes, easily & naturally The central chakra was stronger than ever before for a short time this morning & almost perfect in type, but collapsed under pressure.

It is now suggested that the predictions were not in them- selves intended to indicate the actual fulfilment during the day but the occupation of the shakti with these things during the day & afterwards. In this case it will be a general programme, rather than a prediction. But it was preceded by a phrase which fixed the understanding in the mind in a different sense. The attack of asiddhi in the afternoon was not entirely lifted during the day, especially in the intelligence (buddhi) which re- mained under the control of the tamas. Rupadrishti of ghana & developed form was active for a time, but the drishti still sub- ject to the old defect, the vivid is unstable & the stable dim or ill-defined. July 15 th This morning Samata is perfectly restored and there is a strong increase of the suddhananda with a manifestation of the faery ele- ment in the beauty of things, the sense of their beauty of ananda, the pleasure taken in them as visions of his weaving of God.

Kali Krishna (finality of mental dasyam and sraddha in the guidance, not in the truth of everything stated.) 6. Karma & kama increase. 7. Trikaldrishti notably, powers less, samadhi somewhat developed. The fifth has been immediately fulfilled; the personality of the balaka Krishna has taken possession of the sources of knowledge and communicates through the vani & vani script & even through the thought and the lipi; only the perceptions still belong to the Prakriti. The bala bhava (with a touch of the balaka) is established in the Shakti. The general tendency to kamananda & sharirananda is in- creased & more persistent but does not yet pervade & hold the body, but only moves about it in brief & rapid wave-movements. The weakness of the nabhi chakra is the chief obstacle Rupadrishti increases and instances of perfect dense crude & dense developed have manifested, but the latter are without stability. Shuddhananda is universal; questioned at first by the objection of physical ugliness, it has been liberated by the perception of the faery grotesque, the place of the crude, the unformed, the uncouth & the fantastic in the scheme of the universal beauty. The vulgar is the effaced and has the charm of that effacement. The movement of the intellect in difficult Sanscrit poetry is much easier and stronger & sometimes the vijnanamay knowledge manifests (smarta sruti) with regard to the meaning of unknown words.

In the trikaldrishti freedom of movement and the frequency of the sruti (which occupies at present all the means of knowledge along with the smriti) are now established, unhampered by the purely provisional nature of the sraddha conceded. This sraddha proceeds from the imagination, heart & general judgment but is refused by the buddhi which trusts only the smriti & drishti, where there is no prominence of sruti. Prakamya-vyapti is strong & fre- quently or even generally justified. The powers are not yet acting noticeably. Lipi (earlier). “In four days trikaldrishti will be perfect.” Trikaldrishti is being finally liberated from the tejasic move- ment which instead of waiting for knowledge & allowing it to come, tries to find out & fix the truth, preferring speculation to sight. The general correctness of the trikaldrishti was first made quite normal in those movements which closely follow the incident from step to step as it [proceeds], 5 then in the prediction of the event before it begins; afterwards precise correctness of detail was brought to the level of a normal movement (not invariable, but natural, easy & frequent). Next the powers were applied to detail first of time, then of place, then of circumstance and precision of fulfilment was made normal; but the resistance here is greater & renders success less frequent. By several lipis the extension of the siddhi to trailokyadrishti was promised for the day, especially in samadhi. The first step was to attach a perception to rupas seen of their meaning & cir- cumstances. Subsequently in samadhi a series of visions of Patala occurred, brief but some of them representing continuous incidents & scenes, eg, a ghat of many hundred steps descending to an abysmal river, small watersnakes darting through a river, all the scenes in shadow or dimness.

Knowledge by sruti has begun to be proved & accepted. The process of finally manifesting the trikaldrishti in things distant has begun, the automatic unsought knowledge proving always truer than the mental opinions, infer- ences etc. The increased strength of the kamachakra strongly tested last night, has endured the test so far.

In the evening, however, there was a brief intense movement. After a violent struggle the powers pre- vailed over resistance in the evening. Trikaldrishti, likewise. Both attempted to move forward beyond normal action to invariability, but after a time the attempt was suspended. Trailokyadrishti was active, especially in the samadhi, rupadrishti also, but in the chitra, sthapatya & cruder forms and no advance was made. Samadhi advanced considerably. Yesterdays lipi, “story” explained at the time as the connected tracing out of a story in the night in dream- samadhi was fulfilled.

This is especially the case in the trikaldrishti that is not of prakamya vyapti in its nature but independently revelatory. It is now proved beyond doubt that the mind invents nothing, but merely transmits, records and interprets, & interpretation not being its proper function is more liable to misinterpret than to understand correctly.

In this connection it is evident that there is still a slight tejasic influence in the vani colouring the truth with the prepossessions. There is strong resistance to the therapeutic power. The promise of equipment does not materialise. The obstruction to the physical siddhi is stubborn. Even the vijnana is faltering & “mesquin” in its action although increasingly general in its truth & frequency. These are the main helps of the tamasic intelligence. The trikaldrishti is already stronger in its action, though the confused method of working out the details from uncertainty to partly approximate partly complete correctness still continues. The siddhis of power are evidently much stronger & are overbearing in the field of exercise all the resistance brought against them; the only defect is that time is needed &, if time is not given, the prayoga is apt to be fruitless. In the field of life there are plenty of instances of success, but the power of offering a strong & successful resistance still belongs to the annamaya prakriti.

The sixth chatusthaya was ren- dered vivid & invariable, the fourfold Brahman being seen every- where in the whole & in each object, very vividly, except when the mind is not free. There is a state in which the infinity of the mind is clouded by preoccupation with a particular idea or subject; the sense of freedom, prakash (transparent luminousness) & lightness is replaced by obscurity & a heavy contraction in the guna of narrowness. This is a remnant of the buddha con- dition. There is another in which there is a particular movement in mind (special occupation), but the mind itself is infinite[,] free & merely watches its own movement. This is mukti with particular tapas. The second chatusthaya reemerged in the evening bringing with it a restoration of force & faith (not complete), but this reemergence was clouded afterwards. Health was much stronger, but perfect assimilation is still disputed by the apana, though the latter no longer produces distention of flatulence, but only tries to limit food-capacity, maintain the slowness of assimilation & restore the visrishti which has been discontinued for four days; the jalavisrishti is very strong and insistent. Nirvisesha kamananda in its intenser form, but not so intense as it was at times, is normal & frequent, but not long continued. The vyapti prakamya is becoming more decisive & intense. Samadhi is attacking the discontinuity & momentariness of the visible record, thought record has already the power of continuity.

Sleep at night, which is tamasic, increases denial of utthapana, moral tamas, strength of apana & all asiddhi; sleep by day, which is strongly charged with samadhi, refreshes & is inclined to be brief. It is evident that the sleep which attacks has its stronghold in the karmadeha and not in the actual body. Saundaryabodha & Ananda in the outside world are now per- fectly established, but relics of asamata remain and momentary tendencies of mental revolt touch the prana & chitta & sometimes the buddhi, 3\u0017vA EvlFy\u0001t\u0011 . Kalibhava is strong, but has not taken possession of the speech where the old sanskar is powerful. Krishna seems sometimes to remove himself and look out from behind a veil. This presence & absence in myself with its results reveals Christs state of mind when he complained of being forsaken by God. This is salokya, sayujya is when there is the same feeling of presence, but of God in contact with us or embracing the soul from outside, not of being in us & part of us, thought different &yetthe same. Sadharmya is well established, but not perfect because of insufficient Ishwarabhava. The relation of Purushottama, Akshara Purusha and Kshara Purusha (Jivatma) is now constantly & vividly seen by me in others more than in myself, although just now it is manifesting in myself. In myself the Purushottama & Kshara Purusha are most vivid to me, in others the Jivatman & Akshara Purusha, while in the world at large (jagati), it is the Purushottama containing the other two in Himself & almost engulfing them they seem to be merely movements of the Purushottama, parts, layers, aspects of His personality, as indeed they really are. This is because in the jagati & indeed in inanimate beings there is not the ahankara in the buddhi to create a sense of difference. Being more strongly aware of my own remnants of ahankara than that of others, or, rather being more troubled by my awareness the Akshara Purusha is less manifest to me than in others, in whom I see the ahankara only as a play of Srikrishna and am not disturbed by it.

Sleep was re- duced to four hours and a half at night, none in the day. Nirvisesha kamananda became insistent & long continuous in the evening & up till 11 pm, but its first intensity was not maintained. It has, however, always a tendency to thrill & chandata or tivrata which was absent to the inceptual manifestation. The general tendency is strong & persistent. The signs of development of saundaryam are becoming clearer and more decisive, but none is as yet victoriously emergent; though one or two are on the point of it. Scenes of the future in samadhi are manifesting & nearer to the antardarshi jagrat condition which has long been deprived of all but very dim images. There is a frequent replacement of perception of sthula by perception of prana values eg a strong, almost vio- lent pranamaya oscillation (throbbing & swaying) physically felt in chair & table when the physical chair & table were only given a slight vibration by a gentle motion of one seated on the table. The chair although detached from the table & connected only through my body shared strongly in the pranamaya disturbance. The senses tend to confuse the two & feel the chair and table physically mov- ing, but the viveka having taken possession of the manas prevent[s] the sensations from succumbing to the error of the physical sense. The most important & decisive results were in the second and sixth chatusthayas. The Mahakali bhava in Mahasaraswati continent, after being clouded for some time, finally revealed itself as perfectly established and is developing the permanent ugrata, ishwarabhava etc; the ishwarabhava is tending to become indepen- dent of the results of activity & to consist in the force & confidence of the activity itself and of the personality manifesting. But also in the trikaldrishti sruti is insisting on self-justification and increasing the self-existent faith which is independent of the misleading twists & turns of immediate result & event. The Mahalakshmi bhava, hitherto absent, is now tending to appear. At first it replaced mo- mentarily the Mahakali which it is intended only to colour without altering its character, afterwards it tended to bring the Mahalaxmi- Mahasaraswati combinations, but eventually it has subordinated itself to the proper Chandibhava. The Mahakali bhava tends to be"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102 Record of Yoga weakened, but no longer blotted out by the old sanskaras in con- versation & after sleep; but it is no longer replaced by Maheshwari- Mahasaraswati, but by an improperly combined quadruple bhava. The Maheshwari (Gauri) pratistha is still too prominent, because the habit of exciting mental tapas, against which the pratistha is an insurance, still lingers, though weakly, as a habit that always revives with the advent of Mahakali. The permanent realisation of the fourfold Brahman is final. The activity of shuddhi, mukti, bhukti is now final in all their parts, though not yet consummate; only the siddhi remains and this is being rapidly brought forward. It is still chiefly hampered in the karma proper to Mahakali & in the outward fulfilment of kama. July 23 d .. Today is the day long fixed for the fullness of the third cha- tusthaya apart from the two later chatusthayas, in so far as its action can be complete without being entirely effective in kama, karma & the body. It is also the day when the movement towards that effectiveness begins. Siddhi of power today is working instanta- neously & in detail & the action of all the powers is normal, regular, effective, invariably employed as the chief & proper instrument, but not yet entirely perfect in detail. Bhautasiddhi is working, but still overpowered by adhogati, nor likely to be free till general uttha- pana overcomes adhogati. Samadhi is still deficient in continuity of visible record. It is supposed that it will round itself off today. The vijnana is now working with force & applying itself both in knowledge & shakti to things of moment. The physical siddhi is engaged in fighting down the tamasic obstruction. Yesterday only a little literary karma was done, as previously announced, nor will anything be done today. The activity of lipi & rupa, almost sus- pended for a time, is now reviving. In trailokyagati the mind seems to be standing on the doorstep of the pranamaya. Nirvisesha kama Ananda throughout the day was active & the general tendency continuous.

There was still an oscillation between imperfect tejasic action and karmahin udasinata. This has now been expelled by associating the Mahakali bhava with the karma. The second chatusthay is imperfectly founded in sraddha; the third yet insecure, deficient in sani ; the fourth not yet established; the fifth only incipient.

The tejas is the chief obstacle to the fulfilment in permanence and completeness of the vijnana-siddhi. The confused remnants of the tejas are being progressively expelled, & the trikaldrishti, jnana and prakamya vyapti are growing steadily & methodically, but without enthusiasm or any positive ananda, in precision, cor- rectness & range. This misplacement of circumstance, due to the tejasic attempt in the manas tattwa to fix things instead of seeing them as they are, is diminishing in insistence & effect. In the body tamas, not tejas is the chief enemy, as the nature of the annamaya is tamasic, just as the nature of the manomaya is tejasic. Anandasiddhi has been reconstituted, the shuddhi & mukti & bhukti with the samata, but the perfection of the second cha- tusthaya is still to seek. The reason is that although there is sraddha now in the Yoga and in God, there is not sufficient sraddha in the Lilamaya Purusha, & therefore none in the increasing rapidity of the siddhi or in the inevitable and perfect fulfilment of the Adesha."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"12 October–26 November 1912 107 Nov 10th The Script is now liberated from imperfection. The trikaldrishti is only imperfect from confusion of details & broken relics of the old tejasic overhaste accompanied by sugges- tions from phantasms of the dead devatas. The shakti-prayog suffers only by the prematureness of the Mahakali kshiprakarita. The samadhi is only obscured by the imperfect dharanashakti of the material mind. The defect of anima is prolonged by the tamas in the body. These imperfections have to be eliminated. The physical siddhi is yet subject to relapse & temporary dislocation. The subjective foundations of the Adeshasiddhi are now com- plete, but not yet perfect in solidity, power & range. Its instruments are still imperfectly organised & insufficiently effective in applica- tion. Samata siddhi, sraddha, virya, shakti, are perfect except for the defective spot in the Sraddha through which the asiddhi can still enter. Nov 12th A period of resistance & denial, ending in revolt, is over now (4.30 pm) & the dasyam emerges from it perfected. The dasyam being perfected, the internal ananda will become stable, subject only to depression by the imperfect sraddha, & the tejas permanently reestablish itself. Knowledge & Power will follow as the result of consistent tejas & saundaryam as the result of physical ananda. The whole will be summed up in Bhoga & Amritam.

Nov 13. The dasyam and internal ahaituka ananda being now perma- nently assured, the tejas has to be made equally firm and continu- ous. For this purpose the sraddha has to be perfectly restored and this must first be done in the trikaldrishti, aishwarya & ishita. These must be made infallible. At present the perception of possibilities interferes with the perception of actualities which would otherwise be perfect. The aishwaryaprayoga is now free of false tejas & the only obstacle is the sluggishness of the Akasha. From today both trikaldrishti & shakti will become infallible, although there will be returns & survivals for a time of error & failure.

The doubt comes to be one of Gods guidance & the reality of the Adesha. The science of Yoga is justified, but the idea of the personal mission seems to be convicted of essential falsity. Meanwhile the particular siddhis established maintain themselves ordinarily, but do not progress. Only the sahitya proceeds smoothly & seems to develop in security.

It is only in the exact order of circumstances, time & place that there is real error. The rest is only a misplacement of prakamya & vyapti of intention & tendency in place of trikal- drishti. The Shakti is effective, but under the same limitations more heavily stressed. In both these respects the next three days will see a great change, but especially in the first & in lipi & rupa.

Besides, the ideas of what will happen or is the case in little details of the occurrences in the house are usually correct, but not always. The trend is to the satyam intellectual infallibility, for the direct vijnanamay action is still held back in order to allow the mind to contract the habit of correctness, ie of not disfiguring by misapplication the truth from the vijnana. The rupadrishti grows in strength and the bodily condition is turning towards improvement by lessening of the tamas of adhogati (sranti).

Nov 29 The dispersion of the clouds foreseen yesterday morning as destined to happen today the first thing in the morning, took place suddenly at the time indicated, although the whole sky was dark & heavy till that moment. All yesterday the skies were heavily over- cast but there was no rain. This also had been foreseen. The spell of entirely cloudy weather has lasted, allowing for one imperfect break, exactly the time predicted & foreseen some eight or ten days before, viz three days. There will be still flying clouds & temporary spells. For some days there have been continual proofs of vyapti prakamya. eg the presence of an Austrian warship at Durazzo, the rumour of the Austrian consul being killed, etc. Yesterday there came in the mind the positive idea that Turkey had asked to be included in the Balkan Confederacy; today the same is given (in yesterdays evening paper reaching here this morning), as a strange piece of news from Constantinopl e and Sofia. This is striking as there was neither data nor probability & the knowledge, of the fact or rumour, came suddenly without previous thinking in that direction.

Vyapti and prakamya are now abundant, continuous and almost perfect in arrangement, ie in assignment of its source & nature. Fresh rain in the evening foreseen & also the stages by which the break was overcome; but in the interval there was much uncer- tainty owing to a fresh stratum of the karmadeha (sthulapranavad annam). There is frequent unease & the equivalent of ashanti in the body & the anna-kosha & the chitta is clouded, but the mind is calm. (N.B The body is only the centralised part of the annakosha.) Power is still successfully resisted, but not so successfully as before. eg the motion of a kite through the sky followed by the trikaldrishti and each fresh movement seen; while steadily describing straight flight & minimum gyre (from right to left) in succession, thus , willed that it should turn to the right in the middle of the gyre & resume the straight line. This was done in the next gyre, the bird hesitating for a moment before it obeyed, thus . At night, the first arrival was correctly predicted at 8.10 (8.11 was the actual time) but not, firmly, the person. There was much confusion, many guesses by the intellect about the order of the persons & the order finally fixed on, was entirely wrong. Only it was correctly seen that none would come before eight or after nine. An arrival was fixed at 8.22, but another occurrence took place at 8.22. In other words, the correct times are suggested to the very minute, but the wrong circumstances are frequently attached by the intellect. It is in the intellect striving to do the work of the vijnana, & not in or from the vijnana direct that these perceptions come; but in the intellect only so much can be done as has been already established by the vijnana, & it has not as yet established correctness of circumstance. Therefore the vijnana this night has been made once more active and is carrying on the siddhi. The separate activity of the intellect occurs, as before, only as an element of imperfection or in interregnal periods. The ahaituka kamananda, with great difficulty, became again active at moments, but its continuance is strongly obstructed. The sahaituka physical anandas are once more tivra."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"122 Record of Yoga There is an entire disappearance in the prana of the tejasic sraddha, ie hasty & excessive belief which turns into exaggerated expectation, & a great strength of samata even in the karmadeha, whence only a vague physical uneasiness comes into the subtle part of the body in place of the old disappointment and despondency in the manahkosha. The reaction of anger in the karmadeha is no longer violent, but only a subdued, though at times a strong irritation, which being no longer able to insist, soon disappears. The body, however, is disappointed & tamasic. There has been excessive sleep (7 hours or more) for the last three nights. It is predicted that from tomorrow Place as well as Time will begin to be accurate. Nov 30. Rapidity only in the Veda-jnana . The place is beginning to be accurate, but the arrangement is not yet perfect. eg. a bird flying is observed, all the turns of movement are accurately predicted, but not always in their proper order; one turn is omitted or another too soon expected etc. Occasionally a momentary impulse in the bird or in the force that is driving it, is taken for a destined movement, but this source of error, which used to be dominant, is now very weak in its incidence & occasional in its occurrence... B [Bijoy] is now responding rapidly to the suggestions of the Power in the siddhi- prayoga, but still needs too much the aid of speech. His purity & mukti from dwandwa is perfect except in the karmadeha & the preparation of mukti from ahankara is being completed. Vijnana in the intellect, jnanam, in him is very strong, but not yet turned towards trikaldrishti. Prakamya & vyapti are well developed but not perfect. The other siddhis in him work fitfully.

Clash of ahankaras over B; first sign of a fresh move- ment forward so far as he is concerned. December 1 s . t . Teja, tapas & prakasha are now coalescing into a harmony; power is increasing in small matters towards perfection of detail, but the movement is only in its initial stage. This initial movement was foreseen & the time fixed three days ago. The perception of the various & subtly shaded significance in lipi & rupa-symbol is perfected; but the rupadrishti itself is manifesting slowly. Images in the akasha are frequently perfect, but when perfect never stable except in very crude forms & that only because of the past strong development in crude images on the lines of perfection by effort which belonged to the initial & mediary stages of the sadhan. Com- parative helplessness in the therapeutic power in certain directions, & always only a slow and gradual process. This afternoon clear & vivid lipi finally emerged from the akasha and the rupa in the crude forms shows a tendency to es- tablished stability while the old forms of rupa, sthapatya, saurya, manasa are reemerging in their old perfection. Instantaneous de- veloped rupa is becoming more frequent, but vanishes with the instant. Faith in the vani, lipi & rupa is established except for outside immediate events & the adesha siddhi, in which field faith in the trikaldrishti is not yet firm. Except in this field, tejasic will has separated itself from trikaldrishti & vyaptiprakamya of intention or tendency is no longer adopted as vyaptiprakamya of event or as trikaldrishti of the event. Therefore, if the unoccupied or rather ill-occupied field can be occupied, the perfection of trikaldrishti is within sight. Rapidity of progress promised in lipi & vani for some days past, is now beginning, not only in the Veda, but in the third chatusthaya also. Samata is perfect, tejas is establishing itself, jnana is full & active."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"124 Record of Yoga December 3 d .. Yesterday was a day of external suspension, almost of recoil. In the evening only the positive siddhi began to remanifest, but negatively the remnants of the impure tejasic elements in the kar- madeha were [ ] 1 farther eliminated & weakened. On the other hand, the new tejas has increased & grows on the buddhi which is admitting the subjective conditions of the adeshasiddhi, eg the Asura & Rakshasa bhavas of Mahakali, but not the probability of the siddhi itself in this life. Kamananda though it comes, has not overcome the opposition to its intensity & permanence. The higher material forms of lipi, in which vividness, simultaneity & amplitude are now gained, are beginning to manifest spontaneously. Only per- fect spontaneity is lacking as yet to the perfected lipi. Rupadrishti is still held back at the point of development it had reached. Unstable developed images, stable images of a great crudity occur. Swapna Samadhi, night before last, gained a greater frequency of single & grouped image, but is still unable to develop long continuity of one series of events, which only occurs in purified swapna. Fresh proofs of trikaldrishti come daily, but the habitual invariability of correctness is not yet attained. A mixed action is the ordinary level, unvarying correctness only happens when the vijnana is in full vigour. The sky is once more clouded. This renewal of clouded weather in December had been foreseen, but not its date or even its approximate time. Sleep for two nights has been restricted, of its own motion, to six hours or a little over. The karmadeha is physically full of tamas and an effect is produced on the material body which is slow to work & does not easily respond to the demand for new siddhi; but the bhauta-siddhi is showing some signs of improvement and there is no actual collapse of the tapas, but only sluggishness in physical pravritti. Rupadrishti has emerged still farther. The Akasha today has been given the tendency to reject imperfect forms, & now in the sukshma layer of this annakasha fairly stable perfect forms of birds have begun to appear in all the crude forms & some of the ghana 1 MS were"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"26 November–31 December 1912 125 and developed; but not yet the pronounced developed forms.... Certain contacts once painful are losing their discomfort in the raudra vishayananda . . Kamananda appears in increasing force. There are now only a few categories of events which create a mixed ananda or recall the old reactions of depression & recoil. The vani is being justified in all its immediate predictions, & the script vani has disappeared. The mornings news all go farther in the direction of fulfilment. Shaktiprayoga in detail is still strongly resisted, though it sometimes prevails partially or completely, but not when there is a question of exact time & place or circumstance. Trikaldrishti is hampered by the attempt in the environment at infallibility of the mere intellect. This external intellectual sugges- tion usually is the first thing that comes & is generally erroneous, although, formerly, being specially guided it was often correct. This applies almost entirely to the question of detail. In the broad idea there is a greater correctness. It is now in the personal environment and not in the karmadeha that the subjective asiddhi acts. The following programme has been given in script, but it is not yet certain that it is correct.

The spontaneity of the vivid & simultaneous lipi has begun today, as predicted, both in Chitra and Akash. The step forward in [Rupa] 2 was only the appearance of chaya & tejas akashic crude forms on a background, strong in material and distinct but not sharp in outline. Kama Ananda increased in intensity & frequency. Dec 4 t . h . 9.30 am. There is a farther movement of exhaustion of the environment, but the tejasic movement hampering the trikaldrishti refuses to be evicted & it is still only by waiting that the trikaldrishti can be got right. Ambiguous and misleading combinations in vani & lipi (immediate) still occur, though as an exception. Frequency of Kamananda continues and tends to increase, but is not prolonged as it was once yesterday. Death of S.As [Srinivasacharis] child. It was brought to me on the 29 t . h or 30 th Nov. On the 1 s . t . I had the trikaldrishti of its death; this was repeated three times in Lipi, “death[”], and confirmed in Vani Script “The child will die.” On the 2 d I got the vyapti of an improvement, confirmed by R [Ramaswamy], but at the same time the trikaldrishti that the improvement would be immediately followed by death. This has now been confirmed by the event. There was one imperfection, a suggestion from outside and a hope within, growing almost into confidence, that the trikaldrishti, in spite of so many confirmations, might not be true. Nevertheless, there came a warning not to indulge the hope, but wait the event. Today there is to be final fulfilment of the spontaneity of the lipi. (Written on the 5 th ) This has been fulfilled, although at first the fulfilment was attended by a swift & violent obstruction first to the appearance of the lipi, next to its spontaneity[,] thirdly to its vividness, fourthly, to its completeness, fullness of sentence & sep- aration of different lipis.

Moreover, it is now moving towards the elimination of imperfect lipi altogether. At the same time the tejas has become constant & indifferent to failure, even to continued and persistent failure. The opposition now comes not from the personal environ- ment, but from the Dasyus in the outside world and they fight not close (anti), but dure, from a distance. Their effort is to pre- serve the obstruction, to prevent Ananda from establishing itself and to enforce Asraddha by defeating the Adeshasiddhi. As re- gards the Ananda they have now (the 4 th night & 5 th ) definitely failed. There is ahaituka Ananda well-established, even in spite of asraddha. In other words, the depression caused by the with- holding of the Adesha-siddhi is so reduced in effectiveness that it can only now limit the Ananda and not any longer prevent its manifestation. Rupadrishti was confirmed only to the extent of other crude forms appearing in the Akasha and on the background. Trikal- drishti acts once more, after its temporary clouding, but the con- fusion of the avaraka tamas is not yet removed and the tejasic intellectual action maintained from outside by the enemy is not extruded. It is possible that perfect trikaldrishti may be beginning to evolve its normal as opposed to its exceptional action, but this cannot yet be confidently asserted. Dec. 5 t . h . Lipi. Today is the last day of the imperfect tejas. It has been predicted that the scholastic work will be done in future not by the intellect but by the Vijnanam. This has begun to be fulfilled, and the remaining difficulties in the Veda are beginning to vanish. It has also been asserted that no work will in future be allowed which is confused in its impulse & subject to tamasic interruption.

Sraddha is increasing in the rapidity of the subjective- objective Yogasiddhi, but not yet, with stability, in that of the Adesh siddhi, except in literature. Todays news show a perfect action of the Shakti in detail on events of magnitude at a distance eg. the terms given to Turkey, the separation of Greece from the allies, the signing of the armistice, the attitude of the Powers. The pronounced defect, now, is in imme- diate & near events concerned with the actual Adeshasiddhi itself, rather than with the development of the necessary powers. The moulding of men proceeds subjectively, but not with accuracy of detail, except in occasional & unregulated fulfilments, nor is there yet any freedom & mastery. The equipment has, hitherto, entirely [failed] 3 except for small, fortuitous & temporary successes, just preventing entire collapse. The guidance from above seems now to be free from the neces- sity of any longer managing & giving rein to the forces of Anritam. Its final emergence from the action of the Mechanician, the Yantri, mending & testing His machine & self-revelation as that of the God of Truth & Love, began definitely to be worked out from 18 t . h .

This is the third message (18 Oct 1912) “Make complete sannyasa of Karma. Make complete sannyasa of thought. Make complete sannyasa of feeling.

Last night there was once more a dream of the higher order. The dream divided itself into two parts, images seen, the record of an experience or vision in another world from which the spirit had returned & the intellectual effort of the mind to understand the record. The latter was, this time, absolutely perfect, a vision of a road along which I proceeded, met by men & women richly adorned & sumptuously clothed, a land where there was no ugliness or poverty, up to the meeting of this road by another at right angles to it from the left & between the two roads a great park with its gate near the crossways. The position of roads, gate & park was exactly that of the Baroda park, the Station or Racecourse Road & the Camp Road, but there was no other precise resemblance. There was even a vital difference, since I crossed a bridge before reaching the crossways, but the Baroda bridge over the Visvamitri is beyond the Park gates & not on this side. The mind, however, at once ran to the conclusion that this was Baroda. The speculation interrupted the vision. Afterwards the Park was again seen, but once more the reasonings of the mind interfered. Subsequently the mind became uncontrollably active & though Luxmi gave some clear records, it brought in so many cross ideas & images that at 5 The square brackets are Sri Aurobindos.

Never- theless continuity of record in deep sleep has at last been established after a long period of failure. The frequent & perfect combination of hearing, touch, taste & smell with sight in samadhi & dream is still wanting; for at present there is only occasional, though clear & intense, combined sight & hearing or sight & touch or hearing & touch, seldom all three together. Taste & smell are very rare. Afterwards there must be the actual experience of the spirits wanderings & not as now only subsequent records of them. This I had a long time ago in one or two instances, eg the Chhayamayi vision in Patala; but since then it has been discontinued. Finally, there must be the actual leaving of the body in trance, wholly or partially. There is a better & swifter subjective-objective response in others now to the vyapti & shakti prayoga; but it is still in its infant stages. Power is also telling on the bodies of others a little, eg. Bakhtyars sores heal almost at once; but this too is only in its commencement. Samata, shanti, sukha are perfect & only the nonfulfilment of Adesha-siddhi pr events freedom & fullness of the hasyam. The pressure of the eye on the akasha for developing imperfect rupas is being abandoned. All the di rections now are being faithfully followed. Trikaldrishti is extending itself once more into the distant future, being assured of a relative accuracy in the immediate. As yet, however, it lacks its proper pratistha in sraddha. Sleep for the last two night[s] has again risen to 7 hours or over. There is a movement towards the expulsion of sensibility to cold, which, once forcibly expelled, has for some time past returned and held the body. The habit in the akasha of the rupa disappearing if subjected to tratak is being eliminated; the more developed forms now appear and remain with some stability in the trataka, but their consistency is always crude and not firm & full. The perfect images appear commonly enough in the various akashas either before the physical eye or, more usually, outside its range of vision, to the side, above the brows or elsewhere, but they do not persist, although they recur & occasionally try to remain.

The obstruction continues, but cannot prevent the continued perfection & increasing range & sureness of the prakamya-vyapti. Only, it clouds the vijnana & then the trikaldrishti cannot act cer- tainly; it obstructs the Shakti-prayoga and brings about variation of failure & success; & it tries to disturb the system & prevent the growth of the physical siddhi and the samadhi. Nevertheless, the perfect response of the mind to trikaldrishti is growing & the Power is recovering its tone in all immediate circumstances; neither of them act perfectly in detail. The ordinary bhautasiddhi is recovering its tone & defect of anima does not seem to have so strong a hold as before; arogyasiddhi is resisting the attacks upon it and the physical ananda persists in spite of obstruction. The body, however, is still sensitive to cold; the violent ejection of this sensitiveness has been predicted (yesterday in lipi), but the movement is not yet successful. Last night sleep once again fell to six hours or possibly less. Swapna-samadhi grows in frequency & the combination of the vishayas is frequent & vivid, except in taste & smell, whose normal action in sleep is only being prepared. But the images & scenes are still fleeting & dream is disturbed in its continuity. The dream- images last night were of the old unreal kind & the air of unreality strong, but a connected series of events took place, coherent and reasonable, although unusual & only possible in a long past age with other manners. The events were correct, the images probably not all from the true record or free from present associations & figures, though there was no definite intrusion from the present. It was only the sense of self that belonged to the present. On the whole a considerable & steady progress. It is predicted that today will be a day of full progress; but the mornings indications are rather those of a half-successful obstruc- tion. These, however, may be & often are misleading. There is an evident movement towards the perfect arrangement"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"26 November–31 December 1912 133 of circumstances in the trikaldrishti. Eg. A passing glance vaguely takes in the ridge of a distant roof & is aware of something on the ridge; the first suggestion is that it is a bird, but it is felt that it is not a bird; then the suggestion is that it is the ridge alone & the impression of something on it is a misreading by the mind in the eye; but it is felt that there is something which will not stay there more than a moment. The mind remains confused between this false problem of bird or no bird. Then the eye is turned a second time on the object, with fixity this time, & the object is seen to be a squirrel motionless on the ridge, which immediately after leaps down from it. The whole confusion rises from the habit the mind has of seeing birds rather than any other object on the roofs & trees; otherwise everything would have been correct and in order. Immediately after, a butterfly is seen flying towards a tree. It is to pass on the other side of the tree, but there is prakamya- vyapti of an intended motion actually begun but checked, to this side, & the false suggestion comes that this intended motion will be effected; the suggestion is immediately rejected but not with- out a vyapti of the intention carried out simultaneously with the perception of it, to return to & continue the first line of flight. There is trikaldrishti of the right event, but not free from the in- trusion of falsity, & eventually not of so much value as it would have had if it were preliminary to & uninfluenced by the data of prakamya-vyapti.

This is being replaced by an effective prayoga belonging to the system, but still the time & order of circumstances is disturbed by its appearance without self- knowledge.

Power is also increasing rapidly; the will is sometimes fulfilled at the very moment, almost with the act of going out; at other times more slowly, but still with far greater force & frequency than has ever been the case in the past; sometimes, however, with great delay & difficulty & in some cases not at all. A curious example shows how difficult the resistance now finds it to be effective; a crow sitting on a branch received the suggestion of going to the end of the branch, but the force in it was unwilling; it went a little way thence came rapidly back, & for some minutes began dancing on the branch this way & that, towards the end when the force was applied, away from it when it was relaxed, until it reached the point as if driven suddenly by physical force, seeming several times about to fall off the tree, & then fluttered off to another bough.

Colour, jyotih & tejah are now common in all forms. The objective of the siddhi is to establish the habit of the perfect & stable image placed full before the vision; the object of the enemy is to preserve every possible imperfection & especially prevent stability. After some hours cessation, physical ananda of a much greater intensity was given for a short time, but not continued afterwards. Samadhi progresses slowly; but the dreams at night almost got rid of the element of dream-image & were only a series of mental images & ideas woven into a connected series of speech & incident. The elimination of dream image, is the first great desideratum, of inco- herence in thought record the second. In addition to these siddhis universal prema with the established chidghana & prema anan- das, rising into the suddha, are being again superimposed on the ahaituka.

Nine hours & more of walking & standing during the day failed to bring fatigue, but brought this time some amount of defect of anima. Sleep 6 hours and a half. Dec 7 th . 11.36 am. Nothing fresh has been added this morning; except that perfect forms of the crude variety are now more stable in the full line of the vision & more varied, eg varnamaya, agnimaya & jyotirmaya, but it is only the bird that so appears, usually as on a former occasion the redbreast. In the fleeting images some of which are of an absolute perfection, various kinds of birds, flags, ink & other bottles, books[,] matchboxes, cigarettes, cigarette packets etc, in a word, the objects most commonly observed are commonest. In this respect there is a strong contrast to the images seen in samadhi. The power is now being applied to movements in the mass where a number of agents are concerned. An effect is produced, especially at the beginning, but afterwards the resistance stiffens and is success- ful. Trikaldristi of exact time recommenced last night.

The combination of the subjective Anandas, sahaituka, is reestablished and almost perfect; but in one or two directions, eg ordure, massed sores & one or two kinds of events, jugupsa still comes in from the outside world & touches the external psychic nerves. There is also a persistence of hostile perception of ugliness which tries to take advantage of this or that object in order to deny the shuddhananda. Afternoon. The Power is now in small things fulfilling itself in exact cir- cumstance of place & order of circumstance, in isolated cases, frequently, although always with a resistance, mechanical or willed, either entirely ineffective or effective only to delay, or effective in one or two circumstances or, sometimes, wholly effective either to vary the act, eg to take to one tree instead of to another, or to prevent any tangible result. Ananda, resisted, is infrequent, without intensity & uncontinuous. Rupadrishti does not fulfil itself. In all these respects the resistance is strong & concentrated & even the trikaldrishti cannot act perfectly. Although there has been now five hours physical activity, there has been a frequent burden of fatigue in the legs due to defect of anima. Health is resisted in particular symptoms, with obstinacy of recurrence, but not with force; the asiddhi succeeds in materialising at these points & insisting for a short time, but has to retire. It is most obstinate in the process of digestive assimilation; for though it can no longer freely bring excess of vayu or frequent purisha visrishti (the last two intervals have been 3 1 – 2 days and now 2 days) it insists successfully on the excess of jala, a vague hint of nausea without real nausea, & a recurrence of the sign of excess. During the rest of the day there was a strong force of the ob- struction and no progress. The attempt at exact trikaldrishti of time failed entirely; the Power also failed signally to act several times and only succeeded at close quarters.

The premananda established yesterday with regard to persons & objects, was extended to events even the most adverse and thus establishes completely the positive samata, rasagrahanam, bhoga, ananda. Individual contradi ctions do not disturb the estab- lished force of samata. It is noticeable also that tamasic tyaga fails to establish itself and the pravritti persists in spite of continuous non-result or adverse result. The formula of tejo balam mahattvam pravrittih is fulfilled. At first the tejas was merely in the dhairya with occasional pravritti; then it extended itself to kshiprata & ugrata and established itself, today, in pravritti. Moreover, the sec- ond general formula of the shakti chatusthaya, adinata kshiprata sthairyam ishwarabhava is establishing itself and along with it the Chandibhava. But the continued successful resistance to the contin- uous action & progress of the powers prevents the ishwarabhava & kshiprata from perfecting themselves; for these depend on sar- vakarmasamarthya & sraddha swashaktyam. A working sraddha for the future is established, though the old questioning still lingers; but it is not a present & dominating faith in the immediate power or the early fulfilment. The action of the powers was reduced to their lowest limit all the morning; both continuity & generality were denied, only the crudest forms or isolated successes allowed & old imperfections attended the majority of the manifestations. The trikaldrishti has now, (3.45 pm), reestablished its activity, but the power still waits. Fatigue was thrown off in the morning, & 3 hours continuously then, 2 hours now were done, but some shadow of the fatigue hangs over the karmadeha & seizes sometimes on the nervous system & then on the muscular instrument. It was perceived, in the morn- ing, that all the contradictions of the physical siddhi, except the saundaryam, belong now to the karmadeha or, more often, to the personal environment, not to the body itself. From there they are reimposed on the body. 4.10 The Power is now working again, but not with invariability of impact or exactness of circumstance.

Various kinds of entirely perfect forms are appearing in the full focus of the eyes, but momentarily, without the least stability. Written Dec. 9. In the evening the Power & the rupadrishti regained their former activity & siddhi; no advance was made towards a fuller or wider perfection.. Sleep 7 1 – 2 hours. There was a still more perfect swapna samadhi; marred only by a slight admixture of false thought in the watching mind, but the record of the thing seen was without a flaw & delivered from that tendency to overhaste in travelling through the scenes witnessed which shows an unsteady movement of the Apas in the mind. Everything was deliberate & slow as in the actual living of the scene. This was in deep samadhi. There were a greater number of visions, dim chhayamaya, in light samadhi, not continuous, but [? ] in thought & subject. The actual dreams were at first perfectly free from present ego or suggestion of present associations, although the dream-images recurred faintly; but af- terwards they became touched with present image & thought- association. Three 1 – 2 hours more physical activity, continuous, & another 3 – 4 hour making over nine hours; the result the same. Dec. 9 th . The trikaldrishti is now working normally with a surprising regularity and perfection in immediate things; but the haste of in- tellectual decision & error of intellectual hesitation, the Scylla & Charybdis of prophetic thought, are not yet eliminated; they recur whenever the trikaldrishti has to be done, though absent when the trikaldrishti is merely happening. Parasaras Suktas are being interpreted by the vijnana, but not yet perfectly, as the modern associations of the words still interfere. Historical trikaldrishti of the past is active. 9 Both the trikaldrishti and the power (at first frustrated) have been acting for five or ten minutes in a host of instances with great & continual effectiveness. It is only now the minutiae that are wrong, & these are to be perfected; for sometimes 9 “Historical” was inserted after the sentence was completed; “of the past” was left uncancelled. Ed."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"26 November–31 December 1912 141 the minutiae also are for a long time absolutely accurate. The guidance also is at present perfect in every detail, although it is that of one of the Shaktis, & not the Purushottamas. There are three forms of the power, (1) one which works the object through the universal Prakriti, giving the suggestion to the Prakriti which transfers it to the swabhava of the object; (2) one which works the object by direct unspoken suggestion to the object, as in hypno- tism; (3) one which applies the force of Prakriti physically to the object and drives the unwilling object. All three are now active & frequently, even ordinarily successful; but all three still need time to work effectively on the object. If they do not get time, an effect or movement is produced, but not always or even usually the actual accomplishment or the full effect. During the rest of the day there was apparent suspension at- tended by loss of the Chandibhava, unreliability of the Vani and false suggestions through the outer swabhava. Health was also strongly attacked with great success in one detail and with tem- porary slight effect in others. The external suggestions are least effective at present in symptoms of phlegm & neuralgia which are obviously external, foreign to the system & unable to materialise in the sthula parts; they only affect the nerves with a suggestion of incipient cold or neuralgia. . The struggle over the visrishti still proceeds & the frequency of jalavisrishti maintains itself. However, the assimilation, although marred by excess of jala, seems to be more perfect with respect to prithivi, even though the maximum interval has been diminished from seven days to three or four. Sleep for nearly seven hours. The dream images were again mental images rather than actual figures; present associations af- fected the images and were comparatively ineffective on the thought except in one or two cases. Dec 10 t . h . In the morning there was an attack through the asraddha on the completed mukti, which produced an effect on the pranic atmosphere.

Perfection followed immediately by the above development & the partial emergence of B [Bijoy] from the whirlpool in the karmadeha in which he has been plunged since the first of December. The old defects of the trikaldrishti still recur and its limitations persist. The power is still more hampered & limited, even though its perfect action is frequent; but not on the body, nor in things belonging to the Karma. The rain in December, long foreseen, came this morning; but it was, as expected, only a passing spell of cloud and rain. The de- velopment in rupadrishti predicted by the Vani yesterday (without any statement of time, but supposed to be due last evening) came instead today. The trikaldrishti, power, knowledge, even special powers like bhasha, vyakarana etc are now progressing normally of themselves, without any sadhan or use of will-power for the purpose, the de- fects reoccurring, falling away, diminishing & thus passing out by a natural & quiet elimination, the way in which the first two chatusthayas have been or are being finally perfected. It is only the rupadrishti in the third chatusthaya that is still being pushed forward against an active resistance by the occasional use of the will-power. The real struggle has now passed to the fourth and fifth chatusthayas. Yesterday there were nine and a half hours of physical activity out of the twenty four, today there have been ten. It is now fixed that there can be the erect position & walking for ten hours every day"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"26 November–31 December 1912 143 without any binding reaction of fatigue. The fatigue that comes, is soon shaken off, as if alien to the body. It is noticeable that it is strongest after the nights sleep, diminishes as the day progresses & the physical activity increases and is least able to assert itself in the evening when it is taken three or [four hours] 10 at a time. The resis- tance, therefore, is still obstinate, but not powerful as it used to be. Sleep for over seven hours. The visions in samadhi grow in richness and completeness, eg last night a vision of armies of dif- ferent nationalities advancing successively along a road, not seen consecutively without interruption but successively with intervals of avikalpa samadhi. Dream is still in the same stage, but last night present associations interfered less than before in spite of the insistence of the present ego sense. Dream images were, however, frequent. Lipi is now being left to the Akash to hold in its perfection without any assistance from the Adhara except the assistance of intention. For this reason its manifestation is infrequent, not co- pious & often attended by difficulty & illegibility; but the lipi is in itself perfect, only the manifestation is obscured by the films in the akashic movement between the eyes & the object. Rupa is still delayed at the stage of unstable vividness in the perfect images, the resistance is not conquered. The first part of the programme given on the 3 d has been fulfilled under limitations which are apparent in this record. As regards the rest, there is undoubtedly occasional intensity, not of the highest kind, in the Ananda, and the less intense Kama Ananda is common, but the resistance to its regularised activity is still uncon- quered and the permanence is still farther from accomplishment.

The resistance is now to the fulfilment of the Adeshasiddhi, for if once a permanent power is manifested, in the control of the events immediately surrounding the adhara, all farther resistance will be convicted of inutility. This resistance, it is suggested, is now about to be overcome. The rupadrishti is to be brought on a level with the rest of the vijnanachatusthaya in this week, the bhautasiddhi liberated from the pressure of the defect of anima, the samadhi from the refusal of continuity in the visional record. Meanwhile the trikaldrishti & powers will expand rapidly in their action. The physical resistance to the Power in the body of self & others will yield, although it will from time to time recur until it is eliminated; as a result arogya, ananda & primary utthapana will be brought into line with the vijnanachatusthaya. Only saundarya in the physical siddhi will be left as a field of battle. The resistance to karma in the moulding of minds & the giving of experience & power will also break, & the resistance to the equipment. The rest will easily follow within these two months. 5. pm The rupadrishti has advanced today; perfect crude forms now sit easily in the akasha, perfect crude dense & crude developed forms appear frequently & with some stability; absolutely perfect forms are more frequent, but not yet stable.

Intellectual infallibility is now seen to be a possibility & not far from realisation, at least where it can be immediately tested. Kama Ananda today was continuous for some minutes, though not of the greater intensity already achieved. Sukshma sparsha is increasing in force & keenness, but is still usually only a subtle physical sensation, except in touches of water, fire or electric atoms which have now a great sthula reality & linger on the body both in the solid sensation & in its physical-nervous effects. Other touches do not yet materialise. Sukshma gandha & gandha-rasa with sparsha is keen & powerful, but irregular in occurrence. Sravana & drishti of actual forms & voices as opposed to images & symbolic sounds are still behindhand.

The difficulty that remains is only the difficulty of preventing the active & almost perfectly com- plete perception of possibilities, tendencies, intentions confusing the quite separate perception of the actual circumstance fixed in the foreknowledge of Virat & Prajna. The Shakti acts as before subject to delay & resistance. Lipi in the Akasha is still resisted in legibility except when it is aided by the subjective perception. In all other respects it is perfect. Rupadrishti, this morning has not been active, except in occasional images.

The pale chhayamaya images were extremely frequent & varied & those that were more vivid showed a greater tendency to combination and continuity. Ananda (kama) increased in force. In saundaryam there was retrogression (in the hair, tendency to entanglement, loss & dimin- ished softness). A nominal visrishti in the evening (after two days), but jala has again increased.

Both powers were at first of the nature of a physical pressure & compulsion on the objects, which struggled in vain to resist. In the first essays there was some momentary success in the resistance; a success which often supported itself on the first impulsion given against a new impulsion or reversion of the original command, but afterwards this success ceased and movement after movement was executed faithfully though unwillingly not only by individuals, but by numbers.. Afterwards there was a violent rush of enemies from outside the circle to oppose & break this success. In the struggle the old ashanti rose and many of the conditions established in the siddhi seemed to be broken & the mukti & bhukti seriously contradicted. The trouble did not pass away till after three in the afternoon. In the final result, the power has increased, but acts under a frequently successful resistance and the akash is still troubled & occupied by hostile forces. Todays experience has thrown a clear light on many expressions in the Veda especially in relation to Indra and the Rudras. There is a movement in the rupadrishti, perfect life- images, eg a butterfly, a squirrel, indistinguishable to the eye from the real object, dashing into the full sthula akasha or being glimpsed leaping through it; but there is, as yet, no stability. The normal manifestation of lipi is still successfully resisted. During the evening there was constant application of the at- tention to the lipi, but legibility only resulted with difficulty.

Trikaldrishti is attempting to arrange circum- stances perfectly in all cases, but does not yet command anything like a consistent success. The same is true of the Power, which sometimes enforces itself with great exactness of detail, sometimes not at all. The Vani is once more deficient in authority & creates false ideas in the mind, even though, so far as it goes, correct in the letter.

It is notable that the rupadrishti is developing without sadhan; perfect images grow steadily more frequent & have more hold on the akasha, the old imperfections tend to be eliminated, eg the persistent recurrence of a single image, in this case, the bird; other forms are now forcing their way into the akash without any help from the system. Lipi has recovered vividness without losing its tendency to activity. Trikaldrishti develops greatly & it is noticeable that it is best when entirely spontaneous, almost indeed of an absolute & consistent perfection, when, that is to say, there is no attempt in the system to determine the truth or arrive at the knowledge. Examples. The servant went out at 8.27. As he was going out, the knowledge came that someone was about to enter & would come in as soon as he was gone. R [Ramaswamy] came. Previously, there was vyapti that either S [Saurin] or N [Nolini] was returning. Now the knowledge came (in answer to a doubt whether the vyapti was not merely the vyapti of an intention) that he would come before 8.30. S came at 8.29. Subsequently, it was decided that 9.10 would be the exact moment to cease walking & have meals, & the knowledge came that M [Moni] would return at 9.10. N returned exactly at 9.10; exactly at 9.10 the meal was served (without any spoken order or mental suggestion) & the triple knowledge was fulfilled to the minute. In this way every little circumstance has to the time of writing proved exactly correct. This is, undoubtedly, the beginning of the consistent & invariable perfect drishti, but it is not to be supposed that it will establish itself even in this restricted sphere without farther opposition.

Also the proofs of it, when it comes from hundreds or thousands of miles away, are now coming in, eg. from M [Motilal] in Bengal that he intended to send more money, confirmed a few days afterward; the previous knowledge of the rumour that the Turks had asked to join the Balkan Confederacy, the knowledge of the Unionist conspiracy in Constantinople & a number of other instances relating to the Balkan war. This power, indeed, has been working for a long time, but it is only now regularised. It is, in fact, part of the vyapti. The proof of vyapti of express thoughts is also increasing in frequency; here, of course, the only proof is the expression of the thought immediately afterwards by the thinker. This now occurs.

Fatigue of adhogati, in the evening, was more persistent than usual, although not intense or powerful. Sleep, nearly seven hours.

Formerly both these anandas used to come as sahaituka or ahaituka touches; the negative resembled the feeling of rheumatism turned into a form of physical pleasure, the positive the feeling of internal heat similarly converted, but their electric nature was always patent to the sensations. It is, probably, these two forms of sukshma vidyut that are the basis of the phenomena of heat & cold such at least is the theory suggested to me in Alipur jail. The trikaldrishti continues successfully, but the (involuntary) attempt to fix the truth brings the tendency to substitute a percep- tion of force or tendency for a perception of result; nevertheless this error seems, now, to be usually corrected before it can seize on the mind. These remnants of false energy (anrita tejas) have to be entirely rooted out of the mental action. Sensitiveness to cold after having been almost entirely ex- truded, except in the lowered night vitality between sleep & sleep, is now again attacking the system. 4pm. There is a pause in the siddhi today, a relaxation and resting; yet certain movements are being decided. The one defect in the subjective Ananda, the absence of a certain & victorious Ananda in asiddhi and amangalam is being finally remedied, the force of the sadhan is being turned on the physical siddhi & the final perfection of the dasyam is being prepared. So far only five hours and a half have been given to the primary utthapana. The purely parthiva insistence of the Apana has been strong throughout the afternoon. It seems that both these physical siddhis have to be relaxed today.

The afternoon has passed under Vritra, the power slow to act, the trikaldrishti & jnana uncertain, the physical brain dull and overcast. The Maheshwari-Mahasaraswati shanti is giving place under such circumstances to the Mahasaraswati-Mahakali quietude based on a concealed Maheshwari pratistha. Nirukta is now acting under the rule of the vijnana normally & bhasha begins to follow suit; the intellect in the environment has recognised the necessity of passivity & the superior results of the vijnanamaya method. The frequency of Ananda (Kama) continues but is interrupted by Vritric periods. The trikaldrishti has now (4.55) recovered possession and is acting with a considerable perfection in all its movements & entire perfection (except of right combination) in some of them ie a movement or incident is seen in pieces of knowledge each of which would lead to an incorrect conclusion by itself, but taken together give a perfectly correct result. Their separate advent shows want of spontaneous combination in the knowledge; there is only col- location ending in combination. Power is still ineffective, except occasionally. Physical activity, 5.5 to 11.30 with an interval of 25 minutes for meal; altogether over 13 hours. There was no fatigue during this period.

The vague stiffness does not entirely disappear, but is ineffective. The dasya and personal relation of the Master increase. The substitute for religious piety has been established in the consciousness, viz the knowledge of the Para Purusha, the sense of the power of the Ishwara & submission to it attended with the appropriate bhava in the chitta & the personal relation to the Lover. ([Written] Dec 18) Immediately after writing the above, the trikaldrishti again became active for a time, but was clouded later on. At the same time the interpretation of lipi & rupa was re-manifested in perfection; but there was a renewed cloud of confusion over the immaterial drishti. Physical activity, resumed at 5.15 was continued till 12.15 with an interval of 25 minutes for meals. Today therefore gave a total of 16 hours out of 18. Fatigue only dominated the system once in the day, on the occasion already recorded. Sleep for 5 1 – 2 hours. Yesterday, in the samadhi, the old movement of a conscious exit of the mental being from the material centre (not a complete exit, not trance, but the usual swapnamaya departure) was resumed. It has this defect still that too strong a trend of the consciousness towards the body remains, so that the purusha is easily drawn back to the body, leaving only his linga sharira in the place of dream experience.

This defect of anima in the mere annam continues, but has no real effect, because the pranakosha & the physical nervous system liberates itself more & more from the mere physical experiences & accepts more & more the law of the sukshma deha. Kamananda, though strongly attacked, continues in spite of long interruptions and these two siddhis (K.

On the other hand, the arogya is still engaged in the struggle to expel its minor contradictions & the saundaryam, although one more striking sign has been given of willed modification of form, continues to be feeble & uncertain in its inchoate manifestations. Trikaldrishti has been clouded throughout the morning; active in the afternoon, perfect in detail, but not very active. Power is for the most part denied. A great dullness reigns over the physical brain and the karmadeha, in the midst of which samata & dasya become always stronger & now tejas & tapas are beginning to establish their indifference to adverse result. They are seeking, that is to say, to be no longer deterred from action either by failure or even asraddha.

It is now evident also that the knowledge was still acting on the levels of potentiality, where the thing arranged can be disturbed, because it is the arrangement of the Manishi, not the Kavi. It was, however, one of the higher levels on which the Manishi is strong in will, clearsighted in perception, but not able to embrace enough in his view (mahan, urushansa).

This movement has already begun. The first is a necessary part of it, viz the firm & unstumbling activity of the higher Pravritti & Ananda on a plane above that of mind, even of pure mind. Srikrishna standing on that level is giving this activity. The sukshmadrishti has for the last two days been progressing. The gandhadrishti, which was always more pronounced than the others, has now overcome its two limitations, restriction of range to the smells most common in the immediate material experience and reliance on the material adhar; it is now admitting perfumes & other scents not within the physical range or usual experience.

Sparsha is still confined to the habitual touches, rain, wind, insects, heat of the sukshma sun, fire, etc & the result rather than the actuality of certain subtle touches. In samadhi however sparsha is very vivid & the physical sensation remains after waking. The more developed touches (human) are only felt in the waking state through the subtle nervous system, but they are there often acute. Such touches as reach the sthula body without this veil increase in frequency & intensity. Finally, shabda is now beginning to disengage itself finally from the adhara. This sense which was the most acute & earliest to develop, is now the latest (rupa excepted) to perfect itself & the clear sounds of the jail do not repeat themselves. Finally, rupa is still confined to mere image, pratimurti, & does not give the murti or actual form of which there were some instances in the jail & afterwards, but none here. The health is still attacked. Last night there was a violent and unprecedentedly obstinate attack of the pain in the breast which used sometimes to occur when there was suppressed indigestion, but this time it was seen to come from outside & to be forced on the body. Intolerable at first, it was finally attacked and partly possessed by the ananda. It persisted in a dull form throughout the day, but was mostly cast out by the Will in the evening.. An attempt was also made to revive the ailments of cold & a crude appearance of ten- dency to phlegm in the nose was for some minutes materialised. All these, however, were failures and only at the centre & in the stom- ach was any real effect produced; in the latter, moreover, it was for- eign and not native to the system. A very slight visrishti allowed for nominal relief at 8.30 pm. The twelve hours limit was maintained. Sleep 6 hours; but its attack was more oppressive than it should be. Dec 21.

It was a statement of tendency which came erroneously as a prediction. At present the tapas, & tejas, is being driven forward without much regard to the state of the adhara or the stumbles of the knowledge. Formerly, when the tapas became active, false tejas & tapas took possession of it and there had to be a return to nivritti, but now the intermixture of false tejas is not allowed to stop the pravritti, because, as it seems, this false tejas is not able to take possession. True tejas & prakasha are now in possession & the false is only an invading power which sometimes establishes a precarious foothold or which still occupies partially a part of the ground here & there. The siddhi of the second & third chatusthaya[s] (shakti & vijnana) is following therefore, but much more rapidly, the same process & line of development as the first. There was first the war to oust the enemy in possession, the calling in of the aid [ ] 13 of doubtful friends & natural enemies, the carrying & loss of positions, the con- fused fighting, the slow & precarious progress; then the ill-assured possession, becoming more & more assured, then the possession subject to revolts & revolutions, then the entire possession subject to invasions by the ousted enemy, finally a complete possession with occasional vibrations of the memory of old troubles. In the case of the shanti & samata, the struggle has taken many years & gone through various stages, of which the last alone answers entirely to the above description. The other two were never regularly fought out, except in certain points, before the arrival at Pondicherry. Their final progress, owing to the victory of the samata, is proving much more easy and rapid. Later in the day, a sudden revolt of impatience & unfaith, not grief or even actual anger, against the continual running after possibilities in the prana & trikaldrishti and a violent rejection of the resulting false trikaldrishti.

([Written] Dec 26.) During the rest of the day there was a struggle between the new system and the dregs of the old. The lipi became permanently active, but the old difficulty of manifesta- tion or emergence in the sthula akasha is not yet overcome. At the same time interpreting power attending the lipi became swift and decisive and has so remained. Trikaldrishti in all its parts resumed its activity. The most important result is the final completion of the dasya & the disappearance of all que stioning, revolts or self-action; for, whenever these try to manifest, they find no support in the Jiva. Even with regard to error, there is no revolt nor now any return to a tamasic udasinata. The siddhi now fulfils itself entirely by the divine action arranging the conflicting forces & the Jiva does not try to interfere or insist on a consistent method. By this the invading intellectual activity has become wholly discouraged and no longer insists on its own action. There is, however, a survival of manomaya suggestions representing themselves as vani & seeking to lay down the action, but as these are always falsified & the Jiva does not insist on them, they have no force of persistence. Health is undergoing a very serious assault. The sore-throat was flung off, but after a long struggle cough materialised for a very short time at night, & strenuous efforts are made to bring back cold. Tejasic disturbance in the stomach has returned & recurs, though it does not persist against the Will, & there was in the morning a copious visrishti quite of the old type. This is the result of copious eating & drinking without regard to satiety, which has been insisted on in order that [ ] 16 the arogya may be established under more arduous conditions. Assimilation is powerful, but not enough to prevent a struggle & irregular workings of the asiddhi.

As usual, the sortileges began at once to be fulfilled. The force described has established itself in the siddhi; effort, no longer self- effort, manifests itself as a force throwing itself on the enemy & breaking down all opposition. This struggle is the working of men- tal force (Indra) possessed by the Vijnana and filled with mental ananda (Soma). Whenever Indra is thus infused with Soma, op- position seems to disappear; it is only when Indra works without Soma, that the opposition has strength to prevail or at least to resist. Once more Soma is being felt physically in the sensation as of wine flowing through the system, but in the sukshma rather than in the sthula body. Trikaldrishti has been working with a consistent perfection, & aishwarya, at first entirely resisted, broke down opposition & is still busy with the struggle. Throughout the whole siddhi, a state of joyous battle & assured victory is replacing the old alternation between the joy of attainment & the pain of struggle & defeat. 6 continuous hours of primary utthapana from 6.15 to 12.13 and again from 12.35 to 1.35. It was only towards the end that there was some reaction. The replacement of intellect by vijnana continues. Rupa is still developing, stable developed forms are more per- fect, & the perfect transient forms show a greater tendency to stability. Primary utthapana again from 4.20 to 10.15 with the half- hour interval for meal. Today secondary utthapana was resumed, the laghima being perfect, but limited in duration by defect of anima.

The aishwarya-vyapti has had effects on purifying considerably the mentality of all in the house, & in the increase & definite development of trikaldrishti in S [Saurin], but his knowledge is still only fragmentarily active. The successful application of the power in immediate result is still successfully resisted except in individual cases; but yesterday groups of existences were made to obey the Will and even to obey it in exact circumstance. The attack on the health seems to be lessening in force; but last night the cough, which is however entirely superficial, returned with some vehemence after a hot sukshma touch on the sensitive spot in the throat. Kamananda is still in the same condition, but the sahaituka shariranandas seem to be once more at a high intensity. The confused action of the intellect revived in some force and although the siddhis continued, certainty was for a time abrogated. The improvement in the Viceroys health took place in the direction willed, viz elimination of fever & pain. A period must now be fixed for entire recovery & it must be seen whether the element of time can be controlled. The Turkish business is also centring round the point willed, but the upshot is still in doubt. The cough tried to cling throughout the day, but disappeared by the evening, contrary to its action yesterday. Roga in its other symptoms clings, but cannot assert itself. Will acted with great accuracy in the matter of the returns in the evening, but the trikaldrishti was confused in details. Another failure as regards equipment. The failure was seen before it was known, by vyapti, but there was an attempt to mislead by false vyaptis. Sleep over 7 1 – 2 hours.

Sleep 7 hours. Dec. 30th There is no farther need of a record such as has been kept during this month. There has been considerable progress, but upon lines which have now to be altered and soon to be abandoned. The programme proposed on the 3 d December has as usual been fulfilled only in its beginnings & in one or two instances not at all. The stability of rupadrishti is of little value in itself, since the perfect forms do not hold the akasha, & has been accomplished only in the sense that the forms accomplished appear habitually & the progress made has not to be continually lost & built up again, as used to be the case. Lipi is not yet habitually spontaneous in legibility & still needs usually the stimulus of the subjective perception to become perfectly legible, but it appears more usually without particular demand, though less frequently without any warning or the turning of the attention in that direction. It will only be perfect when it ap- pears uncalled for as an ordinary habit of the akasha and is always immediately legible without any attention or trouble to the mind. Trikaldrishti works perfectly often, but not always, nor even yet as a rule, except in single incidents which present themselves to the mind, but where the perception is active rather than passive, there is usually much uncertainty & confusion of details. Nevertheless the more or less perfect trikaldrishti does occur daily with some frequency & in an imperfect state it is working throughout the day. The Power has so far overcome resistance as to work habitually like the Trikaldrishti, but it is even more hampered & outside a narrow field imperfectly, slowly or irregularly effective. Samadhi has not been regularised. Ananda (kama) is occasionally intense on a moderate estimate of intensity.

It occurs, tivra or kuntha, daily & often frequently in the day and is in that sense permanent. But it is not continuous in its permanence or constant in its intensity. Health in the last half of the month has been successfully resisted, rather than successfully pro- gressive; cough, which had disappeared, has reappeared; the other fragments of roga, however vague, slight, blunted or disjointed, still persist & even when they seem to have finally disappeared, unexpectedly return. Nevertheless, they are losing force; but that is all that can be said. The saundarya has not progressed since the 10 th , materially; its successes are the merest beginnings & in most directions the opposite tendency prevails. Primary utthapana has so far established itself that ten to twelve hours daily are passed, walk- ing or standing, without any permanent reaction except a vague defect of anima which sometimes tends to materialise feebly and a moderate adhogati, also vague & dull, in the earlier part of the day. The prediction about equipment has been entirely falsified & the acuteness of the position has not been lightened. The literary & scholastic work has begun to take shape & proceed or prepare to proceed on its proper lines, but the necessary materials are deficient. The religious work is now being founded on a certain power over the sadhana of others, but this is as yet only rudimentary. The same is true of other activities. There is an effective pressure of power, but not the sovran control that is needed. The contact with the Master of the Yoga is being constantly dulled & obscured by the siege of Ego in the environment, false suggestion & inferior vani. Realisation of Atman & Brahman Nirguna & Saguna is always available & at once returns in fullness when the mind turns in that direction, but the nitya smarana is not there, because, perhaps, the realisation of the Ishwara is not equally well-established. The whole Yoga is still subject to clouding & temporary breaches even of those siddhis that have been most perfectly accomplished. Although these breaches are often slight, temporary & without power yet their re- currence shows that the whole system has not been placed perfectly under the right control.

The first motion seen in the squirrels mind (prakamya) before it is executed, the second d[itt]o, the third by trikaldrishti without any data objective or subjective. 2. The leaflike insect put yesterday on the smaller tree stated yesterday by S [Saurin] to be no longer on the tree, suggested that it was back among the bean-leaves. While searching for it with the eyes today, trikaldrishti that it was not in the bean plant & was, probably, still on the tree. No data. The certainty was absent. Half an hour later it was shown by N [Nolini] still on the tree. 3. A crow approaching the veranda another upon it. The idea of coming on the verandah seen in the crows mind, but a suggestion of trikaldrishti that it would fly away to the wall on the left before reaching it. Uncertainty & false viveka mistaking the intention for the event. Suggestion at the last moment when the crow had paused just below the veranda to eat something, that something would happen to send it away rejected obstinately by false viveka. The next moment the first crow flew away to the wall on the left & the object of observation followed it. These three instances show the state of the trikaldrishti. Every- thing observed is the rendering in thought of a truth of tendency, intention, or event, but everything is not yet put easily in its correct place, & uncertainty about the actual event is the normal state of the mental being who cannot distinguish between the correct decision and a false choice.. This stage has to be exceeded, before a clear & reliable trikaldrishti can be established. Physical activity 10 hours. Sleep 6. Slight visrishti in the after- noon. Jala very copious & frequent.

Yesterdays lipis indicated that tyaga (outward) must be entirely abandoned and bhoga fully accepted; “submission to desirability” or some equivalent phrase was used. Another lipi ran “violent purposes have to be justified” & is interpreted in the sense that, although hitherto all the more vehement uses of the aishwarya have been abortive and only moderate demands have been satisfied, the vehe- ment Mahakali use of the aishwarya and ishita have not therefore to be abandoned, but must be insisted on till they succeed. Aniruddha and his Shakti Mahasaraswati have been satisfied; the Yogasiddhi has been justified & the Adeshasiddhi is beginning to be justified by slow, small and steadily progressive processes. This is Anirud- dhas method, the method of the patient intellectual seeker & the patient and laborious contriver who occupies knowledge & action inch by inch & step by step, covering minutely & progressively all the grounds, justifying himself by details and through the details arriving at the sum. But, if continued, this method would render success in this life impossible. The method chosen for preparation has been Mahasaraswatis, but the method chosen for fulfilment is Mahakalis in the Mahasaraswati mould. Mahakalis method is vehemence, force & swiftness, attaining knowledge by swift intu- itions, moving to success in action by forceful strides. It is vehement in lipsa, violent in method, headlong in accomplishment. It seeks to attain the whole & then only returns upon the details. This vehemence, violence & precipitate rapidity has to be established in the prana, chitta and buddhi, so as to govern feeling, thought & action (there have been plenty of isolated instances & brief periods of it in the past of the sadhana) and justified by success; but the basis of hidden calm & self-possession in the Maheshwari-bhava of Mahasaraswati has to be maintained and all has to be in the [Mahasaraswati] 17 mould which demands thoroughness, perfect [contrivance], 18 faultless elaboration of detail in the consummate 17 MS Maheshwari 18 MS contrive"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"26 November–31 December 1912 171 whole. The literary work, the subjective action on others, the out- ward physical speech and action have all to be done with this swift elaboration & violent minuteness. At first, the Maheshwari bhava will retain some prominence, but w ill afterwards become implicit only in its Mahasaraswati continent. The first necessity is, however, that the Mahakali method should be justified in the results so that the intellectual sceptic & critic in Mahasaraswati may be assured of the correctness of the instructions given. Bhasha. Bhs [Bharatis] Panchali Sapatham taken up; in the first verse yesterday only a few words could be understood without reference to the dictionary & no connected sense has been made out from the sum of the vocable. Today, in the second verse, the difficulties of the Tamil way of writing (sandhi etc) were overcome by the intuition as well as some of the difficulties of the gram- mar, but the Bhashashakti which used formerly to give correctly the meaning of unknown words has not recovered its habit of action. Trikaldrishti. This morning all the trikaldrishtis were correct, even when coupled in their action with aishwarya sometimes successful, sometimes unsuccessful. Formerly the aishwarya would represent itself as trikaldrishti, but this false action this morning occurred only three or four times & was immediately rejected; but in one or two cases the rejection was questioned for a while by false tejas. Aishwarya mixed with trikaldrishti On a bird alighting on a tree to move from one part of a branch to another & then from that branch to a neighbouring branch; carried out exactly; then to remain sitting where it was.

Also that two birds on another tree, making love, would so continue till the same moment. This was fulfilled exactly, although it was nearly ten minutes before I went away & the same birds had previously been restless, flown away once out of sight & come back, all foreseen by the drishti, except the return.

Last night there was some swapna samadhi, but only one image survives in the memory, a room or tent with a small table such as might be used in a tent & a sola hat on the table, seen for some time, but with a momentary eclipse after which it emerged again & then vanished, a scene without any incident or moving figure, although it was felt that there would have been either movement or incident, if the power of vision had been able to hold the scene.

Sleep nearly 7 hours. Swapna samadhi with images indistinguishable to the eye from dream images, distinguishable by the viveka alone. The faculty of understanding the truth behind the dream record and disentangling its confusions has once more returned. Fresh proofs of the siddhis constantly occur, but there are plenty of instances of misplaced perception and the siddhis of power have as yet no assured mastery over results. Primary utthapana continues in the same condition; it cannot be perfected unless the secondary & tertiary are brought forward. This day closes the year 1912. From its morrow a new record begins in which the progress of the siddhi of Mahakali- Mahasaraswati has to be recorded. At present there is no sign of any rapid progress or of really great results. All is petty, hampered & limited. A siddhi rapidly established becomes otiose for days together. Continuity in the higher states seems as yet impossible, and from accomplishment there is always a relapse into a condition of partial asiddhi. The whole Yoga is continually beset with tamas and uncertainty & seems unable to rise permanently into clearness & perfect joy & assurance. There is no grief or acute trouble or even anything that can really be called trouble, but a dull depression never acute & a certain weariness & lack of interest has settled down on the system and is only lifted for short intervals or replaced by a mere ahaituka state of ambitionless content. The active force, ananda etc established for a short period, have failed to hold their own. The tejasic ideas of a joyous progress & of siddhi within a given time have once more proved to be falsehoods. On the other hand the theory of the Yoga has been proved. The perfectibility of the human being, trikaldrishti, Power, the play of the Divine Force in the individual, the existence of the other worlds, & of extra-mental influences, even the possibility of the physical siddhis are established facts vijnana, the Vedic psychology, the seven streams, everything is established.

By the fulfilment or failure of this harmony the Yoga stands or falls. The siddhi has now reached a stage when the test of its positive worldward side has to be undertaken. Tyaga is finished; shama & shanti & udasinata have had their fulfilment; but in that resting place there can be no abiding. It is the starting point of the Lila, not its goal. Therefore during the next three months it has to be seen whether, the harmony in nivritti being definitely thrown aside, the harmony in pravritti, which has always been attacked & denied by the enemy, can be prepared or accomplished.

The promise has been made that there will be no farther in- terruption in the continuity of the siddhi. Since then (last night), considerable progress is being made. Trikaldrishti. . In the beginning there was a series of outward suggestions which fulfilled themselves rapidly & accurately, al- though the mind denied them admission and saw no probability of fulfilment. Subsequently, this element of external suggestion was put in its place as prophetic vyapti from the thought of supra- material beings that foresee; the jnanam was then perfected and afterwards the trikaldrishti in its entirety brought up to the level of the same perfection. The difference between this new siddhi and all that have preceded it is, 1, that the first idea proves to be correct and has not to be replaced by a second, at most it has to be amplified and modified or enriched with suggestions of the right time and place & arrangement, 2, that even when it manifests in the intellect without being seen to descend from the vijnana, it is habitually correct, 3, that mistaken suggestion[s], except in small details of time, place & circumstance, tend to be more & more rare and already form the infrequent exception. In the thought-perception there is no falsity, but only appearances of it which turn out to be not falsity but aprakasha. News today that yesterday (the 31 st ) the Viceroy was for the first time entirely without pain from his wounds, (the result of the last extraction). Thus the first aishwarya & drishti has been amply fulfilled. A rapid cure of the wounds must now be effected. Trikaldrishti of the more distant future and of the far past is now taking place unhindered; it remains for the future siddhi to control its results whether for confirmation or rejection. In its application to the immediate future and the present it is evincing an astonishing accuracy.

Dasya is becoming absolute in the thought and feeling no less than in the action; doubt extends only to the adesh-siddhi and has, even in this field, only a dull activity of reserve and caveat; for it is growing evident that something will be done through this yantra in the field of life, although the material equipment seems to be entirely lacking. It is this lack of material equipment which is the real obstacle to perfect faith; the slowness of the physical siddhi is only an accessory cause of hesitation and would have no force if the equipment were given. These movements have still to be occasionally noted, so that the condition of the activity which is to form the substance of the record may be understood. 4pm. Aishwaryasiddhi promised; the first result was the fulfilment of the aishwarya made at 1.30 that M [Moni] should come to make the tea about 3.10 by the time of my watch. He came at 3.11. This is a rare instance, almost the first that is entirely clear and definite, of an aishwarya of exact time being perfectly fulfilled, although trikaldrishtis of exact time have been not infrequent. Usu- ally indeed, such aishwaryas have not even been attempted, only aishwaryas of approximate time, eg between 9 & 9.30. This success was followed by a series upon birds which one after another flew in the direction indicated to them, although they obviously started in a different direction.

The physical obstacle to continuous karma is overcome as well as the subjective obstacle, failure of physical dhairya as well as failure of mental tejas. Mental dhairya, physical dhairya & pranic tejas assured, mental tejas has to be ren- dered equally permanent and invincibly active so that the physical brain may not flag in its response to the stimulus from above. The quaternary, Tejo balam pravrittir mahattwam, will then be assured in all the parts of the system. Vijnana is now beginning to assert its constant activity, pausing only to test the state of the intellect; for when the intellect, even in its darkened or clouded state, refuses to rest in error and begins to respond only to the satya, then the pratistha in intellect of the vijnanamaya action will be assured. At present, it is so assured in all but the trikaldrishti, the action of mind on the objective field, & this is so because the trikaldrishti itself is still limited in its ordinary action, though already perfect in its best moments & in its extraordinary movements. It has been decided yesterday that the development of the Knowledge must be left to the unaided action of the Prakriti, the Power to its own self-"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 181 development and the Samadhi, physical siddhi and Karma alone left for the present field of the stimulative action of the Will aiding Prakriti. Trikaldrishti has to be liberated from the dregs of possibility; lipi from the remnants of the obstruction in the akasha; rupa from the denial of stability in the higher forms; prakamya-vyapti from the interference of elemental thought-images; samadhi from sleep & dream; power from the akashic obstruction to subjective recep- tion and objective fulfilment; bhautasiddhi from defect of anima; primary utthapana from adhogati and the remnants of defect of anima; ananda from interruption and the obstruction by weaker nerve-elementals influencing the body; arogya from the habit of symptomatic recurrences. This field is almost conquered, subject to the last obstinate resistance. Secondary utthapana of the neck, loins & legs was resumed this morning. It is growing stronger in the first, almost nil in the second, absent in the third. The Unionist dissensions & the movement of the Ulster affair are now patently following the line of the aishwarya persisted in since the introduction of the Home Rule Bill & in the Insurance matter there is a perfect success. The relapse of the 1 st in the Vs health has had the consequences foreseen, but there may still be a rapid cure, if there is no farther premature exertion. It is suggested that his health will never be what it was formerly. The Power is reasserting efficacy but with difficulty. Trikaldrishti is now establishing itself on a wider basis: for- merly it acted in isolated movements of knowledge on a basis either of error, of uncertainty or of passivity in the intellectual movements. It has now got rid of the third basis (nischeshtata of the mind), so important and so long sustained as a necessary movement of sadhana; admitting action, it allows the intellect to take in all that comes within its field and detecting its own misapplications to per- ceive the nature of the error, the actual truth misapplied and replace the former by the latter. At the same time, the separation of Power & Knowledge is being removed; they are acting simultaneously & the old form of error which took the will for the event, is being allowed play in order that it may be expelled by the viveka serving"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"182 Record of Yoga the trikaldrishti & deciding the correct event among the various tendencies, applied forces & possibilities. The formed, articulate or vangmaya thought assumed sud- denly its perfect and fluent activity in the evening; it has already all the qualities of perfection which, at an earlier stage of the siddhi, it was preparing, except that it has not a sure hold of its proper locality & sometimes, ie when it deals with matter not formerly included in the scope of the vangmaya thinking, descends from the higher style proper to it into the lower inefficient vak; at such times it tends to pass back from thought into inferior vani. The watch being out of order, it was impossible to estimate periods. Dreams were much more coherent, although there is still the tendency to mixture of incidents & false forms due to the ap- pearance of the present ego with its associations. Swapnasamadhi was stronger and dream images tend to pass into clear and living chhayamaya forms. Jan 6 t . h . The morning there was a rapid movement forward in knowl- edge. The progress of the trikaldrishti is tending to eliminate the sources of intellectual error and the thought perception and vang- maya thought between them are taking charge of all trikaldrishti not appertaining to this immediate existence or in this life to the progress of the siddhi. Perception of past & future lives of others is reestablished. All these perceptions are necessarily beyond im- mediate verification; the action of the vijnana is swayamprakasha. Their intellectual justification rests upon the ample daily proof of the soundness of the supra-intellectual faculty by which they are received, and the only remaining cause of doubt is the remnant of intellectual activity (external) and therefore of error which in- terferes with the vijnana-perception. Vani, conducted by one of the Shaktis, has asserted its authority and is proving its veridicity. Lipi is preparing the final proof of its truthfulness. The faith in the vani, thought & trikaldrishti is now ample except in the one field unconquered.

The other lipi “death of the difficulties”, has already begun to be fulfilled in the siddhi of the knowledge. There is a tendency in the rupa to develop groups and paintings with their colours, but the obstruction in the akasha maintains itself & prevents the efflorescence of the rupadrishti which is waiting, perfect and richly-equipped, in the sukshma akasha for its hour of manifestation. The images of the swapna samadhi were once more of the richer & brighter kind, but the dreams were more incoherent and ill-remembered. Kamananda is more persistent in recurrence, but has not yet established continuity. The other parts of the physical siddhi are heavily obstructed and do not move forward; to a less extent the power; only knowledge, trikaldrishti and lipi are moving forward irresistibly. Jan 7 th . It is indicated that today is a turning-point in the immediate movement that is being slowly effected. Dasya is already a fact in all parts of the activity, but it is not yet direct enough; the control through the Prakriti is felt rather than the direct impulse of the Purushottama. There must be identification with the Prakriti, pos- session of it and the sensation of its unimpeded use by the actual touch of Krishna. The shadow of intellectual consideration and hesitation over the act or the thought, the shadow of intellectual determination of the act or thought, the shadow of reflection & judgment over it when accomplished, or of the accompaniment or mediation of the intellect in the moment of accomplishment, all these glints of the lower humanity must be effaced from the move- ment of the Waters, apasi swasr ́ in ́ am. They must be utterly replaced by unchecked Force in the act and pure Sight in the vision, Sight & Force simultaneous in their activity and one in their substance, but not intermixed in their function. Then only will the Dasya be of the true nature of the relation between the Jiva & the Ishwara. The condition of the Viceroy answers to the trikaldrishti and aishwarya, in the circumstances of a rapid improvement. The Turk- ish affair is still uncertain but in several directions it is following the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"184 Record of Yoga line laid down by the Will. In several directions, in Indian affairs, similar signs are evident; but as yet there is nothing decided. The only work done in the day was a grammatical commentary on the fifth hymn of the Rigveda. Here as in all the works of Knowl- edge, there is a double stream of action, the intuition which sees the truth and the speculative reason with its groping judgments, imag- inations, memories, inferences which works towards truth through error. The script was once more resumed; its first movement was of the old type, perfunctory, hasty & exaggerated in suggestion, although not actually false in statement; its second, accurate in statement and suggestion, but marred by the tejasic response of the mind reading more into the words than the words themselves conveyed. The trikaldrishti, perfect in the earlier part of the day, became a confused and stumbling movement at night. Lipi increases in force constantly, but slowly. In the body the adverse tendency still reigns, and although the aishwarya often acts, it is successful with difficulty & in details unsuccessful. Sleep is still excessive, but the dreams were of a remarkable character; they had for their subject world-spaces and primal movements of the gods. There was a slight admixture of present associations, but not of present ego except as the watcher. The whole took place in Chhayamayi. The day proved to be a turning-point in the dasya chiefly, not that the necessary change has been effected, but that it has been begun; but otherwise the indication has not been justified. Jan 8 t . h . The script is now showing a remarkable accuracy of prediction which it shares with the vani. Two of its predictions made this morn- ing for the day have already been fulfilled; “The trikaldrishti today will throw off the doubt and judgment, but not yet the uncertainty left behind by them in the action of the faculty on the intellect,” and “Lipi will justify the prediction.” It had been predicted three days ago in the script that lipi today would perfect itself in the material akasha. This has now been fulfilled. The great remaining defects of the lipi were insufficient spontaneity and an uncertain vividness; it depended for emergence too much on the subjective stimulus & obeyed too much the intellectual suggestion. This difficulty has been"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 185 finally surmounted & even when the external mind suggests a word or form of words, the lipi pays no heed, but shapes its own word or sentence. All the other qualities needed, legibility, simultaneity, etc are now coexistent with the spontaneity, (formerly, one quality used to perfect itself at the expense of another,) and vividness though not invariable is now well established in the legible, spontaneous and simultaneous lipi. The legible simultaneity is not usually immediate, it is ordinarily the result of a consecutive appearance of the words; when the whole sentence starts at once into view, it is not always or usually legible. These slight deficiencies are not essential defects, but they have to be dismissed out of the siddhi & the perfection attained preserved and enriched by variety of the lipi-kaushalya. In trikaldrishti intellectual judgment & doubt have received their dismissal & the mind merely waits to see the result. In consequence, it is found that everything that enters the mind, is correct, although [] 1 not always perfectly placed, & that it is the doubt & im- patience of the intellect which is the source of error; for it cannot wait to see the suggestion placed & justified, but either catches at & overstresses it or rejects it by a premature haste of adverse judgment. (Afternoon) Trikaldrishti. Pressure of Turkish Army for a change of ministry & command foreseen & fulfilled. Movements to put Shaukat (& Anwar) in com- mand twice foreseen or felt by vyapti-prakamya & twice fulfilled . . Foreseen day before yesterday at night that money would come within two days from R. Fulfilled today, but only Rs 10 came (no data). The aishwarya is recovering its full force in many instances & has again begun to be fulfilled in detail & repeatedly, but the opposition is still to some extent master of the sthula akasha. The prediction in script is that today Rupa will at last emerge & Power overcome, for the last time, the general obstruction. There was some emergence of Rupa in the morning, but it did not last, nor did it effect the stability of perfect forms. Every time the opposition in the akasha throws itself on the forward movement & seems to 1 MS though"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"186 Record of Yoga overbear it. At the same time there is a sensible movement of the Para Tapas to throw off the general obstruction and pursue steadily and powerfully the totality of the siddhi. Nirukta has been resumed today and is being well, but slowly done. Rupa emerged in the afternoon and evening, not perfect, but with greater force than before, so that perfect forms more frequently come out into the sthula akasha and meet the physical eye direct instead of manifesting as formerly mostly in the sukshma akasha or, if in the sthula, then avoiding the gaze and affecting the physical eye through the subtle vision. Still the indirect method and the subtle field continue to be the most common. Crude shapes alone meet the eye full and these are now more usually stable and perfect. Lipi continues to increase on the akash. Power has begun to overcome the general obstruction, but its victory is as yet neither decisive nor assured. There was a great extension of swapna-samadhi at night & especially in the early morning, images of great frequency & perfection occurring & brief continuous scenes frequently mani- festing with something, often, of their background. This is the one real difficulty in the swapna-samadhi, the continuous action in a fixed scene. Otherwise the swapna (not dream, but vision-record) is perfect enough & combined touch, hearing & sight are well enough established, though they do not come as a regular circumstance of the siddhi in its present working. The only prediction in script that seemed to be beside the mark was the statement that Ananda this day would again take hold, but even this was true if it is understood of the subjective Ananda and not the Kamananda. Jan 9 t . h . . Another slight clash seems to be passing away. Todays tele- grams all show the exact working of the Will except with regard to Adrianople, which is the one serious point of attack. Especially the action of the Powers, the situation at Constantinople and the opinion of the Triple Alliance with regard to the Aegean islands are in exact consonance with the line laid down by Will & prakamya vyapti. Today, the action of the vijnana is very much confused owing to the necessity of harmonising finally tejas & tapas with prakasha & dasya in the intellect. Always, the intellect & manas have been"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 187 the field of their discord and incompatibility, & though they now agree well enough in the higher ideal or idealised movements (vi- jnanamaya or vijnana yantrita), the manomaya movements which besiege the system from the external kshetra are still full of the old confusion. Yet the lipi has insisted on today as a period of rapid progression. Up till now, this does not appear. Afternoon. The siddhi of the visrishti & freedom from satiety long com- bated and diminished has momentarily collapsed. Kamananda, although its activity has not disappeared, has at present no hold on the body. The physical siddhi persists in its retrograde mo- tion. The external tapas is now falling away again from the system and is giving place to tapas under control of the dasya- buddhi . . The samadhi has suddenly & without farther difficulty acquired siddhi in the vijnana & saviveka samadhi, corresponding to the savichara and savitarka of the intellectual classification. The thought, whether as perception or vangmaya, maintains itself on the vijnanamay level, the intellect in a state of perfect passivity, only receiving it, even in the deepest swapnasamadhi which amounts to a practical sushupti of the manas & its silence in the mahat. It was because the system was accustomed to fall into sushupti whenever the manas-buddhi became inert, that this siddhi could not formerly be accomplished. Now the mind becomes inert, sushupta, but ac- tivity proceeds on the vijnanamaya level on which the Purusha is now jagrat in the body, and that activity is received by the inert intellect. Nevertheless owing to the great inertia of the intellect at the time, the thought is sometimes caught with difficulty, hardly remembered on waking, or, if remembered, then soon afterwards lost to the recollection. The intellect catches it, but does not get a good grasp upon it. The vijnanamay memory must become active, if the thought & vision of samadhi are to be remembered. This higher memory is developing, not swe dame, but on the intellectual plane; things are now remembered permanently without committing them to heart, which formerly would not have been remembered even for a day if they had been even carefully learned by heart eg the first verse of Bharatis poem, in Tamil, not a line of which was understood without a laborious cons ultation of the dictionary. Yet"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"188 Record of Yoga although an unknown tongue, although no particular attention was paid to the words or their order everything remains in the mind even after several days. Formerly even a verse of Latin, English, Sanscrit carefully studied & committed to memory, would be lost even in a shorter time. The siddhi of the vijnana samadhi shows that the Purusha is now rising into the vijnana or preparing to rise; the manomaya is becoming passive, the vijnanamaya Purusha, so long secret & veiled by the hiranmaya patra of the buddhi, is beginning to reveal himself, no longer indirectly, but face to face with the lower man. An initial siddhi is also preparing in script communication. As was predicted earlier in the day, the sahitya-siddhi has extended itsel f to poetry this evening & the long obstruction of the poetic faculty is passing away. The epic style has been recovered and only the dramatic remains. Fluency in all will come back during the month, spontaneous & immediate perfection hereafter within these two months . . The lipi is now being freely & naturally utilised for knowledge; there is no farther need of any attention to its development or to the farther development of the vani or script. Only the trikaldrishti & the Power still need attention (apramattata), and the rupadrishti & samadhi still need the help of the Will for their wider development or their more perfect perfection. The siddhi of the vijna[na]maya level for the Thought in samadhi does not extend to the vision; for this reason the dreams are still intellectual records or attempts to record rather than the actual vision of things and events, except when the dream is replaced by vision. Even then it is often savikalpa rather than sadarsha samadhi. The dreams last night (those remembered) were again of consecutive & well connected records; this time the present ego sense was carefully excluded and only once a present association interfered with the accuracy of the record. A rapid movement in trikaldrishti is promised and one in rupa indicated. Jan 10th. Secondary utthapana of neck & legs this morning, but not for long, as the adhogati succeeded in enforcing defect of anima . . The"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 189 morning began with a clouded state, in which however Bhasa & Nirukta [proceeded]; 2 in both the weariness of adhogati born of difficulty is being allowed to manifest according to its power & extruded. It is no longer able to prevent work or stop its continuity, but it can still limit the length of time which can be devoted to a single work & prevent any difficult work or drudgery being pursued unweariedly from day to day [without] 3 intermission. The vijnana is now sufficiently developed for regular literary work to be resumed, but the physical adhogati & alasya has yet to be extruded. For this condition to be fulfilled, the reaction in the physical siddhi (health, utthapana, ananda) has to be got rid of & its forward march resumed. It is promised that this movement will begin today. The obstacle to the trikaldrishti from the enemy which con- sisted in inability to decide on the event, is being removed & those movements which formerly presented themselves falsely and dimly as the event, are now revealed luminously as the thought in the per- son or the force or tendency moving it. Prakamya of the thoughts of others which so often came & went, in a half-clear half-confused movement, has by this success become clear & luminous & its objective sign in the corresponding movement, pause or ingita is so clearly shown that even the intellect cannot doubt the truth and accuracy of the siddhi. There is still confusion as to the time, place & order of circumstance of the event foreseen. The vani, script, lipi and thought are now being used nor- mally & habitually for the life-purposes. The trikaldrishti and prakamyavyapti, alone among the instruments of vijnanamaya knowledge, remain to be drawn into this normal movement. Apramattata is no longer necessary for the ordinary movement of the trikaldrishti, but is still necessary for the trikaldrishti of exact time, place and circumstance; in the prakamya-vyapti it is only necessary in order to prevent errors as to the source of the vyapti or the exact relations of the things perceived. This necessity will today be removed. The action of the power is beginning to be normal, although as yet very far from uniformly successful. 2 MS preceded 3 MS with"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"190 Record of Yoga The clear shabdadrishti, free from adhara, has now definitely begun. The persistent doubt suggested as to the sukshmatwa of the gandhadrishti has now been finally put at rest, for one smell, that of cheese, impossible of material occurrence here has been repeated strongly & persistently in order to dispel the hesitation of the intellect. Rasadrishti is also extending its field, although not yet as vigorous as the gandhadrishti. The necessity of apramattata has been removed from all the parts of the vijnanasiddhi except rupadrishti and samadhi; the rest will be accomplished henceforth by the unaided direct action of the Para Shakti. Rupa developed to a certain extent, but still fails to overcome its one remaining difficulty. Swapnasamadhi was absent; the dreams, though clear & consecutive, slightly confused by the mixing of historical names (not thought of for years past,) and one or two present associations with the actual chain of incidents. The present ego was also prominent in the central figure. A violent struggle over the roga (digestive) began with suc- cess, passed through failure and ended again in success. There has been a strong reaction of asiddhi in the roga ending today in an attack of incipient diarrhoea, but the sense of health was persistent throughout & the whole system except the pure bodily part, remained unaffected by the attack. Even the body was free from any loss of strength or ananda; on the contrary the ahaituka ananda was strong not only in the mind but in the prana & the anna. Mukti therefore is almost perfect, although touches of the indriya-nirananda occasionally return. Jan 11 t . h . Contrary to past experience, trikaldrishti was active from the first this morning & its action had not to be resuscitated after the inaction of sleep; but the trikaldrishti of exact time, place & arrangement was in abeyance owing to the dullness of the vijnana in the physical brain. Lipi is also active from the first, but rupa and power in abeyance. “Today the dasya in the third degree will be confirmed, the rupadrishti overcome its last obstacle, the samadhi develop in its deficient parts, the secondary utthapana progress. Kamananda will"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 191 reassert its control & the shadow that has materialised in the health be removed. The action of the Will will pass over entirely into the fourth chatusthaya, in which Power will establish its control. Trikaldrishti will become more widely active.” Afternoon. The samadhi is developing in its deficient parts, lipi in swapna- samadhi, shabdadrishti in jagrat, but the development is slow and impeded. Swapna-samadhi by flashes is frequent, but still fails to hold the vijnanamay level or to attain continuity. Secondary ut- thapana made slight progress before the prediction was written. The action of the Will is passing away from the rupadrishti & the samadhi, but not yet passed. The Power is working on the body & has already diminished the abnormal insistence of the jalavisrishti & got rid of the stress of the abnormal parthiva visrishti. There is strong resistance to the fulfilment and the mental parts have been all day in a state of confused action. Nothing clear & decisive yet emerges. The news today are the reverse of favourable, although in consonance with the trikaldrishti, which expected the emergence of a yet stronger trend against Turkey. Aiswarya in the karma is strongly hampered and to a certain extent baffled. The subjective ananda took possession in full force this morn- ing, a harmony of suddha, chidghana, ahaituka, premananda & sahaituka sharirananda, but the kamananda is resisted and the exclusion of the ananda from adverse events was successfully at- tempted by the enemy. In the evening perfect forms directly under the eye became numerous and a number of them stable, but these were not of the most lifelike perfection, the defect being insufficiently developed material; the perfection was in the circumstances. Will has relin- quished the rupadrishti to the self-action of the Para Prakriti, and is only slightly active for the samadhi. Swapna-samadhi is attempting to develop continuity, but is obliged to have recourse to recur- rence in order to stimulate the tendency, as the habit of the drishti withdrawing immediately from the thing once it is seen, still pre- vails. Kamananda chiefly sahaituka was resumed, but not yet with a sustained frequency. Power began to control the bodily siddhi,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"192 Record of Yoga but not yet with entire success; the jalavisrishti at last revived its intensity and the relics of sensitiveness to cold with nirananda sud- denly recovered intensity. Secondary utthapana, attempted, failed to progress sensibly; but the primary utthapana overcame easily an attempt to break it and continued strongly from about five to after half past eleven (walking all the time) with only a break for meals. Sleep at night fell from 7 or 8 hours to five. Trikaldrishti manifested a striking power and accuracy. The resistance to Power in the karma showed itself in a fresh outbreak of anaikya in the surroundings, known by trikaldrishti before it happened. Jan 12 th . Todays telegrams show remarkably the action of the Power & the vyapti-prakamya, more especially (1) In the Austro-Italian claim of Janina, Scutari and Prizrend for Albania; (2) in the threatened action of Roumania with regard to the Bulgarian territory; (3) in the firm attitude of the Turks & especially in their refusal to be intimidated by the threat of a naval demonstration; (4) in the comparatively mild action of the Powers with regard to Adrianople. All these are instances of the accurate action of ishita-vyapti-aishwarya in details; but the final result is still a matter of dispute between the siddhi and the asiddhi. An instance of perfect final result occurs today in the Insurance Act matter, the completion of panels all over Great Britain and the enrolment of 15,000 doctors . . Yesterdays prediction, although not unfulfilled, was pitched in a key too high for the actual sthula fulfilment.

This high pitch, however, is intended, as these predictions are programmes or pratijnas rather than mere prediction, & the fulfilment has to rise to the pitch of the prediction, not the prediction fall to the pitch of the sthula fulfilment. 4 “Today the tertiary dasya will become decisive and prepare to pass into the fourth degree or supreme dasya; rupadrishti & samadhi farther progress on yesterdays lines; trikaldrishti become at once great (mahat) and striking. Health will farther extrude the relics of the old symptomatic survivals, subject to some far- ther struggle; secondary utthapana declare itself more clearly; ka- mananda overcome the obstacles still presented to it; the general bodily power greatly increase. Aishwarya after making itself felt in the rest of the physical siddhi, will throw itself on the saundarya and the karma, which will begin to develop larger proportions. But the chief movement will be the final emergence and justification of the Mahakali element in its shuddha Asuric bhava.” Afternoon The tertiary dasya has become decisive, trikaldrishti continues to produce striking results, but its mahattwa is faulty when applied by the Mahakali movement. In samadhi the clearness, consecutive- ness & frequency of lipi increases & the tendency to continuity con- tinues, but today the Will was not used. The struggle in the health continues; jalavisrishti is virulent, the semi-tejasic parthiva visrishti dominated, but not yet entirely dislodged in tendency; other symp- toms also cling. The Mahakali element has emerged but is not yet justified. Instances of opposition to the karma have abounded today, even in the midst of the preparation for a larger activity of the karma.

Trikaldrishti continues to be striking & has a wide range, but is variable & uncertain in its action. In health the movement of extru- sion progressed with great difficulty, &, although it seems to have succeeded, it is too early as yet to estimate the progress. Secondary utthapana progresses & the bodily power (tejo balam mahattwam pravrittih) greatly increases; but the kamananda did not overcome its obstacles, but rather manifested itself occasionally, especially in the sukshma body as madira, in spite of them. Aishwarya is applying itself more consistently to karma and saundarya. The Mahakali action is apparently established & sanctioned, but not yet justified by results. Jan 13 t . h . . Dasya is of four degrees, first, the dasya of the servant who obeys of his own free will or for a hire and can always refuse obedience; secondly, the dasya of the lover who might disobey, but does not & in a way cannot; thirdly, the dasya of the yantra, which cannot disobey, but is worked mechanically through an in- termediate impulsion of Prakriti; fourthly, the dasya of the supreme degree which obeys helplessly the direct impulse of the Master and combines in itself, yet exceeds, the other three. It is this dasya which has to become the normal form of activity from today. It will be the dasya of the Mahakali bhava in the Mahasaraswati Prakriti.

The exceptions resolve themselves (1) to exaggerated tapas & stress on true perceptions, & (2) unfulfilled volitions. For example, a kite flying, a particular line of change of flight was suggested & the tapas laid upon it, another occurred to the intellect, but received scant attention; the kite followed, first, the second line & then the first. Mere speculative possibility seems to have disappeared from the trikaldrishti and to be replaced by actuality & actual possibilities (eg actual intentions, tendencies) & by the volition of possibilities. The latter source of anritam has to be removed by the rejection of volitions that are not to be fulfilled & the fulfilment of taijasa trikaldrishti and this process has already commenced.

Things seen were a darbar hall, the interior of an Indian house, a door in a river-steamer, a long railway- saloon, several figures; the rest are forgotten. Tamasic nidra could not be extruded from the swapna samadhi, which had finally to be abandoned. In the trikaldrishti knowledge of the past, of past lives, of feelings, thoughts & motives of people in the past is becoming normally active. It has been suggested that Aishwarya should be renounced in the physical siddhi except saundarya; but owing to the persistence of physical asiddhi, tejas in the assimilative process, virulent jalavisrishti, i nhibition of kamananda (except in the form of madira and sukshma sahaituka kamananda), etc, the mental shakti & its anucharas are unwilling to accept this suggestion as anything but a false & premature movement of with- drawal. The personality of the Master, long held back, remanifests in Script. Rupadrishti still develops slowly, a little more stability in the Akashic forms, the appearance of a momentarily stable perfect rupa in the daylight. The dreams at night were all about the relations in other lives with a single person and his surroundings, but the associations of the present were more insistent than they have been for some time past and confused the record. In swapna samadhi a certain initial continuity seems to have been established. There is a strong attack of asiddhi in the karma. Prakamya- vyapti with regard to the results of the cricket match were correct, but not very correct; about the mad patient entirely wrong. In both cases tejasic tapas of volition interfered with the truth. The atmosphere of the house is full of the struggle and the opposition to the dharma of the satyayuga of which the assistants of the satyayuga are the chief instruments owing to their clinging to their egoism and small selfishnesses. The struggle in the body centres about the tejas in the assimilation which seeks to prolong its abnormal activity."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"198 Record of Yoga Jan 14 th . There is a growing passivity in the intelligence and the phys- ical struggle is being made the instrument for the renunciation of intellectual judgment, the remnants of which are at present the chief obstacle to the possession of the whole system by the vijnana. Trikaldrishti & jnana are taking possession of the script, the vanis, the thought perceptions as well as the vangmaya thought, but the process cannot be completed owing to the excessive tapas, tejasic or tamasic, on the thing seen which converts a truth into a falsehood by overstressing it & so overprolonging its applicability in time or place or exaggerating its results. The perception of the locality of things or people not seen or their personality or nature is becoming stronger, but not yet sufficiently precise; e.g. a thing not found, it is at once known whether it is in the room or not and vaguely indicated that it is in such a place or in a place of such and such a nature, anyone knocking at the door, it is indicated who is at the door or else what class of person; in the morning, it is invariably indicated whether the girl is coming immediately, a little later or much later etc. If once the excess of tapas is removed, there is no reason why intellectual infallibility should not be established; for then the other obstacle of uncertainty will have nothing on which to feed its existence. The fulfilment of the powers of Knowl- edge & the accomplishment of the divine Satyam are therefore certain, although the time of fulfilment is not yet revealed; for after the general working of the power is established without defect, there will still remain its perfect application to Bhasha, Nirukta, Itihasa, Darshana, Kala, Dravyajnana etc. The powers of Force, Kriy ˆ ashakti, are less surely developed, although they are growing, & their success in particular instances is slow, often uncertain, in many things inoperative, especially in the objective world, but also in the subjective. It is this difficulty & opposition which has to be attacked in its centre by applying the Powers to the karma and to objective happenings and movements. In yesterdays programme, only the first item was thoroughly fulfilled. In the second, there was a progress; the samadhi overcame the obstacle to continuity, but the continuity attained was slight; the rupadrishti succeeded only in the barest possible manner, the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 199 momentary stability of a perfect form, the longer stability of a form developed but not sufficient in material substance. Aishwarya began the movement towards generalising success, by trying to get rid of such willings as are not consonant with the central movement of the Supreme Will, but the process is not yet complete; the struggle continued in health, utthapana & kamananda, but they did not prevail, except in effecting an obscure, moderate & preparatory success & in strengthening the force of their sukshma vaja or subtle material substance, of which, however, shansa, the actual bringing out into material being has not yet been realised.

The discomfort touches but is easily extruded by substituting the ananda of the discomfort. Discomfort of roga still exists when it is yielded to, but is attended always with ananda of the sensation or else with ananda of the discomfort, unless the opposite, nirananda, is encouraged. Discomfort of acute pain is still the one thing not yet really mastered by the Ananda, but that defect has been purposely left for gradual & later extrusion; even this discomfort is up to a certain point attended by ananda or replaced by ananda & overcomes, usually, only on the first sudden & unexpected attack when the Chit in the system is off its guard. There is also discomfort of adverse result & opposition but this too is being rapidly replaced by the ananda. There is a vague remnant of sanskara of discomfort in the vishayananda, but it is purely a mental sanskara & does not usually negative, though it often impairs the ananda of the physical indriya, eg there is a sensation of shrinking in the karmadehas mental sanskara from the first touch of very cold water, but the moment the water reaches the skin, ananda and not nirananda is the result. Kamananda this morning is extending itself as madiramay ananda and entering into the raudra and other anandas; as yet it does not hold the body, but affects it with a prolonged sparsha. The weakness of the kamachakra is the chief obstacle. Dasya has already passed into the fourth degree, but there is a lingering sanskara of the tertiary dasya in some of the physical, mental & emotional activities the stamp of the Master is not yet everywhere. But the lipi which has recently been promising the “death of the difficulties”, is being amply fulfilled in the three first chatusthayas and in the sixth and seventh. The increase of dasya is attended by an increase of prakasha and sraddha; but the doubt holds as to the time and the extent of the siddhi.

Samadhi has been antardrishta jagrat with lipi and thought. There was proof of an increased bodily force and pravritti, but not yet of sufficient dharanasamarthyam (dhriti, sthairyam) of a single occupation. Yet it is alleged that [two of the] 7 essential requisites demanded before the literary work could be allowed to recommence, play of vijnana and sufficient primary utthapana both in body & brain, are already accomplished, though they have to be confirmed in the karma; but the third, equipment, is yet wanting. Aishwarya is generalising itself slowly, but has not yet got rid of the mere tapasic volition which can create a force or tendency, but not produce the required effect. The perfect aishwarya either produces an immediate partic- ular effect, (that being the limit of the thing willed), or a final result, without regard to the immediate or intermediate steps, or produces a final result through or subsequent to certain particular steps which may constitute the whole or a part of the apparent nimitta (imme- diate karana) of the final effect (karya). The first form is already strong and frequent, the second works, but with great slowness and infrequency, the third is yet rare & undeveloped. Trikaldrishti is effecting its siddhi with regard (1) to place, (2) to ordinarily unforeseeable effect. Rupadrishti is developing, in the daylight, long stability of images complete and incomplete and variety of image, (tejas, chhaya, chhayamay, tejomay & agnimaya varna). Script is free and active. Consideration of kartavyam akartavyam is finally disappearing, in its remnants, out of the supreme dasya.

Yesterdays programme was amply fulfilled in the trikaldrishti and kamananda; rupadrishti & samadhi advanced very little; aish- warya began to generalise itself; secondary utthapana increased in innate force but was less in duration; arogya continued with some success, but not complete success its struggle to exclude the symptomatic touches. Tejas in the assimilation is still the principal defect. Programme Trikaldrishti to widen entirely and get rid of variability, ie of its moments of reversion to the old activity of the intelligence, but not yet of uncertainty. Aishwarya to generalise its successful movement. Rupadrishti and samadhi to prevail in their struggle. Kamananda to triumph. Secondary utthapana to generalise itself in its minor movement. Health to persevere in its successful struggle. The general subjective ananda, after the test of several days experience, may be now considered permanently established & continuous in its shuddha, ahaituka and chidghana parts, about to be continuous in its prema part. In the sharira the sahaituka is established, although as yet without intensity or firm continuity, the ahaituka awaits the triumphant event of the kamananda. It exists, but is infrequent. The bhukti is nearing fulfilment. Trikaldrishti is now, mainly, defective in audacity; the mind refuses to admit improbabilities or things not expected to happen. The movement is now towards the removal of this defect, which founds its strength upon past experience, by giving the opposite experience. Eg yesterday, there was the lipi “Journalism” & “Les journalistes”; the mind refused to admit any possible immediate application, but the same evening P [Parthasarathi] came with the proposal of a weekly or biweekly sheet. Today the trikaldrishti shows a general completeness of stuff, ie every suggestion is shown to be correct in itself, but there is confusion in the mental use of the stuff, ie in fixing the suggestion to its correct particular of person,"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 203 time & place. These two movements, firm establishment of ahaituka kamananda and full mahattwa of the trikaldrishti have to be effected and confirmed today & accompanied the one by the development of other ahaituka shariranandas, the other by the clearing away of the accompanying confusion. Lipi, rupa & samadhi, the three allied movements necessary to visvagati have to be delivered from the obstruction surrounding their activity in the akasha. These three movements constitute the central part of todays programme. Afternoon In the morning trikaldrishti passed rapidly through several stages, applying [itself] 8 correctly with speed to a series of inci- dents, foreseeing a series of a single incident repeated beforehand, without any data and contrary to experience, assembling a mass of perceptions and arranging them with more or less accuracy. The process still continues. Aishwarya generalised success, but the success which comes slowly & with some effort, after some resistance. Rupadrishti was strengthened and kept in the akash forms perfect in all respects except a certain tenuity of material & a certain aloofness from the front layer of the sthula akash. The strongest movements were in samadhi and kamananda. In the antardrishta jagrat samadhi lipi organised itself & stable crude rupa, perfect in outline, completeness, clearness, stability, in all but steadiness of material & vividness, was manifested, as well as crude rupa deficient only in firm vividness. Lipi is not yet sure of stability. In the swapna samadhi images abounded and some showed continuity or both combination & continuity, eg a shaggy dog, lean & miserable-looking, trotting up to a wall & smelling it, the wall returning & remaining after eclipse, crude, the sound of a small silver piece falling & a stout man near a window looking for it & picking it up, the man becoming vague after eclipse, but the window remaining vivid. In both the rupa & lipi have today become organised for use, especially for trikaldrishti & the samadhi generally for jnana & trikaldrishti. In the antardrishta symbolic colours are again returning, eg Ss [aura], green brilliant, blue black 8 MS its"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"204 Record of Yoga tending to be blue, but often dulled into grey, uncertain suffusion of red from a blood-red sun; also, symbolic images, eg, in the same connection an unhatched egg replaced by a crown. Kamananda was entirely triumphant flooding the sukshma deha, seizing the sukshma parts of the body & touching its sthula parts with an intenser ananda than has ever been experienced before, equal to the first movements of the actual maithuna ananda. In the morning this came repeatedly, thrice, with hardly any interval and was each time continued for some time, & in the afternoon the ananda has returned and although, not so intense, is more persistent. There are also touches of ahaituka rudrananda and ahaituka tivra, negative vaidyuta & vishaya. The ananda now comes & continues even when the mind is otherwise occupied. Todays telegrams. The Viceroys health almost answered to the Aishwarya as within the first fortnight of [January], 9 the time fixed, he was able to go out for a drive; but the premature exertion has brought back a return of restlessness at night & neuritis in the arm. The trikaldrishti is fulfilled in both the favourable & adverse move- ments, only the Aishwarya is slightly baffled. As foreseen, there is no result from the two witnesses summoned. Again, as foreseen to be willed by the Ishwara only recently, there have been fresh aviation accidents, more storms & wrecks and a serious railway accident all in the news of a single day; all occurred in England, but this was not foreseen. The revolt of Nature against machinery continues. The stage now reached by the trikaldrishti is one in which sraddha, blind faith, is demanded in all suggestions which are not corrected by the viveka. The mind is to question nothing & correct nothing. If this is done, then the faith will be justified by absolute truth being established. A similar faith is demanded for the fulfil- ment of aishwarya, ishita, vyapti, although the full justification will be a little slower in coming. In fact, this movement of faith has to cover the whole range of the vijnanamaya activity. The first results of this movement of sraddha were adverse, as the enemy who now fight from a distance only in these matters, 9 MS February"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 205 sent in strong & persistent volitions of possibility like a cloud of arrows to confuse the knowledge & destroy the faith; afterwards the movement was righted with the result that the whole vijnana is now acting normally & uninterruptedly & variability in the instru- ments of knowledge & power need no longer be feared, except the minor variability of greater or less force & perfection. Trikaldrishti & aishwarya do not yet act with absolute perfection or unerring success, for volition of possibility is still active & exact time, place & circumstance are still the exception rather than the rule in both power & objective knowledge. The uncertainty therefore remains; but normally the trikaldrishti is roughly correct or often exactly correct even as regards place and circumstance, less so as regards time & order, & the fulfilment, normal or striking, slow or rapid, of the power is now more the normal movement than its entire or final failure. Arogya is steadily reestablishing itself, but there are still one or two serious defects. The slow therapeutic power works except in particular cases, the swift therapeutic power which showed itself once or twice at an earlier stage, is conspicuously absent except in very minor movements or in cases in which little interest is taken or little power is used, for these the enemy do not think it worth while to oppose. Rupa in the evening did not progress beyond its previous point of attainment, except in shabdadrishti where there was drishti of a tea canister and the clear sound of setting it down. Secondary utthapana was applied to the neck, back and legs and in all positions showed a great force of mahima, anima and laghima, but the anima fails and with it the mahima after a space of time varying from two to five minutes. Laghima is sufficient, if not contradicted by the defect of anima. The failure of mahima is due, essentially, to an element of physical tapas (muscular strain) which still adheres to the action; if this were not present, the insistence of defective anima would not be so powerful. Dream was for the first time entirely discharged of present ego, present associations and present images, except for one attempt to identify present custom in eating with the manners presented in the dream; there was, however, this deficiency that the dream consciousness followed the internal movements of"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"206 Record of Yoga the central figure one not myself and only observed the external movements of others. This defect has to be remedied. Kamananda is persistent in the less intense form, but not always present. Secondary utthapana and kamananda have entirely fulfilled the programme, also health; samadhi has prevailed, except in bring- ing about long continuity in the swapna and developed rupa in the antardrishta; rupadrishti has had only a slight success. Aishwarya and trikaldrishti have followed the lines laid down for them, but the movement is not yet complete. Jan 16th. Programme 1. Trikaldrishti has now to replace entirely the action of the intelligence; that is, nothing has to be done by judgment, logical reason, speculative imagination, sanskara born of memory; but even the most trifling and unimportant things have to be known by vijnana agencies. Where vijnana does not give light, there has to be no judgment, conclusion or even speculation. Aishwarya has to be utilised only where there is perception of the Divine Will behind; it has no longer to reflect in any way the movements of the manomaya Purusha or the manomaya Shakti. Lipi has to get rid of the obstacle in the Akasha which prevents it from manifesting with a successful and easy vividness. Rupa & Samadhi have to continue their struggle and progressively prevail. 2. Kamananda has now to move towards continuity of the more intense form and entire continuity of the less intense. Arogya has to expel the symp- tomatic survivals in the assimilation and kamachakra. Secondary utthapana, established in its generalised activity, has to increase the force of pure mahima and of anima. Saundarya must still struggle with its obstacle without as yet prevailing and the Aishwarya with the obstacle to the equipment.

The mornings siddhi has been noted for the final separation of the volition of possibility from the perception of actuality, of kratu from ketu. All such volitions are at once set aside by vivek acting on the mind as unreliable, not trikaldrishti; the only difficulty left is that the perception itself, of an actual intention or tendency, is sometimes overstressed into an apparent perception of eventuality, but this is in course of being corrected. As a result, error is now very slight and rapidly corrected, u sually before it is falsified by the event. Many true perceptions are still doubted or not sufficiently stressed for fear of error; but this defect can be remedied effectually as soon as the habit of overstress itself is expelled. Aishwarya also is getting rid of false tapas and, when exercised, produces its effect. Lipi is strong in the sthula akash as chitralipi, but still uncertain as akashalipi. Dasya of the fourth degree is now dominant; whenever the attention of the Chit follows the action, it is aware of the turiya dasyabuddhi, whether in motion, speech, emotion or thought, except for a slight intermixture of merely Prakritic impulse in the thinking powers. This is true even of such involuntary motions as the closing or blinking of the eyelids, nimishannapi or the direction of the gaze. The sixth or Brahma chatusthaya is similarly estab- lished; the general (samena samavasthita) sarvam anantam jnanam anandam Brahma is seen everywhere, when the attention is awake. The nitya anusmaran is not established as yet, nor can it be estab- lished unless there is the capacity of multiple sanyama, ie naturally and normally dividing the tapas of the Chit between several things at a time.

Sthapatyalipi shows a movement of remanifestation. Samadhi was barren of any progress, but did not go backward. In the evening Rupadrishti developed in the crudest forms a greater variety and completeness. Samadhi at night was barren & the dreams confused in record. Aishwarya showed a considerable increase in force and each exercise of will was successful. Vijnana became active, though not yet well-harmonised, in its various parts and lipi more in possession of the akasha, though still obliged to use an effort in order to manifest; there was a perfect intelligibility and appositeness in most of the lipis and a full play of interpretation of the various objective materials of trikaldrishti. The subjective pow- ers of knowledge have passed their period of effort and difficulty; only the objective material is still unable to deploy itself easily & richly in the material akasha. Power is beginning to accomplish its firm mastery, although still hampered in the matter of equipment and slow in other provinces. There is fresh proof of its efficacy in karma. Jan 17 t . h . . The final development of Aishwarya has been definitely under- taken. Aishwarya in effect is of three kinds, 1, that which creates a tendency or produces an effect, but does not eventually or at all succeed; 2, that which produces the final effect, but slowly, with difficulty, against an effective resistance; 3, that which produces the final effect not as a combatant, but victoriously as a master. The first has to be eliminated from the siddhi henceforth; the second to be preserved for a time, the third to be continually strengthened until it replaces all the others. Programme. Yesterdays programme has to be completed; trikaldrishti has to get rid of the remnants of false stress which constitute now its one remaining positive defect; aishwarya to illumine itself with knowledge of the Divine Will, for up till now it has only got rid of the urgency which impelled it to employ itself blindly and merely for exercise. It has also to confirm the movement excluding ineffectual"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 209 applications. Lipi has attained to successful vividness; it has still to attain to easy vividness. Rupa & Samadhi must continue their struggle. Kamananda successful in the afternoon was slight and rare in the evening; it must expel the hesitation in the body which prevents it from domiciling itself in the sthula. Arogya, although much stronger, does not yet exclude the return of the symptoms which it has expelled; these affections must now be compelled to disappear. Secondary utthapana, which maintained in the afternoon and at night its efficiency except for a stronger attack of adhogati and defective anima, must increase the force of pure mahima in order to combat this deficiency. The matter of the equipment has now been handed over to the passive Ishita; it is the one point of almost complete unsuccess which still prevents faith in the adeshasiddhi from attaining to self- confidence and fullness, although the failure of the saundarya to emerge is a powerful auxiliary obstacle. The news today confirms the trikaldrishti, especially vyapti- prakamya in a striking fashion eg the hesitations in Constantino- ple, the fears of the Ministers about disruption and defeat, the want of real unanimity among the Powers, the easier state, yet continuance, of the Roumanian difficulty, fresh wrecks etc. One unexpected event is the murder at Comilla. The old trikaldrishti & sortilege about the frequency of wrecks is confirmed by todays telegram giving the number lost in 1912 as 228 (82 British). The working of the aishwarya-vyapti-ishita in great matters is also very evident in the movement of the subjectivity everywhere and to a great extent in the movement of the subjective objectivity, but it is still very deficient in the objective results, effective, but only partially effective. The basis of the adeshasiddhi & karmasiddhi is being erected, but it is not as yet sufficiently firm or sufficiently wide. A larger movement of the vijnanasiddhi is commencing today, in which it will be unnecessary to note every minute advance. Per- fect passivity is its basis; brihat, vast abundance will be its field; satyam its atmosphere; ritam its line of definiteness. Mechanical perfection will spontaneously emerge in its apas.

Rupa this morning has followed up the movement of the night in crude forms. In the afternoon it has remanifested frequent chitra rupa and sthapatya rupa; both of these forms have at once taken possession of their old perfection in single figures, groups and landscapes. Lipi in the afternoon has attained to easy vividness, although there is still a certain difficulty and malaise in its movement, coming and staying, though much less in the chitra & sthapatya than in akasha lipi. In trikaldrishti the movement is towards the perfect correctness even of all the random external suggestions unverified by the viveka, but this is still subject to a certain inaccuracy of exact detail. Rupa & swapna samadhi are now moving in the direction, first, of abundance, secondly, of the recovery of the old activities that have been lost by the action of the Vritras, thirdly, of the per- fection of their materials. Dream at night was frequently confused. The physical siddhi suffered a slight reaction. January 18th. Trikaldrishti, that there would be news of an arrest today in Comilla; confirmed, but there were two arrests. Also, another wreck. Aishwarya successful & prakamya-vyapti justified in the attitude of the Triple Alliance, especially Italy, and the dropping of the Naval Demonstration. Today has been a day of attack by the enemy and difficult survival of the gains of the siddhi, lipi maintaining itself, but mani- festing with difficulty in the akash, trikaldrishti chequered by false suggestion and aishwarya successfully resisted and almost entirely overcome. Rupadrishti & samadhi have made no advance. The cause of the difficulty & the opportunity of the attack has been the necessity of finally establishing the harmony of pravritti with nivritti, tapas & tejas with shanti & dasya. The habit of the Na- ture acquired by long practice in the sadhana has been to insist on shanti, udasinata, & passivity as the condition of progress. It is now necessary to overlay & fill the shanti, udasinata, & passivity, the Maheshwari basis, with an active & even violent"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 211 & rapid tapas of Mahakali-Mahasaraswati; but the habitual re- action of failure caused by the irruption of false tejas & false tapas has first to be eliminated before the harmonisation can be managed. Since the above was written, prediction in the script has been justified; “Successful struggle in vijnana during the rest of the day, triumph in the evening. Rupa develops brihat with difficult[y], not yet perfection except in single figures.” The struggle in the afternoon was successful in maintaining the minimum gains of the siddhi; in the evening the siddhi has triumphed, restored the akashalipi to its fullness, although it is still laboured, brought aishwarya forward, without as yet being able to get rid of ineffective aishwarya, devel- oped a fair abundance of rupas (chitra, sthapatya, akasha) but with perfection & stability in the akasha only for some crude forms & some crude dense & crude developed, these, however, are entirely perfect, and began to justify tejas & tapas in their results. It is now increasingly evident that the condition of success in the future is the broad and general activity of the vijnana including in itself all the members of the third chatusthaya and not any longer the separate development of each member by itself. Nothing fresh in the evening and night; activity of vijnana, rupadrishti, samadhi, but no definite progress. Jan 19 th . This morning script became profuse and intimate and the old siddhis of aitihya lipi & janmantara drishti resumed their activ- ity. 10 The latter has never been entirely suspended, but it will now work normally. Trikaldrishti again justified by the fresh wreck and aishwarya by the election of Poincar ́ e as Republican Candidate; trikaldrishti (vyapti-prakamya) by the release on bail of the Comilla suspect. The main movement of trikaldrishti today is towards complete independence from its intellectual couch of data.

Kamananda has been continuous in varying degrees of intensity from before noon till now (towards 5 oclock in the afternoon) and promises to remain continuous throughout the day. The tendency of emergence in rupadrishti is strong, but the habitual obstruction in the akasha does not yield finally except for chitra & sthapatya. Kamananda remained continuous as a tendency throughout the evening, but lost hold of the body, nor could rupadrishti suc- cessfully emerge, owing to a return of the old struggle between the exaggerations of uninformed tejas in the mentality & the de- spondency & unfaith caused by asatya. Dream & swapna samadhi maintained their gains, but did not advance. Jan 20 th It would seem today as if the exaggerated tejas of mentality were finally dismissed from action as a result of last nights repeti- tion of the old form of purificatory disturbance and crisis. Sthapatya & chitra rupa now manifest with considerable perfection and fre- quency. There is a movement towards the expulsion of the fragmen- tary recurrence of discomfort in particular sights, sounds, touches, smells which mars the perfection of the vishayananda (bhoga) in the indriyas. Manas in physical prana & manas in psychical prana may still keep recurrences of discomfort for a time, so that discomfort of physical pain and discomfort of apriya event may for a while survive; but there is no farther justification for the persistence of discomfort of apriya vishaya to the senses. The day was mainly occupied with a struggle to enforce the freedom of the vijnana in all its parts. Rupa in chitra and sthapatya became very abundant; aiswarya increased remarkably in force, & trikaldrishti showed a tendency towards minute exactness. Kamananda was continuous in tendency, comparatively frequent in intensity, persistently recurrent in slighter manifestation. Arogya is increasing in force, but not yet victorious over its obstacle; utthapana variable."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 213 Jan 21 s . t . Aishwarya-vyapti once more effective in subjective objectivity with a striking exactness; for the Turkish draft reply to the Note is couched in exactly the terms and contained exactly the reasons about Adrianople that had been suggested; even the modification about the Aegean islands, viz. the insistence on the coast islands alone, is the one that from the beginning was suggested & contin- ually maintained by the thought and the ishita. Aishwarya also in Poincar ́ es election which seems at one point to have been in jeop- ardy. The progress in the vijnana chatusthaya & the kamananda now continues like that of a creeping tide, throwing up waves always higher and seeming to retreat or rest for a moment, but in the result always advancing. Only in the physical siddhi other than ananda this movement as yet fails to establish itself. In the evening it took a much larger sweep and even the rupadrishti, which is the most sluggish of all the vijnana siddhis, began to manifest abun- dance. The lipi given a few days ago “rupas by the milliards”, is now being accomplished, as already in chitra & sthapatya images are coming multitudinously and the salamba chitras & salamba rupas are beginning to follow suit. Crudeness, inconstancy & want of firm outline are the rule; on the other hand they have often great richness of colouring and not infrequent perfection of form, sometimes even of outline. The perfect developed or lifelike forms still occur, but rarely. In samadhi continuity of scene & action seem at last to be established, but only for the single act; still this minor continuity has occurred even in the jagrat antardrishta. The physical siddhi is obstinately disputed, especially health; even the kamananda is forcibly interrupted. Nevertheless this great change has been established in the sanskaras of the body that, while for- merly it felt release from the continued ananda as a relief and as its normal condition of purity & freedom, now it feels continuity of it to be its normal condition and absence of it to be not purity but want, not freedom but a bondage.

The improvement in the swapna-samadhi maintains itself. The atmo- sphere of kamananda has been constant, under strong ordeals, throughout the day, except for slight interruptions. This siddhi is in future sure of its natural development. The stress of the ishita has passed on to the arogyasiddhi especially and in a less degree to the saundarya and karmasiddhi. Arogya, during the day, was greatly strengthened, but dull symptomatic survivals still remain to hamper it. Coherent dream-record with only a slight admixture of present ego, present association and consequent confusion seems to be now well established. Sometimes present ego is entirely absent, sometimes present association, sometimes the resulting confusion; at times one or other of these defects gains in stress. In rare in- stances all are absent and the only defects of the record are those of omission of details necessary for perfect understanding. Jan 23 d .. Today the aishwarya & trikaldrishti suddenly developed an unprecedented force; while watching the movement of ants on the wall opposite, it was suddenly perceived that every slightest movement of the particular ant observed in each case followed the anticipatory observation; wherever my idea turned, there the ant, with but slight variations, immediately corrected, turned to follow it; when the forceful will was applied, there was some- times a slight, but unavailing struggle. This observation covered some half hundred successive movements of various ants and was marred by only one actual & final failure. If this force can be rendered permanent & generalised so as to apply to all objects & subjects, then human omniscience & omnipotence in the field permitted by the Infinite are attained. It is a matter of time only; the perfectibility of knowledge & power have today been finally & irrevocably proved. There is, however, one defect, that if the movement willed be contrary to the stream of the apas in purpose or in nature, the obedience given is either slight or temporary or, even when it seems to be final, subject to a sudden return of the old unfulfilled impulse.

The days news about the Turkish acceptance of the Powers Note is a success for the trikaldrishti (vyaptiprakamya) & for the Aishwarya for the conclusion of peace, but a violent defeat for the Aishwarya about the terms of peace which were either the coast islands should be retained and Adrianople either not ceded or ceded with dismantled fortifications or war. This morning kamananda of a great intensity continued for a long time and the ordinary level of intensity has also been raised; the ananda is still continuous at the time of writing. (afternoon.) Subsequently, the ananda increased to a yet greater intensity & gave the first definite hint of what it will be when it is firmly and uninterruptedly in possession of the sthula body. It subsided for a time at mealtime without actually disappearing, but, now, immediately after meals, is again active. It continues even when walking or absorbed in other work or thought, but is less firm then and does not attain to the full intensity. Lipi in the morning attained its full spontaneous materiality and is in the course of attaining its full freedom of profuse manifestation. Samadhi, deepest swapna, with fairly numerous images, scenes, a freer lipi, thought & vani sometimes quite coherent and one perfect & vivid varnamaya picture of a woman of high rank in some ancient age in a pillared room open upon a court having her toilette done by slaves. This is the first time that there has been a consistent jagrat condition of the manas in so profound a state of the swapnasamadhi; the defects that remain are the fleeting character of the images, a too rapid passing from one thought to another not connected with it and an occasional mixture of records and thoughts. Abundance of rupa has begun definitely in addition to abun- dance of lipi. The chitra & sthapatya were already abundant and are now redeveloping an extraordinary minuteness of perfection; a bas-relief figure not so long as the thumbnail, is sometimes per- fect in its details, eye, ear, beard, hat up to the buttons of the coat & frequently in the facial expression and bhava of the body."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"216 Record of Yoga Perfect landscapes, vivid groups are also frequent. Sketches are multitudinous. But now freedom & abundance are coming in the akasharupa along with vividness, variety & sufficient stability. The defects of blur, vagueness, inconstancy of outline, paucity & infirm- ness of material are being surmounted. Kamananda in continuity still persists (nearly 6 pm) & is attempting to establish a high degree of continuous intensity as its usual pitch. With one short interval of half an hour, it has now been continuous for nearly ten hours. [Written] 25 th Jan. Akasha rupa developed freedom and vividness. Kamananda continued throughout the evening till retirement, but much di- minished and sometimes quiescent. The drishtis (shabda etc) were delivered from the hesitations of the intellect by definite proof of sparsha other than the touch of rain and prakasha of the truth of the other drishtis, subsequently sparshadrishti received a great increase of intensity and rain & wind of the other world were actually felt as in the jail not in touches but in a composite & well-materialised experience. At night dream remained stationary. Jan 25 t . h . Todays news corrects yesterdays failure. Recent trikaldrishtis have been that the Cabinet was hopeless of relieving Adrianople or of doing more than holding out at Tchataldja, that money was lacking and that the Russians were threatening an invasion of Asi- atic Turkey; that Kiamil Pasha was hesitating whether to hold out or yield or resign; that in the Army & City there was profound dissatisfaction. All these have been justified. Aishwarya has been that the Note of the Powers should be rejected, but not cavalierly; that the Islands of the coast & Adrianople should be insisted on or else Kiamil resign; that there should be a change of military command and a Cabinet containing the chief Young Turks and, if possible, others determined to hold out, should come in. Today this Aishwarya has been in substance fulfilled. The situation is felt to be full of dangers (Abdulla Pacha, the Powers, Russia, lack of money, possible defeat,) but also there are possibilities if the Aishwarya can prevail (sympathy of Triple Alliance, at least Austria & Germany,"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 217 energy of the Young Turks, desire of the army for war, finally, the Aishwarya itself, which is growing stronger every day). No definite trikaldrishti of the result arrives, unless the lipi indications “Tchorlu. Lules Burgas”, belong to the present time. The trikaldrishti is now in a state in which a throng of true perceptions constantly present themselves, but cannot yet be given their right value. Eg yesterday, the crude rupa of a prawn suggested itself and the indication was that there would be prawns for the nights meal; but the mind was afraid to accept the indication both from past experience of error in interpretation of lipi & rupa and because it was at the same time suggested that there would be fish for the nights meal. At the same time it was suggested that the prawn would be for breakfast, this was again negatived in favour of bread for breakfast and prawns for the days meal; but there was no feeling of certainty. As it turned out, there were both prawns and fish for the nights meal, bread for breakfast & prawns and fish again for the days meal. Certainty is unable to establish itself in the midst of this chaos. It is only when there is no attempt to decide or forecast, that the trikaldrishti is correct in all or most particulars. It is this uncertainty that is now being attacked; first, by distinguishing at the moment of its action the pseudo-trikaldrishti of volitional or creative perception, which may or may not be ful- filled, from the true trikaldrishti; secondly, by distinguishing the opposite or tamasic pseudo-trikaldrishti, overstressed perception of the possibilities of failure and adverse happening, which also may or may not occur, from the true trikaldrishti; thirdly, by the right arrangement of true perceptions so that their full sense may not be misinterpreted. Rupa in the Akasha developed in the dense and developed forms, but not yet with perfect freedom and abundance. Secondary utthapana took a considerable step forward, mahima & laghima immensely increasing except in the back and defect of anima greatly decreasing except in the back & neck. Kamananda continuous throughout the day, was less frequently intense and its ordinary level raised beyond the former limit, but inferior to yesterdays though more regular."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"218 Record of Yoga Jan 26 t . h . The difficulties of the new Turkish Cabinet in regard to the Powers promise not to be so acute as they might have been; as was felt by vyapti prakamya, there have been some ebullitions of anger & excitement, so that the Abdulla difficulty remains yet [unconquered]. 11 Every day gained is, at present, an advantage as the strength of the Aiswarya continually increases. After a temporary obscuration and struggle between prakasha and confusion lasting till teatime in the afternoon, the siddhi was finally cleared of the relics of the old tapas and of physical pressure. The aishwarya henceforth to be used is the spontaneous chinmay aishwarya free from all element of struggle, in which force and pressure will only be present to stress the energy of the fulfilment & not for overcoming resistance. Judgment in the intellect, a great obstacle to the range and freedom of the trikaldrishti, is also finally dismissed and the higher perception is allowed untrammelled play with the viveka for its assistant, not its judge. This movement was already in progress, but was prevented from universalising itself by the insistence of the old volitional tapas which demanded survival and justification. Kamananda, absent on rising, continuous but slight during the morning, recovered intensity in the afternoon. This intensity is persistently recurrent, rather than continuous, but its recurrence is spontaneous and forcible, no long er dependent on the attention, but commanding the attention. It persists even in swapna-samadhi and is found continuously persistent on waking from sleep. Only bodily activity curbs its intensity. Otherwise it yields to nothing except the bodily habit of intermittence. Rupa & lipi are struggling with the physical obstruction in the akasha for a larger fulfilment.

Trikaldrishti made a final stride forward to its ultimate per- fection by getting rid of the habit of tamasic denial which used to fasten on the least sign of amangala and asiddhi and hasten to accept adverse probability or even possibility as adverse certainty. In the place of this denial there is left a strong uncertainty chiefly with regard to those parts of the siddhi in which the sraddha has not yet been established by events, ie the saundarya and karmasiddhi. Aishwarya attained to perfection of detail and is now beginning to act automatically and without effort in its various fields, but is still resisted firmly in the karma in which there is a general attack on the siddhi which has been developing for some time past, as the opposition shifted more and more from the Yogasiddhi to the karmasiddhi, and is now at its height. The aishwarya has got rid of the remnants of tapasic stress and struggle which marred its perfection of method and has only to get rid of a remnant of tamasic anxiety & asraddha about its results. Vani, script etc are being more & more justified and whenever the trikaldrishti acts, it is justified and false trikaldrishti, ie misinterpretation of material, is being put in its proper place and turned into satyam. Therefore, the asraddha is being forced to its final collapse. Lipi is now free, vivid and spontaneous, but not always legible. Rupa has attained to activity in all kinds, but not yet free activity, & to more frequent stability in all but the developed perfect form; its force is daily increasing, but the progress is marked by the old gradual slowness & has not yet come into line with the new rapidity. Drishti of Samadhi & visvagati developed yesterday in force & stability, but has still an imperfect hold on the akasha. Kamananda has overcome all its difficulties, eg noncontinuity of intense ananda while walking etc, except the mere habit of intermission; this habit grew stronger yesterday, & there was much & frequent intermission. On the other hand the ananda pervades the system more perfectly & has not lost either in intensity or in ease of recurrence. It is growing more powerful in the raudra form. Arogya is increasing; strongly attacked yesterday, it overcame all difficulties except the weakness of the second chakra.

For this reason, jalavisrishti is still overfrequent and the demand of the Apana still continues. Secondary utthapana is progressing in strength of laghima and mahima and has begun to expel defect of anima into the outworks of the physical system, but this process is still in its initial stages. Only saundarya is slow to manifest; it does not yet succeed in getting rid of its positive contradictions, the signs of old age etc. The saundarya once in motion and the equipment to hand, the whole siddhi will be in simultaneous successful movement. Jan 28 th Nothing definite today in the telegrams, except the pressure on China. The struggle has been transferred now to its proper field and the full force of the adverse powers is in evidence to bring about the destruction of the karma. Today, according to promise, proofs of the action of Aishwar- ya-ishita-vyapti in the karmasiddhi are beginning to crowd in; incidentally, the trikaldrishti is being justified against the relics of tamasic hesitation at every step. Dream became perfect in type, though still imperfectly organised, on its way to conversion into memorative experience in samadhi. Rupa in swapnasamadhi is now much more stable, although continuous experience in vision and in the sukshmadeha, as distinguished from continuous dream experience & momentary experiences in the sukshmadeha, are still held back from manifestation. Secondary utthapana in the neck in- creased in mahima, (maintenance while counting 1000 deliberately is the test), but defect of anima is still strong here and it resists successfully, in the back, the extension of the utthapana.

In the arms in the primary position utthapana can easily be maintained for an"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 221 hour and, if necessary, for much longer. Arogya after a struggle gave proof of increasing force; there was the first real parthiva visrishti at the close of the seventh day, but even here the force of assimilation was proved by the absence of any serious reaction such as would have been inevitable a short while ago. Rupadrishti in the jagrat still progresses slowly & is perfect only in a few types, but its stability increases. Dasya finally shed the remnants of the tertiary stage, & the quaternary dasyabuddhi is now constant & invariable whenever there is any turning of the mind towards the nature of the ac- tion, whatever the action may be. The purnabrahmadrishti is also normalised &, whenever there is smarana, invariable, whatever the object. Along with this development, there is perfect objec- tive vishayananda even in the bibhatsa and jugupsita; the same perfection is establishing itself in the subjective vishaya, bibhatsa, apriya, amangala, & there are only a few defects. Kamananda fell to a minimum, but now persists under all circumstances and is not suspended at night, but is always there subject to the anusmarana. It is growing again in intensity, with the intention of maintaining intensity in the constancy. It still tends to diminish, though not disappear, while walking, and to become involved or implicit by distraction of attention. Jan 29 t . h . . ([Written] 30 th ) Trikaldrishti justified.

The whole vijnana is now organising itself on the basis of the Sat-Tapas & the progress of this movement has been the principal siddhi of the day. In addition Ananda, reaching a higher intensity late in the morning, maintained it till the evening, diminished only when walking. This is now the normal pitch of the Kamananda when it occurs, in a state of activity; at the lower pitch it remains in a state of rest. Jan 31st. The transition which has been for some time in process of accomplishment, completes itself today. Formerly life was regarded as a thing to be worked upon and worked out, by active mental will and bodily means, speech, writing, work etc. A thing written had to be composed. An intellectual difficulty had to be thought out, a conclusion fixed and edified. That which was undiscovered, had to be sought for by speculation, reasoning, experiment. That which was unattained, had to be constructed by labour, attempt, adaptation of means, careful manipulation of materials. The rem- nants of this way of seeing clung until now to the thought and action, but henceforth it is removed. Life is a great mass of ex- istence, Sat, moulding itself through its own Tapas. All that has to be done is for the Jiva, the knowledge centre of this existence, to sit fast in his city, navadware pure, & allow the infinite Tapas to manifest through him, accepting it, sanctioning it, (anumati), giving the command to fulfil it to his helping devatas, (ishwara), holding up the whole system & its w orking, (bharta), and watching & enjoying the results. The Tapas may be with knowledge & then the results will be perfectly in accordance with what is intended, for what is intended, will be what is known to the mind as the thing that has to be done or is to happen, kartavyam karma; if"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"1–31 January 1913 223 it is without knowledge or with imperfect knowledge, it will still be known as the thing which God intends the individual system to lay stress upon (tapyeta), therefore to be willed, and the result, whether in accordance with the Tapas, or adverse to it, chosen or not chosen (ishta, anishta, priya apriya), favourable or adverse (mangala, amangala,) success or failure, (siddhi asiddhi, jayajayau,) will be the unseen thing that all along had to be & towards which all tapas has been contributing, (adrishtam, bhavitavyam), therefore to be accepted with equality of mind and with equality of ananda. This must be the first principle of the new period of action. The second principle, which has also been long preparing, is the renunciation of nigraha or as it used to be called, tapasy ́ a. Not that the Tapas may not have to persist under difficulties, but no violence has to be done to the Prakriti. It has to work out its own defects. This is now possible, because of the growth of the supreme or quaternary dasya, by which the very thought & feeling comes only as things impelled by the divine hand of the Master & Sarathi. Absolute Samata & passivity are now possible. Therefore in action there will be no planning, only seeing of the way the thing to be done will develop under the shaping of the divine Tapas whether through myself or others; in writing no composition, only the record of the vak as it flows down from above and forms itself in the Sat of Mind; in Yoga no sadhan, but only the acceptance of the self-organising movements of the anandamaya vijnanamaya Prakriti as it progressively takes entire possession of this inferior mental & physical kingdom. Todays news are mostly confirmative of the trikaldrishti or aiswarya; the running down of a sailing-vessel, confirming yester- days perception; the rumour of the Karachi bomb-find proving to be a fact and not a newspaper invention, though probably a police fraud; the fresh demands and threats of Roumania; the falsity of the Vienna rumour; the Moorish resistance in Marrakesh; the Suffragette recrudescence. Only in the Turkish War the trikaldrishti has not worked well; for the imminent denunciation of the armistice reported from Vienna is contrary to what was expected, viz that the Allies would wait for the Turkish reply. It has to be seen, however, whether the report is correct."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"224 Record of Yoga Today has been a day of considerable advance. The script has recovered accuracy of detail and added to it accuracy of suggestion. All the predictions made for the day have been fulfilled not only in substance, but in detail and in order of time and circumstance. Intensity of ananda has been greatly increased and the more intense pitch is now established as the normal to which the Ananda tends always to rise when not hampered either by deliberate obstruction or by the tamasic sanskar of dharane asamarthya impressed on the karmadeha from the outside swabhava and through the karmadeha affective of the body; otherwise it sinks to the subnormal, the pitch attained yesterday, or even to the implicit when it seems to be discontinued or existing only as a general tendency. The health is being purified slowly of the remnants of cold and eruption and is almost free of both, though still subject to momentary touches; visrishti has been a little thrown back, the assimilation for the last three days being less powerful; but today, although subjected to an unusually powerful tejasic stimulus, it has resisted much better than ever before since the final stage began and was disturbed only partially & very temporarily. The weakness of the chakra has been greatly exaggerated, but tends always when allowed to return to the former state of passive efficiency, dhairya & dharana. Secondary utthapana also suffers from a partially successful attack & apparently successful obstruction. Samadhi took a great stride forward. It has begun to organise itself and images (visual, auditory, sensational, actional, tactual) came in a crowd, not yet well organised, but evolving their own or- ganisation. Continuity of incident accompanied with perfect vivid- ness was greater in one typical case than has yet happened and the tendency of image to survive into the antardarshi jagrat was strong and successful. Rupadrishti in the jagrat is at last emerging defini- tively out of the prison of the sukshma, but the movement is not yet complete. Trikaldrishti and aishwarya are becoming more effective in details of the siddhi. The subjective tamas which returned par- tially for a short time, has been rejected and the physical is being expelled.

The great feature of the siddhi now is that the objective alone resists, and there the resistance is artificially entertained, in some cases without any real basis, in others by taking exaggerated ad- vantage of old grooves in the Sat of matter or the vaja of forward acting mind. The movement of the siddhi in the immediate future must be in the totality of the seven chatusthayas. Not that all its members are equally developed, or that a separate stress on some of them is not still needed, but by the end of February this stress must have ceased and the whole must be united for the activities of life which are to replace the activities of the sadhana. Such siddhi as remains will grow by life and action and not by abhyasa in the ways of Yogic practice. The stress that is still necessary is due to the survival of the old elemental opposition which stands in the way of the siddhi being effectively expressed in life. This opposition is now a tamasic obstruction and will rapidly lose the little that it still keeps of the faculty of aggressive assault. Above all, the basis of samata is now perfect and once the medium of tejas is perfected, the instrument, vijnana, will equally liberate itself from the obstruction and no farther opposition can then prevail against the ananda and the karmasiddhi, the apas and the lila.

Sat or Substance is now everywhere vyakta, Tapas is in activity, Ananda emergent, Vijnana in process of organisation. The first day of February has been outwardly a day of retardation, almost of relapse; for the trikaldrishti once more lapsed into a state of murky obscurity shot with light and halflit with erring illuminations, misplaced energy worked more than satya tapas, the body was overtaken by exhaustion or weakness, Ananda failed in sustained intensity. As usual, however, the movement was one of preparation, not of relapse, for the expulsion of these remnants, not a concession to their extant force. The karmasiddhi which seemed to have been once more attacked, emerged perfectly victorious in the immediate surroundings. . Ss [Saurins] interview with the Governor showed that the prakamyavyapti & the aishwarya were acting correctly; the news of the troubles of the opposition movement were still more strikingly in accord with the Will. A failure in the recurring problem was immediately corrected by the Will. The lipi “safety of the S.C.” was justified. In other directions of the karma a motion is visible. Although therefore there was no addition or definite in- crease in the siddhi, the current of preparation was perfectly visible. In addition, the most powerful tests & attacks failed to disturb the samata & shanti which can now be considered as established.

The Telegrams today contain several fulfilments of the aish- warya & trikaldrishti 1. the appointment of Ijjat Pasha as Com- mander-in-Chief (lipi); 2. the passing of the Trades Unions Bill without Conservative opposition (aishwarya); 3. the loss of a boat and grounding of a ship, (lipi more shipwrecks), and the storm & railway accidents in Germany (trikaldrishti); 4. the Nationalist success at Londonderry; 5. the trend of opinion about the Turkish note in Europe. The morning began with an effective reorganisation of the trikaldrishti, but an unsuccessful attempt to bring in the strong and effective tejas & tapas disturbed the system, and brought back the unavailing struggle of false tapas to harmonise itself with knowledge & peace; the result was a return of the contradiction of samata, shanti, sukha & prasada, which although unable to possess the system, was able to overcome its outer activity by re- current touches giving an impression of continuity. As usual, the contrariety started with impatience of asiddhi and was enforced by impatience of asatya. The result of the struggle has been to establish the satya tapas in knowledge; formerly, perfect trikaldrishti was only possible on condition of entire passivity, of a purely inert re- ception of true suggestions confirmed by the event or sanctioned by the illumination. The movement to introduce an active knowledge has hitherto had a chequered success and, if pushed too far, led always to false tapas and disturbance of truth and peace; but now the active knowledge has asserted its right to conjoint action with passive perception of the data. The elements of a well-organised trikaldrishti are, therefore, all of them present and the organisation will now be finally proceeded with and effected. In this organisation all the elements of error, which have so long troubled the intellect and the faith, will find their justification, for all of them are now revealed as essentially true processes of knowledge which only lead to error because their results are misunderstood by the stumbling and groping faculty of discrimination dignified with the name of"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"230 Record of Yoga reason. The tamasic trikaldrishti, the tejasic volitional, the specu- lative, the inferential have all their place and portion in intuitive and revelatory knowledge. At the same time satya tapas is being finally established, not in the sense of being finally effective, but in the sense of being either (1) immediately effective or (2) ultimately effective or (3) effective of a force or tendency intended ultimately to modify the present type of action or nature. Thus the sense of failure, error and misuse of energy which used to discourage the Chandibhava and bring back the merely calm or the discouraged passivity, now disappears in its causes and the basic elements of the bhava may be considered well-established, ie ́ sauryam ugrata and yuddhalipsa and even daya ishwarabhavah karmasamarthyam, although not perfect & all-embracing are at least in established action. The sraddha alone is still deficient and liable, even in some of its efficient parts, to be discouraged. A fresh siddhi today is the finality of the Krishna-Kali relation in the personality; the personal activity of the Purushottam; the per- sonal script; the personal vani; the personal guidance. The period of intermittent manifestation of guidance passed some time ago, its remnants are now deleted; only the remnants of the indirect guidance remain and these too are to be rapidly deleted, for the indirect guidance itself ceases from today. It has long been only a subordinate part of the guiding activity, always tending to be overruled or dominated in its suggestions, impulses and utterances.

In the kamananda a double sanyama is developing &, indeed, already active by which a part of the manas activity has detached itself to attend to the sensation of the ananda while the main energy is otherwise concerned. By this movement, which has yet to be perfected, the ananda has been enabled not only to possess, but to become sovereign of the body in both the states of physical activity and of mental abstraction; once this sovereignty is well established and emphasised, only the states of sleep and samadhi remain to be mastered. The state of samadhi is already open to the ananda, but its entrance there is still exceptional. (Feb 3) In accordance with the programme Ananda has taken sov- ereign possession of all states and has been continuous yesterday from the morning when it commenced, throughout the day, pre- vailed over several attempts to expel it in the evening, the time when it has usually declined, persisted throughout the night every time that the sleep was interrupted, recurred & held the body constantly in moments of samadhi and was often present in sleep. The only defect of the continuity was interruption by sleep and unevenness, failure of continuous intensity; for twice in the evening it became almost implicit and in sleep it became involved in apparent cessa- tion. Rupa and lipi were both active, & rupa commenced extending its range of stable developed images; the greatest progress, how- ever, was in samadhi which finally triumphed and produced great, complex and continuous images and incidents in profusion, taking possession of dream, which is now passing into swapna-samadhi. Present association hardly occurred at all in a crowded succession of dreams and even present ego, though not entirely absent, be- came a practically negligible quantity. Only a slight tendency to inconstancy and rapid transition, not amounting to incoherency, marred this rapidly effected perfection. For the first time, the vision of the book with freely legible passages and sentences, became frequent and, if not yet fixedly stable, yet sufficiently stable in its rapid self-revelation for whole sentences & even several sentences at a time to be simultaneously read and understood.

Todays first movement has been the development of the au- thoritative direct guidance of the Master of the Yoga imposing itself on the mind even when there are no data for sraddha and, parallel with this movement, a strengthening of the pure revelatory movement, independent of data, probability or actual fulfilment, of the trikaldrishti and its materials, lipi, prakamya-vyapti and rupa. The purnabrahmadrishti has also been powerfully strength- ened and is extruding the old outlook of mere Avidya. Otherwise the morning has been occupied chiefly with the removal of the remnants of certain old activities, eg, expectation, mental insistence, distrust etc. The process is not yet complete. The rest of the day was occupied with action on the same lines and the removal of expectation & mental insistence was thoroughly tested; the latter has disappeared and is replaced by dhriti and tejas; expectation is inactive, but is not replaced yet by a settled faith, owing to the apparent contradiction given by events to some statements of the Vani which has revived the tendency of distrust. This distrust, however, can only hold its own in details and recur as a doubt with regard to saundarya and Adeshasiddhi. It does not any longer question the Yogasiddhi, but is only doubtful about its immediate incidents or its promised increase of rapidity.

The second chatusthaya is now being arranged by the harmony of the dasya, tejas and general sraddha, (tapas, tejas, prakasha), but the uncertainty of the trikaldrishti continues and prevents assured sraddha in details of time, place & circumstance. Strong persistence of fever, mainly in the sukshmadeha, but with fluctuating effects on the sthula, was the principal feature of the day.

Sraddha in the eventual Yoga- siddhi has remained substantially unaffected, in spite of shadows, except that strong doubts have assailed the faith in the saundarya, the one member of the four chatusthayas for which there is as yet very meagre justification. On the other hand the Mahakali tapas has sunk into inactivity, after one strong battle in which it pre- vailed temporarily over the strongest resistance to the aishwarya.

In the afternoon exceeding[ly] brilliant swapnasamadhi at a great depth of dream-trance repeatedly occurred; the rupas were of the fleeting kind, but stable for two or three seconds, instead of, as usual, fleeting in the moment of appearance. At night also swapna- samadhi was rich and various at a great depth and perfectly stable scenes of entire vividness were at last developed, instead of the vivid stability of shifting panorama and dim stability which were formerly the highest attainment. The fleeting still predominates over the stable, the dim or pale over the vivid; but the disproportion is decreasing. Organisation, also, has not progressed and dream is once more imperfectly coherent. Kamananda recovered intensity and confirmed the permanent stability of the subdued ananda. From today the intensity has be- come as natural and sustained in standing and walking as in the sitting and recumbent positions and is hardly less in pitch; but the abstraction of the attention has still the power of suspending the intense ananda. The movement now is to a greater continuity of the intense ananda. Trikaldrishti grows in normal perfection of detail; but the other siddhis are still busy confirming their hold on the akash.

All that has happened in the last few days confirms the view then taken; the stage is one of partial and combated efficiency. Yet there are proofs of advance. Eg On the 8 th night a swelling on the ankle & foot began, in the morning the whole of the left foot was attacked & it did not seem as if a speedy cure were possible. It was, however, indicated in the thought that it was merely an effect of impure rasa and not the disease common in these parts, 2 would show no 2 Filariasis (elephantiasis), endemic in Pondicherry.

This prediction was fulfilled to the letter. Moreover, the swelling healed exactly as the will was applied, the part most insisted on improving first, the others more slowly. The great difficulty is the resistance in the physical akasha, first to the effective activity and, secondly, to the unmixed activity of the vijnana. If the mixture of the old intellectual activity can be got rid of, the effective vijnanamaya activity can be assured more rapidly. It is towards this end that the Power is now work- ing. The immediate ends proposed are Brahman, Ananda external and internal, Arogya, effective Image in waking state & sleep and effective Trikaldrishti. The whole activity of the Yoga is being re- constituted. The rupas of all kinds appear though fitfully & with insufficient stability & frequency, in the waking state, & insufficient stability & continuity in sleep. The Brahmadrishti is now complete & less frequently forgotten & never lost. Kamananda, which had almost faded out, is reviving. The resistance in all directions still continues. [ Here all but two lines of a page left blank. ] 19th May 1913. The stable progress of the siddhi has been now established against the backward and downward tendencies; effects long pro- duced fragmentarily and [in]securely are now firm and inalterable. Rapidity supervenes on the stability, but freedom from attack, superiority to resistance has yet to be effected. The third or vijnana-chatusthaya has now been well planted in the soil of the lower kingdoms of the being. Their contradictions have still to be excluded, their defects corrected, their force strength- ened and their range extended. The fourth or physical siddhi, long the subject of serious doubt, is now commenced in all its parts and in some of them appears to be firmly rooted. The third can now be left to develop; the fourth and fifth alone still present serious difficulties, admit of prolonged & sometimes effective resistance and demand some struggle."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"April and May 1913 243 Suggestions. Today is the last day of the negative movements; from tomor- row pure progress commences. That change has to be prepared & completed this afternoon and evening. [ Here a quarter of a page left blank. ] 21 st May. As is not unusual when a suggestion of strong and swift progress is made, the fulfilment, at first apparently complete, is interrupted by as powerful an opposite movement of non-fulfilment as the state of the siddhi will permit. The principle of pure progress is the perception of the end which all apparently adverse circum- stances are intended to serve and the immediate conversion of the negative into a positive movement. Successfully established till 3 pm yesterday, it was then suddenly reversed and a negative move- ment induced of an obstinacy and completeness such as has been absent from the siddhi since last March.. The object of the reverse was to get rid of the remnants of tejasic suggestion (asha, desire, over-stress, effort,) which still persist in the mental environment. All the vijnana siddhis are now permanently active and effec- tive, but with defects and limitations & subject to the continued mental activity of mixed truth & falsehood which is still successfully maintained in the mental environment by the opposing tendencies of Prakriti and successfully thrust upon the mind in the form of suggestions. The rupa & samadhi formerly deficient have now a petty but sufficient regular fertility, which can be rapidly enlarged & eventually perfected. They still lack some of their old felicities, but when these return, they will no longer be fitful, uncertainly held & willed as formerly, but natural, spontaneous and a permanent pos- session. The rupas are principally embarrassed by the persistence of a few dominant images which shut out the others or replace them when they attempt to manifest. Another difficulty is the resistance obstinately offered to the emergence from the prana akasha of the perfect, as distinguished from the representative images. In the physical siddhi, Ananda is the most advanced. The vishayanandas of the senses are all perfected in type, seldom"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"244 Record of Yoga contradicted, but as yet insufficient in intensity, except in the taste, where even it is uneven. The higher mental anandas are all present (prema, chidghana, shuddha), but as yet imperfectly active. Ahaituka ananda is constant in shanti, but not yet in active santosha. The sahaituka sharira anandas are established and grow- ing; the ahaituka manifest but infrequent. Ahaituka kamananda is alone well-established, and awakes whenever recalled, but is still too much a matter of the will and not a self-acting dharma of the body. It can manifest now in any state, jagrat or samadhistha. Thirst has almost disappeared, though it made an appearance for two or three days, mostly in a suppressed form; but does not now occur even in the unusual heat of this summer. Hunger makes its appearance fitfully and is never intense & seldom prolonged; it is being rapidly replaced by hungerless bhojan ́ ananda. Heat & cold are still slightly effective on the body. Pain has turned into some form of ananda except in extreme touches, eg burning by fire, blows touching the bone, etc; but here it is only the immediate contact that is painful, the after effect is always anandamaya; in some touches, eg mosquito bite the habit of discomfort still continues, but is now occasional and not a dharma of the body. Pain of events is the one asamata of mind still persisting & then only as asamata of failure; this too is occasional, largely artificial and no longer a dharma of the mind. Arogya is troubled now only by the vicissitudes of the visrishti- visarjana which have much diminished and by the inefficiency of vajra. The solid visrishti takes place now irregularly after five days or three or more than five; it was preceded & is still accompanied or followed usually by some action of excessive tejas in the jala bhuta; but this is rapidly diminishing. Occasional trouble of vayavya or taijasa jala has been frequent, but seems now to be moving towards elimination. Jalavisrishti showed recently a tendency towards rapid diminution & even disappearance; at present it is again restored, but has no longer its former force and abundance.

The body is still subject to touches of asamata, to physical disturbance and discomfort and to bodily depression but these rem- nants of asiddhi are in process of elimination. Subjectively, all that remains are occasional touches on the physical prana which more & more are rendered in terms of physical pressure, not mental, & even this pressure is being steadily converted into a physical ananda which replaces the old discomfort and nirananda, mental & bodily, of grief, vexation, revolt, defeat, failure etc. 2.

The fourfold dharma of virya is at work, subject to ineffective physical touches of their opposites, but not yet energetically active. With the same qualification the fourfold state of shakti is well established, but still uncertain in the bodily force.

The minor rogas (cold etc) which are being expelled still appear momentarily or in isolated touches as external intrusions appearing with or without provocation. Exposure to cold is still effective in assisting this kind of uneasiness. The Kali consciousness aware of Krishna as the Iswara attached itself to all the acts & experiences; but the Krishna personality was held back & the anna given over to other influences. This last movement was the result of the attempt to execute with force of tejas a second programme, the attempt going through the usual stages. A violent attack of asiddhi, bringing confusion & sunlessness to all the vijnana siddhis & general nirananda of impatience & asraddha, occupied the outer parts of the system. The first chatusthaya remained constant in the system proper, but the physical parts of mind res ponded to strong though unstable & unpoignant touches of doubt, depression of faith, impatience of asatya &, to a less degree, of asiddhi.

The element of tapasya is now much reduced, but still persists in the physical siddhi. For the most part all action is now a passivity supporting more or less effective tapas, not tapasya. In Samadhi coherent sentences of lipi are now common, but in the mass the lipi is incoherent. Isolated figures or momentary groups still prevail. Antardrishta jagrat is confined to the most elementary crude forms and even these come with difficulty and rarely; antardrishta speedily passes into sushupta or swapna samadhi. July 6 th .

As the result of the days programme an extensive & minute trikaldrishti defective only in a slight uncertainty, occasional mis- placements and errors of detail and a tendency to fatigue, when the tamasic or sunless movement tries to resume its hold, is definitely achieved. Telepathy (prakamya vyapti of thought) is now begin- ning to advance towards self-regularisation & a freer movement & range. The difficulty is only in recognising the thought when it is seen; for it is usually taken as an idea in ones own mind and not recognised as the thought of another, owing to our egoistic appropriation of whatever comes to us in our subjective experience. This difficulty once surmounted, aprakasha alone will remain to be overcome, itself due to egoistic limitation of our subjective experience & attention to so much as interests or can be made useful to our own activity; an infinite openness & the ear of the mind alert for all shabda is required in order that these siddhis may be perfected."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"280 Record of Yoga Aishwarya increases considerably & rapidly in force & effec- tiveness, no longer in the old field of exercise mainly (movements of birds, beasts, insects, people around) but in the wider range of life.

They occur in it from time to time, sometimes baffled, but no longer rebuked. (2) Ananda overcomes the obstacle to continuity and then to intense continuity. Ananda (sharira) was active throughout the day, continuous in spite of asmarana due to distraction of attention or absorption in thought or act, mildly intense sometimes, but towards the end of the day uncertain, interrupted and, finally, during the night, quiescent (3) The lacunae of knowledge begin to be filled up, the basis being already formed. The improvement was chiefly in the more ordinary and spon- taneous action of telepathy of idea, right perception of unseen fact, memory, sahityasmriti, acceptance of distant trikaldrishtis, etc. Scenes & incidents forgotten for decades begin to recur to the memory, isolated, not usually complete, but in the details restored quite vivid and precise. (4) The arogya gets the better of its remaining difficulties. There was constant proof of the power of the arogya, when"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"282 Record of Yoga touched or attacked, to resist the attack and right itself swiftly after even strong touches. But the movement is as yet only in its initial stage of decisiveness, not yet wholly decisive. (5) The lipi in its tertiary stage begins to take possession of the akasha. The tertiary stage has as its features, fixity, immediate leg- ibility, spontaneity of long lipis, variety & lipikaushalya in forms, colours etc. The movement is still embryonic. A beginning in the predominance of aishwarya was subse- quently predicted and took the shape of prayogas initially suc- cessful, then successfully baffled by opposing forces of habitual resistance, then fulfilled by unexpected circumstances suddenly in- tervening & showing the direct hand of the Ishwara. Samadhi was once more active, but has not recovered normal coherency or long continuity of action. Sleep resumed its force, bringing one hour of nidravishta samadhi in the afternoon and more than seven hours sleep at night. Saundarya generally is forcefully obstructed & makes no progress; but in one detail there has been unexpected and rapid progress, a rounding off of the sharp angles of those fingers which were formerly square. This was noticed two or three days ago, but farther progress was sensible even in the course of a single day. In only two or three of the fingers are there still traces of the old sharp angles. This isolated rapidity is a strong contrast to the occasional slow & slight progress covering many months & the usual failure of all success in other attempts of the psychic body to alter by mental force the physical sheath into its own image.

For a time the power and the knowledge both seemed to have retrograded & the first to be almost annulled; in the evening aish- warya reemerged with an increased force and effectiveness, fulfilling with an unprecedented frequency & persistence.

In the night quiescence is still the rule, but is varied by strong touches of activity. (3) Lacunae of knowledge fill more completely. Only a slight movement took place in this direction. (4) Lipi takes stronger possession. Formerly the ordinary rule of the lipi was the single word with occasional brief phrases & rare extensions, the rule is now the word or the brief phrase with a tendency to complete sentences. But the legibility, vividness & spontaneity are still combated and restricted by the obstinate resistance of the material akasha. (5) Arogya yet stronger. It resisted with general success, but not entire immunity, the conditions which have in the past usually or invariably provoked a retrograde movement. (6) Obstacles to enthusiasm of faith & tejas remove[d]. The chief obstacle removed was dependence on favourable result & success; but the tendency to temporary depression of force from subjective causes is not yet altogether eliminated. (7) Samadhi & rupa active. Rupa (crude) was only briefly active in a few images, but these evinced a perfection and stability in various circumstances (image on background, crude image, group, developed image) not yet so decisively combined. Samadhi recovered coherency & is developing application to life. (eg Alpt carrying a cane chair through a veranda; Bh. [Bharati] offering to Rg & another some food, three glasses on a table & pieces of cocoanut (?)). (8) Utthapana. Utthapana of the arm in the horizontal position was enforced for an hour and a half; during the later part of this period an abnormal stiffness was produced and an artificial pressure from above strove to depress the arm; nevertheless after three minutes rest, it could again be continued, but in recumbent posture, for another half hour. A slight stiffness in the shoulder is the only after result. Typical utthapana of leg & neck were effected for half an hour, in order to get rid of the habit of adhogati which had again reasserted itself. The physical depression still continues."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"284 Record of Yoga (9) Saundarya. No definite forward movement as yet distinguishable.

Owing to the rush of the old inferior movements which used to rise whenever the avegamaya sraddha & tapas manifested, the trikaldrishti was clouded & dis- turbed, & the old tejasic misinterpretations abounded. But there was no disturbance, revolt or nirananda in the system & only the shadow of the old tamasic reaction. July 9 th . The programme for the next three days is yesterdays with additions. The utthapana and saundarya especially must move for- ward. Trikaldrishti has already reasserted itself, but is imperfect in circumstance; this imperfection will now disappear. Aishwarya is inconstant in its action & often effective only against resistance; the action must be regular & the effectiveness spontaneous. Lipi must get a complete hold on the akash and the difficulty of the stability in rupa, especially in lifelike rupa must at last disappear.

The saun- darya has broken down or gone back in the parts not irrevocably fixed & the violent return of asaundarya is successful everywhere. Aishwarya is not entirely ineffective, but subject to frequent fail- ure & almost universal resistance. The touches of roga returned where they were on the point of evanescence and there has been some diminution in the force of continuity of the kamananda. The promises of finality held out to the mind in the first & second chatusthayas, as well as in some details of the third & fourth, have proved, as always, to be tejasic and deceptive. On the other side, there has been enforced a more general perception of the unity of all movements of the Prakriti and of the unity of the mover of the Prakriti & their unity also with the same Purusha & Prakriti in this adhara. The Jiva also is made to recognise its unity with the Prakriti, but not yet with the Purusha, except in occasional glimpses. The rounding of the fingers still progresses; the only definite trace of the sharp angles is in one corner of the third finger of the left hand where it is represented by a horn of dried & callous skin empty of flesh; otherwise they appear only in the excessive fullness of the curves or in slight unevennesses representing the lost angle (especially on one side of the right thumb). This fullness appears in all except the first fingers which were always pointed & the lefthand little finger which is now of the full pointed variety to which the righthand little finger has also progressed more than others. No other decisive improvement is noticeable in the saundarya, although there is a similar tendency in the feet. Samadhi is more vigorous & dream recovering continuous coherence, but the movement of samadhi towards long continuity of single incident is not yet effective.

In accordance with the prediction the movement of the vijnana from action in the slight, petty & detailed to action in the satyam, ritam, brihat was commenced. At first the knowledge was merely brihat in manas, hundreds of perceptions coming without order or right direction; then the satyam in this infinity came to be revealed not the ritam; every perception was found to be true, but not always true at the time & in the place & order of circumstance indicated by the mind. Subsequently the ritam commenced, the trikaldrishti occurring with perfect accuracy even in the mental & sunless per- ceptions, but before it could be completed, other preoccupations commenced which filled the rest of the day (kriti).

[ writteninpencil ] The rest of yesterday evening passed in a return to a for- mer mental condition, with a background of udasina ananda held against touches of disquiet, an imperfect & clouded knowledge, an ineffective or only partially and slowly effective will, a poor & struggling lipi & rupa, an unprogressive & infrequent samadhi. The dasyabuddhi of the body, strong in the afternoon, was covered at night. September 5. [ writteninink ] In the evening and night the remnants of the days struggle and retrogression prevented progress. The mental suggestions still continued to be shot in from a distance and especially suggestions of unfaith, weariness and nirananda. All the powers of the vij- nana were clouded and partially inoperative, the strong physical dasyabuddhi of the afternoon partially covered, kamananda declin- ing and less frequent. The system reverted to the udasina ahaituka ananda of former times continually assailed by touches of strong & often angry disquiet. This is the first determined relapse into old conditions after many months of essential freedom from any true disturbance of the samata-shanti-sukham. This morning opens with the same conditions. It appears that for the first time in these few months a lower strain of the physical mind in the external swabhava yet surcharged with the anritam & avidya has been upheaved and its devatas let loose on the adhara. The trikaldrishti labours for correctness of minute circum- stance & unvarying correctness of actual result, but does not as yet go beyond amplitude of prakamya vyapti with frequency of the actual result and occasional correctness of minute circumstance. There is still the predominance of the perception of working mental forces in which the result intended & perceived is sometimes carried"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"288 Record of Yoga out, sometimes crossed by a successful counter-force, and often a result not intended, a force never meant to prevail, is foisted on the mind as the prearranged actuality. The latter result is especially frequent because the physical stratum upheaved is one inhabited by blind mechanical movements of the involved & unexpressed mind in matter which correspond in Nature to the subconscious physical stirrings in us of which our conscious mind takes no least cognizance in its normal & organised workings. Disregarded & unrecognised they pass without visible effect, although they must have some determining force & contribute to some result however slight of whose preparation we are unaware. There has been no distinct advance in the daytime. The physical ananda persists when it is remembered or in the stillnesses of the body, but tends, as formerly, to retire in motion or when forgot- ten by the mental attention. Its intensity is rare and not extreme. Trikaladrishti is still haunted & baffled by blind and purposeless false suggestions proceeding & entering from some external point in a far distance; power is uncertain in its effect and always hampered. Lipi & rupa do not take hold of the akasha. Health is successfully resisted. Utthapana though growing is assailed by vague adhogati and an acute uneasiness of [ ] 1 negative electricity which brings about or is attended by pains of contraction. The laghima alone is strong & keeps the limb in the air without any mental will or muscular effort. Saundarya makes no apparent advance. There are constant tejasic suggestions of immediate progress, but the Jiva refuses to lend credit to them. The dasya, however, in- stead of being hampered seems to grow by this struggle; the merely Prakritic forces diminish in their hold on the system. Ashanti has attempted to be acute at times, but has not succeeded in fastening on the system. In the evening lipi & rupa showed some signs of strengthening and the other siddhis attempted to liberate themselves, but nothing very definite has yet been accomplished. Some literary work was well accomplished. Dasya always increases. 1 MS of"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"5–21 September 1913 289 Sept 6. Instances of sukshma touch & smell increased yesterday and also of physical ananda; the touch of a fly on the palm of the hand creating a thrill of combined vishaya, tivra, vaidyuta & raudra which continued for more than a minute though not with entire continuity. Today the kamananda is more continuous, but not in- tense. Assimilation has strongly retrograded. Power manifests, but can be sustained only by the exertion of great force which tires the physical fibres and is always strongly resisted. Trikaldrishti is still baffled by the mental suggestions; it occurs frequently, but is in the highest degree uncertain and inconstant. The suggestion has been made in the vani that purports to pro- ceed from the master of the yoga for the consciousness is crowded with many voices that confuse the mind to proceed on the basis of positive affirmation and discovery of the precise truth & error in each suggestion and of positive faith in the march of the siddhi regardless of temporary failure & anritam. At first the trikaldrishti reemerged, only without the exactitude of detail, the actual event anticipated with omission of an intervening event or with denial of the coming event after it had been perceived instead of modification by the addition of the omitted circumstance or stress on intention as event; but for a time every perception was eventually justified by some result and later after a period of confusion, the old realisation, by which perception was shown to be the reflection in mind of a truth of tendency, intention or event & the nature of the truth shown & proved by some actual material movement, returned as the type of the siddhi. Beyond this point the siddhi of knowledge seems to be unable to advance except for brief occasional periods of a few minutes when absolute accuracy of event is temporarily effected. Willpower after proving eventually successful in all or almost all cases for a time is once more uncertain & chequered. There is the old tendency to a chaotic advance of mixed success & failure, imperfect & overstressed truth, unsatisfying siddhi. As it progresses correctness of knowledge & effectiveness of will tend to predominate over their opposites. It is not yet certain that this progress will become a fixed and uninterrupted tendency or produce results which will not be broken & need to be reconstituted. The"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"290 Record of Yoga Atris & Vrikas are still strong in the sadhana, even stronger than the Vritras & no siddhi is safe from them although all tend to recover themselves once the evil period is passed. The siddhi reconstituted itself more strongly during the evening and night. Subjective ananda, including in itself defeat, imperfection & suffering, which has been baffled always when it attempted these inclusions, was more finally prepared. Rupadrishti became strong in the waking Chidakash & Chittakash. Knowledge & power re- sumed more successfully their process of selftransference into the vijnana. Sept 7. The morning began with a chequered movement. Afterwards, there came the lipi “First God & liberty, then telepathy.” The mind turned towards the perception of the Jnanam Anandam Brahma which has been increasing in force & persistence & perceived very powerfully the delight of Brahman in Avidya, limitation & suffering & the last knot of attachment to liberation was removed from the buddhi & the temperament. This liberation from mumukshutwa is the final step in mukti. It exists now in the buddhi & the soul, it has to be stamped firmly on the rest of the antahkaran. Afterwards, a very minute & brihat telepathy commenced the realisation in practical mentality of the Sarvam Anantam Jnanam Brahma. All the perceptions do not yet come at the right time, some revealing themselves after the thing perceived has passed out of the mind of the object. Nevertheless the movements of men & animals are now perfectly understood, their hesitations & rejected or modified ideas & impulses as well as those which eventuate in action. It is evident, now, out of what a complex mental tangle the single clear & decisive act proceeds. In the animals it is sometimes an obscure & sudden suggestion which contradicts all the previous thinking & tendency & often half consciously forces the action. But often also in them an impulse abandoned and forgotten by the mind remains in & dominates the subconscious pranic energy and dominates a subsequent action. The same is true but in a less degree of man. In the insects the mind counts for much less than this pranic energy. Subsequently the basis of the telepathic trikaldrishti"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"5–21 September 1913 291 was shown to reside in the perception of the movements of this pranic energy, Matariswan, which governs action, apo Matarisw ́ a dadhati. An ant was climbing up the wall in an upward stream of ants; there was no sign of its reversing its progress; but the trikaldrishti saw that the ant would turn & go down, not upwards. At first it made a movement of uncertainty, then proceeded up- ward, then suddenly left the stream and went steadily & swiftly downwards. Afterwards the source of the trikaldrishti was seen, a coming movement of pranic energy, prepared in the sat-Brahman, latent both to the waking consciousness of the ant & my own, but caught by the vijnanamaya drishti. In another instance the same movement of energy was perceived in another ant and followed by an indicative movement, but it was also perceived that this was not the eventual impulse, & as a matter of fact a strong contrary tension intervened & carried the insect upward. In all these cases, the perception of the impulse by prakamya vyapti is not enough; the vijnana distinguishing the nature & fate of the tapas is required to constitute trikaldrishti. All error now consists in the absence of this distinguishing perception or in the false mental stress which tends to replace its unerring accuracy. Sept 13 During the last week a considerable quantity of ground has been covered. Ordinarily the condition of the system is a state of positive samata, sama ananda in all that occurs or is expe- rienced, but there is still a tendency to asamata in the face of persistent bad result in Yoga accompanied by untruth in what seem to be the centres of knowledge. Usually the tendency only touches the system from outside and is repelled by the samata, but sometimes it actualises into a more or less prolonged state of unfaith, despondency and disquiet. The second chatusthaya has progressed greatly. Secondary dasya has given place to the first stage of tertiary; tejas & tapas have now become habitually ac- tive when the prakasha is clouded by the partial nirananda & unfaith; the bhava of Mahakali on the Maheshwari pratistha has occupied permanently the Mahasaraswati continent without this time ploughing up the pratistha & continent by the tendency to drag"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"292 Record of Yoga them also over to the rudrabhava. Faith is now almost complete & grows in intensity; but it is still troubled by too much subservience to the immediate actualities & cannot always look beyond to the future actuality. Nevertheless the habit of perceiving the truth in every perception, the force of fulfilment in every action or baulking of action & the ananda in every sensation of heart & mind is growing even upon the intellect. The chief movement has been the development of the ideality, its increasing hold on the rebellious & self-acting intellectuality in the outer swabhava and the transfer of the mental activity to the ideal plane. Telepathy has increased to a considerable extent and embraces now the thoughts also, but is not always evenly active; in the use of the trikaldrishti it has become something of a stumbling block, as the rapid perception of the movements of impelling force, intention & impulse impresses the still active intellectual devatas with a false idea of actual result and tend[s] to shut out the event from the perception. Nevertheless the vijnanamay determination of the actual event even in detail begins to be more frequently reflected in the intellectual parts and has some force but, usually, little or no jyotirmaya prakasha. Power varies, but has grown in insistence, success & grip on the akasha. Vani & script are still excessive in statement, but the inert element tends to pass out of them. Lipi is now well-established in activity; but is more usually perfect in chitra & sthapatya than in akasha where the old faults of paleness, insufficient legibility & fragmentary manifestation are still powerful. Incoherence has not yet been removed, but the power to interpret lipi, coherent or incoherent, has grown immensely & is only faulty, as a rule, when the vijnana is clouded by the aprakasha & the intellect once more active. Rupa grows more fertile & is once more rich & perfect or almost perfect in chitra & sthapatya, (one defect is excess of human figures & defect of animal forms & objects), but in akasha it cannot yet compass the union of vivid clearness & stability. The obstruction here is still strong. Samadhi has increased in habitual coherence & continuity; even the lipi in sushupta swapna now tends to be coherent. The physical siddhi is always resisted & put back in utthapana & saundarya; in ananda & arogya it is progressive with occasional"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"5–21 September 1913 293 retrocessions. Habituality of kamananda and frequency of the other physical anandas has considerably increased; also to a certain extent their intensity. A serious effort is being made to get rid of the obsti- nate fragments of eruption, headache, cold & stomach complaint which still recur needlessly in the system. Headache usually occurs only by vyapti from other adharas. One great result of the weeks progress has been the completion & permanent possession in perception of the fourfold Brahman. The only defect is a tendency to fall back from the jnanam element, thereby losing the lilamaya personality of the Brahman. Otherwise vismriti is now only an inert & ineffective suspension of the siddhi, which has no longer to be reconstituted on resumption of the minds apramattata. Intellectual work is now almost finally based, except for some defects in the poetical power, and all the various work fixed on is being pursued; but the regularity of brain-work on one subject & the simultaneity of brain work on different subjects is very deficient owing to the insubmission or incapacity of the physical brain. The former defect is being rapidly remedied. The force of kriti has a little increased, perceptibly in effectiveness. Later in the day deeper perceptions of the vijnana were awak- ened, resulting in some remarkable effects of trikaldrishti; but these were afterwards confused by the invasion of external intellectual suggestions confusing, by falsity of stress, the ritam & the anritam. Nevertheless the faith in the vijnana perceptions not immediately justified by the physical actualities grows in force and persistence. The power of the aishwarya over immediate results in the body increases; but is still deficient in the rapidity of final results, though more effective than of old. Sept 14 t . h .

Lipi, rupa & samadhi continued steadily to gain in habitual force; but in the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"294 Record of Yoga latter two the akasha is not yet clarified of the main obstruction. Trikaldrishti is habitually correct even in rough detail & often in exact detail, but with an element of erroneous & perverting stress on the telepathic impressions and considerable gaps and lacunae. Utthapana somewhat weakly recommenced in arms, neck and legs. The struggle, successful on the whole, still continues with the rem- nants of the old slighter ailments, eruption & cold. The former has no tejas & there is usually the eruption without the irritation. The latter is losing tejas, but is persistent. Roga of the assimilation has still an occasional force as in the morning. In the saundarya the lower range teeth have retained their whiteness, only slightly stained at first with a shadow of yellow, for five days, (formerly one day could hardly be registered,) and the upper are getting clarified to an extent not yet experienced since the reaction began or even before it. There is as yet no sign of reaction. In other directions the reaction holds or allows only a slow and doubtful progress in one or two details. Sahitya steadily continues, but only in short flows of energy. Sept 16 th On the 14th there was a combination of successful aishwarya with strong & obstinate resistance to the aishwarya; this morning it succeeded almost in 100 per cent of the cases of application, &, what is quite a new feature, usually with instantaneous effect or else very rapidly after a slight and halfhearted resistance. Only in one case, the object, though obeying in minor details & long prevented from following its dominant impulse, obstinately & successfully resisted for many minutes the main command and finally executed an opposite movement. The other principal movements were in lipi and samadhi. In lipi the various stages through which the etheric script has wavered backwards & forwards, indistinctness or paleness of script, illegi- bility, partial legibility, vividness of single words, vividness of short phrases, unspontaneity, partial spontaneity, incoherent richness, il- legible vividness, legible vividness, etc have been passed through rapidly in a final movement and lipi is now fixed in the akasha as an abundant phenomenon both in the single word & the short"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"5–21 September 1913 295 phrase, spontaneous, vivid, legible, simultaneous, authoritative, and is now extending to long phrases. The interpretation of lipi is still occasionally hesitating owing to the uncertainties of the trikaldrishti, but this hesitation has disappeared from the thought scripts. The full authority of the thought is necessary to the full authority of the lipi. Rupa has developed a final richness, variety, frequency & perfect grouping in all the chitra & sthapatya forms including the vision in transparent substances; it has developed occasional perfection in single crude forms of all kinds & even in ghana, but is vague & indistinct in grouped images, & vivid but momentary in the lifelike developed or dense images. These are old difficulties. Samadhi last night attained again & more powerfully on the whole to richness, variety, grouping, vividness, continued action, shabda; but the continuity has to be swift and is limited to a very few successive movements owing to want of firm hold on the jagrat-swapna & jagrat-sushupta conditions. Only in dream is there long continuity; & dream is now, so far as remembered, usually connected & coherent, with only slight survivals of the old defects. Its images are more vivid & nearer to the forms of samadhi, but are still dream images. As yet they are not dreams of actuality, but scenes from past lives, sukshma experiences etc. The dreaminess has not departed out of them. All the subjective anandas, especially prema & next to it shud- dha have been finally fixed in the system; none of them are yet new in form, experience or intensity, but a tendency to greater gen- erality of intense experience is visible. The perception of ugliness & ungainliness contradictory of beauty which had reemerged & long persisted is now sinking back into the shuddha & chidghana anandas. Kamananda was occasional & ceased to preserve conti- nuity; it now stands that the ananda can no longer be successfully excluded for a single day, but it is not yet continuously permanent because it still visits the body and does not yet hold it as its natural dharma. Arogya improved, but is still struggling against difficulties. Utthapana increases in force slowly & with difficulty. The weakness of the body & its capacity for exhaustion struggle powerfully to keep their hold."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"296 Record of Yoga Sept 17 t . h . Trikaldrishti & aishwarya went through a short period of confusion for the one, ineffectiveness for the other, but both have recovered their former activity, trikaldrishti accurate, often even in perfect detail, but with [deficiency] 2 in mahattwa, aishwarya ordi- narily effective after resistance. The tejasic powers tend to prevail over the tamasic, but have not yet an assured and perfect victory. In the afternoon clear images of various kinds in the antar- drishta jagrat, but all of the initial crudity of material. In the jagrat single clear images in the akasha come a little more frequently & lifelike images come before the eye, instead of avoiding it, but are not yet stable before the eye. Group images in the akasha are still imperfect in clearness. In the evening there came the perfectly clear & stable image in the akasha, single and small group, but this was limited to the non-lifelike & to one or two figures, ie different kinds of birds & butterflies; but in that limit even the most developed figures oc- curred with some freedom; a third image, (a cat on a bough,) came without the clearness. This was in the full evening light outside the house, in the subdued light of evening in the house, the images were repeated but not with such ease & absolute clearness, & at night in the lamplight they failed still more to acquire the full vividness. The force of association here was evident. Certain habitual images appear with more power in the lamplight, but this was in a different manner of vaguely compacted definiteness in a transition stage between the mere image & the lifelike image. Samadhi was again very powerful and this time short conversations occurred in some of which the speaker was visible as speaking, an almost entirely new circumstance. Scent also has begun & the first hint of taste. Trikaldrishti & will-power were again allowed to lapse into the pure intellectuality but this time a greater power to distinguish between the action of the two & consequently between true & false trikaldrishti was developed out of the confusion.

Kamananda increased in intensity. The personal lilamaya relation with the Master of the Yoga emerged, still feebly hampered by the old tapomaya & manomaya movements. Sept 18 t . h . The day passed largely in a struggle ending in disturbance & reaction, owing to the old insistence of the mental tejas, which had been suffered to act, on overstress & exaggeration and a blind undiscriminating belief; but the disturbance was not acute nor very prolonged nor the reaction very obstinate or far-reaching. The chief loss was the enthusiasm & reach of the faith which returned to its normal belief in final success with an added disposition to accept the truth of a steady & increasingly rapid success in the Yoga, as distinct from the life-work. As usual circumstances apparent & real crowded to justify the element of unfaith, but also there were some that supported the faith. The balance was more even than formerly. Trikaldrishti continues to deal with the old intellectualities which still persist in external suggestion; it is usually correct when the mind is not in haste; the suggestions of the external mind are often precise & correct but are so interspersed, like most of the other movements of knowledge, with overstressed & misapplied truths, that uncertainty still reigns. Power grows in effectiveness. The rupa failed to preserve in the daytime the sudden advance made last evening. Rupas were non-lifelike, crude or dense of the crude ten- dency &, seldom, developed tendency, limited to a few forms and did not come easily & spontaneously or effect an assured union of clearness & stability.

Neither the faith nor the energy recovered its tone during the evening and night. Still, progress was made. Something like the full bhava of the personal relation was manifested, and the relation itself is now permanent and secured against successful attack. The simulative vanis attempt to persist, but they cannot prevail, endure or pervert. The bhavas permanently manifest are those of conqueror and master, playmate and guide & instructor. There was also progress in the samadhi, smell & touch manifesting vividly, both combined with sight & action &, in the latter case, with sound; but the attempt to confirm & extend continuity failed. Dream manifested again full ihabhava of form & association, which could not, however, disturb the continuity & intelligibility of the series of incidents portrayed.

Finally, calm and ananda returned and the control of the divine guidance manifested. Kamananda was less intense, trikaldrishti & aishwarya very broken & the siege of the external intellect persistent and heavy. Samadhi made no progress, rupa only in the arrival of akasha rupa on a background, but lipi recovered & increased its force. Sept 20th 21st During these two days there has been a rapid and liberal efflo- rescence of the siddhi. Faith at once fixed & enthusiastic has been established which surmounts all immediate contradictions because it has knowledge of the truth beyond. This illumined, firm & enthu- siastic faith is being cured of its deficiencies and prepared for energy and action on a scale suitable to the life work. The process involves the display of the obstacles to the faith, defect of perfect prac- tical trikaldrishti, defect of effectiveness in will-power, adverse experience with regard to rapidity in Yoga and large foundation & development in the adeshasiddhi. Sraddha & energy of tapas are developing, not yet grown to their full vigour. The Mahakali bhava has therefore tended without effacing itself to draw back, no longer into its Maheshwari pratistha, this is the difference, but upon rather than into its Mahasaraswati continent. Trikaldrishti after displaying yesterday a great wideness & freedom of the satya is now removing the remnants of anritam, ordering the ritam in the ordinary practical trikaldrishti. The sur- viving defects are being remedied by a habitual illumination of the mental suggestions, when an intention or impulse tends to be falsely stressed as event to be, a corrective illumination increasingly comes either along with the suggestion or immediately behind it; the mental suggestions themselves now, more often than not, justify themselves either in the immediate event or, if baffled immediately, in subsequent event.

Will power grows in force & is usually successful in whole or in part when associated with trikaldrishti, often even when it is not. Its rapid & exact effect is frequent on things in motion, less frequent on things in rest where the opposition has time to take cognisance and make itself felt. Lipi continues to grow in frequency of legibility; for this purpose the immediate intelligibility (even of the undecipherable script, for that too is gained) has been suspended somewhat from its activity. Akasha rupa is now fairly constant in all forms of unlifelike image, but chiefly in the crude, more often & clearly in single figure than in the group. The old defects of instability, remoteness in the prana akash, indistinctness in the blur of the material tend to depart, but strive yet successfully to remain & be frequent. The perfect rupa strengthens itself but does not stabilise in its clear forms to the direct vision. A few rupas (bird, butterfly, moth, horse, horseman, etc) predominate & recur with unwearied reiteration, but the drishti is no longer confined to them. In the antardrishta jagrat independent manifestation has begun; one or two perfect images have shown themselves & vari- ety is freer than in the bahirdarshi jagrat. Swapna Samadhi grows slowly, but is stationary in the parts resisted, inconstantly organised in those established. Chitra & sthapatya grow in brilliance, richness & variety, rapidly & spontaneously, unaided even by the immediate will beyond a usually passive ishita. Kamananda, usually intense only in isolated touches more or less rapidly repeated, became yesterday intense to the point of maithunananda with continuously repeated touches, but owing to the fear of effusion, it was stayed before it could develop. Never- theless the habitual intensity is now much greater & keener than formerly, but varies in continuity. The inner anandas have well established themselves & work whenever there is smarana, as does also the consciousness of the Brahman in all objects which grows always in strength, intense universality & richness.. The remaining symptomatic rogas are being steadily extruded, but are violent or obstinate before their outgoing.

The siddhi has now firm standing in knowledge, in spite of lapses & lacunae, and the guiding Script can be invested in a definite form. The guiding Script orders & indicates, it does not predict. Its movement must be entirely liberated from the shadow of control by the minds vigilance, suggestive & distrustful, which still subsists in the environmental outlook. The trikaldrishti has been reconstituted and needs only a greater illumination & decisive[ness] to get rid of the one positive defect that still clogs it from perfec- tion, false distribution of stress by the masquerading of mental will-suggestions in the guise of knowledge-perceptions. That once cured, the range of practical knowledge will automatically increase. The willpower is as yet unable to act without a Prakritic resistance in the physical akasha. This habit of resistance must steadily be overborne and eliminated. It is especially active when continuous & detailed movements are dictated by the willpower to external objects, but this resistance has been overborne before and must now be overborne habitually. Finally, the actuality of the lipi, rupa & samadhi must prevail over the blind and inert, but stubborn refusal of the physical ether. This is the immediate work that yet remains in the third chatusthaya. In the fourth, it is now evident that what is being prepared by the apparent reaction towards asiddhi of continuity in the ka- mananda, is the ability of the body to bear the high intensity of maithunananda without emission and its distribution as ananda throughout the body. A stronger force of natural health and a more perfect habit of assimilation is being prepared by the suspension of the imperfect siddhi in arogya.

The apparent movement of reaction has ended, even more than usual, in a strong advance. The basis of samata has been strengthened and widely confirmed in the fixed perception of all things as true & all events as destined and helpful; if asamata now comes, it must be a purely mechanical movement of memory in the physical parts, unless knowledge is forcibly taken away. This in future will not be allowed. With samata dasya, tejas, sraddha have attained a more perfect security. All that is now needed is the expulsion of the physical memory of adasya & nistejas and the perfection of effective tapas in the knowledge & the power to establish the sraddha of the Ishwari in the Prakriti; the mere human sraddha is now well founded except in the adeshasiddhi. The faith in rapidity is really part of the faith in the adeshsiddhi, its condition and foundation. The relics of the egoistic outlook & inlook in the physical mind have also to be expelled. The basis of effectiveness in knowledge has been laid, the centre of true sight, ritam in satyam, has been revealed in action perfectly removing anrita suggestions, suggesting and approving the ritam. The basis of effectiveness in action has not been revealed. This will now have to be done. Sept 29 th Asamata still comes in the physical brain; therefore it is some- times thought that it is possessing the mind & heart, but it only touches the outskirts & departs. Even this remnant is taking too long to expel owing to the liability of the physical brain to be clouded which prevents the vijnana from fixing itself on the whole being except in & through the intellectuality. The finality of ac- curacy in detail of time, place & circumstance must now be well established. The time has come to distinguish always between truth and error, even in the trikaldrishti. It will not be done perfectly at once, but finally in itself and, for the rest, in its application progressively.

The trikaldrishti is now firm & acts with comparative ease, but not sufficiently swift & spontaneous and it is besieged and limited in its range, perfect only in the completeness of its intellectual apparatus. The habit of confused suggestions between which the vijnana has to distinguish, must be eliminated; the revelation & inspiration replace the vivek as the most frequent & important activities of the vijnana. The aishwarya etc are not yet lifted into the ritam. These things however will now inevitably fulfil themselves. The barrier to the rupadrishti has also at last been broken & the remain- ing difficulties in that & in the swapna-samadhi will now follow suit.

Telepathy The first necessity is to recognise unfalteringly that all intellec- tual suggestions, however void of support in the appearances of ac- tuality, however contradicted by evidence are satyam, prakamya or vyapti of actual intentions, tendencies, impulses etc in the world and connected with the objects or subjects in regard to which they occur to the mind. The next is to get rid of misplacement and assign these suggestions to their cause in fact. This has first to be done in the way of correction of error after the event, next, by correction of error before the event, last, by cessation of error & the immediate & essential right assignment and definition of the vyapti or the prakamya. At present, the movement is towards passing from the first to the second stage of the process. Time-idea The time idea is still obstructed and prevented from regu- lating itself. Today it has to break through the obstruction. The non-telepathic pure trikaldrishti has also to become more active. Jnana The jnana is now perfectly established in the intellect. All the thoughts are perceived to be true and are assigned, oftenest initially, but sometimes by a corrective movement to their right place & form. The corrective movement itself is not so much purgative of error as adjustive of an incomplete or crooked placement. As soon as this corrective movement ceases to be necessary, the jnana can be entirely lifted into the ideality and the fourth line, soon to be added to the jnana, invested with the sign of completion.

The Ishwarabhava has temporarily gone back to its less developed stage. The faith is now strong in the Yoga siddhi and established as to its rapidity, but not with regard to the Adesh. The temporary setback in the Ishwarabhava is due to the inactivity of the Aishwarya. It will now rapidly develop to the third power along with the Abhayam & Premakama. Bhukti The discomfort of cold & heat is rapidly becoming ananda. The element of discomfort has to be eliminated. Pain alone will remain, then, as a negative element in the bhukti. The discomfort of roga is intermediary between pain & physical discomfort of the nervous system. Dehasuddhi In the physical siddhi, shuddhi of the body is almost complete. It consists of three parts, ras ashuddhi, pranasuddhi, bhutasuddhi. The rasas are on the verge of complete purity; the panchapr ́ anas are withdrawing from their separateness into the state of differ- entiated activities of the mukhya prana, that is their purity; but the movement is not yet completed. The pancha bhutas are also falling into line as movements & states of the akasha; but this last movement is still obstructed seriously. Its imperfection is the excuse for the continuance of roga in the processes of assimilation, as the panchaprana cannot work perfectly in the present state of the panchabhuta; that imperfection of the pr ́ anas is again the cause of excessive & defective action of the rasas, causing slight eruption on the skin & indeterminate tendencies of cough & cold.

From now forward the organisation of the ritam will proceed steadily on the basis of the satyam brihat with a determining supe- rior faculty which will eliminate the anritam & exalt the intellectual movements into the ideality. Physical Ananda, more & more obstructed and suppressed during the past few days, will now recover its activity.

Its four main defects have all shown themselves in exaggerated sensations out of all proportion to the reality of the roga behind. This is always a sign of failing power & approaching exhaustion; for the hostile forces, conscious of the failure, gather up & exhaust in an illegitimate endeavour all the forces which, properly used, might last for a longer season than that actually allotted to them. The Maheshwari patience is still needed to support these tyrannies, samata, dhairyam. Mahakali tapas begins to break through the habitual restric- tions of the Mahasaraswati bhava. Nov 18 t . h . The second chatusthaya is still capable of check and thin cloud- ings, owing to the non-fulfilment of tapas and prakasha. But this defect does not belong to itself; it is a reflex action from the violently obstinate obstruction to the vijnana. The yuddhalipsa and ananda in check and obstruction must be perfected in order to overcome this reactionary tendency. They will henceforward be insisted upon till they are secure from attack. The force of the vijnana is once more clouded, but it is only for a short time. The doubt & inertia are in error, not the tejas and tapas. It is true that the siddhi is successfully obstructed in the three positive chatusthayas, but the obstruction is itself a means for a greater siddhi. The mere physical impact on the prana, giving an impression of doubt, discouragement or asamata, is of no essential importance for the mind refuses to receive the impression & even the psychical prana rejects it quickly. The one thing that still affects the mind is doubt. The faith in the Adesh and in the rapidity of the siddhi is now about to establish itself beyond serious clouding in the light of Surya. It will take a few days to eliminate the causes of doubt, but they will produce no effect when they come. The knowledge is once more satyam brihat with a more un- trammelled & well combined brihat & a nearer approach to the perfect ritam. Moreover the rapid use of the faculties for ritam has now commenced.

Now, though it is not yet the rule that the first perceptions should be the correct percep- tions, yet that is the tendency established and it is more often the attempts of doubt to correct the first perceptions that go wrong. The rapid effectuality of the tapas is being prepared. Yuddhalipsa is well-established. Ananda in the check is still unable to take firm possession of the prana, but it is there in the rest of the system. Owing to its weakness in the prana, it comes oftener retrospectively after the event than simultaneously with the event. The tendency of the ritam has already increased to a powerful extent; it is only combated by the doubt & the twilight false stress on a misapplied perception. Physical siddhi will be strongly resumed from today. The bodily samata has now reached, in prolonged exposure to strong heat, the fixed stage of udasinata and nati, the former predominating, with touches of discomfort which are met & ex- pelled by the titiksha. The ananda of heat is not yet strong & firm like the ananda of cold. Long exposure to strong cold has yet to be tested. The kamananda is once more only occasional, but the Shakti will now attempt the firm foundation of the panchavidha shari- rananda kama, vishaya, tivra, raudra & vaidyuta. Lipi is in itself entirely perfect except in the immediate spon- taneity of manifestation, but the old indistinct lipis, intelligible but not legible, continue to recur from the old force of habit in the material ́ ak ́ asha, a habit artificially maintained long after all real justification for it has ceased. With this exception all that has to be added is the free & varied play of the lipi unbroken by intervals of non-manifestation. Ananda of defeat has been reestablished by the revival of the brihat activity of the Vijn ́ ana. It will not again be allowed to be broken. But it must be assimilated with the Mahakali tapas; it must be not the acquiescent ananda of Mahasaraswati, but the temporary acceptance of Mahakali who takes defeat only as a step on the way to victory & presses forward immediately to the siddhi and yashahpr ́ apti."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"318 Record of Yoga There remains the removal of doubt and the physical depres- sion habitually resulting from doubt.

Even the first which is nearest to absolute finality has been disturbed yesterday & has not yet recovered its balance. It is firm in the mass, but not on the surface of the mentality. In the second a temporary perfection, deficient only in faith, abhayam, ishwarabhava, was broken, it is indicated, in order that the dasatya & tapatya buddhi might be combined, taking the place of the old alternation between passive and udasina dasya-buddhi and active egoistic tapas; the combination represents the right Mahakali tapas.

This vijnanabuddhi has now to arrange its movements in the surya jyotis. Kamananda has to recover its recurrent activity. The tapas, active in the lower estate of being in front of a veiled Chit and blind to it or to all but a few illuminations from it mostly ill-directed by the gropings of the manas in the twilight of the manasa buddhi, is in the higher estate of being and must therefore be in this siddhi, first a selected activity of the Chit on the background of the luminous Chit and ultimately a reproduction or cumulative result of the Chit. Henceforward therefore the tapas and the faculties of power, aishwarya, ishita, vashita must be habituated to act on the background of the knowledge, first as the selected activity, then as the cumulative result. Knowledge of the general state of being & of the forces at work in any given Apas is now fairly perfect in wideness (brihat) & in satyam; but the defect of the ritam arises in the attempt of manasabuddhi either as stress of speculation, mental knowledge tapas, (manasasmriti, judgment, imagination, memory working on observation & by inference) or"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"326 Record of Yoga as stress of mental will-tapas to select the event or the decisive force out of the Sat & the Tapas.

The only things that have hitherto held firm are some of the incomplete siddhis, eg vyaptiprakamya, physical ananda etc. Sarvasaundaryabodha struggles to reestablish itself, but is only partially successful.

If that is a true indication, it is a step in the right direction; but appearances are so deceitful that future events must be watched before the indication can be trusted. The old confidence in the selective trikaldrishti as opposed to the trikaldrishti of tendencies & possibilities has been too much undermined for me to accept any longer even the most obvious suggestions, especially where the mind interprets events in the sense of my own desires. Trikaldrishti, it is evident, is still only fitfully correct in its selective & determinative activity, but increasingly perfect in the pure perceptive. This however acts within a very small range. Rupa (Akasharupa & chitra) is now growing stronger. Clear human figures in the akasha are becoming frequent. Communica- tion of Yoga by vyapti to those practising in the immediate vicinity is also becoming stronger. Aishwarya is no longer an occasional output of will working upon an obstinate plastic material, but a powerful Shakti struggling with another powerful Shakti. The opposing force is still habitually the occupant of the Akasha and successful when not overborne by a strong & persistent pressure. The weakness of this movement, although it is capable of bringing about sudden powerful results, is that it establishes only a momentary force in the Akasha, instead of a permanently growing Power of Nature in the material ether which will form a dominant centre of Kali always responsive to the Purusha in this Adhara. It is noticeable that when this Shakti fails in its effort, the object after executing a contrary or different movement, returns to fulfil the original will when the struggle is over. This seems to show that the adverse Power in the akasha is also not a native of the Akasha & therefore has little more staying power than the Shakti of this Adhara. It is stronger only by use of the previously existing natural obstruction in the ether considered as a plastic material. It is also noticeable that when the object sits tight in its resistance, circumstances often arrive which compel it to execute the willed movement.

This is apparently what is immediately intended by a recent lipi, “It is useless to distinguish life from Yogasiddhi.” It remains to be seen whether, as is suggested, these limitations are so powerfully brought forward, because they are on the point of being removed. The last defect is the tendency to create only a temporary result, then relapse, then succeed, & so slowly move to some kind of final success. Unless this defect is removed the rapidity so often promised cannot come. The Brahmadrishti is now well-regulated, but still depends on smarana, the Sarva, Ananta & Ananda are more prominent than the Jnana Brahman.

In all cases there is rasagrahana, but not pritih or ananda. Pritih is only beginning. Kamananda is resuming its former maithuna intensity. An extension of the jnanam Brahma has brought into play a rich action of the telepathic trikaldrishti. Hitherto what was seen were the immediate forces of possibility & actuality in operation outside the living objects which act, pranad ejad, proceeding from elemental or other powers who people the universe; inside the living object were seen the mental states, feelings, impulses, tendencies, thoughts, nervous & physical states, proper to the conscious wak- ing mind; now a fresh element enters with the clear perception of the dominant idea in the superconscious dream-mind (manomaya purusha), which dictates usually the ultimate action. Beyond this is the non-telepathic trikaldrishti which can alone perceive what is the unalterable eventuality actually destined. This perception is contained in the sleep mind of the manomaya purusha, where all beings know the past, present & future. The rest is a matter of range, arrangement & proper action of the knowledge. The perception is now goagram aswapeshasam. Utthapana of the neck, raised position, maintained for a quar- ter of an hour; not yet at ease; laghima & mahima partially mani- fest, anima defective.

Utthapana of the left leg, horizontal position lying on the side, half an hour. Laghima strong, mahima sufficient, violent an-anima in the sinew or nerve; of the right leg, horizontal position, lying on the back, ten minutes; urdhwagati deficient; of the neck, middle position, 20 minutes, difficulty of an-anima much reduced. In the afternoon utthapana of the right leg, lying on the side, 10 min- utes, violent an-anima in the sinew compelled cessation, although laghima and mahima were sufficient. Kamananda established itself in standing & walking.

A movement was made to the same end in the rest of the vijnana, especially in swapnasamadhi where all the obstinate defects of the past broke down initially in type. Poetry resumed Dec 1 st The whole day has been devoted to a struggle, attended by revived asiddhi & relapse into all the circumstances of mentality, to establish the organisation of the ritam in trikaldrishti, telepathy etc on the basis of entire Brahmabodha including especially the jnanam Brahma. The one positive result is the intensity of the Brahma bodha. Subjective ananda has ceased in the prema, ex- cept occasionally; the chidghana is assailed by obstructions which prevent the secure possession of its bhoga, & even in some habitual features of the ideal rasagrahana and priti. Utthapana of the right arm for half an hour without difficulty in the horizontal position, and after an interval of three minutes for another half hour against an increasing pressure of an-anima. Advantage was taken of the muscular stress to confirm the ananda (rasa, priti & bhoga) of strong & insistent muscular pain. Kamananda at night began to recur in the state of samadhi Dec 2 d .. Utthapana of the legs, horizontal position, successively, a fail- ure due to entire defect of anima and for the most part of mahima. Like the Brahmabuddhi yesterday, the Brahmaprema today was universalised and raised to a high intensity, bringing with it entire premananda on men, animals, objects & events. The movement now is to confirm all the anandas, except the physical, & the sub- jective siddhi generally, prema, kama, shama in the Ekam Brahma, so assuring it on the bahu, & no longer perfected by application through the Avidya to each object separately. So far as that move- ment was necessary, it has been accomplished, but it can only be finally safeguarded from interruption & relapse by being secured in the ekatwadrishti of buddhi, heart, indriyas & sanjna generally.

Faith also has been established in the truth of the instruments of knowledge; the satyam brihat is entirely confirmed & the truth of misapplied satyam is habitually perceived either before, with or after the event. The ritam however is yet defective, although its hold on the ac- tive consciousness increases & there is still uncertainty about the Adeshasiddhi & consequently about the entire rapidity of the phys- ical siddhi & karmasiddhi. The rest is felt to be assured, since all the members are rapidly growing [in] force. There is constant pressure of the will on the asaundarya, but its compact resistance is yet far from being broken. In the afternoon the resistance to the Will had entirely the upper hand and a period of Asiddhi began, with its usual circum- stances. This movement has continued since and such siddhi as manifests, appears with difficulty and as from behind a veil. The successful contradiction in all the Chatusthayas continues, although hitherto it has not been so acute as in the more successful invasions. Swapnasamadhi continues to grow in strength, especially in initial continuity of scenic action and coherence & intelligibility of lipi. Akasharupa is not yet able to confirm itself in the Akasha, but it manifests with an imperfect & fragmentary persistence. The frequency of vivid lipi is much obstructed. The attempt in the Brahmabodha to unify the upalabdhi of the Atman & of the Ishwara with the upalabdhi of the Brahman has begun, but is not yet successful. Separately, they are all well devel- oped.

In India, (1) the amalgamation of all powers under a single control (2) the provision of equipment & means for their work (3) their protection in the period of growth. All this has to be done not by material means, but by tapas of the ideality through Aishwarya, Ishita, Vashita. The single con- trol is Gods own, not any intermediarys. During the peripeties a certain number of untoward incidents are inevitable; they must be minimised and finally obviated. 3. The strengthening of the centre, not only in self, but in outward reputation, means & power, so as to render it intangible. The first necessity is perfect vijnanabuddhi and Brahmabuddhi. Neither of these are unprogressive, but neither are allowed to estab- lish themselves firmly in the system owing to the constant successful invasion of the asiddhi, which no longer confines itself to this or that particularity, but seeks to cover the whole field. Nevertheless, the nodus of the asiddhi is unfaith based on uncertainty as to whether the central theory of the Yoga, namely the Apas, Tapas & Adesha is not a falsehood and a self-delusion. Much more than the doubt On 1 December Sri Aurobindo began a separate Record on loose sheets of paper. On 12 December he returned to the notebook that he had used for most of the Record of 1913. There are entries both in the notebook and on the loose sheets for three dates: 1, 2 and 12 December."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"1–12 December 1913 335 about the rapidity, is this the root of the whole disorder. No part of the siddhi has been allowed to remain free from the successful attack of the Asiddhi. If any part were firmly acquired, the rapid addition of the rest could not be resisted with any hope of success. As it is, the siddhi progresses & even progresses rapidly but with a broken & resisted rapidity. Much was expected of yesterdays movement, but it has been followed up by a struggle, not a victory. The intensifying of the Brahmabuddhi is the one positive gain, & to this may be added the firm extension of the brihat in the jnana with the mixed satya & anrita of trikaldrishti & telepathy. The difficulty is in the insufficient strengthening of the decisive viveka & the insufficient finality of the transfer of the intellectual movements to the vijnanabuddhi. The lipi announcing the finality of the transfer referred only to the completion of the process, not to the security of the results attained. The attack has destroyed the conditions of the vijnana manifesta- tion and they have to be reconstituted in the active consciousness. There is as yet no finality of settled truth or settled effectiveness. This is one side of the truth; the other is that the transfer has been finally secured, since it is only in appearance that the ideality has been disintegrated in the active consciousness. The disintegration is real to the intellectual judgment, not to the viveka. Dec. 2. The Adesha-siddhi is seen to be more possible than before, but not yet certain in fact, still less in time and extent. The confirmation of the faculties of knowledge in certainty, the confirmation of the faculties of power in effectiveness are the means by which the faith in the Adesha-siddhi will be established. At present both of these are effectively resisted in the outer swabhava; while the first two chatusthayas are effectively resisted only by invasion from the outer world-environment. This confirmation need not at first extend to invariable certainty & effectiveness, but to the exclusion of general uncertainty & general ineffectiveness. At present it is seen that the power can produce given particular effects, but its control of the final effect is still poor, & so long as this is so, it cannot be held to"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"336 Record of Yoga be siddha. Nevertheless, the hold on the final effect is increasing in force. Dec. 3 There has been a relapse, as powerful as the combined forces of the outer world could make it. The attack on the samata has been furious and has had some superficial success, but the dhana, the parvata remains unmoved & intact. The second chatusthaya has been successfully inhibited from its full & arranged action, but here too the success is superficial. The third has been partially affected in knowledge, entirely in the unfinished parts of power; not at all in samadhi. The rest has been obstructed, not really affected. The fourth & fifth have been obstructed & to a certain extent injured. The first thing, as always, is to restore the anandamaya action of the vijnanabuddhi and Brahmabuddhi. This after a long interval is being done. Dispelling & expelling of the intellectual & emotional activity forced again on the system is the indispensable preliminary, and this is often difficult because it entangles itself, by habit or of deliberate purpose, with the legitimate action. Absolute passivity, absolute sraddha in the Master of All, is the means. There is no other means. It is essential that all should be recognised as the being & action of the Ishwara and yet that the two agencies Arya & Anarya should be distinguished. Dec 4. The passivity & sraddha are being established, first, without any demand, but always with the udasina lipsa. The tapas is not yet pure of the temperamental stress left by desire & preference. There is still a preference, but of tapas purely, not of Ananda. The full Mahakali Mahasaraswati Tapas cannot manifest without a greater power of vijnana. There must now emerge the determinative knowledge & the determinative aishwarya, forming the ritam of the jnana & tejas, satyatapatya, satyadrishti. Henceforth the tamas will be steadily eliminated from the pranic system & the body. The perceptions are real in themselves, not right in the mental impression produced."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"1–12 December 1913 337 Dec 5 There must be the full activity of the kriti; only the means must first come. No more action without means. Therefore a period of repose is necessary; for self-collection & for emergence. The opposite tendency belongs to the intellectual tejas. The action of the intellectual tejas is still habitual as an invol- untary accompaniment to internal & external activity. Its removal is the condition of perfect vijnana. There must be no straining after truth of knowledge or efficacy of power, but natural prakasha and tapas. The freedom of the mind from intellectual speculation is being restored. The asiddhi that has come is assisting the reestablishment of the second chatusthaya on the basis of a perfected nati and samata. The positive ananda, sraddha and Mahakali tapas have now to be restored. There was a slight disturbance, but it has righted itself; only the result is the tapas without the sraddha. As for the ananda, it is there & will now be entirely confirmed. There is the beginning of the satya tejas & satya tapas, but only as yet the beginning. Dec 6 The pressure of the old tejas has been removed from the central system, but it still surrounds the nature. When that is dispelled then the present difficulties will disappear. At present it seems that the intellectuality is justified in certain of its conclusions; but on the contrary it is the ideality. The clearance of the doubt has only begun. All that may be true, yet the ideality may be justified. Dec 7. No appearance of failure should be allowed to affect the funda- mental faith. It is true that the defect of overstress in the knowledge has not been cured, the struggle to establish the ritam seems to have failed, the Vani seems once more to have misled; but all this will be cleared as soon as this siege of the environment is lifted. It is now clear that the brihat satyam of telepathy & telepathic trikaldrishti is perfect in all but thought & even, though more ob- structed, in the thought. It is clear also that the positive trikaldrishti"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"338 Record of Yoga which decides & arranges or is itself naturally the ritam is on the point of perfection, but prevented from consistently manifesting. The satya tejas & satya tapas have first to be perfectly manifested. Now the satyam, brihat & an imperfect ritam of the tapas in aishwarya, ishita [&] vashita, have been manifested in a series of movements. This siddhi also is liable to interruption and ob- scuration, but for the future it stands & will always emerge from the obscuration & overcome the interruption. The confirmation of these powers in the Yoga, the life, the body is awaited. The instances of successful tapas are becoming more frequent, as predicted in the lipi, & are on the point of generality. The lipi “ruler of the subjectivity of others” is also being justified. What has now to be done is to break down the remaining resistance, whether near or at a distance, whether in subjectivity or objectivity, whether in sadhana or life. Although it is not apparent, this can be done rapidly. Finally, the success of the siddhi in knowledge is now well founded. The ritam has begun to be well-established & increasingly powerful everywhere. It is now being developed & fixed in the tejasic touches, at the side, in the lipi & the telepathy of thought. It is already dominant in the central viveka & the general telepathy. The foundation has been laid for the final transfer of the thought & knowledge from the vijnanabuddhi to the vijnana. The powers of Tapas increase in their dominance & insistence. Samadhi, manifesting from time to time, shows always a little more progress. Only the rupa is now strongly obstructed. Dec 8. The Tapas having confirmed its general force in particular actions, seeks now to get at the centre of the Bhuh-Prakriti and command final result. The movement in saundarya is still positively adverse & in the rest stationary with a tendency to relapse. The script has been justified; it will therefore continue to deal with future as well as present; but all instruments are still weak in exactness of time & place & order. The distant future is also not yet included in the range of their proper action, except in isolated examples.

The health & utthapana will rapidly follow in the next two or three days. Already physical ananda (kama) is becoming common in samadhi & dream & seeks to prolong itself there. It needs now only fixity in continuity & intensity. The physical ananda has already begun its battle for fixity with a series of initial successes. These are now confirmed by an outbreak of ahaituka maithunananda unparalleled as yet in its prolonged continuity & intensity. The continuity & intensity are now being constantly repeated, though the ahaituka maithunananda is still rare. Dec 9. The growth of ananda & preparation of health are being fulfilled. Utthapana remains. There has once more been a storm in the subjective ananda due to the siege of egoistic mentality from the environment centred in the intellectuality. This will now pass away & the finally perfected knowledge & power prevail steadily & swiftly over the ajnana.

This is the first time the utthapana has been so pro- longed; the longest previous period even for the vertical position, lying down, which has long been entirely conquered, was 3 hours. Ananda has been persistent, except for discontinuance at night & early this morning, but it has been more in the suppressed & subdued forms than in the intensity. Utthapana of the left leg, medial position, for half an hour. Mahima insufficient; no pronounced ananima. Dec 10. The same break in the physical Ananda. Health is strengthen- ing itself, but not yet established. There is also a disturbance in the third chatusthaya owing to the outbreak of excessive stress usually associated with the Mahakali Tapas. There is, however, no reaction. The tapas is fixed & indeed the whole second chatusthaya except the sraddha in the Adeshasiddhi. Today the basis of the faith has to be soundly laid. The re- newed attack on the health must be pushed away and arogya founded, though not yet perfected, in the deficient parts. Only the kamachakra remains for a slower process. Utthapana has to be pre- pared in the other parts of the body. Rupa develops more perfectly. Utthapana of the neck for 20 minutes.

The developments of the Yoga from the 1st to the 12th have been noted on separate sheets; this interruption is a concession to the transitional disturbances that result from the constant and almost unintermitting siege of the world-environment. In future it is intended to disregard the siege in its results, merely noting its recurrence, except where its results are positive & produced in the yet unestablished movements of the siddhi. The faith in the eventual Yogasiddhi can no longer be inter- rupted; for, even when the opposite suggestion is made & supported by the rationally irrational intellect of infinite possibility, the unfaith is rejected & thrown back into its proper element. The faith in the rapidity of the Yogasiddhi is also positive in its substance, except with regard to saundaryam & karma, but varies in its intensity and incidence. Only the faith in the Adeshasiddhi is still in the inchoate condition. The transfer of the perceptive & determinative intellectuality to the ideal plane has been violently & artificially retarded for the last two or three days by rushes of cloud & confusion, by a con- stant hammering of apparent refutation & ill-result at the sraddha.

Karmasiddhi awaits the faith in the Adeshasiddhi. Kamananda throughout the day was active, insistent except for intervals of forcible obstructi on, recurrent when not continuous; but in the sitting or lying position, estopped for the time in the erect or in ambulation. The siege was allowed to prevail in the evening so far as tem- porarily to interrupt the faith & knowledge & produce old & long discontinued movements. Utthapana throughout the day was unsuccessful. Akasharupa is still in the same condition, manifesting, but unable to possess & hold the Akash, an intruder & not a resident. Arogya still struggles, on the whole with a qualified success, against the fragmentarily recurrent or persistently recurrent denials of arogya. These denials are fragmentarily recurrent in the phlegm, cough & neuralgia (& in itch except one spot,) & unable to fasten on the body, persistent, without itch, in the eruption, persistently recurrent in the slighter ailments of the digestion. The tendency of urination has been much reduced during the last three or four days. Dec 13 th The siege has, today, been lifted, but the full vijnana is not yet manifest. At present the siddhis of power are being allowed to manifest through the Bhuvar tapas or the Swar-tapas on the objectivity. Manifesting through the Bhuvar tapas the Will tends to produce powerfully immediate results & more intermittently, often by indirect means & after much tergiversation, final results; manifesting through the Swar tapas it fastens more often on general than on particular effectualities or seizes only on the general effect & some of the effectuating movements. When the pure Chittapas manifests in vijnanabuddhi & manasbuddhi, there is a more consis- tent simultaneous & sometimes identical knowledge & effectuality, but the manasabuddhi is constitutionally averse or unable to hold for a long time the continuous activity of the Chittapas. When this Power is thus active through vijnanabuddhi & manasabuddhi,"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"344 Record of Yoga the knowledge also tends to lapse back from the ideality to these organs. It is now especially at home in vijnanabuddhi, where it perceives all or most of the forces at work, the possibilities, many of the immediate actualities & sometimes the eventual actuality. The movement is now towards a levelling up of the siddhis of Power & siddhis of knowledge. Script & vani have been made manifest to the mind in such a way that the real script & real vani can be distinguished from their secondary reproductions & from false simulations. Egoistic activity has been once more expelled and driven back into the world-environment. The Jiva is now only a secondary ishwara, bhokta, bharta & jnata receiving all things as a centre of enjoyment & lordship for the Purushottama. Kamananda is once more active in the erect position and dur- ing movement of the body, but intermittently, not with continuity. There is an initial movement towards its recovered action at night and in samadhi. Trikaldrishti of telepathy has once more manifested; it has two movements, one purely receptive, in which the movements past, present & future of an object reach the mind, but there is no active knowledge or discrimination of their actuality & relations till after the event, and a second both receptive & discriminative in which the future eventuality is correctly known before the event. In both cases but especially the first any tapasic stress on the intention, tendency, thought or impulse of the object as indicative of the eventual movement, leads to error; the same is true, if there is any attempt to infer intellectually the result from past or present data. Self-active non-telepathic trikaldrishti is at present more of the skylight than of the direct variety. This is not, however, always the case. The just telepathy of thought which has hitherto been very poor in range and uncertain, is now in frequent play, eg in watching cardplay to know the idea in the mind of the player, but it has not yet its full exactness, only a general truth. It is showing itself from the beginning to be more reliable than the words & signs of the thinker, from which often false inferences are drawn. Right interpretation of lipi and rupa are also prevailing over the intellectual, imaginative and speculative interpretations."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"12–21 December 1913 345 The tapas has greatly increased in effectiveness without being yet master of the akasha In the afternoon there was a relapse to intellectuality and inef- fectiveness with a lowering of the Mahakali tapas. The system took refuge in subjective inertia. The animal form which for a long time was excluded from the Chitra, is now of frequent occurrence and a rich perfection & variety, though not as yet on a level with the human form & the landscape. The separate inanimate object and groups of objects have also begun to manifest. The tapas is working on the Akasharupa, but it still fails to hold the physical ether; nevertheless it tends towards a more lingering transience than its former entirely fugitive display. Shabda & other drishtis are still very rare & poor in range &, usually, in force. Tivrananda is acquiring intensity in its sukshma touches. Utthapana of the left arm, horizontal position, commenced while recumbent on the right side, was visited at once with a vi- olent pain of ananima; after some minutes changed to the sitting position & walking, the ananima diminished, & the utthapana was maintained with increasing force for an hour & a half, but the an- anima finally returned & terminated it. The right arm continued for an hour; then ananima grew suddenly upon it. It is noticeable that when held out rigidly, the ananima takes the form of strong muscular pain in the shoulder muscle; when held easily & slightly crooked, the ananima comes after a long time & takes the form rather of uneasiness. In both cases there is no pull of gravitation from below, the laghima of the arms being perfect, but a pressure of gravity from above, oppressing the mahima through ananima. Utthapana of the back persisted for nearly 5 minutes with intervals of varying pressure & growing urdhwagati. Other utthapanas were unsuccessful.

There is a growing strength of Samadhi; shabda & sparsha returned & were combined with rupa & action; distinct & coher- ent lipis occurred; the actions seen were more prolonged and better organised. The organisation however, as well as the prolongation, is still rudimentary. Kamananda was this time successfully established in the night, but is only occasional in sleep or samadhi. The body is still unable to maintain it with perfect continuity; although the relapse is now a habit forcibly maintained, and not at all a neces- sary relief or respite. Akasharupa maintains the same character of persistent pressure on the Akasha without possession or any real stability. Arogya in the digestive faculties seems now to be tending away from the struggle between health & the petty fragments of digestive ailments (for nausea, constipation[,] diarrhoea etc have for some time been absent from the system except in touches of looseness, obstruction, nauseative tendency) to the old struggle between ab- normal assimilation of food & normal or abnormal waste. For the last two days waste has been abnormal. Waste has to become subnormal without disturbing the digestive processes. Kamananda is now fixed, either recurrent or continuous, in all states except that of sleep & samadhi. Sukshma tivrananda is rapidly devel- oping ubiquity & intensity. All the sahaituka physical anandas are now constant in the body, except vaidyuta which is yet rare and occasional. Ahaituka tivrananda is now becoming spontaneous although usually with some aid from smarana. The subjective anandas, although well-established, are liable to clouding especially by the loss of the sense of beauty in the adaptation of form to guna. If the Brahman is seen in the guna of a face that is mean or ugly, the meanness or ugliness becomes itself beautiful to the inner eye & through the inner eye to the outer vision; but, this failing, the shuddha & premanandas fail by temporary loss of the chidghana. Premananda is also attacked by old sanskaras of relation & non-relation. Normally, however, chidghana, ahaituka & suddha are permanently manifest; prema is there usually in the priti, not so commonly in the bhoga. Arrangement of lipi has been well-established both in chitra"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"12–21 December 1913 347 and akasha. The struggle now is between the slowly growing inten- sity & vividness of the letters & the old tendency to vagueness, dimness & illegibility. This intensity & vividness was formerly perfect, but exceptional, it is now imperfect, but tends to be nor- mal. The lipi is usually intelligible even when imperfectly legible, but its interpretation by the ideality is often obstructed; eg the lipi Pyrotechnics on the Kart[t]ik Purnima. Owing to the minds ignorance of the fact that it was Karttik Purnima or that here it is usual to have fireworks on that tithi, the lipi remained unintel- ligible in its main purpose until the evening when the fireworks began. Utthapana of the right leg, medial position, for half an hour with but slight ananima, discontinued owing to deficiency of established laghima and mahima. Subsequently utthapana of the back attempted without success, owing partly to commencement with the medial position, attempted again and successful[ly] main- tained for 15 minutes; increasing laghima & mahima made the utthapana easier & easier, instead of its becoming more difficult by long continuance, and at the end only a slight dull pain of ananima in the hips and vepathu survived out of the first strong asiddhi. The back was then lowered to the medial position & could have been maintained owing to strong laghima, but there was violent vepathu; the utthapana was discontinued owing to an external occurrence, otherwise it might have been maintained for an indefinitely longer period. This is the first time utthapana of the back has been established. Confusion of the first & second chatusthaya, due to confusion of the third, again occurred. The difficulty in distinguishing the Personality of the Master of the Yoga, owing to the interference of inferior personalities, is now a main cause of unfaith & discontent. In the afternoon the confusion was cleared from the first & second chatusthaya, though still left in the third, in order that there might be no farther premature demand & therefore reaction of disappointment & discontent; the main agent in the clearance has been the final subtle but perfect distinction in the vivek between the supreme vani & script (not yet active) & the minor, secondary & immediately active & directive vani & script which are henceforth"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"348 Record of Yoga leading the siddhi forward. A similar distinction is being made but not yet perfected between ideal & un-ideal stresses of tapas & prakasha. At the same time the final transfer of the remnants of intellectuality to the ideal plane through the vijnana buddhi has begun to be completed. Dasya is on the verge of fullness, the ego remaining only in the sakshi and in some emotional remnants; the rest of the individual being lives now a secondary life as a conscious becoming of the one Being. Raudrananda, ahaituka & sukshma (materialised), has for some time been established in the system; vishayananda today has received similar rights in the physical body & vaidyuta is beginning to be regularised, although at present it is more often negative than positive. The five sharira anandas now usually occur together, involved in the main bliss-touch or explicit & accompanying it; this concomitance, however, is not invariable. Premananda is once more generally active & in individual touches intense. Subjective vishayananda is shaking off its occasional obscurations. Sraddha has once more been firmly established even for the sceptical intellectuality in the whole range of the siddhi except karma; there the sraddha is still [not] vijnanamaya & questioned by the surviving intellectual activities. The sraddha of rapidity is not yet similarly extensive. During the evening & night there was a cessation of the sid- dhi; the vijnana, the Mahakali tapas etc were kept in abeyance, the kamananda suspended. Only samata & the fullness of the first chatusthaya, especially of anandamaya nati remained.

This state of realisation, however, can only be final if it persists when the Mahakali tapas is active. The Ananda of cold is being increased by repeated & contin- ued exposure to cold wind with the bare body. Only an almost subliminal part of the nervous system persists in the sanskara of discomfort & the reaction of rheum in the nose. This rheum just succeeds, so far, in materialising itself, but is unable to lay hold on the system. The discomfort of exposure to solar heat is also sinking down towards the subliminal Prakriti. Kamananda today, though intense at times, was much inter- rupted. Akasha rupa & samadhi steadily increase. Dec 16 The condition of the last two days has fulfilled its purpose of establishing firmly the anandamaya nati; all adverse move- ments are now recognised throughout the whole nature as the divine will and accepted with negative, when not with positive, ananda; their purpose is perceived or, when not perceived, taken for granted. Disappointment & despondency, when they offer themselves, are immediately or almost immediately rejected. These conditions persist even though the Mahakali tapas has been re- manifested even though with small intensity. The Mahasaraswati nature with the Mahakali tapas has accepted entirely the full dasya. Faith is now imposed on the intellect even in the saundarya- siddhi as the result of two or three slight but noticeable effects of the will on the body which establish in type the possibility &, to the reason arguing from experience, the divine intention of the siddhi.

The utthapana of the leg was abandoned after ten min- utes owing to unsatisfactory nature of the laghima and mahima, although it could have been continued longer. The full force of the Mahakali tapas & personality was allowed to take possession of the adhara in the evening, but as usual brought on activity of the lower tapas and reaction. Dec 17 Telepathy confirmed afresh today, but under circumstances which brought on a brief attack of the intellectuality. The transfer of the intellectuality in its remnants to the ideality, the regularisation of the higher ideality and the extension of the vijnana continued. The greater force of Mahakali tapas is being attempted & persisted in in spite of untoward results. Vividness & legibility of lipi is becoming more common. Akasha rupa of the vivid kinds usually now dwells a little in the akasha & often before the eyes before vanishing, but not yet long enough to constitute stability. Kamananda is persistent & often intense, but interrupted & seldom continuous. Health in all its parts is striving to get rid of the recurrent touches of fragmentary roga & where the recurrence is persistent & prolonged to reduce it to the fragmentary condition. Dec 18. The result of the last three days movement has been to transfer all the movements of mind normally to the ideality, to establish the truth (satyam) of all telepathies & arrange for the ritam, to increase the strength of the telepathic trikaldrishti & justify all movements of tejas & tapas as satyam, but not as ritam. The ritam is especially uncertain in essential trikaldrishti & this uncertainty leads to frequent relapse and an occasional & fragmentary play of the intellect.

This is the case even in the field of experiment & in the karma of life these defects are much more pronounced; there also the trikaldrishti is still rudimentary. As a result sraddha in the karmasiddhi has failed to establish itself. There is faith in the rapidity of the vijnanasiddhi, especially now that the rupa & samadhi grow with an increasing pressure on the objective akash & the physical system; faith in the physical siddhi, but not a settled faith in its rapidity; no faith, except the ideal sraddha, in the most important part of the karmasiddhi on which all the rest depends.

Utthapana of the left leg, horizontal, side position, fifteen minutes, with stress of ananima on the sinew kept out by the Will.

The attempt at finality of perfect samata & Mahakali tapas has failed once more. The sraddha established is once more interrupted and only fitfully recurrent. The combination of the ananda, samata & knowledge with the effective Mahakali tapas in the Mahakali-Mahasaraswati person- ality was again effected, but the Mahasaraswati element predomi- nates & the stronger movements of the tapas are only occasionally active.

Dec 22 d .. Monday. 1913. The 21 s . t . Dec marks the close of a period. The first chatusthaya, hitherto always subject to apparent & superficial relapse by adhya- ropa & intrusion of trouble, asamata & nirananda from outside, is now superior, by reason of the final repulsion of desire and recog- nition of the conditions of the Yoga, to these intrusions, although a minor adhyaropa is still possible. The second is firm, under the surface and often on the surface, in all except sraddha, firm in itself, but not complete in its range or all its circumstances. Sraddha in the Yoga siddhi has been accepted by the intellect, but not sraddha in the kriti. There the surviving intellectuality demands certain ob- jective proofs before assenting to the ideal faith as anything more than a possibility or probability justified by the general nature of past experience. The doubt resolves itself into a deficiency in the sraddha Bhagavati. The Allpowerful Master of the Yoga is accepted as the Master & Lover of the Jiva and there is faith in His grace for the Yoga, but not in His grace for the life, nor in His ritam, nor in His Adesha. For this reason the swashaktyam sraddha is also overcast by doubt and limited in its range, because it is thoroughly experienced and accepted that own-Power can do nothing without the divine sanction and grace. The third chatustaya is in all, but rupadrishti, so far established in self-expansive force & inevitabil- ity of self perfection that its entire fulfilment remains only a matter of time. Physical siddhi is moving towards that stage, but has not reached it. Brahmasiddhi is now deficient only in nityasmarana and"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"354 Record of Yoga depth. Karmasiddhi remains now as the sole nexus of the asiddhi. The third chatusthaya is chiefly advanced in vangmaya thought, in general jnana where jnana does not pass into telepathy (prakamya-vyapti). The main difficulty lies in the defects of the interpretative power, daksha & ketu, which, although transferred in type to the ideality whether of vijnanabuddhi or vijnana, alter- nates practically between vijnana, vijnanabuddhi and those parts of manasabuddhi which are either pseudo-intuitional in the nature of their activity or else attempt to preserve the fragments of the old intellectual reasoning or of the undercurrent of habitual mentality. This defect is now being steadily mended; ideal interpretation is being applied to the material of telepathy, lipi, rupa, samadhi etc; but until this process is complete, the positive defects of knowledge, as opposed to mere occasional inactivity, incompleteness or limi- tation of range, must continue. Meanwhile the range has begun to be extended. Occasional inactivity of knowledge will remain & be used for ananda & uddeshya, the purposes of life & the joy of life. Power acts with frequency, but not with full mastery; nevertheless it is now often rapid, instantaneous[,] effortless & persistent in its efficacy. Lipi is organising itself materially, but lacks habituality of vividness & spontaneous fullness in the akasha. Chitra & sthapatya of rupa is now almost perfect, the human figure, animal, landscape & group being rich, various & perfect in all; the isolated object or object group is still obstructed, but is moving towards the same variety & richness. Perfection is already not uncommon. Akasharupa is now persistent in manifestation, but cannot yet acquire a free stability. The vishayadrishtis have all an occasional perfect action, but are limited to a few habitual forms. Samadhi is still deficient in free combination and prolonged continuity of vision and experience. Kamananda is now fixed in the body as of frequent daily occur- rence, but only sometimes (on some days, that is to say) continuous or intense in its frequency. Ahaituka tivrananda has acquired a great intensity & some persistence; raudra has intensity. Vishaya & still more vaidyuta are only occasional & still imperfectly devel- oped.

Saundarya is successfully obstructed; it is only rudimentary in a few features & still subject in a few to successful positive reactions. Karma is established but of slow progress in Sahitya, Veda & Bhashatattwa; obstructed in dharma, rudimentary in kriti. The last three chatusthayas are in the state of sure foundation, unfulfilled superstructure. Kali and Krishna are manifest, but not in their full power and being, and because they are not manifest in a sufficiently full power and being, therefore kama and karma linger. The fourfold Brahman, on which that manifestation rests, is realised subjectively, but not yet, except initially, in its objective effects. Shuddhi, mukti, bhukti are perfect except in the body & except in a few subjective terms, eg the imperfect exclusion of the active mentality, & even in the body are approaching that critical point of their progress after which completion becomes not only possible but easy; but siddhi is still kept back in parts, although it has now begun its finalities. Dec 23 d .. The forward movement of trikaldrishti, yesterday & this morning, received its seal of final and speedy inevitability; the positive defects that remain are occasional overstress on a tele- pathic perception marring the satyam and imperfect light of detail and arrangement limiting the ritam. Nevertheless even in the unillumined secondhand perceptions of mind the ritam is at last prevailing and the satyam is now dominant. *Lipi. 1 Effective fertility of the lipi; delight: utility of the lipi to the trikaldrishti. In the drishtis full drishti of gandha is now accomplished, although still infrequent. Sparsha-drishti is strong, but not usu- ally sufficiently materialised except in minor touches, eg touch of sukshma winds, insects, etc. Since writing the above gandha has founded its frequency; at first taking advantage of slight unnotice- able or distant physical gandha it has emphasised for the indriya to a 1 The asterisk is Sri Aurobindos; its significance is not known.

Finally, it has established the pure sukshma gandha in intensity & frequency. Vishayananda is now finally generating itself subjectively in the minds reception of all actions, sights, sounds, touches etc, a few touches of pain & discomfort in the body alone resisting, and objectively in the physical response to all experiences. It is now manifest in the other ananda touches, raudra, tivra, kama, vaidyuta; it is becoming frequent by itself in touches which or- dinarily bring other anandas; but objectively, it is not yet usually either intense or prolonged in ahaituka touches. This defect has now begun to be remedied. In type it has already been remedied, and the movement has been extended by concentrated process to the positive vaidyutananda. Negative vaidyuta had already intensity and prolongation, though usually associated with raudra. It is now being manifested separately. Lipi sunlit tapas and tapatya. This has already (immediately after the lipi) been exemplified by certain movements of the aishwarya in which illumination of telepathy & trikaldrishti were perfectly combined with effective, though not immediately effective force of the will; both are still deficient in arrangement of ritam, but both work freely in particu- lar effect. The resistance to the aishwarya, though still offered and often with obstinacy, is much weaker & less effective than formerly. Rasadrishti is remanifesting combined usually with sparsha of the object, but as yet it is usually indistinct and insufficiently materialised. Shabda is also once more manifest, clear only in a few elementary sounds, strong but vague & remote in others, such as music, human voices etc. Neither has yet advanced beyond the stage arrived at long ago when these experiences were discontinued. Rasa subsequently manifested great intensity and persistence in the bitter and bitter sour; the other tastes appear from time to time but without intensity or persistence, usually imperfectly materialised. Madhura is still involved in the sthula touches. The siddhi descended again to the intellectuality to mould the"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 357 mental pratistha more entirely to the passive reception of the vi- jnanamaya movements. In these descents jnana tends to keep its force & accuracy, receptive telepathy persists and sraddha in the yogasiddhi along with a provisional faith in the karma, recently im- posed on the intellect. But trikaldrishti proper is much interrupted, & faith in the rapidity of the siddhi tends to be diminished, impaired or to disappear. Power increases without attaining at any time to definite mastery. Akasharupa cannot advance, being overmastered by the obstruction. Lipi grows in effective fertility, utility & just interpretation and is more often legible & vivid than before, but has not made the full material conquest of the Akasha. Samadhi keeps its gains, but fluctuates in its unestablished features. Dec 24 It is indicated that the chief defect of the tapas in the yogasiddhi is the use of the physical insistence of the Will which is now out of date, though not ineffective, where direct physical tapasya has not to be used. Most of the reaction of asiddhi comes from the use of this force. On the other hand in the karmasiddhi, it has a permanent part to play, although always a subordinate part. Yesterdays descent into the intellectuality gave an opportunity for an attack of the mortal mind which reproduced briefly & by a sort of violence certain features of the old asamata and duhkham connected with the asraddha. The effects were entirely physical and mechanical and had no psychological reality or importance or any just causality. They seem to be a physical adjunct always possible by mechanical revival of old sanskara when dwelling on the plane of mortal mind or in any condition exposed to shadows from the martya manas in the world. They are in the nature of the minor adhyaropa of the asiddhi to which the first chatusthaya is still liable. Rasadrishti continues to develop. Many tastes manifest, mostly on the verge of sufficient materialisation, some just over it, a few depending on some material help and masquing behind an eatable object of quite different taste, eg sour behind pungent, or the mem- ory of an eatable formerly eaten, either a little while ago or a few hours before or the last day. Sound quiescent since yesterday is"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"358 Record of Yoga again manifesting. The other drishtis are as yet stationary (touch) or imprisoned (satyarupa & hearing). As the result of the recent struggle correct trikaldrishti is begin- ning to manifest in the intellectual response to the veiled vijnana. Samadhi preserves its characteristics, but does not yet advance to a higher perfection. The satya of presentation is returning to the manasa swapna, but it still tends to reproduce more or less present personality & sanskara; occasionally however it is quite pure except for a feeble hardly noticeable touch of perversion. Today in the jagrat antardrishta the transfer of intellectual movements to the ideality has definitely begun. Throughout the rest of the day, there were constant attacks of asiddhi, but the relapse into the Mahasaraswati form of udasina ananda could not again be enforced. The siddhi here appears to be complete. The only positive damage done by the attack was a partial bringing back of touches of physical discomfort disturbing the ananda of the indriyas in all touches & all sounds & restoring certain old sanskaras of unpleasant shrillness in sound or of dissat- isfaction in the quality & effect of touch. The sensation however was confined to the physical organ & its nervous currents; the mind held its own. Dream was ineffective. Dec 25. In the morning the full siddhi reasserted itself. There is a prepa- ration, as was predicted yesterday in the lipi, for the transfer of the knowledge to a higher ideality by enforcing more perfectly on the mortal & finite mind the brihat & compelling it to see the truth behind all suggestions even those apparently the most false. Constantly the mind is illumined in all its perceptions except those of the trikaldrishti, where it is only sure that all its perceptions rep- resent actual truth of fact conveyed by prakamya vyapti, but cannot perceive consistently decisive event or true order. It is now being shown, more convincingly than before, that all false arrangements are true arrangements elsewhere, in other space or time or both, but here effective as only true type of a potential or actual possibility working as one of the forces of conscious knowledge in the world"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 359 which determine partially the actual event in its preparation, its intermediate effectuation or its decisive finality. But the mind still revolts against even the actual possibility being enforced on it as or even instead of the actuality. This demand still strives to disturb the ananda of struggle & defeat & victory proper to the Mahakali tapas and temperament. The tapas-siddhi, clouded and interrupted yesterday, again manifests in a series of aishwaryaprayogas (with vashita) in which there was no instance of failure, but always some element of re- sistance. There are three forms of resistance; 1, the will is exactly fulfilled in all its successive dictates, but there is an involved & concealed resistance not betrayed by any action or movement but obvious to the prakamya-vyapti which would or might have mani- fested itself if the action of the will had been farther pursued; 2, the will is fulfilled with a slight delay or a slight deflection of detail or both; 3, the will is fulfilled with a longer delay or a greater deflection of details or both, or with constant alternations of failure & success leading to an ultimate victory. If the will were jatavedas, attended with a constant & perfect knowledge or identical with knowledge in the divine identity of Chit-Tapas, these difficulties would not occur; but, before that consummation can be allowed, will force in mind has to be educated to the necessary force & firmness. First, eventual failure in the particular event has to be eliminated then failure in process, then limitation of success to the particular event & its extension to series of events constituting finally one grand result. The tapas siddhi shows signs of entering on a new stage. From the movements of this stage it is evident that there are four forms of arrangement of Chit-Tapas which enter into the eventuality of things; first; arrangement of potential possibilities and their event, proper to the imagination, which may be eventually fulfilled but usually are not, except in quite another space or time or under quite other circumstances; 2, arrangement of actual possibilities and their reasonable event, proper to the judgment & reasoning intelligence, which often are fulfilled, but quite as often frustrated by forces behind the scene or impossible to be properly estimated by logic & mental reason; 3, arrangement of actualities on the"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"360 Record of Yoga basis of actual forces in operation seen or unseen, perceptible by mind or inferable, proper to the telepathic & intuitional mind, vijnanabuddhi, which are usually fulfilled & always more or less, but need not be, or, if fulfilled, need not continue to be fulfilled; 4, arrangement of absolute actuality, proper to the pure vijnana, which is invariably fulfilled, being equivalent to the intentions of Fate and Providence. A great obstacle to the development of Power has been the desistence from its use when an event seemed fixed either in a favourable or hostile sense on the strength of the telepathic dristi or even of the reasoning perceptions. The latter difficulty is beginning to disappear with the transference of knowl- edge to the vijnanabuddhi, & the disappearance of the reasoning intellect, but the former persists & is likely to persist until the knowledge has been transferred from the intuitional mind to the pure vijnana. This is being done with jnana; it has yet to be done with trikaldrishti. Lipi satyatejas is being fulfilled. All the powers are gaining in strength; aishwarya with vashita, not invariably successful in event, yet succeeds now far oftener than it fails, at any rate in the sadhan- kshetra; ishita is less powerful, but exercises a visible pressure & often fulfils itself; aishwarya with ishita stands between the two in effectiveness; both aishwarya & [vashita] 2 have also a field of exercise involved in ishita. But ill-ordered as is still the action of the Power, it is now recognised as satyatejas, always either producing some kind of effect or motion, if not the exact effect intended, and, if not at the time, in the object, under the circumstances intended, then at another time or place, or in another object or under other circumstances. There is delay, there is deflection, there is even final frustration, but never entire inutility. The ritam yet remains to be brought into this disordered mass of satyam. Kamananda has been seeking for the last three days to impose itself on the body, not as a circumstance, but as a law of its activities. It is this afternoon stronger in essential continuity than it has been in the past. 2 MS ishita"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 361 Dec 26. The remnants of anritam are now being persistently attacked & dominated in the telepathy & telepathic trikaldrishti; often even the unillumined mental movements constitute perfect ritam not only in telepathy but in trikaldrishti & when they are not so, they are always a full satyam with an imperfect ritam, an arrangement struggling to be right & attaining a half rightness, not as before entirely confused. Power grows, the sraddha of perfect power is taking possession of the mentality and preparing the eventual ri- tam of the tapas. The object can now be forced very often to the action it never intended contrary to its actual intention and endeavour, but this in living beings is effected through the mind & temperament by introducing a minor, weaker or side impulse which triumphs over the major, main or dominant impulses. Hence, usually, a long resistance occurs before the action is effected and often the object succeeds in getting away from the field of the vashikarana. The Personality of the Ishwara & His relation with the Jiva are becoming more & more determined and frequent in action. Today there was a descent into the adhar of the Aniruddha-Balarama balakabhava, powerful in temperament & using life & action as a boys game, the seat being not as formerly the mind & buddhi, but the intuitional mind and the temperament. Kamananda is now in possession of the physical system so far as to make itself always felt either in intensity, in subdued action or in a suppressed action effective on the body in secondary sensation, so that the system is not allowed to forget the ananda or to imagine its essential absence. The Mahakali tapas has developed so far that now no defeat is taken as even temporarily final, except in temporary particulars, no nirananda is accepted, but at once converted wholly or partially into ananda, every suggestion of impossibility is rejected. Even the spirit of postponement of results is losing strength & the sraddha of immediate effect & rapidity is growing. These things, however, have not yet conquered the whole field, and a reserve still holds its own in the karma-sraddha & the sraddha of immediate actuality. After a prolonged struggle with the fragmentary elfin agencies"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"362 Record of Yoga of the Manoloka there was a fresh emergence of a more perfect ideality. Kamananda was almost entirely suspended as a result of phys- ical expenditure in the second half of the day; only the faintest form of its suppressed existence subsisted. Dec 27. Telepathic drishti aided by the intuition arranged a kind of trikaldrishti perfect in all but exact detail of perspective. A more settled ideality, intolerant of intellectual tapas and manasic stress, now holds all the forms and instruments of knowledge and is ex- tending itself to the Tapas. The mind in ketu is still active, but only for more perfect training in passive receptivity of the vijnana; this manasa ketu is almost entirely void of intellectuality, at most there is sometimes a vague involved reasoning in the perception or, more often, a fantasy of stress upon remote or frail possibilities not properly connected with the actualities of the life or its proper mass of creative effort & forecast. The transformation of this manasic perception is now one of the main movements of the siddhi. Kamananda is again recovering its force; tivrananda, for some time a little discouraged, is regularising its action and local arrange- ment; the rest are still irregular in their manifestation. Subjective ananda is being exposed to a revival of discomfort in its parts of physical nerve-organism, mainly in the sravana, in order that ananda even in the most effective forms of physical discomfort may be more firmly stamped on the nervous system, first psychi- cally, then physically. The doubt about the sukshma character of the gandhadrishti, the idea, that is to say, that the abnormal per- ception of objective scents was being mistaken for sukshmadrishti, revived, but has once more been removed by still more unmis- takable examples. The physical prakamya exists & will grow, but accounts for only a small part of the phenomena. Eg the smell of food at midnight, in a shut room, under the bed-clothes cannot be physical gandhadrishti. All the physical (ahaituka) anandas are now firm in the body; vaidyuta is still comparatively rare, vishaya seldom intense or pro- longed, but all five are repeatedly present, kama & tivra both"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 363 intense & prolonged, raudra sufficiently intense & somewhat pro- longed. Tivra is generalising itself locally, kamananda has begun the generalisation in type, raudra is normally general; none, however, at any time cover the whole surface of the body, but are localised in their particular contacts. Kama is most self-diffusive in its single touches. All are steadily increasing themselves & their hold on the sthula body. Telepathy is now entirely justified to the intellectual sraddha; it is seen now that every telepathic suggestion is true, all are being except for slight perversions correctly placed and only in their ex- aggeration by tapas into trikaldrishti is there any serious error or distortion. So also the wisdom & kalyanechcha of the Master of the Yoga are justified in every detail of priya apriya, mangala amangala, the exact use & intention even being now generally evident either vaguely or precisely to the mental perception aided by the ideality. The absolute power over the Yoga is also evident, but the absolute power over the world is still a matter of ideal faith &, to the mind, of inferential faith, not of intellectual pratyaksha. So also the personal Love (prema & not kama) is not entirely justified to the perceptive manas & the prana, although justified to the heart. In the evening a shroud was drawn over the siddhi which seemed in great parts of it to become inactive or ineffective. At the same time it was evident that a process of purification of the old ideas & sanskaras formed in the course of the sadhan & no longer suited to the actual state or future course of the siddhi was in process. Dec 28. Recently the lipi appeared “Do not judge by the telepathy”. This command to the nature is now being brought home to the mind by the continual demonstration of the uselessness of the telepathy unsupported by viveka & intuition for the decision of actual even- tualities.

But when it does so in intuitional mind, it assists the manasa ketu to make mistakes of overstress by accustoming it to expect such monitions usually & not exceptionally from prakamya vyapti, so that it comes to take any & every vyapti & prakamya as an indication of actual event, in which case it falls into numberless errors, or as at least possible or probable event, in which case it flounders amid a chaos of uncertainties. The mind is now convinced of the proper limitations of telepathy & the intuitional mind as it was formerly of the insufficiency, proper limitations in the past & future uselessness of the intellect. The telepathy is now beginning to work again in harmony with the pure vijnana, and, more important, the tapas of effectuality is beginning to distinguish itself from the tapas of knowledge, while at the same time looking forward to a higher fulfilment in which the two again become one. Forces are now perceived at work long before they are fulfilled and the old tendency to insist on their immediate or rapid fulfilment and in default of that satisfaction to dismiss the perception of them as error or the forces themselves as futile, is passing away. It is now seen that all forces are effectual and must produce their result; until that result is seen & deter- mined, they must not be dismissed from consideration, nor from use. The Will therefore is now working with this knowledge of the forces as its medium, making use of those that are favourable to its intention, discouraging those that are adverse. In this working it is generally successful, sooner or later, except when the object passes out of the field of operation & the idea or hope of bringing it back or distinguishing it if it returns is abandoned. The ritam or right working of the power is not yet advanced beyond its former stage of initial & inchoate development. It is also now seen by the duller parts of manas that a force which seems to be prevailing & its victory inevitable & intended, need not prevail at all; some other force may intervene or the will of God may strike the object and drive it towards other ends; the movement of the once dominant force then takes its place in the history of the total motion & final event as one of the forces of variation that modified or advanced the course of their fulfilment. The way is therefore clear for the"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 365 entire perception of Ananta Brahman (guna, constituent forces and determining force or will), for its union in the Sarvam Brahma with the Jnanam Brahma and for its perfection in the sarvam samam anandam Brahma. Vishayananda (ahaituka) now manifests sufficient intensity & continuity when it enters the physical system in company with the other physical anandas. When it comes by itself, involving in itself the others, it tends, if the intensity is too sthula or prolongs itself, to pass into the others, especially raudra and tivra. For the rest, this conjunction of all the anandas is intended as the normal state of ecstasy, except in its more particular movements of vishesha- radhas. Vishaya is in its nature a saumya ananda, the rest in their nature chanda anandas; hence states of chandata tend naturally to pass out of vishaya into its fiercer fellows. It is noticeable also that the other anandas obstructed or denied tend more & more, instead of at once extinguishing themselves in avyaktam, to pass into the raudra. This circumstance throws a considerable light on the true nature of pain. Sortilege.

O Agni (lord of divine Tapas) and Soma (lord of Ananda), hear perfectly my call, take joy in the things perfectly expressed in me, become Ananda to the giver (of the sacrifice of action). This expresses the next necessity of the sid- dhi. Hitherto the full Anandamay state (Soma) has been associated with shama; tapas has always brought either partial Ananda or disturbance. The siddhi is now ripe for the perfect combination. It is noticeable that the sortilege has for some time been illuminated by the pure vijnana; the lipi as yet is not free from the pursuit of the manasa ketu and has often to be interpreted through the vijnana- buddhi; this is still more the case with rupa. Now, however, the ideality is steadily pressing on all the instruments of knowledge to take them over into its own domain, swe dame. The lipi in the samadhi is still fragmentary except in rare short sentences, sometimes even incoherent in the single word. eg “In the bath of men voltithaire impressionably” where voltithaire rep- resents primarily Voltaires Theatre (dramas) and the expressions “in the bath”, “of men” “Voltaires theatre” “impressionably”,"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"366 Record of Yoga although separate, are run together as if forming one sentence. A less confused instance runs “demain matin (one of the illustrators in Paris ... country.” In jagrat samadhi antardrishta a series of clear and stable images have manifested, but they are all crude in nature and struggle out of the old long-standing obstruction and obscurity. A movement has now taken place which marks the final libera- tion of the jiva from the fragments of dwandwa ragadwesha in the outward world-consciousness (priya-apriya, mangala-amangala) by the disappearance of the kartavya-akartavya, aptavya-anap- tavya. These things exist in the knowledge, but no longer in the emotional consciousness. The shadow of the old touches will fall for some time on the outer jada prakriti, but they will not be accepted by the organised consciousness of the jiva. Universal ananda is now hampered only by deficient physical mukti. Clear & stable rupa is now establishing itself again with greater freedom in the Akasha, but as yet nothing entirely decisive has been attained. Perfect rupas are still transitory & rare, developed rare &, though not always transitory, fleeting in their momentary stability; in the stable forms the crude predominate & even the ghana is infrequent & less stable, nor are these stable crude forms plentiful in their variety. The resistance to tapas is becoming less prolonged, its success less successful. There are exceptions, but these are principally in par- ticular detail or to less constant aishwarya. Ishita is still insufficient. Will was successful in recalling lines of verse entirely forgotten. They welled up from passive or concealed memory immediately in answer to the touch after long vain striving by mental pressure. In the samadhi, as a result of ishita, the supreme type of image, eg a city on the hills, once more recurred, but the prolonged con- tinuous experience of these images and of continued movements & occurrences in the scene they represent, formerly not infrequent though imperfect either in prolongation or in continuity, do not yet recur. The type is still only a complete isolated incident in a limited scene rapidly represented or a momentary cinematographic glimpse on a more extended scale, eg a street and its movements etc."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 367 Dec 29. The Shakti is busy extending the subjective & pranic ananda in objective touches which are still discomfortable, eg heat in the entrails, nausea, tejas effective of discharge of purisha etc and purg- ing out all tendencies to return of asantosha in ill-effect. Increasing premananda, shuddha, chidghana ar e still debating the ground with the fragmentary relics of the lower jaghanya or bibhatsa virati; ahaituka is firm but sometimes touched by the clouding of the others. Tapas still grows in power, but its hold is still insufficient because not yet automatically effective, except occasionally; it is effective, usually, only by overcoming the resistance of the bh ́ umayi prakriti, a resistance which still fights, if no longer every inch of ground, yet all possible terrain and is still liable to revive even where it has been partially & seems to be entirely conquered. Its faculty of resistance is, however, visibly dwindling. The sthula human touch is today being felt in addition to other touches but still in an initial & sukshma form, although it has passed the stage when it could only be felt perfectly in the pranakosha & its effects alone reached the annakosha. Certain forms of the prana jagat, rain, cloud, insects, etc are nowadays once again commonly visible though still vague & more often seen in their image or chhaya than in their proper bodies. Shabdadrishti is still behindhand & remains except for an occasional elementary or distant sound in the avyakta. It is however tending to gain strength. Akasharupa laboured strongly to generalise itself; rupas seen in one form or state now tend more easily to be seen in others, eg, antardrishta jagrat in bahirdrishta, rupa on background in akasha & vice versa, & even swapna rupas in antardarshi jagrat, but this is as yet only after awakening & in the more ghana states of the antardrishta. Stability in the swapna rupas progresses by a gradual tendency. Very rich images, as in former times, now manifest in the mental akasha and half appear on the borders of the sthula. Swapnasamadhi is rich & varied. The chief activity of the siddhi is now to prepare the thirteenth siddhi in the adhara subjectively and physically; all that is deficient subjectively is the survival of certain old sanskaras of unalterable"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"368 Record of Yoga cause & effect, physical possibility & impossibility. These removed the physical siddhi will be facilitated. The other main activity is the manifestation of the personal Shaktis of the Alipur sadhana in the anandatattwa of the mind, the explanation & justification of many dubious features and abandoned assertions of that sadhana, the justification of the mental tejas against the mental inertia, the extension of the dasya by submission to those chosen & allowed by the Ishwara, the removal of the fragments of straining, desire, nirananda, doubt of siddhi etc in the jada prakriti. Dec. 30. The mental ideas & suggestions are now usually justified in their substance; but at the same time their wanderings from the ritam in time, place, patra & placement of circumstance are often so much exaggerated that the unaided mind stumbles & cannot get a fixed conviction. The sraddha in the guidance grows, however, firmer & firmer behind and even through the perplexity, for the vijnana constantly returns and lightens up what had been dark or confused. There is now no unfriendly struggle in the vijnana cha- tusthaya, but only the clashes that attend natural growth & progres- sive adjustment. The struggle is now keenest in health & ananda; utthapana is in abeyance. Occasionally karmasiddhi of sahitya & dharma is taken in hand, but the serious pursuit is deferred, till the vijnana is essentially perfected and the sraddha justified. A certain amount of physical siddhi (mainly arogya & general utthapana) is also essential before the karma can be powerfully pursued. For some time pure vijnana has been quiescent, vijnanabuddhi subordinately active & a free play given to the anandatattwa of the manas. The object & so far the result has been to secure entire passivity in the mental parts of the mortality, both knowledge & tejas and a purification of the jada nirananda. The jada Bharata stage has again been realised and emphasised. The Sat & Tapas of the manas has been manifested so far as they can be with a complete absence of initial vijnana, and it has been shown both how the thing to be manifested rises out of the indeterminate Sat, how the Tapas selects & moves towards mental vijnana, what place is filled by sraddha & asraddha, rajas & tamas & how the birth of"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 369 ananda & nirananda born of their play effects the dwandwas. The movement is now towards reactivity & fulfilment of vijnana. The preparation of the thirteenth siddhi continues. The attempt to rise out of the jada passivity resulted immedi- ately in a relapse of parts of the mortal mind into the old forms of te- jas & dwandwa and a struggle of these elements to force themselves again on the jada prakriti as the law of its activity. Although this endeavour has been repelled, it is only by a cessation of all activity to which the Vritras seek to bind the system. It is after a long time that this faculty of Vritra has been restored & enabled it to estop entirely both active knowledge & active ananda. The tapas has also tem- porarily drawn back into the old successfully resisted mental tapas. The indeterminate position continued through the rest of the day, prolonged by the jada tendency in the Manas to attempt its own fulfilment without referring always or being lifted up into the Vijnana. Dec 31. Tapas now fulfils itself with great frequency in a perfect man- ner, instantaneously or almost instantaneously, sometimes without use of force in the will or pressure on the object, sometimes with slight force or a little pressure. The old ineffectuality, however, remains in all its outward types & recurs sufficiently often; this ineffectuality is especially strong where an impetus has already been given to another action or there is a powerful adverse bent in the object or when the attention of the Asiddhi has been called to it by a success of the will. These, however, are only the survival of a habit in the physical parts of the swabhava in the Bhumayi Prakriti. Yesterday utthapana was resumed utthapana of the neck for half an hour without effort or difficulty and with only an ineffective & moderate an-anima. Today there came utthapana of both legs in the medial position for quarter of an hour, with difficulty because of defect of mahima which finally induced abandonment, although there were signs that the asiddhi would diminish if the attempt were prolonged. Afterwards the left leg was supported in the horizontal position (reclining on the side) for an hour by a perfectly sufficient laghima & mahima & at the end could have been maintained for"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"370 Record of Yoga an indefinitely longer period. The pain of the sinews peculiar to this position was recurrent, but had no longer its old force; never- theless it prevented the maintenance in a single position straight or crooked, change of position giving relief. Except when the mahima is withheld, the utthapana now can always be maintained owing to the great accomplished force of laghima in the body. An-anima is now the only substantial opponent. I t is noticeable that physical tapasya has been greatly diminished & seems on the point of aban- donment in favour of pure Tapas of willpower. The utthapana of the back & loins has, however, still to be tried; hitherto it has only once succeeded. The time for the horizontal position of the legs has not before been equalled, but the alteration of the method & the disappearance of true opposition is now the real siddhi, time only a test of its completeness or a circumstance. Vepathu remains, but it is now seen as the sign of a helpful agent which increases mahima & diminishes both muscular stress & muscular pain and strain; it is the sign of the pranashakti at work improving an unfit adhara. In the afternoon there was a strong effort to reidealise the whole consciousness as well as the activity which succeeded with the thought but only partially with the trikaldrishti. In the evening there was, after a short struggle in which the trikaldrishti was al- most unerring but the tapas only partially & defensively effective, an unprecedented sequent faultlessness of the effective will and, with one or two slight deflections, of the perceptive knowledge, but all this was in the manasa ketu and not in the daivya. So far it was a success for the manasa element which seeks to use the vijnana for its own development while refusing to the vijnana the possession & enjoyment of the system. The results however failed to give satisfaction to the Jiva or to the system which now demands vijnana and rejects the manasa perceptions whether true or false. This virati is the security that the attempt of the lower to use & dominate the higher cannot eventually succeed. In the night for the first time there was entire success of the stability of rupa in the swapna samadhi, one scene, a street & the exterior of a house & its environment, lasting in spite of attempts of the asiddhi for many seconds before first one or two details became inconstant and then a swift shifting series of similar scenes"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 371 was substituted for the one stable scene. Like the vision of the city on the hill some days ago, this was an unique instance & a success only in type, but it is an assurance of success in the near future. Utthapana of the right leg, horizontal position, recumbent on the back, could be maintained only for 9 or 10 minutes; the ananima was strong & the mahima, though present, defective. The principal work of the [year] 1913 has been the reduction of asiddhi to a survival in the external environmental swabhava, the purification of that swabhava from the contradictions of the first & second chatusthayas, the sure foundation of the siddhi in the third, fourth & sixth & its preparation in the fifth. The finality of the first chatusthaya is perfect in itself, though not yet entirely absolute, touches still surviving as an occasional insistence from the outer nature. Fierce trouble & distress is obsolete, distress itself & even impatience only an occasional & momentary memorial return, but temporary discouragement & distrust with a tendency to indif- ference & weariness are still able to make a superficial impression. This insecurity of the sraddha & tejas & their incomplete hold in regard to the karmasiddhi & the necessary rapidity of Yogasiddhi prevents a complete & forcible finality of the shakti, retains the excess of the Mahasaraswati-Maheswari combination in the Ma- hakali Mahasaraswati temperament and hampers the expression & activity of the Mahakali tapas. The third chatusthaya is founded in all its parts, but insecure in the jnana, unfinished in the trikaldrishti, wide & secure but still uncertain & variable in vyaptiprakamya, both imperfect & uncertain in the parts of Tapas and ill-developed in samadhi; nevertheless it is now powerfully & inevitably progres- sive. The fourth chatusthaya is somewhat advanced but insecure in physical ananda, growing persistently in arogya but obstinately haunted by the old mechanical recurrence of fragmentary defects, growing in secondary utthapana, merely initial & without force of progression in saundarya. The fifth is still in a state of prepa- ration, seed-sowing & crude initial consistencies. The sixth is well advanced, but unable to hold its own without smarana except in the sarvam Brahma. The seventh is well advanced except in certain parts of the siddhi, especially in ritam."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"372 1914. January.

The day was chiefly occupied with the struggle of the manasa- ketu to survive as an active factor in the consciousness instead of a passive unreacting recipient. At first, all the justifications that could still be advanced for its survival had to be allowed to rise in order that they might be refuted & destroyed. Subsequently, the manasa element in the tapas had to be rejected. As a result the action of the Mahakali tapas has been cleared of its besetting difficulty and a coordination of vijnanamaya knowledge and vi- jnanamaya tapas is being prepared. The manasaketu remains as an otiose but habitually recurring survival which cannot yet be entirely expelled. Kamananda again became active; ahaituka tivrananda showed in its recurrence a considerable increase of generality and of force. The pure unaccompanied or unaided ahaituka vishaya is slowly emerging, but still usually stifled by the other anandas. Stability is growing firmer in the rupas of the swapna samadhi. Jan 2. The pure vijnanamaya trikaldrishti is once more disengaging itself from the telepathic basis over which it has to stand. Revelation & inspiration (drishti sruti) now take a leading part in the vijnana and intuition & viveka (smriti) are subordinate & secondary to them. The struggle is now definitely proceeding between the new tapas & the old prakriti for the expulsion of those elements which insist on the old slow & meticulous progress & prevent great results & rapid effectivity."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 373 The vijnana gained throughout the day and finally reestab- lished the decisive general trikaldrishti which selects discrimina- tively the right event out of several telepathic perceptions of the actual forces at work, their varying strengths and possible eventu- alities. At the same time the aishwarya & vashita recovered and, especially the former, increased their dominance over the objects of the Bhumaya Akasha. Hitherto aishwarya has usually had to take the help of vashita; this dependence is now disappearing. Ishita is still slow & uncertain in its results. The freedom of crude akasharupa greatly increased, & the tendency to take the use of the pranic pressure on the akasha in determining them has now taken a secondary place. More & more it is the pure mind that determines successfully results in the objective existence. For the rest this is the lipi that has already been given, “Subject control & perfect objects.” Dasya & tapas, samata and aishwarya are now being more successfully & perfectly combined in the total swabhava. Jan 3. Above the discriminative (vivekamaya) & intuitional trikal- drishti the revelatory trikaldrishti is remanifesting itself. The man- asic perceptions are now being used in their very confusion for the assertion of the liberty of this revelatory knowledge and its disregard of the false limitations of present and outward appear- ances. The same liberty is being asserted also for the Will and its instruments. The ananda of temporary defeat & the perception of Gods purpose in it is now being finally imposed on the rebellious pranic element in the outer swabhava. This perception precludes the conception of ultimate defeat for the Jiva, there can be no ultimate defeat except where Gods will & mans are at variance. The utility of the recent relapse & crisis now appears; the transfer of the intellectuality to the ideality had been burdened by the continued activity of manasa ketu and the supporting idea of the anandamaya pranic manas that the fulfilment of this infallible manasic activity using the vijnana as a referee was a main part of the siddhi. The main chaitanya had to come back into the manas in order to con- vince them, first, that the mind cannot be infallible except as a"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"374 Record of Yoga mere echo of the manifest or veiled vijnana and, secondly, that this fulfilment of an echo could not be the main intention of the Yoga. The aishwarya-vashita which triumphs over the fixed intention of the object is now manifesting clearly & powerfully. Shabdadrishti of the daivya turi (horn), indicating victory, & subsequently of divine music, first heard (with long continuity) only in the left ear when closed by the hand to earthly shabda, but afterwards when the hand was removed. The whole sukshmabodha is now extending its sense-perceptions to the mental & pranic heav- ens as well as to the mental & pranic koshas of the material world. This movement initiates the completion of the trailokyadrishti first indicated in the Alipur jail. It marks also the growing emergence of the sukshma shabdadrishti in the sthula hearing. In the tapas the mental energies of will at the side which were formerly confused by the mental tejas with the energies of knowl- edge, are now being devoted to their proper object, the development of vashita; aishwarya, vashita, ishita properly divided & combined are preparing the fullness of the Tapas. Jan 4. Sunday. Stability of the rupa background & continuity of a single com- plete event on the stable background seem now to be confirmed in the swapna samadhi & are seeking to extend themselves to the antardrishta jagrat; but transient scenes & figures still predominate in the swapna, while the stability in the jagrat lacks freedom and perfection. Kamananda is now well assured; nothing is able to break down its daily frequent manifestation and its tendency to persis- tence which promises before long to be victorious. Sparshadrishti hitherto confined to touches is adding continuity to frequency. Shabdadrishti also last night suddenly manifested in one sound, (flute-whistle,) an absolute clearness, vividness & continuity near the ear but entirely in the sthula akasha. Hitherto, however, this is an isolated incident. The Shakti is now bringing forward the ishita, ishita-vashita & effective vyapti and it is immediately found that in actual inherent power, vaja, all these are as strong as the other parts of tapas, but owing to the akasha being less habituated to their impact not so"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 375 readily or accurately effective as the vashita, aishwarya-vashita or even the pure aishwarya. Nevertheless the accuracy & readiness are already prepared and glimpsed in the action; they will soon develop in the mobile actuality. The vijnanabuddhi is now acting with full brihat of satyam and the incipient brihat of ritam taking up all the obscure or half illumined movements of the manasaketu & putting them in their place even in the trikaladrishti; this movement covers the perception & vangmaya thought and the script. The vani is now anandamaya, but like the pure vijnana it works either in the manasaketu or in the vijnanabuddhi after traversing to the consciousness the Sat, Tapas & ananda of the manas tattwa. This movement often wakes a transient pain of dissatisfaction in the mortal mind of the outer swabhava, but that habitual reaction is being removed. The higher anandamaya vani has once more manifested, de- ploying and overpowering the old sanskaras which hampered its fullness and possession, personality and delight. It is not yet settled in possession of the whole vani. In the swapna samadhi large combined images like the city are now occurring and appear also dimly in the antardrishta jagrat, but as they pass the borders between the swapna and antardrishta, tend to disappear or fade into a more unsubstantial dimness. Jan 5 The struggle over the ritam and the finality of the vijnana and ananda continues. The manas tattwa struggles, successfully so far, for survival and seizes hold of its own errors to discredit the vijnana & justify its own survival as a means for judging the vijnana. Health is once more strongly attacked, even cold and fever being threatened. The combination of dasatya & tapas continues to progress with the growth of the bhagavati sraddha. Jan 6 The struggle over the arogya continues, the symptoms of fever & cold spending themselves in the sukshma parts without being able to materialise firmly in the body in spite of the opportunities given.

The whole psychic mechanism of illness is now evident to the understanding. Full light and ananda are being steadily combined, but their arrangement is hampered by the imperfect finality of the decisive or higher trikaldrishti which is largely held in abeyance. Meanwhile the sraddha in Yogasiddhi & in the guidance & kalyana of the Master of the Yoga has been firmly generalised, and the recurrence of touches of distress & disheartenment are becoming more & more fragile & momentary. Faith in rapidity & adeshasiddhi is still withheld from the manasaketu which only admits them by an indirect & wavering deduction. For this reason the tapas is unable to maintain ugrata & swiftness. Jan 7 Mainly occupied with the struggle in the body over the arogya. Jan 8 During the last two or three days samata & ananda have un- dergone a prolonged ordeal. Titiksha is absolutely firm except for slight & momentary failings in the body, udasinata & nati equally firm except for similar slight failings, a little more pronounced in the body than the failures of titiksha; sama ananda is firm in the core & the mass of the chaitanya, less firm on the surface, but its failings are now negative & do not, except in a very slight degree, amount to positive distress or even, to a sensible extent, to positive discomfort, except in the body where suffering still has its hold. It is on this point that the bodily attack has been principally determined. In certain points the attack has failed; the fragments of the tendency to slight itch & eruption after showing a false activity have retired weakened, the attempt to reestablish cold & fever has so far failed, but disorder of the assimilative functions amounting to flatulence, dull pain & heaviness in the region of the liver, & looseness of purisha, but not di arrhoea, has again appeared, con- tradicting the temporary siddhi of arogya which had exiled all pain & positive disorder, leaving only discomfort of ill-regulated apana"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"22 December 1913–15 January 1914 377 and unrealised tendencies of alternate constipation & looseness. It is found, however, that the body has learned to retain its vital force & working energy, recovering elastically even from the brief after result of fever in the pranakosha. Kamananda continues obstinately though as yet unable to establish uninterrupted continuity in the body. The other physical anandas are occasional; tivra continues to grow in intensity and spontaneity. Subjective ananda is now seated & complete, including sakama prema. Hitherto the univer- sal prema even when directed towards the material form was in the heart only; it has now extended to the whole system including the body. However the kamic element is not yet always automatically present. Vijnana has been dull and clouded for the last two or three days. Sraddha in the guidance remains firm, though sometimes darkened & bewildered in knowledge; sraddha in the Yogasiddhi persists against all attack. The sahityasiddhi (Veda, Bhashatattwa, Darshana) is now growing in steady working & with it the sraddha in this part of the karma; but the sraddha in the rest still awaits ob- jective proof for its entire stability & is distrustful of the proposed extent of the karma. At night dream became, for the most part, entirely coherent and at times identical with swapna samadhi in its chhayamaya movements. Swapnasamadhi also in its chhayamaya movement initiated long & coherent continuity & a greater stability of forms. These movements were repeated frequently & for a long time, fluctuating between the two conditions of dream and vision. At the end in the deeper tamomaya nidra the old incoherence of the lower fragmentary mind dominated by present impressions & associa- tions reasserted its presence, but, although it persists, its hold and potency is greatly weakened. Jan 9. The attack on the health is steadily weakening and vijnana reasserting its activity, not yet the pure vijnana, but the vijnana- buddhi, even in trikaldrishti. It takes, assumes to itself, explains and often distinguishes in eventuality the perceptions of the man- asaketu, which, as a consequence, is now working more passively & with less selfwill and obstinacy. Distress continues to fade steadily"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"378 Record of Yoga out of the conscious experience even in the outer nature; distrust & discouragement still recur. Subsequently, the higher tapas of the mind, first sakama, then indifferent, then anandamaya emerged again after long struggle, failure & eclipse. It is now the tapas of Sacchidan[an]da in the mind, although it still awakens usually the tapas of the mortal mind as its accompaniment or medium of manifestation or partially effective agent. To get rid of the agent it is necessary first to perfect it as a medium and passive channel of communication for the daivya tapas working on the world. It must for that purpose become entirely sanmaya (shanta) & anandamaya without losing its chinmaya & tapomaya activity. Cold failed to reassert itself; but the fragmentary skin affec- tation has once more manifested. The struggle continues in the assimilation, etc. Jan 10. The Tapas has at last effected firmly its combination with dasya, although the dasyabuddhi is not always at the surface of the consciousness in its action; it has now to be combined perfectly with sraddha. For that purpose the vijnana is once more becoming active in the vijnanabuddhi governed and informed by the pure vijnana. The telepathic mind or manasaketu is being trained not only to recognise the satyam in the telepathies it receives (when the buddhi is active, it is now only a few suggestions the justi- fication of which cannot be eventually perceived or is wrongly placed), but to distinguish immediately the ritam and anritam.

Distrust remains in its usual field, rapidity & adeshasiddhi, but the latter is now centred in the kriti from which by an inferential process it returns on the other parts of the karma. Once exiled thence by objective proof, its hold will be finally & effectually destroyed. There is the attempt now firmly to establish the ugrata & shaurya, to banish the last traces of the dependence on fruits, pha- lahetu not the phalakanksha which is already disappearing while preserving the lipsa and the kaushalam, the one to be established free from kama, the other to be used when the perfected tapas is ready. The activity of the vijnana has revived, but is not yet universal or firmly stable. The other siddhis are mostly preparing behind the veil of Night. The nature of the difficulty in telepathy, the mutual confusion of the retrospective, prospective, near present & distant present in addition to errors of placement in p ́ atra, desha, kala etc is now being fully displayed & worked out without disturbing the sraddha of Yogatattwa & Yogasiddhi.

The rupa, apart from image, is confined to a few forms already familiar to the eye, rain etc. Touch has not yet passed beyond its former limits although it is more common & spontaneous; but taste & smell are increasing in force & frequency, especially in the sadharadrishti, eg the violent, intense, almost acridly intense & long continued taste in the mouth of the sweetness of sugar or molasses after the first puff of a cigarette, the smell amounting to nasikya aswada of the same sweet substance in the end of a cigarette thrown aside & smoking itself out, smell of strong perfumes etc on the basis of an unperfumed object or a slightly perfumed object at a great distance. The taste of madhura rasa is now well established."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"380 Record of Yoga All ordinary discomfort has now been invested with the ananda. Only the strong touches of pain remain to be conquered. Here dull pain even if strong & persistent offers little difficulty; acute pain beyond a certain degree still exceeds the titiksha & therefore passes beyond the scale of ananda. Sahityasiddhi has for some time been developing, tamasi, and is now coming forward. For some days the work at the Veda has been continuing with great force & persistence & overcoming the tamasic reactions, even the bodily, which used formerly to hamper long continued intensity of labour. The brain still becomes a little dull at times, but usually recovers itself rapidly & is always capable at its worst of an intermittent luminosity. Jan 15 The siddhi of the last few days has been directed mainly to- wards the removal in the natural mind of the obstacles to the right activity of the vijnana especially in trikaldrishti & the preparation of the general effective vijnanamaya tapas. The vijnanamaya ac- tion in the buddhi is now generalised, tending always, except for short intervals of relapse, to take the place of manasic perception, and by its very activity diminishing steadily, though it has not yet removed, the persistent recurrence of the manasic false response and distortion of vijnanamaya messages. In the light of this self- perfecting jnana all the past vicissitudes of the sadhana are seen in their right light, their reasons, necessity, utility, essential cause & teleological purpose; for better impression on the natural mind, they recur in slight & fleeting instances, repeat their old action[,] are understood and dissolve themselves. This process, perfected in the jnana, is being applied more & more powerfully & steadily to Veda, sahitya, trikaldrishti, telepathy. The mechanism of the tapas, its defects, causes, working & the teleological purpose of the defects arising from their essential causes, is also being exposed, the first effect being to remove the last remaining obstacles to faultless subjective persistence in the tapas even when it fails & is or seems hopeless of its purpose (the objective persistence is limited by physical fatigue or incapacity), and, secondly, to the ugrata of the tapas.

The failure, however, was due to the immixture of effort & desire & anishata generally & the mental nature of the tapas and these again to the necessities, essential & teleological, of the process of the transition from the mental to the ideal being. The second chatusthaya is, therefore, nearing full completion, the third preparing it; the first now only suffers momentarily in samata by passing depressions & in ananda by general limitation of the second; the third is delayed by insufficiency of tapas in the second, the second held back in sraddha & tapas by insufficient light & effectuality in the third. These two chatusthayas must therefore for a little time longer move forward together helping each others fullness until the still watching intellect in the outer nature is sufficiently assured of its ground to allow fullness of tapas & sraddha. Samadhi has not moved forward except in the fullness & comparative frequency of the spontaneous sukshma ghrana & the increasing tendency of the other sukshma indriyas. The rupa drishti still struggles with the opposition in the material akasha to its combined perfection & stability; both perfection & stability have been carried separately in the jagrat to a high efficiency, but they cannot yet combine their forces. There are occasional images in which they meet, eg the reel of cotton thread, (1 st degree), the card of d[itt]o (3 d degree), the playing card in the ghana & developed forms (2 d degree of stability); but this combined siddhi cannot yet generalise itself or even establish either frequency in the habitual forms or an initial freedom & variety of the higher forms. It is only in the crude forms that there is an initial freedom & variety accompanied with some stability. The physical siddhi has been for some time badly afflicted & depressed; the signs of progress are more subliminal than supraliminal. Karmasiddhi progresses rapidly in sahitya where the body alone is now a real obstacle, but is obstructed or attacked in dharma & kriti; especially in the latter there is violent negation & menace of destruction, eg, in the therapeutic pressure on N.

Script Resumption of script yesterday. First movements unsatisfac- tory & repetition of old false & trivial script, finally there came a movement that started from the best of the old script & passed beyond it; the mind tried to control but was outrun & seemed evidently in communication with another mind that did not depend on it for the suggestion of thought or even entirely of vak. Telepathic Trikaldrishti 2 typical instances 1. A crow seated on iron support of balcony; pranic impulse seen to be flight downward in a given direction, resisted by tamasic hesitation of mind and body. Trikaldrishti that in spite of all de- lay & resistance the contemplated movement would be executed. Doubt due to perception of adverse influences & tendencies, move- ment of bird away from line, arrival of finch tending to alter thought & standing partly in the line marked; still persistent af- firmation. Ultimately the movement foreseen effected. Subsequent movements of both birds correctly seen but with errors of exact line of flight; general directions & turns correctly pre-indicated. This, however, is now very common. It is exactitude & freedom from error due to false stress & overdefinition of subordinate or understatement of definitive force, intention or tendency that have to be secured. 2. A shabby boy in a splendid & richly varnished Victoria push-push. Doubt whether he was not coachmans boy put up in carriage.

Went to verify. The carriage stopped opposite Vs house & the boy went in leaving the coachman to follow. The theory that all is satyam & error comes from false stress, false valuation & false application by the mind is now established.

The old power of receiving the emotional & sense idea content of others minds is now active; the vyapti prakamya of formed thought is still infrequent, doubtful or sluggish, or when none of these, then insufficiently precise.

Tuesday The Lipi Tuesday, (14 th March) is to some extent justified, as today the ritam in the jnana seems to be firmly founded in the vijnana-buddhi by a[n] affirmative and discriminative action of the higher vijnana on the fallible mind. An attempt is being made to extend this advance to the trikaldrishti which is not yet entirely successful, as the overstress of the telepathic drishti con- tinues in the environmental nature & prevents accuracy at the centre. Nevertheless the ritam is becoming remarkably powerful, even though unequal & false in its mental incidence in the trikal- drishti. Veda is now taking a clear form & the objections to it breaking down; the definite interpretation has begun. Kam ́ ananda, often obstructed and suspended, always re- turn[s]; ahaituka tivra has established itself as a recurrent intensity, like ahaituka kamananda; ahaituka rudra now promises to do the same. Rupa is infrequent & crude in the jagrat. Samadhi is still attempting to organise itself, but the definite movement has not taken place. Lipi, though easily active if supported by the will, is otherwise subject to fluctuations from a state of intense, free & rapid to a state of dull & infrequent activity, although chitra is always freer than akasha & hardly at all suspended, though its ease & frequency vary.

The trikaldrishti of eventual actuality is still obscured & successfully deflected or veiled by false suggestions except in the better moments of the sadhana. Today vijnana obscured. The illuminated action in Veda continues but is usually associ- ated with the written vak; the perceptional thought is still disputed by the intellect. In other words, the Sruti is effected, both in writing & thought, but the Drishti is yet inefficient.

The vijnana is being perfect[ed] in the physical, vital & mental worlds according to their characteristic differences; at present the mental knowledge is being idealised to perfection by the idealising (rendering perfectly & spontaneously true & lu- minous) of the sense perceptions, the pranic impulses, the bodily movements & all connected therewith.

The Anantam has also two bhavas one in which the Infinite Force acts as if it were a mechanical entity, knowledge standing back from it, the other in which Life Force & Knowledge act together & the Infinite Force is an intelligent or at least a conscious force. Hitherto the position of the Tapas has been that when strongly exerted, it has come to produce an effect against resistance, some- times the full effect, sometimes a partial effect, sometimes a modi- fied or temporary effect, sometimes a postponed effect, sometimes merely a struggle physical or mental towards the desired effect. In things physical & in things of the karma, the smaller effects are more common, full effect rare. When simply exerted, the force has often failed entirely, sometimes succeeded fully & at once, some- times partly or with resistance, sometimes for a time only wholly or partially; sometimes only by producing a tendency or mental movement. Now the simply exerted will is becoming more effec- tive, often perfectly effective, with no resistance or brief resistance or ineffective resistance. A month has been given in the trikaldrishti for the progress of this movement. In the trikaldrishti a qualified authority is now enjoyed by the lipi, the written script, the articulate thought, & from today by the Vani & the unwritten Script; the perceptive thought is struggling towards this authority, but still hampered by inert & by tapasic suggestions which overstress a perception or which overshoot their mark. Today a more powerful movement of the perceptive thought, more readily, widely & accurately perceptive of the complex truth of forces & their results. If this tendency prevails, the lipi “Tuesday” & its interpretation will be amply justified. In any case, the claim of the tapasic devatas to be rendered effective before the knowledge is effective as knowledge, is from today rejected. As yet knowledge & force cannot become identical.

Lipsa has been the excuse for this persistence & its distinction from Kama. But the lipsa must be a samalipsa ready entirely to take defeat as well as success and not choosing its will but leaving that to a higher Shakti than the Bhuvarmayi or manomayi. The whole trikaldrishti is still regulated by the idea of success & failure & therefore cannot free itself from overstress. The reason is that man is at present the Asura Rakshasa & seeks from the buddhi the satisfaction of the heart & senses. Therefore this particular nodus is so hard to unloose; because it is always this Asura Rakshasa who has to be liberated & fulfilled & the difficulty cannot be solved by casting him out & rising entirely into a higher principle. The Devasura variety of the Asura Rakshasa has to be established, not the pure Deva or even the pure Devasura. The crux is here, in the right solution of this complexity.

These powers were gained long ago, early in the Pondicherry stay, & to some extent always existed in an inchoate form as they exist probably in all men; but they had to be discontinued for a long time; now with the growth of the jnanam Brahma this difficulty is being overcome by the perception of the contents of the buddhi & the waves of idea that rise in it. This evening the old powers arose in a much more powerful & vivid form than before. This revival was heralded by a note in the lipi referring to the former intensity of the powers for a short period as between Bj & myself; but the full intention of the lipi was not understood; it was not realised that the revival of that intensity this very day was intended.

Trikaldrishti is now being developed on the principle of affir- mation, ie everything is accepted as a fact, only the precise incidence & value of the fact has to be disengaged from the rude & inaccu- rate impression on the sensational mind. The importance of the unfulfilled tendency, intention or impulse physical, vital, mental or supramental, conscious, subconsci ous or super-conscious, is being emphasised its indispensable importance both in determining the eventual action or result, in fixing its efficient value and chances of permanence or finality & in influencing future eventuality. It is now proved beyond doubt that the mental perception of these un- fulfilled energies is not an error, proved by the constant unexpected fulfilment of those that had been put aside as errors; the vulgar test of reality, viz bodily fulfilment, is no longer needed by the mind for sraddha. The perfect trikaldrishti of eventuality will, it is supposed, emerge out of this mahadbhava of the telepathic mind, by the freer play of the higher vijnana in its fourfold quality. At present it is the telepathic trikaldrishti that is active and this, though it has been proved capable of sustained, detailed & complex accuracy, is not firm, but easily descends from the correct appraisement of event & tendency, to a mere mahat perception of tendencies open to false stress & false selection of the event.

Dasya Tertiary Dasyabhava has now taken a new form & is being recon- stituted as obedience to the Master in the adhara, with Prakritic agencies as mere distributory functionaries of the Tapas of action & eventually of the Tapas of thought. Up till now the dasya was either obedience to a distant Master in the Cosmos or at least, when not distant external to the Adhara, & to Prakritic agencies who were often sahankara & opposed the direct command from the Master. Dasya was first primary, that is a free subjection of the Will on the basis of a potential independence, secondly, secondary, that is, a mechanical subjection of the adhara independent of the personal Will to the Prakriti, last, tertiary, a complete subjection, mechanical & volitional to the Ishwara with the Prakriti only as a channel or jada agent. The tertiary has also its three stages, one in which the volition was dominant in the consciousness not as free, but as accompanying & approving the movement which, though at first mechanically compulsory, might be suspended if the volition long opposed it, a second in which the Prakritic control was dominant though as a compelled & compulsory agent of a remote or veiled Ishwara and a third, now finally emerging, in which the assent of the Jiva is given compulsorily & independently of any freedom of choice in the Sakshi, the Prakriti is purely a jada channel & not an agent, & the compulsion from the Ishwara direct, omnipresent and immanent.

It might arrive at a sort of secondary ritam after a long struggle & development, but that is not now intended, although it must be done at a later stage of the human advance in this age. At present it must be confined only to those who are incapable of the primary vijnana action. Rupa Formerly all kinds of rupa used to be manifested spasmodi- cally, even to the most perfectly developed. That siddhi has by an increasing pressure of asiddhi been disintegrated in the jagrat, & has now to be reconstituted on a surer and more natural foundation. Rupa is of two kinds. (1) Seen in the personal consciousness as image of a remote reality either in the mental akashas or the physical (prana & anna) akashas. (2) Seen as actual form of things in the jagat or as linga image of the actual form or body. The first is of two kinds according to perfection of manifesta- tion (1) inchoate (2) complete of three according to fullness of material (1) crude consisting only of the crude material (saptarchi of Agni[)], ie. 1 prakasha. 2. fire. 3. vidyut or varna 4jyoti 5 tejas 6 dhuma. 7 chhaya.

The flight of kites & crows is constantly watched for the telepathy & trikaldrishti; therefore, the image of kite & crow are frequent; actual forms however, are more often of other birds not usually seen or watched. In the rupa of image, all is being rebuilt again in the attempt to evolve a habitual combination of perfect complete clear & de- veloped spontaneous form with a firm stability in the akash. For chitra rupas have now a confirmed perfection & stability, although all are not complete; the inchoate form still persists in cloud forms etc where the material is unstable, but even there the complete form is sufficiently frequent. Today rupas, individuals & groups, are occurring in the akasha which are complete but not clearcut, momentarily stable but not with a useful & durable stability. More- over they are all crude with the extreme crudity. Other rupas in the akasha are fleeting &, though clearcut, seldom complete. Clearcut & complete crude rupas of a dense or developed crudity occur, but are also fleeting. Here there is as yet nothing that can be called an assured advance, as all this has happened before, been exceeded & then again destroyed. In samadhi there is retrogression & an old oft-repeated process of laborious rebuilding, the articulate thought in the jagrat prolongs itself into the swapna or sushupta of the mind & attempts to evolve a savijnana samadhi full of perceptive & vangmaya savijnana thought, sight etc in place of the present savikalpa samadhi. In the process a shadow of the old discontinued savichara & savitarka movements tends to recur, but is rejected & has no power or vitality. Images occur which have a kind of broken continuity & show part of the scene vividly, eg objects & action, but not the actor; this continuity is sometimes of action & mental rupa after loss of the bodily drishti. Tivra & kama occur in samadhi & continue after waking. None of these are new circumstances. There is therefore as yet no real advance. The confusions of the savikalpa continue.

In the afternoon there was again an automatic recurrence of the confusion, ashanti & revolt of the last few days; it revived as a result of anritam in the savikalpa samadhi and persisted for some two hours or more while recurrent nirananda and sensitiveness to asiddhi & asatya and the absence of the assured & sunlit jnana have been left behind as a deposit of this thrice repeated disturbance. The anger & revolt of the Prakriti at any pronounced & successful disturbance of finality in the first chatusthaya are caused by a sense of the total externality and want of justification in this wanton movement. It is no longer asatyam or other asiddhi that is the true cause of the self-identification by the Jiva with this movement of revolt.

Nor does the Jiva at present wish to renounce the unfaith, owing to the persistent experience of self- delusion in the past & the determination not to be a willing party to self-delusion in the future.

The second movement is to develop behind the higher or intuitional ideality an assistant revelatory (highest) ideality on a larger scale than any that has yet been manifested. Both, however, are on the lower rather than on the higher levels of their respective planes. The difficulty now felt by the intellect with regard to the tapas, is why there should be insistence by the tapas on a movement not willed by God. So long as there is ignorance, the tapas may be exercised in the confidence that it is a means of Gods workings even when the event is to be the opposite of the result attempted; but in the present stage this rule no longer satisfies as a rule of action. It is evident that there is a movement towards the renunciation of preferential Tapas not in accordance with knowledge. It is not likely however that this movement will be seriously effective for some time to come. Still, from henceforth, intellectual tapas in action must be renounced, like intellectual tapas in knowledge. The vangmaya is now re-ascending to the inspirational form & it appears that it will act for some time indifferently in the higher & lower vijnanas & vijnana buddhi, but always with a tendency to finish rapidly its work in the vijnana buddhi & con- fine itself to the pure vijnana. A more general movement of the subjective thought-trikaldrishti is being attempted as opposed to the objective trikaldrishti which follows the movement of an ex- tant object or present event. In the former the difficulty of the intellectual belief is that there is no means of physical verification or contradiction except when it is applied to history or the past of living men; in the second the telepathic difficulty (of misplace- ment & overstress) is yet unannulled & really unconquered in the normal perception, even if partially dominated when the siddhi is active.

At the same time with the diminution of the intellectual tapas, the daivya tapas manifests more & more & introduces often the most sudden & decisive movements in the object of the will, eg.

The Anandamaya Lilamaya Saguna is now being established in the conscious observation of persons & objects, although the Anandamaya Saguna is the usual bodha & there is a tendency of relapse to the mere Jnanamaya Saguna, but this is comparatively rare. Anandamaya Saguna tends to be the assured level (sanu) of the Brahmadarshana from which there is a steady tendency to rise to the Lilamaya. Formerly the sense of the Lilamaya Krishna or Narayana used to blot out the Jiva and, also, it used to be isolated without the background & continent of the Sarva Brahman or the perva- sive content of the Sarva Ananta Jnana Brahman, it was divine Anandamaya personality concentrated in a single individual being.

Today, the aishwarya-ishita-vashita show a strong perfection which amounts in its best movements, & these are frequent, to a control only checked by a slight ineffective resistance or rather passive inertia & unwillingness in the material world. This is marked in the lipi by the figure sixty. Originally the values of the siddhi of power used to be 1, 6 & 10. Afterwards the lipi showed 20, 30 & 40. At 40, which is now tending to be the normal pitch, there is an ordinary effectiveness, subject to variations of completeness & definiteness, attended by a constant, but not ul- timately successful resistance. At 60 the resistance is only initial and not maintained. At 80 the resistance will be only a memory of iner- tia. At 100 there will be a complete mastery. Moreover this power is not confined to the joint action of aishwarya-ishita, aishwarya vashita or vashita-ishita, but is attaching itself to their separate action as well. The old levels of efficiency & dull resistance still con- tinue to manifest, especially in massed actions & in the resistance of finalities, but even here their strength is much diminished. Instances of swift & decisive siddhi are accumulating rapidly eg the rapid denouement of the Army crisis, the non-resistance of the Unionists in East Fife, the relaxation of the Ulster difficulty, the growth of the idea of Federal Home Rule, the South African solution, events in Bengal, tendencies in Pondicherry etc. Even in physical things the power increases, eg the stoppage of the disordered pipe twice in two minutes after it had been running persistently for three or four days & was at the moment in a violent state of disorder. Exact fulfilment also is now approaching the point of establishment. Today the Lilamaya Purusha is manifesting itself in the Lila- maya Saguna as the normal perception; the other still remains as the lower or foundational level to which the pratibodha goes back when it is not sam ́ ahita.

The Krishna-darshana is, in its turn, withdrawn. In the Darshana, however, Nara is prominent, Narayana in the background. As the vijnana began to remanifest & harmonise with the ugrata of the Mahakali bhava, the inimical forces made a violent attempt to bring back the nirananda & ashanti of the asiddha Kalibhava in the Prakriti; the attempt was partially successful in the outer layers of the personality & although rejected, returned. The harmony, therefore, of the first two chatusthayas has been tem- porarily disturbed, although not in the mass of the consciousness, but only on its outskirts. In fulfilment of 4 telepathy & telepathic trikaldrishti manifested with complete satyam & almost complete ritam for a while. The struggle continued till 2 in the afternoon.

The result is not yet the complete ritam, but a progressive liberation from the habit of dwelling on the telepathic perception of tendency & taking its demand & power of self-fulfilment for the eventual act. In a certain sense this is a recoil to a less advanced stage than had been reached a few days ago and has been necessitated by the fresh forces liberated by the dissolution of the Vayuputra. Kamananda continues to recover its former frequency & hold on the system, but is still held back by the pranic deficiencies which result in exhaustion & roga. The Brahmadarshan fluctuates between the Krishna, Krishna Narayana, Narayana, Nara Narayana, Nara in Saguna Brahman & mere Saguna bhavas.

In all cases, except in a few in which a moving object passed out of range before the will could be effective, the movement willed took place without resistance or after greater or less resistance. All three forms, vashita, aishwarya, ishita were tried; at first there was a difference, ishita seeming the least effective of the three, vashita most effective against active resistance, aishwarya against the passive obstruction of tamasic nature; but eventually all seemed to be equalised. Once, notably, aishwarya effected three successive exact & immediate movements in two flying birds with more than the sixtyfold power, but ishita also produced a similar result as well as one against resistance of the 50 value. Vashita also manifested the 50º, but not a higher value; that, however, it has done on previous occasions. All these effectivities were in particular movements and there does not seem to be yet the same effect upon persistent tendencies, established powers, material objects etc. Kamananda today recovered something of its power of pro- longed intensity & tendency to perpetuate itself in the system. At the same time subjective ananda is resuming its old intensities and attempting finally to get rid of the faint prano-manasic impressions of ugliness, unattractiveness etc which prevent the full & sama delight and are relics in the consciousness of mortal jugupsa.

Mahakalibhava and tertiary dasya of the body remained firm, but the first chatusthaya was touched with the external asamata, ashanti & even momentary duhkha. The Brahmadarshan wavers between the Anandamaya Purusha, Nara in the Anandamaya Sa- guna & the generalised Nara-Narayana. The sense of universal beauty has been successfully interrupted & denied in the Indriya, the face being as usual the fortress of the Asundara. There is also a continual driving down of the thought from the vijnana into the mind where it takes up the old forms of error. The reading of Rs [Richards] book “Les Dieux” has brought up the question of the Master & the Adesha, whether it is a God or God and the adesha an arbitrary impulsion or the voice of supreme Truth & Power.

Subsequently, the Master of the Yoga manifested as the vi- jnanasarathyupeta Rathi vidvan, the Deva, whose manifestation depends on the manifestation of the Devi; it therefore awaited the firm manifestation of the Mahakali personality before basing permanently in the vijnana its own manifestation.

This symbolises the present movement in the siddhi. In the afternoon as predicted siddhi has returned.

Ananda of battle & defeat established firmly in its generality, no longer in type or particular instance. Strong & continued oppressive pain between the lungs & navel as of approaching death, continued for nearly an hour. Borne at first with passive ananda, it became at last nirananda & had to be expelled by a constant pressure of the Will accompanied by rapid breathing and swallowing of amrita in the saliva. Not the element of pain, but the element of discomfort overpowered the ananda for the reason that the element of pain appeals only to the body & the mind can accept or reject it easily; but the element of discomfort working direct on the prana & obstructing it troubles the mind in prana & dissociation is less easy. April 14. Tuesday Power now is easily effective where the object is passive & not occupied by an opposite law of action; partially or ultimately effective where there is, to combat it, only an immediate intention or preoccupation (for it either changes or modifies the intention or acts when that is gone); slowly effective, & often after long continued failure, when there is, to combat it, a habit, trait of character or fixed & customary intention. It fails in immediate purpose when an active force works against it which is too strong & obstinate to be overpowered even after battle, because there is still in the nature the easygoing weakness of Mahasaraswati which is unwill- ing to face the necessity of ugrata & tapasya. It fails also as yet in changing easily fixed habits of working in the annamaya prakriti. The Ananda of battle has to be increased (this is the meaning of the lipi “battle” constantly given in the last few days) and the habit of physical weariness, lassitude & renunciation of effort eliminated. At the same time it is not the rajasic shakti which must dispel it, but the pure ugrapravritti of the trigunat ́ ıta shakti. Last night, the symbol rupa was shown in bahirdarshi of a red sun changing into a rosy sun followed by a blue-green sun, ie the ugrapravritti of Mahakali developing love (Mahalakshmi) and pouring itself into beneficence governed by spiritual temperament and knowledge (the Sun is always vijnana). Afterwards the universal"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"12 March–14 April 1914 443 prema settled itself in the system as a part of the temperament and the temper of doing all things as paropak ́ ara, even apparent injury being done for an ultimate good to the individual & the world. As the Ananda of defeat, of the asundara, of the ashiva is insisted on, there begins to be finally settled in the knowledge & mental consciousness a more luminous sense of the necessity & meaning of the adverse movements in the siddhi & the life. The whole environmental nature is therewith assuming a more perfect & all-pervading anandamaya nati to the Ishwara. Last night prayer, to which the nature has been long much opposed & then indifferent, was twice used to the Rudra-Vishnu as the helper & healer & yet the cause of the affliction. In the afternoon there was again trouble owing to the obstinate obstruction of the vijnana & the attempt of the unillumined pranic movements of knowledge in the environment to justify themselves without waiting for illumination. The process of conversion of all pranic movements into jyotirmaya movements (Agner bhrajante archayah) is covered & delayed by this obstruction; meanwhile the action of knowledge & power seems to be suspended or confused & fragmentary, as these elements of asiddhi are given free & continued play. It is true at the same time that deeper movements of trikal- drishti are being prepared & fragmentarily emerge, as tendencies reveal themselves which are frustrated at the moment but intended to be fulfilled in the future, sometimes the distant future. These movements, however, are at present either obscure or dhuminah not bhraja[n]tah. The Brahmadarshan has been interrupted in its higher parts in order, apparently, to extend the bodha of Narayana into the whole consciousness of the Nara instead of keeping it as a thing apart & containing & informing, but not identical with the Nara. In the descent there is a frequent relapse into the mere saguna. The whole consciousness has been driven down into the manas & prana, apparently in order that their more obscure movements may learn to become satyam, brihat & ritam no less in the Anna- maya & Pranamaya Purusha & Prakriti than in the Manomaya. It is promised that as a result of the apparent relapse a greater, firmer & vaster siddhi will emerge."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"444 15 APRIL–1 JUNE 1914 Record of Yoga April 15 th to 1914 April 15 t . h . Wednesday. Today the siddhi is beginning to reemerge decidedly from its obscuration. The same movement, however, continues. Mahakali personality & dasya resist all attempts at disturbance; but the former is diminished in force by being confined to personality and barred from control over the bhava and the action in which the other three vary their combinations. Prema & kama of Ma- hasaraswati (the Sudrani) generalise themselves more & more & with them grows the dasya to individuals arising out of the dasya to God as well as the general dasyalipsa. This is today confirmed in universal atmasamarpana. The Brahmanic basis of Maheswari grows in force with the growth of the third chatusthaya, but its harmony with the kshatratejas is disturbed by the obstruction to the Chandibhava and the force of divine Tapas. All the old har- monies have been disturbed to make place for a new & greater arrangement of the same rhythm. As always, there is in the process some disturbance of samata, sukham, pras ́ ada, but it is nothing compared with former disturbances; its movements are dull, brief & external, tamasic, not rajasic, of the nature of depression & [?weak] uneasiness with very little, if anything, of the nature of revolt.

Since the morning Sahitya has again revived and the “Life Divine”, long suspended owing to the confused & overcrowded action of the mental Sruti, has been resumed with a greater clear- ness & regular proportion in its argument. The physical lassitude & divided purpose still resist sustained writing. The action of the trikaldrishti on the pranic & manasic telepathies is now resuming its movement, but owing to the indecisive dimness of its illumination, a great delicacy of action is needed as the least overstress or understress falsifies or disturbs the arrangement of the details & may lead to a wrong ultimate conclusion.

Only, as the present Lila has to be changed, there is a double aspect of the Krishnadarshana, Krishna that is, seen in the adult, & Krishna that is to be, seen more readily in children & the young. In women it is the Kalidarshana that prevails. Power is now attempting to proceed from the experience of the 12 th &14 th to a more puissant action. It is seen today by experience that a powerful & persistent vashita will bring about results that to the telepathic vision of working forces seem im- possible, but there is a limit of effectiveness which the power is not yet able to overpass. It is suggested that the power now is in its use hampered by the Maheshwari-Mahasaraswati tem- perament of slow and regular unhasting pressure & has not yet sufficient ugrata in the asu poured into it. Mahasaraswatis habit of giving way to the immediate event or the most powerful pres- sure & going round the obstacle or slowly undermining it must be renounced for a more stern & direct pressure on the oppos- ing forces. This is supported by strong partial successes. On the other hand the opposite suggestion is that force is useless until the early forces have been slowly prepared for the higher vijnana to manifest.

It is the intellectuality in the telepathy that resists. ie the devatas who watch & are guided by immediate forces are unwilling to allow the force & the vision to go beyond them. They approve the siddhi of Maheshwari-Mahasaraswati, but are opposed to the siddhi of Mahakali-Mahasaraswati. The whole struggle in the siddhi now is between the present & the future, between the telepathic knowledge that sees & admits the present & the vijnanamaya that reaches beyond to the future, between the force that admits & manipulates present forces & the force that aims at annulling & replacing or transforming them rapidly into the image of their vijnanamaya & anandamaya equiv- alents, between the present NaraNarayana in men & the future Krishna who incarnated himself in Brindavana & Dwarka. After a farther brief struggle the Mahakali bhava & tapas, as well as the personality, have been finally accepted in the bauddha parts of the consciousness. They have now to be imposed on all the sensations & impulses without diminishing the completeness of the other three elements in the being. At the same time the entire & rapid idealisation of the lower consciousness has to be resumed. The Kamananda is still in the same uncertain condition wa- vering between cessation & continuance; but there are tendencies of advance in the physical ananda generally.

There was then a struggle between the Arogyashakti in the pranic system & the Roga from outside; the latter seeking by an appeal to the habitual memory in the bodily molecules to overpower the mind of the body & compel it to accept the “laws” of fever, the former refusing. Rice was eaten, the body exposed to draught; the fever ejected rapidly left behind it an intermittent heat, a sense of feverish pain in the back, though much more in the nervous body than in the physical, a trouble in that body & therefore a corresponding trouble i n the physical nervous system & a sense of weakness, as also a certain sensitiveness of the nerve- currents to cold.

For some time the Arogya- shakti has been busy dispelling one by one the old habitual & mechanical forms of roga which still survived as unreasoned recur- rences. The fever seems to be a revolt of the old physical nature intended for breaking down of the results obtained & the recovery of the system by the forces of disorder. The disorder in the subjective being has once more disappeared & universal ananda, including the ananda of battle & defeat, has remanifested itself; the object of particular asiddhis is also once more self-apparent. In the Tapas there has been a repeated effective Will for the favourable forces in the physical Swabhava to increase in strength. Formerly, these forces were sluggish & weak & to produce a decided result the will had to be constantly applied to the object & its movement, otherwise the result was either frustrated or manifested itself slowly, imperfectly or to other ultimate purposes than were intended. Now, the physical swabhava often takes up the will once cast out and carries it out suddenly, puissantly & with fixed determination. At other times, however, this force does not act or, after commencing action, flags and needs the support of a fresh application of the Vashita or Aishwarya. A great efflorescence of sthapatyadrishti, all sorts of human figures variously dressed, scenes, landscapes, fields, plains, hedges, trees, lakes, cities, birds, beasts etc being seen crowded in a small space of foliage. The figures of beasts were at first obstinately pre- vented from manifesting & are still in all forms of drishti less free & frequent than the others. Known figures & heads some- times occur, but known faces in detail are usually obstructed from manifesting except in the swapna samadhi & sometimes in the chitra.

Fever continues slightly, but there is vital force in the body maintaining itself & contradicted only when the tamas gets the upper hand or by a more rapid exhaustion than usual, but even that exhaustion is speedily repaired with a novel persistence & swiftness. There is no disposition in the pranakosha to yield to the fever & take to the bed. Rapid effectiveness in isolated aishwarya or vashita is be- coming more frequent. The trikaldrishti is acting mentally only & without sureness or illumination. The aishwarya or vashita is now more frequently assisted by an effective force in the material Prakriti. The trikaldrishti is now attempting to separate itself entirely from the telepathy & is so separated in bhava, but not yet entirely in practice. In the afternoon the fever after failing to master the body & fluctuating several times left control of the system. The pranakosha established hunger, vital energy etc even in the midst of the fever, but is still susceptible in the body to feverish heat & cold & to suggestions of weakness & limitation of energy by illness.

Persistent recurrence of Kamananda has surmounted all the old particular difficulties & has now only against it the general ahaituka difficulty of the former habit of non-occurrence or rather of suspended recurrence. Persistent continuity is not yet possible except for short periods. There is a struggle between the ascetic tendency which the cir- cumstances seem to demand & the Janaka ideal which has hitherto been imposed.

The ananda was at first not intense in the sthula body, only in the half-vyakta action of the pranakosha; & the capacity of the body to bear continual unintense pervading ananda was established. Now, while sitting, continuous intense ananda is being given, with dharanashakti behind in the mental body supporting the pranakosha in this activity. Thus, rapidly, the lipi “death of the difficulties” daily repeated (not recorded) is being fulfilled in this important siddhi by a sort of concentrated process emerging out of the most rapid gradual progress.

The former were at the centre of the action & personality, but are now displaced. In order to maintain or recover their hold, they have struggled to maintain the former gradual progress & favoured even relapse & obstruction as helpful to the retardation. As a result they see asiddhi & chaos threatening to establish themselves in the general failure of the Yoga. For this reason the principle of relapse has been allowed once again to become powerful in the subjective siddhi. Many of these parts are now repentant of their obstruction, others half-convinced, others uncertain & inclined to persevere. The general result has not been favourable to a rapid siddhi. In the vijnana, the intellect is now forced to a more general & unquestioning acceptance of the satyam & brihat in the knowledge & of the value of personal tapas as a force in the determination of results;but the knowledge has receded in ritam & the power in actual effectivity as a result of the violent & obstinate pres- sure of the anandamaya mental devatas of the Mahasaraswati Prakriti. Rupa advances slowly. There are now rare figures of all kinds of an initial stability that present themselves directly to the sthula vision; but for the most part the formlessness of the stable rupas (now even exaggerated) & the instability of formed rupas is still the rule of the jagrad drishti. In Samadhi the stability acquired is maintained but does not progress; swapna fluctuates between coherence & incoherence. In the physical siddhi kamananda continues to recur with a brief intensity, but its continuity is discontinued, in order, it is suggested, that the physical nature may now take it up & develop spontaneously its higher permanence.

For some time past there has been a fixed movement towards minimising evacuation, limited to twice in the day for the jala; for the other, there is no fixed time or proportion, but the movement is yet imperfect.

May 19 th The difficulty now felt with the vijnana is to raise the mind out of the sphere of the vijnanabuddhi turned towards form of force & form of matter & their movements. The Tapas cannot be easily effective because in the realm of nervous force every force put forward has a greater or less authority to persist &, if possible, conquer & every perception turns into a force which has a right to exert itself & persist. It is only by rising beyond to vijnana itself that the vijnanabuddhi can be liberated from the subservience to truth of possibility by freedom of ultimate law in the ritam. But there are two ritams, one that follows & adapts the possibilities, an- other that controls sovranly the possibilities & it depends on which plane the consciousness adopts whether the knowledge & power will be of the higher controlling kind or the lower self-adapting kind. The chief source of ashanti & asamata in their recurrence was hitherto the unilluminated action of the nervous force in battle with the resistance in the activity.

The vertical position of the arms, in the recumbent state of the body, which could formerly be continued for 3 hours without strain, except a slight & hardly appreciable reaction at the end, now resulted in a very appreciable strain at the end of half an hour. There is in other respects also a noticeable relapse in the physical shakti. As yet, the principle of relapse maintains itself everywhere; the second intimation of the 2 d May has not been fulfilled except that the relapse is no longer definitive, no part of the purely subjective siddhi being lost so that it has to be rebuilt, but only concealed so that it has to be remanifested. The Atris & Vrikas are no longer powerful, but the Coverers, Vritras, still retain their strength. In the less subjective parts of the vijnana, the Atris seem to persist, but they swallow without digesting & the siddhi eventually comes out again with a slight appearance of re-growth rather than of reconstruction. In the physical siddhi & the kriti the Vrikas seem yet to have power.

A period of progressive fulfilment has been indicated from day before yesterday. There are some signs of its fulfilment. The basis of the triloka has been formed. In the knowledge the mind perceives the forces of the bhuvar & is no longer easily led away by the tapasic stress; where there is error, it is more swift to correct it even before the event; where there is uncerta inty it is more willing to recognise it. There is a more illumined action of the mental telepathy. The decisive trikaldrishti reemerges & is more amply justified. Kamananda recovered & increased its persistence yesterday; it is once more attempting a continuous permanence. With the smarana it is usually active, except when the contrary nervous forces put out a strong effort to oppress it; its capacity for act- ing without the smarana is steadily increasing, but as yet it is not dominant. The main obstacle now to progress is the imperfection of that layer in the koshas of the being which represents the meeting-place of the prana & the anna in the most physical action of the former principle. This imperfection exaggerated not only insists on the habitual symptoms of roga, but it is a channel for the perpetu- ation of the previous habits of the mentality. It is aided by the tamasic ananda in the mind which enjoys & seeks to materialise all suggestions of inertia, defeat, collapse etc. Eg. it being noted that the tejasic difficulties of the assimilation could not reestablish themselves, this tamasic mentality at once sought to restore them & succeeded in rendering them once more active."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"15 April–1 June 1914 477 Lipis (1) 21.

The change to the rudra ananda of Mahakali is already being effected, organically & organised-ly it has extended itself to all experiences & activities, but is hampered by the sense of a discord & the discomfort of the discord. This discomfort can be well per- ceived as a form of ananda out of order & its source as the egoism of a standard erected by the individual mind and a demand that all should conform to it. The standard remains & the demand, but it must be the standard of Gods tendency & the demand of Gods tapas, so that the discord may also bring a joy of progressive fulfilment & of strenuousness in the progress, not the discomfort of a baffled struggle. The use of error is to suggest or to maintain a truth of being which would otherwise be shut out by the limited precision of the truth of actuality. What we call truth is always an equivalence between a partial truth of fact & the perception in the human mind. If too rigidly insisted upon it is itself an error, as if a tract of ground brilliantly lighted were to be taken for the whole earth & the vastnesses left in obscurity excluded as if they were non-existent. This rigidity is the ordinary method of truth-seekers. Necessary to the limited human mind, it yet prevents comprehensive vision.

Smarana is, temporarily, again a condition for continuity. The vijnana of knowledge progresses in the mass and through the mass the ritam is evolving, but when the mind concentrates on individual detail, the old disorder is apt to recur. This, however, is not invariable; for often in the individual detail there is correct order. But when the final result is forecast without a mental per- ception of the forces at work, there error in mind is more frequent than the correct reception of the truth from above.

Vijnana The Knowledge after attaining a fair amount of Ritam in the Satyam Brihat, gave place to an attempt to establish the Aishwarya- Vashita-Ishita in a greater mastery, but here the Tapas is only one force among many, sometimes prevailing or partly prevailing, sometimes or partly failing & the Knowledge falls back to that level & reflects the struggle of forces & no longer the vijnanamaya knowledge of its eventualities. It becomes again the satyam brihat without the ritam, especially if failure reawakens the old struggle between egoistic faith & rajasic revolt of disappointment.

The first thing done therefore was to make the eye glance back & fall on the previous “significant words” recorded. “Straining & anxiety must cease” & “Raw Material”, the latter explains the difficulties of the process which has led to the shadow of dissatisfaction & sollicitude. The eye then glanced back at all the sortileges recorded & at once reinforced the corresponding activities & judged their state of progress at the present moment. Afterwards it glanced first at the paper Mahratta opposite where it got the first “significant word” & secondly, into the commentary in verse on the Isha Upanishad where it got the second. The agreement of these two entirely unconnected sources taken at random, seen in the light of previous “coincidences” shows that these are not coincidences, but the combinations of an Intelligence for which no method is too small to bring about the greatest ends or too great to be used for bringing about the smallest.

Thou mayst miss by that neglect the little stone upon which rests all this mighty universe. Aishwarya There are still three movements in the effectivity of Tapas 1. The Tapas is successfully resisted by strong powers of ob- struction that are either in possession or take possession of the field of activity. The successes are then fragmentary & partial. 2. The Tapas acts resisted, but irresistible, in the power 60, sweeping away the resistance & realising an immediate success. This success may be either in one detail or in successive details but has not yet been generalised. 3. A mixed movement struggling towards general effectivity in which each act of tapas is satyam, but there is insufficient brihat and only a fragmentary ritam."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"10 June–29 September 1914 511 Script. The difficulties of the Vijnana ought not to discourage the Tapas. This is still the defect that the actuality of unsuccess brings unfaith not only in the immediate success but in the whole theory of the karma. The unfaith in Yoga siddhi is only a shadow; the unfaith in karma is still a reality. It has a liberal & ample ground of justifi- cation, but also good reasons for self-distrust. If the Yoga siddhi is entirely fulfilled, so will [be] the karma. The question then is of time, of power & of good faith on the part of the Master of the Lila. The doubt of good faith rests on the idea that this may be one of his deceptions by which he helps his purpose in the world, but deceives & breaks his instrument or satisfies his hopes only in a slight degree. The doubt of power rests on the idea that the Master is not Krishna, but another who repres ents himself as Krishna or has taken advantage from the beginning of that belief in the mind, or that Krishna is only a god among gods & not the supreme Deity. The doubt of time rests upon immediate disappointment & argues from that to eventual disappointment. The first step is to set right the Tapas. 1. The Tapas, if applied with concentration, determines each series of movements in the sense of satyam brihat with a consider- able but uncertain ritam. 2. This movement is baffled by an inhibition of the Will through partial knowledge which perceives a predominant possi- bility of unsuccess as a fate of unsuccess & help[s] the possibility to realise itself so that it seems justified as the fate. 3 This movement takes advantage of the uncertainty in the ritam, of the fact that knowledge is more correct when not coupled with action of Will on the result & of the weariness which comes on the physical self by expenditure of concentrated tapas. It is necessary 1. That the satyam brihat should prevail also when there is automatic Aishwarya Vashita Ishita without Tapas."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"512 Record of Yoga 2. That the idea of unsuccess should be recognised as a percep- tion of strong or dominant possibility & removed from the central action which seeks the ritam of things in the Apas. 3 That Will & Knowledge should harmonise & coincide & the disparity between Chit of Knowledge & Chit of Tapas be resolved into a unity. For this purpose two principles have to be observed. 1. The combination always of Will & Knowledge 2 The substitution of self acting for concentrated Tapas.

The egoistic faith is already being justified; for it is the reflection of a higher tapas and ritam. The totality of the intelligence is being justified in all the thoughts , for they are being shown to be satyam brihat. The ritam alone is still reserved for imperfection. 2. The intensity of the delight will now be increased in the subjectivity, asserted in the physical ananda. The latter movement has already been recommenced. 3. It is true that the method still belongs to the old method of alternation between Night & Dawn, progression & apparent retrogression. The Nature is too much besieged as yet by the mental Mayavin to admit of the total exclusion of this inchoate & inferior vrijina movement. 4 The satyam has now been sufficiently established in the brihat. The ritam also has to cease to assert itself only in separate detail or small groups and must establish itself in the brihat. This movement also has been prepared, but it must be finally asserted & established. 5. The vijnana of Knowledge & Power is the crux. So long as it is not entirely justified, the perfect finality of Samata & Shakti in the adhar & its environment is not possible. For Error & Defect mean persistence of the vrana in the active Brahman & where there is a wound there will be suffering. The only other escape is into the shantam Brahma in Mind where activity ceases in a silent & impartial Delight that does not fulfil, but only escapes from the necessity of harmony. It is only in the ritam that the Shantam becomes the Active & Nivritti & Pravritti are perfectly reconciled. 6. Ananda is not yet sufficiently asserted in all the activities. The Mayavin of the Manomaya opposes & has hardened his heart against the Light. He has to be expelled, not fostered. 7.

The month of June has closed on this note of imperfect success. The renewal of the struggle between the Siddhi and the powers of limitation has assumed a new aspect; it is no longer, fundamen- tally, a question of the extent of the siddhi, still less of its entire denial. That is now recognised on all hands to be impossible. It is a question of the rapidity, of the continuance or cessation of the method of gradual development and of the habit of relapse & intermission by which the gradation was farther retarded. There may be devious hopes that the fullness of the physical siddhi can be sufficiently retarded to be practically denied or that by this retar- dation & other obstacles the necessary time may be denied to the karmasiddhi or even its fulfilment negatived by untoward events which will render it impossible; but these are failing powers of negation. Only in the last adverse tendency is there yet any serious strength for anything but retardation. Therefore the Force is now being applied to the body. It has been proved that mental power can be applied to the modification of the lines of the figure or of particular parts of the body, to the hair etc; but the working has been slow, intermittent & except in one or two directions only partial in result.

Faith in this siddhi & energy of its fulfilment has to be restored to the body. Finally, in the kriti especially & in dharma a more vigorous action has to be introduced which will dissipate the adverse move- ments & initiate a puissant tide of success. These are the results that have to be initiated in the first fortnight of July. Tapas & samadhi continue to be active; but vijnana is now without illumination in most of its movements.

The Devatas must be more & more convinced of the inutility of their retardatory efforts. Already the affirmations are being strengthened, but there is always an element which comes from the external Nature & seeks to stand between the Master of the Yoga & the Adhara, asserting a different statement of the universal Ego, seeking to replace the personal ahankara by another & more general ahankara.

The suspensions, the at- tempts to force back must be got rid of definitely, but the alternate quickenings & slackenings of speed must continue to operate so long as the physical resistance is not abolished. It is now evident that the Mahakali bhava has come to stay & that it is only the faith in the kriti and certain intensities, eg the tertiary dasya, that are really denied in the second chatusthaya. In the first the physical clouding of the prasada in the prana is the one defect & that proceeds from a defect in the second element of the shakti-chatusthaya. These fluctuations in the second chatusthaya have to be rapidly eliminated. There is faith in the physical siddhi, an elementary faith even in the saundarya, although there are one or two lacunae.

It is not yet clear to the mind how there has been a definite commencement of the removal indicated yesterday. Telepathy of thought is becoming more manifest & the vijnana of knowledge is organising itself, but there does not seem to be any new departure. On the contrary there is a distinct tendency for the Intelligence on a higher level of its secondary stage (sanu) to predominate, illuminated by vijnana, but always referring downwards, for the Mahasaraswati bhava to revive & replace or modify the Mahakali bhava & for the faith in rapidity to be replaced by the faith in a slow & gradual process. The persistence of these tendencies would mean the triumph of the old over the new & of the lower over the higher. At the same time the vijnana proceeds with its organisation in knowledge, the telepathy is ever more comprehensive, telepathy of thought more & more justifies itself in spite of errors of reception, the sense of the triloka in Bhu becomes more & more ordinary & dominant.

The Restrainers seek in the Vijnana to negate entirely the effective Will, to prevent the Telepathy of thought from organising itself, to limit the Trikaldrishti to the passive reception of telepathic satyam. 2. Their aim is also to destroy the subjective Ananda of strug- gle & victory. 3.

In all these points they are, for the present, prevailing. Only the physical Ananda & the telepathic trikaldrishti are visibly & irresistibly advancing. The denial & apparent falsification of the truth of Script is part of their plan of operations. The result is that the seven affirmations seem to be denied & equally the progress towards the ninth.

This has been done by the concentrated method preparing the involved. Vani is sometimes of the gods, sometimes of Krishna. There is external vani of others, but in all cases they are reduced to the terms of truth & Krishnahood. The gods are Krishna in his separate personalities. Darshana Now varies between an advanced second intensity & the third. The Jnanam Brahma, whenever it occurs, is immediately occupied by Krishna. There is an immense extension of the satyam brihat by which all thoughts are seen as true & all forces & impulses as justified, useful & effective. At the same time things are seen not only in the terms of the physical universe, but in those of the nervous, mental & vijnanamaya & by implication in those of the three higher worlds. All things are now sensed as Darshan by the indriyas & all sensations & thoughts as Krishna by the mind & the manasik buddhi. All events also, every thing is seen to be wisely & perfectly guided. It is the apocalypse in the triple world & especially in the triple heaven. Sat, Chit & Ananda are separate in the material minds & because separate, their opposites are possible.

Darshana The third intensity is now established as the normal perception, with the personality. The impersonal form of it & the idea of the mask, which offered themselves as a necessary resting place for the siddhi, have been dispensed with in that character and now take their place among the past approximative perceptions which the exterior mentality after its fashion has a habit of emphasising with a temporary exclusiveness & therefore erecting as an obstacle to farther progress, thus increasing, if not creating, the despotism of Time. The idea of the mask was due to an excessive separation of the form from the reality. Vijnana. Tapas is now showing a marked effectivity, for the resistance is less invariable & less effective, but it persists. The Tapas shows a tendency to extend again to the utthapana and to the kriti.

Necessarily the ritam in tapas & knowledge will not be com- plete today, but it is already persistently powerful & will become still more puissant. Script.

It is becoming independent of smarana, but that is not so apparent. It is more independent than it seems. The contrary notion is due to a false experiential logic in the mind, which lays too much stress on the defect and on a certain attempt of the exterior smarana to rush upon the ananda & claim it as its effect by a rapid self-association. Entire continuity is delayed by old memories in the body which help in keeping up the idea of inability of dharana and the habit of discontinuance. The other physical anandas are more subject to these old mem- ories and habits & too dependent on smarana. The one strong exception is the tivra, but only in certain parts of the body. Telepathy of sensation, feeling, state of mind, vague thought, especially those connected with action, are now extremely strong and frequent. Even when veiled for a time they reassert themselves. Pure thought & precise thought are also received, but here there is a much greater difficulty for the discernment, & they usually come as ideas in the mind rather than as perceptions of another mind.

Darshana The third intensity is fixed in the Krishnadarshan and more prevalent, only in animals it is temporarily of the second intensity, owing to the non-assimilation of the ego. The universality is also nearer to fixity. The intensity of the subjective Ananda has been for a time depressed & denied. It is now again brought forward. This is the Prab[h]ritha of the Veda. Intensity in the Indriya-Anandas, (sight etc) is easy; for it has long been established and can only be covered for a time, but can no longer be limited or, now, divided. The intensity of the purely subjective (manomaya & bauddha) Ananda will from today reach the same immunity. It is already there, but does not occupy always the surface of the chitta. Vijnana is now again active, but the illumination & decisive- ness continue to be resisted. Karma Selected Hymn. Commentary finished. Veda III. 40 . . 52. Aug 19 t . h .

The energy is depressed & the illumination withheld in order to prepare a greater normality of the Vijnana in those tracts of chaitanya that are still insufficiently receptive. Certain habitual activities which belong to the old order of things, are likewise being discouraged by this suspension. The slow trickling in of subscriptions continues; the rapid stream has not yet begun. In Samadhi the organisation is arrested & there is inactivity in rupa and even in lipi, although the latter can always be energised by attention. The action of the Vijnana cannot be destroyed, it can only be suspended for a while with a lowering of its correctness, as soon as it revives, it recovers all its force & power of ritam.

The Kalibhava also persists in strengthening itself and the third intensity of the Darshana. The Dwayavins are being excluded by the perception of the One in all mutually opposing movements & of the harmony of means and end in that movement. The ordinary mental perceptions even in trikaldrishti are be- coming more & more correct. The resistance to the activity of Premananda must be removed. There is no positive denial any longer of the universal Prema which manifests itself in the adverse movements & associates itself with anger, opposition etc turning them to rudrata pure. It is the effigies of the old indifference which has to be replaced by the udasina prema. For there must be three forms of the prema, rudra prema, mitra-prema & udasina prema. All the three must eventually unite into a trinity with one or other of its three faces uppermost at will. This prema must be ugra & chanda; but the saumatya will be always concealed in it as a basis. All this must be done rapidly & even suddenly, not gradually &slowly. But the chief work now must be the perfection of the vijnana; in the trikaldrishti first; for there it is only the remnants of false stress that have to be transformed into right stress. At bottom it is the same in the tapas. The will of the Ishwara has to be known & the adhara made its instrument. Here it is the false stress of partiality that has to be transformed. The rupa & samadhi are less easy to perfect. For there the Nidah have a long record of successful obstruction.

The conversation yesterday has given light on the Yoga. Ananda confirmed & universalised is the path to the conversion of Prana into the universal Chit-Tapas and that the path to the conversion of Body into Sat It is this Chit Tapas which is the base of Aishwarya-Ishita- Vashita; so long as it is not entirely realised there can be only a partial efficacy of the individual Tapas. The way to it is self- association with all energies in the universe. The Dwayavins are those powers who divide these energies into acceptable and inac- ceptable, friendly & hostile, accept some, repel others. A choice is necessary in action, but it must be made not by the Dwayavins, but by the Ishwara. The elimination of the Dwayavins is the main work now in hand. A perfect passivity in the hands of the Ishwara is the first necessity. Subjective Ananda is completed; physical Ananda is being added. Sudden pain of burning has at last become Ananda Pro- longed intensity of pain has also to become Ananda.. The fitness of the body has to be compelled. There is no time for slow and indulgent methods. Faith in the Ishwara & acceptance of all energies & experiences are therefore being given. The remnants of pranic choice between satya & asatya, siddhi & asiddhi, mangala and amangala are giving way. It is this element of pranic choice which is the chief enemy of unity. Faith in some karma has been given; the exact karma is not yet luminously revealed. Or rather the lines are known; the exact accomplishment or the measure of accomplishment in this life is still obscure to the intellect.

Already the sukshma drishti begins again to be active & per- ceive certain elementary forms of the Pranic worlds. There is also the perception of the jnanamaya ego as the Ishwara, spontaneous & without immediate smarana.

The faith must be that it is the Ishwara, Anandamaya & Vijnanamaya who is the guide, although He still uses the im- pulsions & ideas of the Manishi & not yet the full Vijnanamaya harmony. It is the replacement of the mental perceptions & impulses that is the work of the Vijnanachatusthaya. It is because that work is not yet done, that the first two chatusthayas are open to shocks & disturbances through the disappointment of the faith. This is why it has always been said that the absolute finality of the first two chatusthayas depended on the fulfilment of the third. But the entire fulfilment of the third implies the fulfilment of the fourth and fifth and therefore necessarily of the sixth and seventh. Therefore it is an integral fulfilment that is being worked out & this aim prevents the separate perfection of each chatusthaya by itself without relation to the rest.

The first chatusthaya is steadily working out its last remain- ing defect, the recurrence of physical reaction to external sugges- tions of duhkha & aprasada proceeding from others or from the world-environment & taking advantage of the deficient sraddha in the Karma. Persistent Asiddhi in Karma & Yoga is used for this purpose. It stamps nati on the most physical parts of the nervous being as it has already been stamped on the mental being. The second chatusthaya is, except in faith and in realised kar- masamarthya, complete in the manomaya organisation of the self. It has now to be converted into a vijnanamaya organisation based on the faith, the tertiary dasya & the daivi prakriti (karmasamarthya & ishwarabhava). All animal forms are now coming freely in the Chitra. Objects are also more varied. Utthapana, arms, one hour; defect of anima stronger than for some time past.

Note that yesterday, the mind being in doubt about external menaces, the reference ran, “I will lie down & sleep, for thou, O Lord, art only my safety.” The immediate occasion of todays reference was an insistence on immediate organisation of sadharadrishti in jagrat. Forms of rupa, including fourfooted animals, did outline on the background, but without stability or hold upon the akasha. There is a preparation, but except in one or two points, mainly in the first, fifth & sixth, no rapid or final realisation.

It is this which is most difficult to distinguish from the mere perception of force of possibility unsanctioned by the destined Event. Sometimes the trikaldrishti is surprisingly fulfilled at the very moment when non-fulfilment seemed inevitable in the actual occurrence. In such cases it seems to partake of the nature of Ishita, Aishwarya or Vashita.

The Nine Affirmations have now again to be considered It is evident that IV–VII are being completed first. The tertiary dasya is perfect in the body and perfecting in the mind & prana and there is a firm though not always equable or well-distributed sense of the passive yantrabhava in the whole system. But the dasya is not yet the dasya of the Madhura except at times because the subjective Ananda of karma-siddhi asiddhi is not yet perfect in the chitta. Hence the acceptance of all bhoga as a slave & instrument of the Master is near completion, but not the acceptance as a slave and instrument of the Lover. The Personality of Krishna is still often & long concealed behind his workings, his Prakriti. If these can be perfected, the rest will be more easy. For there will be, & this is now preparing to be perfected, the universal sense of the Anandamaya Krishna as the continent & cause of all conscious activity & the base of Ananda with the instrument of free & joyous Tapas & Prakasha. The principle of Affirmation has been constantly growing, but has not yet entirely replaced the principle of rejection & denial. Ritam is developing on the lines of the brihat by the progressive rejection of the idea of the Dwayavins. Affirmations VIII & IX are only preparing. The basis of the five worlds has been laid down in the consciousness, but only the three are habitually active to its awareness & this without particular observation.

There was a partial withdrawal of the Mahakali bhava realised into a form less dominated by MK and more of the nature of Mahasaraswati with the Maheswari-Mahalakshmi type prominent. This seems to be an operation for the increase of the Mahalakshmi colouring in the Chandibhava.

There is the same balance elsewhere. Only telepathy is active here; decisive trikaldrishti is unable to manifest. The telepathy points to the probability of an adverse result. There is strong obstruction to the rapidity of the development of Vijnana and to its constant action. Sharira is also unable to advance. Vijnana It is Vashita, not Aishwarya & Ishita, that brings in the element of resistance, because it is still pursued in the material action by the habit of desire; a desire not formal or accepted, but vague, repre- senting an excess of weight or pressure of pranic tapas rather than what is usually called desire, but easily creative of the psychological phenomena usually associated with or environing desire. The temporary inactivity of vijnana is only in order to give time for the mentality to readjust certain inferior movements & prepare higher & more intense movements. The force of Aiswarya & Ishita really maintains itself, as is shown in the two applications just now made. In one the general movement was executed with a few hesitations, in the other first a general movement, then a precise. The resistance to Vashita is very great & strongly concentrated. It is when the pressure of Vashita is removed from the object, that the movement willed fulfils itself by the Aishwarya, less frequently by Ishita contained in the original Vashita.

The mental being passive & receptive, the Vijnanamaya tapas active, this is the formula for the Dharma and the Kriti. But the tapas is not yet entirely Vijnanamaya.

This importance is real, as it is necessary to develop the Vyaya-lakshmi. But it will develop more rapidly when the samata of the Tapas is effected. At the same time even in the Adhara the Bala-Kishore-bhava is developing and has attained a certain mass in its force of realisation (pajas). Vangmaya thought has suddenly passed from the inspirational- illuminative to the pure inevitable forms of speech. The new form is yet deficient in Asu and Ananda , because the Prakasha it carries with it touches directly the obscurer parts of the mentality which give a less clear response and not the illuminated mind or sentiment which for the present is a little quiescent. This quiescence is necessary in order that the obscurer parts may also become capable of satyam and convinced of satyam. Sometimes, however, the Prakasha, Asu and Ananda are al- lowed to manifest in order to convince the Prana that it is the “true & happy Vak”. sunrita Kamananda still fluctuates owing to the imperfection of the chakra. The Pranic dynamis increases in the body, but is not yet in possession. The Arogya is also in the same uncertain condition. Its force increases and its pressure. But it is not in possession and is unable to expel the recurrent habitualities of Roga. The latter rely on tamasic dhriti of habit for their long persistence, though they are no longer sure of ultimate survival.

The obscuration of vijnana contains a movement of siddhi which is divined and asserted by the tapasic suggestion, questioned and denied by the superficial experience. The acceptance of the internal light in the obscure tapas, even when it contradicts the immediate experience, becomes then a nec- essary development in order that the obscure tapas by justification may assume the habit of light.

December The month of November has been marked principally by a sort of final and irrevocable confirmation of the organised fullness of the two first Chatusthayas. The one defect is in the Faith & Ish- warabhava, the faith not in the Yogasiddhi which is irrevocably confirmed, but in the Karma or rather in the Kriti, as opposed to the Sahitya and Dharma. The faith in the latter is subject to a proviso or doubt in the intellect whether something may not happen through failure of Kriti which will prevent either comple- tion in this life of the full Yogasiddhi, ie the physical & active, or else the complete & successful exteriorisation of the Dharma & Sahitya. The deficient faith in Kriti reacts and prevents the confirmation of the Ishwarabhava and this again produces a certain fluctua- tion, instability and limitation of the Krishna-Kali relation and consciousness which is the basis of successful Kriti. The deficiency of the faith itself is due to experience of deficient effectivity of the Tapas unachieved organisation of the Vijnana. The second result of November has been the confirmation of the Sarvam Anantam Jnanam in the Brahmadarshana with the Ananda constantly, but not continuously manifested. The occa- sional veiling of the Ananda Brahman carries with it a veiling of the Lilamaya Personality in all things & persons; for the two go together The third result has been the confirmation of the satyam brihat in Jnana and with a less firmness and fullness in the trikaldrishti & telepathy and the beginnings of a full and organised ritam.

Shuddhi, Mukti, Bhukti are approaching completion; Siddhi has accomplished its basis in all but Sharira and Tapas of Kriti. In December the line of progress indicates, logically, a con- firmation of the Ananda Brahman, the Lilamaya Personality, the Krishna Kali Bhava, the subjective & physical Ananda, and a development of the satyam ritam brihat in all parts of the Vi- jnanachatusthaya. In Sharira & Kriti, apart from Ananda, no def- inite progress is indicated by the past advance. Some progress is, however, inevitable in Arogya & Utthapana. Saundarya & Kriti are much more doubtful. December 1 s . t . The Ritam continues to grow in an increasing firmness of the satyam, even in trikaldrishti & telepathy. This growth of the satyam ritam is communicating itself to the Tapas.

Vijnana Aishwarya Vashita acted successfully on seven movements of birds & insects in a minute or two with only slight resistance. The Aishwarya from above was effective; it is accompanied by a movement of effort contradicting the Ishwarabhava, but this tends to fall away. In other instances afterwards (children, fourfooted ani- mals) the effect was incomplete, compelling only a partial move- ment in the sense suggested, or came only after a long denial. But in all cases there was either whole or half or three quarters success. In other cases the resistance showed itself only in partial divagations. Only in one case was the final movement contrary, & there the Will was not persisted in. In another the object came back after a short absence & executed the required movement. The Power is not yet perfect, but it shows a great advance on its past effectuality. It is at the degree 50º–60º & is now almost habitual. But it does not yet apply with equal force to Sharira & Kriti. There it only produces effect in details, in movements, & after long pressure in broad & final results.

The beginning was felt in T 3 [telepathy-trikaldrishti-tapas siddhi]; but not in rupa-samadhi, as there was only progress in details in samadhi & a tendency in rupa. Utthapana & Ananda began fresh developments. Arogyashakti was strong enough to negate the attempt at a fresh general attack on the body, to bear exposure at night to cold air from both windows without reaction of fever, cold etc, to expel partially symptoms of one remnant-disease and to compel some progress in assimilation which has yet to be confirmed. For today is predicted 1. Continuation of the same rapidity in vijnana, in subjective base of Karma (Krishna-Kali) & in Brahmadarshana. 2. Beginnings of a greater rapidity in Sharira."},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"29–30 September 31 December 1914 735 The advance in utthapana seems to indicate that the second prediction will be fulfilled.

Krishna Kali The Krishna Kali consciousness is beginning to realise itself. It is indeed realised in the Saguna Brahman, but not in the Ishwara (Lilamaya). The fusion of Indra into the Agni -Vayu -Aryaman (con- taining already Mitra -Varuna -Surya -Bhaga -Aswins -Brihaspati - Twashtri -Maruts -Ribhus) seems to have been effected.

The Ananda since meal-time has only been partially discontinued by force of interruption in sleep. Even if interrupted by sleep or other cause, it should re- sume automatically on waking and not have to be brought back by will or by lapse of time. It is to this siddhi that it is moving. But the continuity is still too dependent on Asana. Krishnabhava & Darshana Krishnabhava is often obscure in the mentality, although fixed.

Rupa in last nights samadhi did sometimes hold the akasha and complete its movement perfectly. Swapnasamadhi is now near- ing the point when it can be perfectly organised. Jagrat is still subject to the general obstacle.

Much of the anritam comes by the attempt of mind to make a formation from the elements of the satyam that it receives instead of allowing the truth of ritam to manifest itself. That which forms is not mind, but vijnana.

As soon as there is smarana, there is complete darshana, but emerging out of the incomplete darshana in which Ananda is involved, not dominant & Krishna concealed by the extended Brahman. In the person Kali is organised in the Maheshwari-Mahaluxmi- Mahasaraswati combination, the second element as yet insufficient, but the dominant Mahakali is occasional only, the normal bhava being the contained and dominated Mahakali. This again is due to the gulf that still remains between the Purusha & the Shakti. The Purusha is the dominant Krishna, bala, Balarama-Aniruddha; but the Prakriti does not always feel the full- ness of the tertiary dasya & the actual presence of the bhava of madhura-dasya. Hence the Ishwara is recognised, but the Devi is not yet Ishwari by expressing the dominant will of the Ish- wara. Hence karma is not yet manageable.

The imperfect figure is only an indication of the Drishti working upon the physical akasha to open it to the physical vision. . The Drishti will do its own work unaided by trataka.

The completeness of the satyam of telepathy & telepathic trikaldrishti is becoming more & more absolute. The ritam lingers because of continued misapplication in time, circumstance, eventuality.

The other shariranandas manifest from time to time. The madhura dasya is attaining continuity, but the mere dasya is still too dominant over the madhura. This is a defect that from tonight will begin to disappear. The one real obstacle is insufficient sraddha in rapidity & in kriti. Sahityasiddhi is now assured in all its parts. The physical op- position, it will be found, is disintegrated. Only the remnants of it remain. Ritam of trikaldrishti is more & more emerging; only it is not yet applied to important things in a large & definitive fashion. Telepathy of thought & feeling is recovering distinctness, but is not yet sufficiently confident of its ritam. The Mahakali-Mahasaraswati consciousness with the Maha- luxmi colour is finally taking form, but has not yet sufficient force of Mahakali. For today in the Script, a progress in jagrad rupa antardrishta, in tapas-siddhi and in lipi was specially indicated. These indications often denote a movement of tendency rather than of definite or immediate fulfilment. Lipi is visibly arranging the page behind the veil and shadows out from time to time, in front of it the reflection of its concealed movement. This it did yesterday, the large page appearing, but unvivid and therefore illegible. In front, entire vividness & stability of the long single line was reasserted, less vividness & stability of the double line, still less of the triple. The lipi still keeps the tendency to dissolve when it has been read. This is the chief obstacle to progress. Only sthapatya lipi has conquered it. Chitra sometimes prevails. Akasha tries to prevail. In antardrishta there is the same movement of lipi less pro- nounced in its partial success."},{"pageNumber":819,"pageContent":"1 January–27 February 1915 805 Tapas-siddhi seems to be preparing its movement rather than to be actually advancing. The dasya of Mahakali-Mahasaraswati with the Mahalakshmi tinge is now affirmed. Whenever the Mahakali consciousness has been affirmed in Mahasaraswati, it has had too strong a tendency to overwhelm both Mahasaraswati and Maheshwari & assert the violent Asuric Kali bhava. For this reason the combination Mahasaraswati- Maheshwari has been constantly strengthened against this assertion & each time it has thus been strengthened, it has absorbed more & more of the Kalibhava which it denied. Tonight the combination Mahalaxmi-Mahakali was effected & held steady against the Asuric Kali tendency which it then took into itself. By this action the perfect harmony was estab- lished; for Mahalaxmi has always asserted itself in the Maheshwari- Mahasaraswati formula, that is to say, with the right continent and the right pratistha. All that has now to be effected is the strengthen- ing of the Kali tejas & virya till it reaches the right intensity without disturbing the other elements of the harmony. The intensification is already proceeding. The result is the divinised Asuro-Rakshasi Kali with the Pisachi, Pramatheswari & Pashavi contained in the Rakshasi element. Mahalaxmi-Mahasaraswati brings with it the Gandharvi element. The smooth development is now possible because the dasya is now complete and is taking the madhura into itself. The bhava is firmly founded on jnana & state of being & the Ishwara is being felt in all thought, feeling & action. The distinction between Ishwara and Prakriti is not yet merged in the unity + difference, but the Prakriti is subordinate & more conscious of being a form of the Ishwara. Mahalaxmi brings with her bhakti & prema, the stable per- manence of which was so long denied."},{"pageNumber":820,"pageContent":"806 Record of Yoga Jan 11 t . h . The growth of ritam in the trikaldrishti continues, but still works chiefly on the material of the telepathy. There is also a movement towards ritam of the impulsions which is not yet complete, but their satyam is now pronounced. Sraddha in the guidance is now becoming absolute, but is still only partly illumined by knowledge of the exact drift of the guid- ance. Nevertheless, the exact sense & utility of each movement, whether overtly favourable or apparently adverse is more & more understood. The sraddha is limited also by the doubt of the rapidity & of the kriti. In the vijnana & subjectivity generally the doubt of rapidity is giving way to comprehension of an increasing swiftness & sureness in the development; but in sharira & kriti the view is still blind. It is certain that something will be done, but the way & the extent is withheld from the knowledge. It only appears as a speculative formation. Samata is almost entirely free from reactions of positive de- pression. There is only a shadow of depression & impatience due to defect of tapas-siddhi. Sraddha in exact tapas-siddhi once accomplished there will be no farther defect of the first two chatusthayas. The completion of the third is therefore the practical assurance of the whole Yoga-siddhi. The rest is only a matter of Time. Jan 12 t . h .

The sama Ananda increases constantly & the only shadow over it is that of the recurrent unfaith. On the other hand Shakti is affected by non-fulfilment and Asraddha. Tapatya continues, but fitfully where there is not the faith and without assured Ananda. The Siddhi seems to move towards the Ananda of a purely disinterested and instrumental Tapatya not depending on faith in the results. But this brings a certain indifference to the Tapas-siddhi which cannot be final. Jagrat rupa is at last manifesting really stable forms of all kinds that are at the same time clear, vivid & complete. 4 footed animal forms, long withheld by return of asiddhi, today manifest freely, but at first had no stability. They have already however begun to assume stability, though the movement is not yet successfully accomplished. All this is in crude & with trataka, just in front of the eyes in a thick pranic akasha. The figures at first ran swiftly away to the right, but they can now be kept floating before the eyes. Both these results, reappearance & initial stability of four- footed animal forms and the cessation of the fugitive movement, are instances of almost instantaneous effectivity of tapas. Lipi continues to develop fixity of single line and legibility of the multiple line.

The resistance of living things in station is now overcome. Success is more usual than failure and exact fulfilment is frequent and striking. There are also now cases of immediate triumph over fixed intention in rapid movement. It remains to give full intensity & universality to the power of the Tapas, raising it all round to the 80º, so that the resistance may disappear and Time, Place & Circumstance become instrumental instead of determinative. It is to this result that the siddhi now turns. Effective tapas has to be imposed on the body & on the life (karma). Siddhi is effected in the first two chatusthayas & in the sixth & in three parts of the general (seventh) chatusthaya, & in the subjective half of the fifth, so far as is possible without dominance of the Tapas-Prakasha in the fourth & effective half of the fifth.

The violent attack of the old Asiddhi has failed after produc- ing a few fugitive vibrations, an effigies of incipient asamata & non-vijnana. The struggle between Kamananda and its obstruction is now becoming constant. Decisive trikaldrishti, independent of telepathy, increases in force, frequency & certainty; but it works in the midst of a mass of telepathies acting in the manas which tend indeed more & more to reveal their satyam of tendency or actual possibility, but continue to throw a shadow of confusion on the trikaldrishti. The Knowledge is still farther confused by the anrita will-thought, which is a stressed perception of tendency or actual possibility in the physical or sub- conscious that does not manifest in event, although it sometimes manifests in conscious tendency. Knowledge & Tapas are this morning acting again in the manas & not in the vijnana; therefore there is no general ritam; only a ritam disengaging itself with difficulty from the brihat of the unregulated mental satyam. This constitutes a relapse. The vibrations of asamata of asiddhi continue & amount to a breaking in on the siddhi of the fourth chatusthaya.

There was, however, a movement to remanifest the lost stability of rupa & continuity of active drishya, but the continuity achieved was only of the manasic drishta and the stability had no sufficient hold on the akasha. The siddhi is now restored with a more direct presence of the Ishwara in the thought and script and a more intimate prabhutwa in the dasya by the diminution of the role and insistence of the instrumental ganas.

Anandamaya Samata The first chatusthaya is delivered from the external attacks of the nirananda and asamata. Only a slight vibration is left combating the Ananda of failure, but this is itself becoming Anandamaya of the duality and is kept only to found a particular vibration of the pure Ananda. 2. Daivi Prakriti The daivi prakriti and the fundamental sraddha are founded firmly and the Mahakali energy has occupied the Mahasaraswati frame, covered the Maheshwari pratistha, assumed the Mahaluxmi colouring and made its fiercer working compatible with the anan- damaya samata . This movement is not yet touched to the final perfection and the ishwarabhava and sraddha are still insufficient and fluctuate on the surface. But the former defect is likely to disappear during the month. The latter depends on the imperfec- tion of the vijnana and will disappear as the Tapas increases in its effectiveness. 3. Brahman & Krishna Kali The Anandam Brahma is now fixed in the vision of all things and only occasionally goes back for a moment into the Anantam Jnanam Brahma. Along with this finality there is also the finality of the Lilamaya darshana in all existences; there is no longer the sharp distinction which confined the strong darshana to that which is urjasvi , the beautiful, young, noble or emphatic in character or to the human being. The siddhi however needs a more unwa- vering firmness and a more delightful intensity. These come to it sometimes, but are not yet part of the normal vision. Krishnakali has been fixed in the consciousness finally. The Ishwara governs the action, thought etc entirely, but not yet with an invariable prominence. He is vibhu , but not always immediately & directly prabhu.

Organised vijnana Vijnana is organised in all its parts. Tapas, telepathy, trikal- drishti work together, but while telepathy is brihat and almost entirely and spontaneously ritam , trikaldrishti though always ac- tive, has often to wait for or acquire its ritam out of the mass of the possibilities. The ritam however plays a large part and grows continually. Tapas is effective sometimes as will-thought against resistance, sometimes as Chit-Tapas. It is not yet entirely chit-tapas and therefore not in possession of the samrajya. Samadhi is still crude & unstable in the jagrat, and in the swapna still brief and often attacked by confusion and dislocation, but all the necessary elements are present and work more and more together. The perfection of the first three siddhis may be expected in July as well as a much greater perfection of the fourth. Deficiencies Sharira is the field of the main conflict; the Arogya is subject to constant attack which takes the form of habitual fragmentary roga. Utthapana after making a great stride (primary) fell back & is suspended. Saundarya has been unable to manifest in the head and jara attacks chiefly in the hair. In the bhava there is eternal youth. Karma makes little visible headway. It waits on the growth of the effective Tapas. It is attacked chiefly in equipment and freedom.

The Maheshwari Pratistha is submerged, but the Mahalaxmi-Mahasaraswati continent is still too strong for the right intensity of the Mahakali inhabitant to fix itself. In Samata there is still a tendency to return of depression by non-faith in Siddhi.

In the latter case Ma- heshwari pratistha tends to be hidden, as is intended, in Mahakali intensity of the prana, but the intensity ceases in the general Tapas. In the latter there is intensity of tapas, but the pratistha appears & emphasises itself so as to support the tapas & prevent a relapse into the rajasic Kali. In the former there is a harmony and the intended harmony, but with insufficient sense of power. This has now to be remedied.

At present, however, the will-thought is much more normally effective than it ever was before; but it is not yet entirely effective and seldom immediately effective.

There is also the lapse into the intel- lectual perception visited by vijnana from the general vijnanamaya perception suffered by the intellectual & sensational mind. These defects have to be remedied. In the Krishnadarshana, the difficulty of the entire perception of all forms as entirely Krishna is still only occasional & the siddhi which has progressed rapidly oscillates back into the lower stages from and through which it has progressed. The Shakti is aiming at the final removal of these defects. The movement of the Samadhi is again suspended. Sharira still continues in the same state of obstruction. Ananda (kama) in sharira tries to move again towards normal continuity, the others towards normal recurrence. Aug 7 The Krishnadarshana has surmounted several of its difficulties. Formerly the adult vulgar & hirsute masculine face did not at once throw back the idea of Krishna. Now all faces at once reflect him. There was also a division between the Krishna in human form & the formless & universal Krishna. Either the first was intensely sensed & the latter became merely Brahman or the latter was seen & the human form became a mask of Brahman + guna etc. This is now in type surmounted; but the Siddhi goes back to this stage firmly in order to bridge over the division by proceeding from the universal to the individual and no longer from the individual to the universal.

Therefore for things in motu the perfect movement is delay[ed], others contrary or imperfect intervening, or there is a failure of the occasion. In the latter case either the failure is definitive or the object returns to the same place & executes the movement or some other comes & executes it in its place. For things in motu, the movement is often executed, but in another place & time than was first indicated, after one or more contrary or imperfect movements; sometimes it is done immediately, sometimes in the same place but after delay or return. Nevertheless the end of resistance is within sight for things near in time & place Vani has assumed the entire madhura dasya relation which is beginning to affirm itself definitively; with it comes the full sense of the Lila and the attahasya. The intermediate vani now makes no difference. This siddhi is extending itself to the script & vangmaya. At the same time the perceptive thought is becoming more powerful in trikaldrishti. Tivra Ananda is becoming much more intense and tends to unite itself with madhura. Raudra is becoming frequently spontaneous (without sma- rana).

The exact time was fixed about half an hour before fulfilment, the approximate time about an hour before. The tapas-siddhi has been steadily increasing in general force. The rule of resistance is no longer so absolute. Very often the ex- act movement is fulfilled again and again without resistance or with a minimum of resistance; but where the object is station- ary at first, there is usually resistance. Eg. a squirrel on opposite ledge, suggested to mount on parapet, afterwards perceived that it was not to be at that spot (A), but might be farther on (B); seen that it would go on to the turn of the ledge; went on beyond to the end whence it attempted to descend. Stopped by will which suggested and trikaldrishti affirmed that it should mount the para- pet suddenly; was compelled to do so by arrival of crow. This movement was twice willed, foreseen and fulfilled. Afterwards it went near position A, on the ledge, then frightened by a crow on the other side, fled to B exact and mounted in accordance with the original suggestion. This example and many others show that trikaldrishti and tapas, so long enemies, are beginning to unite and coalesce. Ss [Saurins] return seen at either 9.15 or 9.30.

It always produces some effect slight or great, immediate or subsequent, in the object willed or other object not willed, perceptible in act or only just perceptible in tendency: but accurate result is now becoming frequent, though not yet continu- ously active.

This darshana formerly de- pended on strong perception of the Ananda Brahman coupled with strong perception of the Lilamaya. It is now automatic, even when Ananda Brahman is depressed and sense of Lila not prominent.

Formerly the drishya there was evanescent, disappearing as soon as manifest, or else permanent only so long as the waking mind in sleep did not turn its eye upon the thing seen and it was only watched by the dream mind above.

All siddhi, except in the first chatusthaya, is subject to tempo- rary denial in its later acquisitions. Instances of immediate or exact fulfilment of tapas begin to become more normal; eg, a kite near the window pursued by crow; knowledge-will that crow should strike three times rapidly, then fly away; immediately & exactly fulfilled.

There is the old struggle between the intellectuality to keep the truth for itself & become intuitive mind of the intelligence and the ideality to replace the intellectuality and establish the pure intuitive mind or the vijnana itself. For the present the intellectuality prevails; but tends to lose its hold of both satyam and ritam in the struggle. Wednesday. March [8] 3 The Krishnadarshana is again subject to fluctuations. It has descended into the Anantam & the Jnanam; but the Chidghana is now more normally informed & encompassed by the Ananda and perceives the Narottama in the Nara. Sometimes however it is more Anantam than Jnanam and then sees merely the Nara with only an implicit Ananda and the Chidghana prayas. All is now being turned into Ananda in the mind & body. The old reactions returned for a long time in the morning, but were forced to be anandamaya, as are all discomfortable sensations in the body. Nor can they now disturb the calm of the being, but only suspend the hasyam with a minor contradiction of the sukham making itself an ananda of asukham & ashivam. Monday. Mar.

After several days cessation the trikaldrishti is being again worked over, for a more positive satyam. The first movement is a greater certainty of the final result, but this is still by suggestion to the intellect or in the intellect. The difficulty is still to distinguish always, though it can now generally be done, the ideal suggestion from the intellectual certainty which cannot be securely trusted. There is also an attempt to fix ritam of detail; this is still done in the old way, by unillumined suggestion to the intellect. Eg re the bath; fixed as after 11.30. Times fixed 11.35, 11.30 for unknown stages, 11.38 for being called to bathe: then 11.30 was fixed for S [Saurin] getting up from under the tap, 11.35 for Ms [Monis] finishing the actual bathing. 11.38 & 11.30 came out exactly to the second, but there was some doubt about 11.35 as the exact time was not noticed. At 11.35 3 – 4 M had left the tap and was drying himself. Usually tapas is eventually successful in the immediate envi- ronment but the tapas is no longer personally used; it comes of itself. Since yesterday script and vangmaya are constantly in the type of vijnana with prakasha , asu and ananda , and Vani, less securely, in the type of pure ananda containing vijnana. Reference carries with it a great clearness, appositeness and sure fulfilment. Sometimes there is wrong application or combination of time and circumstance. Eg. 7.8 was given and taken as the time when Bh. [Bharati] would come; but at 7.8., the servant went out, Bh. came at 7.27.

Ideal certainty is temporarily suspended The instruments, except perceptive thought, are free now from the remnants of intellectuality. There are three planes of ideality. The third or lowest re- gards the intellect, corrects and fulfils it. The first is absolutely independent. The second is intermediate.

The illu- mination of Tapas is, however, progressing, though with a more hampered movement. Tapas is now being used for primary utthapana & the nature & laws of primary utthapana are being developed in the thought and initially brought in the body, though constantly borne down by the normal physical nature. The nature of it is liberation from exhaustion, weariness, strain and all their results. The laws are (1) Standing, however long, shall be effectively as much a rest from motion as [sitting] 10 or lying down. (2) Lying down as a rest shall cease to be indispensable. (3) The greater and more prolonged the motion, the greater the increase of force for continued motion. It is evident that if the last is accomplished, the first will be unnecessary and the second will be fulfilled. At present stiffness as an after result is reduced to a minimum, but muscular pain and sense of strain after persistent exercise of muscles in walking (especially in shoulders & neck) persist. Im- mediate exhaustion can be very rapidly cast out, but accumulative effect is still painful. The general pranic force increases by sadhana, but the body is affected and through the body the most physical part of the pranakosha.

The tapas is moving towards its self-harmonising with the supreme Will in the matter of Time both as to final result and detail of stages in the evolution of the result. Accumulative fatigue is being massed and emphasised in order to be exhausted more rapidly and attacked more completely by the Tapas. The exhaustion felt was very great, so much that the body insisted on the need of recumbence to ease the back, but a few min- utes afterwards after half an hours sitting all had gone, activity returned, wine of anandamaya tapas was felt in the body and the tables were rearranged, dusted and motion kept up for an hour and a quarter with return of pain in the shoulder and neck and with unease in the physical nerve matter, but without the sense of dominating fatigue, rather of dominating vigour. Nor is there now any inclination in the Prana to rest. All thought (not trikaldrishti), even what was formerly the discursory vagabondage of the mind, is becoming luminous, ideal and true in its limits. Raudra Ananda is developing. Sharp & long-running muscular pain three times repeated, which would formerly have been felt as torture, was entirely anandamaya; the sharp pain in the neck- muscles is also being transformed.

Afterwards it attempted to develop in the legs and partly succeeded; when tapas is withdrawn, fatigue declares itself. Rupasiddhi is successfully developing variety in the crude. Formerly only a few types came with difficulty or easily only by repetition the woman, the horse, the man on horseback or driving, sometimes groups of men [and] women, two horses and riders the bird (crow or sparrow), butterfly or moth, one or two objects, a hill with figures or a building on it. Now many kinds of fourfooted animals, birds, insects, moths of various forms and hues. Others seem to be coming, fish, variety of objects, not yet variety of scenes & human figures. After swapna samadhi this has increased; already, all sorts of fourfooted beasts the thing most resisted till now while variety of figures (boys, a mans face and head with hat) has begun, variety of scenes is trying to manifest; old forms which were vague (horse with carriage) are now becoming clear and complete. These shapes have usually little stability, swift variation, a trend to momentary precision. Sometimes they are precise and have an initial stability, sometimes more stability with precision and perfect completeness, but this is rare. Now however an attempt to combine precision, completeness and stability with the variety has begun. Samadhi Antardarshi.

Pages for reading are being presented with more firmness, not yetwithmuchsuccess. In jagrat bahirdarshi variety of scenes is beginning eg a house above a ghat, the ghat very clear, the house sufficiently & coloured; a bridge over a stream, a boy upon it not sufficiently clear and vivid; a temple and ghat and road the same & high bank of a river. Other scenes longer and more detailed, but vague. Variety of human figures increased, women, children, young men, boys (youth & beauty predominate) in various postures, groups, scenes, action. Variety of birds and insects and fish is de- veloping. A great variety of buildings of all forms and structures, chiefly in colour, when not in prakasha. Thus the poverty of the crude rupa seems to be at an end. Raudra ananda is increasing greatly in frequency, intensity and even in prolonged intensity. Vaidyuta also tends to develop. Vishaya is strong and general, but in intensity tends to pass into the others. Prolonged intensity of pain (internal, ahaituka and sahaituka) no longer overpowers the ananda; it increases it, merges into it or turns into it. Also pain is now seldom separate from the ananda; it does not come and cause it whether at the moment of the touch or after the touch has seized it, but is amalgamated with it. It is either anandamaya pain or pain-ananda or pure raudra ananda. Even in strong pain from outside touches, eg burning, this tends to be the rule. The old separation is only an occasional survival. Discomfort is following the same rule, but has not gone so far towards absorption. Strong attack on the siddhi.

The attack on growing arogya also continues. Sensitiveness to cold and discomfort returned. Ideality is taking hold of the interpretation of lipi; only the intellectual atmosphere still surrounds it. This, according to the lipi, is to be removed by tonight. Ideality is also taking firm hold of telepathy in connection with trikaldrishti. All telepathy of the kind is now correctly understood in substance; the sole disturbing factor is the remnants of the mental tendency to fix event by the mind choosing one of the possibilities or tendencies or intentions thus seen as the event. Often this is done correctly, the possibility being properly valued, but then the method breaks down. If this can be removed, there will be no farther positive obstacle to correct certainty in the trikaldrishti; though some negative obstacles will remain. All this is in the field of exercise, not yet applied to life and the world at large. Tapasic mind action, = will stress in the knowledge or effective mind action is being idealised and taught the truth within it and its limits as well as its possibilities.

It would be easy to develop a great variety of vague, im- perfect, instable figures, but both in inner and outer jagrat vision this is being rejected and combined precision, stability and variety is being insistently demanded. Rupas of yesterday, of all kinds, but a few or one or two of each, in spite of the obsession of the akasha by the type rupa, which again appeared strongly in all forms, except the perfect or lifelike. The higher forms appear freely only after long watching of the living object. Stability + precision is not yet satisfactory (outside type rupa) except in one or two forms. Source of ideal certainty has appeared, tapas-light, and is beginning to group round it[s] certainty telepathies of the stages and their tendencies. The movement is as yet kachcha. It was interrupted by a violent, rather brief attack of mental tapas which left the telepathy much freer than before from false in- cidence. Brief physical touches of asamata, strong but without body. The attempt is now to abandon all tapas except the ideal will-knowledge. Physical asiddhi continues, but the siddhi also, though over- weighted, persists.

Temporary suspension of ideality, for a certain development of first two chatusthayas amounting to forceful samata and combina- tion of ugrata and dasya. Caused by a circumstance throwing life siddhi into doubt. This endured till nearly noon when the ideality began again to play. It has firmly acquired certain elements of cer- tainty of event, but for the most part it is composed of certainties of ideal telepathy. Thought telepathy is beginning to take shape and justify itself in a less scattered fashion, more habitually and organically. The habit of evolving rupas out of a confused blur of material, one changing into another before it was well formed, most not de- veloping properly, many only hinting themselves, others confused together, is being again discouraged. Only figures which present precision first, then precision + stability are accepted. Variety is at the same time being demanded. As the result of yesterdays crude progress, the delineation of entirely perfect stable crude figures is gaining strength, frequency and variety. Antardarshi is at last taking into itself the bahirdarshi gains; but stability & precision are not yet properly combined, neither being quite perfect in itself. Variety is great and scenes and colours are more vividly depicted. It is noticeable that the physical light still makes a difference; when the room is open, the atmosphere of the antardarshi is lu- minous and the forms & scenes tejomaya and vivid; when two of the windows are closed, it is chhayamaya and the scenes and forms vague and chhayamaya though vaster, more full of unseen details.

All is done by the supreme Shakti from above. At first the ideal thought failed and broke off in sushupti owing to nidra, but the Shakti insisting, the thought resumed, without coming back to swapna , in the sushupti itself. Still in the deepest depth of all, there is still a little difficulty in eliminating nidra. (2) Recently, the samadhi has developed the power of being in sushupti and yet receiving clear sense knowledge of the waking world limited to one or two sounds etc without for that ceasing to be sushupta. Today this developed into a triple Samadhi, the Ishwari sushupta, full there of ideal thought and absorbed con- sciousness, yet aware of another swapna consciousness open to a second plane of action and another conscious without living in it of things in the outer world (3) Consciousness of the supramental Ishwari, the Shakti of which the mental Jiva is a mental personality The Akasha still resists the rupadrishti. It can no longer persist long in denying forms to the eye; but it still perseveres ordinarily in the blur method and is more ready to give precision than stability. It yields free variety of forms only when quick succession is allowed and complete precision is not demanded, and even then with a cer- tain reluctance, a preference of forms that have been often repeated, a tendency to deny those, eg quadrupeds, which it has been in the habit of denying. Formerly, the principle was to form by mental-physical pres- sure images out of akashic material, the material being of seven kinds, chhaya, dhuma, tejas, jyoti, varna, agni, prakasha. The result was a blur of material shaping itself into forms. A second method was sudden manifestation of form partial or complete out of other akashas into the physical. The second is now preferred. Mental and physical pressure are abandoned except when they recur involuntarily as a habit. Ideal will only is used. Depression of the physical in the evening in the mental shama.

Recoil of the siddhi, owing to perception of anrita in what professed to be the ritam ; this comes by excessive and therefore wrong affirmation.

But the difficulty must not be underrated, nor achievement too easily announced. There is greater spontaneity with a certain amount of variety, precision, stability in the rupa. But the stability is less than the pre- cision, the variety comes still with difficulty. The terrestrial akasha is overborne, but not yet conquered and possessed. Antardarshi still lingers amid difficulties. Scenes and objects come, but without clarity of precision or clear stability or ease of variety. In Samadhi yesterdays experience reaffirmed, but with a less powerful grasp on the sushupti. On the other hand, the triple Samadhi has developed. Not only are sushupti, swapna and jagrat simultaneous, but the sushupta purusha or shakti not only observes, but judges the jagrat experiences and, initially at least, the swapna perceptions.

Lipi continues with a tendency to fix itself, but is yet resisted by the physical akasha. The lipi is rapidly organising itself. First it has come sparingly making itself precise. Here there are two movements. In one sug- gestion, no longer intellectual, but ideal, helps the lipi to manifest, but it is then legible, yet not vivid, with a relative stability and only becomes vivid and stable by repetition; but it comes swiftly and writes itself out fluently. In the other movement it comes of itself, without assistance of suggestion, but slowly, sparingly; it is then usually very vivid, legible, spontaneous, stable not with a long stability, but sufficient to be clearly read and held. Subsequently there has come, with the assistance of sugges- tion, with all the characteristics of the first movement, [? ] but are imperfectly realised to vividness. Now it is emphasising this tendency and preparing to reject entirely the help of the suggestion. By suggestion is meant now the ideal minds perception of what the lipi is going to write or intends in its sense, but has not yet written. K.A. Kamananda is not so vivid as yesterday, but has a greater natural persistence in trying to manifest itself uninterruptedly. In this it does not yet succeed. Arogya The battle of the arogya still continues; the force of health in- creases and the tapas for health, but the undominated roga tenden- cies still hold the body against it. The one dominated attacks some- times with energy, but its physical results are scattered and feeble. The main struggle now is over the digestion and assimilation where there has been a setback.

Then a physical attack unprece- dentedly rapid in its repetitions of intense pain. Ananda (raudra) maintained itself with difficulty, sometimes overborne but always repossessing the pain.

It lives sometimes in the mental, sometimes in the vijnana plane; in the first shuddha predominates with vijnana subordinate to ahaituka; in the latter sometimes shuddha some- times vijnana predominates.

Subjective shuddhi is only defective in as much as the intellectual mentality still resists complete elimination by trans- formation into the ideality; but the separation & distinction of the two in knowledge is now complete. The full transformation is rather siddhi than shuddhi. Therefore only siddhi remains of the four elements of the seventh chatusthaya.

No advance in samadhi The play of the old telepathies and tapas-telepathies continues with a view to their loss of all decisive force and reduction to their proper proportions. Meanwhile the action of higher ideality in T 2 is suspended. It is in force only in the jnana. The direction is now for the ideality to act wherever it is free, jnana-perception, vangmaya, lipi, reference etc and not to wait suspended for the T 2 . This it is already beginning to do The alternations between the higher and the lower devibhava continue. The higher has at present too much of the Maheshwara in it, being dominated by Surya. There is an increasing attempt at control of the speech by the ideality. The power of the ideality is definitely emerging out of the state of subjection to the circle of the physical mentality. For some time it has acted in this field and upon it from above, dealing with the facts and the ideas open to the lower mind, the knowledge beyond its ken being presented to it as suggestions, not as light possessed by the mind. A higher action is now beginning to outline itself, not, as before, as something beyond the normal, but as the normal action of the new vijnana-buddhi. Mar 9.

The lower knows the higher as the thing behind to which it refers back for the source of its activities; the higher looks down to the lower as its own fulfilment. Suddha vijnanananda is becoming more and more confirmed, brilliant and intense on the vijnana plane. It is becoming also full of the devibhava and is preparing to base the full Krishna Kali darshana. Devibhava grows in firmness and intensity and is preparing to expel the habit of reversion by the full illumination of the lower bhava and the removal of the division between para and apara. Kamananda severely tried for the last few days has persisted in spite of depression and may now be considered as firmly established against all dependence on condition and attempt at temporary ex- pulsion. It is still however capable of temporary depression, never now amounting to entire suppression, and subject to rise and fall of intensity, to lesser or greater power of recurrence and continuity. It also varies with the asana, tending to be quiescent in the others except by smarana or uddipana. These are the defects that have yet to be conquered. The other anandas seem to be awaiting the complete victory of the kamananda. Only the sahaituka tivra advances steadily, though without any marked rapidities and subject to temporary quiescences. It is still not free from the fault of the cessation of the nervous response after constant stimulation. For a time the re- sponse maintains itself, may even become more intense, afterwards it becomes neutral or changes to vishaya, raudra or vaidyuta. The energy of the Shakti is more and more changing from saumya to raudra. The Mahakali bhava has therefore taken full possession of the centre of energy, though it still fluctuates and has not taken its final character."},{"pageNumber":994,"pageContent":"980 Record of Yoga Mar 10. At present the attack of the old against the new is the general feature of the sadhana. An attack in the first place on the siddhi of the third chatusthaya, obstruction and inefficiency, with the view of breaking down the recent gains of the first and second, and thus bring the system back to the poise of the old intellectual mentality of the limited human poise. While there is no definite breaking down, there is a certain success in restoring old touches of the asamata that had been expelled touches of the asukham (predicted by lipi, “grief”.) The traigunya-siddhi is especially denied. Shama alone seems perfect; tapas and prakasha fall back into mental rajas & sattwa when there is an attempt to particularise their actions. Devibhava also now tends to sink to the lower condition by separation from the higher and, when joined to it, the poise is still in the lower rather than in the higher nature. There is a denial of ishwarabhava and sraddha in which the knowledge of the buddhi is resisted and tends to be overcome by the sense of deficiency & nonfulfilment acting on the pranic temperament. Absolute finality, therefore, is still to seek in the first two chatusthayas. Samadhi of the three avasthas; freer play of ideal thought, vangmaya and perceptive, the latter first free, afterwards ob- structed. For some time there have been sudden attacks on the health during samadhi which could not be successful during the waking. This is because a certain physical depression or even disintegration seems to take place in samadhi which is not possible when the tapas is concentrated on the physical world as the mental. Although this has been greatly reduced, it is still sufficient to leave the room open for attacks, eg yesterday of violent nausea, a thing easily dominated and dismissed if it comes in the waking state, today, of pain near the muladhara which refused to be turned into ananda although"},{"pageNumber":995,"pageContent":"15 February–31 March 1917 981 it could [not] prevent some ananda from being associated with it, though much submerged or rather overweighed and oppressed.

Mar. 11. The main necessity is the full illumination of the tapas which remains on the lower level and for this the return to the direct dasya, but dasya to the vijnanamaya anandamaya Ishwara. For some days the sense of the immediate presence of the Ishwara has been withheld and all has been done by the Prakriti. Now the presence is being restored and with it the intensity of dasya, but not the entirely immediate presence. The Prakriti still stands between. Kamananda oppressed yesterday, though always present in sensible tendency, is recovering itself, in action at first, not yet in intensity. The tapas-siddhi is losing its exclusive insistence on the par- ticular result, accepting as its own the opposite energies and their results. Yet at the same time it is increasing its power of general and particular result. The Chitshakti is insisting on a more universally vivid sense of all beings and objects as the anandamaya Ishwara manifesting himself in various forms. This is resisted by the mentality which is accustomed to see Brahman in all and all in Brahman and, with a less facile readiness, Brahman as all, but not all as the Ishwara. Notably, it makes more resistance as to beings than as to objects; in the latter the shuddha-chidghana-ananda is more habitually seen than in beings."},{"pageNumber":996,"pageContent":"982 Record of Yoga The difficulty of the tapassiddhi is still to combine it with trikaldrishti. The aspect[s] of will and idea in the telepathic mind, tapas and jnana, are being now gradually harmonised; but the decisive trikaldrishti and the decisive tapas do not come together. Samadhi is recovering its force, but as yet no new progress has been made. A considerable advance has been made towards the firm nor- malisation of the chidghana ananda in objects. Samadhi continues to progress towards complete recovery of its force, but is not as yet in firm possession of itself. Mar 12. The universalising of the Ishwara-darshana is extended to be- ings as well as objects. When the ananda-darshana falls back into the mentality, it tends to be replaced by the Brahma-darshana; when it remains in the vijnana, it is firm. There is now a tendency to have the Ishwara vision in the mentality even, but only as a circumstance of the Brahma vision. In the vijnana the two become one, Brahma (Akshara and Kshara) being only aspects of the Ishwara. Samadhi is now in possession of itself. It moved forward in three directions (1) The enforcement of the ideal consciousness as basis of vijnana-samadhi. (2) The insistence against lapse of memory. (3) The insistence on coherency everywhere. In addition there was a manifestation of chhayamaya tejas & varna, scenes shadowy but full of beauty, subdued brilliance, rich colour and the faery atmosphere of the ananda.

Meanwhile the old round of breaking up and rebuilding the broken siddhi is feebly occupying the atmosphere. Samadhi at night confirms the day action. Kavya for the last two days. Chitra daily, crude but with the automatic movement and growing norm. March 13. Tuesday. The suddha chidghana is now the normal basis of the ananda- darshana for objects, the attempt at reversion to mental shuddha still surviving, but feebly. The same holds good for animal forms, but with more strength in the reversion. It is only in the human figure (chiefly the face) that the reversion is still strong; but here too the sarvasaundarya of shuddha chidghana is gaining rapidly in strength and becoming normal. The strength of reversion here is due to the fact that there is a standard of divine beauty to which the actual form does not correspond. The movement now is to strengthen sraddha so that there may be no room for any lapse, even slight, in the first two chatusthayas. In the first there is still a deficiency in ananda of asiddhi and in the shuddha chidghana ananda of the vishayas, taste, sound etc especially taste. Rasagrahana is there, but not invariable bhoga owing to the pranic resistance and therefore not the full, vivid and satisfying ananda. Kamananda is recovering intensity. There is strong obstructive resistance to the physical siddhi, also to the karma-siddhi. The chief obstacle to the ananda of asiddhi is that when it comes entirely, it tends to bring acquiescence in asiddhi: but the true bhava is ananda in and acceptance of asiddhi as a step towards siddhi. The other therefore is not allowed to establish itself, while the true bhava is as yet obstructed; its basis is not yet properly laid."},{"pageNumber":998,"pageContent":"984 Record of Yoga The movement now is to the fixing of that basis. The progress in samadhi continued. Free chhayamaya of all kinds, though seldom at once the stability and the force of presen- tation. Lapse of memory minimised in sushupti in the perceptive thought (mainly ideal) as well as the vangmaya. Today the ananda has begun to overbear the resistance of prana in the taste. In hearing, smell and touch, there is always the bhoga of ananda, not merely the rasagrahana. The only defect is defect of the chidghana, for the shuddha is always there though often only mental shuddha. But in the taste there is frequently denial of ananda or neutrality. Lipi is rapidly normalising itself in the vivid legibility with an initial perfection of stability. The suggestion is again allowed to play a part in removing the obstruction, but it is always an interpretation of unmanifest lipi rather than a former of uncreated lipi. The lipi is largely spontaneous. The telepathy is beginning to indicate in itself its spontaneous ritam; similarly the ideality even when it manifests in a thick veil or a thick atmosphere of mentality. Some insistence on a spontaneously retentive memory, but the amnesia is still dominant; memory is more active, but retains its usual or capriciously selective character. The insistence on ananda in the taste continues. There is a covert struggle between sleep and the shakti that tries to overcome it. The physical reaction of diminished sleep, is still the stronger, even when the total amount of sleep is the same and the diminution is only of the night sleep. eg. tonight 5 hours (from 2 to 7) after 2 hours in the daytime, making the sufficient quantity of 7 hours.

The chidghana darshana is be- ing founded firmly in the chidghana consciousness, with a firm delineation of vijnanamaya form in all things. The shuddha is shuddha of chidghana, and the premature tendency to insist on the shuddha of ananda is being postponed. The first result was to have shuddha-chidghana of forms, but shuddha ananda with strong envelope of mentality in the surrounding Brahman.

Left to itself in the mentality, it now speedily drops this tendency; but when the telepathy is idealised the resulting brilliance and positiveness gives it the false idea of decisiveness; it tries to supplement the ideal telepathy by the intellectual decision or determining choice. This is the secret of most of the intellectual error of brilliant minds. The ideal telepathy only gives the idea of intentions, forces, facts, possibilities surround- ing the moment of time. Decisive certainty belongs only to the trikaldrishti.

Even when interrupted, it tends to be resumed at the same point or to return to the same subject; this even happens after a long diversion to another subject. It is still, however, a sort of fragmentary coherence. The ideality also works in a fragmentary fashion, except in vangmaya Tapas Lipi , “sixty seventy”. 60 degrees rising to 70 degrees of tapas effectiveness is being enforced in type and has set out to generalise itself. Hitherto tapas effect was all haphazard and incoherent, often strong, seldom perfect, frequently weak or nil, always partial except in details, never or hardly ever final except in certain broad effects after much difficulty Aug 27 Monday. 60º to 70º effectiveness is becoming more general; though 50º and less persist and 80º occasionally occurs, but rarely. The 60º is sometimes in swiftness of overcoming resistance, sometimes in amount of effect, which is often not perfect, but only partial, a 3 – 5 or 4 – 5 effect, especially in tapas of exact circumstance; sometimes in both respects there is only this partial success.

Increase of coherence is the rule. Tuesday Aug 28. The telepathy- tapassiddhi is becoming again idealised in the sense of being seen in its right limits of the satyam in the light of the vijnana; the tapas-siddhi is also acquiring more force with 60º– 70º as the average force, though it falls below and goes above, the latter more often than the former, because of the renewed strength of obstruction.

The old method of forcing undelight in asiddhi on the system from without through the pranic physicality aided by intellectual suggestions and throwing it out from within by the tapas and the buddhi. Pranic manas in its physicality is still compelled to respond, with a slight or evanescent response in its emotivity, but not in its buddhi which does not recognise the undelight as belonging to the system. The freedom of the buddhi from undelight is stronger for the attack; moreover the restoration of the ananda is becoming ahaituka or depends on the tapas and no longer on the buddhi. The habit of return of physical depression is also being elimi- nated, as well as the remnants of susceptibility to the suggestion of desire. Complete asiddhi is contemplated without revolt or depression. There is now commencing an attempt to establish a more last- ing stability in the lipi so that several lines may be manifested simultaneously this has already been done often enough in type, but vanishingly, with a firm hold on the akasha.

Ambulatory ananda is developing very fast, stationary is beginning to make itself normal, the sedentary without regard to asana shows sign also of following suit. The necessity of tapas is disappearing, smarana alone is required, except when the obstruction tries to recover strength; the normal readiness of the physical system for the Ananda may be considered as established. Arogya is still obstructed, subject to relapse and unable to make any large advance. Saundarya is also obstructed. Only psychological yauvana has become almost normal, varying in force and age, but never now settling into v ˆ ardhakya . The pervasive kamananda is now orgiastic in its nature, even when subdued in its force and insufficiently sthula in its hold. The ananda has now taken hold of all positions, recumbent and loose sedentary as well as ambulant, sistory and close sedentary.

Telesiddhi (karma) Telesiddhi takes place frequently in fragments; large, decisive or final success is rare except in telesiddhi of some propinquity. In the main matters the obstruction and opposition are in the mass, though hampered, still successful. Ananda The kamananda seems now to be firmly established as a nor- mal dharma of the body. Continuity and intensity have to be normalised. There is continuity with smarana; continuity without smarana has to be established. Intensity increases with the continu- ity. Ananda wave by strong sparsha on any part of the body is now being taken up; it is kama with admixture of tivra, vaidyuta, raudra. It is at first dependent on smarana and tapas; but in fact the latter is being eliminated; the ananda now as a general rule develops best and most readily when there is smarana without pressure of tapas; the latter, at least if too direct, is even something of an obstacle. Practically this ananda wave by touch has been established in its universality, but the siddhi has now to be entirely confirmed. All this development has taken place in the course of five minutes or so, with the vertiginous rapidity. Ananda of acute discomfort has for some time been developing and is now preparing to be confirmed and perfected. In samadhi stronger grip of observing ideality on narrative and dialogue.

Strength of ideal lipi in the samadhi. Sept 2. Sunday. Obstruction in all the siddhis and attempt to enforce relapse yesterday and today. In the first it is unsuccessful except for fleeting and increasingly unsubstantial touches. In the second it lowers the force of tertiary dasya in the third degree and keeps in abeyance the ishwarabhava and the intenser sraddha. In the third it forces back the ideality and keeps up the dead play of the disjointed intellectual mentality, as well as the direct sense of the Ishwara control. In the fourth it tries to keep up the old stereotyped rule of denial of siddhi after a day of exceptional siddhi in the kamananda and enforce vismriti on the body; it is only partially successful[;] it diminishes and interrupts but cannot suspend. The process of changing separated telepathy and tapas into united T 2 is being given a new turn. This is to give always the decisive event first as at once trikaldrishti and tapas, and attend afterwards to the movements which try to contradict the decreed and foreseen result and those which help with the aids and mod- ifications of the opposing forces to bring it about. For the latter purpose it is being attempted to universalise the ideal light in the telepathies. The difficulty is always to distinguish the real finality from something that imitates it and to seize the right measure of the telepathies. The force of possession of the telepathies by the ideality is as yet insufficient, the interference of the mentality yet too frequent to allow of this invariable certainty.

Tapas effectivity in the environment tends towards greater normality of 70º, greater frequency of 80º, but this tendency is not yet well established. This effectivity however does not extend to exact detail of circumstance in which asiddhi both of will and eventual knowledge is the rule, siddhi the rare exception. Telepathy of contributory force, tendency, intention, impulse etc is sufficiently exact, though not always sufficiently complete. Contributory tapas is becoming illumined in the same way as telepathy, in its satyam and increasingly in its ritam . But decisive tapas like decisive vision and even more is still unillumined or insufficiently illumined. On the whole the vijnanamaya is now well-grounded and the rule of the being, but very far from perfection. Tivra seems to have gone slightly back, but this is only the emergence of tendencies which had been held down by the energy of the tapas, not quite eliminated, though diminished and depressed. The habit of fluctuation from greater to less and from less to greater response has to be got rid of. Moreover the intimacy of the response has to be secured, that is to say, the inherent excitability of the phys- ical system responding immediately to the sparsha by an intimate and intense thrill. At present this excitability is lost by prolonged excitation and replaced by an unsteady communicated excitability. Moreover the necessity of tapas has to be eliminated and smarana made sufficient. In kamananda this necessity is already recognised, and the advance is therefore retarded in order to get it satisfied There is now increasing frequency of tapas-siddhi in exact circumstance, often sustained, varying from 70º, 75º, to 80º, but also sinking to 60º. Below 60º the normal, though not invariable rule is asiddhi.

The lipi is now fixed normally in the highest ideality. Kamananda has resumed its action of continuity. It is notice- able that pressure of tapas is eliminated, although an original act of tapas-memory is still sometimes used to set it in action. Smarana is still necessary except sometimes in the most habituated asanas. There is some indication of the fut ure substitution of a partial or side attention for smarana, but this is not yet anything more than an unrealised intention in the system. Rupa is active to some extent in the jagrat, but there is no ascertainable progress. Friday Sept 7. There is a more settled ritam in the telepathy and tapas working in the unillumined or partially illumined mentality. The increase in effectivity of tapas seems now to be settled and normal. The development of this movement continued throughout the day has been the one feature of its siddhi. Also the return of the Ishwara control Saturday Sept 8 The substitution of the necessity of half-attention for the neces- sity of smarana in orgiastic kamananda is taking place; it is already strongly established in the type. At first it was only sufficient for the sustaining of the ananda, not for its inception after cessation or its assertion against obstruction; but the sufficiency of the half- attention for initiating or renewing the ananda is now established. All this is in type; much has to be done before it can be universalised. In the end even this will not be necessary.

The excentric waves and currents of kamananda are following rapidly the same development as the main or central surge; they have to come to depend first on smarana without tapas though at first with an implied tapas in it, then on a half-attention, while the removal of even this necessity is being already prepared. Here too maintenance without full smarana is easier and more frequent than inception or even renewal. These excentric currents are often ahaituka, that is, not created as before only by actual sparsha. There are signs that ahaituka tivra will also be soon prepared for normality. At present it is still dependent except in the three main locations where half- smarana is already sufficient, on the full smarana and usually on smaranatapas . Vaidyuta is developing indistinctly along with the tivra and kama . Separate development of vaidyuta and raudra seems to have been postponed. Intense continuous ahaituka tivra is being prepared and estab- lished in type in all the nine locative centres; it is already done in type in the seven main and is begun in the two subordinate centres. The discursive tivra, which once emerged, is now being encouraged to reappear. Note that there are three other subordinate centres of the third class in which the same preparation is being indicated.

In the rest obstructive denial or successful resistance are paramount, denial in 8 and 9, resistance in the Arogya. The half smarana is now often reduced to a minimum of at- tention chiefly in the physical mind or even the mind of the body and the dependence of the Ananda on the attention begins to be replaced by the involuntary Ananda forcing the attention. But this is only occasionally. Usually greater or less smarana is required. If the mind is vacant, then the attention can sink to the minimum. If it is concentrated on any object or subject, the ananda either sinks and ceases or is kept in abeyance and resumed with full force on the cessation of the absorption. A new circumstance is the pervasion of the pranic body by the ananda as well as, with a less forcefulness of sensation, the manasic body. In the latter, at the highest, it is pure madhu of the Soma. All the anandas show signs of an increasing tendency to the orgiastic Monday Sept 10. A strong attempt by the artificial obstruction to renew its power of strongly suspending the Ananda; at times almost suc- cessful, it has decisively failed. The ananda in the pranic body has now the power of taking possession of the physical. Kamananda diminished in force of continuity and frequency, but not suspended. The obstruction is no longer able to suspend it strongly and imperatively as before. Its occasional control is becoming more and more artificial and its strength to obstruct more and more laboured.

The lipi now perfectly founded in the highest ideality, is aiming at perfect fluidity on that level. It is easier in the chitra than in the akasha lipi, though even there there is some difficulty of immedi- ate physical manifestation.

A certain lethargy of the vijnana action which has been dom- inant for some days, is now in process of being removed. It is noticeable that even the intellectual action is really a perfectly ac- curate action of the ideality except in T 3 , but its perfection is only realised when the ideal perception, ketu, stands above to observe it. Even in T 3 the action would be perfect in its justice, if the remnant intellect judgment would not misinterpret and misemphasise it Kamananda is increasing in the type its force of involuntary initiation and involuntary retention or repetition.

The lipi predicts the return of that vital force into the new ideal principle. At present vital force is often at a minimum due to the excessive force of shama which was necessary to purification.

Sept 15 The poise of the Brahmadarshana in things has changed rapidly, suddenly from the vijnanamaya with Ananda in it to the Ananda full with vijnana. It is only in beings that the lower poises are still strong. It only needs the sense of the infinite Ananda in each thing to be added and the darshana will be completely founded. This is already being prepared and is partially active even in regard to persons. T 3 has been rapidly prepared this morning for the ideal control. It is only when the physical brain relaxes into failure to respond or when there are too rapid suggestions from the external intellectu- ality that the ideal reception fails. Even the intellectual ideality is now losing all its credit, because of its failure to satisfy the needs of the siddhi, especially the ritam. Great incoherence in the reading. The other powers of samadhi maintain their ideality or at least their coherence, though some- times with an initial difficulty. In rupa and reading the sadhana is up against the curious phenomenon which seems insuperable in jagrat rupa, vishaya, and the physical siddhi other than ananda, the stereotyped difficulty, the action of the Vedic Nidah ,which consists in the eternal repetition of the past movements of success and failure forming a circle which refuses to be broken. In all the siddhi this phenomenon has been active, but most obstinately in certain members of the sadhana.

Ananda darshana moves between suddha ananda proper and the same in the ananda vijnana or ananda manas . Sometimes it falls back into vijnana or mentality. This falling back is due to the recoil from the attempt to realise the infinite Ananda not only in but behind each finite, for which the mentality is not ready and therefore falls back into some fine or coarse mental representation of the thing desired by the will and sometimes, but insecurely seized in the knowledge.

Feb 15 T 3 is definitely turning itself into vijnana. The final step must be to turn the intelligent mind from the recipient and judge which it is now into a channel, so that the ideality will no longer send its messages into the lower mind, but work in itself for itself, with itself as its own observer and judge. This is now being undertaken. Hitherto it is the active activity of the intelligent mind which has had to be eliminated by a long progression of advances and relapses; now it is the passive activity which must also go. It is only in the tapas that the active activity still makes any noteworthy attempt to persist. Lipi is now entirely idealised. It is attempting to stabilise per- fectly its spontaneous legibilities. This stability is becoming more and more frequent, pronounced and ample; but when the tapas is not applied, the old confusion, indistinctness and evanescence still tend to predominate. The truth of the lipi is now continually being justified by results. Trikaldrishti proper is developing (until now all has been really intelligent and telepathic); but all is being arranged first in the lower intuitional vijnana, not in the higher revelatory and inspirational ideality. In physical siddhi Kamananda is progressing rapidly. Today for the first time there was settled unmoving ahaituka kamananda pervading the whole body, somasya hradah .

Lipi increases in legibility and stability in antardarshi, where confusion was formerly the law. It is noticeable that as the samadhi gets deeper, vividness and stability increase. The interpretation of the lipi is now being done entirely by the vijnana; but definite trikaldrishti with time, circumstance etc is still to seek, except as regards the sadhana.

The sadhana has now to eliminate (1) confused or indistinct lipi; (2) incomplete expres- sion. This done the rest is a matter of intensity of inspirational and revelatory speech, which is already beginning to become com- mon. Vijnana thought is now inspirational and revelatory as well as intuitional, but chiefly in the intuitional form. The rule is established that there shall be first knowledge, then tapas in accordance with the will, reversing the former order in which tapas came first and then it was questioned whether it should be fulfilled. Feb 18. Confusion is being got rid of in the lipi; indistinctness remains. It is only in the imperfect lipis that these things exist, but even there confusion is rapidly disappearing. The habit of intuitional interpretation, especially of suggestive lipi where it is most difficult, is being confirmed. In express lipi it is becoming the rule. Rupasiddhi is manifesting the perfect as well as the devel- oped forms; but for the former the old defects persist, (1) side manifestation, (2) want of stability, (3) want of variety for it is almost entirely in the type form, though with variety in that narrow limit.

It is finally seen even by the intelligence that there can be here no absolute certainty of foresight or result, since it is the play of partial, conflicting and mutually self-adjusting tendencies, forces, ideas, impulses. The telepathy of these things and the understanding of them is becoming wider, subtler, more ac- curate, though far yet from being perfect and complete. Meanwhile T 3 is suspended. T 2 is postponed.

But the effect has been only temporary. Variety is returning to the rupa, but only, as before, in the crude forms. Feb 19. Samadhi after a long time recovered its activity. The ideal lipi chatusthaya is founded; vangmaya thought is freely active on all four states of the mentality; ideal perceptive thought has initiated itself in the three inner states as well as the one outer. The rest is still mental only; but there was the seed today for reading, narrative, dialogue. Rupa was active only in the vague chhayamaya. All this was done in a rush, by the exclusion, almost though not quite complete, of sleep. Henceforth sushupti must mean the Yogic sleep of the mind with wakefulness of the vijnana. Lipi is advancing continuously and rapidly. It has become all intuitional lipi to the exclusion of the telepathic ideality though prediction of material events may be an exception. It is becoming distinct in an orderly completeness, and now fluid in a legible and spontaneous legibility. This has not yet been universalised, but it is becoming a general rule. Both sahaituka and ahaituka raudrananda are advancing. The burning touch is entirely anandamaya, except when it is so con- tinued as to be intolerable, but even then in certain forms and up to a certain degree, a high degree, it remains anandamaya. There are signs of a similar progression, not yet so far advanced in the m ˆ arana Five forms of raudra karshana, apakarshana, prakarshana, apikarshana, sankarshana Strong relapse in T 2 still persists.

For the last two days ahaituka k. much subjected to violent suppression to its minimum point and easily interrupted, sahaituka obstructed. Smarana can always restore the former to action and generally but not always to intensity. It is mainly while walking that the adverse movement takes place. Nevertheless the intensity is increasing both in force and in general level and in power of sus- tained continuity. The habit of interruption is the one real difficulty in ahaituka k. In rupa perfectly developed and perfect forms now show, es- pecially the former, a certain power of stability, but they arise from long tratak on the living object as their excuse or starting-point, though not their real cause, and they are confined to the type form, chiefly in the three varieties most commonly watched. A clear ideal (intuitional) trikaldrishti is now acting, but it has to be firmly distinguished from the less certain vision of the mental and pranic superplanes which sometimes come in its place and sometimes are mixed with it. Moreover it is isolated and gives only the general result without time, place or circumstance of intermedi- ate event. Tapas siddhi is still manasic, but has greatly increased in force for general, and even though much less, for particular result. The power varies from 10º or 20º to 60º. A higher force is rare, except in moving objects, where it sometimes reaches 80º Unity of Trikaldrishti (telepathic and intuitional) and tapas has been roughly accomplished.

Perfect stability only in two or three type forms, but an initial stability is striving to fix itself in the others. The rupas are not yet always complete or perfect. Vangmaya, vani, script suddenly taken up in full by the Ish- wara. Inspirational ideality begins in the lipi and is already as com- mon as the intuitional. Lipi begins to justify its trikaldrishti eg with regard to the situation in Roumania, viz that the principle had already been settled, to yield after a little velleity of resistance. It is notable that the telepathic interpretation of the situation was correct. The perfect lipi with well developed stability is becoming more normal. The style of the thought vangmaya is becoming more and more illumined and inspirational. The intuitional lipi is oftenest perfect with difficulty, it has not except at its best an immediate stability, legibility, spontaneity; the inspirational has it normally; the slower manifestation is excep- tional to it. It is even sometimes instantaneously perfect as if in the flash. It is now however taking up the intuitional lipi. Free manifestation of chhayamaya rupa in swapna-samadhi at night; stable forms, scenes, etc, continuous action. Even in one case the supreme stability of vivid scene, but with a certain chanchalya of motion in the scene and appearing and disappearing of figures. Strong stability of reading in one case.

The intelligence is being pushed aside as the judge and recipi- ent; it still persists, but is being dominated. It is the intuitive mind that is taking its place, while in the thought etc it is mostly the ideality itself that is the judge and recipient. Lipi trikaldrishti is now being constantly fulfilled. After taking up telepathies into the intuitive mind and observ- ing there all the relative uncertain certainties of the mental, vital and physical planes, so as to give them their right incidence and root out false stress, a rapid summing up of the movement of the last few days, the intuitional trikaldrishti has founded itself. The intellectual action with regard to T 3 is now only a habit-survival which must progressively be discouraged and eliminated. In samadhi large masses of reading and a persistent attempt to decipher, but only brief clauses or phrases decipherable, sepa- rate or in the mass. These however, are becoming more common. Development is also proceeding in the other deficient parts. Feb. 23. The union of T 2 is becoming closer, but there is strong resis- tance to the development of the intuitional ideality. It is, however, progressing. Full variety in crude rupa. The tendency to clear completeness and stability does not yet fix itself; and all is done against great obstruction. Inspirational ideality entirely takes the place of intuitional in the vangmaya and establishes itself in the perceptive thought; only the lower telepathic thought is intuitional.

Great play of rupa in the evening of all kinds, but imperfect except in crude and in the rest only when seen indirectly or sadhara (sthapatya) etc or in type forms. Stability is yet unattained and variety in the perfect forms is only promising to develop. Sudden lipi perfect in form is becoming frequent. Feb 26.

The attempt to decide by other means than the inspirational vijnana, whether by knowledge or will, is not entirely eliminated, but is now far advanced, and prevails only in moments of forgetfulness. As yet it is only to the extent of the old T 3 which was far from complete that this success obtains, but it is ex- tending itself to the whole range of possible intelligent thought and will, to complete the brihat satyam ritam.

Above a certain point, the first impression is pain, though ananda immediately intervenes and takes possession. In subsequent effects pain mingles, but the tendency is for ananda to prevail. The general receptive attitude of the physical being is anandamaya and this is rapidly prevailing. The intelligence has not only lost, but renounced its right to judge; but it is still involuntarily the recipient in the lower mental system and even by habit in the thought, except when the latter acts as if by a sort of force in the inspirational ideality. The ideal action has not yet become natural to the whole being. The result was a temporary inability to act subjectively, a sunk quietude.

Both forms of thought have replaced, when the ideality is active, the inferior by the middle or inspirational vijnana, which holds in itself revelation and has taken up intuition and viveka. Trikaldrishti is in course of transformation. The middle ideality has a surer certainty and lends itself less to the relapses of the intuitive intelligence.

Spontaneous lipi flows less readily, but this also is preparing to associate with itself the other qualities. Interpretation of the lipi is now really ideal with a spontaneous judgment ( gnwrisic ). There is still a habit of confusion when the mass of outflow is left to itself, but this is mainly in the chitra-lipi. This progress is in the bahirdarshi; lipi in the rest is still imperfectly developed. All this has been done in a few days. 22 d April. The development of the lipi and a certain development of the ideality the sea-god in the ideality is making itself common to bahirdarshi, antardarshi and swapna, but as yet with less force and ripeness of large action in the two last. In the jagrat there is an action of tapas which is at last quite freed from the personal element and perceives all its willings as actions of knowledge and has even begun to distinguish with a commencement of automatic fidelity those which will realise themselves from those which will remain as yet unfulfilled tendencies, impulses or intentions.

What is now coming, is an automatic fidelity to truth, a fidelity not of the telepathic stress in the intuitive intelligence, but of the intuitively revelatory judgment in the ideality. This is as yet very imperfect in its action and still involved in the intellectual telepathies. 25 th April After two or three days of a confused action, the intuitively revelatory judgment has disengaged itself and is extending its ac- tion. As yet it applies only to tapas and telepathies. As regards the latter it sometimes replaces them, that is, it takes them up idealised and accompanies them with the ideal judgment, so that they are entirely correct ideal and not doubtful mental telepathies, or it observes and judges them, or there is a mixed action. The latter has to be eliminated as an evident source or pratistha of error. With regard to the tapas, it is the impersonal perception of what has to happen, because that is what is being definitively willed in the ideal Vijnana; at present it is correct with the substance of the ideal Truth, but not often clearly luminous with the light of the ideal Truth. This is because it leans on what is being willed in the present, but does not go back to what stands as willed in the Eternal Idea. There is as yet much tendency to attendant intellectual hesitation and error of circumstance, where the fulfilment is not immediate, but this is being eliminated. The action of the ideal Truth as applied to present status of invisible objects is not yet developed beyond the telepathic action. What the ideal T 2 is now working on, is the present tendency and future action of visible objects. 30 th April.

It rejects the remnants of the intellectual fragmentation and division which still come to deny its completeness. Ananda of samata has proved sufficiently firm throughout the month. It is now combined firmly with the tapas; desire has per- ished, though tapatya still remains, but only as a minor element. Therefore the touches of asamata can get no hold, are entirely external and are cast out of the adhar automatically as soon as they enter. External, moreover, not of any near, but of a distantly watching, rather than environing mentality. Tapas is now very strong; in the field of exercise the obstacle has no longer a genuine power of resistance, but only of persistence and this again persists only by a persistent recurrence which gives it after much difficulty the power for a time to reestablish itself rather than by a right of its own in the environment. This is even when the tapas is without knowledge of trikaldrishti. The movement has now begun which will turn Time from an obstacle with which the personal Tapas had to struggle into an instrument which the personal Tapas, become that of the transcendent will working upon the universal to modify it as well as through the universal, will use for the disposition of its results.

All is being idealised in the samadhi, but the dialogue, narra- tive etc are still usually mental, swapnamaya, though much more sustained and coherent. Reading is still normally incoherent. All are occasionally ideal. Lipi is always ideal, but is less perfected in its eightfold quality and less free and spontaneously active in the antardarshi than in the bahirdarshi. Rupa and vishaya in the bahirdarshi are still unable to take firm hold of the etheric system. On the whole the “liberty in the idealities” (lipi, 21 st April) is working itself out, but does not cover the whole third chatusthaya and is nowhere quite absolute. May May 1 st Lipi predicted today perfect ideality and the beginning of physical delight; but it is only the seed of the perfect ideality and the definite beginning of physical delight in the tivra that the interpretation relying on the mental pre-sentiment admitted. It is this which has actually evolved, but as a beginning in both cases of a steadier final development, of the perfect ideality including T 2 and of the total physical delight in all five anandas. May 4 th Saturday Yesterday the siddhi in the sahaituka tivra developed beyond all mistake an incipient finality of development. First, an universal- ity of the tivra response to any touch however slight, and even a general mass response even to such habitual sparsha as the close pressure of the cloth at the loins usually unfelt and the loose pres- sure on the legs. This tivra contains the vishaya and develops the kama, as is now seen, today. This triple movement is preparing to become a law, but as yet sometimes the vishaya prevails over the tivra, sometimes the tivra alone remains, or else the vishaya is at once the kama without any intermediate tivra. The tendency however is for all vishaya to become tivra. At the same time an abundant ahaituka raudra is beginning to manifest even while the sahaituka is pressing to generalise itself.

Kama has for a long time been most vehemently resisted and suppressed partly because it has been the most demanded by the mental tapas and has therefore attracted the mass of the physical opposition, partly because it is the most central and vital of all the Anandas. It is now pressing to remanifest more securely, but has not yet got rid of the suppression, though that is steadily becoming less effective. All this justifies the lipi “today total delight”, the truth of which was doubted by the intelligence because to the mental perception the physical opposition to the kamananda seemed too strong to be surmounted. The script set down yesterday. “The first week of May outlines the ritam in the satyam brihat. It prepares the totality of the physical delight. It prepares too the samadhi.” All three predictions are being fulfilled with what has been called the enthusiastic, that is a sudden, vehement and anandamaya rapidity. In the samadhi today continuous vangmaya and ideal ideation was established, the habit of fatigue in the physical mind which demanded cessation or intermission being denied its claim and dismissed. The habit of simultaneous action of the two which has hitherto been violently or obstina tely resisted by the physical mind, was firmly founded and illustrated by a rich continuity of simulta- neous action. Initially the habit of simultaneous manifestation of the lipi in the antardarshi and even in the swapna , where it has been the most difficult, was immediately afterwards founded, in the same stream of rapid progress. The lipi in the antardarshi is now assuming the same freedom and perfection of the eightfold quality as in the bahirdarshi , only it is still rather more resisted by the physical ether, its manifestation less free, prompt and fluid in completeness, its stability more initial and less definitive. Ideal ideation is driving out the dull habit of intellectual thought in the samadhi along with the physical fatigue; it has been busy with its electric needleplay modifying the physical mind, in its sukshma brain-stuff even when no definite ideation was at work."},{"pageNumber":1059,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1045 The same movement has begun in the outward waking mind; it is extending first to a confident play of the ideal telepathy, that is what was the intelligences perception of present intention, ten- dency, possibility etc. This is now firm in the satyam brihat, except for actual situation etc of objects where the tamasic darkness of the external intelligence opposes the action of a power which has already been established in the mental telepathy, but has yet to be established in the ideal. T 2 today is developing the play of the uni- versal ideal perception and tapas and for the first time manifested the transcendent Tapas and idea which predestines and decides. This is evidently the first beginning of that perfection which, it has been declared, will be made final in July. That this may be done so rapidly, the lethargy habit has to be abolished, as the lipi has predicted, that is, the demand of the physicality for cessation and intermission, its refusal to respond to the tapas and idea which was the real though hidden basis for the habit of long cessation and relapse which the sadhana has been struggling with and at last gradually eliminating, recently quite rapidly, during the last seven years. It is still strong in the physical sadhana; therefore there is there except in the Ananda, only a slow and laboured and intermittent progress, though in some directions still a steady progress, and in some respects only a defensive denial of farther active asiddhi relapse, in others a balance of relapse and reparation with a slight gain sometimes for the siddhi, sometimes for the asiddhi. It is in utthapana and saundarya that the asiddhi is strongest, in arogya the siddhi for the most part holds its own and even has had definite particular victories and advances; in Ananda it is hampered, but now on the verge of a general triumphant progress, even engaged in its actual inception.

There is a considerable increase in frequency of the transcen- dent idea-tapas but the rest of T 2 has been acting through the intelligence this morning therefore uncertainly and without clear light. The chief advance has been in effectivity of vashita for partic- ular effect, but the movement, though not without strength is only initial. The main cause of the descent has been a general physical lassitude which has been indulged to a certain extent. Fatigue has begun now to be excluded from the mind, the psychic prana and the prana upholding the action of the body and confined to the body and the physical prana directly involved in the body. Action of the body can go on in spite of the fatigue in the muscles, but the general effect of the latter can still throw a general effect on the upholding prana, not precisely of fatigue, but of lassitude in the virya . The only imperative effect is the reaction of muscular strain Tivra has now established the rule of increase by excitation; but this modified by a continued habit of intermediate deadening or diminution of response. The rule in continuous excitation of response with interstices of deadening or diminution followed by renewed and in the end increased response is being supplanted by the habit of sustained response; but the substitution is not yet complete. Prolongation of response after cessation of touch and rep- etition after cessation, the latter sometimes an often repeated and almost continuous repetition, is rapidly coming in; so also the habit of sympathetic response, after cessation. Pervading vaidyuta has begun, but is not yet strong in its hold or intense. The intensity is however increasing.

Dream is now normally consecutive and coherent, though not invariably. It still has, however, the nature of phantasy. May 6 th Tapatya is being exiled steadily from the action of T 2 . Tapatya is the straining to know and fulfil; it is not in itself desire, but the cause of desire in the prana and heart; desire being banished, tapatya has remained as an illegitimate prolongation and stress of what is received in the ideality, it is mental tapas, bringing false stress and falsification of values. Although not a cause of grief and disappointment like desire, it is a cause of false hope and false doubt and also of undue pravritti and undue nivritti of mental action and as a result of temperamental and physical action. It is being driven out by the establishment of the transcendent idea-will of which the universal tendencies and movements become the effective media and results. At first this tends to bring an excessive passivity of the instrumental Jiva, but this is a defect which is in the course of being remedied. Tapatya took up the communications of the idea will and personalised them into a mental effort, belief, hope in the instrumental Jiva. They have, where necessary, to be personalised but as part of the personality of the Ishwara creating in the Jiva ideal sraddha and pravritti. The day has been one chiefly of obstruction, only minor progress made. Fluency with incoherence in the newly progress- ing parts of the samadhi. Tejomaya rupa is frequent in swapna samadhi, but it is instable or imperfectly stable, without hold on the chidakasha.

The defect that has to be got rid of throughout the ideality, is the descent of the vijnana into mind. This makes the intellect the receptive agency which creates a sort of receptive intellectual judgment, assent and denial, a cause of error and uncertainty. It prolongs the old defects, especially in T 2 , the defect of taking (1) inactual possibilities, (2) actual tendencies and possibilities as definite trikaldrishti. The first is not frequent and has no imperative power, the second is still the chief cause of positive error, although it is less powerfully insistent than it was formerly. The removal of this defect begins today. It is prolonged by the rhathumia ,the leaving things to take care of themselves instead of insisting by the ideal tapas upon perfection. It gives an undue force to the etheric resistance in the physicality and prevents the full liberation of the ideality to act largely and perfectly. When it is absent, there is an anandamaya certainty. The script has laiddown for May inthe physical siddhi (May 5) (1) primary utthapana, to be pressed steadily and laid down in the base; (2) a distinct general advance in arogya; (3) a struggle with old age and asaundarya; (4) a complete fivefold physical ananda. All these necessarily to be only an initial movement. For today the script runs “The liberation of the ideality is to be completed today within certain limits. T 2 will take a little more time; so will ef- fectivity of tapas in rupasiddhi and vishaya.” Nothing is said here about the samadhi. The liberation of the ideality is being effected by two move- ments; (1) elimination of the intellectual response, involving a physi- cal movement by which the thought ceases to descend into the area of the mental brain-stuff in the sukshma body environing the brain in the physical body and acts from the junction of the sukshma mind and the vijnana above the head, upon and above the sahasradala;"},{"pageNumber":1063,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1049 (2) substitution of the inspirational for the intuitional stuff in the ideality. This has been done already in speech thought and ideation; it is still to be done in T 2 , though there too it is done within certain limits. Rupasiddhi has begun today with a more ideal tapas, but as yet no definitive progress has been made in the forms. Rupasid- dhi also has eight qualities to be perfected, spontaneity, stability, vividness, rapidity, fluidity, completeness, variety, coherence, and a ninth, truth (ie, point, right relation, utility) corresponding to the “light” and “justice” in the lipi qualities. Vishaya shows no tendency to develop beyond its persistent limitations. There is no longer any difficulty about maintaining the ideal liberty in the speech thought, it is normal; there is still difficulty in the ideation, it is only becoming normal. Lipi is perfect in sadhara and niradhara, normally; it is still difficult to maintain perfection or even to enforce it in the chitra lipi and sthapatya lipi. The absolute perfection comes most easily in the niradhara; but in none is there entire freedom from the resistance of the physical ether to the perfect manifestation. Some force of tapas is always required; left to itself the ether yields always ideal lipi, but in an imperfect form. For the second week of May the script runs. “The second week of May is more important than the first. What was begun in the first, will be made effective in the second, that is, free ideality, abundance and accuracy of T 2 , evolution of physical ananda, idealisation of t he samadhi. In addition rupasiddhi and vishaya will break the long obstruction which has prevented their evolution. Other results will outline themselves during the week.” Physical ananda is once more active; the kama is overcoming the obstruction and it is developing a new movement which shows that even in the physical movements there is such a thing as the ideal and the mental action. That is to say, the ananda hitherto manifested even if in its origin supramental, was supported by the"},{"pageNumber":1064,"pageContent":"1050 Record of Yoga intelligent mind or at the best by the intuitive mind, while what is now manifesting is ideal delight in the body. That was mixed in its character, modified by the lower physical reaction, this is pure and sovereign and has taken up the physical reaction into the ideality; it is self-existent even when sahaituka. The sparsha only awakens, it does not produce it. A similar distinction is prefigured in the arogya but is not as yet practically defined. May 8 The first week of May has fulfilled the outline of progress laid down for it, a preparation within certain limits. It has effected a great liberation in speech thought, ideation and lipi and not only outlined, but laid down here the clear and strong ideal ritam in the satyam brihat, fixing it for the present mainly in the inspirational form or at the lowest in an intuitional form truly ideal and not intellectualised. Sometimes the old intellectualised form still recurs, but this is an exception without power or sanction in the nature. In T 2 it has done no more than prepare, but it has got [rid] 2 of desire in the tapas and diminished the force of tapatya: it has put the telepathies in their right place and tried to make the field clear for the real trikaldrishti; it has also laid down the right relation between the transcendent and the universal in this action of the ideality. But as yet the nature has not perfectly accommodated itself to the ideal law. The physicality persists in besieging the system with the old imperfect action. Lipi is fixed in the ideality, but has only established the formal perfection in the type frequently occurring, it has not as yet successfully universalised it, though for a time it seemed on the point of an almost complete success.

It has not yet any force of pervasion or the massed intensity and enthusiasm of former accesses of kamananda. This has come subsequently, a pronounced and pervasive ananda. At first proceeding from the centre to pervade the lower parts of the body and occupying, from thence rising to pervade the upper parts to the brain. It was only by application of tapas that the contrary movement was induced; but it is a noteworthy instance of the tendency of the physicality to make laws of imperfections which are in their origin only temporary movements and stages in the complete evolution, that the normalising of this latter movement and the full occupation by it is still resisted and is not so complete as that of the former. This kamananda is long continuous, but not entirely continuous; it has however already the habit of constant return. It can be continued into samadhi, but there tends to drop away. In samadhi of all depths an abundant play of lipi is now established. It is ideal, almost but not entirely free, but not yet perfect in the eightfold quality.

Some difficulty is found in preventing even vangmaya thought from descending into the [intellectuality]. 4 Still the pure inspira- tional is rapidly developing freedom and normality and the frequent descent tends to stop at intuitional ideality, without now the descent into the intellect and even this is now a secondary and no longer a chief movement. It is noticeable that even what might be called the subconscient telepathy, for that is what it was once, and it is still really that emerging to the surface of the sense mind, is beginning to become idealised. This is a great step in advance and a promise of the total idealisation of the mind-stuff. The inspirational ideality prevails more and more and has de- veloped rapidly a higher revelatory substance, but the divergence has brought an unease and want of ananda into the mental system. This has been used as a discouragement to the intellectual thought when it comes because it creates a positive physical unease, but this use is contrary to the ideal method all whose means must be anandamaya. The ideality does not need the reactions of the old mental method to assist its progress; it can go on more rapidly and satisfactorily without them by its perception of truth and its own force to fulfil it.

The ideation tries to follow the movements of the speech thought; but it is more back- ward and owing to its past habit of conversion into intellectual thought unable to effect the same progress as successfully. It is noticeable that the difficulty is greater in samadhi than in the outward jagrat, which is also a reversion to a former state of things. Samadhi is now divided into two parts, the lighter forms in which the purusha is wakeful and ideality reigns, the deeper in which nidra reigns and the action is intellectual with much of the old incoherence. But now in this nidra the purusha is wakeful though in a swapnamaya fashion and the intellectuality is nearer to ideality and is sometimes idealised. It is on the point of conversion to the ideality. In this nidra kavya has suddenly made itself frequent. Sparsha is increasing in swapna and even trying to enter into antardarshi The ideation and speech thought have now effected the requi- site conversion and the force of the ideality in them can be trusted to complete it and remove or transform the unconverted elements or tendencies that still remain. T 2 is now turning to make the same conversion and has begun it, but here the intellectual confusion and chaos of mental telepathies has been so great, though now partly cleared, that time is required to make the conversion equally effective. The true revelatory thought has begun to manifest in the lipi, but with an absorbing inspirational form of itself or with a strong and too heavy intuitional tendency. The highest and subtlest form of it is not yet manifest This revelatory thought has at once extended itself to the speech thought both in the jagrat and the antardarshi and swapna samadhis, and to a less extent to the ideation. Nowhere does it occupy the field, but it is already dominant everywhere. Lipi now well established in antardarshi and swapna, even the deepest, is now insisting against great opposition on (1) perfectly free manifestation with no obstruction from the lethargy of the"},{"pageNumber":1068,"pageContent":"1054 Record of Yoga ether, (2) perfect manifestation in possession of all its eight qualities.

(3) Samadhi developing the undeveloped parts in a mass. (4) Kamananda settled (5) Ideality progressing in the revelatory thought. T 2 at present has to deal with the following component situation. 1. The largest element to be dealt with is the old telepathic in- tellectual perceptions. These now are unable to insist on themselves and are no longer false trikaldrishtis, but perceptions of thought, tendency, intention, impulse, either belonging to the object or work- ing on it from the environmental physical Virat or from the pranic and mental planes. Yesterday the inspirational thought was busy observing them and giving them their right place and scope. They have to be replaced by the intuitional telepathies. 2. The next largest element is the intuitional perceptions which are real[ly] telepathic, but which the intellect tried to represent by overstress as definite trikaldrishti of future action. These are now putting on their ritam and have begun to figure as accurate intu- itions of present tendency etc and immediate or closely subsequent future action. This telepathic trikaldrishti of the future, however, can only be definitive if approved by the higher revelatory or in- spirational ideality. Moreover they are vague about time and not quite full in circumstance. 3. Blind or unluminous inspirational thought of trikaldrishti- tapas, ie indicatory inspirations without farther discernment of detail or aspect, limit or scope, and without light of the revelation.

There have been three recurring stages always of this Ananda, (1) prevalent obstruction refusing the Ananda even to the tapas, except occasionally, (2) the obstruction broken down by satapas smarana, Ananda recurring but intermittent though with periods of continuity, (3) constant Ananda dependent on nistapas smarana, but varying in intensity, sometimes full, sometimes only an impression, not definite Ananda. What has to be developed is ni[h]smarana Ananda, that is enforcing itself on the sense in the body even without smarana. This is now acting in the sahaituka The sahaituka creates a stronger deposit of ahaituka; but this tends to diminish and fade away. When this tendency ceases, the Ananda will be perfectly founded. The strong intense sahaituka still leaves a doubt whether the body is capable of bearing and therefore holding its indefinite prolongation and increase. This dharana-samarthya also must be determined in order to ensure permanence. When it is fixed, Ananda will help to enforce perfect arogya on the body. The transformation of all telepathy into intuitional ideality is proceeding rapidly.

The latter has to be entirely eliminated, the former strengthened and made dominant. The vaguer parts of roga, not those that still have a strong and definite hold on the body, are being brought forward, evidently for the ideal tapas to begin to deal with them. If this is done, the arogya as well as the Ananda will be brought within the field of the new ideal activity. The elimination of the intellectual atmosphere of the telepathy has begun. It will take time, but the difficulty is not so great as at first appears or as past experience would lead one to think, for the mentality now pervading the body is intuitive and not intellectual- vital; the intellectual element and atmosphere are brought in from outside, from the environmental mind. The concession given to the intellectuality, led to a renewed intellectual interruption, but this has been very rapidly remedied, and it has served its turn in establishing a real will in the intellectual devatas in the environmental mind to seek for their own idealisation instead of resisting the idealisation of the adhar. Both smarana of kamananda and ni[h]smarana ahaituka and sahaituka are becoming easy and frequent in samadhi. Even some initial continuity has shown itself. The Ananda has now only to overcome the tendencies of discontinuation to be fixed. In Samadhi there was a massed development, in strong and firm type, of ideality in kavya, dialogue, narrative, reading etc; a first movement turning these from ideal phantasy into truth of a definite aim and utility in the purpose of the divine Yoga, at least in one first instance of combined reading and lipi (Indian News . . nerv. [ . . . ]); also a first instance of strong, though partial legibility in persistent mass lipi, with however the defect that its persistence did not amount to legible stability. Kavya developed remarkably, eg “What swoon has brought The key of many immortalities?” But the farther progress was hampered by the after effects of the intellectual reaction, as the thought-action in the intellect hampered the revelatory thought from acting."},{"pageNumber":1071,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1057 The physical anandas no longer as a principle of action re- place, prevent or interfere with each other, but all seem to help the kamananda. The kamananda suffers not only from the old defects of diminution and discontinuity, but from its other old defect of in- sufficiency in ambulando. There seems however to be on the whole a much greater force of continuity than on former occasions. The intensity of the mornings sahaituka has not been repeated. There is strong reaction of negative vaidyuta on the sukshma body affecting the sthula. Recurrent Ananda is now fixed in the system. The inspirational ideality has now sunk to the secondary place, a degradation of the revelatory in the intellectual region. Thus another part of the script programme has already been fulfilled. In T 2 the telepathy has become inspirational idealistic in the intuitive mind; there is also a secondary trikaldrishti which reposes upon it and is therefore telepathic in its nature; the intellectual element occurs rarely and is rejected and dismissed. Part only of the script programme has been fulfilled under this head and that too not completely; still it is a decisive conversion and therefore so far the fulfilment is, verbally, complete. In addition a pure inspi- rational trikaldrishti, not telepathic, has begun to operate again. But these inspirations are only just enough illumined for their re- stricted work. They have a narrow discrimination, no revelation. They give only the particular result sometimes with a time element, but no accessories or attendant circumstances except when another inspirational or intuitional indication is added to eke out the first main indication. There is satyam and ritam of a sparse and narrow character, no brihat. Tapatya is being destroyed along with the intellectual element; but there is tapata. All trikaldrishti now contains its own effective tapas, and separate tapas apart from trikaldrishti is rarely em- ployed. It is being eliminated, except to some extent in the action of will on the body. Tapas comes in the trikaldrishti only as if a sort of subordinate accessory, although really in the ideality both are necessary to each other and essentially inherent in each other. But the subordination is kept up in order to get rid of tapata. Once that"},{"pageNumber":1072,"pageContent":"1058 Record of Yoga is removed, the way will be open for an equal unified idea-tapas in the T 2 . Revelation with a stronger discriminatory power is now enter- ing into the pure trikaldrishti, but it acts oftenest by a descent into the intuitive mind. Time, place, circumstance, though now often correct, are still pursued by intellectual error and uncertainty. In the evening and night strong intellectual obstruction which for the most part prevented any definitive progress. Still there was a notable advance in the development of revelatory thought. Vishaya [ ] 5 has only gained so far by insistence (1) a daily but isolated occurrence in swapna, (2) intensity of subtle sparsha in jagrat, antardarshi and bahirdarshi, (3) greater intensity of the type sparshas already in force Rupa is still limited to tendency in the jagrat, to occasional frequency of established movements in swapna. Great intensity of audition and mental vision of the person- alities (devatas) that stand behind the action of the intuitive and intellectual mind and temperament in the sadhana. The truth of the developments thus seen is established by the subsequent result in the changes of the mentality. Script. “What will outline itself, will be 1.

Ideation is still afflicted ordinarily by the necessity of express- ing itself, though ideal in substance, in the intuitive mind. Until this difficulty is overcome, its full conversion cannot take place. Kamananda was oppressed in the latter part of the day yester- day; it is now recurrent rather than continuous. Intense continuous kamananda; action of the nihsmarana sa- haituka and in a less degree of the nihsmarana ahaituka. The Ananda has now only to strive with the forgetfulness in the body which tends to be quite effective only when supported by exclusive absorption in the mind. The Ananda in ambulando is maintained by nistapas smarana and in ahaituka partly by nihsmarana sahaituka, the latter sometimes of a fair intensity. Pervasiveness and an increase of force not yet amounting ordinarily to intensity were brought in successfully, even the fourfold wave movement. Kamananda has attained power of continuity and easy main- tenance by smarana in lighter swapna. In Samadhi strong action of lipi even in the depths and frequent and strong sparsha. Play of rupa; instance of perfect rupa, but unstable. The barrier has not yet been broken down in jagrat rupa. One definite development is the progressive elimination, by force of rejection, of what was once most common, rupa formed painfully out of chaotic material in the akasha. Spontaneity is now the rule; vividness has also begun to predominate; but stability is only initial, except in certain crude forms and even there it is very little more."},{"pageNumber":1074,"pageContent":"1060 Record of Yoga Only some incomplete forms have more stability. Completeness however is not yet perfectly established, though it is common; in- complete forms are frequent. Rapidity and fluidity increase, but are not perfect. Variety is growing strong in the type rupas, but other rupas for the most part come imperfectly and without any devel- oped variety. Group coherence is very occasional. The two main things the will insists on, stability and variety in vivid completeness of the spontaneous developed or perfect figure only come, if at all the first, in the type forms. The main barrier remains erect. In the afternoon much trouble of intellectual suggestion and obstruction, so that no new development came in the subsequent samadhi, except intensity and extension of lipi, speech-thought and ideation. Some mass lipi and reading, but no advance in coherent legibility. The rest was obstructed and occurred, if at all, feebly, and not often in the ideality. The development of ideation was also much baffled and the two lines on which it proceeded rendered for a time doubtful and ineffective by intermixture or intervention of intellectuality. Now, however, the effect has become pronounced; 1 s . t . , conversion of intuition to the revelatory ideation, but with an intuitive burden and a tendency to drop towards mental intuition, 2 dly revelatory inspiration, as demanded in the script programme for T 2 ,witha leaning also, very often, to excess of intuition; 3 d . l . y , though rare, revelatory ideation proper, a little broad and blurred in its light. By the development and liberation from defect of this process will come the complete conversion both of the ideation and of T 2 . Kamananda seems to be strong and fixed in a constant or fre- quent recurrence; it remains to be seen whether the old obstruction will again prevail to impose a long discontinuity or only the present tendency of brief discontinuity by vismriti will limit this siddhi. Chitra rupa and sthapatya rupa are very strong, stronger even than at any previous time, although they have been well founded for several years. Rupa shows a tendency to variety, especially in the crude; but this cannot be entirely relied on as there has again and again been the same tendency, never leading to permanent siddhi;"},{"pageNumber":1075,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1061 it has always been undone, built itself up again, but each time with a diminution rather than a progress. The element of spontaneity however gives this time a greater chance of a final true initiation of progress. Kamananda, though as usual less in the decline of the day, preserved its power of recurrence until sleep. No definite progress in vishaya. There is some tendency of expansion of shabda in the sukshma voice. Primary utthapana fluctuates from return of a certain strong exhaustion in the upholding prana, not the vital, but the physical, and an expulsion of the fatigue tendency, which then clings only by the habit of muscular strain exhausting temporarily the bodys force for motion, but not the upholding prana. For some days the exhaustion has held sway, tonight the elimination was again resumed. May 12. Script gives, (1) T 2 , to be pushed forward, (2) conversion of ideation, to be enlarged and universalised, (3) kamananda, progress decisive, (4) rupa, progress decisive, (5) vishaya, insistence, (6) action of ideality on health and primary utthapana. Add rapid development in things established, lipi, vangmaya, etc. T 2 is now proceeding automatically in the idealisation of the telepathies which are to be converted from the mental to the intu- itive ideal. It is dealing with all telepathies and fixing them decisively in their proper place. Vangmaya is now to be noted in two movements, effulgent and refulgent; (1) effulgent, the pure vangmaya, vak leaping forth from the ideality with the ideation contained in it, (2) expressive of or responding to a previous ideation or else proceeding from a silent indefinite ideation to which it gives form and expression. The former tends to be always revelatory thought and to reject the inferior inspirational and intuitional forms; the latter is ordinar[il]y revelatory in the intuitional form or merely intuitional and can even"},{"pageNumber":1076,"pageContent":"1062 Record of Yoga sink to mental intuitive speech. Ideality is working upon this latter action to assimilate it to the effulgent revelatory speech. Ideation is now usually full of revelatory substance and some- times of revelatory light, but is obstructed in its form of manifesta- tion by the old tendency to expression in the mentality. This is being indulged in order that the resisting intellect may be forced to change entirely into ideal substance of thought. It is the unconverted T 2 which is the main support of this obstruction. The physical obstruction, taking advantage of suspension dur- ing the night, has tried to get rid of the kamananda, to disprove fixity. But the powers of fixity and pervasion have prevailed. They are now natural to the body, can do without tapas and, even when suppressed by the suspension, need only smarana to set them in action. To get rid of suspension by vismriti is now the task that lies before the Ananda. It is now no longer dependent on position, but self-acting in all positions, even in ambulando, where indeed it has a great power of spontaneity and pervasion. Nihsmarana ananda has also become self-acting. Rupa develops variety in the quite crude forms, but the old defect of chaotic non-spontaneous formation with defect of rupa qualities is again strong in them, as in instability and want of variety in the spontaneous forms. These are the two rocks upon which the progress has always fatally stumbled, come to a halt and gone back. Accuracy of intuitive telepathic trikaldrishti is now very strong and embraces detail, though here it is not always quite perfect in its choice. Confusion of stupefied intellect in the physical brain atmosphere is the one successful obstruction now remaining. When this occurs, the ideality has to break its way through to manifest. In samadhi rupa shows a tendency to manifest in antardarshi, some of the forms with an initial, others with a greater stability, but all crude. Developed rupa in swapna once with a strong stabil- ity; chayamaya with a long continuance of chitras or action. The rest reading sometimes very vivid and initially stable ordinarily idealised, but their free action is not yet fixed in the samadhi."},{"pageNumber":1077,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1063 Conversion of ideation into the revelatory-inspirational thought is now enlarging itself very rapidly and being applied to T 2 . Decisive trikaldrishti is frequent, but it is usually telepathic or leans on the telepathic. The greater trikaldrishti awaits the development of the secondary ideality of which there are some precursor signs and instances. T 2 applied to internal movements is advanced, T 2 applied to objects in the field of exercise copious but weak, T 2 applied to life hardly yet in action, except for scattered instances. Rupa developed some variety of fugitive perfect rupas in the evening; they do not emerge perfectly from the chidakasha. The conversion of ideation has been founded, enlarged and developed a strong tendency of universalisation; T 2 has advanced, but is still obstructed. Kamananda has fixed recurrence and an initial power of nihsmarana. Rupa has a certain fixity of its will to progress. Vishaya made no progress. Ideality is acting on arogya and primary utthapana, but without any definite progress. May 13. T 2 is to be rapidly developed today; ideality to continue to universalise its action in the thought and its conversion of thought- speech to the revelatory form and substance; kamananda to develop sasmarana continuity and nihsmarana force, rupa and samadhi to compel their obstacles. Physical siddhi has to generalise its initial progress in its other members. T 2 is busy with the telepathies. It is distinguishing two fields of telepathic knowledge. By identification (sanyama) with the physical plane of being, it feels accurately the tendencies etc that materialise in the object and determine its action; it can even see provisionally the presently future action to a certain extent, provided it does not miss the possibilities that are not yet in action, but may or will be in action. It can see which will prevail, provided no higher idea or will intervenes. Secondly, there are the forces of the lower mental and pranic planes. These it sees before they at all touch the physical; that they are true, it can see by feeling their real- ity and also because they translate themselves subsequently into"},{"pageNumber":1078,"pageContent":"1064 Record of Yoga intention, tendency, action, impulse, impression etc in the object observed. It is here that the danger of perversion by false stress is strongest, though it occurs everywhere, because the pranic especially have a vehement urge towards selffulfilment, the mental a strong intention to fulfil and belief in their success, and they convey this to the observing mind. But only a few can really act upon the object effectively and fulfil their aim. Their action is ir- regular; they often produce a subsequent partial effect or modify the immediate or subsequent action without fulfilling themselves as they had wished, or they fulfil themselves at other times, in another place, under other circumstances, even in other objects. Often the object first influenced escapes, but another which has come into the field of the influence is entirely affected; it is as if the powers acting in him took up and carried out the suggestion which the powers acting in the first had rejected. The powers of the higher mental and pranic planes fulfil themselves much more frequently, powerfully and [ ] 6 they have more of the truth in them. But in all this there is no absolute certainty of future trikaldrishti, though prevision after prevision may be fulfilled with unvarying accuracy for a long time; still it is only even then a prevailing certainty, a mental and moral, not an absolute and ideal certainty. Moreover in all this there is a will attending the idea and the will in the ob- server may help or retard, make possible or prevent the fulfilment; because the powers hostile to a result take note and resist more strongly and if they are stronger, prevail, the powers favourable to it take advantage, strengthen themselves and if the observers will is strong, they prevail. All this is now felt, seen, participated in by the intuitive-inspirational or less easily by the revelatory- inspirational perception in the being. The element of revelation however is now increasingly present in the first or else attends it in the accompanying ideation The perception of all these things is becoming steadily more intense and satisfying, it is increasing in the quality of the satyam brihat and in the ritam of the satyam brihat. The pressure from above is for what is subconscient to be mentally or ideally 6 MS frequently,"},{"pageNumber":1079,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1065 seen and felt, and for the mental perception to be transformed into the ideal or to be accompanied or enlightened by the ideal thought. Kamananda is [increasing] 7 rapidly in sasmarana continuity, but it still tends sometimes and the Ananda tends always to diminu- tion of intensity by vismriti. The opposite tendency of increase by continuity is not yet strong enough to get permanently the upper hand. There is also the habit of discontinuity which though no longer proper to the physical body is imposed on it by the mind of the Akasha of the surrounding [physicality] 8 and accepted through force of past habit. The old sanskara of the body that the Ananda must be discontinued to give it relief, exists also in that mind and has its effect in bringing about discontinuity. The latter can be more easily eliminated than the general habit of discontinuance, which cannot be finally expelled except by the growth of the nihsmarana action. In Samadhi rupa played freely in swapna, occurring automat- ically with spontaneous fluidity, rapidity, vividness, usually with completeness and with much variety every time, the moment the verge of swapna was crossed; but it is still unstable. This play carried itself also into the antardarshi, but there with a certain inability to impress itself on the chittakasha; the rupas however were in their nature of the developed kind. There is still a recurring obstruction to the free play of all the members of the samadhi; the etheric akasha holds them back, is forced, again withholds and has again to be forced. Nevertheless reading manifested and narrative by succession of images. Sasmarana continuity seems now to be sufficiently established, but nihsmarana is still too easily suppressed. The stress has now to be more upon the overcoming of vismriti and its effects. Script. “In kamananda the vismriti to be conquered in these three days, not indeed entirely, but fundamentally....

The ideality to move strongly forward in thought and T 2 .” The vismriti seems already to have been conquered in its effects and it is being now initially conquered in itself, that is, its force is being diminished and at times the Ananda persists against it enforc- ing itself and drawing back the mind to it instead of waiting for the mind to return from its preoccupation and then either reforming or renewing itself. Even when it waits, it does not now need to re- form or renew, but is there all along and is simply felt again by the sense, like the water in which a swimmer is moving. The movement in ideality and T 2 is preparing to set aside its remaining deficiencies. May 14 Script. (1) Kamananda, initial conquest of vismriti. (2) T 2 , emergence of pure trikaldrishti, enlarging of the tapas element (3) Ideality; revelatory thought in the speech; farther con- version in the ideation. (4) Rupa and samadhi proceed with their development. (5) Vishaya to be strongly insisted on so as to break the barrier. The initial conquest of vismriti is growing rapidly and irre- sistibly in strength. The obstruction is now falling back on the fear of the kamananda in the external physicality, its sense that the body will not be able to bear continuous or at least continuously intense kamananda. The only present justification is that the body does not feel quite at home with the grosser, too physical-vital, unidealised form which the ananda still tends too largely to take. Rupa has now broken down two barriers, (1) the inability to proceed with its self-development which arose from a wrong attitude towards the processes actually employed and a haste to get done with imperfect movements; (2) denial of stability in perfection to all but very crude forms."},{"pageNumber":1081,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1067 The development is proceeding steadily against every difficulty; all the old difficulties, presenting themselves as strongly as they can, are being overborne. Secondary initial stability as well as primary has been established in perfect, developed, dense and crude forms alike, but only in the type. Primary initial stability is when the object stands long enough for the eye as well as the mind to get a strong view and impression of it; it is momentary, of one moment. Secondary is when the object stands longer than is needed for this, lingers a moment or two and vanishes; it is a stability of two or three moments. Tertiary is when it stands for several moments. Final stability comes when the object stays as long as the will holds it. The defect of the siddhi, the third barrier still unbroken is its lack of variety. Other forms come, but either they have not even the primary initial stability or, having it, yet they do not come so easily as the type, are not so complete or are in other ways deficient; and in the crude they tend always to be anticipated or replaced by the type. When this barrier breaks down, rupa in the jagrat will be able to develop rapidly its completeness, freedom and perfection. Revelatory thought on the right level and in the inevitable style pure or the inevitable forms of the inspired, illuminative, effective and adequate styles is now well fixed, natural and normal, practi- cally universalised in the original vangmaya. In the derivative it is beginning to triumph finally over the mental gravitation. Vishaya is now reviving in gandha and taste. The position of vishaya is complex and unequal. In gandha it has already been well developed, but it is subject to exceedingly long periods of obstruction and cessation and has then to be redeveloped by tapas. If this habit is overcome and sthula and sukshma gandhas well distinguished, there will be perfect siddhi. Crude primary tastes are similarly established, but here tapas is more easily effective and the distinction is clear; specific tastes occur, but not freely nor in great abundance; of substantial taste there is only an imperfect first movement. Sparsha is violently limited to a few habitual touches which are however well-developed, intensely sthula in their effect, capable of stability; very sukshma effect is more though not quite free, for its variety is limited. Shabda is still more baffled, even"},{"pageNumber":1082,"pageContent":"1068 Record of Yoga where established rare and obstructed and most confused of all by the sthula sounds of the material world. Darshana is only of the pranic akasha and two or three of its objects, and that too imperfectly developed. Another attack from the external physical mind, but this was unable to take the old form of a lethargy of the tapas, relapse into inactive shama and prolonged cessation of the siddhi. It shaped into an upheaval of the lower ideal-intellectual confused-tapasic activity and an attempt to annul temporarily part of the gains of the ideality by a backsliding downwards of the active being. In kamananda it was unable to annul the conquest of the effects of vismriti, but succeeded in giving a fresh lease to the vismriti in itself, which was on the point of disappearing. The difficulties in the ideal conversion, which were disappearing, were also temporarily renewed. On the other hand the ideation gained and especially the perception of the causes, objects and utilities of the opposition movements were immediately seen; there was no disturbance of the samata, except for one or two flying touches. Samadhi limited by the attack. But sthula shabda conversa- tion in the swapna reached a rapid frequency not before realised, ordinarily the dialogue is in sukshma shabda of the nature of thought overheard, though really it is speech. This was speech overheard, but in single sentences or single question and response, not connected dialogue. Ideation has now effected initially its final conversion in the primary ideality. First, the revelatory intuition has begun to fall away and is now only an occasional and attendant lower activity (tertiary) which is on the way to disappearance; then the intuitive- inspirational transformed rapidly into the revelatory-inspirational has given its pride of place to the true revelatory which is taking up all the other forms of ideation. At the same time trikaldrishti first become liberally positive and decisive in the general ideation is now acting with regard to the movements of the objects of vision, not as yet with a perfect arrangement of ritam, but still with a fairly sufficient decisiveness."},{"pageNumber":1083,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1069 In the development of these two movements lies all the future perfection of the primary ideality Rupa is attempting to develop variety and partially succeeding, but it is a variety of imperfect forms. Spontaneous manifestation out of the chidakash is beginning entirely to replace development by mental-physical pressure in the subtle physical ether. In this development lies the surety of a perfect siddhi. May 15 The programme for the second week of May has been fulfilled in all its parts; but in the vishaya it is only a beginning. Lipi is fixed in the ideality and always capable of perfect mani- festation with the eightfold quality; but the resistance of the physical ether remains and force has to be used on it. As this has been little done recently, the resistance has increased, but it only exists initially and can be broken down very rapidly. Ideality has become free and normal in the ideation; the revelatory is the normal type, though the inspirational and intu- itional with the revelatory substance are also still in action. The form of the revelatory ideation is not yet perfect. Speech thought is fixed in the revelatory ideality, but not always in its highest form. T 2 has evolved ideal telepathy and is evolving ideal trikaldrishti and the beginnings of ideal tapas, all in the revelatory form, though the other forms recur. Rupa is attempting to establish variety in the initial stability; the obstacle to this variety is the last of the old barriers. Vishaya is now initially active in all its parts but is still kept within its old limits. Kamananda is fixed in recurrence, but its continuity is still broken in upon by vismriti aided by the demand for discontinuity as a relief to the physical system. The former difficulty is being attacked; the latter is being observed with a view to attack.

Lipi is now laying stress on perfect spontaneity free from the ideal suggestions and a perfect rapid stability. It has founded both of them, the stability being no longer always of the initial order, but also very often a prolonged stability. To this new development only fluidity is lacking. Its complete siddhi will be the final overcoming of the etheric resistance.

A mediate equation has been arrived at, but the full Ananda of the ideal tapas is necessary before the final unification can be secure. It is notable that the Asamata now hardly even ventures to return except in touches of physical uneasiness, caused usually either by physical discomfort, eg, heat, lethargic pressure of tamas on the brain etc, or by psycho-physical discomfort of the attempt of intel- lect to mix still with the ideality or to accompany it.

Something of the latter still exists in the shape of uncertainty, with regard to physical siddhi and life, but it is no longer positive asraddha. In samadhi, even in antardarshi, rupa is becoming more free and spontaneous, but not with sufficient power to hold the akasha so that there is still only an initial stability Script, for the week “Ideation to be fixed in the revelatory thought, the rest being taken up into it. “T 2 to develop trikaldrishti powerfully and begin to strengthen powerfully the ideal tapas. “Rupa to develop variety. “Vishaya to press down the barrier. “Kamananda to vindicate itself against vismriti and disconti- nuity “Samadhi to begin to regularise itself. “The struggle of the ideality with the roga to show its first decisive results of the novel order. “The same in the saundarya and primary utthapana to be prepared.” Kamanandas conquest of vismriti seems to be proceeding by three movements. First, recurrence is being replaced by continuous sasmarana so that when the mind is not absorbed, the Ananda is immediately felt as a thing not recurring, but always present, though for the time being forgotten. This movement has gone very far, though it is not yet absolute. It is the overcoming of natural vismriti. There still remains the artificial vismriti brought about by absorbed concentration of the mind on its thoughts. This is being removed, first, by the mind not being absorbed, by the ideal faculty of a multiple attention, the thought being pursued, yet the Ananda remembered, secondly, by the Ananda becoming so strong as to force itself upon the mind and prevent the total absorption. Both these movements are only as yet initial and have not yet proceeded very far."},{"pageNumber":1086,"pageContent":"1072 Record of Yoga The power of simultaneous attention is now rapidly develop- ing; it is seen that the thought in the ideality can easily be conducted and even more successfully conducted, when the mind is not ab- sorbed, and can ordinarily coexist with the sense of the Ananda, especially the ideation and speech thought (this most, because it is most assured,) but also the T 2 . The gathering together of the mind stuff and the closing of it to other ideas and objects which is the nature of absorption, is no longer necessary for the full force of the thought to reign. The habit still continues, but it is diminishing and has received its death blow. On the other hand when the thought is occupied not only with itself, but with the object of sense or in some action, as in reading, writing, conversing, this gathering and closing is more ready to intervene. Here also, however, there is a strong beginning and already a rapid growth of the elimination. Nihsmarana Ananda is also insisting on regularisation and normality, but chiefly in the sahaituka, because there it is more intense. A flood of action of the intuitive and inspirational lipi, unstable for the most part or with only a primary or secondary stability, pursued by the suggestions, serving only to show the complete ideality of the lipi even at its lowest.

The inferior ideality [is] 9 that which takes up the whole intellectual action and transforms it into vijnana; it is limited by what the in- tuitive intellect might have done; the superior takes up the inferior and is not limited by the possibilities of the intuitive mind. The inferior ideality does in its own right what the intuitive mind does by derivation from the inferior ideality, but the inferior ideality itself is only a selection from the greater range of the superior.

In neither however is the superior ideality directly at work as in the lipi. In the lipi the revelatory ideality is again asserting its predom- inance. The superior ideality has manifested for a moment in the ideation. The complete idealisation of the thought is proceeding rapidly; but it has still to deal with the resistance with regard to exact and decisive T 2 . For where the ideality does not yet act or acts only partially, the intellect has a natural tendency to attempt to fill the place. Once again the ideal tapas has forced the fatigue out of the upholding prana. It now expresses itself in the physical body with a slight shadow thrown upon the prana. May 17.

On the other hand it has withstood a severe test under which formerly it always failed. In addition it successfully maintained its strong and long continuity throughout samadhi, even in sushupti of the mind, the vijnana observing the physical being within the consciousness, not as a form without. Also in samadhi the double concentration was easily and successfully sustained. Ideality has begun to take possession of the samadhi with a sort of crudely regularised action. The idealisation of the mind action seemed to break down for a time by the withdrawal of the vijnana which left the mechanical remnants of the old intellectual action to work by a sort of unwilling pravritti. There is now nothing that demands this action; when it works, it is by a sort of mechanical continuance of a dead habit.

Ideality extends in spite of the intellectual obstacle in T 2 with a more frequent decisiveness in the details of the telepathy.

Vishaya now acts intermittently in all its parts, but still slightly and without enlarging its action.

The recurrence of the intellectual action can in future be no more than a mechanical interlude. What has now to be dissolved is the mixed action of ideality embedded in or hung round with the old mind stuff, half ideality, half intuitive mentality. This inferior action has its stronghold in the T 2 and is dominant in tapas. The stronger action of the superior ideality on a perfect inferior ideality is now the mot dordre of the siddhi. The superior ideality is very visibly busy perfect[ing] the inferior ideality so as to purify it from all immixture of the mental accompaniment. Especially tapas is now getting rapidly idealised and the false mental stress is being at last really eliminated without the force of tapas being diminished. For the difficulty till now was that the force, the rudra shakti, of the tapas always brought with it excitement of mental wish, tapatya or tapata, and overstress, while the elimination of these brought with it also an elimination of the rudra shakti. It is now becoming possible to combine forceful will, even rudra tapas, with truth of ideality. Thought telepathy is beginning to develop. Formerly it was"},{"pageNumber":1089,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1075 only telepathy of the sensations, emotions, desires, impulses etc. Now these are to be combined with telepathic perception and communication of the thoughts. A better distinction of primary and secondary utthapana has now to be made. Primary utthapana properly belongs to the vij- nana, it is the full force of laghima, mahima, anima in the mind stuff and psychic prana so that the mind rejects all exhaustion, weariness, depression of force etc. When this extends to the prana upholding the body, that is primary utthapana in the physical being. Secondary utthapana is elimination of these reactions from the body so that the limbs and the whole body can take and maintain any position or begin and continue any movement for any length of time naturally and in its own right. Tertiary, is when gravitation is conquered. Hitherto the distinction made was between movement ambu- lando and positions of the limbs and the body. These are now being unified in the primary siddhi. Fatigue in the positions is still powerful, but it is physical with a reaction on the upholding prana, brought about by violent pressure on the muscular system. This reaction must be eliminated. The habit of reaction depends on the physical mind. This is shown by the fact that when the body is forgotten, the position is maintained with ease and on the attention coming back to the body it is found that perfect laghima reigns in it. But the attention then brings back the habit of reaction, the physical opposition seizing on the old long-established sanskara to renew its attack. In the vertical triangular position of the arms there is now the pressure relieved by intervals of successful laghima. The element of time abhyasa has to be eliminated. That is to say while formerly the idea was to maintain the position as long as possible and increase the length of time during which the siddhi maintained itself against fatigue, until by this abhyasa it became self-existent, the idea now must be to establish the already self- existent power of the ideality in the body, so that the time makes no difference.

Power of double attention, to thought and to Ananda, is now well-established. What has now to be got rid of, is the interference of the mind-stuff in condensation; this is being already done initially by the interposition making no essential difference, since even then the Ananda reaches the side of cons cious attention, subordinate as yet, which is deputed to receive it. But this siddhi is as yet imperfect and initial. The T 2 is now attempting to extend itself out of the experimen- tal field into the life, in which as yet it was only exercising the old scattered, half-mental action and had secured striking but isolated success and a mass of imperfect results, but no general control. All this movement must develop before the perfection required can be considered accomplished. Script “Samadhi is to carry on the regularisation by the ideality and to enforce freedom and stability in rupa and the other imperfect members. In jagrat rupa a stable variety. In vishaya a breaking down of the barriers. In T 2 life. These are the backward members of the ideality.” In samadhi all its members had play; all are fixed in the ideality or at lowest sink to the intuitive mentality; all have an initial stabil- ity. But reading is still fragmentary and some others occur without any large completeness or without any enlightening context. In internal lipi occurrence of the superior ideality. Samadhi has now two movements, samadhi proper when sit- ting, swapna when lying.

In the latter attempt it has temporarily succeeded. Kamananda is much hampered and though still recurrent af- flicted by diminution and disconti nuity. This defect is no longer due to vismriti or at least no longer has that [as] its base, but only a mechanical habit forced to recur by the massing of the obstruction in the external physicality. The struggle continues in the primary utthapana and the aro- gya. The ideal shakti is more insistent at present in the former than in the latter where the roga successfully obstructs in its two chief strongholds, though in one there are slight signs of its approaching diminution. In a continuity of five hours or so of walking, coming upon the constant abhyasa, more broken, of the past many days, fatigue in the upholding prana was shown to be now merely a shadow, fatigue in the body could only hold if there was relaxation of the utthapana shakti. Even then it was less fatigue than a pressure of the pain of stiffness in the muscles. In relaxation a sort of manomaya laghima without mahima upholds the body, and this force allows the reaction, although it is noticeable that the force of the reaction is diminishing. When the utthapana shakti of mahima-laghima takes possession, and it now ordinarily holds the body, all fatigue and reaction disappear and there is only the pain of stiffness which sometimes decreases and is suppressed, sometimes increases, but does not affect the unrelaxed body. Utthapana of position is still too much afflicted by the pressure on the deficient anima, still too little supported by mahima in the laghima to be prolonged. In Samadhi a great and solid advance. Dream reading (nar- rative and monologue) became perfect, except that it has to be hastily read, the lines disappearing or receding from the direct view as soon as the sense is grasped; but otherwise they are perfectly complete, massed, consecutive, coherent, forming a complete and often a long story or discourse, though occasionally the opening"},{"pageNumber":1092,"pageContent":"1078 Record of Yoga or the close is not read. On the other hand if there is an attempt at stability and deliberate reading, the massed print becomes either instable or incoherent. Dialogue also was perfect, though not so long and complete. In swapna samadhi rupa was perfectly free in the chhayamaya and in the tejomaya with chhayamaya basis. Stability and pro- longed continuity of action some continuity there sometimes is are wanting. Stability only occurs in faint and vague rupas. Vishaya is developing. May 19 Subsequent reaction of stiffness was felt in the morning as pain in the relaxation of the lying posture, but chiefly in the loins where it has not been felt while walking.. On rising everything disappeared or was reduced to a minimum leaving only a suppressed stiffness and fragmentary suggestions of pain. There is at present no trace of bodily fatigue, such as would formerly have been felt, or the vague weight of lassitude which would more recently have been the result. The defect of anima is evidently being conquered, although it still persists and resists ejection. Script. “Today T 2 completing itself. The superior ideality in idea- tion and lipi and speech thought. Restoration of kamananda. Samadhi development. Ideality to take possession of the rupa in the jagrat.

That questioning still continues, but its doubts and its suggestions are disregarded, solved without reference to its diffi- culties and uncertainties. The inferior ideality respected them and leaned upon them. It was to a great extent a referee of the in- tellect, a substitute and an enlightener giving it the knowledge it required and could not itself compass. As a referee it solved its"},{"pageNumber":1093,"pageContent":"20 April–20 May 1918 1079 uncertainties; as a substitute it took up its action but carried it on in the manner of the ideality by revelation, inspiration, intuition, discrimination; as an enlightener it gave it knowledge beyond its scope, but not far beyond its scope. When it went far beyond its scope, it was more often by ideal suggestion than with an absolute authority. The new movement is as yet only initial and still hampered by the continued outer action of the intuitive mind with its clinging ends of intellectual mind-stuff. Lipi. “Superior ideality in trikaldrishti and tapas siddhi”, already beginning to be initially fulfilled. The first and second chatusthayas are now unified by the de- velopment of the traigunyasiddhi. Ananda of shama is combined with ananda of tapas, but tends to be modified and diminished by deficiency of ananda of tapas. This is preparatory to their complete unification. The higher transcendent shakti and the personal shakti are now unified and sraddha swashaktyam is firmly based, but it is still deficient in force and extent. The second chatusthaya is now complete, but in parts it is deficient in force, awaiting farther development of the Kalibhava and this again dependent on farther development of the ideal- ity, that is the unification of the first three chatusthayas. Shama now contains in itself no longer a relaxed, but a concentrated tapas and relaxed prakasha, tapas an involved prakasha and a basic shama. By the unification of the three chatusthayas there will be the perfect unification of the three gunas. This is in the temperament, but the play of jnana and T 2 will bring it about also in the mentality. In the vijnana they are always united. There will then remain the body, but there too the siddhi is being made ready. Ideality II is now acting upon the mental telepathy intuitive and manasic which still survives bringing about a greater light of vision and more efficacy of tapas, but without absolute certainty which only comes when there is the play of the ideal T 2 ; provisional"},{"pageNumber":1094,"pageContent":"1080 Record of Yoga certainty is however more frequent, but does not owing to the continued residuary action of the old intelligence always know its own proper limits. There are now in the lipi three forms of vijnana, (1) the superior ideality (II), (2) the superior ideality in the form of the inferior, (3) the inferior ideality (I) in its three forms, revelatory, inspira- tional and intuitional. The intuitional lipi is now revelatory in its substance even when intuitional in its form, but the inspirational is often inspirational in substance as well as in form. This defect is now being removed and has almost in a moment practically disappeared. Kamananda very much oppressed persists in a diminished and subtilised form, which at its lowest hardly seems kamananda. This is in ambulando, but even at other times there is an oppression which amounts sometimes to sheer and prolonged discontinuity. Advantage is however being taken of this depression to strengthen the element of ideal Ananda. In the evening some restoration of the intensity, but fragmen- tary, recurrent, not continuous. In the morning some depression of utthapana shakti, an over- shadowing by strong effigies of fatigue, once imposing rest. Writing and visits prevented the abhyasa during the rest of the day, except for a short time at night when no trace of fatigue was left, but some muscular stiffness.

There has however been a constant action this morning of ideality in the intuitive mind commenting the confused action of the residuary mind-stuff and distinguishing its element of truth, which is that which sets its waves in motion, and the error which the mind-stuff throws up around the truth and attaches to it. This action is caused by (1) telepathies from outside, (2) telepathies from the mental and pranic planes, (3) obscurely received suggestions from the ideality. When the ideality does not act, the intellect tries to do what it can with all that it receives The obstruction to kamananda continues, though lessened; the ideal Ananda is increasing in its subtle insistence and sometimes takes effect tenuously in the sthula form. There is a movement to apply finally the law of the ideality to the ideation as in the speech thought and the lipi. This is not difficult in the ideation of jnana, but it is still difficult in the ideation of T 2 , especially of tapas. Stress of tapatya and tapata have always been the chief obstacles; whenever removed, they have returned in a modified form; they now return as suggestions from the external physicality breaking down the defences of the intuitive mind. The Shakti has once more put them in their right place and discharged the intuitive mind of tapatya and even of unduly extended tapata.

The sadhan is now concentrated on the vijnana-chatusthaya with an initial stress on the physical siddhi which is still secondary except in the sharira ananda , mainly the kamananda. At present the ideality is passing through a stage of what would formerly have been called relapse, but is now recognised as a rever- sion to a lower movement in order to get rid of still existing defects or possibilities of defect and transform the remnants of the lower into the spirit and the form of the higher movement. Script. “Develop T 2 and ideation, restore kamananda. Persist in rupa and vishaya and samadhi”. 1. Kamananda is restored; it has recovered its power of conti- nuity and its means against vismriti, but is still strongly subject to diminution which manifests chiefly in ambulando. It is clear that the initial conquest of vismriti is firm and real, since it manifests at once after discontinuity and has not to be built up again. The siddhi is subject to diminution and relapse into mechanical discontinuity; it has to overcome these tendencies and to complete its conquest of vismriti, for so long as the latter is only initial and not complete, the relapse to discontinuity must always be possible. 2. T 2 and ideation are working on the physical level of the intellect. They are getting rid of the inspirational and intuitional substance which most lend themselves to the attack of unideal tapas and intellectual error, because their enlightenment is essentially a partial illumination intervening in an initial ignorance. All is being turned to substance of revelatory thought, for it is this that illumines largely and is in its nature a self sight that does not address itself at all to the initial ignorance of the intellect. Even in T 2 the conversion to revelatory thought is being rapidly led towards completeness. 3. Rupa has been baffled in its development of stable variety."},{"pageNumber":1098,"pageContent":"1084 Record of Yoga Variety has been partially developed in power, but subject to all the old difficulties. In the crude the tyranny of the type form which obstructs and excludes the others, obstructs their spontaneous man- ifestation and allows only a difficult development pursued and overcome by the type form which, even when they emerge, returns upon them and usurps their place. In the developed and dense other forms occur, but are imperfect, unstable and confined to a few persistent forms or kinds of form. The principle of barring a free variety by insistence on already common rupas is still the chief and hitherto a successful weapon of the obstruction. 4. Vishaya is simply unable to overcome the barrier. In samadhi, antardarshi and swapna, in the vangmaya the inspirational and intuitional forms have been entirely taken up into the revelatory form, so that both form and substance are now of this highest element of the inferior ideality. Moreover this inferior ideality is full of the spirit and presence of the superior ritam. The same movement has to be effected in the waking thought-speech and in the ideation and it has in fact begun, but here owing to the greater diffusion of the mind it is more difficult. The revelatory thought has in a way taken up all the other forms, but their effects still remain as a limiting element which prevents and conditions the play of the knowledge. Especially it is now acting on the level of the intellect and its revelations are on that level pursued by the uncertainties of the intellect, by its tapas or ineffectual straining after certainty and effectivity, by its smallness of periphery in the conscious being and scope of knowledge and power. The object seems to be to meet these difficulties in their own field and even there to establish the fullness of revelatory light and substance and the free certainties of the superior ideality. Here the script programme has been initially fulfilled. But in the rupa it has not been justified. Rupa has only become capable of variety; it has not accomplished it. Vishaya has only effected an uncertain and scanty initial play, an action of subtle sparsha just verging on the sthula, a dim fragmentary beginning of ̧ cravana.

In samadhi taste and smell are still crude and faint.

Primary utthapana after a brilliant beginning has relapsed into ineffectivity and subjection to physical fatigue. Arogya is limited to an incomplete and struggling inhibition of the fragments of roga, but these only occur by persistent exposure to the action of their habitual causes, and to a preparation for the conquest of the two or three fixed rogas; the actual conquest is still far from effectuation. In saundarya no advance except the stronger fixture of the sukshma bhava of youth and ananda and a certain light and prophecy of it in the eyes and face. Kamananda is still afflicted by diminution and discontinuity; the conquest of vismriti is still only initial. May 22. This is the fourth week of May, the month of decisive prepa- ration of finality and perfection in the vijnana chatusthaya. It is proposed to effect the perfection of the primary ideality in ideation and speech thought and as far as possible in T 2 . Rupa, vishaya, samadhi, the three defective members, have to insist on their initial completeness in the ideality. The preparation of the sharira sid- dhi has to insist also against the powerful obstruction of the old imperfect physicality which defends its habits as the law of the being. The satyam brihat of the tapas, the physical telepathy and the telepathy of the mental and pranic planes is being established in the idealised intelligence under the guidance of the ideality; the object is to eliminate in its own field the false stress, the intellectual decision, so that the ideal ritam may be freed from the pursuit of the intellect. In samadhi ideality took more firmly hold of rupa. There was"},{"pageNumber":1100,"pageContent":"1086 Record of Yoga also the beginning of the specific religious ideality and the ideal sense of prayer and adoration as an element of love and oneness with the Divine. This is being extended and transformed into the finality of the personal relation of the Jiva with the Iswara In samadhi at night obstruction, with prevalent incoherence. It was only by force of tapas that t he play of the siddhi was brought about, and the free play could not be secured. May 23. For some days there has been a strong revival of the obstruc- tion to the whole siddhi, but specially the ideality. The object is to enforce the old rule of a recurring period of relapse, enduring usually for a fortnight more or less, or even longer, and the method is to enforce a sort of lethargy of unresponsiveness in the mind and physicality by which first, if possible, all action shall be obstructed, secondly, whatever action is enforced by tapas shall be imperfect and marred by the old asiddhi, thirdly, as a result things which seemed to have been eliminated shall be revived, thus discouraging the faith and the tapas. The first object has not been gained, because in spite of periods of cessation, the tapas has insisted and the action of the ideality has been enforced even in this adverse condition, but the other two objects have been partially and temporarily gained. The action of the ideality is no longer free, but dependent on tapas and a struggle with the lethargic obstruction, the revived action of the intellect has vitiated the perfection of the ideality and even touches of imperfection have come in the first two chatusthayas. Nevertheless the siddhi advances and no longer behind the veil, as formerly in periods of relapse, but openly, though with apparent concessions to asiddhi used for strengthening the siddhi. The prin- ciple of subconscient progress has been eliminated, but the principle of finesse still continues. The main progress this morning is the enforcement, 1, of the constant habitual action of the ideality, in spite of the physical brains lethargy, 2, of the constant combined action of ideation, speech thought and T 2 to which is being added the lipi. These"},{"pageNumber":1101,"pageContent":"21 May–1 July 1918 1087 used to give place to each other and act alternately. There is also a movement to add the action of rupa and vishaya and kamananda but the power of multiple tapas is not yet strong enough to effect the perfect combination. This enforcement of the combined action of ideation, T 2 and speech thought of the ideal kind is being more and more insisted on and is on the point of becoming spontaneous and normal. The main defect lies now in the downward gravitation which prevents the thought from being of the highest elevation possible, the stuff of intellect mixed in the ideation and vak by the persistence of a background of intellectual demand and pursuit of the thought by a vague intellectual observation and judgment, which though not often explicit hampers the ideality, and the continuance of external intellectual suggestion in T 2 . Nevertheless the change from ideal intervention to a massed ideal movement of all the activities of the consciousness, progresses with considerable rapidity. In Samadhi unprecedent[ed]ly large play of coherent reading of great length; but incoherence also persists side by side with it. The other members also had coherent play but less prominently. The insistence on Kamananda is less, the continuity is sus- pended, but recurrence remains. May 24. T 2 advances steadily. Tapas (telepathic) is becoming normally effective and more clearsighted and therefore more accurate. Strong tapas which was hitherto discouraged, because it brought the tap- atya, is now being encouraged and the remnants of tapatya are being transformed into forcible prolongation of right tapas. Ac- cordingly the brihat satyam of T 2 is becoming as complete as it can be without perfect ritam and without the play of the superior ideality. For that combination alone can give all the right data in their right place including tendencies which are latent or obscurely implied and eventualities of which there is no present sign.

Strong and successful secondary utthapana of position. It is remarkable that fatigue of the physical mind and will, or rather the mind and will of the body, was not at all in question; for from the first it was as if already eliminated, except for a few ineffective attempts at return. Only at the end it came in in support of the muscular reaction. Primary utthapana was therefore estab- lished except in so far as it failed, through failure of secondary utthapana. The secondary was tried in the morning in the arms, in two hor- izontal positions A Ia & b, frontal triangular and frontal straight. In Ia siddhi came easily; the attempt to enforce [an]anima, though recurrent, failed in persistence and in violence; self-existent uttha- pana, free from defect of anima, was established and remained. In Ib there was violent opposition, but it failed in the right arm, but succeeded in the left by persistence of pain of ananima aided afterwards by pressure of downward garima from above, not gravitation, but pressure of some other external force which comes in when gravitation weakens. Gravitation is attraction from below, this is a mass of pressure from above. In the right arm self existent utthapana was established. In the left it became strong enough to maintain the position in spite of pressure and pain and even to make the pain recurrent instead of persistent and to discourage and sometimes lighten the pressure, but not to get rid of it. The whole lasted 2 1 – 2 continuous hours. In the result force of selfexistent utthapana is established in the arms as was shown in the afternoon, but ananima still remains to limit and resist the siddhi, though with greatly diminished force. In the afternoon two positions of the legs, B.I & II, lying on the back, crooked position, lower parts horizontal, and lying on each side, alternately, horizontal II.a (straight) & II.b crooked.

On the whole on the left the utthapana was well maintained, either self-existent or satapas, for about 15 minutes; on the right there was after 7 or 8 minutes the overpowering by defect of anima. Therefore this utthapana of B positions can only be regarded as preparatory, as it was declared to be before it began. In arms AA, (ie lying on back), the old self-existent utthapana force recovered strength and maintained itself, after one or two downward tendencies of lapse, even in sleep. Throughout the increased power and effectivity of tapas was very marked. In Samadhi free action of rupa and frequent initial stability and continuity. Incoherence has invaded the lipi in the deeper swapna. May 25. The dealings of the ideality with the revived intellect element, show an increasing subtlety and fullness of the vijnana, giving a clear ideal interpretation of the obscure brain-suggestions, which if carried to the extreme will mean a full satyam brihat with a sufficient ritam. But the process means a continual indulgence of the obscuration by the intellect which involves a suspension of the direct and primary action of the ideality. Behind the obscuration the superior ideality is growing in power upon the whole thought action. The increase of the ritam in the satyam brihat of the telepathies on the lowest level has been proceeding rapidly, but complete ritam is not yet established. Lipi is being left entirely to itself to establish the eightfold quality in perfectly spontaneous lipi without aid of the tapas or the suggestions.

In samadhi lipi recovered its coherency in deep swapna samadhi, but there is an intermediate stage between dream and samadhi, the one passing over into the other, in which incoherence is still common. Nevertheless the incoherence can be pieced together: sometimes it arises from fragments of a sentence or thought being put together without the connecting words or thoughts, and then they have to be filled in, sometimes from the coalition of thoughts which are not connected and then they have to be separated.

The upshot of the last month is to have founded firmly the ideality in the inferior or primary form, it is true, but with a sub- stance of superior, that is to say, secondary ideality, and to have applied it to the whole range of thought including T 2 . In the latter, however, it is still weak and has comparatively little scope. The lower intellectuality is on the point of abolition but the intuitive has still its role and must keep it till the superior ideality has got into its own characteristic form and occupied the place now held by the primary ideality. Samadhi has grown greatly in strength, especially in the last few days. Rupa in swapna is very strong, various and rich and stability up to the tertiary initial is common; but the prolonged stability is only in the shadowy forms. Reading has become free and current, but not always coherent, or even when coherent, not cohesive; the sentences are sufficient to themselves and have not, except exceptionally, a visible relation to each other. Rupa is pressing forward in antardarshi, but has not yet fixed its hold on the bahirdarshi. Vishaya is still unable to break down the barrier. As a result of the work done in the last few days which was accomplished in the complete control (dasya), the passivity of the intellect has been greatly intensified and a new action is coming into being from above which evidently belongs to the secondary ideality. This is the beginning of the tertiary dasya. June 3 Secondary utthapana II.a.b. left side for more than half an hour, variation for five minutes to IIb(a), slanting upwards.

For the whole first fortnight of June the active sadhana has been suspended; there has been the absorbing preoccupation of another activity. At first the play of the ideality was associated with it, but it is now abated and is turning again to the sadhana.

Here too mahima laghima is in possession, but the defect of utthapana shakti is greater, due to the survival of the defect of anima shown by a reaction in the muscles after cessation, which was absent from the asanas of the early morning. The asana could not have been continued longer without some strain and difficulty. No evident reaction from the walking in this position. The movement is now to replace finally in trikaldrishti the action through the intellect by the action through the intuitive mind. In trikaldrishti the survival of the inferior action is strong and will take some time to eliminate. It prevents decisive trikaldrishti and perpetuates error of stress and error of interpretation of the will-messages and knowledge-messages from the ideality. Kamananda has gone back for the time being. Smarana is no longer always sufficient to recall it. Arogya also is thrown back in chronic rogas 1 and 2; but in the latter only under great stress lasting for the whole fortnight and here the siddhi tendency is evident even in failure.

Today the condition of a general low tone of the being with yet a continued progress in the Yoga still continues; no depression, but a ghost of languor in the body which obstructs the channel action of the mind. The vijnana acts, but irregularly, not with a rapid or normal flow. It has not yet recovered its brightness, but is a clouded sunlight. According to the lipi there should be today some blaze of the gnosis. Now it is suggested to the mind that trikaldrishti-tapas which yesterday founded itself in this halflight is to develop farther, telepathy be farther taken up, ideal samadhi increase its hold and the physical siddhi enlarge its foundation. Some progress may also be expected with the more constant darshana of the Ananda Ishwara.

Even the trikaldrishti is pragmatic, not the highest entirely certain seeing, but gives only a practical certainty. Tapas is assuming the same kind of intuitivity. All tendencies and forces are admitted which offer themselves to the sight and now are seen in juster proportions than at any previous time. But the light is the clouded sunlight, not the full blaze of golden or fiery day. There is the blaze of the highest logistic ideality in the lipi and the thought speech, but it has not yet gained the perceptive thought, much less the T 3 . But as soon as this was written, that transforming movement too began. As always, it is the subjective trikaldrishti that is the first to advance; the objective is hampered by the physical obstruction. The golden but not the fiery blaze is gain- ing the lesser movements, including the remnants of the mechanical intuivity. Kavya for a while worked in the revelation, but was soon clouded by the obscurity of the intellectual effort. Arogya is steadily gaining in force, but with a slow pressure. The fragmentary rogas encircle dully in the subtle pranic atmo- sphere and touch or menace, but only hold now and then in certain residuary recurrences. The intestinal complaint is constantly reach- ing the vanishing point and then resuming hold, but there is nothing like the past violent returns. The restitution in the centre is only just trying to get and maintain an initial foothold; nothing evidently decisive. Samadhi completed its idealisation in the afternoon; but at night it is subject to the relapse of sleep. In the afternoon there is only at most a shadow.

Wednesday 25 th June. 1919 The ideality of all speech thought has long been assured; the ideality of the perceptive thought is now becoming assured, wide, universal. Only the tapas and the trikaldrishtic thought and per- ception remains to be similarly illumined; this has begun, but its progress is interrupted and obstructed. There is a speech thought of the nature of vani expressing the trikaldrishti which is still of the intellectual ideality or intuitivity and subject to error, but that comes only in the inertia of the mechanical mentality. This mechanical passivity has to be got rid of, all has to become an ideal ̧ camamaya activity. Passivity of the mind has now served its purpose, the mind has become a silent channel; only the obstruction of the physical brain atmosphere preserves the dull habit of this passivity, a tamasic persistence in an inert misrepresentation of the old ̧ canti . The only progress in the physical siddhi is a commencement of the idealising of the Ananda. Today the insistence on K.A. [Kama Ananda] is renewed; but the forgetfulness of the body continues. The intuitivity is strong in the K.A, only initial in the other anandas. The Ananda Ishwara is now vivid and all the action and guna has been taken up into the Anandamaya; there was a discord be- tween the darshan of the supreme universal Anandamaya and the perception of the universal mental unideal consciousness, but this is cured and only the bridge between the Anandamaya in universal and individual and the mentality is not yet brought into light. If this is done the darshana will be complete in essence. Kamananda is again being pushed forward; the difficulties still are mechanical discontinuity, forgetfulness, mechanical diminu- tion, the need of tapas to restore it when smarana is not suffi- cient, absorption, sleep. The mechanical discontinuity only prevails (1) when the energy is at a low ebb, (2) after long forgetfulness.

Absorption now for the same reason does not necessarily bring discontinuity. Two movements are being carried on, (1) removal of exclusive absorp- tion, the simultaneity of a double memory or concentration, (2) the inability of absorption to bring about complete discontinuity. These siddhis formerly only hinted at or momentarily accomplished, are now beginning to establish themselves, however imperfectly. Old occupations which excluded memory of K A are now admitting it, eg reading, writing, bathing, eating. There are two absorptions, the luminous concentration and the tamasic “absence” of the part of the mind not occupied in the particular work; the latter is the only real difficulty; it is not really an absence, but an involution in tamas, a sort of cloud of inertia, which is physically sensible all about the brain or near it. Telepathic thought in its lowest mental form is being idealised on these levels. K.A maintained throughout the day, even during absorbed writing and in conversation when it is apt to cease, but not without interruptions of forgetfulness. The body is not yet in secure pos- session of it, owing to a constant pressure for exclusion from the opposing forces. Finesse was again used in the vijnana-siddhi in the evening; the whole mass of the old basic intellectuality was re-presented and the mind plunged into it, the ideality mostly held back, so that there might be a wider transformation, thought to be idealised even when occurring on the very lowest levels, even below the brain, even the thought of the chitta and the prana and the subconscious mind.

Once begun it can continue for a time of its own motion, but for its initiation and long maintenance has to depend on smarana and needs often a will in the smarana, sometimes a forceful tapas against the obstacle. Spontaneous initiation, renewal and maintenance [have] 1 been begun and at favourable times are not infrequent, but are not yet the law of the body. The struggle between sleep and continuity of the Ananda has begun, but the continuity still needs the aid of smarana and tapas and does not subsist in the deeper nidra. Samadhi has relapsed to a certain extent, is much assailed by sleep and incoherence. Its advance which was always laborious, has again become fragmentary. There is some progress in stability and vivid force of drishya, but it is again mostly chhayamaya. Ex- treme shadowy drishya has sometimes almost a complete stability; it then lasts long with some moments of eclipse. Combination of thought-speech, perceptive thought and lipi has begun, but with some difficulty. Ideality has been strongly attacked throughout the day, but progresses even in a general lowering, especially in telepathy and trikaldrishti. Ideality of thought is being generalised on all levels and intellectual thought is now becoming more and more the recur- rence of an abnormality. The generalisation of telepathic ideality has begun on a large scale. Decisive trikaldrishti is being enforced and enlarged against great difficulty. The first two chatusthayas grow continually stronger and show this increasing strength in each fresh attack. They can only be attacked at all, and then very ineffectively, when the ideality is lowered or suspended.

June 1919 The dasya is now being perfected and made vivid; first, the dasya of the worker and instrument is made complete and perfect. To that is added the dasya of the power, dasi iswari; the difficulty was the insufficiency of the aishwarya and consequently of the sense of the Ishwari, but now the relative and progressive aishwarya is for the time being accepted. The dasya to the Guru is also added and is uniting with these forms. The dasya in the relations of friend (raised to brother, bandhu), vatsalya, father etc are being prepared for perfection and unity in the madhura. All has to be taken up into the madhura. This movement can only be perfect when the sense of the presence of the Ishwara is allowed to be nitya in its directness and vividness. At present the Ishwara still acts from behind the Shakti. Attack of roga on digestive functions suppressed by tapas after a struggle with a residue in bhava. This is only part of the gen- eral attack of vague recurrence and attempted restoration (fever, headache, cold etc); it materialises in the digestive functioning, be- cause that is still immediately capable of brief sthula recurrence. The others are only potentially capable, except for fragmentary touches. This fragmentary recurrence has been attacked and is in process of slow diminution, but is not yet got rid of. The two constant rogas, as well as the imperfect process of evacuation still continue. Telepathy has been purified in regard to the tendencies and forces immediately affecting the adharas in action; that is to say, the insistence of a perceived tendency, force or intention on its fulfilment, the choice of one to be favoured and fulfilled without reference to the real ideality and the claim of telepathy or present trikaldrishti to figure as future drishti, of tendency, force, intention, possibility and probability to masquerade as certain result, is being eliminated from T 3 .

This will complete the present trikaldrishti, except for the right perception of the states of unseen objects which is still backward. This movement is setting free the future trikaldrishti; certitudes are already increasing, but are still for the most telepathic certitudes, that is based on present fact, and extending to primary immediate or near result, which is growing strong, to secondary farther off or intermediate results, which is growing, and final results, which is still only in initiation or else not linked in to the rest in a suffi- cient ideal unity. Beyond this trikaldrishtic telepathy lies the pure trikaldrishti independent of all perception of tendencies, forces, in- tentions. Time and detail have still to develop certitude. It is notable that there has not been in the past nor is there now any attempt, except for fragmentary illuminations, to develop trikaldrishti of the past. This is partly due to the nature of the adhara in which the mind has always been concentrated on the present and the future, and subjected to a deficient memory from which past events have quickly faded. In part it is due to the mentality of the age which has taken in the adhara an extreme form, except that this individual mind goes back readily to a far past in which the future was prefigured. Pain and discomfort are being strongly taken up by the Ananda. Today all pain and discomfort, the former even very acute and of some little persistence, the latter massive and oppressive, were permeated with Ananda.

But these three things and especially the last are not only mechanical, but abnormal, the results of a strong hostile pressure from outside which takes advantage of the mechanical memory of old habit in the body. Sleep and absorption are now the only real difficulties, both have begun to yield to the siddhi. The ideality is now busy with the trikaldrishti, taking up and fighting all the old confusions. When done on the higher level, this process proceeds harmoniously with little flaw or mistake; on the lower level it is a slower progress of order in the midst of a chaos. All telepathies are now justified but at the moment the old intellectual intervention of false stress continually returns in a less or a greater degree. This difficulty is chiefly felt with regard to rapidly changing action. Other defects of the ideality are also being taken up for cor- rection Samadhi in the afternoon was overpowered by a persistent unnaturally deep sleep, but the samadhi power, though it could not persevere, broke to a certain extent into the nidra. There are now frequent lapses into the idealised mentality and from there into the tamas of the physical obstruction. The Ananda perseveres, but does not increase, forgetfulness still besieges. The other siddhis are obstructed and some of the physical subject to a certain limited relapse. The defect of the traigunya siddhi is that tapasic stress on the one hand, inertia of mental shama with tamas breaking across it and sometimes possessing cling to the mind by a sort of external affecting adhesion. This is being remedied first by an increasing externalisation of the inferior tapas, next by the increasing prakasha of the shamas.

In samadhi coherence gained ground in the lipi. There was a whole passage written successively with perfect coherence of thought and word, in spite of one or two attempts of the besieging incoherence. Incoherence remains especially when the lipi written or printed comes in large masses, but it is evidently a receding, though still persistent force. This is in a middlingly deep nidra; the deepest nidra is yet to be invaded and taken into possession by samadhi.

This is followed by an attempt to throw in scattering currents of duhkha as through subtle nerve currents. The whole disturbance comes from an illegitimate attempt from outside to bring the action of the chandramandala to replace the surya action. The blaze of the surya action is now taking possession, forcing aside the minor soma action. The attack of the asamata falls away from the surya blaze; it subsists only by a reflex of the ineffective chandra action which is easily attackable by the old deficiencies. The blaze brings also the light of the trikaldrishti. A crisis has also been brought about in the Ananda, which failed in the interval, there has also been a strong attack of fatigue tamas. The Ananda disability is being pushed aside by the surya action, the fatigue combated by surya tapas. Samadhi in its lighter forms is acclimatising the blaze of the Surya. In the waking state the highest ideality is still combated by the minds persistence in the intuitive chandra mould and in the lower forms of the intellectualised surya ideality, but it is making the other movements its own. The difficulty is with the T 3 . In the K.A. the intuitive substance of Ananda is more in- tense and tries to subsist as against the slighter substance of the suryamaya; but the latter is persisting and taking possession.

Ananda darshana is also assuming the Surya form and the Surya Ananda. K.A too is now more readily running in the Surya mould; the Chandra intensity is being rapidly extruded.

The Surya action limited by the sunlit intellectual intuitivity and the remnants of the Chandra intuitivity continues its gradual process of assumption. The blaze of the ideality has spread itself and can now hold all the thought and thought-speech and the telepathies, but is still impeded in T 2 by the incertitudes of the mentality. In the telepathies it is a modified and quiet light, but in the rest a fuller stronger blaze with flashes of Agni and Vidyut; the latter suggest the supreme vidyunmaya Ananda chandra. The Surya power is now also acting as tapas on the obstacles to the Arogya and the utthapana, but these are strong and persistent in their pressure. The Samadhi is still being taken up by the Surya power only in antardarshi jagrat and the lighter depths. Deep nidra is still only invaded on its borders and gives at best coherent dream with a touch of misplaced ideality. The ideality in the afternoon has been extending itself with a certain slow deliberateness. It is taking up telepathic trikaldrishti of time, place and circumstance, things neglected or else unsuc- cessfully attempted by the former sadhana; this is because the mental telepathic indications abound around every isolated cer- titude and bring in a besieging error and incertitude.

Tuesday July 1 s . t . 1919 The month of June has been a period of the overcoming of difficulties in the central ideality, in the Ananda Ishwara Dar- shana and in the Kama Ananda, a combat with difficulties and slow varying progress in some elements of ̧ Carira siddhi. The first two chatusthayas have enormously increased in breadth, power and finality, though not yet absolutely secure against superficial fragmentary and momentary disturbance. Brahma chatusthaya has enlarged in base and scope and taken on the supreme Ishwara, Purusha form. It has only to be thoroughly confirmed and filled in with the jnana, etc by the gnosis. The difficulty is almost eliminated in all the central ideality except the T 3 . There it is being removed and has to be eliminated partially or wholly during the month of July. Perfection prepared by the last months work has to be initially founded in the highest logistic ideality. In Samadhi and rupa vishaya the obstacles have to be still overcome; in the former they have a diminished, in the latter a complete persistence. The difficulties of Ananda have to be obliterated and spontaneity, continuity and intensity fixed in the system. The difficulties of the arogya have to be attacked and brought to nothing; this is possibl e in July, but not yet certain. The utthapana and saundarya are likely to be longer hampered and are not likely to come to anything very considerable till the closing months of the year.

This night owing partly to previous tapas the attack was neither so successful nor so forcible. Eye disease is now operating in the sukshma showing there its symptoms and trying to impress them on the physical body by the sraddha in the disease; it is combated by tapas and by sraddha in arogya and is not so far successful except very superficial[ly], and this slight superficial result is now more easily removed by tapas as soon as the body rises. It is now quite evident that the source of disease is psychical, not physical; it is due to failure of tapas, idea of ill-health, weakness of the prana-shakti, faith in ill-health in the physical body. Faith with knowledge from the ideality is now powerful to combat it, though not yet entirely to eliminate; for the body is still subject to the mental suggestions from the outside forces. The rupa is commencing again; some crude rupas, some im- ages of things immediately or habitually seen, some of things not habitually seen; but all are momentary and unstable except the crude rupas. There is a tendency also to resume the old abandoned rupas, ghana, etc. It is intimated that this time there will be a real recommencement and steady progress. In spite of strong dullness of physical tamas ideality advances; a flood of ideal telepathy is taking up even the subconscious indica- tions.

There are certain first indications of future siddhi, not yet able to persist in formation, but amounting to decisive hints of a preparation behind in the over-idea. Wednesday July 2 1919. A certain lapse towards intellectuality, intended to show the extent of the persistence of intellect in the ideal action and by a clearer distinctness base a firmer action of the T 3 . The defect of the intellectual mixture lies mainly in an undue stress on active possibilities which brings in a continual error and incertitude. The possibilities have to be seen around the decisive certitude. The thought of the T 2 , other than that of the sadhana and inner ac- tion, is growing in ideality and certitude, but is yet lacking in perfection. A still more decided and well-justified certitude is beginning. Rupa is rapidly redeveloping various forms of ghana, devel- oped and perfect as well as the different materials, notably colour, as also combined rupas and groups, but all this is only in the old initial form. The fugitiveness is modifying towards [a] 3 yet ill- decided initial or momentary stability. The method of development has yet to be changed to the ideality. In Samadhi, first an initial variety of complete and initially stable crude rupas in antardarshi (long-withheld and appearing to be condemned to infruition), in swapna brilliant momentary tejomaya figures and scenes in a first attempt at abundance, the movement cut short by nidra.

Tapas is now trying to come up to trikaldrishti. At first strain of tapas ordinarily fulfilling itself against fluctuations, but afterwards the fluctuations or opposite forces often prevailed, definitely or for a time, but all tapas is now being put in its place, as has already been done with trikaldrishti. Tapas decisively indicative of ideal certitude has begun, but has to be normalised. The difference is that trikaldrishti comes as the seeing idea carrying [in it] 4 fulfilling tapas, ideal tapas as the seeing force with the sight subordinate indicating its certitude of effectuation. No advance in the evening or night; roga (throat) attacked suddenly and held for a while but was lessened almost immediately and dismissed after a while though with slight after effects, much exaggerated in appearance, but with little material solidity. They were at once and easily dismissed in the morning. Thursday July 3. 1919 The T 3 on the level of the old telepathies is now turning fi- nally to T 2 , telepathy enlightened by the ideality taking the form of present trikaldrishti. This is imperfect still, because elements of old telepathy are still imported into it, but these are being steadily eliminated and exist mainly in stress of telepathic tapas which is lessening rapidly. When the light of the ideality is withdrawn, T 3 returns, but that too is being immediately seized on and converted into an indirect gnosis. Tapas is resigning its strain of effort to- wards self-effectuation; it has for a long time been lessened, is now greatly diminished and is nearing the line of disappearance. Active trikaldrishti of future is still niggardly in spite of occasional freer movements, as distinguished from general sadhana prevision; it is this which still gives room to some persistence of modified tapasic stresses. Knowledge and will are becoming more and more an ex- pression of being, rather than detached observer and actor on being. 4 MS it in"},{"pageNumber":1124,"pageContent":"1110 Record of Yoga The removal of the remaining stress of tapas is now the key; but this cannot be done without a normalised self-effective ideal tapas; at present it exists only in type, usually of a mixed and imperfect kind. Tapas used by itself still tends to bring back confusion. Samadhi at first ineffective owing to nidra. Afterwards strong organisation of the various action of gnosis in the lighter samadhi; also in deeper swapna with a gnostic waking control, jagrat in swapna, even in a considerable depth. Lax swapna without waking control is also being idealised, dream interpreted, analysed, turned into vision and thought of samadhi. This interpretation is done partly in antardarshi, partly in swapna. Only deep tamasic nidra still resists in some entirety, but that too has a pursuing touch of vijnana and is sometimes invaded by some gnosis. Tapas is putting aside more effectively strain of effort for self- effectuation, though it is not entirely cleared away out of the whole action; but at times it is pure. Tapastya, tapatya, tapata continue, in their absence, the tapas is still inert and not directly effective, but they act without strain, only as degrees of impersonal insis- tence: they are all to be replaced by tapana, the fire of surya in the will-powers. This is done in telepathic tapas. Trikaldrishtic tapas occurs more frequently, but is still rare. There is already a tendency for trikaldrishti and tapas, knowledge and will, to combine more closely and become one. In the central roga there is some increase of the tendency of siddhi, more effective insistence of tightness mending the subsidiary looseness of the centre which is the immediate cause of all the roga. Looseness now comes less often without cause as a mechanical habit, more often with pressure of causes; but the causes of loose- ness are beginning to become causes of health and force. These changes are still not quite firm at the root and tend to fluctuate; there is a mixed action. In cold etc health in the daytime holds sway; attacks are lessened in force and persistence, but touch once or twice in sleep or recumbence by physical laxity. Utthapana is weak and afflicted. K.

Tapas is farther getting rid of the relics of stress, both understress and overstress, trikaldrishti striving towards a greater general and detailed certitude.

Sunday 6 th July 1919 In the early morning incoherent dream turned suddenly into dream symbol recurring and progressing even after intermediate wakings. Ideality of a loose kind in the nidra. Trikaldrishti, tapas, telepathy are now combining definitely into one movement which is beginning to rise above the constant uneven balancings of the two opposite perceptions, that of the powers and tendencies of the present and what they mean and presage, and that of the other powers and forces which attempt to create a future not bound by the probabilities of the present. In the intuitive mind the first corresponds to the current habit- ual understanding in the intellectual reason, the second to the pragmatic reason and will, a third range of perceptions to the truth- seeking reason. In the gnosis the lowest or primary logistic gnosis, of the nature of the intuition of the immediate, is strongest in the light of the present and proceeds from that to the other truths, it is more fitted for present telepathy than for future trikaldrishti. The secondary logistic gnosis of the nature of inspiration, is a sort of creative or forecasting light and gives best the tapas of the future, the will at work now and hereafter for effectuation. The tertiary logistic gnosis of the nature of revelation lifts up both these powers, gives them its own light and fuses perfectly the two elements of perception. It is here that the real trikaldrishti becomes facile. It is to this revelatory light that the T 3 is trying to rise so as to become entirely T 2 . But it would also seem that the full"},{"pageNumber":1126,"pageContent":"1112 Record of Yoga power of trikaldrishti belongs to a higher vijnana than the logistic gnosis. Tertiary dasya is now becoming very intense in its power; there is little questioning as to what should or should not be thought, done or spoken, but only the force compelling the thought, act or speech and its acceptance by the yantra. This is strongest in action, weakest in speech, because speech has always been for a long time past spoken mostly without reflection or thought from the speech centre and not the thought centre, the latter only cooperating some- times or in a vague fashion, but only recently has there been some beginning of the idealised speech. In samadhi much and increasing activity of rupa. In antar- darshi, in which as in jagrat rupa has long been violently obstructed and almost suppressed, there is now a stirring. But samadhi is now a little inactive. Monday July 7. 1919 Indications of fresh initiations of progress in the morning. The dasya is now rapidly growing in intensity; perfect tertiary dasya of thought is coming with the growth of the highest logistic ideality. Primary dasya has long since been taken up [ ] 5 into the secondary, the Jiva into the Jiva-Prakriti (primary dasya is when the jiva acts consciously in obedience to the prakriti as the executrix of the Ishwara or to the Ishwara acting through the varying forces of the prakriti or those which she guides or drives as an imperative force). The secondary dasya in which the Prakriti uses the instrument and itself obeys the Ishwara, but guided as if from behind a veil and more immediately using her own forces for the satisfaction of his ganas, the devatas, is now coming to a close; it is being taken up into the tertiary dasya. This is now an action of the gnostic devatas in the Prakriti with the sense of the Ishwara immediately behind them; but the Ishwara also begins again to be directly manifest in the guidance and the Person. This is growing; meanwhile the Prakriti is unifying with the Purusha and the Ishwara directly or through the Deva-shaktis driving the instrument with an absolute 5 MS or"},{"pageNumber":1127,"pageContent":"24 June–14 July 1919 1113 and immediately and intensely felt decisiveness of control as if it were being pushed by him with his hand upon it and it vibrated with the ananda of the touch and the driving. This is in thought and still more vividly in action. Some shadow of the old dasyas persist in a subordinate sensation. The highest ideality is now acting in jnana frequently with a complete possession; only, when the thought tapas is relaxed or there is some other preoccupation, the older state of mixed intuitive mind and lower gnosis holds predominance. Very little remnant of intellectuality is left in existence; only some after effect of it is left in the lowest action of the intuitive perception. Little samadhi; activity of clear crude rupa in antardarshi Kama Ananda is now acting easily enough, but forgetfulness of other preoccupation is still strong in actuality; it has not been immediately abolished. In a sense however the Ananda may be said to be always there in an active or suppressed condition. The process of filling in the T 2 with the light of the highest logistic ideality has now begun to move forward again with ra- pidity, the general thought being already totally enlightened. All this is still in the secondary ideality suffused with the light of the tertiary gnosis. Certitude in trikaldrishti is now being enforced; the telepathies that give the wrong stresses are being enlightened in those stresses, they are being turned into the truth of idea-forces of being, each with its own provisional certitude. This is one part of the process of transmutation. The other is to fix the right proportions, no longer in the intuitivity as was done before, but in the light of the true ideality and increasingly of the highest logistic gnosis, and to multiply the perceptions of the idea force which is destined to immediate or subsequent effectuation. A general idea of the time is growing. Place and circumstance as yet are only hinted or seen but with incertitude in the intuitive mind. This process already applied to prevision in the sadhana is now being applied to seen objects and their movements in the immediate vicinity. Distant sight is still in the imperfect telepathic condition, as also telepathy of thought (very fragmentary) and mental movements, the latter often vivid, abun- dant and accurate. Perception of the physical forces and sadhana is still subject to great incertitudes, as also that of distant eventuality."},{"pageNumber":1128,"pageContent":"1114 Record of Yoga K.A is now in a way settled in the body, thus fulfilling the suggestion about the 7 th ; but the intensities vary and there is not perfect continuity when the mind is turned away entirely from the body.

At night rupa in samadhi accompanied by shabda, sparsha and shabda speech. Shabda speech also in antardarshi.

This is in spite of the lowering of the system and a dull inactive siege of the substance of in- tuitive mentality (on which the gnosis is acting to transform it) by the environing intellectual forces. These produce no intellectual thought, but only semi-intellectualised motions of the intuitive men- tal stuff, with certain dull memories of the asamata. The capacity of the system to respond when vehemently forced to touches of asamata suggestion is therefore not destroyed, nor can be till the physical mentality is idealised without any remnant of intellectual suggestion. Predicted in the script today, “This afternoon a great advance in samadhi.. Today, a great advance in K.A... The highest ideality to be in full possession, though in the lower form.” This at the time seemed improbable, but has been not only accurately but fully executed. This shows a great advance in the suggestive script, which used formerly to be only partially fulfilled, the opposition at once proceeding with success to frustrate it, or else only fulfilled later at another time and under other circumstances Samadhi, in deep nidra, was entirely of the ideality, where not drowned in tamas, though of a dream ideality, more than the gnosis of actuality. In lighter sleep there was no nidra or dream, but pure samadhi, dream being replaced by definite, coherent and intelligible vision of other worlds etc; all was besides of the highest ideality, which took entire possession of antardarshi and lighter swapna. These results may be considered as fixed; for however they may be attacked, they can no longer be thrown back towards asiddhi.

There remains the absorption with objects and work or action. This also is being removed, but the obstacle is stronger here; it brings momentary forgetfulness. These siddhis have long been insisted on and acquired in the type by the tapas, but they have been repeatedly lost and failed to achieve universality and finality. This time the siddhi is stronger; it remains to be seen whether it is final against absorption in pressure of work or strong concentration on objects. The fluctuation of intensity is here an obstacle, as the lesser intensity is unfavourable to the conquest of absorption. It is suggested that this also will be accomplished today, but will have to be confirmed in the following two or three days. The obstacle to the memory is the clouding of a certain sub- stance of mentality which gets into the way of the rest of the consciousness: the ideality can concentrate completely on thought the power of thought and yet have plenty of power of attention for other simultaneous experience; this is the principle of multiple concentration in a general embracing infinite consciousness, the divine vijnana. Initially in a very restricted type this is beginning.

Sahaituka kamananda, long discontinued, is beginning, but at first only in touches though these are increasing in frequency. They result from any touch on the body; there is frequently a mixture of it in the tivra. This rule is now suddenly established fully in the type, every strongly sensible touch is bringing the K.A with or without other anandas, tivra, vishaya, raudra, vaidyuta. The prediction of the Ananda is likely to be fulfilled in all the range of the five anandas. Raudra is now universalised; all touches of pain with rare exceptions bring in ananda, either at once or in the second instant after the touch. Vaidyuta is also beginning to resume and enlarge its operation. But it has still to be idealised as well as the three other Anandas. K.A itself is not yet idealised in perfection. In Samadhi all is either highest ideality or dream ideality; but images of actuality are now commencing and all is turning towards the real reality. The pressure of the highest ideality increases with a constant though still obstructed rapidity. The samadhi was today much besieged by nidra. At night nidra prevailed and there was no progress. K.A continued its insistence. Even in the prolonged writing it maintained itself in spite of pressure of obstruction, but there was a continual recurrence of forgetfulness due to excessive absorption. At night there was something of a collapse; tamas took hold of the system. Rupa in jagrat today threw out some new brilliant forms, but did not seem to fulfil the presage in the script; vishaya, after enforcing itself in gandha and rasa and a slight renewal of sparsha, failed to develop sravana or a decisive beginning in sparsha.

This morning there is the return of the besieging intellectualised intuitive mentality. K A is persistent, but uncertain in its incidence. These two siddhis are advancing under difficulties; the thought is besieged by uncertainty and the intellectual confusion. There is a movement towards trikaldrishti of circumstance, but though the circumstances seen are actual and true, they are not seen in their right order and incidence, owing to the intuivity which takes possession of them before their logistic revelation The interruptions of K.A are being reduced to momentary for- getfulness; the mind is almost immediately recalled to the Ananda. This is gaining in spite of massings of the tamasic stuff of men- tal oblivion. There is even often a simultaneous forgetfulness and oblivion, part of the mind absorbed, part of it conscious of the Ananda. It is intimated in the script that whatever forgetfulness or interruptions there may be the K A will in these three days fix its irrevocable continuity. Ananda usually pervades constantly the lower part of the body, less constantly the arms, intermittently the upper body, very rarely the head. There is now insistence on complete pervasion. Sahaituka is increasing its frequency and inci- dence. Ananda in the head is now constantly recurring and making for continuity, but there is a tendency for it to shift from one part to the other alternately; it has to be fixed in a complete pervasion. No definite progress in Samadhi, only continuance. The K.A fluctuates, owing to the lapse of the being towards the intuitive mentality. In that mentality there is the absorption of the mind in the thought because it has to listen and attend, the limited concentration, the forgetfulness of other things. The gnosis illumines easily without need of this strenuous concentration; it is capable of a multiple concentration. When the ideality is at work and the system full of the ideality, then the K.A proceeds without any but momentary lapses into oblivion. Chitra in some abundance, but unstable.

Saturday July 12. Imperfect recovery of vijnana. There is a varying between intuitive mentality, intuitive and inspired ideality and the highest ideality with much of the old mixture. Attack of roga, violent in the subtle body. There is an intense struggle between roga and physical health, the latter supported by the tendency to arogya. The occasion is the exposure to damp cold air at night; the old bodily tendency wishes to reply at once with fever, cold, cough, etc, the health force wants to get back to the state after Alipur yoga when the body was impervious to illness and get rid of the subsequent morbid sensibility. The ideal arogya itself is a different thing which yet waits to take direct possession of the body. In Samadhi relapse to unidealised nidra with difficulty held up to occasional highest ideality The system is returning to the ideality. Highest inspired ideality and a little of highest revelatory gnosis with an intuitional basis is taking possession of the lipi. Inspired highest gnosis is also taking possession of the thought-speech and initially of the perceptions; in the latter it is the highest intuition packed with inspiration. In T 2 the mixed movements are being rejected and pure highest ideality insisted on though with some difficulty; yet with a steady progres- sion. K.A is also reviving its force which has been low owing to the depressed state of the physical shakti. Chitra and fragmentary vishaya but no definite progress. Roga has been strong in the subtle sharira (feverish symptoms), but little manifestation in the body except depression and a sensation of weakness combated by the pranic tapas.

T 2 is still in the same condition but has begun to be taken up a little. To get rid of the remnants of mental effort and allow the vijnana to act with an entire freedom on the passive system is now the condition of rapid progress. K.A has recovered, but is still subject to forgetfulness of ab- sorption. The pervasiveness is now in a way established from head to foot, but the intensity is still liable to frequent loss or depression or diminution and the insufficient intensity brings with it the other imperfections. The body is still liable to the sense of lassitude and weakness. Immediately afterwards K.A recovered all its intensity. When this is present forgetfulness can only be momentary, except in case of very strong absorption in which case the intensity still tends to fade. In Samadhi there is again the full force of the ideality in spite of some heavy nidra; but as yet no definite forward progress, only a preparation. The dream ideality is still strong, not replaced by the actuality. The kamananda invaded the deeper samadhi and even the nidra, but with a frequent recurrence, not in continuity. It is however attacked then by the degradatory change to a negative form; intense but of the impure anandamaya, (negative electrical reaction.) Intensity of the ideality seems to be established in spite of some tendency to relapse; the old thin ananda is being excluded from the system. The precise trikaldrishti is again being taken up; the decisive trik. now manifests in the intuitive form through an obstructing veil of mentality; it is correct when it is not modified by the men- tal stuff; modified it gives the general fact accurately but not the circumstance. The pure intuitive mental trik. is often accurately correct up to a certain point, but often errs in some details of the circumstance, but always in arrangement, not in fact of tendency or actual potentiality: the intellectualised intuitivity of the mind is always a confusion, but this now only occurs when there is mental tapas and insistence on the siddhi.

The system lowered to the intuitive mentality; in that mentality the habitual mind set to work and all its excesses and stresses set finally right, then this habitual mechanical intuivity rejected for the pragmatic intuitivity. This finality was effected by every suggestion being at once stripped of certainty; it fell then to its right proportion; the habit of insisting because many suggestions proved correct, was finally killed; whatever recurs will now be an involuntary habit of response with no vitality in it, a suggestion from outside unable to command credit. The pragmatic intuivity is being similarly dealt with and replaced by the real intuivity. As yet the highest intuivity has not been separately handled for finality. The next difficulty is the insistence of a mental intuivity responding to the gnosis or rather catching at it before it is formed on its own plane. This is possible because that was always the real nature of mental thought and the whole mentality is not yet possessed by the gnosis. This action is henceforth mainly that of the highest or truth reflecting intuivity which has taken into itself the abandoned mechanical and pragmatic action. The truth reflecting intuitivity is now put into its proper place. It has to be replaced entirely in T 2 by the ideality: but in this operation there are still considerable difficulties. The chief is the persistence in the stuff of the intu- itive mentality of the habit of catching at the gnostic light instead of allowing it to manifest in its own way, on its own level and illumine the mentality. The other difficulties are incidental and secondary, but considerable. They all arise from old habits and limitations. In samadhi at first pressure of nidra. Afterwards complete ideality.

Practically all the siddhis are ready or almost ready for advance except the two most difficult parts of the Sharira and the outward Karma. After a little difficulty the transformation of T 2 to the ideality has begun finally. The action of the intuitive mentality continues, but accompanying it there is an ideal action which gives sometimes a decisive, sometimes a limited and therefore relative certitude, sometimes in conjunction with the lower movement a mixed de- cisive and relative certainty or a mixed incertitude and certitude.

There is a strong attempt to restore asamata attended by a great violence of suggestion of raga and dwesha; it is not supported by the Purusha or the personal Prakriti, but has been able to produce asamata in the outward physical mentality. These things are still possible because of the persistence of intuitive mentality in the stuff of the physical consciousness; that can only be secure against mental suggestions by a partial personal siddhi cut off from the external Nature or by complete idealisation.

The ideality has resumed its work; it is taking up into the mixed intuitional form of ideality, mixed by the presence of mind- stuff with its limiting suggestions, the truth-reflecting intuitivity and itself is being taken up by the hi ghest logistis. The inspirational intuivity suggested by the external mind remains as an obstacle, but is, when it comes, attacked and half transformed by the gnosis. Its power is in all those things that have not yet in the Abhyasa been assumed by the highest logistic gnosis The obstacle now is the sluggishness of the old mentality unlifted by the inspired intuitivity which mixes with and keeps down the gnosis. This is the old a ction of the mixed intuitional ideality then strong and luminous, now unconvincing and void of force. Only the highest gnosis can continue the sadhana. The depressed lowness of the system has given occasion for another and furious attack of the environing intellectual powers, with a forced physically mental asamata in outworks of the system, vibrations not belonging to the system, but imposed from outside, also asraddha not in the Ishwara, but in the siddhi of the ideality.

The system is now almost settled in the intuitional ideality, though occasionally the old intuitive be- ing breaks in or surges out from suppression and takes temporary possession. This is whenever the gnosis has been for some time inactive. The siege of Roga continues, but chiefly in the subtle phys- icality: the effects on the dense body are occasional, sometimes strong, but thrown out by the tapas after a short struggle. Only in the two still chronic ailments is there as yet a permanently suc- cessful obstruction; but in the centrality the effective pressure of Arogya-tapas increases with a sort of slow, but always perceptible steadiness. Chitra is showing some tendency to greater stability, but as yet only in the indirect vision. The fugitive forms have more firmness in their incidence. There is no improvement in the character of the forms or the range of the rupa. After some dark nidra strong ideal action in the Samadhi.

The rupas however were no longer chhayamaya of the underworld, but tejomaya of the pranic world, with great but an unearthly vividness, beauty and force of life. Massed rupas of the same character appeared in light samadhi on the borders of an- tardarshi, but with a less heavy fullness and not actual, but rupas of possible things, and not stable, but also not entirely fugitive. Thought, judgment, interpretation maintained a coherent ideality even in the depths of nidra. A much greater character of normality in the whole samadhi. Vishaya (physical) in jagrat antardarshi attained in touch to a great plenty; all the subtle results, suggestions, sensations of spar- sha, except the actual sthula incidence. This too occurred freely, but only in habitual rupas. It is noticeable however that nothing came which had not previously been gained in past years by sadhana, only they came with a greater force, frequency and intensity. In swapna there is now more frequent and forceful sparsha. Sravana is ob- structed both in antardarshi and full jagrat; it is rare even in swapna. An attempt at a higher Thought confined to the centre of the thought above the head and a withdrawal of that which forms in the brain region of the subtle mind or is occupied with penetration to this region. This was the normal gravitation because here the thought assumed a satisfaction of present living actuality, while above it had a higher, but remoter less physically satisfying quality.

Subsequently the inspired thought began to take the place of the intuitional gnosis and take up into it the T 2 . Much more might have been done on the intuitional basis, but this would have been a lesser siddhi and was not the intention of the will of the Ishwara, which is already giving presages of the ascent beyond logistic to the second stair of gnosis, when once the supreme logistis shall have been formulated in its relative entirety."},{"pageNumber":1145,"pageContent":"15–26 July 1919 1131 Health stronger again in resistance to cold exposure.

It is only at a high pitch that tapas and trikaldrishti join in an assured ideal equality or oneness.

The mental tamas masses of oblivion, while writing etc are also being attacked, dissipated, set aside or illumined by light of ideality. The work, it is said, will be confirmed today (thought) and completed in three days (lipi). The difference of Ananda in the postures is still marked. Sitting it is capable of a great initial intensity and force of conti- nuity; today greater and more exciting to the whole system than before. Reclining, it is capable of a great intensity, but often im- pure of the unidealised kind, especially when there is samadhi and nidra. Walking it is intense with difficulty, more liable to decided interruption or reduction to a minimum. Standing it is still less intense except at moments, especially if there is other occupation. These defects are now being attacked. Insistent in- tensity has been introduced into the standing attitude, recurrent when reading; it is being insisted on in the walking. In reclining the ananda is being purified and idealised: it is being enforced in Samadhi. Samadhi, late in the morning. Ideal lipi, scene etc. As the rupa becomes pranic instead of chhayamaya, visions of things never seen nor suggested by the seen arrive. Today, an eagle carrying a lamb to its nest and there beginning to devour it, half dead; nest, eagle, lamb very vivid, but pranamaya, as in a living picture of the Indian type, not quite the earthly bhava of the forms, nor the earthly lines, in spite of the bodily type and species being the same. This heralds the liberation of the rupa. Ananda in samadhi constant in lighter depths, spontaneously recurrent in deeper swapna, but interrupted by nidra in the deepest swapna. The ananda tends to draw the mind back to the body, but then there occurs often a phenomenon which is now growing, the double or triple samadhi, in which the outside world is experienced accurately in an outer consciousness of sleep, by the sukshma and not the sthula indriya. The inner consciousness remains in swapna, a deeper is in sushupti of some kind, for the most part swapnamaya sushupti. Sometimes the outer world is experienced by the subtle sense with a fringe of waking physical sense. At times there is a division of the consciousness between the outer physical and the inner dream mind, the latter withdrawn into swapna and sleep, the"},{"pageNumber":1148,"pageContent":"1134 Record of Yoga former still aware physically on the outskirts of outer sound, touch or experience. The replacement of the idealised, intuitional intellectuality by the inspired intuitional or intuitional inspired for the telepathy is proceeding very rapidly, but is not yet absolutely complete. Mean- while the higher trikaldrishti acts only by intervention in the mass of rapid and crowding ideal telepat hies. Now the process of including the inspired intuition has begun and is proceeding with a great initial rapidity. The higher level of the thought and T 2 is now (in the afternoon) beginning suddenly to rise to the revelatory inspired and inspired revelatory logistis. This is necessary in order that the inspired and intuitional inspired may take entirely the place of the intuitional thinking as the lower level of the thought process. This lower level represents the substitute for the former intellectually intuitive thought and uncertain telepathic perception, the thought of the pos- sibility. The higher level rises towards the certitudes and more and more, as it rises in the scale, commands them in its light and power Drishya of the panchabhuta, mass and karma, the pranic ether and some of its elementary incidents, wind, rain etc is now recom- mencing. This brings in three of the long suspended vishayas. The other vishayas are coming forward, but with no widening range. Sravana is the most difficult, because the physical ear is beset by physical sounds in the daytime and cannot easily distinguish the slighter subtle sonances. Sadhara rupa also is returning, fine crude, often perfect, but without stability. This has brought in an outburst of the finer prakashamaya niradhara rupas in a variety, groups, persons, ob- jects, animals, scenes, some clear, others confused, none stable, except a solitary one or two: but there is already a hint of a tendency towards stability. Of the three gunas, variety, perfection, stability, the first long resisted may possibly now be on the point of bursting the barrier. It is to be noted that lipi in the morning declared that today would be the turning point in jagrat rupa and vishaya; this lipi has been repeated with a firmer asseveration. This may be the beginning in the rupa; but as yet there is no appearance of fulfilment in the vishaya. All the material crude forms have now manifested in"},{"pageNumber":1149,"pageContent":"15–26 July 1919 1135 this finer crude niradhara, prakasha, chhaya, tejas, jyotir, agni and varnamaya forms. Subsequently some union of stability and relative perfection began to be developed in a still greater but confused and irregular variety. The higher forms occurred hardly at all and then without stability. In Samadhi much pressure of Nidra, but the ideal samadhi persevered and kept itself in progress as an overtone. Rupas of the manasa loka, bright and tejomaya, but with a brief stability. Dream was immediately converted into symbol of ideality; incoherence of lipi into a crookedness of pointed significance. In the lapse of the tapas the intuitional ideal mind reappeared for a while, but always with the inspired gnosis hovering over it to take it up and transform it into its own character. As yet the mornings hint of rapidity is not fulfilled, it was so understood at the time that there might be some delay. The inspiration holds the field. K.A also lost for a time its continuity and intensity. It is now recovering, but at this time between 12 and 3 it tends to some deidealisation and conversion into perverse negative electricity and has to be restored on the resumption of the normal activity. This has been done today with rapidity. The conversion has begun of T 2 into the revelatory logistic ideality. At first this is attended with some intuitive revelatory action incased in the old intellectual doubt, but this is to be changed into the inspired logistic revelation. The certitude is already immensely increased, but it is not till all is changed to the terms of this drishti that there can be an initial perfection of accuracy in the T 2 .The drishti reveals the decisive truth of each movement, whether it be a possibility of self-effecting force or a relative, temporary or decisive finality of effectuation. This is the last movement within the ideal logistis.

The element of revelatory judgment does not with sufficient prominence accompany the rev- elatory seeing of tapas or intention of action. Nevertheless, when left to itself this intuitive revelation can judge and fix accurately enough possibility and finality, even though it is not so forcible and conclusive as the inspired or the full revelation. This is with regard to succession of circumstance. This logistis acts as yet only partly in judgment of time, very uncertainly in relation to space and direction; but sometimes it takes them up all three and combines them with sufficient or complete fullness of accuracy. All this is in the field of exercise. Teledrishti is not yet being exercised in this higher action. The lipi is still logistic, but a higher than the logistic ideality is entering into it attended by a diviner splendour of light and blaze of fiery effulgence. This may be called the hermetic gnosis. Its essence is ̧cruti or divine inspiration, as the essence of logistis is smriti, divine mnemosyne. One remembers at a second remove the knowledge secret in the being but lost by the mind in the oblivion of the ignorance, the other divines at a first remove a greater power of that knowledge. One resembles the reason, is a divine reason, the other is [of] the nature of prophesis or inspired interpretation. Sparsha is now abundant in the three things formerly gained by the sadhana, touch of subtle water and fire, touch of light things, eg insects, thread, wind, both of these strong, vivid, materialised, effective on the physical body, and other touches not materialised, but having a certain physical result of sensation; subtle in intent, sthula in result, but not with the full density. Some of these sparshas are however on the verge of materialisation. All this action was formerly regarded as an inferior insufficiency by the intellectual impatience, but is now accepted as a stage towards the full sparsha. The old drishya of the pranic ether is also resuming its plenty. The ̧ cravana seems to be awaiting the silence of the night for its manifestation; but the sthula hearing is becoming exceedingly acute and comprehensive and there is a hint of sukshma sound behind its abundance.

The higher hermetic gnosis is now showing itself in the rev- elatory logistis not only in the lipi, but in thought-speech and perception; something of it is evident in trikaldrishti and Tapas, even when these act through the idealised intuivity; this action no longer disturbs to any great extent by a premature anticipation of the future actuality or possibility and falsification of the present ac- tuality. That was formerly the result of a higher power suggesting its greater possibilities to the lower plane. The purification of the lower plane makes it a clearer channel and prevents this consequence.

Some slight recurrent residue of tendency remains, but not enough to trouble the system. There is a great increase of tapas supremacy in the dealing with roga.

This is now being corrected, but it is noticeable that the obstruction is being concentrated in the physical system. Opposi- tion in the objective subjectivity is half-hearted; the opposition has lost faith and self-confidence. The remnants of the habit of intellectual judgment and re- cipiency are now being raised and extruded from the system; the ideality is to be its own recipient, its own critic, questioner, judge, authority. Samadhi in the later part of the morning. Perfect freedom of rupa, variety, perfection, vividness, but only in initial or primary stability in the pranic world. Chhaya only comes in usually as a shade on some of the pranic rupas; most are free from chhaya. Incoherence in the lipi is at once turned to coherence or proved to be a coherence. Antardarshi rupa is being prepared in the light swapna, on the borders of the two states and in some cases in antardarshi itself there are scenes and figures of a pranic kind, not crude, but ghana. Rasa is now frequent in masses, sometimes persistent; ob- struction hardly exists for its action. Gandha gains in force, but is prevented by the obstruction from frequency. The incidence of the relapse into the intuitive intellectuality has been very obstinate and severe, a great confusion created, almost all the old incidents of relapse suggested, even something like the old hardly idealised intellectual intuivity revived in fragments and in the mental atmosphere. The orderly and powerful development of the gnosis has undergone momentarily a strong interruption. Nevertheless lipi after some fluctuations has greatly increased in force of revelatory light and the breadth of its flood and luminous force; thought speech has also grown in inspired revelatory power.

At present all perception is of the intuitive ideal level with a touch or pressure of revelation tending to rise into the intuitive or inspired revelatory logistis, attended often by cloggings of intuitive matter or deviating into some kind of imperfect inspiration. The intuitive mentality itself has been so strongly idealised in its struggle with the gnosis that it is difficult sometimes to distinguish between this heavily idealised intuivity and the real intuitive or inspirational gnosis at its lower levels of force, light or certitude. Dream at night of an extraordinary coherence, free for the most part from present association, except in the later nidra, and almost on the point of conversion to ideal experience of past, future or otherwhere happenings. In samadhi some incoherence and a lower level of general force of the ideality, but no cessation of abundance. This incoherence tends to turn into a more prolonged and sustained perfection of dialogue, narrative, lipi etc. K.A afflicted, but not discontinued in its recurrence. Some attempt at enlargement of drishya and vishaya generally, as of rupa, but very uncertain and infirm though tending to largeness. Persistence of attack of roga and replying tapas. Generally an embarrassed but still successful progress, preparing a greater siddhi. July 23 d Wednesday A day of partial recovery and advance. T 2 is acting with a quieter, deliberately limited and restrained action. Correct in the intuivity of the gnosis, although embarrassed by a strong adhesion of stuff of uncertain mental intuivity, the inspi- rational form is still overpowered by the latter disability, gives only the tendencies, pressures of force, suggestions of coming possibility. Intuitive certitude is slowly but steadily enlarging its operation. K.A after some difficulty has recovered its basic continuity, but thinly without the opulent incidence and pervasion. Steady in act, variable in incidence, but afflicted by oblivion of absorption, only the thought not going out to objects, interferes less with it than the concentration on act or object, but this too now causes oblivion when attention is required to the thought-process. At the same time there is a progressive force of recovery."},{"pageNumber":1156,"pageContent":"1142 Record of Yoga Premananda in the Vishwadarshana has for some days been insisting on its normality. Ahaituka mental darshana is the chief obstacle; it is shantimaya with suppressed prema or anandamaya with diminished prema. This mental sight is disappearing before the premamaya vision into the vijnana or chidghana saguna seeing. In proportion as the guna was not seen, there was deficiency of prema; in the prema itself the mentality would thrust a diminish- ing incompletive suggestion of sterile ahaituka. Vijnana darshana does not suppress, but can hold a non-insistent diminished prema. Prema increases the ananda in the vijnana; ananda increases prema. Brahma-vision seeing things as objects of the unifying cognizance tends to be without prema; Purusha Brahma or Ishwara brahma darshana brings the deeper unity, prema and ananda. K.A has recovered its force, but is still easily depressed by the interruption of the minds absorptions, because there is a pressure on it from the obstructing force which compels it to sink easily in a mechanical variation of intensity, fluctuation and occasional cessation of its overt presence. But now the memory always brings back the Ananda. In Samadhi continuous narrative, monologue, dialogue or their combination in the ideal form. This was done largely and for long in lighter swapna, on its borders or partly in concentrated antardarshi and partly in swapna. There is no long continuity of it in the deeper swapna which is still a thing of many, swift and brief experiences, thoughts and visions. K. Ananda maintained in lighter swapna, brought in with difficulty at a greater depth, non-existent in deep nidra. Exceedingly strong and violent varied gandha. Rasa is recurrent, but not with such persistent freedom as yesterday, but it is developing more distinct rasas. Throughout the day there has been a strong persistence of the relics of the intuitive mentality and the intuitive ideality has not been effective in getting rid of the obsession; because it is no longer the chosen instrumentation.

The siddhi is now moving towards a system of complete af- firmation; all thought and percep tion, no matter what the source or medium, is admitted as having some kind of justification in force and being and the exact nature of the justification is be- ing immediately assigned and made as precise as possible. In this process intuitive mental thought is allowed, but idealised in the mentality, since so only can it get its proper proportions. This has always been the theory of the sadhana; it has been preparing and repeatedly insisted on for a long time, but only now by this re- moval of the too trenchant intellectual distinction between satyam and asatyam is it becoming entirely possible. This completion is necessary for the manifestation of the hermetic gnosis; the logistic is a limiting gnosis, the hermetic an entirely comprehensive ideal- ity. T 2 cannot be perfect, but only relatively perfect in the logistic gnosis. Gandha and rasa are now acting with a considerable free- dom and variety and the former with a fundamental perfection.

This movement represents a complete mutation of the whole being into the gnostic type. Even the physi- cal being is beginning this mutation. Forecast in the samadhi, this change is also beginning in the jagrat condition. Sparsha has now a greater freedom and variety of the more subtle touches. Half-sthula sukshma sparsha also comes more of- ten and with greater force, but not without some difficulty and obstruction. The K.A violently oppressed; but the mechanical discontinuity cannot maintain itself any longer when there is smarana, except for a while after long discontinuity by oblivion. There is only strong suppression of intensity reaching the verge of discontinuity. The intensity recurs whenever there is laxity of the oppression. The movement is now to the complete idealisation of the whole being. But the system is still low and the intuitive mentality recurs persistently and has to be idealised into the full logistis. This is espe- cially due to the recurrent imperfection of T 2 and to the continuance of old states in the physical being. Friday. July 25. Yesterdays recovery was not complete except for a temporary movement. The new siddhi is still invaded by the external intu- itivity, though there is no complete relapse. The ideality moves on the level of a thickly illumined revelatory intuition. This is extending greatly a relatively certain trikaldrishti and taking up firmly some, rejecting others of the telepathic suggestions which are again coming from the intuitive externality. The siddhi of T 2 is only initial; much has to be done before it can acquire a settled universality. K.A at first distressed to the extreme point near discontinuity.

Tapas is increasing its Kali force and largeness of action. There is now a struggle between two kinds of ideality, the old ideality which depends upon the existent actuality, illumines it, goes a little beyond it but from it, returns to it, acquiesces temporarily in its decisions, and a new greater pragmatic ideality which takes the present actuality as a passing [circumstance], 7 claims to go alto- gether beyond it, to create with a certain large freedom according to the Will and looks even beyond to the omnipotence of the Self and its will, [to] determine as well as see the future.

The complete fulfilment of the programme for July has been prevented by the sudden relapse towards the intuitive mentality. T 2 has indeed developed an initial firmness, but this is very insuf- ficient in universality owing to the mental interference. The two first chatusthayas have again been contradicted by the invasion of the external mentality, which brings in an element of asraddha, tamas, dissatisfaction, and some broken hints of the revolt of the mental will and its old duhkha at asatya and asiddhi , the only two things that can still produce a perturbation. These touches are combated and thrown out by the tapas of samata, but they cre- ate recurrent vibrations though they cannot occupy the mentality. K A has confirmed only a recurrent, not an unbroken continuity, a continuity in smarana broken by brief mechanical discontinuities, but not a conquest of absorption and sleep; the other Anandas have therefore also to await their greater development. Karma is developing, but on a limited scale. Kali has deepened and pos- sesses the system, but Krishna is still veiled by the ganas and devatas. Ananda Brahman has filled in with the chidghana and prema, but not yet with the fullness of the Anandamaya Ishwara.

Tapas siddhi to increase immediately to its full force in the pragmatic ideality. Health to continue the battle, but to give the increase of the tapas against the existing difficulties. The delight of the Ananda to fix itself against the oblivion of absorption, not yet against the sleep. Ananda Ishwara to determine itself in the darshana. Light of the hermetic ideality to suffuse the high- est ideality. Samadhi to determine its ideality in the permanent fixity. Vishaya to develop as also the rupa siddhi. These things and others to begin in the remaining days of July. Siddhi began with the Ananda-Brahman. This is now be- ginning finally to impose itself on both the chidghana and the mental darshana. In the latter it either diffuses itself or contains the mental seeing, but in both cases is itself mentalised and loses its character of the pure perfect unmodified Ananda. The vijnana darshana either contains or is contained in the Ananda. In the former case the Ananda is either made of the chidghana kind or surrounds it in its mental or its chidghana modification. Prema is always present in the Ananda darshana, but is often seen as an element of the thing, rasa-grahana , without evoking bhoga of prema in the chitta and prana. It is seen by prakamya, not received by vyapti. The vijnana darshana is now being made by tapas to replace more firmly and fully the mental seeing. The more perfect Ananda darshana then supervenes more easily and with a greater completeness, density and amplitude. The struggle with the remnants of the relapse continued for a time. Strong pragmatic ideal tapas worked in and on the resistance, till the intuitive ideality in intuitive manasa and vijnana replaced the lax intuitive mentality. Then suddenly in Samadhi complete and powerful gnostic revelation took up the whole action in light and deeper swapna, brought in full coherence, excluded all mentality: but in the deepest nidra imperfection still continued though at- tacked and partially excluded by the revelatory gnosis. There was no actual dream, but insufficient inner jagrat[t]a. In the waking state also this gnosis took up the thought, but not so completely; T 2 is still a gate for the intervention of manasa ."},{"pageNumber":1163,"pageContent":"27 July–13 August 1919 1149 Nevertheless the gnosis is working upon this manasa to transform it and exclude all unconverted movements. There is also some initial movement of turning the K A into the character of this gnosis. Samadhi in the afternoon overpowered by nidra, only towards the end returning to the gnostic drishti. In the ideality a strong and stable perception of the mental panchabhuta, brilliantly etheric in its basis, tejomaya in its sub- stance, with all the perceptions and forces acting in its intellectual intuitive medium: within, but alien to it the pranic, vayumaya in its basis and substance, below the material inconscience, prithivimaya and jalamaya in its basis and substance. The mind sees in this medium its own contributions to thought and action, conscious- ness and force, but with some difficulty the pranic interception and intervention, with most difficulty the material resistance and response. This ether forms an obstacle to the vijnana contribution which governs, originates, decides the whole action of the triloka. Subsequently a descent from the highest ideality for the pur- pose of farther fixing the transformation of intuitive mentality into intuitive ideality. This has been effected so that even in relaxed states of the system, the thought is ideal and not of the mental substance. The mental form is becoming exceptional, peculiar to a most relaxed condition of the system. Samadhi still distressed by nidra. Dream of half-samadhi turn- ing to vision, incoherence sometimes overpowering, sometimes cor- rected with ease or difficulty to some regular or capricious co- herence. Rupa and vishaya in abeyance.

T 2 of inspired telepathy has begun to be finally idealised, but there is yet a heavy incidence of mentality. The highest gnosis in T 2 is in abeyance. Lipi . There will be the rush of the highest ideality today in the thought and the thought speech; a beginning also in the trikaldrishti tapassiddhi. The inspired telepathic ideality can give the fact to be, but does not command the time and the circumstance. The attempt to do it brought it back to the infinite incertitude of possibility and so to an intuitive mentality just shading off into a thin ideality. Afterwards was a rush of tapasic action of the being, mostly idealised in the intuivity, but pervious to unidealised mental suggestions. Samata, ̧ craddha etc are being made compatible with this tapasic state of the being which formerly brought always disturbance and reaction. The replacement of tamas or mere ̧cama by a tapas based in ̧ cama is the intention. On the whole now laxity of the system can bring it down only to an intuitive ideal state bordering on and pervious to suggestions of the mentality, but not to unideal mentality. The attempt now is to replace this intuitive level by an inspired ideality which will be the state of relaxation and to make the highest ideality the proper action. The rush of the highest ideality has begun, but it is very pervi- ous to the motions of the lower ideality. In its inspirational form it gives freely the fact to be, but not yet the circumstance which had begun to be given with much imperfection by the lower inspiration Vishaya and rupa revived, but began with their old faults, crudeness of rasa, obstruction of gandha and fugitive rupa etc. These are now gradually being set aside. Gandha can now always be commanded in subdued form or intensity by inhalation; spon- taneous gandha is still limited to rarity by the obstruction. The tendency in rasa is to define. In rupa to a doubtful and quickly withdrawn primary stability. The full freedom is not yet established in any of these siddhis.

Highest ideality, but some action of the lower gnosis and the idealised intuivity. Later laxity and apravritti. July 29 Tuesday. Today a more perfect T 2 has been presaged in the lipi and the presage is repeated this morning. T 2 is already growing towards a relative perfection. The ide- ality acting on all levels gives increasingly a prediction which has indeed only a relative certitude, but is generally right in fact of event, always has some justification in telepathic actuality, is able to fix time with a sort of coarse appreciation, but not yet always with an entirely prevailing relative certainty, has some rough initial idea of the arrangement of circumstance, though not yet the fine detail, but all is still disquieted to a certain extent by three of the old difficulties, (1) chiefly, the incertitude caused by a defect of the decisive seeing, (2) an attempt of the telepathy to fill in illegitimately this defect and the defect of range by a false certitude, (3) the intervention of mental will trying to masquerade as trikaldrishti. The incidence of these difficulties is steadily diminishing, but they are still in action. Chitra rupa has been for some days growing in abundance, vividness, life and variety. Sthapatya rupa has now reappeared, this time in full spontaneity, vividness, unlimited variety, perfection of form, truth of life, forms of all kinds of beings, objects, scenes etc. Chitra is developing towards the same perfection. The highest ideality is now attempting in thought perception and tapas to free itself from the lower action. That comes in as an alien intervention, a sign that it is rejected and when the highest gnosis works, it is only so that they can present themselves, piercing from outside through the regular working and finding some similar response in the physical system, but rejected by the gnostic and"},{"pageNumber":1166,"pageContent":"1152 Record of Yoga mental being. When this gnosis works in freedom, then it arouses no pragmatic eagerness in the mental system, tolerates no mechanical tamasic laxity During the rest of the day a variable action of the ideality. In Samadhi dream pages, consecutive reading. Violent mass touch of sparsha, blow-push, in Samadhi. Nidra still oppressive. A general wavering and incertitude. July 30 Wednesday. The highest logistic gnosis is now finally taking up the men- tality. At first in intuitive revelatory, then in intuitive inspired rev- elatory and inspired revelatory, then in full revelatory in the three orders, it invaded all the thought-activities and holds them firmly; even the lapses are full of the revelatory sense and light. The next step is to turn this idealised mentality into the full and true highest logistic gnosis. This is being partly done, but mainly in thought speech and perception; not yet in T 2 . Kamananda is recovering its siddhis in the revelatory form. Great intensity, fullness and stability of all kinds of sparshas in bahirdarshi jagrat as well as antardarshi. Hasya in samata; beginnings of the devi-hasya. Samadhi in the afternoon: in the grasp of nidra. But all the dream in the nidra has turned to ideality and coherence. The old form of incoherent dream was unable to force its way back into the samadhi, except for certain associations of present personality. Much of the dream was in the form of the highest ideality mental or vijnanamaya. Work in the afternoon; subsequently a duller state of the action.

Afterwards again dream of the ordinary kind, though always with a certain kind of coherence. July 31 Thursday. The ideality is now seeking to get rid of the too strong effect of the physical laxity, to keep up a constant action of the thought of gnosis. There is also the movement towards the changing of the idealised revelatory mentality in the physical system to the true gnosis. T 2 is still a difficulty. The main difficulty is the persistence of the recurring tendency to take strong actual possibility for final actuality. This defect is absent when there is no attempt to get the absolute decision; then all is actual possibility relieved by relative certainties. But the attempt at decisive trikaldrishti tapas brings in the hasty and wrong overstresses which mix with, interfere with, replace the true decisions. Decision is often of the inspired gnostic kind which is a strong tapas of perception often fulfilled, but liable to be overborne by a greater power. At the same time the abso- lute revelatory action often intervenes, but is mixed with intuitive seeing of relatively decisive gnostic intuitions and these forceful inspirations of a pragmatic almost absolute certitude. The absolute revelatory action is of the logistis, certain therefore of the moment, but with a background of still greater unperceived possibility which may reverse the natural effect of the decision. K.A is now stronger in force of spontaneous persistence; but the spontaneity is not perfect, nor proof against oblivion by strong absorption or by a wandering of the lax mind to other interests. But it is seeking to get rid of this obstacle by tapas. The action of the ideality bears now most on the T 2 which is being reduced to the revelatory form. Only remnants of the old action are still untransformed and of the mentality. This movement at first turned the mental into the idealised revelatory mentality. Now a revelatory ideal Tapas and trikaldrishti is being insisted on, but mixed with the idealised mentality or chequered by its recur- rence. Telepathy is being changed into perception of the thought stuff as well as the feeling stuff and impulse stuff of the being, while there is also the accompaniment of a telepathic thought-"},{"pageNumber":1168,"pageContent":"1154 Record of Yoga perception reducing these indirect identities into idea and thought speech. The mechanical and pragmatic tapas is being idealised and raised towards or into the truth tapas governed by trikaldrishtic perception.

The movement is final and decisive, but has [ ] 2 still much work to do upon the old matter and manner, before it can be entirely free to work in the revelatory gnosis. K.A is enforcing continuity; the tendency to continuity insists and on the whole prevails in spite of the strong recurrence of its deficiencies. The other siddhis are moving forward, but with a fragmen- tary and intermittent movement, liable still to some action of the principle of relapse. Saundarya, except in one or two details, and utthapana are unable to move forward or break down their barriers. They await the gnostic tapas. The programme for the month has been in part accomplished, in part half accomplished, the other half begun but not completed, in part partially or entirely baffled by the obstruction.

Gnana is in itself perfect in revelatory gnosis, capable even of the hermetic gnosis, but is held back and de- scends so as not to outstrip too much the T 2 .T 2 is advancing to the revelatory power. It is already preparing its final freedom from mentality, normally gnostic and drishtimaya, but burdened with the persistent recurrence of the intervening old mental deficiencies or lower forms of the gnosis. Samadhi fluctuates, sometimes ideal, vigorous, abundant, then again for days together overpowered by nidra. In nidra dream is usually almost coherent, sometimes quite coherent, sometimes fantastic in coherence, sometimes orderly; when the ideality is active or presses on the system, dream-vision comes or dream is changed into vision. Vishaya has established itself in gandha and rasa, often perfect, intense, distinct and of a certain variety, but is often rendered rare by the obstruction. Sparsha is strong in the established sthula touches, often intense in sukshma or sthula-sukshma touc h on the sukshma or sthula body, even in the half sthula or just sthula touches, but the full and free materialisation is still obstructed; this part of the old barrier, its last strong fencing has not yet fallen. Sravana comes with strength or persistence only in the old symbolic sounds, cricket, ticking, bells, thunder etc; the rest has failed to materialise.

Saundarya is established in bhava, but fluctuates in intensity and varies in character; physically there is no advance except in one circumstance. Utthapana is stationary or rather in a state of inhibition. Fifth Chatusthaya . Mental Kali finally and permanently es- tablished, Krishna darshana in the being intermittent in its manifes- tation.

The full revelatory ideality, not the inspired or intuitive revelation, the truth seeing not the pragmatic or resistant mechanical seeing, not the alternation of these two opposite powers, nor even their simul- taneous perception, but their unity and exceeding in the revelatory truth, must be the agent of the perfect siddhi. That therefore must be insisted on always, even in the midst of the persistence of the lower movements. This thing done means a sure rapidity. In the K.A. urgent pragmatic tapas must be replaced by spon- taneity aided by an ideal truth tapas and smarana. An attack of the obstructive external physical mentality which sought to deny all farther speedy or immediate progress, was followed by an immediate and strong advance in the first two chatusthayas. The hasya is already achieving the requisite form and the acceptance of asiddhi as a circumstance and step of siddhi is complete.

The rest of the day mostly a confirming of the first two cha- tusthayas against the attack of Asiddhi. It is now firmer; the mo- ments of clouding prove ineffective; the siddhi perseveres in spite of absence of light or adverse suggestions in the mentality. The oppression of primary utthapana is a little lightened today. The attack on the health still continues in the digestive perversion. In the fragmentary rogas it is held in check, its material effects abro- gated as soon as they are slightly manifested, but is not eliminated from the system. In Samadhi in the afternoon no recovery, except at the end; at night (early morning) ample rupa, but there is still incoherency in the lipi, unideality in the other features, inaction of the thought- powers.

Thought and thought-speech have fixed themselves in an easy normal and brilliant revelatory gnosis of the subordinate intu- itive character in all its degrees. This is also being applied to the mental levels where it is still of the same character, but of a more derivative and less complete and immediate luminosity and certitude.

Behind this is now manifesting the full inspired revelatory dynamic possibilities and certitudes and the full revelatory illuminations. Tapas is of the same character, but with less completeness. This second movement however is as yet from above and has not become either full in itself or the normal thought action. Subsequently, an attempt to bring in the inspired revelation as the type of all the thought especially in T 2 . At first this brought about a descent from the revelatory to the inspired levels. Then there came above, with no hold on the lower being, a highest form of the full (not inspired) revelation, holding in itself the prominent element of inspiration.

The third is still the largest, the second is now about to secure its own perfection, predominance and finality so as to open fully to the first intensity. All is transformed into gnosis that touches the mental system. The intuitional gnosis has completed itself in the revelation and recognised its limits. Certitudes of revelatory intuition exist, but they are only temporary, immediate or relative, as it may be said, contributory and not final certitudes.

A strong movement towards spontaneity combined with vivid distinctness and some variety in rasa, gandha and sparsha. In the latter the sukshma touch is getting more and more sthula, though as yet the border line to full sthulatwa has not been crossed. Samadhi went back to nidra and began turning the touches of dream swapna immediately to ideal forms of gnostic swapna samadhi. At night there is real dream, but more and more a conse- quent and idealised dreaming. Attack on eye, more full, cured, but the tendency remains. Gnosis fixed itself in the second rising to the third intensity. Aug 7. Thursday Gnosis rose to the third intensity of the logistic revelation. As usual the whole mass of thinking with some considerable invasion from the exterior mentality was brought in for transformation to the new form. Some progress was made, but interrupted by the necessity of a long struggle with the eye roga which attacked per- sistently all the morning, was persistently put back, but renewed the attack when on the point of elimination. It is noticeable that all thought was of the ideal kind, though of all ideal kinds, idealised mentality as well as gnosis. The invaders could bring in no intellec- tual suggestion which was not given its luminous ideal translation whether into truth of mentality or gnosis. Even the suggestions of the subconscious physical mind are thus translated into light of gnosis. The lipi therefore which fixed the 5 th &7 th as crucial dates for the gnostic siddhi, is amply justified in fact and in detail. The full conversion to the third intensity, especially of T 2 still remains to be done. Success of the invasion was mostly in the physicality, roga. It amounts to the eye attack suspended during the early afternoon, and some brief repetition of cough and retardation of the central roga.

Saturday Aug 8–9. These two days have been marked by the immensely rapid progress of the gnosis. On the first thought and a certain part of T 2 rose or rather soared up with force into a highest logistic gnosis full of the deputed power of the hermetic and seer ideality. For the most part there was an increase of the inspired pragmatic or dynamic gnosis at this level of intensity, with an undertone of intu- itive present or actual gnosis, corresponding to the old mechanical intellectuality. This took full shape and power on Saturday. T 2 got an immense development. The lower state of the system was at first transformed to the full ideality of all kinds, but chiefly highest ideality of the third intensity, then all to the highest gnosis either full of or penetrated or overshadowed by the influence of the hermetic and seer gnosis. This change was chiefly managed with the violent struggle be- tween the Arogya and the eye attack for an occasion. The struggle resolved itself into a dynamic highest gnostic tapas which sought to override physical rule and limitation and the invading idealised intellectuality aided by the upwellings of the subconscious mind of the body which insisted on the old physical law and habit. When tapas was active it prevailed but on the point of cure ceased and al- lowed the other thought to act and prevail. Thus for two days there has been an oscillation between movements of rapid ideal cure and the fragmentary but still persistent running of the old course of the disease. The tapas insisted (1) on every thought of the subconscient or the invading mentality being idealised and falling on the side of the gnostic truth or knowledge, whether by force of violence or illumination, (2) on every cause of pejoration of the disease being turned by this means into a cause of amelioration and strengthening of the eye and its sight, (3) on every layer of the consciousness to the most obscure physical being brought up into the light and penetrated and possessed by the light of the ideality. During these two days it gained successively all but the most physical flesh layer. The disease was left with a strong tendency to disappearance, but a remnant of persistence in its one last symptom maintained by action of the Roga consciousness on this purely physical layer."},{"pageNumber":1179,"pageContent":"27 July–13 August 1919 1165 T 2 of external happenings is still imperfectly brought into the highest gnosis. Aug 10 Sunday. The highest gnosis on Saturday began reconciling the dynamic inspirational and the actualist intuitional revelation in the pure revelatory union. This is now the thing that is in process. Except part of T 2 and fresh arriving invasional thought which supports the physical asiddhi, all is changed to some kind of this highest gnosis of the first intensity. T 2 also is undergoing the transformation. In Samadhi the same process is in action at a lower stage[,] that of turning all into gnosis at least of the third intensity. The eye attack has succumbed to the gnostic Tapas. This strug- gle has founded the true basis of ideal Arogya and of the whole physical siddhi. The gnostic method is being applied initially to all the members of the sharira; but the whole bodily consciousness has to be converted before it can make rapid headway. K.A has been well founded in the ideal form and is taking over into that form all its previous siddhis. Its obstacles are still mechanical discontinuity (almost destroyed, except as a result of long discontinuity[)], laxity of the system, oblivion by absorption, sleep. The positive dark veil of oblivion has been destroyed by light of gnosis; only the mechanical oblivion survives its disappearance Vishaya and rupa are moving forward deliberately by steps, firmer than before, but there is no mastering rapidity. The quadru- ped form, so long resisted, has now reached a brilliant perfection in chitra and sthapatya which are extraordinarily active whenever they can find a background and attention. K.A is to be established today, according to the lipi, completely and perfectly established tomorrow, confirmed and filled out the day after. At present it has been established in the old way as an insistent presence supported by Tapas in continuity, brought immediately into natural recurrence by smarana, but hampered in both respects by an external obstruction to which the system is still sensible. Mechanical discontinuity is destroyed, but the other obstacles and interruptions have still their incidence."},{"pageNumber":1180,"pageContent":"1166 Record of Yoga Aug 11 Monday. T 2 is arranging itself for a final dismissal of the remnants of positive defect, practically the excesses and deficiencies of stress of tapas, a final conversion of all telepathic perception into the highest logistic ideality of the three times, a taking up of actualistic and dynamic T 2 into the full revelatory gnosis. This is especially in outward things, as the inward is ready for the change to the hermetic ideality which can alone begin the reign of a quite positive certitude. At present all has been reduced to the lowest stress, on the borders between mind and gnosis so as to get the proper action at this lower pitch where deficiency of light gives the largest scope to inferior working and error. The highest logistic T 2 has begun there, but with some weakness. Incertitude and yet justification of both the actualistic and dynamic perceptions is being insisted upon, a repetition of the old method of purification In Samadhi K.A overcame more and more the obstacle of absorption and nidra. It now occupies all the ranges of samadhi and is kept in continuity not only in the antardarshi and lighter swapna, but in the depths of swapna where nidra is not present as an element. But even with nidra it now increasingly comes as a strong recurrence or a difficult but still growing continuity. The defect is that this recurrence tends to break the samadhi, bring back swapna to antardarshi or lighten it to the point where some perception of the outer world clings to the skirts of the inner absorption. The perception in deep swapna is of the pranic basis of the physical body, but also often of the physical body made sensible to the sukshma mind and indriyas. There is also a direction towards the comprehensive many-planed samadhi. The whole major insistence throughout the day has been on the K. Ananda. First of all the normal continuity has been founded in the settling of a great mass of gnostic K. Ananda on a pedestal of rocklike pratistha. Later this has faded and grown, half disap- peared and returned, given place to a less certain fluid Ananda in the laxity of the mind and body, but the net upshot is a continuity only interrupted by sleep and distraction. The difficulties are being rapidly put aside. Laxity of the system no longer of itself brings on discontinuity, but only when it is supported by pramada, mental"},{"pageNumber":1181,"pageContent":"27 July–13 August 1919 1167 distraction. Absorption of thought also no longer imposes obliv- ion, except when there is this loose distraction or pramada of the channel mind in the physicality. Absorption in the object is at best only momentarily discontinuative; a bsorption of reading or writing only when extreme by necessity of attention; but this necessity is no longer really existent, since the gnosis is capable of a wide and multiple dhyana. In the reading it is almost eliminated as a necessary factor, in the writing it is on the point of elimination. The one thing now really to be conquered is the loose mental distraction, a habit and not a necessity of the system. This gained in the evening, was brought out in full and prevented the complete actual continuity. It is assisted by the old desire of the physical mind for release from tapas, rest by inertia. Sleep also, not transformed towards samadhi, is a positive interruption.

They live only by dependence on the lax distraction of the channel mentality. Samadhi is still occupied with the transformation of nidra. On the whole a day of intermediate relaxation. Aug 13 Wednesday The gnosis is now definitely taking up the T 2 from the border line towards the higher region. Hermetic ideality is beginning to show itself in an action from above on the logistic plane, while it more and more moulds the logistis itself into a predominantly hermetic logistis.

August 14 th Thursday The ideality is advancing in the same steps. Thought is perfectly fixed in the gnosis and rises to the hermetic logistic and the seer logistic ideality. T 2 is being transformed by the logistic drashta, not the seer logistis, but with a touch of the hermeneusis. The old mentalities recur in the idealised incertitudes, but only to be interpreted by the light of gnosis. There is no relapse to mentality, but only some lapse to this admissibility of idealised mental sugges- tions; they come from outside and the system is still capable of a subordinate mechanical response to them. The range of T 2 is as yet small, restricted to the habitual field of action, except sometimes when a higher action develops its first luminous suggestions. This higher T 2 is commonest in the lipi. Samadhi is as yet making no masterful progress. It is kept back by the siege of nidra supported by a strong tendency to physical and mental laxity which has reigned for the last two or three days. Rupa and drishya and vishaya have for the time being suspended their advance and are in a state of comparative suspension. The physical siddhi is advancing in the K.A, but under the difficulty of the laxity and distraction. The other physical siddhis are in a state of suspension.

Ananda in the upper body is subject to the dominance of discontinuity; in the lower body the normal tendency is to continuity. At times there comes the perfect siddhi of continuity against which no absorption, even of writing, can prevail. It is this and the pervasion which have to be fixed in an absolute finality. Ananda Purusha darshana and prema are again insisting on their intensity and universality. They are combated by the remnants of the old ahaituka indifferent universality. This is now likely to be overcome with some rapidity. T 2 is now increasingly correct within the logistic limits. But there is the old defect of descending, now not into the mind, but to the lower border intensities open to mental suggestions, for the transformation. All work of progress should be done from the highest attained siddhi, the high lifting up the low, not the low working towards the higher siddhi. This has indeed begun and is even established in the subjectivity but not with a pure and perfect action Aug 15 Friday Hermetic logistic ideality took preliminary possession of the T 2 . This action at once brought to bear effective gnostic tapas on the body. But the lower action still insists, has yet to undergo transformation. The survival of the tamoguna in the body is the chief obstacle; it brings not the absolute, but a relative aprakasha, apravritti, pramada, moha. The day was taken up with the development of this action which marks a decisive turning-point in the gnosis. From the after- noon came, as often before in such crises, a lapse (for adjustment) into idealised mentality, no longer tinged with any dark tamas, but rather a vivid haze of light, a confusion of luminous incerti- tude.

Thought of T 2 is assuming the same freedom and potency; but, especially in the objective subjectivity it is limited by the large element of persistent telepathic incertitude. Nevertheless the certitudes are constantly progressing up the plane of increase. K.A in sleep in the morning almost succeeded in overcoming the depth of nidra, but stopped short on the verge of possession. The Ananda is now increasing again to lay its hold on the system and overcome the distraction. It is attempting to penetrate more and take hold of the fibres of the physical body.

K.A has altered its base of continuity to the more physical Ananda, but as a consequence there is a decrease in the force of continuity which had depended on the ananda of the sukshma body affecting the sthula sharira. The main insistence is now on the increase of the physical occupation and not on the final removal of distraction which is to depend on the intense continuity of Ananda on this new base. In Samadhi in the afternoon a considerable extension of the dream siddhi, but at night a lapse to incoherent and fantastic continuity. Tapas is filling the physical mentality. Aug 20 th Ideality of the seer gnosis in the logistis is now successfully occupying the whole range of the T 2 siddhi; the element of recurrent lower ideality or idealised mentality is approaching the minimum. The extension of Tapas in the physical being proceeds with the working of getting rid of the apravritti of mere prakashamaya ̧ camas; the acquiescence in asiddhi mechanically recurs, but is no longer accepted by the Shakti Strong united spontaneity and stability is finally taking pos- session of the physical manifestation of the lipi, in which these two siddhis had still great difficulty in effecting a perfect coales- cence. The action of the superior gnosis has again taken possession of the logistis. The base is a seer action modified to suit the lower key of the logistis, the force is a hermetic action informing the logistis with its higher luminosity and no longer dependent upon the actuality. This greater force is supreme in thought speech and thought-perception, even though still besieged there by a certain limitation of the surrounding mentality. In T 2 it has begun to act and to evolve a true trikaldrishti acting upon the telepathic seeing and impose on it a certain kind of absolute certitude, as absolute as can be admitted in the logistis.

The element of ideality in the coherence is rising, but not effective, because the purusha is only a passive witness and seer and not as in the samadhi proper a gnostic observer and judge of the things seen or experienced. Nidra must be dispelled to bring about this perfection. Aug 22, 23. 24 Friday, Saturday. Sunday On one side a strong development of hermetised logistis which is taking up the T 2 ; on the other a laxity of the system, a lapse towards something like the old mentality brought about by an invasion of the besieging external mentality and some return of the mental principle of advance through struggle which seemed for a time to have given way finally to the ideal principle of advance through adjustment; even for brief moments in the end (24 th ) strong touches of external asamata. The higher gnosis works from above on this mass and frequently occupies it, but the physical system and mind are relaxed to the old half idealised mentality.

Decisive seer trikaldrishti and tapas are rare, but the dynamic in that type is now common and is being better harmonised with the actualistic ideality raised to the same form. This seer logistis is of the higher form full of a varying measure of hermesis and even some reflection of a superior drishti. Vishaya is again obstructed and occasional; rupa is trying to advance under difficulty. K.A has been much oppressed but is now reviving though not yet in full occupation. On the other hand the new dynamic seer tapas aided by a lower logistic tapas is working strongly for the arogya especially in the two central rogas with some initial effectuality. It is trying also to take hold of the other two members of the physical siddhi, but with no tangible result in the corporeality. Samadhi is half advancing, half stopping under the same diffi- culty. Once there was the old vision of long continuous connected scene, but not this time in a rapid panorama, but steady as in actual life and changing only by the slow and regular movement of the witness through its environment. Towards the end, however, it was invaded by present suggestions and suffered from some fantastic incoherence and mutability, but more in the event and occupying figures than in the scenes. Last night there was a fall back to strong fantasia of present suggestion, though the physical circumstances and happenings were perfectly coherent and rational in their ensemble, connection and changes. In the afternoon for two days there was a difficult gnosis limited to thought and lipi and today a strong overmastering by disputed nidra, after some success of restoration. Occasionally in all these imperfect siddhis there are suggestions not immediately followed up of new develop- ment and progress. The obstacle interferes and drives back towards asiddhi.

T 2 continues to develop the seer certainties and right percep- tion of telepathy, but the besieging confusion and physical tamas continues to limit its action. There is an increasing revival of the force of K.A. The two first chatusthayas depressed by tamas and laxity are recovering their completeness of the siddhi. This time the relapse tendency in the subjectivity has lasted seven days; the ordinary minimum formerly was a fortnight. T 2 has emerged from the confusion and is now exiling all inferior suggestions. The telepathy of the seer logistis is still subject to a survival of mental incertitude and stress prematurely trying to set right the incertitude, but the tendency to automatic justness of appreciation is gaining ground in spite of lapses. Samadhi has recovered full force of logistic ideality in the seer logistis. For the last day or two there has been a movement towards abundance and coherence of other experience than the dream vision.

The obstruction is yielding with much resistance and retardation. The two first siddhis are well reestablished in Devihasya. Aug 27 Wednesday T 2 in spite of laxity is proceeding with accuracy of telepathic incidence. The Surya direction of the Ishwara is prominent and moving towards direct logistic control and guidance. A great increase of physical stability in sadhara, niradhara and chitra lipi, but especially in the niradhara. Also now in sthapatya lipi. In Samadhi in the afternoon at first an oppression of nidra, but strongly resisted by the Shakti which established in spite of it a free flow of the lipi, mostly of the lower logistic character. Subsequently, when the nidra tendency was conquered, there was established a free coherent movement of the seer logistic thought-speech, natural, normal, not as formerly maintained by tapas against obstruction, though a slight negligible obstruction is still present, a similar free- dom, normality and coherent continuity of the seer logistic thought perception, then of the seer logistic lipi, with a beginning even in the profounder depths of samadhi (sushupta swapna), and a com- bination of these three powers, more obstructed, but still sufficient in action and normality. Other features of samadhic experience occurred in briefer snatches, but always significant and sufficient by the aid of the gnostic thought to yield their context and signifi- cance.

Samadhi in the afternoon may now be considered to have well founded its stable basis There is a beginning of the full stability in the abundance of the lipi, as well as in isolated lipis. There is a variation between the three degrees, but each tends to its full duration. The perfect duration exists dissolved, but still present in the three degrees. At night the lipi niradhara and sadhara fixed itself in the third degree of stability; it is also developing positive trikaldrishti of sadhana in the highest seer logistis. Gnosis is leaning more upon the hermetic element in the highest seer logistis and seeking to make this the whole thought instru- mentation, but the laxity still leans to a lesser force of seer logistis burdened with the siege of the old idealised uncertain mentality. The descents to lesser forms are decreasing in frequency and incidence. At night laxity and the lower form of dream; but in the morning some force of increasing lipi in the depths of samadhi. Aug 28 th Thursday. T 2 has now taken possession of the telepathy and is inter- preting all the former movements in an increasing mass of logistic experience. There is an increase of the precise appreciation of ten- dency, including thought tendency and impulse tendency, in the effective force of dynamic seeing Tapas and in the relative or dom- inant telepathic certitude, the certitude resulting from selective idea force in the tendencies and circumstances subject to poten- tial reversal by some greater force. All this is in an intermediate seer logistis containing the hermeneutic element, but not filled and possessed by it.

There was some attempt of the vishaya to break down the obstruction that again prevents its more frequent recurrence and progress, but success was small. Rasa is most apt to come in abun- dance, but not with perfection. Gandha is perfect, but comes with only an occasional spontaneity, otherwise it is obstructed. Both come daily, and are therefore established, but not yet frequently and freely. However by todays effort the tendency in rasa to re- cur has been greatly strengthened, as well as its mass; gandha in inhalation comes more easily; both have profited by the tapas.

Telepathy is becoming more concrete and intimate, sanjna added to prajnana and embridged vyapti, perception in being to perception in idea. Relapse is now chiefly powerful in the physical siddhi. There is a revived sensitiveness to cold and an attempt to restore its results in roga. The tapas however is powerful enough to prevent any strong materialisation.

T 2 this morning has made a large stride forward. A full free and normal thought or jnana of tapas and trikaldrishti has now associated itself with the actual perceptions (vyapti prakamya) and this has enormously increased the rapidity of progress which is now returning to what used to be called the enthusiastic (ie the luminous or fiery or both) and anandamaya rapidity in lipi, jnana and T 2 , while it is partly active in samadhi.

Lipi, script, thought-speech are now firm in the ideality; thought-perception and T 2 are also substantially ideal, but to some extent in laxity of the shakti affected by the mental shadow. They are however being rapidly subjected to thorough idealisation.

The Yoga has been brought up during the last month to ef- fectivity of vijnana. This vijnana is that of the lowest total stage of the triple ideal supermind, the domain of the luminous reason. First, there was the disappearance of the old intellectual into the intuitive mind and buddhi, and not only the thought-being, but the whole being including the consciousness in the body, the phys- ical Ananda was brought up finally into this form, to the total exclusion of the old buddhi, sense and bodily consciousness. Here sattwa of the mind was changed into semi-luminous prakasha and jyoti of the mental intuition, inspiration and revelation, rajas into stress of tapasic will and impulse, tamas into a passive or a heavy shama. Tamas alone preserves in the more physical part of the being something of its old inertia and darkness, not entirely changed into passivity with involved or quiescent prakasha and tapas. This tamas is the cause of the persistence of the physical and other asiddhi. And simultaneously the lower vijnana which represents the in- tellect in the forms of the ideal mind was developing its greater pow- ers and finally turned into the ideal reason. At first this was done with a lower ideal intuition, discri mination, inspiration, revelation which have been developing for a long time, weighted, chequered, shot through, hampered by the defects of the intuitive mentality of the manasa buddhi. The lipi was the first to get clear of the manasa, in the bahirdarshi waking state, the internal antardarshi jagrat followed long after, next the script, next the thought-speech, fi- nally, the thought-perception and only yesterday and not with an absolute perfection the trikaldrishtic thought-perception."},{"pageNumber":1215,"pageContent":"1 March–10 April 1920 1201 The relics of asamata persisted in a fragmentary occasional fashion so long as the defect of mentality in the Shakti has per- sisted in the physical consciousness; it did not belong to the system, but was imposed on it, so long as the outer mind could shoot in its arrows of suggestion or break in for a time and possess the surface. There is still a persistence of vague relics which are being steadily idealised out of existence. This is due to persistence of tamas element in the physical being and is part of laxity or physical depression. It is disappearing in proportion as the ideal Shakti fixes itself in the true vijnana. The chief defect is in insufficient force of hasya and ananda, although the sukham is strong and the hasyam and ananda can always be brought to the surface, but often there is a cloud not of duhkha, but of apravritti of positive ananda, especially of hasyamaya ananda, occasionally an excess of udasinata. Shakti after fixing its base of intuitive mental power in the body, often replaced by ideal forms, is now fixed in a shell of revelatory or representative vijnana filled sometimes with intuition, sometimes with lower revelatory representative, representative- interpretative or interpretative content. Occasionally the higher revelatory drashta Shakti takes momentary possession: there is always now a tendency to its manifestation in the other figures. Virya, shakti (except laghuta sometimes in the physical fatigue or heaviness) are full and sufficient, but depend for their tejas, pravritti etc. on the state of the Devibhava. Devibhava has been established in all its parts, but is not always in the full overt action, because of apravritti of hasya and ishwarabhava. This siddhi awaits the full sraddha and vijnana. Sraddha in the Master of the being is fixed and complete, but sraddha in the Swashakti has been often diminished or overpowered by laxity and failure of siddhi. There is now full faith in the eventual perfection of the three first chatusthayas and the sixth, but incertitude as to physical siddhi, extent of karma and kama, completeness of the mission. This is only occasionally touched by a shadow of positive asraddha and even that now takes the shape of a strong incertitude.

The play of the higher third vijnana is now occupying the system: revelatory intuition has taken the place of other intuitions and is already being turned into the representative, ie the highest intuitive revelatory reason; inspira- tion losing its over-stress and defect of discrimination is almost wholly turned into interpretative ideality, ie the highest inspired revelatory ideal reason, while the full drashta luminous reason has emerged in all its three forms, ie revelation with interpretation but the front representative, 2 d the front interpretative with intuition involved in the drishti, 3 d the whole drishti with the two other powers taken into the drishti. There are various combinations and permutations. This is completest in lipi, script and thought-speech; thought-perception is a little weighted down towards the intuitive, revelatory intuitive, or representative forms, but the others occur and take the field when there is full action of the vijnana Shakti. T 2 is now able to act with certitude, but this is not yet complete; the old telepathic form still labours to predominate. Telepathy of thought is developing, but chiefly of thought impulse, feeling, intention, not of pure thought; the whole mind of animals can be seen, but only partially the mind of men.

Samadhi has fixed the right ideal lipi in the antardarshi, developed many of its elements, but is obstructed by nidra in its further or at least in its rapid progress.

The change is almost, but not quite or firmly complete. There is still persistence of old fragments of roga and the two or three chronic maladies. Sometimes two of them seem on the point of disappearing, but are then able to reassert their action. Primary utthapana fluctuates, saundarya is not able to manifest except in bhava. Brahmadarshana made itself perfect in the Ananda on the mental vijnanamaya plane, it has had to sink back into vijnana and mentalised vijnana in order to redevelop on the ideal plane.

The shakti in the body has suddenly changed its base from the fixed revelatory intuitive to the representative vijnana. There is already a tendency to change that to the interpretative basis. A rapid alteration of the basic and immediately surrounding consciousness into the representative and interpretative forms of the vijnana has begun. The other idealities will still persist for a time; they must replace the imperfect idealities which till now have been coming in from the outside. The Ananda-darshana is also passing through the same phase, but has not yet altogether got rid of the recurrence of mental vijnana and Ananda on the mental plane. These are associated with certain forms, the latter Ananda being inspirational in its idiom, persist repeatedly in attaching themselves to them, and can as yet only be rejected by second thought or effort of Tapas. An attempt to accept and transform inspirational-interpre- tative overstress led to the outside mind breaking through and getting in some of its movements. It cannot hold, but brought the recurrent Asamata which is accustomed to attend failure of Satya and Tapas. There is some beginning of the same changes in the thought telepathy.

The remnants of mental stuff floating about have become mostly inef- fective except for limitation. The lower idealities act as an inferior accompaniment to the higher vijnana or take its place in lax mo- ments. Ananda is recovering intensity and continuity, but still needs the smarana. It varies between the mental and the ideal forms, men- tal in laxity, ideal when supported by the tapas, but now contrary to what had been the rule hitherto the ideal are the more intense. In Samadhi lipi is almost entirely coherent, though not in any great mass, still in longer continuities than before. The other elements are also regularising themselves a little. Lipi is ideal in Samadhi, thought sometimes falls into the mentalised ideal at least in physical level and in intensity. The other members, eg rupa, do not seem yet to be vijnanamaya.

This is no longer a necessity, but a survival of habitude. The con- tinuity has begun to prevail in this matter. The pervasiveness of the Ananda is also being prepared on a firmer foundation.

The continuity remained almost throughout during the morning while writing a letter, an unprecedented circumstance. The lighter samadhi was constant in the Ananda. The deeper swapna samadhi is now getting free of nidra, except a shadow which gives a remoteness and sunless consciousness unfavourable to actuality. At the worst it is still samadhi, though nidramaya; g ˆ adha-supta swapna. The Ananda in this deeper samadhi lost at first its continuity, and with it its mass, suffering diminution, recurred only in sharp and keen pro- longed and frequent touches of great but narrow intensity which caused a spasm in the body and brought back the lighter state and then outer body consciousness. The samadhistha body con- sciousness is frequent, but of short duration. The more massed continuous Ananda occurred finally in all but the deepest supta swapna, but at a low power and remained half-involved, involved or lost in the nidramaya. The development has been extremely rapid and promises the complete conquest of swapna samadhi by the Ananda, as well as the complete expulsion of day nidra by samadhi. The next step will be the replacement of the profounder real nidra at night by swapna samadhi and sushupti. Sushupti here will not be sunya or alakshana, but vijnanamaya, anandamaya, chaitanyamaya, sanmaya. Position now makes only a difference of degree, not of con- tinuity in Ananda. Lying, it tends to be extremely intense, intense but less or of varying force in seated position, uncertain in stand- ing posture. Walking has an effect of diminution of intensity.

This shows that the physical consciousness has gone far in a first idealisation. Pervasiveness is now becoming final, only the pervasion of the head offers some difficulty: there it is not, but tends to be quite continuous. In deeper samadhi Ananda sometimes shifts from head to body and body to head. This diminishes the constancy of the Ananda. But there are signs that this difficulty will not be long prevalent. Lipi in the deep samadhi gains constantly in power and co- herence. Rupa suddenly manifested perfect stability in one perfect form (a watch) prolonged for several minutes, though occasionally clouded over, yet reappearing, sometimes with a slight change of details. This endured through both swapna and deep antardarshi or half jagrat half swapna. For the rest, the rupa etc was spasmodic and disordered today, except for snatches. T 2 on the lower level is now becoming fuller and more ordered and certain, though still shot through with inaccurate suggestions, ie wrong stresses. The struggle is between ideal perception of pos- sibility (actualities even being suggested as possibilities) attended often with false stress of certitude and ideal perception of actual- ity (possibilities being seen as actual forces unfulfilled or partially effected) with right stress of certitude. Both come from the outer consciousness and are not native to the adhara. Only the higher vijnana on the highest or middle level is native to the adhara. The T 2 and with it other siddhis dropped towards the lowest levels even with some hint of the mentality. Ananda was lowered to an interrupted continuity and suffered much intrusion of the mental forms. Now the highest vijnana is again at work in the thought-siddhi and a recovery is in progress. Thought siddhi with some T 2 recovered and founded itself more firmly than before in the interpretative vijnana. All other movements, when they occur, are not accepted or invested with credit, except in so far as they are touched by the drashtri vijnana. Ananda took some time in emerging from the interrupted con- tinuity. The full intensity continued through a fairly long spell of reading, but was diminished and interrupted at the close.

Dream, while retaining its incon- sequence, is sometimes curiously idealised in some of its incidents or features Thursday Mar 4. The Ananda varies now between three conditions. At night interruption, but restorable by smarana. Restoration automatic after rising. At daytime (except for samadhi) a highest, middle or a diminished condition. The marks of the last are interrupted continuity, much intrusion and some persistence of mental forms, a low or varying intensity. The marks of the first and second are uninterrupted continuity, exclusion of mental forms, sustained or great intensities; but the second is prone to the inspirational, the first to the interpretative vijnana. Tapas is still necessary for the first, partially or initially necessary for the second condition. T 2 varies also between three conditions. The lowest is a diluted revelatory vijnana with mixture of other, often now mentally en- cased suggestions, and is afflicted with confusion and incertitude. The middle is a higher representative form, but touched by lower suggestions, into which stress of tapas or hasty certitude brings an element of error, and which is only correct when limited to immediate balancing trikaldrishti. The highest is interpretative and gives correct finalities. The difficulty of taking up all detail into the highest form is not yet overcome. Other siddhis are not moving much, but there is a beginning of final idealisation of rupa and vishaya, especially gandha and rasa. T 2 in the lowest scale of the interpretative vijnana has regu- larised itself in place of the revelatory ideal seeing, excluding the lower suggestions, which recur less frequently and are given no valid credit. They cannot be easily excised altogether, until their place has been taken by the highest vijnana. This can only give immedi- ate certitudes.

Samadhi is obstructed but even in obstruction maintains with a little impairment its recent strongest gains. Mar. 5. Friday The drishti now promises to take the place of the interpretative form in T 2 and thought-siddhi. This is at first being done or rather prepared by a slow and fluctuating movement.

In the afternoon samadhi oppressed by nidra. Shama darkened by some element of tamas in the system; a depression or relative inactivity of tapas. The drishti has emerged in the evening in T 2 and thought- siddhi, but has not a complete hold or satisfying fullness. In Ananda the tendency is to a fluctuation between the second condition and an interpretative drishti in the form of the Ananda, a higher version"},{"pageNumber":1224,"pageContent":"1210 Record of Yoga of the third condition. But the hold is still wanting in strength and continuous insistence. Mar 6 Saturday The endeavour today has been to get rid entirely of the lower and mediary forms, but this attempt brought an invasion of these forms, a confusion and a stressing of the difficulty of adjustment to the old proportions of a struggle. The siddhi on its positive side progresses, as has been lately more and more the rule in such crises, in the midst of the confusion. Thought-siddhi frequently manifests the highest form of the drashtri reason, T 2 occasionally gets at some incomplete form of it. But the main movement has been the persistent increasing rejection of the lowest forms in spite of their persistent recurrence; they cannot long hold the system and are beginning to lose power at all to put their grasp on the thought- consciousness. The mediary forms on the other hand penetrated or not by the drishti lay a strong temporary hold, persist for a long time, prevent the highest drishti, and when it manifests, rush into its place and try to do its functions and imitate its manner. This is the old method of progress. But the rule insisted on at present is that of the higher replacing and resuming the lower powers, not of the lower seizing on the higher and drawing them down to their level. This rule sometimes act[s] but cannot as yet assert its firm dominance. Ananda continues to vary between its different formations, but now on the whole the tendency is to bare continuity of the highest condition (not its full per vasion, intensity and possession) in smarana. There is now a movement towards possession or at least pervasion in smarana. The thought and with a less certainty the T 2 has now entered with some firmness on the same state as the script and lipi in which the various forms all belong to the full ideality and belong to the drishti with rarer deviations to the lesser forms still penetrated and covertly possessed by the drishti.

Strong dream coherence in nidra. Mar 7. Sunday. The T 2 is proceeding with the development of the drishti. The movement goes much over old ground and confirms the stable hold of the drishti in the lesser ideal action. First, the lower form has been successfully converted; this gives near future and present potentialities valued in the terms and powers of the immediate actuality and frequently fulfilled according to the exact balance seen of the immediate present and future actuality, but barren of absolute future certitudes. Now the mediary form has been con- verted. This takes up the immediate potentialities, includes distant ones, and deals more largely with near and far potential, relative, temporary and isolated certitudes. But the near is more strongly and frequently dealt with than the farther, the farther more than the very distant; the last is still very rare. The chief difficulty is the survival of uncertain or self-regardingly positive stress, and this though less ignorant and vehement than in the mentality, less positive than in the lower idealities, is still sufficient to hamper the action of the highest drishti. The defect can only be cured by full and complete unification of knowledge and Tapas There is movement again in the rupa, in the tendency of drishti idealisation, but as yet this is still embarrassed by the persistence of inspired and intuitive mental forms. S. [Sharira] Ananda is depressed towards the inspirational mentality and intuition, but this form also is being taken up by the drishti. Sahaituka is rapidly undergoing the same change, but not yet with perfection. There is occasional basic or pervasive force of the higher drastri ananda. Rupa has successfully idealised itself in all its forms after some difficulty with those that were full of the inspirational mentality. The crude forms are not unoften perfect, but not usually so, except in the ghana and developed crude, but often nearly perfect. The old persistent habit of the crude stuff to be doubtful of form, and change rapidly often before creating a perfect form with an initial stability is still obstinate. This is an obstacle also to the stability."},{"pageNumber":1226,"pageContent":"1212 Record of Yoga At the same time stability [and] perfection of form and material is increasing; and there is sometimes stability of the full second and even the third degree. This is also coming in a half crude, half- ghana.

Its action is in the already oc- cupied province, but it is there removing all sources of confusion. Also in the telepathic trikaldrishti. One or two true ghanas have for the first time appeared with the primary stability out of the mass of crude material in daylight; this has the advantage of appearance and stability frankly fronting the physical eye. Other forms present themselves obliquely or dart into the direct field of vision and stay there for a moment or two or three moments or more. Some ghanas of that kind have direct under the eye a primary stability. There is now occasional possession by the drashtri Ananda in the sharira; but there is as yet no harmonious or complete combi- nation of the pervasion, possession and basic Ananda. The Tapas is now working to establish it in the homogeneity of the drishti, but the kind of drishti is not yet securely the same, nor is the possession then complete and stable. A remarkable progress has been suddenly made in T 2 by the taking up of the mediary form by the highest drishti. There is now a mass of certitudes of various degrees and qualities, but governed by an increasing force of absolute certitude. The element of over or under stress remains, but is now ma de subordinate.

The highest drishti is finally imposing itself and completing its taking up of the lower movements in T 2 , thought-speech, script and thought-perception. It is the beginning of the final process in the luminous ideal reason. Sharira Ananda is again reviving, but as yet only in the basic Ananda. A strong invasion of Tamas in body and physical mind dis- pelled by the drashtri vijnana which it failed to suspend or lower in character. There is now an invasion of confused luminous lower ideality, and this fails to suspend, but tends to dilute and lower the character of the vijnana. The highest drashtri Tapas is now at work on the Yoga. The ideal Ananda is now being imposed on the vishayas; it is dominant and almost perfect in darshana, though still too much mixed with or sometimes lowered towards the inferior forms in the seeing of the human figure. It still sinks in the rest by any lowering of the shakti, but its universal finality has been established beyond serious retardation. The lipi has succeeded in establishing finally the full dominance of the drashtri vijnana. This is also accomplished in the script, though here there is a strong tendency still to an invasion by the inspirational intuitive thought-perception. The same siddhi seems also to be assured in the thought-speech in the vijnana; but there are still intrusions of the lower forms from the exterior atmosphere. The highest drishti may also be considered to be siddha in the jnana, but not yet in the T 2 thought-perception. Mar 14 Sunday.

The process however is still incomplete. At the same time certitude of immediate result and movement is gaining greatly in force and amplitude. This must be the next movement to insist always on sight and certitude. When it is complete, there will be the completion of the ideal reason. All forms of the rupa are idealised, except the crude, and this after some relapse is again and more firmly becoming vijnanamaya. It is unideal only in the process and in some occasional results of uncertain formation. On the other hand swapna Samadhi has been violently invaded by dream and oppressed by mentality, fantasy and incoherence. Sraddha bhagavati swashaktyam is approaching completion, but there is still doubt as to the immediate power and the eventual fullness of yoga siddhi and karma siddhi. The crude lipi is idealised and even in the process of uncertain formation there is only a momentary survival of the mental matter which is now become a suggestion rather than a real element. The mental state is being at times brought back in the laxity in order to be overpowered by the drishti.

As a next step slow formation is disappearing, has almost dis- appeared and what prevails now is immediate imperfect or uncer- tain, sometimes very imperfect or uncertain formation; the perfect complete crude is rare, the perfect incomplete more common. The sadhara forms in which the unideality persisted, are also now being rectified; this has been done almost instantaneously, but not yet quite so completely as in the niradhara. The K. [Kama] Ananda has been oppressed by the unideal forms, but there is now a pressure of Tapas to get rid of this covering oppression. The crude rupa is now moving towards the elimination of inchoate or very imperfect and uncertain forms; the more definite rupas, complete or incomplete, perfect or partially perfect, wholly ideal or mental-ideal, are becoming more common. The chief diffi- culty is that the animal and human forms are resisted in this rupa and to evolve them the Akasha resorts to the old method of slow uncertain formation. Though no longer slow, it is still uncertain and produces the inchoate, imperfect and soon changing or uncertain figures. The possessional Ananda is now always ideal, the basic is now developing ideal finality, the pervasive commencing the same movement. This is being effected against a strong siege of obstruc- tion.

Rupa at night assumed the same siddhi as in the daytime, but in its different kind of chhaya, tejah and jyoti. Trikaldrishti, but not in full abundance and perfection.

March 18–24 The siddhi has progressed in spite of a heavy obstruction of physical tamas. The main progress is that all the members of the vijnana have now definitely fixed themselves in the true ideality (it is only in laxity that there is some touch of idealised mentality) and now including T 2 in the drishti. All except T 2 are entirely vijnanamaya. T 2 has developed accurate drishti in the third condition and decisive trikaldrishti in the first condition. The common action is in the third; but it is now being changed to the second condition, that is right perception of possibility including right perception of immediate actuality. The first is increasing in power and fixing its certitudes on the others. The process is as yet far from complete, but is progressing with sufficient rapidity of transmutation. Samadhi is developing vijnana action in spite of tamas and nidra. Rupa is still hampered by the obstruction and cannot yet get rid of imperfect crude forms. But perfect crude forms (crude, ghana crude, developed crude) and crude ghana and developed are be- coming more common before the eye. The freedom of rupa is much denied and impeded.

The development of the vijnana in the thought-siddhi is still the main movement. Thought-speech and thought-perception are now normally fixed in the drishti. There are occasional drops and deviations, especially in laxity, but the laxity is now only usual in the evening and night and as a result in the early morning. It is being slowly got rid of in spite of the great siege and pressure of the external mind and its tamas. Thought-speech and perception have been perfected in the two lower orders of the drishti; they are already perfect in the first order, but that has been held back; it is now manifesting and has to take possession of the others. The main difficulty is still in T 2 . T 2 (trikaldrishti side of the double power) is now fixed nor- mally in the drishti. The stress has been on the telepathic drishti which gives the fact and tendency [of] actual and potential forces in action. Now the self-existent drishti is being developed which gives the certitudes. Certitudes of actuality (the third condition) are now more or less perfect, except in their extension: these give the certitude of immediate actualities and also of immediate or almost immediate dominant possibilities. It deals with the telepathies, but in the telepathies the possibilities of linked present and future action etc predominate, in the other the certitudes. This third condition corresponds in the drishti to the intuition, but is not revelatory intu- ition, but a high intuitively revelatory vision. Certitudes of remoter potentiality are now fixing themselves in perfection, but are as yet more limited and less disengaged from the telepathies.

Samata is perfect except for an occasional physical touch of asamata of great weak- ness which does not affect the mind, but only the physical shell of the pranic consciousness. The sama ananda is however still in need of greater development; its deficiency is due to the general withholding of intensity of Ananda, for even in the vijnana there is asu, a modified prakasha, but not the full Ananda. There is full sukham and prasada, but not full hasya in the samata.

Thought is now fixed in the vijnana except for the effect produced by the continuous siege of the surrounding envelope of mental intelligence. This is now distant and not close to the consciousness, but is still allowed full right of penetration and in- vasion. The old policy of the Kavacha seems to have been wholly abandoned. This effect is first, that of an increasing of the vijnana thought in the mental matter where it is still vijnanamaya, but with a strong infusion of mental limitation and incertitude; secondly, when the thought is more strongly vijnanamaya, ideal in the vi- jnana, a dilution by or an accompaniment of mentality; at other times, the thought is clearly and solely vijnana, but still limited by the environment of mental intelligence. These effects are strongest in the T 2 ; but affect the general thought-perception which does not now usually act as a separate power. The thought-speech is vijnana- maya except for a very small element of diluted vijnana, and when the thought-speech is active, except in great laxity or exercises of the idealised imagination, thought-perception also rises in vijnana intensity and fullness. Lipi and script are entirely ideal, but with a tendency towards the intuitivity saved by drishti, because of the siege of the mental intelligence.

The atmosphere of the physical mind is no longer allowed to give for long a sanction to it; but it still holds strongly to the atmosphere of the physical and to some extent of the psychic prana, and this effects a siege and retardation of the siddhi.

It is now increasing[ly] stable in the crude form with an increasing force of vivid completeness, but the imperfect forms are still obstinate in recurrence. The formless material quickly takes form, but the form is sometimes though not usually inchoate, often imperfect, perfect only by overcoming of the siege of obstruction in the akasha.

Sharira can make no definite progress against the obstruction. April 6–10 The vijnana is steadily getting the better of the still persistent tamas and the progress continues. After a slight lapse towards the mental recurrence the thought is more firmly fixed in the gnosis.

Now even the forms of thought which were held most by the mental form, eg imagination etc, are captured by the vijnana drishti. The mental siege still continues, but is less sustained and effective.

Vishayananda is revelatory vijnanamaya. Raudra also is vijnanamaya, and vaidyuta. The physical ananda continues in antardarshi and in the lighter swapna, but is there subject to cessation or intermittence. June 8. After a long indulgence of the environmental invasion, the final conversion of the assured ideality to the interpretative logisti- cal vijnana has commenced and immediately taken a considerable extension. All concentrated thought and thought-speech has begun to be fixedly of that character, as also the T 2 . This is being effected not by select movements and a gradual extension, but with an initially instantaneous generality and rapidity in a crowded activity of thought-suggestions. The Rupa is beginning to press down again the barrier of obstruction. The developed forms are still only of an initial stabil- ity, the ghana and ghana developed either that or of a primary or secondary, the crude of a primary, secondary or sometimes tertiary stability. The tendency in the latter is to long stability. The lipi is fixing itself in freely in the interpretative vijnana; all former movements of the kind were only initial and preparatory; this is the last and definite movement.

The automatic and the forced cessation are being eliminated from the system, only the oblivious and the sleep cessation remain as effective obstacles. The samadhi in the afternoon almost got rid of lipi incoher- ence. The interpretative vijnana took firm hold on thought speech and thought perception in the antardarshi. Nidra obscurity almost nonexistent, nidra weight of inclusion is still there. In the evening and at night a laxity of the Shakti and some interruption, not complete, of the results acquired in the day- time. June 9. The laxity continued during the morning. Samadhi in the afternoon directed to farther idealisation of the swapna, removal of fantasy, lipi incoherence, instability and fragmentariness of rupa, shabda etc. There is a detailed initial but not yet quite definite or organised progress. The thought in the afternoon normalised interpretative vijnana in the revelatory and representative consciousness-substance. This movement extended to tapas and trikaldrishti. Indefinite thought from the environment is not yet always of the perfect logistis. A highest logistis has for some time been present in the interpretative and other form or substance. It is now beginning to prepare to take full possession. This will be the end of the logistic movement, the completion of the vijnana reason. Ananda of the interpretative fashion acclimatised in the body. Physical Ananda is now of three moulds, interpretative, revelatory and as a survival the inspirational and (rarely, almost never) other lower kind[s] of vijnana. For the first time developed or rather perfect rupa of the secondary-tertiary stability. As yet the longer stabilities except in the crude rupa are still isolated or else a rather frequent exception. The initial predominates when there is rapidity and frequency of the crude and developed rupa. The thought since yesterday has begun to be attended with physical Ananda confined to the head region (where the K A has been till now exceptional, the ordinary pervasion being in the rest"},{"pageNumber":1244,"pageContent":"1230 Record of Yoga of the body) and the brain-stuff, but this now tends to become normal and to join itself to the Ananda in the rest of the body. The Ananda Darshana now tends to be the infinite shuddha Ananda taking up all the rest, but still on the vijnana level. The old mental shuddha ananta Ananda recurs in the first movement as a coating to the vijnana Ananda, but changes easily to the vijnana shuddha Ananta. The possibilities are now entirely normalised in the interpre- tative trikaldrishti, the authentic decisive is beginning to disengage itself more clearly, but has often a telepathic character from above which while fulfilling itself in the eventual actuality, remains with- out any certitude for the reason. An irruption still occasionally takes place of the lesser telepathic idealities which shows that the whole process of conversion is not yet completed. The thought and other prakamya vyapti is still of the lower inefficient and in the case of the thought initial and fragmentary character. Thought intention and thought substance are more easily accurate than pure thought perception. June 10 Thursday. Today the Yoga is more hampered than on any day since the beginning of the fresh stream of progress. The principal advance has been in the T 2 , where the telepathies of actuality have been raised to the highest power of the logistis and those of modifying possibility strongly confirmed in the interpretative vijnana. Occasionally the tertiary or decisive vijnana acts, but where it does not pressure on the possibility by Tapas brings a confusion of unreliable certitudes. Rupa in the ghana etc is hesitating between initial and primary stabilities. The samadhi was more obstructed by nidra, though not of an obscure nature. Ananda is obstructed and only constant in smarana, though the full intensity is not present. In the afternoon a change.

Tapas is taking its right place as telepathies have done; the union of decisive Tapas and trik. certitude is not yet effected. June 12 Saturday. Trikaldrishti pursues its organisation, but while the actualities grow constantly in power and certainty, the unrealised possibilities and decisive certitudes are not yet in the complete higher vijnana- maya development. There are still excessive stresses on possibility. At the same time the higher certitudes are becoming more frequent and more positive to the reason Rupa is increasing tertiary stability in the ghana and developed crude, and attempting to bring in the secondary in the other rupas. Lipi now has frequent tertiary stability in the Akasha. There is also an incipient movement towards variety of Rupa Ananda already settled in the intenser sa-smarana, though al- ways feeble and interrupted from the evening, is fixing automatical constancy, so that after oblivion there is no need of mental smarana, the body keeping the memory whether of continuous but unnoted or of suppressed but still implicitly present Ananda. The base of vijnanamaya organisation is being laid in the deci- sive T 2 , and prepared in the prakamya-vyapti of thought intention: it is already strong as regards sensational tendency and impulse. Rupa has now definitely begun secondary stability of ghana and developed rupas, but mostly still in the side-seen images, those that stand direct before the eye are less vivid and less stable. Primary stability is still the ordinary movement, but now it is less fugitive, less inclined to the initial and more to the secondary duration."},{"pageNumber":1246,"pageContent":"1232 Record of Yoga There is now a constancy of the penetrative more physical Ananda contained in the sthula fibres; the ananda of the sukshma body affecting the sthula alternates or sometimes coexists with it.

June 13 Sunday There is a larger right vijnana of possibilities and telepathic relative certitudes and the decisive telepathic trikaldrishti of precise detail (only of the immediate future) is beginning to found itself, as yet imperfectly, on a larger basis. Tertiary stability is now very common in crude rupa; primary and secondary prevail in the rest under the direct gaze, but tertiary has begun to appear in side images and promises even in the direct images. There is more frequent cerebral and thought Ananda. The Ananda still fluctuates and the Ananda without smarana fails still to fix itself with a final possession. Each of the three siddhis which are being rapidly pushed forward has taken a farther step in advance. The decisive trikaldrishti certitudes are beginning to become near, actual and sure in telepathic trikaldrishtis of the immediate future, filling them as a first step to their replacement. The rupa is increasing tertiary stabilities; initial tertiaries have come repeatedly in the direct image and final tertiary has made its appearance in the side images. Both are now common in the crude. Ananda is deepening its insistent frequency and intensity in spite of interruption by oblivion.

Today it promises to be throughout continuous by recurrence. June 14 th –15 th Ananda deepens steadily, but the obstruction of forgetfulness at the periodic time still remains operative. Rupa has now established the first tertiary stabilities; the more prolonged are still occasional only. Trikaldrishti also is gradually confirming in the telepathic fig- ure. Samadhi in the afternoon is now idealised in all its parts, but weak in the incidents, except in scene and event in scene which are attaining to a perfect stability. The organisation for utility is not yet ready to commence. June 16 th Wednesday. The Tapas which was held back in favour of the trikaldrishti is now being definitely taken up for perfection. At first there was the increased but uncertain effectivity of tapas and a renewal of the difficulty of discord between the telepathic form of the two siddhis, then the same difficulty in tapas as in trikaldrishti between the telepathic and the definitive. Finally, an initial fusion has been effected between trikaldrishti and tapas. Rupa is trying to develop perfect stability; there is the poten- tiality, but not yet the actual presence. Ananda has hitherto fluctuated between periods of intensity and periods of depression. Formerly the latter used to last for long periods, now there is only comparative depression on alternate days and fluctuation in the day itself, greater strength in the morning, less with much interruption in the afternoon and evening, at night cessation or only occasional presence. The depression on alternate days is being eliminated. The continuity in the morning is every day greater and tends to conquer the oblivion; even when writing the body retains except in great absorption of the thought-mind the physical Ananda."},{"pageNumber":1248,"pageContent":"1234 Record of Yoga The ananta Ananda of the darshana has now definitely entered and for the present fixed itself in the vijnana form corresponding to that attained in the rest of the chaitanya. June 17 t . h . Thursday. The T 2 for a time was confused by an irruption of incerti- tudes from outside attended by an extension of relative certitudes in the revelatory and interpretative telepathies. Subsequently the supreme logistis reappeared and began to organise certitude of detail, circumstance and succession. Rupa is now making prolonged tertiary and perfect stability the normal thing in crude of all kinds and beginning to develop it in crude developed and crude ghana. In side images they are becoming very frequent, though they do not yet predominate. The attempt to extend them to direct images of the full ghana and developed kinds is obstinately obstructed in the physical akasha. The long existing tendency to snatch away the rupa as soon as possible after appearance, even if it is [in its] nature perfectly stable, is the obstacle to be eliminated. Ananda has fixed itself with a more basic firmness in the cere- bral possession and the physical ananda of thought-speech and thought-possession which was till now only a faint preshadow- ing, has become definite and universal. The recurrence of asiddha thought and of interruptions of possession is however still persis- tent, though less powerful than before. Most of the conditions of perfect Ananda (except, mainly, the downward current and the fu- sion of the five anandas, though the latter has made some progress) is now accomplished in the basis. Ananda persisted in the daily period of relaxation, in the after- noon, evening and at night. The automatic tendency to relaxation is therefore now ended; only that created by oblivion and the oblivion itself have to be conquered. June 18 th Friday.

June 19 th Saturday. The continuous steady rapidity of the siddhi upset today by a revolutionary attempt to substitute at once the srauta for the logistic vijnana. This was attended and frustrated by an invasion of asiddhi such as had not occurred for some months past including even an attack on the samata. Insistent suggestion of asamata amounting to duhkha in the prana and impatience in the buddhi in the physical consciousness, not radical but strongly disturbi ng the outer physical fibres. This duhkha is now mingled with ananda when it enters the system and cannot preserve its pure character. Its recurrence however is a retardatory phenomenon foreign to the new settled course of the sadhana. Suggestion also, but less violent of asraddha, amounting in effect not to radical asraddha but to disbelief in the method, absence of the feeling of a possessing guidance by the Ishwara that is felt as before behind a veil or only at the summit, and a sense of the possibility of postponement of siddhi. At the same time it is felt that a greater siddhi is preparing. An Ananda of a much greater potentiality of continuity, per- vasion, largeness and intensity felt on the vijnana summit and descending into the sukshma body, but this is unable to make itself except at intervals intimate to the system. Meanwhile the constant possession of the sthula body by the revelatory has been taken away and that body is empty except of a greater tendency of response. The sukshma body is visited by a more continuous Ananda less affected, except at first by want of smarana or attention, more pervasive from above, more naturally intense, affecting the sthula without being established in it or possessing it, but not yet organised nor having a firm close hold even of the subtle body. It is at once more continuous and less intimately continuous. All the old asiddhis are suggested, including the dependence on posture. The struggle has not yet been determined in the sense of the greater organised siddhi. The jnana etc are affected in a similar direction. The system"},{"pageNumber":1250,"pageContent":"1236 Record of Yoga is invaded by a vague and confused idealised mentality which is turned to an imperfect revelatory ideality when it enters the system and its surrounding atmosphere. The vijnana thought and T 2 occur, but do not closely hold the system as for a long time they have been doing. There is nothing left but to await the issue of the struggle. Ananda during the time set apart for the samadhi insistent on possession of the sthula body, but a possession by penetration, not a reawakening of the hold on the sthula fibres. The period of laxity was to some extent restored today, not entirely, for there was a frequent recurrence of Ananda, but as a result of smarana. In the evening the Ananda of the sthula body was brought back to a certain extent, but without the firm hold and sure intensity that had seemed fixed in finality. The Ananda in the sukshma body was for a time made constant, the ananda of thought universalised and intensified; these took on the form of the representative, interpretative and highest logistis. All this had to be done by a certain force of Tapas and therefore cannot be considered as a final siddhi. The bodily consciousness became during the same time first revelatory representative and representative, then representative interpretative and interpretative, then the highest logistic vijnana.

Seven new movements are indicated of which four have begun to realise themselves in an initial action. Thought is manifesting a highest logistic movement which is ready to change into the srauta vijnana.

First; it did not notice the flowertree because its mind was fixed on some more distant object present to its instinctive memory, but"},{"pageNumber":1298,"pageContent":"1284 Record of Yoga by a law of the mind it received subconsciously the impression of the scent from the flowers. By the time it reached the wall this came up to the supraliminal mind as a vague but powerful sense of something missed and attractive on the way. Working through the vital instincts & cravings by vital impulse which dominantly deter- mines the movements of the insect, this sense immediately enforced a backward flight. If the other butterfly had not intervened, it is possible that at the second contact with the scent of the flowers, the vague sense would have identified itself, consciously or subcon- sciously, with a definite supraliminal expression & the descent on the flowers would have been determined, but the diversion once made, the vagueness not only remained, but the impression was half obliterated and only the idea of return to something in the distance remained. This, however, was strong enough to divert the insect from its fellow, especially as the latter was concerned with the flowers and did not respond to the advances made. Hence the farther pursuit of the flight backward."},{"pageNumber":1299,"pageContent":"1285 SORTILEGES OF MAY AND JUNE 1912 Sortileges 20 t . h . May. 1912.

This is the only form of script which has any practical connection with the yoga, not with its fulfilment, but with the action. Wherever the action has to be coordinated, this script will arrange the coordination. There are four divisions of the Karma, literary, religious, practical, social. The first of these is ready for coordination. —— The literary Karma falls under three heads poetry, prose and scholarship. The poetry again, under three, epic, dramatic and the minor forms which again include narrative, lyric and reflective. Besides these there is humorous & satirical poetry and translation. All forms have to be attempted & all from the beginning The prose comprises philosophical writings, fiction and essay in its many forms (treatise, article, essay, pamphlet, notes, review etc.). The fiction includes romance, ordinary novel and short stories. The philosophy includes Veda, Vedanta & explanation of other forms of Hindu thought & scripture. Scholarship covers the new system of philology, explanation of Veda with scholastic justification, more translation & comment on Sanscrit writings. To begin with you have to complete The Commentary on the Kena Upanishad, The Introduction to the Study of the Upanishads and a book on Yoga (Philosophy); the two dramas and a third; the revision of your other poems; the completion of the Stone of Ishtar and a number of occasional verses (Poetry); the Idylls of the Occult, The Return of Moro Giafferi and The Siege of Mathura (Prose fiction); your study of the Vedas (first mandala) along with an explanation of the Vedic Gods (the Secret of the Veda)."},{"pageNumber":1305,"pageContent":"Undated or Partly Dated Script, 1912–1913 1291 [2] There is no Script in this actually, it is only the record of thought vyakta or avyakta. Meanwhile the direct government has to begin; the slave to SriKrishna direct. Therefore the gods have stood back, but they are all present in the system. Tomorrow the direct government will be continuous. Tonight there will be the Ananda of the actual embrace of the daughters of delight. At present the conquest of the Akasha is the one necessity. Definitely, Ananda will take possession of the bodily system. The Arogyam will begin to take a definite trend towards finality. Ut- thapana will begin to recover force. No farther prophecies will be given about the third chatusthaya in the Script. [3] The physical resistance is successful because it is exhausting itself. The difficulty in the trikaldrishti is the principal obstacle to the perfection of the sruti, replacement of trikaldrishti by tejas & tapas. It is intended to give a greater rapidity to the siddhi, but the forces of resistance are hitherto successful. However, they will not be successful for much longer. In reality, sight is the proper method, aided by thought, & it is so being arranged, the old mental drishti will revive preparatory to the actual rupadrishti. The health is about to take a final decisive step forward, covering the only ground yet unoccupied. Ananda (physical, akarana) will now grow intense & possess the body. The daurbalyam will once more be expelled, entirely. Only the saundaryam will be still left effectively opposed though no longer contradicted. The opposition to the drishti in samadhi & jagrad goes trikaldrishti & siddhis establish themselves There is only difficulty of belief in the lila down here. That is about to be removed No writing this afternoon till teatime.

It will soon take a more powerful movement of knowledge & commence in action; necessarily, also in enjoyment. Today & not later the Ananda will begin. More force is needed. The normal writing must improve. Force cannot come, because the enemy makes use of it, not Indra, not Vritra, not even Pani, but the Rakshasa, Rakshaswi. Therefore only the calm stable or even regular force comes. But Rudrani needs a powerful and rushing force for her work, not merely a swift, even and unfailing force. It is this force which is in preparation. The physical weakness or brain arrest has nothing to do with it. The brain arrest comes because of the Rakshasic force and would be dispensed with if the stream of Rudranis activity were once liberated from this impediment and aggression. [4] Words, words, words, but no real brotherhood. They pass. Fake silver, mortofil, with bits of the real stuff & some psychic faculties such as all men can develop. Yes. For some time. We shall see. They are trying to keep down the system on the lower levels, but they cannot permanently succeed. Fresh siddhi today. Siddhi of trikaldrishti, aishwarya, ishita, vyapti, samadhi. There is excellent swapnasamadhi, but stability is insufficient. Yes, it is so intended to effect something by the script and immediately. Attend to the physical siddhi. The Arogya persists in spite of contradictions which are diminishing in force. Ananda has to be insisted on psychically till the body acquires it; it is not only willing, but eager to admit it, but the Vritras stand in the way. Saundarya will emerge in a few days. The personal relation has to be established. It has to be estab- lished by Vani, script, thought & action. The telepathy therefore can now be as much trusted as the nearer trikaldrishti.

But the success of these utthapanas depend[s] upon the anima & the anima on the ananda. Meanwhile the subjection to hunger craving & weakness of empti- ness is being removed. In fact, it is removed but the craving itself is still present in a modified form. Rupadrishti has not yet hold of the Akasha, but the time has now arrived. The vijnana has to become more active, with it the freedom of the rupa & lipi. I do not mean this very moment, nor do I mean that the vijnana is quiescent, but it has not recently been brilliantly active. The activity of chitrarupa is the sign, rather than the essential basis; it is if anything, a starting point. Chitra & sthapatya are linked together, they cannot be separated. The only question is about akasharupa & the method of bringing it about. When it was said that today there must be perfect activity, the relapse & revolt were not contemplated. None of those predictions have been falsified, except the filling in of the day with a perfect activity, & that did not refer to yesterday in particular. Nor did the other prediction mean that the continuity or abundance would be immediately perfect. The voices rejected are those that persist in misleading the mind by excessive encouragement. The lipi does not mean that there will be entire baldness, but that that is the price demanded. Let us leave these things & proceed with the positive siddhi. This is the command, be the results what they may. The superior strength of the aishwarya-ishita is now evident. There is no real need for the financial part of that letter. The Vanis have to be purified & the speech brought into stricter conformity with the Satya of Trikaldrishti. Continuity of the Ananda has first to be secured Taste is entirely perfect, but hearing, smell, sight & touch are still attacked by old sanskaras. You are right about the permitted obstinacy of the opposition. The vani is now purified. Both vani & script have to express a positive rather [than] a negative truth, but they have to possess the capacity of limiting the positive statement whenever necessary. The false or alien aishwarya has no longer any power. The indriyas will now be finally purified of Nirananda."},{"pageNumber":1309,"pageContent":"Undated or Partly Dated Script, 1912–1913 1295 Hearing first, then touch, then smell, last sight. The element of dis- comfort must be extruded, not suffered nirananda must become ananda, then intense ananda of bhoga. It is discomfort alone that survives. Reason has to disappear in truth. The persistence of the Ananda is now perfect; its continuity is assured but not perfect. The continuity has to become perfect. Afterwards the intensity will of itself increase. This is not indriya. It is manas in the physical prana. That cannot be purified all at once. Pain & discomfort of the body will therefore last, not in the indriyas, but this pain & discomfort must be increasingly associated with ananda, become a form of ananda & finally transmute into ananda. There is no other reaction except the pain in the fight & a slight subtle stiffness. These have to be steadily extruded. The difficulties of assimilation have to be faced & borne; a sudden resort to evacuation must always be avoided except in case of extreme urgency. A slow & steady development is still insisted on in the Sat of the apara prakriti & to that extent in the Sat of the Para Prakriti. It is evident that it is not intended immediately to succeed, but always now the aishwarya has an effect & usually an ultimate success, if it is persisted in and an ultimate effect, even if it is abandoned. Aishwarya now acts through direct pressure, through assistant circumstance in direct pressure & although it is not apparent by indirect action through Prakriti assisting these or by itself or using these. That is definite your steady tapas is the instrument faith will come with truth & success.

At the proper time your course will be justified by the event. When that time will come, is not yet clear, but it is not today or now. There is yet a delay before the bhagya can manifest. It is the crown & seal of the siddhi subject of course to farther development of both simultaneously. More of the trikaldrishti, aishwarya & ananda, also of the lipi. The exact trikaldrishti as yet fails to establish itself. That is what I insist on; the result you will see. You see. Tomorrow a great progress will be made as the result of todays struggle.

It is not tamasic. Today, then, the steady progress of vijnana & kamananda & the struggle in the health and the utthapana & saundarya. Leave that alone for the present; it is part of the karma. Still tejas has to increase & tapas & the force of the sraddha. It is the lack of the equipment that troubles & depresses the karma. Evidently the equipment is not yet due even that promise is not really fulfilled; only the absolute anxiety for the morrow is postponed. The cause of prospective anxiety must now be got rid of first.

The last day of this attack. The body will now be liberated. Once more the relics of the judgment & consideration have to be expelled by the dasyam.

Its accuracy has to be entirely proved, not only in what it says, but in what it suggests. The opposition need not trouble you.

There is no utility just now in overburdening the record. On the other hand much has to be written here. Some of the perceptions of the future have been confirmed, but there must be a freer movement. It is not my object to repeat here what the thought perception has given you. Meanwhile I give you some results. By Saturday physical siddhi in full train, but saundarya es- pecially not yet confirmed. By the 30 th all confirmed, but the saundarya still weak.

It will be seen how far the script is correct. Now for nearer predictions. First, the general utthapana is restored tonight & confirmed tomorrow. Study will be resumed, but not more than slightly. It will include Tamil & Hebrew. The line of progress of the three utthapanas will then be indicated.

The rest is well assured & will come easily when the difficulties have been overcome. 2 & 3 are somewhat developed, but the struggle in them continues. 1 is not at all devel- oped. It is really the sole thing that remains (except the saundarya). The doubt is stronger about saundarya and equipment than on any other point, & every suggestion of speedy improvement in these two matters is distrusted & repelled. It is towards this defect that the Shakti is now turning, as towards all other defects, but these must be overcome before the full flood of siddhi is possible. They must both begin to be overcome within this month of January & fully overcome in February. Vijnana has been checked. Only to show trikaldrishti at work and to insist on the continuous ac tion of the saundaryasiddhi. It is necessary to manifest the power of reading thoughts. It is al- ready manifesting, but must be habitual in its action & complete. This imagination must be expelled. There is no farther need of it. The idea of impossibility must be expelled. No, the siddhi is of chief importance. Yes, but the tendency is towards firmness & clearness. There is, undoubtedly, a defect in the present action of the vijnana & therefore of the script the defect of clouded prakasha. The devatas of intellectual tejas are yet too active in their shadows. The dasya is somewhat abridged owing to the revival of judgment & dissatisfaction which is for the rest, justified by event. It is suggested either today or tomorrow. The successful opposition to the vijnana siddhi & the physical siddhi is chiefly responsible. The rest would not have touched but for that. More deliberateness is needed without losing the rapidity. It must be so. Oppose the current no longer; even under the cloud, be sure of the sun behind. There is still an elusive activity seeking to arrange the thoughts. The arrangement must emerge of itself. There is a spirit of judgment waiting on script & thought which hampers the flow of the vijnana. This spirit of judgment has to be expelled. It waits also on the action & hampers it.

The movement is now for the dasyam on the widest scale. In the trikaldrishti the doubt of the exactness is still active, based on past experience. This is to be removed by the growth & dominance of the ritam. Vijnana led by mahat [7] The assault is being given to the bhukti, tejas and faith. The samata has not been disturbed, only the hasyam has felt a cloud pass over it. The tejas & faith have been darkened for a moment; they subsist but have lost their ananda. Only the vijnana has been clouded and the positive bhukti suspended. That is over. We will now continue developing automatically the vijnana & the bhukti. You have to wait & see. There is as yet no advance, only a taking up of positions. Nothing has been done which is not old & familiar & the balance of success is still on the side of the attack. That will change in & from the next half hour. It is already changing. Enough. Two chatusthayas have been almost perfected & at any rate secured against real disturbance and above all against any contin- uous breach.

There are touches,"},{"pageNumber":1317,"pageContent":"Undated or Partly Dated Script, 1912–1913 1303 not breaches. . The actuality in the third is being extended. But the Vritra has not yet been abolished. In the first two it is not the Vritra, but the vrika except in the attahasya, brihat faith & ishwarabhava. Today is for the third chatusthaya & especially for knowledge & power, knowledge most, power secondarily. Lipi ac- companies them. Samadhi & rupa follow. The development today will be decisive. Only in the fourth & fifth, there is still delay. I do not mean it will be at once perfect. Obviously this is not the direct script. These are not gods, but spirits who seek to guide, inform, direct. Only it is not true that the script is governed by them & never expressed a higher power & knowledge. It is not now being used by a spirit, but merely besieged by a spirit. It is I who am using it & me you know. Not Indra or another but the Master of the Yoga. It is not the divine script because it is acting through mind, not direct from Vijnana. It will always act from Vijnana. I am about to establish with fixity the personal relation. The rest is there. All these minor bhavas have to be expelled. The end of the opposition is near in the third. It is really over in the trikaldrishti. It must be finished with in the lipi, rupa & samadhi. The one thing really that remains is rupa samadhi. There is a confusion, the incompetent devatas have to be expelled. It is true more was expected or demanded by one side of the mind than has been fulfilled, more accomplished than was expected by the inert, sceptical side. Perfection is not for today. The second chatusthaya is different. The faith, aishwarya, attahasya have been interrupted All the vijnana is definitely in action, though in unequal & imperfect action. The unequal & imperfect parts must now be filled in & out. Afterwards we can attend to the fourth chatusthaya more particularly. We have to move forward. Recognise the nature of existence. This is the knowledge; therefore dhairya is necessary. No dependence on the script. If it depends on the script, it will not be self-assured. The script is only for confirmation. It is perfectly true that the first chatusthay has been broken into after"},{"pageNumber":1318,"pageContent":"1304 Record of Yoga a promise that it should never again be broken. . Substantially it is intact. The violence done to the system is the proof that it cannot be destroyed. The continuance of the tejas will be the proof that the second chatusthay stands, even in the faith there is only a temporary disturbance. The harm done will be repaired. The promises have all been exaggerations of Will, therefore lies. The Vani has exag- gerated, every source of knowledge has exaggerated. The inertia exaggerates on the opposite side. So much has been done. All that was a play of the game intended to bring about a fresh grouping. Henceforth all the move- ments of knowledge & power will work themselves out not inter- fered with by the will in the intellect & the intellectual judgment, although these in their passing rupam can still distort the truth. [8] Shrink not nor falter, O hero, though thy toil seems ever to return on thee in vain menacing to crush thee in its rebound. Thy labour of Sisyphus is the laboratory of the future & the fulfilment of eternity is in thy present insignificant toil, as the tree that was & is to be in the seed that seems so little to the eye & vain. [9] The recurring confusion created by the pranic intellect intrud- ing its activity is forced on the system, but it is noticeable that only the shadow of asamata & ashakti comes with it as a part of the ajnana & disappear[s] automatically with the return of the jnana. The apparent difficulty will disappear like all the rest. The pressure on the tejas is intended to force the emergence of the rapidly fulfilling divine tapas. Trust first, if there is anything wrong, seek the explanation or better await it. Rapidity is necessary first in the third chatusthaya & in the fourth; there will be sufficient money to keep you till January. The ecstasy is to increase in force & frequency, while the subdued (not the obstructed) ananda becomes perpetual during"},{"pageNumber":1319,"pageContent":"Undated or Partly Dated Script, 1912–1913 1305 waking hours & even in sleep the ananda gains ground. Then the subdued ecstasy will take its place while intense ecstasy becomes the occasional higher state. So it will proceed. As for the siddhi of the health, that proceeds in spite of all resistance. Neither of these will be perfect till December; but meanwhile the utthapana will come rapidly forward & the saundarya begin to break through its obstacles. The range must be widened & the defects removed The gen- eral obstruction must be met by a general denial of the obstruction & refusal to work out of it by the lower processes. That has been done sufficiently and has not to be repeated ad infinitum There is now no reason why the Samata etc should disappear. Only the tejas of Mahakali must finally be harmonised with the passivity and the dasya. This will be done today by eliminating the Maheshwari bhava from the superficial consciousness & its con- tents without bringing back the mental tejas. It is true. Nevertheless these things are done. The struggle is over the whole basis of the farther advance. The incident of yesterday was used as a turning point to turn you into the road hitherto avoided, now destined for your treading, the road of mighty, straightforward effective karma. Others have tried, stumbled and fallen. You will see that you are henceforth as effectively protected in action as in self-defensive passivity & in action by others as effectually & more. All these mishaps have had their object and their beneficial purposefulness. Not after this year. The knowledge & power have to be entirely harmonised first. That egoism is exhausting its remnants. The difficulty is great only because the pranic suggestions attempt to predominate & mislead; in itself it is not great. Today a great movement forward. It is not forbidden; it has to be accepted; it will clear itself of the ignorance, which is now the only obstacle. Today for the second & third if the second is cleared, the first automatically fulfils itself. There is a tremendous"},{"pageNumber":1320,"pageContent":"1306 Record of Yoga pressure in order to compel the buddhi to give up faith in the bodily siddhi & the new society. Let the power first be reestablished. The trikaldrishti, telepathy, power, lipi have now all to move towards absolute perfection dragging the samadhi & drishti with them. Till that is done, the fourth chatusthaya will only prepare its ad- vance. The advance has begun; it will gather momentum during the day. The powers of knowledge & tapas are stronger, but they are all acting in the intellect without the action of the intellectual judgment, therefore there is no light. The mental realm is being purified of the pranas. The force of the tapas is yet insufficient. Life has to be brought into line with the siddhis acquired, or in other words the powers have to take hold of life and possess it. Life means the Akash of the prithivi, & through the Akash all it contains. It is true, the Akash is full of opposition & obstruction where formerly it seemed clear. The obstruction is only in order to bring out the samata, tapas etc & increase the eventual force of the powers themselves. The admission of the power & right of the objective world to resist is to be once more cancelled. So far we have advanced that the power & knowledge are showing the old force & invariable effectiveness, but the effectiveness is usually partial, often slight in actuality, seldom flawless. We have not then advanced beyond the old point in appearance, except that the power & the instruments are all accepted & faith in them is completely founded, though still uncertain about rapid results. The second chatusthaya is now completely founded except in the extent & certainty in detail of the faith & of the Kalibhava, therefore the attahasya too is little manifest. That must now appear, while at the same time the instruments of the later chatusthayas farther justify themselves. The conditions are now fixed and will clear & develop themselves The third chatusthaya is reforming itself on a much sounder basis. The power, lipi & knowledge will during the next three days overpower the resistance of the physical akasha. Rupa and samadhi will follow their lead.

Experienced, Dec 14 & 15th 1913. There are Powers of pure mind which are indifferent, equal to all things, as in possession of the samata, but they are void of active delight; they do not press out the wine of immortal delight, they possess man in that state when, his hopes oppressed, he takes refuge in a passive & equal indifference, and is no longer in love with mental activities. In this state man takes this enemy of Indra & of his own perfection as a friend and helper. Mental force becoming entirely luminous in knowledge, s ́ urih, is to pierce this dangerous disguise & make clear to the inner eye the true nature of this harmful agency, sama indeed, but asunvan, sama because dunasha & not because of equal delight. He is to be slain in the pure mind where he dwells by Indra in the form of the thunderbolt, mind force informed with vaidyuta energy from Mayas. A uhate is proleptic; the result of Indra or mind force becoming entirely luminous with the solar light of the ideal knowledge is to perfect the mental power of the Yogin so that he is 1 MS 173"},{"pageNumber":1334,"pageContent":"1320 Record of Yoga strong to support & hold all the activities of mental knowledge & of the temperament in their fullness. “Be rapturous in us and a dwelling for the sacrifice, enter with mastery into Indra, O Soma; thou art powerful, moving forward, and thou meetest no hostile forces on thy way.

We shall see how the thought of God works itself out in Life. The material world is first formed with the Sun as centre, the Sun [ ] 1 being itself only a subordinate star of the great Agni, Mahavishnu, in whom is centred the Bhu. Mahavishnu is the Virat Purusha who as Agni pours Himself out into the forms of sun and star. He is Agni Twasht ́ a, Visvakarman, he is also Praj ́ apati and Matariswan. These are the three primal Purushas of the earth life, Agni Twashta, Praj ́ apati & Matariswan, all of them soul bodies of Mahavishnu. Agni Twashta having made the Sun out of the Apas or waters of being, Prajapati as Surya Savitri enters into the Sun and takes possession of it. He multiplies himself in the Suris or Solar Gods who are the souls of the flames of Surya, the Purushas of the female solar energies. Then he creates out of this solar body of Vishnu the planets each of which successively becomes the Bhumi or place of manifestation for Manu, the mental being, who is the nodus of manifest life-existence and the link between the life and the spirit. The present earth in its turn appears as the scene of life, Mars being its last theatre. In the Bhumi Agni Twashta is again the first principle, Matariswan the second, finally, Prajapati appears in the form of the four Manus, chatv ́ aro manavah. Not in the physical world at first, but in the mental world which stands behind the earth-life; for earth has seven planes of being, the material of which the scenes and events are alone normally visible to the material senses, the vital of which mans pranakosha is built and to which it is responsive, the mental to which his manahkosha is attached, the ideal governing his vijnanakosha, the beatific which supports his anandakosha, & the dynamic and essential to which he has not 1 MS itself"},{"pageNumber":1338,"pageContent":"1324 Record of Yoga yet developed corresponding koshas, but only unformed nimbuses of concrete being. All the gods throw out their linga-rupas into these worlds of earth and through them carry on her affairs; for these lingas repeat there in the proper terms of life upon earth the conscious movements of the gods in their higher existences in the worlds above Bhu. The Manus manifested in the Manoloka of Bhu bring pressure to bear upon the earth for the manifestation of life and mind. Prajapati as Rudra then begins to form life upon earth, first in vegetable, then in animal forms. Man already exists but as a god or demigod in Bhuvarloka of Bhu, not as a man upon earth. There he is Deva, Asura, Rakshasa, Pramatha, Pisacha, Pashu or as Deva he is either Gandharva[,] Yaksha, Vidyadhara or any of the Karmadevas. For Man is a son of the Manu and is assigned his place in Div & Pradiv, in Heaven & in the Swargabhumis. Thence he descends to earth and thither from earth he returns. All that will be explained afterwards. When the human body is ready, then he descends upon earth and occupies it. He is not a native of earth, nor does he evolve out of the animal. His manifestation in animal form is always a partial incarnation, as will be seen hereafter. The animal proper is a lower type. Certain devas of the manasic plane in the Bhuvarloka descend in the higher type of animal. They are not mental beings proper, but only half-mental vital beings. They live in packs, tribes etc with a communal existence. They are individual souls, but the individuality is less vigorous than the type soul. If they were not individual, they would not be able to incarnate in individual forms. The body is onl y the physical type of the soul. The soul, if it were only a communal soul, would manifest in some complex body of which the conglomeration of the different parts would be the sole unity; say, a life like that of the human brain. The animal develops the tribe life, the pack or clan life, the family life. He develops chitta, manas, the rudiments of reason. Then only man appears. How does he appear? Prajapati manifests as Vishnu Upendra incarnate in the animal or Pashu in whom the four Manus have already manifested themselves, and the first human creature who appears is, in this Kalpa, the Vanara, not the animal Ape, but man with the Ape nature.

The animal forms a perfect type for the human Pashu and then only a Manuputra or Manu, a human, a true mental soul, enters into existence upon earth, with the full blaze of a perfect animal-human mentality in the animal form. These are mans beginnings. He rises by the descent of ever higher types of Manu from the Bhuvarloka, first he is Pashu, then Pishacha, then Pramatha, then Rakshasa, then Asura, then Deva, then Siddha. So he ascends the ladder of his own being towards the Sat Purusha. Manu, the first Prajapati, is a part of Mahavishnu Himself descended into the mental plane in order to conduct the destinies of the human race. He is different from the four Manus who are more than Prajapatis, they being the four Type-Souls from whom all human Purushas are born; they are Manus only for the purpose of humanity & in themselves are beyond this manifest universe & dwell for ever in the being of the Para Purushas. They are not true Manomaya Purushas. But Manu Prajapati is a true manomaya Purusha. He by mental generation begets on his female Energies men in the mental & vital planes above earth, whence they descend into the material or rather the terrestrial body. On earth Manu incarnates fourteen times in each Kalpa & each of these fourteen incarnations is called a Manu. These fourteen Manus govern human destinies during the hundred chaturyugas of the Prati-Kalpa, each in turn taking charge of a particular stage of the human advance. While that stage lasts he directs it both from the mental world and by repeated incarnations upon earth. When Manu Prajapati wishes to incarnate in a fresh form, he has a mental body prepared for him by evolution of births by a human vibhuti, Suratha or another & takes possession of it at the beginning of his manvantara. Each manvantara is composed of a varying number of chaturyugas according to the importance & difficulty of the stage with which it is concerned. Once at least in each chaturyuga the Manu of the Manvantara incarnates as a man upon earth, but this never happens in the Kali Yuga. The seventh & eighth Manus are the most important in each Prati Kalpa & have the longest reigns, for in their Manvantaras the critical change is finally made from the"},{"pageNumber":1340,"pageContent":"1326 Record of Yoga type which was completed in the last Prati Kalpa to the type which is to be perfected in the present Kalpa. For each of the ten Prati- Kalpas has its type. Man in the ten Prati-Kalpas progresses through the ten types which have been fixed for his evolution in the Kalpa. In this Kalpa the types, dashagu, are the ten forms of consciousness, called the Pashu, Vanara, Pishacha, Pramatha, Rakshasa, Asura, Deva, Sadhyadeva, Siddhadeva and the Satyadeva. The last three are known by other names which need not be written at present. The Pashu is mind concentrated entirely on the annam, the Vanara mind concentrated on the Prana, the Pishacha mind concentrated on the senses & the knowledge part of the chitta, the Pramatha mind concentrated on the heart & the emotional & aesthetic part of the chitta, the Rakshasa is mind concentrated on the thinking manas proper & taking up all the others into the manas itself; the Asura is mind concentrated on the buddhi & in the Asura Rakshasa making it serve the manas & chitta; the Deva is mind concentrated in vijnanam, exceeding itself, but in the Asura Deva or Devasura it makes the vijnana serve the buddhi. The others raise mind successively to the Ananda, Tapas & Sat & are, respectively, the supreme Rakshasa, the supreme Asura, the supreme Deva. We have here the complete scale by which Mind ascends its own ladder from Matter to pure Being evolved by Man in the various types of which each of the ten principles is in its turn capable. To take the joy of these various types in their multifold play is the object of the Supreme Purusha in the human Lila. [II] A series of images and a number of intimations have been given yesterday in the chitra-drishti to illustrate the history of the first two Manwantaras & the vicissitudes through which the human idea has gone in the course of these unnumbered ages. It is not at all surprising that there should be no relics of those vicissitudes in the strata of the present earth; for the present earth is not the soil of the planet as it was in the earliest Manwantaras.

It is unnecessary to go at present into the scene or habitat of the incidents & peoples shown in the drishti. The facts are sufficient. 2 The first image was that of a young & beautiful woman fleeing, holding two children by either hand, preceded by a third though this was not clearly seen and followed by a little child, a girl with her cloth in her hand. All are of the female sex. In their flight they have upset a handsome & well-dressed young man, who was also fleeing across the line of their flight and now lies sprawling on his back. Behind the woman & her girls an elderly & bearded savage, naked & armed with some kind of weapon, runs at a distance of not many yards and but for the accident of the upset would soon overtake the fugitives. The second image showed the young man still supine with the savage upon him threatening him fiercely with his weapon, but the bhava shows that not slaughter, but prisoners & slaves are the object of the raid. The young man is evidently taken prisoner by the pursuer who has turned aside from the women to this, possibly, more valuable booty. In the third image the little girl of the first is seen captured by a young & handsome barbarian who has managed to comfort and soothe her & is persuading her to lead him to the secret refuge of the fugitives. By this device, it is now indicated, he is able to discover this refuge & capture the whole colony of the civilised people. The success raises him to the rank of a great chief among his people, for it is his section of the raiders who make the victory really profitable. The chitra-lipi Indigenous just given shows that these barbarians are the original inhabitants of the country, the others colonists & conquerors. It is intimated by the vijnana that both assailants & assailed are in the Pashu stage & people of the first or second Manu, but the civilised have reached a kind of Devahood of the Gandharva type, the savages are a reappearance of the Asura Rakshasa type of Pashu brought back into a more advanced age in order to re-invigorate the over-refined type that has been evolved.

He takes the lead of their revolt which is at first a disordered movement of indigna- tion (lipi Indignation alternating with indigenous)[,] systematises it, conquers & enslaves the Gandharvas, learns from them their civilisation and modifies it by the barbarian manners. The new race evolved finally dominates the then world & fixes the next type of the Pashu evolution. But who are these Pashus? For this is not the first pratikalpa of the Pashus, but the sixth of the Asuras, and it is indicated that none of these visions belong to any other pratikalpa than the present. It follows that even these savages cannot be pure Pashus, but Asuras or Asura Rakshasas starting from the Pashu stage, so far as the Asura can go back to that stage, and fulfilling the possibilities of a sort of Pashu-Asura before evolving his Asurahood in the higher types & arriving & shooting beyond the pure Asura. This is an important modification. It follows that each type of the Dasha- gavas goes, within the mould of his own type, through all the ten g ́ avas from the Pashu to the Siddhadeva. The Pashu-Asura will be different from the pure Pashu or the Pashu Deva, because he will always be first & characteristically an Asura, but he will weigh from the buddhi on the bodily experiences as Pashu, on the vijnana experiences as Deva & so in each type according to its particular field of activity. The Deva will do it, instead, from the vijnana, & the difference of leverage & point of action will make an immense difference both to the character of the activity and its results in the field. Moreover it is clear that the Pashu Asura goes also through the various types within his mixed Pashuhood & Asurahood be- fore he passes to the Pisacha-Asura, who has to undergo a similar development. The great variety of types that will result from this evolutionary system, is evident. The farther images seen 3 in connection with this Pashu-Asura episode are three in number. First the plain & desolate country with a hill in the distance, about which it is indicated by the vijnana that this was the appearance of the country not actually occupied by the 3 These three images (along with a fourth) are mentioned in the Record of 23 March 1914; see page 397.

The catastrophe came because of their haste to conquer the whole small continent before they were able to people all the unoccupied land & build themselves into a strong & irresistible power organised in great cities & populous nations. This haste was due to the superior fertility & attractiveness of the soil actually occupied by the barbarians who, being poor agricultural- ists, had settled only on rich soil not demanding a skilful labour & left the rest untilled. The contrast between the waterless soil first seen & the banks of the great river on which was the barbarian settlement, is typical of the contrast between the two kinds of soil, utilised & unutilised. The premature attempts at conquest began with aggressions on the nearest barbarian villages & the raid seen was the first effective retaliation carried out in the absence of the fighting men of the colony, so that on the side of the attacked only women, children & peaceful unarmed men are seen fleeing to a habitual & secret place of refuge. For this colony was on the very borders of the barbarian country & always exposed to incursions. It is not clear why the colonist fighters were absent, whether on a raid on the barbarians or in a civil quarrel among themselves. The second image, the fortified city on the plateau, shown by the terraces cut in the slope of the plateau & the subsequent separate chitra of one of the city domes, to be a civilised & mag- nificent metropolis, shows the final result of the amalgamation of barbarians & colonists. The original barbarian settlement was on the bank of the great river seen with one of its ghauts not far from the foot of the plateau, but after the raid, in order to safeguard themselves & their booty, the savages retreated at the instance of the young victorious chief, now by common consent their leader, to the plateau, then steep in its slope & difficult of access. Afterwards a great city was built on the site of this barbarian stronghold. The construction on the river in appearance like a house, but apparently standing on the water can have been nothing but a houseboat or rather a house-raft, & it is moored to a char in the river, a fact which suggested the first erroneous idea that it was a house on an island in the river."},{"pageNumber":1344,"pageContent":"1330 Record of Yoga The third image, the large, high & spacious hut, built almost with elegance & with the great wide open door, was that of the chief and shows that the savages, in spite of their nakedness, were not on the lowest scale either of human immaturity or of human degeneration. The figure in clerical dress & hat is that not of a priest, but of an envoy, one of the elders of the colony come to negotiate for the restoration of the captives; the girl with whom he converses & from whom he turns in shocked despair, is one of the daughters of the woman seen in the earliest of this series of images, now a slave & concubine of the chief. At first, the colonists were unwilling to use violence lest the captives should be maltreated. The fact that one of the most important of them has already been subjected to irremediable indignity, has just come to the knowledge of the elder along with other facts, eg the unwillingness of the chiefs to make any reparation, & accounts for the action which indicates despair of peace or any fruitful negotiation. The series is not yet complete, but awaits the unfolding of farther events already very vaguely indicated by the vijnana. The other image has no connection with these events but belongs to a later Manvantara, that of the Pramatha-Rakshasa, of the sixth Manu in one of its most perfect & brilliant stages. It has to be kept vivid in the mind for future interpretation. III The disposition of the Manwantaras may now be described. It will be remembered that there are fourteen Manus and ten gavas of the Dashagava. How are these divided among the Manus? In this Kalpa or rather Pratikalpa the type Pashu is the Vanara, but as in all Natures movements, even in manifesting the Vanara, the others first make their appearance rapidly before the type “arrives”; those most germane to the matter are the lion, tiger, elephant, dog, wolf, cat, bull & cow, bear, fox, ass, horse, bee, ant, butterfly, fish, eagle (also kite, hawk & vulture), songbird, crow & cuckoo etc. In all these human egos readily incarnate & the human type absorbs them all. The first Manu takes all these totems & applies them to the general type of the Asura, driving at the evolution of a giant Vanara- Asura who has in him all these elements & combines them into an"},{"pageNumber":1345,"pageContent":"Notes on Images Seen in March 1914 1331 animal harmony dominated by curiosity, humour, adaptability & adaptiveness, the Ape virtues which bring that type nearest to man. This Vanara Asura the first Manu hands on to the second, who takes the type, fulfils it and evolves it into the Pishacha-Asura. This he does by bringing the Ape curiosity uppermost and applying it to all the experiences of mans animal life, to play, work, domestic- ity, battle, pleasure, pain, laughter, grief, relations, arrangements etc. All the higher qualities imagination, reflection, invention, thought, spirituality even are turned towards these experiences & their possibilities, cognitional not aesthetic exhausted so far as the human animal can exhaust them. This however, is done only in the third Manwantara. In the second it is the Vanara who satisfies his humour, curiosity & adaptiveness in a far more elementary & summary fashion, but as he does so, he begins to refine & evolve in search of new sensations until the full Pisacha Asura is born. This type is handed over to the third Manu to fulfil, & to it two Manvantaras are devoted, in the third the Pisacho-Pramatha of the Asura type evolves; in the fourth the Pisacha Pramatha evolves into the full Pramatha-Asura. The curiosity ceases to be merely cognitional & practically scientific, it becomes aesthetic with an animal & vital aestheticism; the Pramatha seeks to extract their full emotional & aesthetic values, their full rasa out of everything in life, out of torture equally with ecstasy, death equally with life, grief equally with joy. That type is evolved by the fifth Manu into the Pramatha-Rakshasa of the Asura type, & by the sixth into the full Rakshasa-Asura. The Rakshasa it is who first begins really to think, but his thought is also egoistic & turned towards sensation. What he seeks is a gross egoistic satisfaction in all the life of the mind, prana & body, in all the experiences of the Pashu, Pisacha, Pramatha & his own. But as this type is not a pure Rakshasa, but a Rakshasasura, the thought is there from the beginning, for the Rakshasa has already established it in the human mould in the fifth pratikalpa. It now, however, in the Asura ceases to be subservient to the vital & animal instincts & becomes the instrument instead of a vigorous, violent & clamorous intellectual ego. As the main type is that of the Asura, there is always a tendency to subordinate the lower ego to the intellectual Aham, but the subordination is at"},{"pageNumber":1346,"pageContent":"1332 Record of Yoga first only a self-disciplining for a more intelligently victorious self- indulgence, like the tapasya of Ravana. This type evolved is fixed in the character of Ravana and takes possession of its field in the Manwantara of the seventh Manu, Vaivasvata. In that Manwantara it evolves into the Asuro-Rakshasa in which the intellectual ego & the emotional, sensational ego enter into an equal copartnership for the grand enthronement & fulfilment of the human ahankara. As the type of the sensational & emotional Rakshasa-Asura is Ravana, so the type of the more mightily balanced Asura Rakshasa of the Asura type is Hiranyakashipu. In the eighth Manwantara this Asura Rakshasa evolves into the pure Asura who serves his intellectual ego & subordinates to it all the other faculties. That type reigns with the ninth Manu & evolves into the Asuradeva of the Asura mould & in the tenth Manvantara into the Devasura who enthrones the vijnana and glorifies the Asura existence by the vijnanamaya illuminations playing on the whole of the triple mental[,] vital & bodily life of man. In the eleventh & twelfth manwantaras the Devasura evolves into the Sadhya, the Anandamaya Asura who at first with the pure Ananda, then with the Tapomaya Ananda, then with the Sanmaya Ananda dominates the reigns of the thirteenth & fourteenth Manus & completes the apotheosis of the Asura in man. With the Siddhadeva in the Asura the hundredth Chaturyuga of the sixth Pratikalpa comes to a glorious close. IV. Certain farther images have appeared which seem intended to show the nature of the Kaliyuga civilisation evolved by the inter- mixture of the barbarian & the Gandharva Pashus. 4 One is that of a very wide road climbing up a steep incline; the comparative height of the trees on one side show its great width. This picture seems to be intended to confirm the impression created by the ensemble of the city on the plateau, by the dome & by another chitra of a part of the hill with a (private?) house roofed like a modern church, that this civilisation had a certain bigness, massiveness & sharply cut variety. A low type of the Pashu in this age was also seen, 4 These images are mentioned, in a different order, in the Record of 24 March 1914; see pages 403-4. Ed."},{"pageNumber":1347,"pageContent":"Notes on Images Seen in March 1914 1333 bearded, [hatted] 5 & visaged like a lowclass modern American of the West. These resemblances have created some doubt as to either the genuineness of these images or their right interpretation; but the doubt is not justified by its cause. For throughout the four- teen Manwantaras, variations, permutations & combinations of the same type are bound to appear. This is the law of Natures development in clay, plant & animal & applies equally to man, his manners, ideas, appurtenances & institutions. Given the truth of the Manwantara theory any other feature than this varied repetition would be more surprising than the repetition itself & lead to more legitimate distrust. There are plenty of variations & signs of imma- turity or different tendency. In the image of the river, it is noticeable that there are no modern vessels. The houseboat is a houseraft & entirely different in structure from the modern houseboat; the craft in which the man & girl in another image are seen crossing the river is also a raft & not a boat. The Gandharvas, when first seen, are robed differently in the males & the women; the former have dresses like the older styles of European dress, the latter wear loose & light classical draperies an arrangement which is after all sufficiently natural & might easily evolve in an artistic & aesthetically minded race. The Teutonic element in the character & civilisation of the new type Pashus is a result of the blending of the graceful, slight & artistic Gandharva with the plain, forceful & robust barbarian; the latter predominates in the blend & the former merely tones down his force & gives a few details of dress & manners much modified in the direction of rude & clear cut plainness & strength, & is chiefly prominent but not predominant in the women as typified by the girl on the raft who has a native grace denied to the men of her blood. Their elegance is heavy & artificial, worn as a dress rather than possessed as a native characteristic. Sometimes the type goes very low as in the premature American; the ordinary type is higher but void of dignity or greatness, grace or beauty. They represent an early tendency towards the Asura Rakshasa such as he manifests himself in the Kaliyugas of this Pratikalpa when he has compassed the first heavy self-restraint necessary for his evolution towards the 5 MS hated"},{"pageNumber":1348,"pageContent":"1334 Record of Yoga Deva. In a later image the woman of the first, the captive of the barbarian Augustus, is seen in a later incarnation at the turning point when this type dissatisfied with itself is trying to recover the grace, humour, artistry, fantasy, liveliness of their Gandharva blood, so as to develop again in themselves the Pashu deva. This fixes the period of these incidents. It is in the Kali of the fourth chaturyuga in the reign of the first Manu when the Rakshasa Asura of the Pashu Asura type reigns & is attempting to turn full Asura with occasional overshootings to the Pashu deva. Every race that thus overshoots its mark & goes a step farther than their immediate next pace in evolution aids powerfully that evolution, but becomes unfit for survival & has to disappear. For this reason the Gandharva race of the Pashus disappeared & the Asura Rakshasa type reappeared, then took up something of the Gandharva & advanced one step towards the Asura-Pashu of the Asura type. By such overleapings & recoilings human evolution has always advanced. V. There are certain images of animals dating from these early aeons which should be recorded here although they are not of the first Pashu period but fall before & after it. 6 The first are images of a monstrous creature resembling the modern seal, but thicker & bulkier seen in a region of ice; the other another animal of equally monstrous bulk, its skin a series of successive red and yellow bands, its face exceedingly long, rough, thin & snouted, a cross between bear, wolf & tiger in the face, rhinoceroslike, yet supple in the body, but in spite of its ferocious appearance, sufficiently harmless. These creatures, it is suggested in the vijnana, belong to the first chaturyuga of the pratikalpa previous to the appearance of man; for the fourteen Manus enjoy each a reign of seven chaturyugas of varying lengths and the first & last of the hundred belong not to any Manu but the opening chaturyuga to Brahma & Rudra, the closing to Kalki & to Shiva. Man in the first appears only tentatively at the end, in the last only as a survival at the beginning. The third image is that of a bear leaping on a smaller animal which it keeps under its paw while it wrests from it & devours some 6 These images are mentioned in the Record of 24 March 1914; see page 404.

It is a small deer, only one third the size of the modern fallow deer. Suddenly the head of the bear sinks. It has been killed, it would seem, by the arrow, spear or other weapon of a human hunter. This scene belongs to the second Manwantara of the Vanaras. 7 A fourth image is of a horse of the first Manwantara in one of its earlier chaturyugas, a clumsy stiff-legged & long-eared animal squarish in its lines & most unlike the graceful modern equine species. The animal stands on the side of a river, & with head raised & stretched sideways & ears pricked, listens to a sound amid the trees on the opposite bank. This image was preceded by another of a horse of the Pashu period in the later age when the civilised barbarian type was trying to recover the Gandharva. This type of horse, standing with a rider on its back & other human beings conversing near & at its head, is more equine, but is still stiff-legged & has not lost the asinine cast of head of its predecessor. VI. Three images of the fourth in descent from the Chief of the Barbarians; the first showing him standing meditating on the great ghaut of the river, a figure & face like Napoleons clad in a dress resembling the modern European; the second, his mother & step- mother, descendants of the captives of the first image; the third, the emperor again with his halfbrother, irreproachably clad, Prefect of the city, consulting with regard to some palace intrigue in which the mother & stepmother are concerned. 8 It is intimated that it is this fourth King of the line who establishes the dominance of the race in the then earth. 7 This image is mentioned in the Record of 25 March 1914; see page 407.

When the hidden secret has been discovered and made effec- tive, the human consciousness will be exceeded, the superconscient made conscient and the subconscient or inconscient which is the inevitable shadow of the superconscient filled with the true spiritual and supramental consciousness.

The knowledge or idea with which it was begun was imper- fect and not applicable under the present circumstances. In reality what was chiefly relied upon was a great dynamic energy and the power of the will and aspiration to bring the divine realisation into the body. These forces can do miracles under the right condi- tions; and now they are quite strong enough to produce miraculous results on the subjective plane, in the physical consciousness, the physical mind and the vital physical, but the most material is not yet ready. The attempt was therefore premature. In order that it should succeed, one of two things was necessary, either a right entire knowledge and process or else the divine Grace supporting a complete descent of the highest supramental Truth and a complete ascent to meet it of the supramental from below. These things should have been got first and firmly founded, for till then there can be no effective divinisation of the material body. 2. The entire giving up of food cannot be the condition of the realisation; it must be, if it is to be done, one result or circumstance of the realisation. 3 It is a mistake to think that cessation of hunger, a sensation of being fed or the refusal of food by the body is a sign that the material frame is ready for living without sustenance. Hunger and the rest come from the vital in the body. It was this bodily vital which was ready and desirous of abstaining from food, but the most material parts were not ready. But being without a voice and accustomed to obey and act only as an instrument, they gave no sign except the fading of the flesh and physical weakness. Now this material part is most important and indispensable. It is the earth herself in the concrete. It is part of the crude stuff you have to use for building the divine physical substance and you cannot do without it. Therefore it must be respected and not forced before it is ready. It has to be mastered and transformed, but not done violence to or neglected. 4.

Four physical things have to be attained; stability and conti- nuity of consciousness, stability and continuity of energy, stability and continuity of Ananda, stability and continuity of substance. The first she has gained; it gives a certain mukti, liberation, conscious immortality, and can give great results, but not by itself the complete result aimed at. The second is beginning to come, but as it brings you a step nearer to the completeness, it is itself also more dependent than the first on its instrument, the body. It can exist in itself, but for its completeness it must become an entirely physical and material strength, for which there should be as a tool a strong body. The other two stabilities and especially the last are still unattained. The last is the most difficult of all; it is the greatest achievement, the one problem that really has yet to be solved and on which the terrestrial security of the others depends. My advice to you is not to mind retracing your steps; she should take food again and build up the body again as a necessary support. At the same time as a general rule try to use the food to the best advantage by concentration upon it and upon the bodys reception of it and its right assimilation so that finally the body can maintain itself in full force and substance with a minimum quantity of stuff, a supreme quality and a maximum of assimilation. When that has been attained, the necessary adaptation will have neared completion. Advance progressively at first; rapidity will be possible afterwards. Do not mind the initial difficulties. Remember however that the food problem is only a detail and do not exaggerate its importance. The main thing is to bring down and up the highest supramental from above and the deepest from below, to unite them and to obtain the support, sanction and constant effectuating action of what you call the divine Grace which is a descent from the Truth of the Supreme determining all from the plenitude of the Eternal.

People begin with the body and the prana, go on to the chitta and the manas, and finish up with the buddhi and the will. The real course is to start with the will and finish with the body. There is no need of Asana, Pranayama, Kumbhaka, Chittasuddhi, or anything else preparatory or preliminary if one starts with the will. That was what Sri Rama- krishna came to show so far as Yoga is concerned. “Do the Shakti Upasana first,” he said, “get Shakti and she will give you Sat.” Will and Shakti are the first means necessary to the Yogin. That was why he said always, “Remember you are Brahman,” and he gave that as a central message to Swami Vivekananda. You are Ishwara. If you choose, you can be shuddha, siddha and everything else, or, if you choose, you can be just the opposite. The first necessity is to believe in yourself, the second in God and the third to believe in Kali; for these things make up the world. Educate the Will first, through the Will educate the Jnanam, through the Jnanam purify the Chitta, control the Prana and calm the Manas. Through all these instruments immortalise the body. That is the real yoga, the Mahapantha, that is the true and only Tantra. The Vedanta starts with Buddhi, the Tantra with Shakti. What the Will is you have heard. It is Shakti, it is not Vasana, it is not Cheshta. Vasana and Cheshta are the negation of will. If you have desire, that means you doubt the power of your Will. Brahman has no desire. He wills and all things happen according to his Will. If you have Cheshta, that means you doubt your Will. Only those who feel or think they are not strong, struggle and"},{"pageNumber":1386,"pageContent":"1372 Record of Yoga labour to produce an effect. Brahman has no cheshta. He wills and His Will spontaneously produces its effect. But it produces it in time, space and causality. To demand a result now here and under given conditions is Ajnanam. The time, space and causality of every event and its development have been fixed ages ago by yourself and Parameswara, when the Kalpa began. It is ignorance to struggle and try to alter what you have yourself decreed. Care not about time, space or conditions, but will, and leave the result to God who is your omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient self. You are the individual God and He is the universal God. Nothing but God exists. Ekam evadwitiyam. Therefore Will implies Samata, absence of Vasana and Cheshta. Absence of Vasana and Cheshta implies knowledge. Until you have knowledge, you can never be safe against the return of Vasana and Cheshta. The question is how to start. The Shakti is in you. Let her work and assist her by taking the right attitude. You are the Sakshi, Anumanta, Bhokta, and Bharta. As Anumanta, give the command, as Sakshi watch her work out the result, as Bhokta enjoy the result and as Bharta help her by maintaining the Adhar. Do not ruin it by tamasic udasinata or rajasic revolt. Be sure your Will can never fail to act. You are the Jnata: receive all knowledge that presents itself to you. Adopt the attitude I have described here and apply it to every individual act of the sadhana or of life. You have nothing else to do. Kali will do the rest. Be not troubled, be not anxious, be not in haste, you have all eternity before you, why be in haste? Only do not be tamasic or idly waste your time. II I shall speak to-day of the Shakti or Will, since that is the foundation of Yoga. The Shakti is situated in the Sahasradala just above the crown of the head and from that seat of activity it works. Below it at the top of the brain is the higher Buddhi and below that, occupying the middle level of the brain, is the reason or lower buddhi, and below that, at the bottom of the brain, is the organ of communication with the Manas. We may call this organ the understanding. Knowledge, reason and understanding are the"},{"pageNumber":1387,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1373 three parts of the brain. These functions are in the subtle body, but they are connected with the corresponding portions of the material brain. In the chest just above the heart is the Manas, that is, the organ of sensation with its five subordinate Indriyas. Below the Manas, from the heart to midway between the heart and the navel, is the Chitta. From that point up to the navel and below it is the psychic or sukshma prana. All these are in the sukshma deha but connected at these points with the sthula deha. In the sthula deha itself two functions are situated, the physical prana or the nervous system and the annam or the material body. Now the will is the organ of the Ishwara or living master of the body. It works through all these functions, through the Buddhi for thought and knowledge, through the Manas for sensations, through the Chitta for emotions and through the Prana for enjoy- ment. When it functions perfectly, working in each organ according to the capacities of the organ, then the work of the Shakti becomes perfect and infallible. But there are two causes of weakness, er- ror and failure. First, the confusion of the organs. If the Prana interferes in sensation, emotion and thought, then a man becomes anisha, the slave of the Prana, that is to say, of the desires. If the Chitta interferes with sensation and thought, then the sensations and thoughts are falsified by the emotions and their corresponding wishes. For instance if love interferes with the Buddhi, the man becomes blind to the truth about the person he loves, he is unable to distinguish between right and wrong, kartavya and akartavya, where the person is concerned. He becomes to a greater or lesser extent the slave of the emotions, love, anger, hatred, pity, revenge etc. So, if the Manas interferes with the reason, the man mistakes his sensations for just ideas or true arguments. He judges by what he sees or hears instead of judging what he sees or hears. If again the reason, imagination, memory and logic interfere with knowledge, the man is debarred from higher knowledge and wanders in the interminable circle of probabilities and possibilities. Finally, if even the Buddhi interferes with the Will, then the man is limited by the power of his limited knowledge, instead of moving nearer to Omnipotence. In brief, if a machine or instrument is used for a"},{"pageNumber":1388,"pageContent":"1374 Record of Yoga work for which it is unfit, for which it was not made or originally adapted, then it either cannot do that work at all or it does it badly; dharma-sankara is created. Now what I have described is the ordinary state of men before they gain knowledge. It is all dharma-sankara, confusion of functions, bad administration and incompetent and ignorant government. The Will, the true minister, is rendered a puppet of the lower officials who work each for his own selfish ends, interfering with and hampering each other or dishonestly playing into each others hands, for their own benefit and to the detriment of the Ishwara, the master. He ceases to be Ishwara, he becomes Anisha, the puppet and dupe of his servants. Why does he allow it? Because of Ajnanam. He does not know, he does not realise what the ministers and officials and their million and one hangers-on are doing with him. What is this Ajnanam? It is inability to recognise his own true nature, position and authority. He began by being deeply interested in a small portion of his royal activity, the body. He thought “That is my kingdom.” He became the tool of his bodily functions. So with the nervous, the sensational, the emotional and the mental, he identifies himself with each of them. He forgets that he is different from them and much greater and stronger. What he must do is to resume the reins of power, to remember that he is Ishwara, the king, the master and God himself. He must on this understanding remember that he is all-powerful. He has a mighty minister, the Will. Let him support and direct the Will and the Will will introduce order into the government and compel the officials each to do obediently and perfectly his own duty. Not of course all at once. It will take time. The officials have become so much used to confused work and misgovernment that at first they will not be willing to work properly and, secondly, even when they wish, they will find it difficult. They hardly know even how to begin. For instance, when you begin to use your will, what is likely to happen? First you will try to use it through the Prana, through desire, wish, hope, or you will use it through the Chitta, with emotion, eagerness and expectation, or you will use it through the Manas using Cheshta, struggle, effort, as if you were physically wrestling with the thing you want to control; or you will use it through the Buddhi, trying to dominate the subject of your"},{"pageNumber":1389,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1375 interest by thought, by thinking “Let this be”, “Let that happen” etc. All these methods are used by Yogins to recover the power of the Will. The Hatha-yogin uses the Prana and the body, the Raja- yogin the heart, Manas and Buddhi, but the best method is none of these. Even the last of them is a second-best means and must en- tail struggle, failure and frequent disappointment. The Will is only perfect in its action when it works apart from all these, straight on the subject from the sahasradala, without effort, without emotion and eagerness and without desire. Each function to itself and Will is its own function. It always obeys the Ishwara but it acts in itself and by itself. It uses the rest, it must not be used by them. It uses the Buddhi for knowledge, not for command; it uses the Manas for sensation, not for either command or knowledge; it uses the heart for emotion, not for sensation, knowledge or command; it uses the Prana for enjoyment, not for any other function; it uses the body for motion and action, not as a thing that can limit or de- termine either knowledge, feeling, sensation, power or enjoyment. Therefore it must keep itself apart and command all these things as a thing separate from all of them. These are merely a yantra, a machine, the Purusha is the yantri or master of the machine, the Will is the electricity or motor-power. This is the right knowledge. How to use it I shall tell you af- terwards. That is a matter of practice, not of mere instruction. The man who has dhairyam, calm steadfastness, even in a small degree, can gradually accustom himself to the mastery of his machine by the Will. But he must first know: he must know the machine, he must know the motor-power, he must know himself. The knowledge need not be perfect in order to begin, but the elementary knowledge at least he must have. That is what I am trying to give you. I am explaining to you the different parts of the machine, their nature and functions, the nature of the Will and the nature of the Ishwara. III The Will when it begins to act, will be hampered by the Swa- bhava; therefore until you are able to act on the Swabhava, you will not, should not bring your Will to bear upon life. In other"},{"pageNumber":1390,"pageContent":"1376 Record of Yoga words while you are a sadhak of the Shakti marga, be a sadhak only; when you have got Siddhi of the Will, then first use the Siddhi to get perfection of the adhar, and when you have got perfection of the adhar, then use the siddha adhar for Karma, for life. The Swabhava opposes the perfect action of the Will. Why? Because the nature of humanity is imperfect, only partly evolved, asiddha, and being in all its dharmas asiddha, the tamasic force of habit, tamasi dhriti, makes it resist any attempt to make it siddha. Humanity is evolving. Yoga is a means of carrying that evolu- tion forward with great and victorious rapidity. But the imperfect Swabhava says, “I do not wish to be perfect, I am accustomed to imperfection and find it easy and comfortable.” First, then, the Will seizes hold of the Swabhava and removes the obstacles in the way of its own perfect development and action. As I have said, it first gets rid of the old samskaras of impossi- bility, the samskara, the ajnanam that I am man, not God, limited, not illimitable, helpless, not omnipotent. The Will has first to say, “I am omnipotent, that which the Purusha commands, I can act”. For the Will is the Shakti in action, and there is only one Shakti, Kali herself, who is God manifesting as Divine Energy. Next the Will seizes the adhar and makes it shuddha in order that the Will may itself be shuddha. I have explained that if there is confusion and disorder among the functions, then the Will cannot act omnipotently. Therefore you must first develop Jnanam and by Jnanam effect the shuddhi of the adhar. When the adhar becomes shuddha, the Will being entirely free from wrong samskaras and wrong action, is what I call shuddha. It works perfectly. Working perfectly it makes the adhar siddha, that is the adhar rids itself of all doshas, deficiencies and weaknesses and works perfectly. It becomes a perfect instrument for the Purushottama, the Purusha and Shakti to carry on their Lila. Knowledge, therefore, jnanam is the next stage to be consid- ered. But before I come to that, let me finish about the obstacles in the Swabhava. There are not only the wrong Samskaras and the ashuddhi of the adhar, but the general nature of things has certain tendencies or laws in it which oppose the development of the Yoga as well as certain tendencies which help the development of the"},{"pageNumber":1391,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1377 Yoga. There are three laws which oppose the law of persistence, the law of resistance and the law of recurrence: there are three laws which assist the law of gradual processes, the law of concentrated processes and the law of involved processes. The law of persistence is this, that a rule, habit or tendency once established has a right to survive, a natural unwillingness to be changed or annulled. The longer it has been established, the longer it takes to root out. If a man has been yielding to the shadripus for many lives without any serious effort to dominate them or purify himself, then he cannot by mere wish or a mere rapid effort get rid of them and become pure and calm. They refuse to be so cavalierly treated. They say “You have given us rights in this adhar, and we persist”. Still more hard to deal with are those dharmas of the body which men call the laws of physical nature. But the Will is omnipotent and if patiently, calmly and hero- ically exercised, will prevail. For the Will, I repeat, is Kali herself. Therefore in the end it establishes by its action new rules, habits or tendencies which fight with and gradually overcome the old. What then happens is that the old, though put down, weakened and no longer a real part of the nature, resist eviction from the adhar. They are supported by an army of forces or spiritual beings who surround you and live upon your experiences and enjoyments. This law of resistance marks the second period of the Yoga and, unless the Will has already become siddha and the adhar shuddha, is very trying and troublesome to the sadhak. For there seems to be no end to the capacity of resistance. Here again the Will is bound to triumph, if it is supported by faith or knowledge. Even then the evicted habits and tendencies strive continually to re-enter the system and recover their lost seats of power and enjoyment. This is called recurrence. In proportion as the Will is siddha and the Adhar shuddha, the recurrence becomes weaker and less frequent or, when it comes, less prolonged. But in an impure adhar, or with an imperfect Will, the recurrence is often as prolonged and troublesome as the resistance. On the other hand there are the three favourable laws. When a new habit or tendency is once established, it is the law that it shall develop towards strength and perfection. So long as it is struggling"},{"pageNumber":1392,"pageContent":"1378 Record of Yoga to establish itself, the Yogin may at any time become bhrashta, that is he may from error, weakness or impatience give up the struggle. That is the only fall for the Yogin. Failure, temporary defeat, is not bhramsa, so long as he refuses to give up the struggle. But once the right tendency is established, no man can destroy it, until it has enjoyed supremacy and its bhoga. Still at first, while the Will is comparatively weak or unprac- tised, the progress must be slow. In proportion as the perfection of the Will brings purity of the Adhar, the progress becomes rapid. Everything in this world is done by a process; a process means a series of actions leading to a particular result by certain recog- nised stages. These stages may be passed through slowly or swiftly, but so long as the law of gradual processes obtains, all the stages must be successively and consciously passed through. You have so many milestones to pass; but you may pass them walking, in a carriage, in a railway train, but pass them you must. Still by the growing strength of the Will, you can replace slow process by swift process. Then a time comes when Kali begins to transcend the ordinary human limits and becomes no longer the Shakti of a man, but the Shakti of God in man. It is then that gradual processes are replaced by concentrated processes. It is as if, instead of travelling from milestone to milestone you could leap from the first milestone to the third and so on to your journeys end. In other words the process remains the same but some of the stages seem to be dispensed with. In reality they are passed over so lightly as to escape notice and occupy little time. Therefore it is called a concentrated or contracted process. Lastly, when the man himself becomes God, either in a part of his actions or in the whole, then the law of concentrated processes gives place to the involved processes, when no process at all seems to be used, when the result follows the action instantaneously, in- evitably and miraculously. In reality there is no miracle, the process is used but so rapidly, with such a sovereign ease, that all the stages become involved or hidden in what seems a moments action. To most men it is enough, if they can reach the second stage; it is only the Avatar or the great Vibhuti who can reach the third."},{"pageNumber":1393,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1379 Therefore do not be discouraged by any failure or delay. It is purely a question of force and purity of the Will. By purity I mean freedom from desire, from effort, from misplacement. It is best to begin by concentrating effort on the self-purification of the Will, towards which the first necessity is passivity of desire for the fruit, the second the passivity of the Chitta and the Buddhi, while the will is being applied; the third the development of self-knowledge in the use of the Will. It will be found that by this process of educating the Will, ˆ atm ˆ anam ˆ atman ˆ a , purity of the adhar will also be automatically prepared and knowledge will begin to develop and act. IV What is knowledge? In what does it consist? We must distin- guish between knowledge in itself and the means of knowledge. Again, among the means we must distinguish between the instru- ments and the operations performed with the instruments. By Knowledge we mean awareness, taking a thing into active consciousness, into our Chaitanyam. But when we say, taking it into our Chaitanyam, what do we imply? Whence do we take it? The European says from outside, we say from inside, from Chaitanyam itself. In other words, all knowledge is an act of con- sciousness operating on something in the consciousness itself. In the first place everything we know exists in Parabrahman, that is, in our indivisible, universal self-existence. It is there, but not yet expressed, not vyakta. Then it exists in pure Chit, which is the womb of things as an idea of form, name and quality. It has name, form and quality in the Karana or Mahat, the causal, typal and ideal state of consciousness. Then it gets the possibility of change, development or modification in the Sukshma, the subtle, mental or plastic state of consciousness. Finally it gets the actual change, development, modification or evolution in the Sthula, the material or evolutionary state of consciousness. In the Karana there is no evolution, nothing ever changes, all is eternal. The Karana is Satyam. In the Sukshma all is preparation of change; it is full of imagination or anritam, therefore it is Swapna, not really false,"},{"pageNumber":1394,"pageContent":"1380 Record of Yoga but not immediately applicable to the Karana or Sthula. In the Sthula all evolves. It is partial satyam developing by the turning of old satyam into anritam, which is called destruction, and the turning of new anritam into new satyam, which is called creation. In the Karana there is no creation, no birth, no death, all exists for ever the only change is from type to type, from fulfilment to fulfilment. Therefore to know is really to be conscious of the thing in any or all of these three states. The knowledge of the Sthula is science. The knowledge of the Sukshma is philosophy, religion and metaphysics. The knowledge of the Karana is Yoga. When a man knows the Sthula, he knows it with his senses, that is, with the Manas, he knows the Sukshma with reason or the inspired intel- lect, he knows the Karana with the Jnanam or spiritual realisation. Therefore complete knowledge consists of three operations, first, objective Upalabdhi or experience, secondly, intellectual statement of your understanding of the thing, thirdly, subjective Upalabdhi or spiritual experience. The scientist begins from the bottom and climbs if he can, to the top. The Yogin begins from the top and descends for perfect proof to the bottom. You are not scientists, you are sadhaks. Therefore, when you speak of knowledge you must understand the process; you realise a thing by subjective experience, Bhava, then, think about it and formulate your experience in Artha and Vak, the combination which forms thought; you verify or test your experience by physical or objective experience. For instance you see a man. You want to know what he is, what he thinks and what he does. How does the scientist or the material man do it? He watches the man, he notes what he says, what are his expressions of speech and face, what are his actions, what sort of people he lives with, etc. All this is objective. Then he reasons from his objective experience. He says “The man says this or that, so he must think so and so or he must have such and such a character; his actions show the same, his face shows the same,” and so he goes on reasoning. If he does not get all the necessary facts, he fills them up from his imagination or from his memory, that is his experience of other men, of himself or of human life as read of in books or heard of from other people. He perceives, he observes,"},{"pageNumber":1395,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1381 contrasts, compares, deduces, infers, imagines, remembers and the composite result he calls reason, knowledge, fact. In reality he has arrived at a probability, for it is impossible for him to be sure that his conclusions are correct or anything indeed correct in his thought, except the actual observation, perceptions of his eye, ear, nose, touch, and taste. Anything beyond this the material man distrusts. Nothing is true to him except what he observes with his senses or what agrees with his sensory perceptions. Now what does the Yogin do? He simply puts himself into relation with the thing itself. Not with its form, name or quality, but with itself. He may never have seen the form, heard the name or had experience of the quality, but still he can know the thing. Because it is the thing itself and it is in himself and one with himself, that is in the Mahakarana in a man. There all meet the Atman and are so entirely one with the Atman that by merely being in contact with it, I can know everything about it. Few Yogins reach that state. But all the same, even in the Karana I can put myself in relation with the thing and know it by Bhava. I put myself, my soul, into relation with the soul of the man I study or the thing I study; Prajna in me becomes one with the Prajna in him or it. How do I do this? Simply by becoming passive and facing him or it in my Buddhi. If my Buddhi is quite pure or fairly purified, if my Manas is shanta, then I get the truth about him. I get it by Bhava, by spiritual or subjective realisation. Then I have to make the thing I have got clear and precise. To do that I must state it intellectually to my mind, that is, I must think about it. I have these ideas I am telling you in myself as unexpressed knowledge; they shape themselves in words, Vak, and take on a precise meaning, Artha. That is thought. Most people think vaguely, half expressing the thing in an imperfect Vak and a partial Artha. The Yogin must not do that. His thoughts must express themselves in clear and perfect sentences. He may know a thing without thinking it out, but if he thinks, he must think clearly and perfectly. The Yogin reasons when necessary, but not like the man of science. He sees the thing with his prophetic power interpreting the truth into thought; the pratyaksha gives him the Artha, the"},{"pageNumber":1396,"pageContent":"1382 Record of Yoga inspiration gives him the Vak, the intuition gives him the right con- clusion about it, the right siddhanta, the Viveka guards him from error. Behold the truth by these four simple operations perfectly thought out. If he has to argue, then the intuitions give him the right arguments. He has not to proceed painfully from one syllogism to another as the logician does. Finally, he verifies his knowledge by the facts of the objective world. He has seen the truth about the man by merely looking at him or at the idea of him; he has thought it out clearly and now he compares his idea with the mans action, speech etc. Not to test his truth; for he knows that a mans action, speech etc. only partially express the man and mislead the student; but in order to see how the truth he knows from the Karana is being worked out in the Sthula. He trusts the mans objective life only so far as it is in agreement with the deeper truth he has gained by Yoga. You see the immense difference. The only difficulty is that you have been accustomed to use the senses and the reason to the subordination and almost to the exclusion of the higher fac- ulties. Therefore you find it difficult to make the higher faculties active. If only you could start from the beginning, with the Bhava, the Atmajnana, how easy it would be! That will yet happen. But first, you have to get rid of the lower Buddhi, of the Indriyas in the manas, and awaken the activity of the higher faculties. They will see for you, hear for you, as well as think for you. First, then, get your sanskaras right. Understand intellectually what I have told you and will yet tell you. Then by use of the Will, keep the reason, imagination, memory, thought, sensations sufficiently quiet for the higher Buddhi to know itself as separate and different from these lower qualities. As the higher separates itself and becomes more and more active, the lower, already dis- couraged, will become less and less active and finally trouble you no more. Therefore Will first, then by Will, by Shakti, the Jnanam. First Kali, then Surya. I shall explain the various faculties when I have finished with the rest of the system."},{"pageNumber":1397,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1383 V If men were satisfied with indulging in reason, memory and imagination, the purification of the Buddhi and the development of the higher faculties would be an easy matter. But there is an- other means of thought which they habitually indulge in and that is Manas. The Manas is a receptive organ; it receives the images expressed on the eye, the ear etc., and turns them into what the Europeans call the percepts, that is, things perceived. Besides, it receives the ideas, images etc., sent down from the Vijnana into the Chitta and passes them on to the latter organ. In this passage these things become what are called concepts, that is, things conceived or thought of. For instance, when the mind sees the image of a book and says “A book”, it has hold of a percept the name of which it conceives; that is sensational thought. When it says “A book contains language” that is a remoter concept, intellectual thought. One merely puts things sensed into words, the other puts things thought into words. Percept and concept together make what is called understanding. Reason, according to the European idea, merely arranges percepts and concepts and draws from this ar- rangement fresh and more elaborate concepts. Many believe that concepts are merely percepts put together and converted into what is called thought. According to this idea, all thought is merely the arrangement of sensation in the terms of language. Even when I imagine an angel, I merely put a human figure and the wings of a bird together and give the combination a name, angel. Even when I talk of abstract qualities, for example, virtue, courage etc., I am not thinking of anything beyond sensation, but merely a classification of virtuous and courageous sensations and actions put together and labelled with the name virtue or courage. All these ideas are correct so far as the Manas or understanding is concerned. The Manas is an organ of sensation, not of thought. It catches thoughts on their way from the Buddhi to the Chitta, but in catching them it turns them into the stuff of sensations, as described above. It regards them from the point of view of sensations. Animals think with their Manas and animals are not able to form ideas"},{"pageNumber":1398,"pageContent":"1384 Record of Yoga that do not relate themselves to some image, form, sound, smell, touch, taste, etc. They are bound by their sensations. That is why in animals the Buddhi is dormant; so far as it acts, it acts behind the veil. But man can become aware of things which the senses cannot grasp, buddhigr ˆ ahyam at ˆ ındriyam . The proof of that you can get daily, when the Yogic power is developed. This single fact that man can see with his Buddhi the truth about a thing he has never seen or known before, is enough to destroy the materialistic idea of thought. That idea is only true of the Manas. The Manas responds to the senses and is always forming percepts and concepts about the sensations it receives. These ideas it sometimes gets from the outside world, sometimes from the passive memory in the Chitta, sometimes from the Buddhi. But it tries to impose them all on the Buddhi. It tests everything which it does not take for granted by reference to the senses. “I saw that”, “I heard that”, therefore it is true, that is the reasoning of the Manas. That is why people who have a poorly developed Buddhi, attach so much importance to what they have seen or read. “I have seen it in print” says the just literate man, and he thinks he has closed the argument. What are we to do with the Manas? Get it to be still, says the Yogin. While it is busy, knowledge is impossible. You can get only fragments of knowledge. That is true and the quiet mind is no doubt essential to the Yogin. But what of the senses? Concepts in the Manas you may get rid of, but what are you to do with the percepts? You cannot stop seeing, hearing etc., except when you are in Samadhi. That is why the Vedantin attaches so much importance to samadhi. It is the only condition in which he is safe from the persistent siege of the percepts of the senses. But if you can only exercise knowledge when you are in Samadhi, then you will have to become an ascetic or recluse, a man who gives up life or thought. That is a necessity which cuts the unity of Gods world into two and makes an unnatural division in what should be indivisible. The Tantric knows that this is not necessary, that Samadhi is a great instrument, but not the only instrument. He so arranges his antahkarana that he can know when he is walking,"},{"pageNumber":1399,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1385 talking, acting, sleeping, whatever he is doing. How? By not only stilling the conceptual activity of the Manas but by transferring to the Buddhi its perceptual activity. In other words he sees, hears etc., not with the senses in the manas, but with the Indriya in the Buddhi. You will find what a difference this makes. Not only do you see much more perfectly, minutely, accurately than before, but you are able to appreciate colours, forms, sounds etc., in a way you never did before. And besides you are able to catch the soul, the Guna, the essential quality and emotion of a thing, the moment you are aware of it. This is part of what the Yoga calls Prakamya, the absolute and sovereign activity of the Indriya. Therefore when the Yoga is perfect, you will not be troubled by the Manas. It will cease to perceive. It will be merely a passage, a channel for things from the Buddhi to the Chitta. There are many ways of bringing this about, but most of them suffer from this defect, that you get the thinking part of the Manas still, but the perceiving part retains its inferior and hampering activity. The best way is to use the Will simultaneously for awaking the Jnanam and for stilling the Manas. This method has two advantages. First, you do not, as in the ordinary method, have to make your mind a blank. That is a powerful but very difficult and trying discipline or Tapasya. You simply replace by degrees the activity of the lower reason by the activity of the higher thought, the activity of the mind by the activity of the same organ and the sense-perceptions by the activity of the Prakamya. This process is less painful and more easy. Secondly, you cannot stop perceiving so long as you are not in Sushupti, you only stop thinking. So you cannot make your mind blank. Unless you wake the Jnanam first, how are you going to get rid of this intrusive element? The Prakamya must be there already active before the ordinary perceptions can stop work. This then is the third operation of the Tantric method. You develop the Will, you use the Will to awaken the Jnanam, you use the Will to still the mind and the lower Buddhi and you use the Jnanam to replace them."},{"pageNumber":1400,"pageContent":"1386 Record of Yoga VI I come next to Chitta. There are two layers in the Chitta, one for the emotions, the other for passive memory. In the lower layer of the Chitta, the impressions of all things seen, thought, sensed, felt are recorded and remain until the Jiva leaves this body. Even af- terwards all these impressions are taken up with the Sukshma body and go with the Jiva into the other worlds. When he is born again, they are brought with him as latent samskaras in the Muladhara; that is why people do not remember their past births, but can get back the memory by awakening the Kundalini in the Muladhara. These impressions are latent in the Chitta until the active memory in the Buddhi calls for them. Those which are continually brought to the Buddhi have a habit of recurring even when not wanted, habit- ual thoughts, ideas, sentiments, opinions etc., which are the Yogins chief trouble until the Manas in which they occur becomes quiet. The second and the upper layer is that of emotion. The emo- tions are the acts of Will sent down into the Chitta and there assuming the form of impulses. There are three divisions, thought- impulses, impulses of feeling, and impulses of action. The first are called by various names, instincts, inspirations, insights, intuitions etc. They are really messages sent down by the Jiva from the Sahas- radala into the Chitta, they pass unobserved through the Buddhi, lodge in the Chitta and, whenever excited by any contact external or internal, start up suddenly and strike the Buddhi with the same force as the real inspirations etc., which come down direct from the Vijnana to the Buddhi. But they come up coloured by emotions, distorted by associations and memories in the Chitta, perverted by the imagination which brings them up. Much of what is called faith, Bhakti, genius, poetic inspiration etc., comes from this source. It is useful to the ordinary man, all important to the animal, but a hindrance to the Yogin. The impulses of feeling are what are ordinarily called emo- tions. The emotions are of two kinds , natural or eternal, artificial or Vikaras. Love is natural, it proceeds from Jnanam and tends to endure in the evolution; hatred is a Vikara from love, a distortion or reaction caused by Ajnanam. So courage is eternal, fear is Vikara;"},{"pageNumber":1401,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1387 compassion is eternal, ghrina or weak pity, repulsion, disgust etc., are Vikaras. Those which are natural and eternal, love, courage, pity, truth, noble aspirations, are Dharma; the others are Adharma. But this is from the eternal standpoint and has nothing to do with Samajic or Laukic or temporary Dharma or Adharma. Moreover, Adharma is often necessary as a passage or preparation for passing from an undeveloped to a developed, a lower to a higher Dharma. The Yogin has to get rid of Vikaras, but not of Sanatana Dharmas. The third kind of impulse is the impulse to action. Its presence in the Chitta is a temporary arrangement due to the rajasic develop- ment of the human being. The asuddha rajasic man cannot easily be stirred into action, except through two forces, desire or emotion. Love, hatred, ambition, rage etc., must stir in him or he cannot act, or acts feebly. He cannot understand shuddha pravritti, action without desire and independent of emotion. Emotion should only give a colour to the mans swabhava or temperament. He should be habitually full of feelings of love, courage, honour, true ambition, self-reliance etc., but he should not act from any individual impulse of however noble a character. He should act in obedience to the impulse from the Will in direct communication with the Purusha in the Vijnana, understanding with the Buddhi why the Will acts in that particular way and colouring the act with the emotion ap- propriate to his Swabhava. But neither the Buddhi nor the emotion should directly interfere with or try to determine his action. The Buddhi is for thought and the Chitta for emotion. Neither of them have anything to do with action in the shuddha state. The intel- lectual Asura determines his actions by his reason or his ideal, the emotional Asura by his feelings. But the shuddha determines them by the higher inspiration proceeding from the divine existence in the Vijnana. That is what people often call the Adesha. Only the shuddha can safely rely on having this kind of Adesha, the asuddha Yogin often mistakes his own ideas, imaginations, emotions or even desires for the Adesha. Therefore what the Yogin must aim at, is to get rid of the activity of his lower Chitta or the old impressions by stilling the Manas as described in my last lecture; get rid of his instinctive thought or thought-impulses by the same means; get rid of the"},{"pageNumber":1402,"pageContent":"1388 Record of Yoga habit of acting on his emotions by allowing the will to silence his impulses and purify his emotions . He should prohibit and inhibit by the Will all action or speech that starts blindly from the passions or emotions surging in his heart. The emotions will then become quiet and must be habituated to come as a sort of wave falling into a sea, instead of surging furiously into action. These quiet waves which are satisfied with existing and do not demand satisfaction in action or seek to dominate the life or the ideas, are the purified emotions. Those which rise upward into the Buddhi and try to shape the thought or opinion, those which move outward into speech or action, are asuddha emotions. What I mean is that the emotions in the Chitta are for enjoyment only; the action must be dominated by a higher principle. There again it is the Will that must purify, govern and renew the heart. Only, it has the best chance of doing it if the knowledge has first become active and the mind is still. A still mind means a heart easily purified. VII I come next to Prana, the nervous or vital element in man which is centralised below the Manas and Chitta in the subtle body and connected with the navel in the Sthula Deha. Here I must distinguish between the Sukshma Prana and the Sthula Prana, the former moving in the nervous system of the subtle body as described in the Yogic books, the latter in the nervous system of the gross body. The two are closely connected and almost always act upon each other. The prana forms the link between the physical and the mental man. I must here warn you against stumbling into the error of those who try to harmonise Yogic Science with the phys- ical science of the Europeans and search for the Yogic Nadis and Chakras in the physical body. You will not find them there. There are certain centres in the physical nervous system with which the Chakras correspond, otherwise Hathayoga would be impossible. But the Chakras are not these centres. The Europeans are masters in their own province of knowledge and there you need not hesitate to learn from them, but for Gods sake do not subject your higher"},{"pageNumber":1403,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1389 knowledge to their lower; you will only create a most horrible confusion. Develop your higher knowledge first, then study their sciences and the latter will at once fall into their place. It is with the Sukshma Prana that I am principally concerned; for the Sthula Prana belongs to the Annam rather than to the Antah- karana and I will speak of it in connection with the Annam. The Sukshma Prana is the seat of desire and its purification is of the utmost importance to the Yogin. Until you have got rid of desire, you have accomplished nothing permanent. When you have got rid of desire, you are sure of everything else. That is why the Gita says “Get rid of desire first”. Only until you have got knowledge and can learn to use your will to still the mind and purify the emotions, you cannot utterly get rid of desire. You may drive it out by Samyama, you may hold it down by Nigraha but eventually it is of no use, for it will return. “Prakritim y ˆ anti bh ˆ ut ˆ ani nigrahah kim karishyati.” Creatures follow after nature; what is the use of coercion? That is to say, it has a temporary result and the coerced desires come back ravening and more furious than before. That was what Christ meant by the parable of the devil, the unclean spirit who is driven out of a man only to return with seven spirits worse than himself. For it is the nature of things, the unalterable nature of things, that unpurified emotion must clamour after desire, an unstilled Manas give it harbourage whenever it returns, an unilluminated Buddhi contain the seed of it ready to sprout up at the first opportunity. Therefore unless the whole Anta hkarana is purified, unless you get a new heart and a new mind, desire cannot be got rid of; it returns or it remains. When however an illuminated understanding lighting up the action of a strengthened Will and supported by a pure heart, casts desire into the Sukshma Prana and attacks it there in its native place, it can be utterly destroyed. When you have a visuddha Buddhi you will be able to distinguish these various organs and locate all your mental activities. Desire can then be isolated in the Prana and the heart and mind kept pure of its insistent inroads. For desire is only effective when it can get hold of the Chitta and Buddhi, generating Vikaras of emotion and perversions of knowledge which give it strength to impose itself on the Will and so influence internal and external action. It is most powerful in the higher kind of human"},{"pageNumber":1404,"pageContent":"1390 Record of Yoga being when it masks itself as a principle or ideal or as a justifiable emotion. Remember moreover that all desires have to be got rid of, those which are called good, as well as those which are called bad. Some people will tell you, keep the good desires and drive out the bad. Do not listen to that specious piece of ignorance. You can use the good desires to drive out the bad on condition that immediately after you drive out the good also by the one desire of Mumukshutwa, liberation and union with God. And even that last desire finally you must renounce and give yourself up wholly to Gods will, even in that last and greatest matter, becoming utterly desireless, nishk ˆ ama nihspriha. Otherwise you will find yourself travelling in a vicious circle. For if you keep desire at all, he is such a born traitor that he will eventually open the door to your enemies. When the unclean spirit returned to his house, he found it swept and garnished, that is, purified of bad thoughts and adorned with good desires, and immediately he got in and made the last state of that man worse than his first. So get rid of all desires utterly, good, bad and indifferent. Get beyond virtue as well as beyond vice. Be satisfied with no bondage even though the fetters be of pure gold. Admit no guide or master but God, even though they be gods or angels who claim your homage. Desire is composed of three elements, attachment or Asakti, longing or Kamana, and preference or Ragadwesha. Get rid of attachment first. Use your will and purified Antahkarana to throw out that clinging and insistence on things, which says “I must have that, I cannot do without that,” and returns on the idea of it, even when it is persistently denied. When the emotions are quiet, this Asakti will of itself die away, but for a time it will rage a great deal and try to get the emotions active again. Apply the Will steadily and patiently and do not get disturbed by failure; for desire is a terrible thing, as difficult to get rid of as a leech. It is indeed the daughter of the horse-leech crying “Give, give.” Do not violently silence the cry; ignore it and use your Will to get rid of the clamourer. When Asakti becomes weak, Kamana loses nine tenths of its force and you can easily throw it off. Still for some time, out of sheer habit, the longing for certain things will come, not in the heart or Buddhi, but in the"},{"pageNumber":1405,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1391 Prana; only if Asakti is gone, the refusal of the thing craved will not leave behind it a permanent grief or continual hunger. There will only be temporary disturbance of the peace of the heart. When you have got rid of the Kamana, even then Raga may remain, and if Raga is there, Dwesha is sure to come in. You will not ask or crave for anything; for Kamana is gone; but when some things come, you will not like them; when other things come, you will feel glad and exultant. You will not rebel or cling to what you have, but you will not like the coming of the evil, you will not like the loss of your joy, even though you say “Very good” and submit. Get rid of that Raga and Dwesha and have perfect Samata. When you have perfect Samata, then either you will have perfect Shanti, divine peace, or else perfect or Shuddha Bhoga, divine enjoyment. Shanti is the negative Ananda and those have it who rest in the Nirguna Brahman. Shuddha Bhoga is the positive Ananda and those have it who rest in the Trigunatita Ananta Brah- man. You can have both and it is best to have both. God enjoys the world with Shuddha Bhoga based on the perfect Shanti. Most people cannot imagine Bhoga wit hout Kama, enjoyment without desire. It is a foolish notion, none the less foolish because it is natural and almost universal. It is Ajnanam, a fundamental part of ignorance. Enjoyment does not really begin until you get rid of desire. That which you get as the result of satisfied desire is troubled, unsafe, feverish, or limited, but Shuddha Bhoga is calm, self-possessed, victorious, unlimited, without satiety and Vairagya, immortally blissful. It is in a word, not Harsha, not Sukha, but Ananda. It is Amrita, it is divinity and immortality, it is becoming of one nature with God. The soul has then no kama, but it has pure lipsa, an infinite readiness to take and enjoy whatever God gives it. Grief, pain, disgrace, everything that is to rajasic men a torture, changes then to bliss. Even if such a soul were to be cast into hell, it would not feel hell, but heaven. It would not only say with the Bhakta “This is from the beloved” but with the perfect Jnani “This is the Beloved; this is the Anandam Brahman: this is the Kantam, the Shivam, Shubham, Sundaram.” I need not repeat the process by which this purification is effected.

VIII There remains the Sthula, the gross part of man which is com- posed of the Sthula Prana or physical nervous system and the annam or body in which the prana operates. The prana is the principle of life, death is brought about by the dissolution of the tie between the sukshma deha and the sthula deha. That tie is the prana. The sukshma deha takes the prana into itself and departs; the little that is left in the gross body is of the nature of apana with a tendency to that species of dissolution which we call corruption. The prana part of it, which can alone hold the body together, evaporates and the apana leads to swift disintegration. In some animals, however, the prana is so abundant that the body shows signs of life even after the sukshma deha has departed. I have been dealing throughout with the purification of the sukshma part of man, the Antahkarana or mind, the subject of the body is a little foreign to my purpose. Nevertheless a few words are necessary. The principle upon which this Yoga I am explaining to you stands, is that the gross body is merely the shadow or creation of the subtle. Body is a mould into which mind pours itself, but the mould itself has been prepared by the mind and can be changed by the mind. A mind purified, liberated and perfected (siddha) can do whatever it likes with the body. It may leave it as it is, allowing the past karma to do its will with the physical part in the form of disease, suffering, misfortune and death, without the mind being in the least affected. All that is impurity and bondage, which is the physical translation and result of mental impurity and bondage. With the cessation of the cause, the effect ceases; but not at once. It is again like the steam and the locomotive. The habits, the results created by past lives, are expelled from the mind and precipitated"},{"pageNumber":1407,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1393 entirely into the body. You may allow them to work themselves out there, many do that. On the other hand, you may pursue them into the body and drive them out from there as well. In that case you get the Kayashuddhi and the Kayasiddhi. They are usually sought after by the Hathayogic or Rajayogic processes, but these are not necessary. It is even better and certainly much easier and surer to follow the process I have been indicating. The very fact of having a purified mind makes for purity of the body, a liberated mind for liberation of the body, a perfected mind for perfection of the body, and to a certain extent as you go on with the yoga in the Antahkarana, the body will automatically begin to respond to the new influences. But you should not consciously meddle with the body until you have finished with the mind. Let nature do its work. Detach yourself as much as possible from the body, think of it as a mere case, leave it to the care of God and His Shakti. Many sadhaks are frightened by illness in the course of the Yoga. You need not be frightened, for you have put yourself in Gods hands and He will see to it. It will come to you only as a part of the necessary process for purification of the body, work itself out, fade and return no more. Other disturbances of the body will come which are incidental to the turning of an unfit physical adhar into a fit one. Profound alterations are necessary in your brain- cells, your nervous system, your digestive and secretive processes and they cannot be effected without some physical disturbance, but it will never be more than is necessary for the process. Do no violence of any kind to the body; if you use physical remedies, let them be of the simplest and purest kind; above all dismiss anxiety and fear. You cannot care more for yourself than God cares for you. Only your care is likely to be ignorant and unwise; His is with knowledge and uses the right means to the right end. Impurities in the body show themselves chiefly as disease, as pain, as the discomfort of heat and cold, as the necessity of the excretive processes. The first sign of Kayashuddhi is the disap- pearance of all tendency to disease; the second is liberation from the dwandwa of heat and cold, which will either go altogether or change to pleasurable sensations often marked by electrical phe- nomena; and the third, the diminution or disappearance of excretive"},{"pageNumber":1408,"pageContent":"1394 Record of Yoga activity. Pain also can be entirely eliminated from the body, but even before the reaction called pain is got rid of, or even without its being got rid of, the discomfort of pain can be removed and replaced by a sort of bodily Ananda. Finally, the craving of hunger and thirst disappears from the prana to which it belongs and the dependence on food diminishes or ceases. The perfection of all this is the basis of Kayasiddhi. But perfect Kayasiddhi includes other developments such as the siddhis of Mahima, Laghima, Anima and the invulnerability and incorruptibility of the body, powers hitherto attained in the Kaliyuga only by very advanced Siddhas. They depend primarily on the replacement of the ordinary fivefold processes of prana, apana, vyana, samana and udana by the single simplified action of the original or elemental force of prana, the infinite vital energy surcharged with electricity, vaidyutam. All these are important elements of Tantric Yoga, but I have mentioned them only cursorily because they are foreign to my pur- pose. They can all be developed if the mental siddhi is perfected and it is on this perfection that I wish you to concentrate your energy and attention. When you get that, you get everything. The centres of mans activity, at present, are the buddhi, the heart and the manas, and the body, though extremely important, is a dependent and subordinate function. It has not to be despised on that account, but most people give it an undue importance. When the Jiva is Ishwara of his mind, his body falls into its proper place and instead of interfering and often domineering over the mind and will, it obeys and takes its stamp from them. The Europeans are obsessed with the idea of the physical as the master of the mental. I would have you hold fast to the opposite standpoint and always remember that for the body to impose its conditions on the mind is an abnormal state of mans being, which has to be got rid of; it is the mind that must command, condition and modify the body. IX CONCLUSION I have finished what I had to say. I will only add a word in conclusion. You must not think that what I have given you, is all"},{"pageNumber":1409,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1395 the knowledge you need about yourself or about the Yoga. On the contrary, these are only certain indications necessary at a particular stage; they are chiefly important for purification, which is the first part of the Yoga. After the shuddhi is complete one has to perfect the mukti, to get liberation, a thing easy after shuddhi, impossible before it. By mukti I do not mean laya , which is a thing not to be pursued or desired, but waited for whenever God wills, but liberation from ignorance, Ahankara and all dualities. With the progress of the purification, there will be a natural tendency to- wards liberation and the farther stages of yoga, bhukti and siddhi, liberated enjoyment and perfection. As you go forward you will have to change your attitude, not radically but in certain important points. That, however, I will not meddle with. It is well to do one thing at a time. In all that I have written, I have taken one standpoint to which many of you have not been accustomed. If you regard Vairagyam as the beginning of all wisdom, you will not be satisfied with me. Vairagyam is to me merely a useful temporary state of mind which God uses to enforce rejection of that to which the old samskaras cling too obstinately to be unseated from it by mere abhyasa. Jnanam is essential to shuddhi and mukti; but Jnanam must be assisted either by abhyasa or by vairagya until the mind is still and lets knowledge do its own work. As soon as the mind is still and not susceptible to resuscitation of its old energies from outside, the Jnanam develops, the Shakti pursues its task unhampered; there is then no sadhan for you, only a progressive siddhi without any de- liberately adopted method, increasing by the mere easy and natural process of Nature as a man breathes or sees or walks. All necessity for either abhyasa or vairagya ceases. Attachment to vairagya is as harmful as attachment to lobha itself. Again if you think with the Buddhists that all life is a misery and extinction of some kind the highest good, or if you think with the Mayavadin that we came into this world with no other object but to get out of it again as soon as possible, like the famous general whose greatest military exploit was to march up a hill in order to march back again, you had better pass me by.

Ananda and Shakti, these are the two real terms of existence. Sorrow and weakness are vikaras born of ajnanam, of the forgetfulness of the high and true self. These are not universal or eternal things, but local and temporary, local mainly of this earth, temporary in the brief periods of the Kali yuga. Our business is to bring down heaven on earth for ourselves and mankind, to eliminate sorrow and weakness from the little corners of existence and time, where they are allowed to exist. I do not give any assent to the gloomy doctrine which preaches a world of sorrow and inaction and withdrawal from it as the sole condition of bliss and freedom, which thinks, contrary to all reason and knowledge, that God in himself is blessed, but God in manifestation accursed. I will not admit that the Brahman is a fool or a drunkard dreaming bad dreams, self-hypnotised into miserable illusions. I do not find that teaching in the Veda; it does not agree with my realisations which are of the actuality of unalterable bliss and strength and knowledge in the midst of desireless phenomenal action. I am of the mind of Sri Krishna in the Mahabharata when he says, “Some preach action in this world and some preach inaction; but as for those who preach inaction, I am not of the opinion of those weaklings.” Na me matam tasya durbalasya. But the action he holds up as an example, is the action of the great Gods, even as Goethe speaks of the action of the great natural forces, disinterested, unwearying, self-poised in bliss, not inert with the tamas, not fretful with the rajas, not limited even by the sattwic ahankara action made one in difference with the Purushottama, my being in His being, my shakti only a particular action of His infinite shakti, of Kali. I am not ignorant, I am not bound, I am not sorrowful: I only play at being ignorant, I only pretend to be bound; like an actor or like an audience I only take the rasa of sorrow. I can throw it off when I please. Who calls me degraded and sinful, a worm crawling upon the earth among other worms? I am Brahman, I am He; sin cannot touch me. Who calls me miserable? I am God, all blissful. Who calls me weak? I am one with the Omnipotent. He, being One, has chosen to be Many.

For it is as well to guard against certain misconceptions which may arise from the brevity of the writer and his omission of some important points considered by him, no doubt, to be, however important, yet outside his scope. The prohibition of cheshta in the ideal use of the will does not imply the renunciation of Karma. The cheshta referred to is internal, not external, arambha, not karma. The distinction is that made by Sri Krishna in the Gita when he holds up the ideal of action with renunciation of all arambhas, sarv ˆ arambh ˆ an parityajya .We are to do actions with the body, mind, buddhi, senses, each doing its own separated work in its absolute purified simplicity, kevalair , without any desire, expectation or straining in the will after either action or its success. The sadhak should abstain from applying his method to important actions in life until the higher purified will is to some extent trained, and even then it will be best for him to apply it to things of smaller moment first, then to those of greater moment. During the sadhana subjective progress and superfluous action small or great should be his main fields for test and training. Secondly, it must not be supposed that the treatment in these short lectures is intended to be full or exhaustive or even that in those points which it handles at the greatest length all has been said that the sadhak needs to know. On the contrary, only a few main ideas have been broadly struck out which may be useful to the beginner. The more advanced will find that they have rapidly outgrown the utility of these hints and that they have to be greatly enlarged on and modified before the knowledge at which they point can be considered full and satisfactory. Finally, the aim of the particular path of Yoga indicated is not the assertion of the individual will, but surrender of the in- dividual will, its absolute, unreserved and ungrudging surrender into the direction and control of the Infinite Being. The training of the system or adhar prescribed has for its purpose, first, the subjugation of the clamorous desires and impulses, the stubborn pride and egoism, the vain self-sufficient reason and imagination"},{"pageNumber":1413,"pageContent":"Yogic Sadhan 1399 of the unregenerate man so that they may not interfere with the completeness of the surrender, secondly, the possession of a strong, mighty and effective will to offer as a yajna to the Most High and not one that is weak, distracted, ignorant and diffident.

Millions of men are waiting for the day that comes but it comes not till the light has descended. And who shall make the light descend? Half lights will not do, they prepare and pass and fade. The whole light, the unveiled power. We behind the veil wait for our hour; not to a world such as is now can we come. We are the sons of the glory, the children of immortality, the flames of God. When the divine Light descends, then we descend. But we know that an hour approaches and the dawn is red, red as blood and red with blood, the fire is behind, the fire of the Angel of the Presence. Light first, strength with the light, joy with the strength, love with the joy, the fourfold splendour. Who shall contain it within himself and give harbourage to all the Godhead? Who shall have the unfath- omable calm that shall support all the light and neither be blasted by the fire nor spill it like an insufficient vessel? The strength, who shall be bold enough to bear it, mighty enough not to shrink from the terror and marvel of its works, great and sweet enough to turn its lion forces into the path of the Lover? Who shall be the sea of the universal joy and swallow up into it the poisons of the universe and his throat not even be blackened by the fire of the poison?

The rajasic fuel of the nervous being gets exhausted by too rapid an expenditure often for quite useless purposes and t hen the mist precipitates itself downward. The result is a laxity of the nervous system and a re- sultant laxity of the mind. It is a tamasic state no doubt, but if the rajas of the wrong kind can be lessened by it and cast away and only the rajas that is fit for feeding the sattwic fire preserved and increased, then a greater fire of the upward light can be established which may perhaps burn up the mist on the heights.

Why not, if the Power in you wills or if you can wake its action; but there is no need to force yourself at present if your system is reluctant. I do not know the future positively.

The Shakti of the future has been as if ascending a steep ascent and is now approaching the summit from which she will be able to see the field of her work before her. The field is full of contrary forces and her first steps must be covert and behind a shield of self-veiling and only partially revealing movements. Other movements must be thrown in front which will attract the attention of the hostile forces, movements not of the definite future, but still helpful to prepare the field, and it is only when she has gathered sufficient material force that she will throw off disguise and come to the front to take up the direct battle. That is why at first the quicker movement will be only that of the flowing stream, a penetration and spreading and enlargement of the current. When there is the greater tide of movement, then the battle will be near and the Shakti will unveil her real figure. There is a storm approaching, but it is of the outside movement, and as I am not in close touch with those forces, I cannot see clearly whether it merely threatens at present and will keep for a time the atmosphere surcharged and heavy or will break out into an early violence. I see the power that broods upon this outer movement, but his mind is not open to me. —————————————— . I have finished saying what was immediately in my mind and have been simply thinking in the writing to materialise my thoughts a little. If you wish to say anything, I am ready to reply to you. Bolshevism is more distant to me, but it is part of the outer movement, only it has more force of reality than others I was thinking of. The movements of Europe have a potential or an actual violence of the power of execution in them which makes them press for realisation more rapidly; but it is the future which is preparing to arise in the East of which I was thinking.

I shall have to see more closely before I can say. From a distance I can only see things that prepare by bits; the sudden shocks that will break down what is established seem to me to be yet at a distance, but at what distance I cannot say. That is a thing in which I have no right to give suggestions. The powers that preside over your destiny and the work have to settle that between them; but I doubt not that when the action is ready, the guidance will come. Spirits like myself are too little a part of the already materialising will of the terrestrial destiny to hazard their thoughts in the matter. The future, besides, can only be seen by me in tendency, in figures of general power. . I may be able to speak of more definite things hereafter, but not at present. [5] My wish is to make a few observations first, but please remain absolutely still in the mind or I shall not be able to manage. — The age of our coming is the age of the omnipotence of the second emanation. The first is the age of the Spiritual without form, the second that of the spiritual possessing matter. The first, I mean, the age in which we formerly came. Therefore our coming depends upon your ability to lay hold on matter and make of it a true mould of the spiritual influx. In the former age there were symbols, but no true body. Therefore the spirit receded and left the other principles to play out their possibilities without its direct intervention. Now there is a second chance for us. That is why I have drawn near, more for help to myself than for anything else, to make a suitable connection in my psychical principle with the material and the work of the spirit upon it. This is to explain my side of the communication. Whatever I see or say about things on the earth is through a previous psychical translation and you must so understand it and not expect too great a precision at present in my communications. The tendencies of the present I can see and floating images of the future; but as the real body of the psychic worlds is not present to the physical mind, but only appears like a dream or"},{"pageNumber":1430,"pageContent":"1416 Record of Yoga imagination, so to my psychic mind is the body of the material world. This presents a difficulty which most who do this writing do not appreciate. It is only spirits who are very near to the earth who can to some extent see it with similar eyes to physical beings and they too borrow a great deal from the ideas, the mental suggestions and the nervous being of the one who writes and those about him so as to harmonise their mentality with that of men and make themselves intelligible. This I do not wish to do, as it brings much that is false and inferior into the communication. Please therefore be as still in mind as possible so that there may be a minimum of mixture. Now if you want to say anything I am ready. It is only minds who have a new idea either full of the spir- itual influence or touched by thoughts that are helpful to it who can prepare the age that seeks to come. But there are those who have ideas only on the intellectual plane and no idea of anything behind and there are those who have spiritual experience but no power to embody or materialise. These give us no sufficient hope, whatever they may do for the moment. It is where there is the spiritual experience or the ideas that give it a mental body and along with that a strong will to materialise from whom we can expect the fulfilment of that for which we are awaiting. You are among the comparatively few who have these things. It is therefore either you if you are chosen and remain faithful to yourselves or those like you to whom we must look for the preparation of the future. Because of the psychical vision. I can see something of your souls or at least its signs, even if I cannot see your bodies. No, impossible, not in the period of transition. That is because you have been less spiritually exclusive than myself; you have incarnated through the centuries and done work for mankind and you now continue that work and yours therefore is the right or, if you like, the spiritual necessity to labour for the great ages of mankind.

I did the action that prepared myself for spiritual growth, but not in my last movements the action that goes outward. If I were to come now without the help of a favourable new age to externalise my spirit, I should have to begin by a form of mind corresponding to my last mental formation and start from that working out of it what was opposed to the action. I should not be a sufficient force for help to the world at this critical period. I might even join myself to old ideas having too much of the spiritual overstress. On the other hand if I come at a juncture where the right kind of work has already begun, I shall have the most favourable circum- stances for making the most of my earthly destiny for myself and others. That is a difficult question. It involves from my point of view a working out of an equation between your psychical forces as I see them and the circumstances of your earthly destiny as they are determined by the force of your past and the force of your future lives. I do not know enough for that, and I could not possibly do it satisfactorily in a few words or a little time. Besides there is the force of the collective need and the collective resistance to consider. If one could see not from the psychical but the higher principle it would be easy enough but I cannot do that at present. I think you should leave this question to another occasion. At present I should probably get only a side light which might be misleading. Everywhere, to one degree or another, but to find them is no such easy matter. In number they are already thousands, but all of them have not found their way. Some need a lead and some a leader and some the destined moment for casting into form of thought and action what is now only a desire and an impulse. Some are meant only for the first steps and some for the greater things afterwards. It is not possible that you should coalesce with all of them; there are too many mental and temperamental differences, especially with those who have already taken their direction. No. I began as what you would now call a Rishi, but I found no satisfaction in the things that were around me nor in the level of knowledge reached by my fellows.

But when I felt myself full of the higher light and would have turned to pour it around me, I found I had cut the connection between the power of knowledge and the effective will to action, cut too the thread of similarity and sympathy which could have made a line of communication between my knowledge and the minds of others. My body too was a stranger to the principle which filled my spirit. I determined to come in another life, in another body; but when I retired, I found the inability to descend except at a sacrifice for which I was not ready. Therefore I had to wait for others to do what I might otherwise have done and to prepare the conditions for my return. I shall not be one of the initiators, but I shall be one of those who help to make the knowledge endure in the mind of the new humanity. [6] Notmyselfatfirst My desire is to suggest to you to enlarge your view of the things you are about to do. The steps you are taking are not in consonance with the scope of the power you are calling down. First, be sure of the presence of the power, certainly; but do not limit its action by too prudent a beginning. The power of the work is not the power of your past life nor temperament, not the power of Mahasaraswati which governed the past existences that have been revealed to you, but of Mahakali, the swift and forceful Shakti. The desire to lay a slow and sure basis which belongs to the careful reason and its experimental skill is not the genius of the work you have to do. The other side of the Shakti which hitherto has acted only on occasions, will be the force that presides over the not distant future. — The limitations of the past were due to the heavy siege of the opposing powers and the obstacles they were able to heap about you. Some of these are already half dead and the others are beginning to lose their right; therefore be ready in a shorter time than you imagine to change your notions of the immediate future.

A force that hesitates not over its steps, that overbears and does not spend time in going round obs tacles, that enlarges swiftly its means and moves over great spaces in short periods, can alone create the new world that is seeking to be born. ———— The forces that stand against you are great in appearance, but only in appearance; great no doubt still in material means, but smit- ten with the spirit of death in the very heart of those means. Their strength to endure derives only from the hesitations, the weakness of will, the slowness to combine and organise, or when organised to use boldly their strength which afflicts the forces of the future. This is the main reason why still they hold the world, because there is nothing except at a point here and there which is confident of its own power to replace them. Their shakti is broken within, the shakti of the future is infirm without, that is why there is the deadlock. ——— The person who wrote is gone; I presume he will come again; but it seemed to me he is passing about swiftly seeking something or somebody that will receive his inspiration and do his will.

The process of the new birth is a very complicated and difficult thing offering at every step errors and perils of perversion and failure or else of fallings short of the idea, and the mind of man and still more his life impulses are so difficult and obstinate a material that it needs many influences and much labour behind the veil to give a fair chance to the possibilities of the future. This applies in every part of the work that has to"},{"pageNumber":1434,"pageContent":"1420 Record of Yoga be done, spiritual, intellectual, material. The movement is at first a chaos of possibilities and the thing that is to be done appears generally to the human idea in certain ideas and tendencies which become more and more general; but the difficulty is with the forces, to make them purer and clearer in their idea of action, to get them together, to give them a combination and mass of action. At present they are in a confusion which deprives them of their means of suc- cess. It is the second group whose action tends to grow stronger; but for the third to bring their work forward needs the intervention of a great precipitating force. It is that no doubt which was spoken of, but if it is coming, it is still in the background. That is a thing I can convey with difficulty, if at all. T S M is only a sign. Together the letters mean the three things, apart they mean nothing. T is the sign of the past that failed trying to throw itself into the present, S of the present taking up the past and trying to change it into the future, M of the future creating the present.

The Shakti always waits for the moment of the fitness of its advent and that must be ready in the psychical field before it can be ready in the material action. That is what he wanted to say. [7] My own plan is to be more and more full of light and seek the end of the whole place which is above the vital region. As for the tunnel I think that is a mere figure of speech. There can be no tunnel, only a path made through the resistance of the ether but that is a path of light running through the density of the space above the terrestrial level. ———— I am one who have worked on these things. Not the one who comes ordinarily at first when you begin to write. I put him aside when you took up the pencil. Not all, but I was passing when you talked of symbols.

No, but I mean that the question has only that solution. The change to be made is too great and the possibilities too many and complex for a plan to be made of any particular kind. It must be a natural evolution or if you like a natural revolution proceeding from the soul and will of the women themselves. If it is imposed on them in obedience to a previous idea, that will falsify the movement and produce something as artificial probably as the present system. Why? It seems to me the most practical process. In Asia. Europe will take, I think, a little time to adjust itself to a new impulse. It has been too much brought up to a sort of stand- still or rather a circling round the same point by the disappointment of the hopes it had concerning the after results of the war. Besides the forces there are too bewildered and uncertain of themselves to take boldly at once a step forward Even those which are sure of themselves are more concerned with consolidating their position than with any impulse of a fresh advance. Not yet, so far as I can see. There must be at least three stages passed before that can come. The first stage must be the exhaustion of the existing idea and movement which is rather a confused seeking for a means of self- effectuation than a strong and definite will and idea. And under the cover of this there must grow up a new will and strength fixed on its aim and luminous enough to create its means.

It is hanging all over Asia, but I do not know where it will break first. The enlargement of idea will, I believe, come of itself as the present immobile tension of circumstances breaks and new possibilities come into view. But that was not my seeing and I do not quite know what was in the mind of the spirit who spoke. He is more accustomed to the earth than I and probably has a more definite vision. At present, yes; even those who are in action cannot at present really get forward. This is everywhere a moment of blocked forces. Not only he, 1 but all who are at present politically active in India. In a year it will have been enough cleared up for new views to emerge. That is all I can say at present. The second phase, I take it, will come by the loss of faith in present ideas and methods among the younger men. As to who will represent it, that is a thing I cannot yet say; certainly a number of new men must come forward; the old are too much wedded to the past notions. This question is one which involves too much for an immediate answer. I can only say that the work which is to be done is to determine the new force that will make the India of the future. The removal of the foreign obstacle is only the removal of a negation, but there must be a positive creation which will be the beginning of the power that will govern the future, otherwise there will be so much weakness, confusion, aimless clash and dispersion of energies in this vast body that a rapid emergence of the greater future will not be possible. As to what work this or that person will do in this matter, that is a question difficult for me to answer without a consideration of many complex forces. I am not prepared to answer it at the moment. You want the time in which it will be completed? I am afraid I cannot say exactly. I can only say that as far [as] I can now see it will be in a few years quite visible.

I should say that it will"},{"pageNumber":1438,"pageContent":"1424 Record of Yoga be a good thing to establish the idea; for as the struggle proceeds, there will be great chances of India turning to it in the hope of an outside support and assistance. She has up till now been looking westwards. The present movement is turning her towards some kind of unity of feeling with western or Musulman Asia. The future may turn her eyes eastward towards the rest of Asia and your scheme will be useful in preparing for that time; there will be something to lay hold on immediately and that will save much time and effort which would otherwise then be needed to make a connection. Well, I dont know; it depends on getting over the present floating and uncertain state of action. If that can be done; there is obviously a big future, as it is a new idea with considerable possibilities of result and extension. I should say, certainly publish it. The more you publish the better.

That is nothing; such letters have no immediate meaning or importance, except as indications that many in the country feel a need of a leader and look this side. In my opinion it is best not to intervene in what others are doing for the moment, but leave the force at work to operate through its chosen instruments and confine yourselves to whatever special action is meant for you.

I speak of the personal mental part of it that still feels the effect of the life vibrations. —— That can only be done by the higher part of him. The part of his mind that is still concerned with the images of the outward world is likely for a time to act upon it through a certain impact on the men who are the channels of the general force that is working. It is only when these images fade and the consciousness becomes more free that the direct action of which you speak becomes probable. The action from the intermediate plane is in one sense stronger as it is capable of a more subtle and penetrating diffusion not hampered by the physical difficulties, but it has other difficulties of its own; it is strong for diffusion and the creation of impelling ideas and forces, but for the materialisation through human action it can only act in dependence on the transmitting agents. There is always a certain disparateness between the psychical and the physical planes and the transmission from the one to the other is not always facile That is true, but always in the sense of a primary force. In the end this primary force is the important thing. I only speak of the difficulty of correct materialisation from the psychical plane. A strong will can produce from it a great general effect in the sense of its purpose and that after all is the important matter. His psychic personality is composed of two parts, a higher soul which is the real man, a strong and brilliant soul of a great flight, and another which is the personality he works out in a certain round of lives and which gave the outward type of his human character and action. He is one of those who belong to the higher race, but has chosen to take on himself the burden of the lower for the help of the world action. (M r Tilak) Yes.

No, not a Rakshasa. There is a Rakshasa force associated with her, but it does not affect the centre of her being. (I) That is different. There are men who belong to one type and make an ascension, that is her case; there are others who have in themselves the various powers and have to transform them into the terms of the central unity. That I believe is yours. (P.R) To define your case is difficult. A Deva above, a strong Jnana Deva able to communicate with the higher planes, an Asura below representing the development of many lives, a Rakshasa force be- hind constantly weakened and fading, but not yet cast away by the drawing up of the vital being by the others, also several other minor deva kinds in the psychic being, that is the best I can manage. (Rapports avec la Soc. Theosoph) The fraternity is due to the fact that both are working out the common movement under a great superior direction. The hostility is due to the intermediate agencies. They are guided by inferior powers who are repelled and made afraid and therefore hostile by the superior force they at once feel in you; the greater intermediate powers that are behind you are not able to accommodate themselves to the narrowness of theirs and be sufficiently indulgent to their littleness. That is why there is the discord. There is a great deal of ignorance in that idea. Kutthumi and Maurya are merely names and forms, true only as a psychic symbol or an instrumental representation, of the two main powers that are behind them, one governing their thought, the other influencing their action. In Madame Blavatsky they found a sufficient instru- ment who could as it were incarnate and harmonise both their forces.

Kutthumi represents a Deva, not a Jnana Deva, but a certain kind of thought deva who responds with a limited light but a great abundance of curious thought formations to the greater Idea that comes from the supramental level. Maurya represents an Asura who has stopped short on the way to Devahood, a being of aggressive thought force and great vital vehemence, but of a very limited power in the true sense of the word, who has associated himself with Kutthumi and is tolerated by him, because otherwise Kutthumi would not be able to exercise an influence of practical action on the human world. (Rapports avec la T.S.) I doubt, unless the Maurya influence can be broken, but that would mean that the Society would l ose its practical force of action. It would have either to be transformed and taken up into a greater action or dissolve as a society and its members or the best of them enter into a work of larger inspiration and movement. That represented the hostility of which I spoke. The Maurya influence is a despotic power which does not want any interference with its control or any dissolvent action on the frame of thought and organised movement it has stamped on the society.

All I can say is that there is a great Light Devata there, but the other elements are not clear to my vision. It is easy to define the psychic personality of people like M r . s . Besant and Gandhi, but all your cases are different because of unusual or of complex elements of a considerable significance to which a short definition is not easily fitted. [10] Yes. I am here —————————— Tagore There is not much to say. It is evident that there is in him a double being, one for the higher part of him, another for the lower nature. The higher is a very large psychic devata living in the celestial beauty of his own soul; the other is a sort of Gandharva. The Gandharva is limited, ego-bound, psycho-nervous, but his ner- vous expansion is made limited and weak by the domination of the psychic devata. At the same time he limits the psychic devata who because of him cannot impress himself on life, as he could if he had a strong intermediary, and therefore can find himself only in the world of his own imagination, poetry, art, an ineffective idealism. He cannot be really a friend, because he lives only for his own psychic or nervous satisfaction and values people according as they minister to that. He may have sympathies, but they cannot take the active form necessary to friendship. Yes, because he cannot pour himself out in life. He is therefore drawn into a sort of imprisoning circle of his own ether of isolated personality. . The devata in his relations to life. It is not that the devata would not like to be in active unity with others, but he has not the means in the vital nature of the human being. That is first a sympathy of the psychic intelligence, secondly, the force of your own personality on him; it was not a thing deepseated in his own nature. You could still do the same thing with him if you were in constant relation with him, because he would like to be in action and would feel a support in the greater force that is around you; but as it is, it is not a thing that can be consistent and durable."},{"pageNumber":1444,"pageContent":"1430 Record of Yoga I should have to be in a little closer contact with them to do that effectively. As it is, I could only see through an intervening mist. The psychic image conveyed to me is not sufficiently precise and complete. There is, but I fancy it belongs more to the past than anything else. You have gone too much forward. It is the difficulty which meets all things that come from the future into the present and for which the powers of the present are not yet ready. In your case it is extremely strong in proportion as the idea and the force are large; if you were content with something smaller and more immediate, you would probably be much more effective. As it is, you come in advance of the godheads that are in march towards the actual world and you are too much beyond those who are actually at work at the moment. As yet you do not fit in and you have to create a place and a body for what is coming. But naturally the matter of the existing world is rebellious as it always is to things too great and new and not sufficiently prepared. The things you have formed in yourself need a greater outgoing force than they have at present in order to impress themselves sufficiently on the outside world. The momentum behind you is growing, but it is not yet sufficient. In these things those who create cannot see themselves where they are already effective, because the obstruction is greatest immediately around them; for they are the centre of the creation and therefore the centre of the accumulated resistance. Their thought and power work subtly, at a distance, through others, changed in those others to something less complete and characteristic which can mix with the actual material. That is to say, it is as mental influences that they work, but they do not take at once the recognisable form of which they can say, “This is the thing I mean, this is the actual creation I intend.” That can only be when they become the direct material creators. I do not know whether I make myself clear to you. It is difficult for me to say because I see the psychic better than the material things. In trying to make an inference from the former to the latter, I should probably commit many errors. The obstacle is general; it applies itself for the moment to any action you are likely to take, but if you can once break it"},{"pageNumber":1445,"pageContent":"Automatic Writings, c. 1920 1431 down effectively at one point, it is likely that others will open. My impression is that it will take you yet a little time to find the weak point of the obstruction and I myself cannot really tell. The obstruction is not something definite and rational, but a sheer force of obscurity and inertia which has somehow got itself concentrated in front for the time being. It is really a vital intuition enlightened by the higher mind which could find it out and that is a thing I necessarily lack in my present condition. Yes, it is true. These forces know nothing, but they are as it were attracted where there is something that threatens them and they take time to form. That also is true; India is a field where the opposing forces are most hostile to each other and there is besides a great complexity. If however the forces of the future can once form themselves effec- tively, they will get here perhaps their best chance of a direct and rapid action. That at least is one possibility on which certain very great Devatas are working. It was someone else who suggested that someone I think who is very sensitive to possibilities. It is true I believe that powers are at strenuous work to bring in a violent impetus and at moments it looks as if they would succeed, but the forces that make for an arrest direct themselves there and there is anew a deadlock. [11] I am here. — That is not very easy for me. I wish to be quite well con- nected with the terrestrial plane by communication first before I give out myself. If things are suggested to me, I can by an effort put myself in relation at particular points and so strengthen the connection. Otherwise I can only speak of things foreign to the terrestrial atmosphere. —— Russie I think that the formations there are of a kind too forceful to be steady. There is a violent pressure upon natural psychological forces to suppress some, to create others. The transformation attempted is of the nature of a scheme made in the mind and imposed on"},{"pageNumber":1446,"pageContent":"1432 Record of Yoga the life forces. This means that many of the life forces lie inert and unconverted and a constant renewal of currents [has] 4 to be made to galvanise things into effective action. If a constant struggle could be kept up with success with outside forces there would in time grow up a sufficiently steady and compact centre of transformation; but the Bolshevik motor force is at present a very small though powerful agent at once repressing a great inert mass and trying to use it for great and difficult work. That is a kind of action in which you must expect many crises and chances of failure. A failure anywhere means a retardation and a fresh expenditure of energy to start again. There is not the general excitement and vital enthusiasm that supported the French revolution. There is instead a more intelligent intellec- tual force and centre acting on a more complex and contradictory national psychology which is itself by no means strong either in intellectuality or in rapid vital energy. The experiment is most dif- ficult, the chances precarious, and the one great hope is that the hostile forces will go on blundering and give the Bolshevik centre each time leisure and opportunity to repair the results of misfortune and strengthen itself for good. That is all I can see in the matter. [12] All right That is a little outside my power of vision. Psychically the conditions seem to me favourable, I dont know about the material elements. . Cousins Yes. He is a soul of the middle regions, of what might be called the psychic and aesthetic world, associated with a very material being into which the soul has got rather thickly encased. There is an aesthetic devata enlightened by a Power of the intuitive intelligence, and its light burns inside and radiates through the material crust, but not with the free light that it might otherwise have. It gets free in the activities related to its own domain, but not even there quite free because it has had to educate the material mind and has not 4 MS have"},{"pageNumber":1447,"pageContent":"Automatic Writings, c. 1920 1433 been able to make it a quite flexible and spontaneous instrument. In other things it is subject to the limitations of the material being with whom it is associated and can only refine it to some extent without being able to change it. The intuitive Power works chiefly in that domain and is not sufficiently concerned or active in the rest. For him you can do much, but I dont know whether the material being will allow you. Still you can bring an influence on the intuitive Power in him to act on the whole intelligence, where it is still content to work in rather cramped bounds. This Power is a little indifferent to other things than the aesthetic and psychic, and if you can interest it sufficiently in a wider domain for it to break from its indifference, and that is quite possible, it is strong enough to compel the material mind to which it now leaves those things, to enlarge itself and become intuitive. There is likely however to be much passive resistance because there are other influences. As for the other question he can only help you in outward matters and that he can do very well if he is kept in close touch with you and his emotional being in active friendly relation. He is easily responsive to influences where this is the case. M me Cousins That has been a help to him, but as often happens is also a hindrance. She is stronger than him in will, for his will is not very strong, but not being very wide in mind this decisiveness of will makes her rigid in her intelligence. Of course, if she could be induced to move from her moorings he would move with her like a boat in tow with a steam launch, but she is not flexibly responsive to influences. [13] More times than one I was here, but you did not call me. —— No, because I depend on you for my connection with earth and I have nothing to say for myself any longer...

One has to take ones chance. I am here already. The thing I said last time I came that there was a storm preparing in Asia I can now explain more clearly. It is still preparing and it threatens the British Empire. Mesopotamia is one centre, India is the other. In India the electricity is gathering force and before long it will be the beginning of the end. — There are three stages to be gone through. The first begins now with the movement of non-cooperation which will develop into a movement of separation and independence. The second will be a formation of something corresponding to the Sinn Fein, but of a more carefully organised character. The third will be a final revolution which will at once end the British rule and break up the old India of the past. These three stages will follow rapidly on each other and even overlap to a certain extent, the last taking up the results of the two others —— The time I do not see clearly; but the flood of the present movement is likely to be three years, after which it will be replaced by the second. That may last a little longer. In any case all will be finished in ten years. Not long considering that the greater part of India is still ill- prepared even for this stage. The people have to be accustomed to shake off their habits of timidity and dependence and work boldly and avowedly for freedom. It is the office of the present movement to make this change and three years is by no means a long time if one considers the psychological revolution that is to be made. The Swadeshi movement lasted six years and changed only one or two provinces to a certain extent. This will last only three years and will change the whole of India. That is a question I cannot answer, for I am not in touch with your destinies. But so far as I can see from my present contact with you, the first stage is not the one for which anyone here can be"},{"pageNumber":1449,"pageContent":"Automatic Writings, c. 1920 1435 directly useful. For it will be too confused and indefinite. It is more probably the second that will demand your assistance. That I have not yet seen. . I think it depends on what happens in China. . Japan cannot be ready to help India until the state of things in the whole of the Far East is changed. If Japan and China are ready, there will probably be a great change in Indo China and then the whole Asiatic movement can link itself together through India. That can only bear fruit subsequently. It is essential first that India should form the clear idea of independence and then your League may be a standing suggestion to her to turn for help to the Far East. At present she is looking to the West and to Mahomedan Asia and does not imagine at all that anything can come to her from the Far East. If you establish it now, perhaps after two years it may begin to have a meaning for India beyond what it bears on the surface. That is all I had to say myself. I shall return another day —— [14] 290 (le nombre d ˆ etres en moi) My knowledge does not go so far as to explain the number in each being. The proportion varies for each man, although there are possible classifications. Each man is unique being a centre of the possibilities of the infinite. The proportions remain the same through life for beings of a certain order of development who change only within a certain settled framework as a preparation for subsequent existences; it is variable in natures which admit of considerable enlargements and changes. There are four orders in the ordinary human nature, mental, psychic, nervous, physical; four in the superior or superconscient nature. It is probably to the four human orders that the 290 belong; the physical are few in comparison; it is the three others that are most complex. All I can say is that it is a very complex calculation and I see the figures 7, 6, 7, 6, 3, recurring. I must take a little time to see if I can see farther. Probably the 7 includes both the psychic and mental and the 6 refers to the nervous being. In that case there will be two orders"},{"pageNumber":1450,"pageContent":"1436 Record of Yoga each of the number 40 (four tens) in the mental, and of 30 (three tens) in the psychic, and of 60 (six tens) in the nervous, and only ten orders of 3 each in the physical. I do not yet see to what the orders correspond. You must remember that the physical has to bear the impact of the others. Therefore, however obscure they may be, thirty is not too much for the physical being. The two orders on each plane must be the right hand and the left hand powers. The right hand are those who open upward so as to admit the influences from above and shape them for the being; the left hand are those who open downward to the world here and the actualised experience and send them up to the higher planes. That at least is the division which seems to me to correspond best in the arrangement. That is quite different; it belongs to a more mystic truth of which I have not the key. Is there not something in the Hebrew or the Chaldean mysteries which might shed light on it? It may be that that belongs to some secret potentiality or totality in the four superconscient planes which seek to realise themselves on the four human levels. No, I dont think it has anything to do with the number of beings; it is something more recondite, more symbolic. Chandra This is a very easy question. The girls psychical being is entirely concentrated upon the nervous life and there she has an immense but undeveloped force. Given certain favourable circumstances of education, social surroundings etc she could have been one of the notable enchantresses of men who draw not by physical beauty but by nervous magnetism and the secret charm of the psychical being behind, but she has fallen into the wrong forms of life and this has not been developed. However the psychical being with its potentialities is there and it is that he has felt and that attracts him. Behind all that is a spirit with a very powerful will, but it is behind the veil and what comes out from it is wasted on small and trivial things. If that spirit could be roused to break the veil and come into the front, then she would be a fitting mate for him and"},{"pageNumber":1451,"pageContent":"Automatic Writings, c. 1920 1437 supply much that he needs for his own fullness. That too probably the soul in him vaguely feels though it is not known to the mind, and that enters into the strength of his attraction for her. But if he cannot do this, then the attraction will fail and they will separate. I believe they have met in former lives and past connections explain the swiftness of their drawing together. M lle Chattopadhyay (Mrinalini) This is a soul of a very high order though not of the highest. A great psychic being is there behind, whose stamp has determined the whole turn of the nature. This being has a strong spiritual inspiration of which the human mind in her is vaguely conscious; but because the higher experience has not taken shape, it could not become the ruling note in the life or the nature. The next strongest thing is the emotional mind which is one of an extraordinarily intense capacity, acute and poignant in all its movements but held in by the intelligence. It is still in the emotions that she lives and they are of a great spontaneity, sincerity, clarity and strength. The intelligence is a lesser force, but well trained and developed and it is the influence again of the psychic being that has given it a literary and artistic turn. There is a suppleness and fineness in the nature proceeding from the same source. The one thing wanting is the discovery of her spiritual self; she has not yet found herself, but has spent her gifts on the things of the mind and heart, and she is conscious of the want in her. If once she completes herself, the full beauty and power of the psychical devata in her will appear and she may do a considerable work for the social and cultural change in India, her real mission in life, a work more solid than any that can be done by any of her brothers or sisters. This is a view a little from the outside. The things behind I cannot tell properly today, because I have externalised myself excessively in my effort to get into touch with the outer existence [15] The spirit who ordinarily comes is not here. I have taken his place —— He has gone into the region of the pranic worlds which is near"},{"pageNumber":1452,"pageContent":"1438 Record of Yoga to the earth. He is drawing around him pranic forces for his next birth. At the same time he will probably come if you continue the writing. . I am the son of the middle heavens who have often descended on the earth. I am a frequent messenger to earth of the gods of the middle heaven. There are three heavens of the gods who work on the mind from the heights of the mental world. The first is the heaven of the mind which is in tune with the infinite, the second or middle heaven that of the luminous mental determinations, the third of the origination of mental forms. I have no special message for you; for the action which I repre- sent affects the work you are seeking to do only by a sort of oblique injection of its powers and suggestions. It is not in the direct line of descent; that concerns others. Therefore I leave you to put your own questions. Yes. My work of mentality is different. It is not concerned with the actualities of the psychic plane. Await the coming of the other for that question. I can only tell you certain possibilities of his nature, not his actual psychic condition. But it is better to know his actual condition and then the possibilities will take their proper value. At present they may seem too much in the air without their proper foundation. I have returned. — Chokra = Ramaiah This is a difficult question to answer, because there is so much that is undeveloped; there are not the clear, certain and vivid forms which I found in the others. . What I see are certain things behind that have not yet their full representation in the surface nature. There is a strong psychic, a strong pranic being associated with the nature, a mental which is very active but has not found its means of self expression in the mind. The difficulty is in some knot of the physical birth producing a physical consciousness which is unequal to the powers of the soul and a life cast into circumstances that are still more in conflict with"},{"pageNumber":1453,"pageContent":"Automatic Writings, c. 1920 1439 the greater potentialities. There is behind an urge and insistent will of seeking demanding a work, an association, a knowledge, any- thing which will help the soul to break out from its covering sheath of the physical consciousness. But the fixities that are established by the outward being are not as yet the right forms that are wanted for his real self to emerge. They are only tentative determinations to which the stress of the urge behind gives a certain ardent and eager character. If the coverings can be broken, the powers behind will reveal their true strength. As far as I can see, it is the mental that is the strongest obstacle. The nervous and the psychic will find their own proper develop- ment if he finds his right mind and way of action. Let him by whatever means open up his mentality, so that the soul may have a chance. The obstacle is in the formed nature, the result of past circumstances; if that is allowed to govern, it will never, however he educates it, give an open field to the soul. . He may make some progress, but not realise in this life the true soul possibilities. He must break boldly the limits of the formed mental nature and let the soul powers flood out into the consciousness. That is the one way for him as it is for many others who are in a similar case I continue. . N.P.K. Kalappa. 5 This is a clearer nature. . In front is a lesser mental devata with a strong and brooding will through whom all the main soul currents come. The nervous and psychic are governed by beings who hold back until this devata has found the way for the nature. I see him very clearly. It is like a low burning red flame which grows more and more intense, supporting a shaft of golden light. Behind is a greater deva of knowledge and will who will only come forward if the lesser being succeeds in opening the way. A psychic being with great psychic power and a large emotional scope is also waiting for the same decisive movement. This much I can see for the present. Here too the problem is a development of the outward consciousness into a sufficient instrument or rather channel; but 5 This name and the next were apparently written by the individuals concerned. Ed."},{"pageNumber":1454,"pageContent":"1440 Record of Yoga the obstacle here is only a comparative narrowness of the channel owing to a blocking up by received ideas and mental habits and the obstacle is one of no great force, easily removed if a purifying flood of light can be poured into the channel. That I cannot tell you. It depends on your bringing forward of your powers. I have no sufficient view of the future. Ka. Neela Kantaiyar. Here the power of the nature is psychic-intellectual; the presid- ing devata of the being sends down only an influence which turns into a seeking without a definite orientation. The activity has been governed by an intermediate being who is psychic with a turn to a curious action of the intelligence. The being has not in this case been concentrated round this governing action. There is in it a turn to a larger seeking. There are in this case too greater powers who can come forward if the chance is given. The presiding devata is one with a rainbow light around him, but there is a shaft of white descending on it from above. The psychic is of a very ruddy rose light. These are the two chief powers behind the veil of the physical consciousness. [16] 30 corps physiques Yes, I am here. — The thirty are three tens. They are those who support the physical consciousness, not the physical body alone, but the ob- scurer consciousness of which it is the visible representation. In this consciousness there are three layers, one which receives the mental impressions and store[s] them in the corporeal system, so that it responds to a sum of habitual mental sanskaras; the second, which similar[ly] responds to the vital and preserves the habit of replying to habitual vital impulses, the third of a more purely material kind. These beings are not intelligent, but obscure and fixed in their habits. When a change has to be made, it is they who are the last support to a resistance to the change, but also if they can be made to reply to new things, they help to make them fixed in the physical consciousness and thus to assure their stability."},{"pageNumber":1455,"pageContent":"Automatic Writings, c. 1920 1441 Yes; only the number may vary.

The present Puranas are very late creations with many ancient things imbedded in them and mixed with much of a recent creation. No, but the traditions they contain are often older than the extant Veda. I could hardly say. There is much that has survived from old civilisations that have perished, but of course in a changed form. One would have to count their origin perhaps by tens of thousands of years. There are things also that were believed in old times, forgotten and again recovered from the mental planes. It is difficult to disentangle the various materials and say which dates from what time. The theory of the Kalpas has existed in one form or another from times lost in the mist of oblivion. I composed many things, but they are not extant. Vyasa is a name under which many different people have been confused together. If you mean Krishna Dwaipayana, he is some- where in the planes of being which are at the height of what may be called the mental heavens. They cannot be numbered. Besides these existed through cen- turies after centuries in long generations of Rishis. The seven Rishis are a tradition. The original seven Rishis refer to seven personalities who did not belong to the earth. The seven of tradition have not been on the earth since the Vedic times. I know nothing about the White Lodge. I should fancy they belong to the lower worlds between the pranic and the mental. They are certainly not the Vedic Rishis though the name given to one of them is that of a later Rishi of the times of the Upanishads. Yes. I do not think it is the same; but I cannot say certainly, for I do not know where Kutthumi is. The best thing, I should imagine, would be to get them to enlarge their Theosophy by bringing in a current of new and up- ward pointing ideas; but that could not be done without either starting from their present ideas as a valid point of departure or breaking their framework and the latter would not be tolerated while the present control existed. It is rather through some kind"},{"pageNumber":1457,"pageContent":"Automatic Writings, c. 1920 1443 of communication and indirect i nfluence that they could be helped, but I could not say exactly how. If anything is possible, it will spring out of circumstances and individual relations. There are many ways of changing, but the most common is by a pressure from above. All that develops in the mental, psychic, vital has an influence which is precipitated into the obscure physical consciousness and works there more or less slowly. Certain slight changes are always being produced, others of a more important kind occasionally. The physical beings receive these influences and assimilate them in the already established physical consciousness and there make of them a sure basis for the mental, psychic and vital habits. These change decisively in proportion as they can get the guardians of the physical consciousness to accept and support them. A great force of will from above can sometimes make abrupt changes. But ordinarily the movement is more or less slow and within well established limits. Outside these limits these beings of- fer a strong resistance to any change, unless it confines itself to the higher activities. In proportion as a great change of mental thought for instance tries to affect the vital and physical being, the opposi- tion becomes strong and is usually obstinate. It is sometimes rapidly overborne, sometimes can only be obtained 7 byaslowprocessof transformation in the sanskaras of the physical beings. All this is in the ordinary kind of development. It is only if there is a great influx of power from above the mental that very extraordinary changes can usually be made. In that case the physical beings are some- times overpowered, sometimes enlightened, sometimes rejected and replaced by others. It must however be noted that abnormal changes of a purely physical kind are a different matter. They are the most difficult to accomplish. For there [these] 8 physical beings are in their own domain and exercising their strongest right which is to prevent any violent change in the organised habits of physical Nature.

That is part of the process of the great crises of evolution. He would either be taken up into some higher part of the being and form an element of Rudra force in the totality without being any longer active as a separate element of the personality, or else, if he remained as a separate part of the personality, he would be a sort of enlightened and passive instrument for the Purusha with a view to a certain divine action of a kind it is difficult to describe. There would be a divine use of the Rakshasa force changed from a nervous egoism to a sort of powerful dynamic utility on that plane, just as the animal power in the body might be divinely used for the greater purposes of the divinised Purusha. [18] The last time I was near the earth, this time I am beginning to withdraw. I think before long I must depart to prepare during a sufficiently long period for my rebirth among men. Yes; but an interval of preparation is necessary during which I must gather forces on the intermediary planes. After that I shall have again to enter into relation with the material plane, but of course in a different way, and gather powers and influences of the earth to form my earthly basis of personality, mind, life and body.

I shall be one who brings from that ancient past a power of realisation which shall enrich the elements of the new mankind. If this is not enough, then you may easily know me by seeing in vision the form of what I was renewed though changed in the form of my new body. A seer with knowledge can know the identity of one he sees even though not known before to the physical mind. It will be begun. That is not necessary. That I should be directly descended. No; I have not the physical vision. It is not always easy to see from a distance, and if I depend on any of you, I may be too much influenced by your impressions. I cannot say, certainly; but I think you are having too fixed and limited ideas about the matter. There will be, I think, not one, but several centres, and the whole thing will be of a fluid character before there is any decisive formation. I should say, do not fix things beforehand, but let the force that descends have freedom of movement, the freedom as of waters descending and flowing in many directions, afterwards the solid formation. My opinion is of no great value in that matter. The progress in these matters comes usually in two ways; either by a violent conver- sion which changes in a short time the whole direction of the nature, or by a slow and difficult process with many movements and rever- sions in which the progress made can only be estimated after a lapse of time by something having disappeared after alternate returns and weakenings or something new having been formed which attempts to come, then disappears, then comes again until it has made its foothold. Possibly, the effort in you has not decidedly taken either course, or it has attempted the first method and, failing, fallen back on the slower movement. I cannot say really, because it depends on a power which is not the psychical and which in your case is hidden behind a veil. In such cases, the outward signs are deceptive. Dont put it in that form, because so put it is an already existing idea and attracts around it many difficulties.

The pain of descent and self-limitation and loss of self in the body. Always the other planes are freer than the material; birth is usually a sacrifice. Yes; they have the desire; but the fulfilment of the desire still involves a sacrifice. Yes, a compression, that is the word. Because I shall descend with a fuller consciousness and with the impulse that makes the superman. A greater Shakti will support me. I cannot explain all the process, but I know it will be so. Death is usually a struggle. The struggle to get out of the compression is often as painful as the effort to get into it. But to some death is easy. He may have in the end many ways, but the physical birth will continue. . The superman will take all the ways that are necessary for the divine design in the evolution; if physical birth ceases to be a part of the plan, it will for him discontinue; but there will be no other reason for him to avoid it. Make your question more precise. No, it must be prepared in actual man. It can come by a rapid change, a decisive descent of the divine supermind into the human being. It would be impossible for them to be born in the monkey except by a miraculous descent of the thinking mind into the life mind of the animal. How do you suppose a human couple to be suddenly born of a couple of monkeys?

Suppose, an effort of Nature in certain individuals of the kind breaking a barrier between the animal mind and the secret greater mind which is subliminally brooding there in Nature, so that there is the influx I speak of, to however limited an extent. There is the seed man. Suppose a progression, more and more effort of progress, more and more result both of mental development and physical change. The lower kinds which are only a bridge, neither animals, nor complete men, disappear; the full basis of man is established. After that the real human progress. May it not so have happened? [19] The last time I made a mistake. It is only after the second month of the next year that I retire from the earth proximity. I imagined that a certain necessary development would proceed more quickly than it has actually done. No, I have not met him. In any case the photograph by it- self would tell me little. The fields of the psychic world are too numerous for meetings of this kind to be common, especially be- tween souls descending to renew their touch with earth and others ascending and recently come from it. I dont quite seize the question. What two kinds of the Divine? There are many aspects, infinite movements, but I do not catch the distinction you make, I mean the exact significance of what you mean. The Bhakta pure is limited, so is the man of intelligence. But knowledge can mount to the unknown and manifest it, so too can love or Ananda mount to the unseized and bring it down into manifestation. It is the power of the soul that matters, not so much the way; that is to say, I cannot say that one way is superior to the other. A greater completeness is always superior to a lesser complete- ness; but also an extreme power of one can do miracles. . Be wise as a serpent and mild as a dove. It is a possible approach, but it wants intuition and a happy seizing of occasion to deal with these people. What I would suggest"},{"pageNumber":1462,"pageContent":"1448 Record of Yoga is to take hold of them by the strong side of Theosophy and not to press too much on the weak side. People attached to a fixed and traditional thinking for it has become traditional with them have not usually the open nature which can bear exposure of the weakness of what they believe in. One or two may profit by that method, the most will react in a hostile fashion. On the other hand if the strong side is seized and broadened to its real issues, they may be led without knowing it to enlarge themselves and meet with a good disposition the atmosphere of larger thought you bring them. This reception is needed, because it is the difference of the two atmospheres that is likely to be a stumbling block. The second thing is if you can make a link with them through the active side of their ideas. The outer side of the practical idea you have is favourable from this standpoint, because it can easily be used as a means to bring out the broader side of their own principles of action. The ulterior motive has to be kept in the shadow for the present; a time may come when they will receive it, but that will be after the present dominating influence in the society has receded. The third thing is to mix mainly on the one hand with the larger, on the other with the simpler and more candid minds among them; leave aside those who are in between. Be careful with M r . s . Besant; she is a difficult and deceptive personality. The strong side is first their seeking after truth, which is con- stantly moving near things that are true without quite seizing them; the weak side is the imaginations, fancies and rigid formulas which they build up like a wall between the truth and their search. If you read their books, or listen to their ideas with patience, you will easily be able to distinguish the two elements and bring out what I call the strong side. Then there are their larger ideas which admit truth in all religions and many philosophies and their attempt to find a principle of unity for men of all races and peoples, etc. There is much else which one can seize with advantage if one is in their company and comes to know what is behind this movement of theosophy. .

Probably she will be very busy and you need not see too much of her. Only see her when you are yourself in a good mood. She is psychically sensitive in a certain fashion and when well impressed psychically can be openminded up to a certain degree.

There are minor objects of Yoga which are merely parts or separate aspects of the general object. We are composed of being, consciousness, energy and delight represented to us as life, knowledge, force and power, emotion, sensation and desire. The object of Yoga is to turn all these things towards God. Therefore to become one with God, to be Divine and live a Divine Life is the first object of Yoga. The second is to know God in Himself and in ourselves and in everything. The third is to make ourselves one with the Divine Will and to do in our life a Divine Work by means of the Divine Power using us as an instrument. The fourth object is to enjoy God in all beings, in all things and in all that happens. Since the Life is to be Divine there must be siddhi or Perfection of the Being.

Therefore we have to get rid of the Ego in order to be Divine. Ego persists because of thre e things; first because we think we are the body; secondly because of desire; and thirdly because of the mental idea that I am a separate being existing in my own mind and body independently of everything and everybody else. We have therefore to know ourselves, to realise that we are not the body, nor the Prana, nor the mind and to find out our real Self . That is called Atmajnana. Secondly we have to get rid of the idea of ourselves and others as separate being to realise everything as one Brahman or one Purusha or Ishwara m anifesting himself in different names and forms. This Self and the Brahman or Ishwara are the same. We have to know what it is, how it manifests itself in the world and beings that we see. All this we have to realise in our experience and not merely know by the intellect. We have to realise It as Sachchidananda and to become that ourselves. Thirdly we have to get rid of desire and replace it by the Ananda of Sachchidananda. After that in order to live and act in the world we have to act as mere instruments so the Divine Force which we must realise as the sole Power which acts in the world and we must get rid of the idea that actions are ours or that the fruit of the action belongs to us personally. The only work we have to do in the world is to perfect ourselves, carry out whatever the Divine Power wills that we should do and so far as possible help others to perfect themselves and help the life of humanity to become Divine. [7] Methods of Yoga (Reproduction from memory) 2 The first two things necessary for the practice of Yoga [are] 3 Will and Abhyasa. In the course of Yoga these two things give helping hands to the perfection of the being unto the very end.

Be we unconscious of them, it will take a pretty long time to attain to that perfection. But once we are conscious, then we become the Will itself. Consciously we can quicken the progress. This method gives rise to individual perfected beings. As before, they will not see glimpses of the Light of Truth. They will ever be seeing the Eternal Truth. They will turn the darkness around them and in them, into Light. Hitherto, we should have felt a certain amount of difficulty in putting into Abhyasa what we have willed. Now there will be no more putting into Abhyasa but simply we will be seeing the march of progress without the least idea of strain felt by us. So first let us will in order to be not weak and unconscious but strong and conscious. Then there will be no more difficulty. Until then we have to practise Yoga by two important means by means of Purusha and by means of Prakriti. Means of Purusha: An ordinary man thinks he desires, he feels and so on. But what we are to do is to separate ourselves from desire, feeling etc. Whenever desire comes, we must realise that we are not desiring but only realise it as the coming and going of Desire. So also with the feeling, thinking etc. For instance, when [a] certain anguish comes, an ordinary man thinks and feels that he is lost and so on. He weeps bitterly and reduces himself to a mere crawling worm. We have to think that that anguish is a kind of action or reaction, going on in the heart. Anguish cannot affect me. I am the unsullied Self; it cannot touch me. Means of Prakriti: Whenever the thinking part of man is ac- tive, we notice very clearly that the work is going on in a place somewhere above the forehead. The action is centred in the heart, when the feelings are awake in him. In both the cases, the self takes the heart and mind for its theatre of action. In the one case, we are those thoughts and in the other, we are those feelings. Putting this in plain words, our actions proceed either from the heart or from the mind, while the actions of the animals proceed from the senses. We see the vast difference between an animal and a man. So if man transfers his centre of heart and mind, to that of a higher one, think how grand the God-man would be! That centre accord- ing to the psychology of the Hindus is Vijnana. This is just above"},{"pageNumber":1480,"pageContent":"1466 Record of Yoga the crown of [the] head. This is known as Sahasradala or the place where the Shakti is situated. From this seat of activity, all actions emanate. Therefore the first Sadhana is not to feel ourselves either in the heart or in the mind but there just above the crown of [the] head. By these two means, we separate ourselves from body, life and mind. On account of this, misery cannot affect us and we will be above happiness and misery. Apart from all these, the main thing we effect thereby is, we will be in a position henceforward, to become one with the Brahman and to realise that everything is Brahman and everything is only one of the several forms, names and colours etc., of that one Vast Brahman. Whenever we see people walking along the road, we will no more see them as several different beings but as several forms of one vast undivided Brahman. As [a] rose is the manifestation of form, colour, odour so the Brahman is the manifestation of so many things we perceive by the senses and think by the mind etc. Along with these, we must put into practice one after the other what we are going to see hereafter as the Sapta Chatusthayas. They are namely Samata, Shakti, Vijnan a, Sharira, Karma, Brahman and Siddhi Chatusthayas. Chatusthayas means four divisions. These seven Chatusthayas have been arranged in their natural and logical order. But it is not required of you to get them in practice in this given order. One may begin with a chatusthaya which [one] finds to be easier and in this way he is expected to practise.

Disturbance is caused [by] 1 the want of harmony between the Chit-shakti in myself and the contacts of Chit-shakti outside. Pain, grief, dislike etc. are merely the systems way of saying that it objects to a particular contact because of want of harmony. The system cannot bear an inharmonious contact or even a pleasant one if it is too intense or too prolonged. Disgust, fear, horror, shame are attempts of the system to repel the unpleasant contact and defend itself. Titiksha means the power of endurance.

[The] result of complete Samata is complete Shanti; on the other hand if there is any touch of anxiety, grief, disappointment, depression etc., it is a sign that Samata is not complete. When we get complete Shanti, then we get complete Sukham. Shanti is negative; it is a state of freedom from trouble. Sukham is positive; it is not merely freedom from grief and pain, but a positive state of happiness in the whole system. Atmaprasada is a state of clearness, purity, contentment in the whole self, i.e. [the] essence of Sukham. When Sukham begins to become strong Ananda, then it is Hasya, a state of positive joy and cheerfulness which takes the whole of Life and the world as a pleasant andamusingplay. II. Shakti Chatusthaya Viryam, Shakti, Daivi Prakriti, Sraddha Viryam: Chaturvarnya in guna Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra Brahmana: Dhairyam, Jnanalipsa , Jnanaprakasha, Brahmavar- chasya. Shakti is the right guna and right state of activity or right elements of shakti-character in all parts of the system. The chaturvarnya in guna may be called Virya. It is the qualities of the four varnas in charac- ter. The perfect man has all the four in him, although one usually predominates and gives the character its general type. First, a man should have Brahmana qualities, [those of] 2 the man of knowledge. He should have, first, the general temperament of the Brahmin, that is to say calmness, patience, steadiness and thoughtfulness, which may all be expressed by the word Dhairyam. Then he should have the 2 MS (scribal) or"},{"pageNumber":1483,"pageContent":"Sapta Chatusthaya Scribal Version 1469 tendency towards knowledge, especially the Divine Knowledge, but also all kinds of knowledge on all kinds of subjects, with the necessary mental openness and curiosity. This is Jnanalipsa. The Brahmin has not only the thirst for knowledge but also a general clearness of mind and its tendency to be easily illuminated by ideas and to receive the truth. This is Jnanaprakasha. He has also a spiritual force which comes from knowledge and purity. This is Brahmavarchasya. Kshatriya: [Abhaya, Sahasa], 3 Yasholipsa, Atma Shakti (Atma Slagha) There should also be the qualities of the Kshatriya, the qualities of the man of action or the fighter. The first of these is courage and it is of two kinds Abhaya or passive courage which is alarmed by no danger and shrinks from no peril that offers itself and from no misfortune or suffering. The second is Sahasa or active courage, that is to say, the daring to undertake any enterprise however difficult or apparently impossible and carry it through in spite of all dangers, suffering, failures, obstacles and oppositions. For this, two other things are necessary. [First,] a tendency of the nature to insist on the battle and victory and effort and triumph, i.e. Yasholipsa. Secondly, there must be a strong self-confidence and a high idea of the power that is in ones self. This is Atma Shakti or Atma Slagha. Vaishya: Vyaya, Kaushala, Dana, Bhogalipsa The Vaishya qualities are also nece ssary for action and enjoyment. The first is the readiness to spend labour, resources, materials, means and life itself quite freely, taking great risks of loss in order to secure great gains. This may be called Vyaya. But with this there must be skill in the use of means and methods and their proper disposition in order to secure the end and also the knowledge of what is or is not possible to be gained by a particular means or method or a particular expense. There should be a sense of proportion, of order, and a skill [in] 4 arrangement and management. Al l this may be called Kaushala. Also in the use of ones possessions, there are two other qualities of [the] Vaishya which are necessary. [First there must be] the readiness 3 MS (scribal) Courage 4 MS (scribal) and"},{"pageNumber":1484,"pageContent":"1470 Record of Yoga to give no less than to receive and to share with the world what one gets from the world. This is [the] 5 nature of love as it is ordinarily practised; [this] 6 giving and receiving may be called Dana. And then there should be a tendency to enjoy, i.e. Bhogalipsa. Shudra: [Kama, Prema,] Dasyalipsa, Atmasamarpana. The qualities of the Shudra are no less important. The Vaishya has the spirit of order, opposition and interchange. The Shudra has the spirit of service. Service is governed by two motives: first desire or kama, secondly love or prema. In t he perfect man, Kama should take the form of an interest in the bodily well-being of the world and a wish to see that physically it lacks nothing. Love in [the] Shudra is not like that of [the] Vaishya, for it seeks no return. It is governed by the third quality of the Shudra, the desire to serve and this in the perfect man becomes the desire to serve God-in-all. This is Dasyalipsa. The perfection of the Shudra nature is in self-surrender, the giving of ones self without demanding a return. This is Atmasamarpana. The nature of the Brahmana is knowledge, of the Kshatriya force and courage, of the Vaishya skill in works, and of the Shudra self- giving and service. The perfect character possesses all of these; for they are necessary for the perfect action. Shakti Shakti is a general force by which each of the four parts of the system (the body, the Prana, the Chitta and the Buddhi) is kept at its highest state of perfection. The perfect state of the body consists in four things, a sense of entire lightness (Laghuta), a sense of strength and energy (Balam), a sense of [a] certain mass and force (Mahattwa) and the power of containing without strain or reaction any working however intense and constant, of energy however great and [puissant]. 7 This is Dharana Samarthyam. The perfect state of Prana consists in a sense of fullness of vital force (Purnata), of general clearness and cheerfulness (Prasannata), of equality in all experiences, shocks and contacts (Samata), and in the 5 MS (scribal) a 6 MS (scribal) a 7 MS (scribal) possible"},{"pageNumber":1485,"pageContent":"Sapta Chatusthaya Scribal Version 1471 capacity to take all enjoyment of the world without desire but also without exhaustion and satiety. This is Bhoga Samarthyam. The perfect state of Chitta consists in a sense of richness and gladness of feeling (Snigdhata), of abounding moral power and energy (Tejas), in a confidence [in the] 8 divine grace and help and general sense of mangala (Kalyana Sraddha) and in the capacity for unbounded love for all beings and all objects. This is Prema Samarthyam. The perfect state of Buddhi consists in a general purity and clearness of [the] thinking faculty (Vishuddhata and Prakasha); in rich- ness and great variety and minuteness of the perceptions ([Vichitra] 9 Bodha); and in the power of the mind to receive and adapt itself to any kind of knowledge without feeling anywhere a limit or an incapacity. This is Jnana Samarthyam. Daivi Prakriti (Divine Nature) This means the possession of the four Shaktis Maheshwari, the Shakti of greatness and knowledge; Mahakali, the Shakti of force and violence; Mahalakshmi, the Shakti of beauty, love and delight; and Mahasaraswati, the Shakti of worldly reason (science) and work. The possession of these Shaktis carries with it a sense of the Divine Power, of general compassion [and] helpfulness to the world, and of faculty for any work that [the] nature may undertake.

Vijnana Chatusthaya Jnanam (Divine thought), Trikaladrishti, Ashta Siddhi, Samadhi Jnanam: The mental action consists of four parts: first of all, per- ception of the object and comparison and contrast with other objects. [Then] 10 reasoning about the objects. J udgment whether the reasoning 8 MS (scribal) of 9 MS (scribal) Vichar 10 MS (scribal) The"},{"pageNumber":1486,"pageContent":"1472 Record of Yoga is right or not. And judgment is aided by memory and imagination. Judgment is a direct perception of the Truth, which may or may not be aided by reasoning and other helps. Imagination is the power of presenting to yourself things or truths not actually perceived or established by reason, [of] 11 seeing possibilities other than actual experience. Memory is the power of retaining and reproducing mental or sensory impressions. Judgment has two parts discernment and direct perception. In the mind both of them are uncertain. In the Vijnana, there is a faculty of discernment called Viveka or Intuitive Discrimination, which sees at once what is wrong and what is right, the real difference between things and also their real resemblances and identities and also how far a truth is true and how far it has to be qualified. This Viveka is independent of reasoning. It knows the fact directly but not by a mere instinct; it knows it luminously with a clear perception which is certain and makes no mistake. There is also a faculty of Vijnana called Intuition which does the work of reasoning without the necessity of reasoning to arrive at a conclusion; that is to say it [comes to] 12 the conclusion not as a conclusion from other facts but as a fact in itself. Afterwards, it can group around that fact all the other facts not as reasons but as related facts which help to retain it. Inspiration is called Sruti or Hearing because it is not the direct sight of the Truth but a sort of coming of the Truth into the mind in a sudden flash. Generally this Truth comes as a vibration which carries the Truth in it and sometimes it comes as the actual word which by revealing its meaning brings new truth to the mind. The fourth faculty is Drishti or direct sight. This is not, like in- tuition, looking into a person, an object or a group of circumstances and finding out the truth about them, but it is the vision of the Truth itself, coming as a luminous thought i ndependent of all circumstances, objects etc. You must first of all get the Intuition and Discrimination to take up 11 MS (scribal) with 12 MS (scribal) does"},{"pageNumber":1487,"pageContent":"Sapta Chatusthaya Scribal Version 1473 the ordinary work of mind, because they alone among the Vijnana fac- ulties can give all the circumstances about the Truth. Otherwise Drishti and Sruti [will be distorted], because the reason will try to interpret them in the light of the circumstances as they are understood rightly or wrongly by the human mind. Even the Intuition and Discrimination will be at first distorted by the action of the reason, imagination, wrong judgment, wrong memory etc. Intuition and Discrimination have to go on working and getting stronger and surer until they are able to clear out from the mind the other activities and themselves take up the whole work. As they increase in Force and Light, the other two will begin to act of themselves. When these four faculties or any of them are applied to the things of thought, ideas and knowledge generally it may be called Jnanam or Divine Thought. When these four faculties are applied to the facts and events of the material world the result is Trikaladrishti, which means the direct knowledge of the past, the intuitive knowledge of the presen t and the prophetic knowledge of the future. To have it properly, it is necessary that there should be no desire or personal interest in the result or any trusting to reasoning, inferences, speculation etc. Ashta Siddhi There are two siddhis of knowledge, three of power and three of being. All siddhis exist already in Nature. They exist in you. Only owing to habitual limitations you make a use of them which is me- chanical and limited. By breaking t hese limitations, one is able to get the conscious and voluntary use of them. The three siddhis of being are siddhis of the Sat or pure substance. In matter, Sat uses these siddhis according to fixed laws but in itself it is free to use them as it chooses. If one can get partly or entirely this freedom, one is said to have these three siddhis. They are Mahima including Garima, second Laghima and third Anima. Sat manifests as Chit, pure consciousness, and Chit has two sides consciousness and energy, that is to say knowledge and power. Consciousness in one material being communicates with the same consciousness in another materia l being by certain fixed methods such as speech, gesture, writing etc. and unconscious mental communica- tion. But these limitations are mere habits [and other methods are"},{"pageNumber":1488,"pageContent":"1474 Record of Yoga possible,] as for instance ants communicate by touch and not by speech. Consciousness in itself is free to communicate between one mind and another without physical means consciously and voluntarily. The two siddhis by which this is done are called Vyapti and Prakamya. In the same way there is a power in the consciousness of acting upon other conscious beings or even upon things without physical means or persuasion or compulsion. Great men are said to make oth- ers do their will by a sort of magnetism, that is to say there is a force in their words, in their action, or even in their silent will or mere presence which influences and compels others. To have these siddhis of power is to have the conscious and voluntary use of this force of Chit. The three powers are Aishwarya, Ishita, Vashita. These powers can only be entirely acquired or safely used when we have got rid of Egoism and identified ourselves with the infinite Will and the infinite Consciousness. They are sometimes employed by mechanical means, e.g. with the aid of Mantras, Tantric Kriyas (special processes), etc. Vyapti is when the thoughts, feelings etc. of others or any kind of knowledge of things outside yourself are felt coming to the mind from those things or persons. This is the power of receptive Vyapti. There is also a power of communicative Vyapti, when you can send or put your own thought, feeling etc. into someone else. 13 Prakamya is when you look mentally or physically at some- body or something and perceive what is in that person or thing, thoughts, feelings, facts about them etc. There is also another kind of Prakamya which is not of the mind but of the senses. It is the power of perceiving smells, sounds, contacts, tastes, lights, colours and other objects of sense which are either not at all per- ceptible to ordinary men or beyond the range of your ordinary senses. 13 The following passage is found in a scribal copy not used for the text printed here. This copy calls the communicative side of vyapti “communication or broadcasting”, and goes on: What happens in the Amutra happens in the Iha. What the Chit-shakti reveals in the Spirit, the Maya-shakti crudely and materially attempts in the material and mental universes. So spiritual Communism of Vijnana has its shadow in the material and Bolshevik Communism; and the Siddhis of the Vijnana are attempted in wireless telegraphy, broadcasting, telephone, image transcription [ transmission? ]."},{"pageNumber":1489,"pageContent":"Sapta Chatusthaya Scribal Version 1475 Vashita is when you concentrate your will on a person or object so as to control it. Aishwarya is when you merely use the will without any such concentration or control and things happen or people act according to that will. Ishita is when you do not will but merely have a want or need or a sense that something ought to be and that thing comes to you or happens. Mahima is unhampered force in the mental power or in the physi- cal power. In the physical it shows itself by an abnormal strength which is not muscular and may even develop into the power of increasing the size and weight of the body etc. Laghima is a similar power of lightness, that is to say of freedom from all pressure or weighing down in the mental, pranic or physical being. By Laghima it is possible to get rid of weariness and exhaustion and to overcome gravitation. It is the basis of Utthapana. Anima is the power of freeing the atoms of subtle or gross matter (Sukshma or Sthula) from their ordinary limitations. By this power one can get free of physical strain or pain or even make the body as light as one chooses. It is by this power that Yogis were supposed to make themselves invisible [and] invulnerable or [to] free the body from decay and death. Samadhi Samadhi means properly the placing of the consciousness on any particular object or in any particular condition. It is generally used for a state of consciousness in which the mind is withdrawn from outward things by [ones] placing the full energy of the consciousness on any particular object or general field. Thus by Samadhi one can become aware of things in this world outside our ordinary range or go into other worlds or other planes of existence. One can also enter into those parts of ones own existence which are either above or below ordinary consciousness or as it is said “superconscient” or “subconscient”. Samadhi may be in three states Jagrat or waking, Swapna or dream, Sushupta or deep sleep. Jagrat Samadhi is when in the waking consciousness, we are able to concentrate and become aware of things beyond our consciousness."},{"pageNumber":1490,"pageContent":"1476 Record of Yoga This Samadhi may either bring images and experiences seen outside ones own self as if in the physical atmosphere or else inside ones self, generally with the eyes closed. When the eyes are closed, another ether than the physical appears which is called Chittakasha or mental ether. It is in this that images are seen. There is also another ether behind called Chidakasha. Swapna Samadhi is when the mind has lost its outward conscious- ness of outward surroundings and goes inside itself. It then has the experience either in itself or of scenes and happenings of this world or other worlds, of the past, present or future. When these experiences are merely distorted memories or confused, falsified and fragmentary, then it is called ordinary dream. [This happens when] 14 the mind proper is not acting at all in the physical consciousness and only [ ] 15 parts of the nervous system are awake. But when part of the mind remains as it were awake even in [ ] 16 sleep, then one may get [accurate] 17 records of true and actual experiences. These are not dreams but internal visions. Part of the mind is ranging through time and space or in other worlds. Another part is on the watch to receive its experiences and report them to the physical consciousness. Sushupta Samadhi, the third stage, is when the whole physical consciousness, at least that part of it which belongs to the waking self, is asleep. When we are in deep sleep we think that nothing is going on in us; but that is a mistake. Consciousness is active all the time. But no report comes from it to the physical mind. In Sushupta Samadhi, one can get to the very limit of human consciousness, even [to] 18 the superconscient. Everything which we cannot attain in the waking state is there in us in the dream-self and the sleep-self. Samadhi is a means of increasing the range of consciousness. We can extend the inner wakefulness in the swapna to planes of existence which are at present sushupta to us and bring them into experience of swapna and even eventually into the waking state. 14 MS (scribal) That is because 15 MS (scribal) the 16 MS (scribal) the 17 MS (scribal) acute 18 MS (scribal) of"},{"pageNumber":1491,"pageContent":"Sapta Chatusthaya Scribal Version 1477 There are several kinds of Samadhi according to the ordinary classification, such as Satarka in which the mind withdrawn into itself goes on thinking and reasoning and doubting; or Savichara in which the mind does not reason logically but judges and perceives; and so on up to Nirvikalpa Samadhi in which all the lower organs are stopped and there is only the superconscious experience of the Brahman.

He wrote entries with some regularity between 1912 and 1920, as well as scattered entries during the years 1909, 1911 and 1927. Some sections of entries have titles, such as “Journal of Yoga”, “Record of the Yoga”, “Record of Yoga”, “Notebook of the Sadhana”, “Yoga Diary” and “Yoga Record”. The title he used most often is “Record of Yoga” In the text itself he generally referred to the work as “the record” and used the verb “to record” for the act of writing in it. For these reasons the editors have chosen Record of Yoga as the general title of the work. In the entry of 1 July 1912, Sri Aurobindo noted that he had been doing yoga for almost seven years. He had begun in 1905 with the practice of pr ̄ an . ̄ ay ̄ ama or breath control. This practice became irregular when he started his political career in 1906 and by the end of 1907 he suffered a “complete arrest” of yogic experience. In January 1908 a yogi named Vishnu Bhaskar Lele showed him how to silence the activity of his mind. This led to the experience of the static Brahman or Nirvana. A few months later, in Alipore Jail, he had the experience of the dynamic Brahman or cosmic consciousness. He later referred to these as the first two of the “four great realisations” of his yoga. The other two “that of the supreme Reality with the static and dynamic Brahman as its two aspects and that of the higher planes of consciousness leading to the Supermind” began in jail, but developed more fully during the period of sadhana chronicled in the Record. In April 1910, Sri Aurobindo left politics and settled in Pondi- cherry. Sometime after his arrival, as he explained in 1926, he “was given” a “programme of what I would do” in yoga. This programme had seven sections, each made up of four elements. It thus was known as “sapta chatusthaya” or the seven tetrads. (The proper translitera- tion of the Sanskrit phrase is sapta catus . t . aya . Sri Aurobindo almost"},{"pageNumber":1500,"pageContent":"1486 Record of Yoga invariably spelled the second word “chatusthaya”.) Because of the importance of this system to the yoga of the Record, the editors have placed Sri Aurobindos written presentations of the seven chatusthayas before the dated Record entries. The system is explained in more detail in the “scribal version” of Sapta Chatusthaya, which is published in the Appendix, and in the introduction to the glossary, which is published in a separate booklet. All the terms of the system and all other non-English terms found in the Record are defined in the glossary. Sri Aurobindo used an assortment of notebooks and loose sheets for writing the Record. The notebooks are of the same kinds as those used for other writings of the period; indeed many of them also con- tain notes, prose articles, poems, etc. Most of them are cheap student exercise-books, others are simply perforated pads of note-paper. There are also a few bound pocket notebooks; only one of these is a printed di- ary. In all, twenty-eight notebooks were used exclusively or principally for the Record. Several others contain significant amounts of Record material. In addition, a number of diary entries, mostly undated, and an assortment of Record-related jottings have been found scattered in a dozen or more notebooks and on loose sheets and odd scraps of paper. Most diary entries, as opposed to records of “script” and “lipi” (these terms are explained below), seem to have been written down di- rectly without notes. Entries were usually written on the dates given in the headings; sometimes there were two or more sittings in a day. Occa- sionally, however, the sadhana of the preceding night was noted down the next morning. Sometimes a single entry covers two or more days. Other entries seem to have been written a day or two in retrospect. Many Record entries are divided into sections by means of single and double lines in the manuscript. That the lines had a specific pur- pose is indicated by the fact that Sri Aurobindo sometimes cancelled them. So far as typography permits, such lines and other markings are reproduced as they occur in the notebooks. The editors have divided the Record proper, that is, the dated diary entries, into three parts: (1) entries written before the start of the “regular record” in November 1912; (2) the main series of entries, written between November 1912 and October 1920; (3) entries written in 1927 (and perhaps also at the end of 1926). The editors have further"},{"pageNumber":1501,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 1487 divided each of the parts into sections. These begin either where Sri Aurobindo resumed making entries after a significant break in the writing, or where he began work in a new notebook. Each section thus covers a specific chronological period, though sometimes there is a bit of overlap between sections. In one place the editors have put three partly concurrent groups of entries in a single section. Thus divided, the Record proper comprises forty-four sections. Some of these contain scores of entries covering more than a hundred pages, others only a handful of entries covering less than a dozen pages. Sri Aurobindo began some but not all sections with headings written above the first entry or on the cover of the notebook. These have been reproduced as written. The editors have placed a heading in bold type at the beginning of every section. These editorial headings are in the following form: 28 JANUARY–17 FEBRUARY 1911. Over the course of the years, Sri Aurobindo structured sections of entries in different ways. Recurrent features were sometimes aban- doned, only to be taken up again months later. Some entries consist only of the briefest notations, occasionally presented in tabular fash- ion. Other entries were written in discursive prose that sometimes has literary qualities. During certain periods, Sri Aurobindo divided longer entries by means of subheadings. Most of these make use of the terminology of the seven chatusthayas. Like all diaries consciously literary productions excepted the Record was written chiefly as an aid to the diarist. Sri Aurobindos con- ception of its purpose is contained in certain early entries. It was meant to be a “pure record of fact and experience” (13 January 1912). The “condition of the activity” of his sadhana was “to form the substance of the record” (2 January 1913). Stated otherwise, it was the “progress of the siddhi” that was “to be recorded” (31 December 1912). This and other uses of the verb “record” suggest that Sri Aurobindos writing down of an experience was a means by which he established it in his consciousness. Sri Aurobindo wanted to record “definite results”, not “every fluctuation of the siddhi” (15 August 1914). On a path like his, where “all life is yoga”, this involved not only noting down such purely yogic activities as “trikaldrishti, aishwarya, samadhi-experience”, but also mentioning ”work, literary & religi ous”, and making “brief note of the"},{"pageNumber":1502,"pageContent":"1488 Record of Yoga physical siddhi” (27 December 1912). All parts of the sadhana were given attention. We find one passage in which Sri Aurobindo speaks first of applied yogic knowledge and force, trik ̄ aladr . s . t . i and tapas ,then the subtle physical power of levitation and then, in the next sentence, the condition of his teeth. This is followed, without a pause, by a note on the intensity of ̄ ananda (delight) then being felt in his body. The paragraph closes with a mention of the state of “the personal lilamaya relation with the Master of the Yoga”, the personal divinity who guided his sadhana (17 September 1913). Another purpose of the Record was to be a register of guidance from this and other sources. It was, he wrote on 18 November 1914, to “include not only the details of what is accomplished & the lines of the accomplishment that is being attempted, but also the record of experiences and the indications of the future movement”. Such indications were supplied by various means, notably “script”, “lipi”, “sortilege”, and “vani”. Full definitions of these terms are given in the glossary. Roughly, “script” is writing on paper, similar to but not the same as “automatic writing” (see below); “lipi” is writing seen by the subtle vision; “sortilege” is printed or handwritten texts sought or found by chance and interpreted; “vani” is the hearing of a voice. Sri Aurobindo transcribed many examples of each of these sorts of communication in the Record. Sometimes he seems to have jotted down scripts or lipis on handy pieces of paper and then copied them into the Record. A few rough notations of scripts that later were copied exist. The copied versions show some amplification. Sometimes only the rough notations have survived; these have been among the most difficult parts of Record of Yoga to transcribe. There are also numerous examples of script written separately from the Record proper and never incorporated into it. Some of these identify themselves explicitly as “script”, others do not. As a rule such scripts are published in Part Four, separately from the Record proper. The distinction between script and record is one made by Sri Aurobindo himself, but it was sometimes difficult for the editors to fix the boundary between the two. He occasionally used both words to refer to the same piece of writing. For example, in the regular record of 14 January 1912 he mentione d an “accompanying memorandum” containing the “rest of the record of January 14th & the record of"},{"pageNumber":1503,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 1489 January 15th”. This “memorandum” speaks of itself as “script”. Some regular Record entries read like others that identify themselves as script; some entries (for instance, many in June to August 1914) give under the heading “Script” the sort of information generally found in the regular Record. The principal difference between Record proper and script proper appears to be the way the writings took form in Sri Aurobindos consciousness. Record was Sri Aurobindos own “record of fact and experience”, written in much the same was as he wrote his other writ- ings. In the Record the word “I”, if it occurs, refers to Sri Aurobindo himself. Script, on the other hand, was communicated to Sri Aurobindo by “the Master of the Yoga” or another source. This source sometimes addressed itself as “I” and Sri A urobindo as “you” (see for example page 1303). In recording script, Sri Aurobindo often wrote down only the sources replies, not the mental questions to which the replies were given. This makes some scripts seem discontinuous and incomplete; reading them is like overhearing one end of a telephone conversation. Script has some affinities with “automatic writing”, a means of written communication in which the pen is said to be directed by a disembodied spirit. Some examples of this are published in Part Five; the phenomenon is discussed below, in the note to that part. Sri Aurobindo considered many automatic writings to be transcriptions of “the thing that is present in the subconscious part of the medium”. He did not consider script to be of this nature. A comparison of the script published as parts of Record entries and in Part Four with the automatic writing published in Part Five reveals marked differences in subject matter, tone, elevation, and purpose. Script was a “means of spiritual communication” which was used “for all sorts of purposes”. Chief among these was the prediction of future events mostly events in Sri Aurobindos sadhana, but also out- ward happenings, ranging from great world events to trivial domestic matters. Scripts relating to sadhana were often called Prediction or Pro- gramme; they gave indications about inner movements a few days or a week in advance. Sri Aurobindo sometimes looked back on old scripts, predictive lipis and sortileges to check their accuracy. He occasionally jotted down whether they were fulfilled or not. Such notations are among the only evidence we have that Sri Aurobindo read back over"},{"pageNumber":1504,"pageContent":"1490 Record of Yoga the Record. He certainly never revised it in the way he did almost all his other writings. Additions to and corrections of the Record manuscripts were, with few exceptions, evidently made during the act of writing. I NTRODUCTION .S APTA C HATUSTHAYA As mentioned above, Sapta Chatusthaya or the seven tetrads was the “programme” of Sri Aurobindos sadhana that he received sometime after his arrival in Pondicherry in April 1910. It is not known exactly when the system came to him, but it must have been familiar to him by 16 January 1912, when he referred in the Record to “the first two chatusthayas”. (Note that the term “chatusthaya” does not occur in the Record of 28 January–17 February 1911.) The system consists of twenty-eight elements arranged in seven groups of four. Throughout the Record the chatusthayas are referred to both by name and by number. These are listed in the chart below, along with the elements of each chatusthaya: First chatusthaya. Samata chatusthaya [ earlier , Shanti chatusthaya] Samata, Shanti, Sukha, Hasya [ later , (Atma)prasada] Second chatusthaya. Shakti chatusthaya Virya, Shakti, Chandibhava [ later , Daivi Prakriti], Sraddha Third chatusthaya. Vijnana chatusthaya Jnana, Trikaldrishti, Ashtasiddhi, Samadhi Fourth chatusthaya. Sharira chatusthaya Arogya, Utthapana, Saundarya, Ananda [ or Vividhananda] Fifth chatusthaya. Karma chatusthaya [ or Lila chatusthaya] Krishna, Kali, Karma, Kama [ last two sometimes reversed ] Sixth chatusthaya. Brahma chatusthaya Sarvam Brahma, Anantam Bra hma, Jnanam Brahma, Anandam Brahma Seventh chatusthaya. Yoga chatusthaya [ or (San)siddhi chatusthaya] Shuddhi, Mukti, Bhukti, Siddhi This is what Sri Aurobindo called the “natural and logical order” of the chatusthayas and is the only one referred to in the Record proper. Other orders occur, however; for example, the one given in “Outline of the Seven Chatusthayas (Revised Order)” (see next page)."},{"pageNumber":1505,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 1491 In the Record, the elements, or “s iddhis”, of each chatusthaya are sometimes referred to by the number of the element within the cha- tusthaya: for example, “the second element of the shakti-chatusthaya”. In addition the siddhis of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh chatusthayas are often referred to by the numbers 1 to 21 21 and not 20 because in this enumeration the third chatusthaya is considered to have five instead of four elements. The scheme is as follows: 1. Jnana 2. Trikaldrishti 3. Rupa(-siddhi) 4. Tapas 5. Samadhi 6. Arogya 7. Ananda 8. Utthapana 9. Saundarya 10. Krishna 11. Kali 12. Karma 13. Kama 14. Sarvam Brahma 15.

On that day Sri Aurobindo noted in the Record: “The day was chiefly occupied in writing the seven chatusthayas.” The handwriting and paper used for the manuscript of this piece are similar to those of other manuscripts of 1913. Outline of the Seven Chatusthayas (Revised Order). Sri Aurobindo wrote this outline during or not long after 1914 in an exercise-book used previously by one of his disciples for some of the notes published in the Appendix as “Material from Disciples Notebooks”. In it the chatusthayas are listed in a different order from the one generally used in the Record. The “three general chatushtayas” come first, the one that Sri Aurobindo called the “means, the sum and the completion of all the rest” heading the list. Then follow the “four chatusthayas of the Adhara-siddhi”, the perfection or siddhi of the individual “vehicle” ( ̄ adh ̄ ara ). Incomplete Notes on the First Chatusthaya. Sri Aurobindo wrote these notes in the exercise-book he used for the above “Outline of the Seven Chatusthayas”, at around the same time. The end of the last sentence, from the word “qualities”, is not found in the manuscript, but is in several scribal copies of the text written by disciples; it undoubtedly was added by Sri Aurobindo to a copy that has since been lost."},{"pageNumber":1506,"pageContent":"1492 Record of Yoga P ART O NE .D IARY E NTRIES 1909–1912 The diary entries in the first two sections of this part differ in kind from those written afterwards. The first section dates from ten months before Sri Aurobindos arrival in Pondicherry in April 1910, and con- tains little of the terminology of the Sapta Chatusthaya. The entries of 1911, unlike the rest of the Record, are arranged under subject headings. The three sections from 1912 contain entries that differ little from those published in Part Two, but they come before the beginning of what Sri Aurobindo called “the regular record of the sadhana”. 17–25 June 1909. Sri Aurobindo made these entries in a small pocket notebook during a visit to East Bengal (the present Bangladesh). A month and a half earlier, he had been released from jail after his acquittal in the Alipore Bomb Case. As the most prominent leader of the Bengal Nationalist party, he had been invited to Jhalakati, a town in Bakarganj District, to attend the 1909 session of the Bengal Provincial Conference of the Indian National Congress. The principal event of the tour was the speech he delivered in Jhalakati on 19 June 1909 (reproduced on pages 33–42 of Karmayogin , volume 8 of T HE C OMPLETE W ORKS OF S RI A UROBINDO ). 28 January–17 February 1911. During this period Sri Aurobindo wrote dated Record entries under the following six headings: “Phys- ical,” “Communications”, “Vision of other worlds”, “Record of the Drishti”, “Siddhis”, and “Record of Ideal Cognitions”. He wrote them on scattered pages of a notebook he had used years earlier in Baroda as a book catalogue, and later in Pondicherry for various prose and poetic writings. 13 January–8 February 1912. The Record of 12 December 1911 to 11 January 1912, referred to in the first sentence of the entry of 13 January, has not survived. Sri Aurobindo wrote Record entries for January and February 1912 in a notebook he had used in Baroda for literary essays and in Pondicherry for notes and articles on linguistics and other subjects.

During this period, Sri Aurobindo kept the Record in a large ledger used otherwise for notes on linguistics and for prose writings on many subjects. He headed it “Journal of Yoga”. 12 October–26 November 1912. During this period, Sri Aurobindo kept the Record in a small notebook used for Vedic and linguistic notes, translations, Bengali and Latin poetry, etc. The entries of 18 October to 17 November were written in ink on consecutive pages (with one page left blank between the first and second entries of 18 October). The remainder of the entries were written in purple pencil on scattered pages, sometimes upside down in relation to the rest of the entries. In the same notebook he also wrote a brief record of sortileges of May and June 1912 and several other Record-related pieces that are published in Part Four.

On 1 April 1913 Sri Aurobindo began keeping the Record in a new exercise-book, on the cover of which he wrote “Record of Yoga / April.” After making two entries during the first two weeks of April and two entries in May, he set the notebook aside until July. 4–30 June 1913. During the month of June 1913, Sri Aurobindo kept the Record in three separate forms that sometimes overlap, with the result that there are sometimes two entries for a single date. (1) Between 4 June and 28 June, he wrote entries on three sheets of blank paper, each folded to form four narrow pages. He headed this bunch “Record”. These entries are similar to those making up the rest of the Record, although they are written in a more tabular and abbreviated form. (2) Between 16 and 24 June, he wrote a second set of entries on two sheets of blank paper folded like the ones described above. He headed this bunch “Script”. These entries include not only the kind of communications to which he usually gave that name, but also more general comments. (3) Between 25 and 30 June, he wrote several entries similar to the above script notations on a separate sheet of paper (of the same kind as the others and folded similarly) under the title “Record of Details & Guidance.” These three groups of entries are published separately in the above order. 1–11 July 1913.

No Record was written, or none survives, for the month of August 1913. 5–21 September 1913. During this period, Sri Aurobindo kept the Record in the notebook he had set aside in July, leaving three blank pages between the entry for 11 July and the two entries for 5 September.

They are more in the nature of script than ordinary record. No entries were written, or none have survived, for the month of October 1913. 11–23 November 1913. During this period, Sri Aurobindo kept the Record on four pieces of writing paper folded to form sixteen narrow pages (two of which were not used). 24 November–2 December 1913. On 24 November Sri Aurobindo returned to the notebook last used on 21 September. He continued to make entries in this notebook through most of December. 1–12 December 1913. Sri Aurobindo wrote most of the entries for this period on four loose sheets of paper. He also wrote entries for 1, 2 and 12 December in the notebook used for most of 1913 (see the notes immediately above and below). 12–21 December 1913. On 12 December Sri Aurobindo returned to the exercise-book last used on 2 December. He continued to make daily entries in this notebook until 21 December, when he reached its last page. 22 December 1913–15 January 1914. On 22 December Sri Aurobindo began a new exercise-book, on the front cover of which he wrote “Record of Yoga / Dec 22 d 1913...”. On 1 January, in order to mark the new year, he wrote the heading “1914. January.” and part of a verse from the Rig Veda (1.13.6), on an otherwise blank page of the notebook. He continued to use it until 15 January 1914. No Record was written, or none survives, for the period between 15 January and 12 March 1914. 12 March–14 April 1914. On 12 March Sri Aurobindo began a new exercise-book, which he used for the Record until 14 April. He later wrote on its cover: “Record of Yoga. March. April. / 1914.” 15 April–1 June 1914. Sri Aurobindo kept the Record for this period in a single exercise-book, on the cover of which he wrote: “Record of Yoga / April 15 th to / 1914”.

He wrote the heading “Record of Yoga. / June. 1914 ” on an otherwise blank page facing the first page used for entries. After writing the incomplete entry for 29 September, he went on to a new notebook, leaving the last five pages of this one blank. 29–30 September–31 December 1914. After reaching the end of the notebook containing the Record of June to September 1914, Sri Auro- bindo began work in a similar small, hard-cover notebook. Inside the front cover he wrote “October 1914.” Before writing the entry dated “October 1”, he wrote a long note headed “Preliminary” and dated “Sept 29–30”. 1 January–27 February 1915. Sri Aurobindo kept the Record for this period partly in the notebook in use since October 1914 and partly in another. The first notebook contains, after an otherwise blank sheet headed “January”, an introductory note followed by entries for 1–6 and 24–30 January and 1–6, 25 and 27 February 1915. In the second notebook Sri Aurobindo kept an “intermediate record” for 2–23 January. There are thus two sets of entries for 2–6 Jan- uary. The editors reproduce the intermediate record after the first set of entries for 1–6 January, and before the entries of 24 January– 27 February. Sri Aurobindo wrote two annotations to the entry of 3 January in the “intermediate record” sometime after the original entry. The pen and the ink used for the annotations are the same as those used for the Record of January–February 1917, which was kept in the same notebook. Appare ntly Sri Aurobindo wrote these comments when he took up this notebook again after a lapse of two years. 22 April–26 August 1915. During this period, Sri Aurobindo kept the Record in a letter-pad of the sort he used for writing material for the Arya , his monthly philosophical review. The entries begin abruptly; no mention is made of the gap between 27 February and 22 April. Sri Aurobindo put a question-mark after the date “April 22 d ”.

Sri Aurobindo wrote no Record entries between 26 August 1915 and mid-February 1916. On 19 February 1916 he resumed the Record, using the letter-pad he had set aside in August. The last paragraph of the entry for 19 February is found at the bottom of the preceding page in the manuscript, after the general introduction to February 1916. In the margin next to this paragraph, Sri Aurobindo wrote: “This should have been recorded on the next page.” He also put a long double line to separate the misplaced para- graph from the rest of the contents of the page, and inserted the date “Saturday Feb 19 th ” at the top of the paragraph. This date has been put editorially within square brackets at the head of the entry of the nine- teenth, which itself is dated only “Feb”. After the entry of 5 March, the dates written in the manuscript do not agree with the days of the week according to the calendar for 1916. The discrepancy continues until the entry marked “Monday. 19 th March” in the manuscript, where the Record for 1916 terminates. It may be noted that Sri Aurobindo left a page blank between the entry of “Sunday / March 5” and the one marked “Tuesday. Mar 6”. This suggests that he wrote no entry for Monday, 6 March, and this resulted in a confusion of dates. The editors have accordingly emended the dates rather than the days of the week. 9 January–14 February 1917. No Record was written or survives for the period of March 1916 to January 1917. Sri Aurobindo kept the Record of 9 January–14 February 1917 in a small bound notebook used previously for notes on the Veda, for the “intermediate record” of 2–23 January 1915, and again for notes and an essay on the Veda.

Jan 6.” Sri Aurobindo did not write the year 1927 until 7 April (see below), but the agreement between the dates and days of the week written in the notebook and those of the calendar for 1927 proves that this was the year for the entries of January and February. The two pages of undated entries preceding the partially dated ones were apparently written shortly before them. Most likely they belong to the first of three “curves” of progress in Sri Aurobindos sadhana (25 December–3 January, 3–7 January and 7–12 January) which he mentioned in the entry for 6 January. This inference is sup- ported by the text of a prediction written on the second undated page: “Monday next. An ascending scale till then.” It seems probable that Monday, 3 January, the end of the “curve” that began on 25 December, was also the culmination of the “ascending scale” mentioned in the prediction. 7 January–1 February 1927. Sri Aurobindo wrote these entries in the letter-pad used for the above section. The entry of 7 January is preceded by some diagrams and script jottings published in Part Four. 7–22 April 1927. Sri Aurobindo kept the Record for this period in the letter-pad used for the two preceding sections. Between the entry for 1 February and the one for 7 April come several blank pages, two drafts of an essay, some script, and a poem written in French. No Record was written, or none survives, for the period between April and October 1927. 24–31 October 1927. During this eight-day period, Sri Aurobindo kept the Record on two loose sheets of paper. Another sheet discovered with them contains a passage of script published in Part Four.

Purani, one of his early disciples. The explanatory note reproduced below was written by Purani during the 1950s or 1960s: These few pages of Sri Aurobindos diary of his Sadhana were intended to be burnt. The story of how they escaped that fate is as follows. To prepare hot water for the Mothers bath very early in the morning was part of the work I had undertaken almost from 1926. I was staying in the guest-house at that time & used to come to the main house between 2.30–3 in the night. In order not to disturb the inmates of the house I was given a key of one of the gates to enter it. The water had to be ready before 4 oclock, often it was needed at 3.30. (This continued up to 1938 November 23 r . d . when Sri Aurobindo got the accident.) The boiler room is well-known it is now the place from where incense is still fired and flowers distributed when it rains. The fuel used was ordinary wood with wooden shavings from the Carpentry department & waste papers. The wooden shav- ings often contained strips of teak-wood & many other useful tit-bits. I used to preserve them and make time-piece cases, photo-frames, corner brackets from them. When the matter was brought to Mothers notice by someone she approved of such salvaging from waste & added that there were men in France in Paris the chiffonniers who became rich only by utilising the enormous waste of papers & rags in the big city. But the papers I invariably burnt. Perhaps the god of Fire must have become suddenly active, because one day I was struck by half a basketful of torn small bits & casually looked at them. To my surprise and horror I found Sri Aurobindos handwriting. I put them aside and looked at them in the day- light. I was able to make out with great labour extending for days like a jig-saw puzzle two or three readable pages.

P ART F OUR .M ATERIALS W RITTEN BY S RI A UROBINDO R ELATED D IRECTLY TO R ECORD OF Y OGA , C . 1910–1931 This part consists of writings in Sri Aurobindos own hand that may be considered components of Record of Yoga , but which have not been included in Parts One to Three because they are undated or incompletely dated or, if dated, not concerned with Sri Aurobindos day-to-day sadhana. A number of different sorts of writings are repre- sented: brief undated Record entries, scripts, sortileges, lipis, and notes on a wide variety of sadhana-related topics. They have been arranged in rough chronological order, groups of scripts being placed together in several chronological series. Undated Record and Record-related Notes, c. 1910–1914. Sri Auro- bindo wrote these fourteen items in different notebooks during the early part of his stay in Pondicherry, that is between 1910 and 1914. Further details on individual pieces or groups of pieces follow. [1] Sri Aurobindo jotted down these undated notes around 1910 in a note- book containing translations and other pieces written years earlier in Baroda and Calcutta. [2] Sri Aurobindo wrote these notes in a notebook used in Baroda for misce llaneous literary writings and in Pondicherry for philological notes. They begin with a reference to Sri Aurobindos philological research under the heading “Bhasha” (“Language”). Sri Aurobindos did most of his philological research around 1911–12. The present notes may be assigned to the same period. They have, in addition, some similarity to the Record entries of January–February 1911. Both the notes and the entries are ar- ranged by category, and have one heading in common: “Prophecy”. This term is used several times in January–February 1911 for what Sri Aurobindo normally called “trikaldrishti”. “Prophecy” occurs rarely in 1912 and all but disappears from the terminology of the Record after that.

They date from the earliest years in Pondicherry, that is, 1910–12. Some of them may even have been written slightly before that. [14] Sri Aurobindo wrote these “Psychological Notes” (his title) in an exercise-book of the kind he used to keep the Record of 1913 and early 1914. The exercise- book also contains a draft of the last version of the “Life Divine” commentary on the Isha Upanishad (see Isha Upanishad , volume 17 of the T HE C OMPLETE W ORKS ). This commentary may be dated to 1914. The psychological notes apparently date from the same year. Sortileges of May and June 1912. These two sortileges were written on a page of the notebook that later was used for the Record of 12 October to 26 November 1912 (see above). Undated Notes, c. November 1912. Written on the first two pages of the notebook used for the Record of 12 October to 26 November 1912. Draft Programme of 3 December 1912. Written on one of the last pages of the notebook used for the Record of 12 October to 26 November. The programme subsequently was copied, with a few changes, in the Record entry of 3 December, which was written in another notebook. Undated or Partly Dated Script, 1912–1913. These nine scripts were written on nine different sheets or sets of sheets during the years 1912 and 1913. Further details on individual pieces follow. [1] Written ap- parently around July 1912, the approximate date of the incomplete “Commentary on the Kena Upanishad” which is referred to in the script. Note also that in the Record of 4 July 1912, Sri Aurobindo wrote “Automatic script recommenced t oday”, and mentioned “prophetic script”, a term found nowhere else in the Record. [2] This “record of thought” or script was written at the bottom of a loose sheet containing linguistic notes. Two sentences from it appear verbatim in the Record of 14 October 1912. The script evidently was written on that day and part of it transcribed in the Record. [3] These three pieces of script were written on the inner pages of a large folded sheet of paper used otherwise for linguistic notes and fragmentary writings on other subjects. The linguistic notes are very similar to those found along with item [2]. It is therefore likely that the scripts date from roughly the same period. The predictions contained in the first script may be the same as the “programme suggeste d on the tenth” mentioned in"},{"pageNumber":1518,"pageContent":"1504 Record of Yoga the Record of 21 December 1912. There are a number of similarities between the elements of sadhana me ntioned in the present script and those described in the Record of 10–11 December 1912. [4] This item, written on the last ten of a set of twenty-eight small pages formed by folding loose sheets of paper, may be assigned with some confidence to January 1913. It consists of a long undated passage, followed by four shorter entries with dates from the “21 s . t . ” to the “24 th ”. The month and year are not specified, but under the “23 d ” there is a reference to “this month of January”. The year 1913 may be established by comparison with the regular Record of January of that year. See for example the almost identical references to the Turkish city of Adri- anople in the script of the “23 d ” and the Record of 24 January 1913. Since the partly dated portions of the script belong to 21–24 January 1913, the undated passage preceding them must have been written just before the 21st. Note also that the Record of 19 January states: “This morning script became profuse and intimate. . . .” The script contains some examples of writings in different languages known and unknown. Sri Aurobindo wrote or “received” a number of such writings around this time. The first eighteen of the set of pages on which the script is written are devoted to this project. Some examples of such “writings in different languages” are published in Vedic Studies with Writings on Philology , volume 14 of T HE C OMPLETE W ORKS . [5] This script was written sometime around June 1913 on a sheet of letter paper found along with some Vedic and linguistic notes. The paper is of the type used also for item [6] as well as for letters written around June 1913. The third and fifth of the seven “rules” here correspond to some of the five “positive directions” given in the script of 22 June 1913, which is published as part of the Record proper. [6] These four paragraphs of script, written on two loose sheets similar in type to those used for item [5], contain no explicit dating clues, but the position they describe corresponds closely to the one referred to in the Record of 10 and 11 July 1913. The first paragraph says: “Lipi is already moving forward to the mahat....” The Record of 10 July speaks of the “su ccessful movement from manas to mahat predicted in the script”, and observes: “The only siddhi which advanced during the day was the lipi.” The second paragraph deals with a movement of the vijnana to brihat, to be followed by a further change to satyam and ritam. This is the situation"},{"pageNumber":1519,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 1505 described at the beginning of the second sentence of the Record of 11 July 1913: “At first the knowledge was merely brihat in manas ....” [7] This script, written on a single loose sheet, contains no explicit dating clues, but the situation it de scribes corresponds to the position of Sri Aurobindos sadhana between July and September 1913. The script may well have been written during the suspension of the regular Record between 11 July and 5 September 1913. [8] This short piece was written at the bottom of the sheet containing the first six paragraphs of the Record of 12 November 1913, but upside down in relation to them. It apparently was written before the commencement or at any rate the completion of the Record entry, which otherwise would have used the space occupied by the script. The style is similar to that of some of the “Thoughts and Aphorisms” and to the “Thought” noted down in the Record of 24 June 1914 beginning “Despise not, O thinker. . . .” [9] This long script was written on a large loose sheet folded to make four pages, the bottom edges of all of which have been damaged. The sheet was found together with the Record entries of 11–23 November 1913 and apparently belongs to t he same period; note the phrase “till December” in the second paragraph. There are many similarities between the position of the sadhana as described in this script and in the Record of 12–18 November 1913. Compare, for example, the following passage in the script: “ Today a great movement forward. . . . The trikaldrishti, telepathy, power, lipi have now all to move towards absolute perfection dragging the samadhi & drishti with them. Till that is done, the fourth chatusthaya will only prepare its advance . . .” with this passage in the Record of 14 November: “Today is to be a day of rapid progress in the third chatusthaya and the preparation of rapid progress in the fourth.” Similarly the last page of the script has parallels with the Record of 17 and 18 November, while the last complete paragraph of the script has similarities to the Record of 18 November 1913.

The year is not given but it may be inferred from (1) the handwriting, (2) the period of the other pieces in the notebook, (3) the fact that no regular Record, in which a sortilege would normally have been entered, was kept in March 1913.

Sri Aurobindo wrote “Record of Yogic details” on the cover of this notebook. It should be remembered that to him “All life is Yoga.” Record Notes, 13 and 15 September 1913. Sri Aurobindo wrote these two entries under the heading “Record of Yoga. / Theosophic.” in the notebook used previously for the “Record of Yogic details” (see above) and subsequently for the Record of 22–30 September 1913. The year, not given explicitly, may be inferred from this position. Note that Sri Aurobindo also wrote a regular Record entry in another notebook on 13 September. Vedic Experience, 14 and 15 December 1913. Sri Aurobindo wrote regular Record entries for both these days, but chose to enter this experience in a notebook used otherwise for Vedic translations and notes. Undated Notes, c. 1914. Sri Aurobindo wrote these notes headed “Vi- jnanachatusthaya” on a loose sheet of paper that was found inserted in a notebook used, among other things, for the Record of July 1912. The sheet, however, does not appear to be connected with anything in the notebook, and may have been put there simply as a placemark. The handwriting is that of 1912–14. It is possible that these notes are the “separate detailed record of the results” of the “formulated & steady activity for the regulation of the third chatusthaya” that Sri Aurobindo wrote of having “commenced” in the Record of 1 June 1914. Notes on Images Seen in March 1914. Sri Aurobindo wrote this piece, which he entitled “The Evolutionary Scale”, in March 1914 in an exercise-book of the same sort as he was using then for the Record. In the Record entry of 22 March 1914, he spoke of certain “scenes of a pursuit in the early Manwantaras of a race of divinised Pashus by Barbarians” which were “recorded elsewhere”. The reference is evidently to the second section of “The Evolutionary Scale”, which begins: “A series of images and a number of intimations have been given yesterday in the chitra-drish ti to illustrate the history of the first two Manwantaras. . . .” The word “yesterday”, which was added between the lines, would seem to indicate that the second, and probably the first and third sections as well, were written on 23 March.

Undated Script, c. 1920. The first of these two scripts is the last piece of writing in a letter-pad whose other contents (Vedic translations, etc.) provide no explicit dating clues. The term “drashtri vijnana”, which occurs in the script, is found otherwise only in the Record of March 1920. The second piece, consisting of three short entries, was written on two loose sheets that cannot be precisely dated. The third entry employs the term “logos Vijnana”, which occurs in the Record only in October 1920. Undated Notes, c. December 1926. Sri Aurobindo wrote all but the last of these seven pieces in a letter-pad used previously for Vedic notes and subsequently for the Record of January–February and April 1927, as well as for certain undated Record entries, scripts, etc. “The Seven Suns of the Supermind” is followed closely by Record entries that are considered to have been written in December 1926. It seems likely that that piece and the five preceding it were written in the same month. Sri Aurobindo wrote the seventh piece, “The Seven Centres of the Life”, on a sheet from another letter-pad, apparently around the same time. Undated Notes, c. January 1927. Sri Aurobindo wrote these notes, in which the names of some of his disciples are linked with those of historical, legendary and divine figures, in the letter-pad of 1926–27 referred to above. Before and after it are Record notes that have been dated to the last week of December 1926 and the first week of January 1927. Notes on Physical Transformation, c. January 1927. Sri Aurobindo wrote these notes in the letter-pad of 1926–27. They come just before the Record notes dated “Thursday. Jan 6.” They appear to be more in the nature of script than ordinary writing. (The word “you” obviously refers to Sri Aurobindo, while “she” d esignates the Mother, as it does in several Record entries of January 1927.) Diagrams, c. January 1927.

Sri Aurobindo wrote these dated notes in a tiny note-pad used otherwise to record electric-meter readings. Undated Script, c. 1927. Sri Aurobindo wrote these three sets of script notations in a notebook belonging to the year 1927. Pieces [1] and [2] come a little before writings that may be dated with some certainty to July–August 1927; but some similarities between the terminology of these entries and the Record of January 1927 suggest that the entries may have been written earlier in the year. The third piece occurs further on in the same notebook, and appears to date from somewhat later in 1927. Undated Script, c. 1927–1928. These four passages of script all come from manuscripts datable to late 1927 or 1928. All contain references to “overmind”, a term that first occurs in the Record in the entry of 29 October 1927.

These fifteen passages of script were jot- ted down by Sri Aurobindo on the pages of various notebooks and loose pieces of paper between circa 1915 and the late 1920s. They are arranged in roughly chronological order, though their dates and sometimes even periods are difficult to determine.

He took it up “as an experiment as well as an amusement” after observing “some very extraordinary automatic writing” done by his brother Barin; “very much struck and interested” by the phenomenon, “he decided to find out by practising this kind of writing himself what there was behind it.” Barin seems at least sometimes to have used a planchette for his experiments, but Sri Aurobindo generally just “held the pen while a disembodied being wrote off what he wished, using my pen and hand”. He continued these experiments during his political career (1906–10) and afterwards. In this part are published one example from 1907, an entire book received as automatic writing in 1910, and a number of examples from two years during which he also kept the Record: 1914 and 1920. His “final conclusion” about automatic writing was that though there are some times phenomena which point to the intervention of beings of another plane, not always or often of a high order, the mass of such writings comes from a dramatising element in the subconscious mind; sometimes a brilliant vein in the subliminal is struck and then predictions of the future and statements of things known in the present and past come up, but otherwise these writings have not a great value. During the period of the Record, Sri Aurobindo made much use of a form of writing he called “script”. As explained above, this was similar to automatic writing in that it came as a communication from another source, but differed from automatic writing in coming from a source that he considered to be higher and more reliable. It should be noted, however, that the distinction of “script” from ordinary automatic writing was not always strictly maintained. Some writings from a lower source refer to themselves as script (see for example page 1410), and Sri Aurobindo used the word “script” for writings that were produced in s ́ eances with others (see for example the Record of 17 July 1914, where he writes: “Today excellent script with R [Richard]"},{"pageNumber":1525,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 1511 & Madame R.”) In these examples, “script” is used as a generic term to cover all forms of written communication from other sources. “The Scribblings”, c. 1907. Written in a notebook previously used by Sri Aurobindo in Baroda for miscellaneous writings. In May 1908 this notebook and several others were seized by the police when Sri Aurobindo was arrested in connection with the Alipore Bomb Case. These automatic writings were submitted by the prosecution as evi- dence against Sri Aurobindo, but were not accepted by the judge as being in Sri Aurobindos hand. They were, however, certainly writ- ten by him, though, being automatic, they are somewhat illegible; hence the name by which they were known during the trial: “The Scribblings”. They mention Barindra Kumar Ghose, Sri Aurobindos younger brother, who was the active head of a revolutionary group, as well as three other members. Yogic Sadhan. Sri Aurobindo received this book as automatic writing in 1910. According to his biographer A. B. Purani, During the first three months of the stay at Pondicherry [April –June 1910] there used to be s ́ eances in the evening in which automatic writing was done. The book Yogic Sadhan was written in this way. At the rate of one chapter per day, the book was finished in a week or eight days. . . . The Editors Epilogue added after the last chapter was written by Sri Aurobindo himself. The editors name is given as “the Uttar[a] Yogi”. A year later, the text that had been received was transcribed and pub- lished under the title Yogic Sadhan by Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam. “The Uttara Yogi” (the Yogi from the North) is a name by which Sri Aurobindo was known to the person who published the book. A second edition of Yogic Sadhan , lightly revised, was brought out by the Modern Press, Pondicherry, in 1920. Two further editions were brought out by Arya Publishing House, Calcutta, in 1923 and 1933. The present text follows the second edition with a few emendations, mainly in chapters 7–9, for which a manuscript in Sri Aurobindos hand survives. Sri Aurobindo permitted the publication of Yogic Sadhan , but he did not consider it his own work. In a letter of 1934 he wrote:"},{"pageNumber":1526,"pageContent":"1512 Record of Yoga The Yogic Sadhan is not Sri Aurobindos own writing, but was published with a note by him, that is all. The statement made to the contrary by the publishers was an error which they have been asked to correct. There is no necessity of fol- lowing the methods suggested in that book unless one finds them suggestive or helpful as a preliminary orientation of the consciousness e.g. in the up-building of an inner Will etc. The “note” referred to is the “Editors Epilogue”, which was included in all editions of Yogic Sadhan . Sri Aurobindo allowed the book to go out of print after the edition of 1933 was sold out. It has not been reprinted since then in the form of a book. Automatic writings, c. 1914 (First Set). These four pieces of automatic writing are found on four loose sheets of paper folded together. They are not dated but almost certainly were written in 1914. The sheet on which item [1] was written contains also a draft of something published in the journal Arya in August of that year. Item [2] contains a reference to “the Review”, that is, the Arya , which was conceived around 1 June 1914 and first published in August. Items [3] and [4] seem to have been written around the same time as the first two items. Automatic writings, c. 1914 (Second Set). These two pieces of auto- matic writing were written on four loose sheets of paper folded to make eight pages. The sheets were found along with those on which the previous set were written, and appear to belong to the same period. Automatic Writing, c. 1920. This short writing was found in a letter- pad used principally for Vedic translations and notes. Below it, on the same page, are a few lines that have b een classified as Record-related script and published in Part Four (the first piece of “Undated Script, c. 1920”). That piece has been dated by terminology to around March 1920. The present writing describes itself as “script”, that is, a “means of embodied communication with the other worlds”; but the “spirit of the higher realms” who speaks is evidently not the Master of the Yoga. The item is therefore classified as automatic writing rather than script. Automatic Writings, c. 1920. These nineteen writings were found together in a single batch of seventy-eight loose sheets.

Lokamanya Tilak, who is referred to in item [9] as having departed from the body, apparently rather recently, died on 1 August 1920. The letter referred to in item [8] very likely is the one written by Tilaks associate Dr. B. S. Munje to Sri Aurobindo, inviting him to preside over the 1920 session of the Indian National Congress. Sri Aurobindos reply turning down this offer is dated 30 August 1920. Mirra Richard (The Mother) and Paul Richard participated in some if not all the sessions. (See especially item [9].) They returned to Pondicherry from Japan on 24 April 1920. Richard left Pondicherry in December of the same year. A PPENDIX .M ATERIAL FROM D ISCIPLES N OTEBOOKS The pieces in this Appendix have been transcribed from versions hand- written by early disciples of Sri Aurobindo. They are copies of notes written by Sri Aurobindo or of written records of his oral remarks. With one partial exception, none of these items exist in the form of manuscripts in Sri Aurobindos handwriting. The exception is on the last page of item [1] of the “Miscellaneous Notes”, where there are three pieces that were written or revised by Sri Aurobindo in his own hand. Only these pieces may be considered to be as authentic as the handwritten Record. Nevertheless, Sri Aurobindo may be regarded as the origin of all the pieces in this appendix, as they are either transcrip- tions of his talks or copies of now-lost written texts. They represent aspects of his teaching in an early form as given to his earliest disciples. Miscellaneous Notes, c. 1914. These seven sets of notes are reproduced from handwritten copies made by disciples of Sri Aurobindo in various notebooks. Early copies of items [1], [2] and [5] were written in the exercise-book he used subsequent ly for the “Incomplete Notes on the First Chatusthaya” published in the Introduction. This notebook has “1914” printed on the cover. Another notebook containing the prin- cipal versions of items [3], [4], [6] and [7] has calendars for 1913 and 1914 printed inside the front cover. Many of the disciples notebooks contain a copy of a letter written by Sri Aurobindo on 21 September"},{"pageNumber":1528,"pageContent":"1514 Record of Yoga 1914. It is reasonable to conclude that the pieces date roughly from the period around 1914. Sapta Chatusthaya Scribal Version. This presentation of Sapta Cha- tusthaya is the most complete one available. There is no manuscript of the piece in Sri Aurobindos hand, but he was undoubtedly its source. The text survives only in the form of transcripts written down by disciples. Several of these “scribal copies”, as the editors term them, have been collated and two of the oldest selected as the basis of the present text. One of the scribal copies may date from as early as 1914; two others are from the mid-1920s, and most or all of the rest from the 1930s. These copies were made either from a now-lost manuscript written by Sri Aurobindo or, more likely, from one or more written records of a series of talks given by him. The scribal copies may be considered on the whole to be reliable records of the substance of what Sri Aurobindo must have written or said; but all of them contain obvious distortions of his words. Because of this, a much freer hand has been used in the editing of this piece than would have been permissible if the text was based on a handwritten manuscript. The text is “eclectic”; that is to say, it follows for the most part the scribal version that seems to offer the best text as a whole, but it makes use of readings from the other principal scribal copy where these appear more likely to represent Sri Aurobindos actual words. Where the scribal copies agree but the reading seems defective, an editorial alternative has been printed between square brackets, as part of the text, and the scribal version given in a footnote. (Such footnote variants are preceded by “ MS (scribal) ”.) The editors have silently made minor corrections of the spelling, punctuation, etc. of these scribal texts. P UBLISHING H ISTORY No part of Record of Yoga was published during Sri Aurobindos lifetime. The notebooks and loose sheets containing the diary entries and related materials were found after his passing along with his other manuscripts. Most of Record of Yoga was published in the journal Sri Aurobindo: Archives and Research between 1986 and 1994. Some ma- terial mainly in Parts One, Four and the first section of the Appendix"},{"pageNumber":1529,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 1515 was omitted when Record of Yoga was published in that journal and appears here for the first time. The publishing history of Yogic Sadhan has been given above in the note on Part Five. “The Seven Suns of the Supermind” and the diagrams in Part Four were included in The Hour of God (Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram) in 1959 and subsequently; there the diagrams were given the editorial title “The Divine Plan”. A few related pieces that were added to the reorganised 1982 edition of The Hour of God are also included in Part Four. In 1973, Sri Aurobindos manuscript version of “Sapta Chatusthaya” was published, with much editorial normalisation of the spelling of Sanskrit words and other details, in volume 27 ( Supplement ) of the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library. The text of this first edition of Record of Yoga has been repro- duced verbatim, as far as possible, from the manuscripts of the diary entries and related materials."}]
