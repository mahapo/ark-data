There are indications in Sri Aurobindo's Pondicherry note- books that he intended to bring out a collection of essays on yoga and other subjects. The headings written above two pieces, ™Essays Divine and Human∫ and ™Essays – Human and Divine∫, seem to have been intended as possible titles for this proposed book. The editors have chosen the Ærst of these to be the title of the present volume. The material has been arranged in four parts: I. Essays Divine and Human – complete essays on yoga and related subjects, arranged in Æve chronological sections. II. From Man to Superman: Notes and Fragments on Phi- losophy, Psychology and Yoga , arranged in three thematic sections. III. Notes and Fragments on Various Subjects , arranged in Æve thematic sections. IV. Thoughts and Aphorisms , as arranged by the author in three sections, with a section of additional aphorisms. All the writings in this book have been reproduced from Sri Aurobindo's manuscripts. He did not prepare any of them for publication and left many in an unÆnished state.

Sooner shall man arrive at the borders of inÆnity than at the fulness of his own being. For that being is inÆnity, is God – I aspire to inÆnite force, inÆnite knowledge, inÆnite bliss. Can I attain it? Yes, but the nature of inÆnity is that it has no end. Say not therefore that I attain it. I become it. Only so can man attain God by becoming God. But before attaining he can enter into relations with him. To enter into relations with God is Yoga, the highest rapture & the noblest utility. There are relations within the compass of the humanity we have developed. These are called prayer, worship, adoration, sacriÆce, thought, faith, science, philosophy. There are other relations beyond our developed capacity, but within the compass of the humanity we have yet to develop. Those are the relations that are attained by the various practices we usually call Yoga. We may not know him as God, we may know him as Nature, our Higher Self, InÆnity, some ineffable goal. It was so that Bud- dha approached Him; so approaches him the rigid Adwaitin. He is accessible even to the Atheist. To the materialist He disguises Himself in matter. For the Nihilist he waits ambushed in the bosom of Annihilation. y \u0003 yTA mA \\ þp\u0006t \u0003 tA \\-tT {v BjAMyhm ^ ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Moksha The pessimists have made moksha synonymous with annihila- tion or dissolution, but its true meaning is freedom. He who is free from bondage, is free, is mukta. But the last bondage is the passion for liberation itself which must be renounced before the soul can be perfectly free, and the last knowledge is the realisation that there is none bound, none desirous of freedom, but the soul is for ever and perfectly free, that bondage is an illusion and the liberation from bondage is an illusion. Not only are we bound but in play, the mimic knots are of such a nature that we ourselves can at our pleasure undo them. Nevertheless the bonds are many and intricate. The most difÆcult of all their knots is egoism, the delusion that we have an individual existence sufÆcient in itself, separate from the uni- versal and only being, ekamevadwitiyam, who is one not only beyond Time, Space and Causality. Not only are we all Brahman in our nature and being, waves of one sea, but we are each of us Brahman in His entirety, for that which differentiates and limits us, nama and rupa, exists only in play and for the sake of the world-drama. Whence then comes this delusion of egoism, if there is no separate existence and only Brahman is? We answer that there is separate existence but only in manifestation not in reality. It is as if one actor could play different parts not in succession but at one and the same moment; each part is He Himself, one and indivis- ible, but each part is different from the other. Brahman extends Himself in Time, Space & Causality which do not condition Him but exist in Him and can at any time be changed or abolished, and in Time, Space & Causality He attaches Himself to many namarupas which are merely existences in His universal being. They are real in manifestation, unreal outside manifestation."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Man The Shastras use the same word for man and the one divine and universal Being – Purusha – as if to lay stress upon the oneness of humanity with God. Nara and Narayana are the eternal couple, who, though they are two, are one, eternally different, eternally the same. Narayana, say the scholiasts, is he who dwells in the waters, but I rather think it means he who is the essence and sum of all humanity. Wherever there is a man, there there is Narayana; for the two cannot be separated. I think sometimes that when Christ spoke of himself as the Son of Man, he really meant the son of the Purusha, and almost Ænd myself imagining that anthropos is only the clumsy Greek equivalent, the literal and ignorant translation of some Syrian word which corresponded to our Purusha. Be that as it may, there can be no doubt that man is full of divine possibilities – he is not merely a term in physical evolution, but himself the Æeld of a spiritual evolution which with him began and in him will end. It was only when man was made, that the gods were satisÆed – they who had rejected the animal forms, – and cried s \u0000 k \u0002 tm \u0003v , ™Man indeed is well and wonderfully made; the higher evolution can now begin.∫ He is like God, the sum of all other types and creatures from the ani- mal to the god, inÆnitely variable where they are Æxed, dynamic where they, even the highest, are static, and, therefore, although in the present and in his attainment a little lower than the angels, yet in the eventuality and in his culmination considerably higher than the gods. The other or Æxed types, animals, gods, giants, Titans, demigods, can rise to a higher development than their own, but they must use the human body and the terrestrial birth to effect the transition."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Philosophy The knowledge which the man of pure intellect prefers to a more active and mundane curiosity, has in its surroundings a certain loftiness and serene detachment that cannot fail in their charm. To withdraw from contact with emotion and life and weave a luminous colourless shadowless web of thought, alone and far away in the inÆnite azure empyrean of pure ideas, can be an enthralling pastime Æt for Titans or even for Gods. The ideas so found have always their value and it is no objection to their truth that, when tested by the rude ordeal of life and experience, they go to pieces. All that inopportune disaster proves is that they are no Æt guides to ordinary human conduct; for material life which is the Æeld of conduct is only intellectual on its mountaintops; in the plains and valleys ideas must undergo limitation by unideal conditions and withstand the shock of crude sub-ideal forces. Nevertheless conduct is a great part of our existence and the mere metaphysical, logical or scientiÆc knowledge that either does not help me to act or even limits my self-manifestation through action, cannot be my only concern. For God has not set me here merely to think, to philosophise, to weave metaphysical systems, to play with words and syllogisms, but to act, love and know. I must act divinely so that I may become divine in being and deed; I must learn to love God not only in Himself but in all beings, appearances, objects, enjoyments, events, whether men call them good or bad, real or mythical, fortunate or calamitous; and I must know Him with the same divine impartiality and completeness in order that I may come to be like Him, perfect, pure and unlimited – that which all sons of Man must one day be. This, I cannot help thinking, is the meaning and purpose of the Lila. It is not true that because I think, I am; but rather because I think, feel and act, and even while I am doing any or all of these things, can transcend the thought, feeling and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Philosophy 9 action, therefore I am. Because I manifest, I am, and because I transcend manifestation, I am. The formula is not so clear and catching as the Cartesian, but there is a fuller truth in its greater comprehensiveness. The man of unalloyed intellect has a very high and difÆcult function; it is his function to teach men to think clearly and purely. In order to effect that for mankind, to carry reason as far as that somewhat stumbling and hesitating Pegasus will go, he sacriÆces all the bypaths of mental enjoyment, the shady alleys and the moonlit gardens of the soul, in order that he may walk in rare air and a cold sunlight, living highly and austerely on the peaks of his mind and seeking God severely through knowledge. He treads down his emotions, because emotion distorts reason and replaces it by passions, desires, preferences, prejudices, pre- judgments. He avoids life, because life awakes all his sensational being and puts his reason at the mercy of egoism, of sensational reactions of anger, fear, hope, hunger, ambition, instead of al- lowing it to act justly and do disinterested work. It becomes merely the paid pleader of a party, a cause, a creed, a dogma, an intellectual faction. Passion and eagerness, even intellectual eagerness, so disÆgure the greatest minds that even Shankara becomes a sophist and a word-twister, and even Buddha argues in a circle. The philosopher wishes above all to preserve his intellectual righteousness; he is or should be as careful of his mental rectitude as the saint of his moral stainlessness. Therefore he avoids, as far as the world will let him, the conditions which disturb. But in this way he cuts himself off from experience and only the gods can know without experience. Siey ¡ es said that politics was a subject of which he had made a science. He had, but the pity was that though he knew the science of politics perfectly, he did not know politics itself in the least and when he did enter political life, he had formed too rigidly the logical habit to replace it in any degree by the practical. If he had reversed the order or at least coordinated experiment with his theories before they were formed, he might have succeeded better. His readymade Constitutions are monuments of logical perfection and practical ineffectiveness. They have the weakness"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10 Essays Divine and Human of all logic; – granting your premises, your conclusion is all- triumphant; but then who is going to grant you your premises? There is nothing Fact and Destiny delight in so much as upsetting the logician's major and minor. The logician thinks he has ensured himself against error when he has made a classiÆcation of particular fallacies; but he forgets the supreme and general fallacy, the fallacy of think- ing that logic can, as a rule, prove anything but particular and partial propositions dealing with a fragmentary and one-sided truth. Logic? But Truth is not logical; it contains logic, but is not contained by it. A particular syllogism may be true, so far as it goes, covering a sharply limited set of facts, but even a set of syllogisms cannot exhaust truth on a general subject, for the simple reason that they necessarily ignore a number of equally valid premises, facts or possibilities which support a modiÆed or contrary view. If one could arrive Ærst at a conclusion, then at its exact opposite and, Ænally, harmonise the contradiction, one might arrive at some approach to the truth. But this is a process logic abhors. Its fundamental conception is that two contradictory statements cannot be true at the same time and place & in the same circumstances. Now, Fact and Nature and God laugh aloud when they hear the logician state his funda- mental conception. For the universe is based on the simultaneous existence of contradictions covering the same time, place and circumstances. The elementary conception that God is at once One and Many, Finite & InÆnite, Formed and Formless and that each attribute is the condition of the existence of its opposite, is a thing metaphysical logic has been boggling over ever since the reign of reason began. The metaphysician thinks that he has got over the difÆculty about the validity of premises by getting to the tattwas, the ideal truths of universal existence. Afterwards, he thinks, there can be no fear of confusion or error and by understanding and Æxing them we shall be able to proceed from a sound basis to the rest of our task. He fashions his critique of reason, his system of pramanas, and launches himself into the wide inane. Alas, the tattwas are the very foundation, support and initial reason of this"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Philosophy 11 worldwide contradiction and logically impossible conciliation of opposites in which God has shadowed out some few rays of His luminous & inÆnite reality, – impossible to bind with the narrow links of a logical chain precisely because it is inÆnite. As for the pramanas, their manipulation is the instrument of all difference of opinion and the accompaniment to an unending jangle of debate. Both the logician and the philosopher are apt to forget that they are dealing with words and words divorced from experi- ence can be the most terrible misleaders in the world. Precisely because they are capable of giving us so much light, they are also capable of lighting us into impenetrable darkness. Tato bhuya iva te tamo ya u vidyayam ratah; ™Deeper is the darkness into which they enter who are addicted to knowledge alone.∫ This sort of word worship and its resultant luminous darkness is very common in India and nowhere more than in the intellectualities of religion, so that when a man talks to me about the One and Maya and the Absolute, I am tempted to ask him, ™My friend, how much have you experienced of these things in which you instruct me or how much are you telling me out of a vacuum or merely from intellectual appreciation? If you have merely ideas and no experience, you are no authority for me and your logic is to me but the clashing of cymbals good to deafen an opponent into silence, but of no use for knowledge. If you say you have experienced, then I have to ask you, `Are you sure you have measured all possible experience?' If you have not, then how can you be sure that my contradictory experience is not equally true? If you say you have, then I know you to be deluded or a pretender, one who has experienced a fragment or nothing; for God in His entire being is unknowable, avijnatam vijanatam.∫ The scientist thinks he has corrected the mistakes of the metaphysician because he refuses to deal with anything but a narrow and limited circle of facts and condemns everything else as hallucination, imposture and imagination. His parti pris, his Æerce and settled prejudgments, his determined begging of the question are too obvious and well known to need particular il- lustration. He forgets that all experiences are facts, that ideas are"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 Essays Divine and Human facts, that subjective knowledge is the one fact of which he can be decently sure and that he knows nothing even of the material world by his senses but only by the use his subjective knowl- edge makes of the senses. Many a materialist will tell you that only those facts can be accepted as a basis to knowledge which the senses supply, – a position which no man can substantiate and which his science daily denies in practice. These reasoners consent to trust to their sovereign subjective instrument when it settles for them the truths about this world visible to their lower instruments, but the same sovereign instrument is condemned as wholly fallacious and insane when it deals in precisely the same way with another Æeld of perceptions and experiences. When my subjective experience tells him, ™I am hungry∫, he consents; ™Of course, you must be since you say so.∫ But let it tell him, ™I am full of bliss from an immaterial source∫; or ™By certain higher instruments repeatedly tested I know that I have wandered in regions illuminated by no material sun,∫ and he answers, ™You are only Æt for the gaol or the lunatic asylum.∫ No one has seen the earth whirling round the sun, indeed we see daily the opposite, yet he holds the Ærst opinion obstinately, but if you say ™Although God is not seen of men, yet He exists,∫ he turns from you angrily and stalks into his laboratory. The practical man avoids error by refusing to think at all. His method at least cannot be right. It is not right even for the practical uses he prefers exclusively to all others. You see him stumbling into some pit because he refuses to walk with a light and then accusing adverse circumstances or his evil fortune, or he shouts, elbows, jostles, tumbles and stumbles himself into a Ænal success and departs at last, satisÆed; leaving behind a name in history and a legacy of falsehood, evil and suffering to unborn generations. The method of the practical man is the shortest and most facile, but the least admirable of all. Truth is an inÆnitely complex reality and he has the best chance of arriving nearest to it who most recognises but is not daunted by its inÆnite complexity.

Some minds, like Plato, like Vivekananda, feel more than others this mighty complexity and give voice to it. They pour out thought in torrents or in rich and majestic streams. They are not logically careful of consistency, they cannot build up any coherent, yet comprehensive systems, but they quicken men's minds and liberate them from religious, philosophic and scientiÆc dogma and tradition. They leave the world not surer, but freer than when they entered it. Some men seek to Ænd the truth by imaginative perception. It is a good instrument like logic, but like logic it breaks down before it reaches the goal. Neither ought to be allowed to do more than take us some way and then leave us. Others think that a Æne judgment can arrive at the true balance. It does, for a time; but the next generation upsets that Æne balancing, consenting to a coarser test or demanding a Æner. The religious prefer inspiration, but inspiration is like the lightning, brilliantly illuminating only a given reach of country and leaving the rest in darkness intensiÆed by the sharpness of that light. Vast is our error if we mistake that bit of country for the whole universe. Is there then no instrument of knowledge that can give us the heart of truth and provide us with the key word of existence? I think there is, but the evolution of mankind at large yet falls far short of it; their highest tread only on the border of that illumination. After all pure intellect carries us very high. But neither the scorner of pure intellectual ideation, nor its fanatic and devotee can attain to the knowledge in which not only the senses reØect or the mind thinks about things, but the ideal faculty directly knows them."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Siddhis Some men sneer at the Siddhis because they do not believe in them, others because they think it is noble and spiritual to de- spise them. Both attitudes proceed from ignorance. It is true that to some natures the rule of omne ignotum pro magniÆco holds and everything that is beyond their knowledge is readily accepted as true marvel and miracle, and of such a temper are the credulous made, it is also true that to others it is omne ignotum pro falso and they cannot forbear ridiculing as fraud or pitiable superstition everything that is outside the reach of their philosophy. This is the temper of the incredulous. But the true temper is to be neither credulous nor incredulous, but calmly and patiently to inquire. Let the inquiry be scrupulous, but also scrupulously fair on both sides. Some think it shows superior rationality, even when they inquire, to be severe, and by that they mean to seize every opportunity of disproving the phenomenon offered to their attention. Such an attitude is good rather for limiting knowledge than increasing it. If it saves us from some errors of assertion, it betrays us into many errors of negation and postpones developments of the utmost importance to our human advance. I do not wish to argue the question of the existence or nonex- istence of Yogic siddhis; for it is not with me a question of debate, or of belief and disbelief, since I know by daily experience that they exist. I am concerned rather with their exact nature and utility. And here one is met by the now fashionable habit, among people presuming to be Vedantic and spiritual, of a denunciation and holy horror of the Yogic siddhis. They are, it seems, Tantric, dangerous, immoral, delusive as conjuring tricks, a stumbling block in the path of the soul's liberation. Swami Vivekananda did much to encourage this attitude by his eagerness to avoid all mention of them at the outset of his mission in order not to"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Siddhis 15 startle the incredulity of the Europeans. ™These things are true∫ he said, ™but let them lie hidden.∫ And now many who have not the motives of Vivekananda, think that they can ape his spiritual greatness by imitating his limitations. There was no such weakness in the robust temperament of our forefathers. Our great Rishis of old did not cry out upon Siddhis, but recognised them as a part, though not the most important part of Yogic accomplishment, and used them with an abundant and unhesitating vigour. They are recognised in our sacred books, formally included in Yoga by so devotional a Purana as the Bhagawat, noted and some of their processes carefully tabled by Patanjali. Even in the midnight of the Kali great Siddhas and saints have used them more sparingly, but with power and effectiveness. It would be difÆcult for many of them to do otherwise than use the siddhis since by the very fact of their spiritual elevation, these powers have become not exceptional movements, but the ordinary processes of their thought and action. It is by the use of the siddhis that the Siddhas sitting on the mountains help the world out of the heart of their solitude and silence. Jesus Christ made the use of the siddhis a prominent feature of his pure, noble and spiritual life, nor did he hesitate to communicate them to his disciples – the laying of hands, the healing of the sick, the ashirvada, the abhishap, the speaking with many tongues were all given to them. The day of Pentecost is still kept holy by the Christian Church. Joan of Arc used her siddhis to liberate France. Socrates had his siddhis, some of them of a very material nature. Men of great genius are usually born with some of them and use them unconsciously. Even in natures far below the power and clarity of genius we see their occasional or irregular operation. The West, always avid of knowledge, is struggling, sadly hampered by misuse and imposture, to develop them and gropes roughly for the truth about them in the phe- nomena of hypnotism, clairvoyance, telepathy, vouched for by men and women of great intellectuality and sincerity. Returning Eastwards, where only their right practice has been understood, the lives of our saints northern and southern are full of the record of Siddhis. Sri Ramakrishna, whose authority is quoted against"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 Essays Divine and Human them, not only made inward use of them but manifested them with no inconsiderable frequency in His lila. I see nothing in this long record immoral, dangerous or frivolous. But because Europe looks with scorn and incredulity on these ™miracles∫ and this ™magic∫, we too must needs be ashamed of them, hustle them into the background and plead that only a few charlatans and followers of false paths profess their use. But as for us, we are men of intellect and spirituality, ascetics, devotees, self-deniers, Vedantins; for these things we are too high and we leave them to Theosophists, immoral Tantrics and deluded pseudo-Yogins. Let us have done with cant and pretension in all matters. There are no such things as miracles in this world of divine processes, for either there is no such thing as a miracle or, if we consider more closely, everything in this world is a miracle. A miracle is, literally, a marvel, a thing to be wondered at – so long as the process is [not] known. Wireless telegraphy is a great marvel, the speechless passage of a thought from brain to brain is a yet greater, yet it happens daily even in the most commonplace minds and existences. But when the process is known, nothing is left to be wondered at except the admirable greatness of wisdom, width & variety of conception & subtlety & minuteness in execution with which this universe is managed. And even that wonder ceases when we know God and realise that the most wonderful movements of the cosmos are but triØes and ™conjuring-tricks∫ compared with His inÆnite Reality. And as it is with this siddhi of science which we call wireless telegra- phy and with this other siddhi of nature which is exampled in the momentary or rapid spread of a single thought or emotion in a mob, a nation, an army, so it is with the Yogic siddhis. Explain & master their processes, put them in their proper relation to the rest of the economy of the universe and we shall Ænd that they are neither miraculous nor marvellous nor supernatural. They are supernormal only in the way in which aviation is supernormal or motoring or the Chinese alphabet.

The Veda is our oldest extant human document and the Veda, from one point of view, is a great compilation of practical hints about Yoga. All religion is a Øower of which Yoga is the root; all philosophy, poetry & the works of genius use it, consciously or unconsciously, as an instrument. We believe that God created the world by Yoga and by Yoga He will draw it into Himself again. Yogah prabhavapyayau, Yoga is the birth and passing away of things. When Srikrishna reveals to Arjuna the greatness of His creation and the manner in which He has built it out of His being by a reconciliation of logical opposites, he says ™Pasya me yogam aishwaram∫, Behold my divine Yoga. We usually attach a more limited sense to the word; when we use or hear it, we think of the details of Patanjali's system, of rhythmic breathing, of peculiar ways of sitting, of concentration of mind, of the trance of the adept. But these are merely details of particular systems. The systems are not the thing itself, any more than the water of an irrigation canal is the river Ganges. Yoga may be done without the least thought for the breathing, in any posture or no posture, without any insistence on concentration, in the full waking condition, while walking, working, eating, drinking, talking with others, in any occupation, in sleep, in dream, in states of unconsciousness, semiconsciousness, double-consciousness. It is no nostrum or system or Æxed practice, but an eternal fact of process based on the very nature of the Universe. Nevertheless in practice the name may be limited to certain applications of this general process for speciÆc and deÆnite ends.

So long as the body and the vital desires are active the mind is necessarily distracted and it is only when the body is forgotten and the vital part consents to quietude that a man can concentrate himself in thought and follow undisturbed the consecutive development whether of a train of reasoning or a train of inspiration. Not only is this so, but the higher faculties of the mind can only work at their best when the lower are quieted. If the accumulations in the chitta, the recording part of the mind, are continually active, full as it is of preconceived ideas, prejudices, predilections, the great mass of previous san- skaras , the reØective mind which is ordinarily called the reason is obstructed in its work and comes to false conclusions. It is essential for the faculties of the reason to be freed as far as may be from this ever increasing accumulation of thought-sensations good and bad, false and true which we call mind – manas. It is this freedom which is called the scientiÆc spirit. To form no con- clusions which are not justiÆed by observation and reasoning, to doubt everything until it is proved but to deny nothing until it is disproved, to be always ready to reconsider old conclusions in the light of new facts, to give a candid consideration to every new idea or old idea revived if it deserves a hearing, no matter how contradictory it may be of previously ascertained experience or previously formed conclusion, is the sceptical temper, the temper"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24 Essays Divine and Human of the inquirer, the true scientist, the untrammelled thinker. The interference of prejudgment and predilection means bondage and until the higher mind has shaken off these fetters, it is not free; it works in chains, it sees in blinkers. This is as true of the materialist refusing to consider spiritualism and occultism as it is of the religionist refusing to consider Science. Freedom is the Ærst requisite of full working power, the freedom of the higher from the lower. The mind must be free from the body if it is to be puriÆed from the grossness which clogs its motions, the heart must be free from the obsessions of the body if love and high aspiration are to increase, the reason must be free from the heart and the lower mind if it is to reØect perfectly, – for the heart can inspire, it cannot think, it is a vehicle of direct knowledge coloured by emotion, not of ratiocination. By [a] similar process if there is anything higher than the reason it can only be set free to work by the stillness of the whole mind not excluding the reØective faculties. This is a conclusion from analogy, indeed, and not entirely binding until conÆrmed by experience and observation. But we have given reason in past articles for supposing that there is a higher force than the logical reason – and the experience and observation of Yoga conÆrm the inference from analogy that the stillness of the mind is the Ærst requisite for discovering, distinguishing and perfecting the action of this higher element in the psychology of man. The stillness of the mind is prepared by the process of con- centration. In the science of Rajayoga after the heart has been stilled and the mind prepared, the next step is to subjugate the body by means of asan or the Æxed and motionless seat. The aim of this Æxity is twofold, Ærst the stillness of the body and secondly the forgetfulness of the body. When one can sit still and utterly forget the body for a long period of time, then the asan is said to have been mastered. In ordinary concentration when the body is only comparatively still it is not noticed, but there is an undercurrent of physical consciousness which may surge up at any moment into the upper current of thought and disturb it. The Yogin seeks to make the forgetfulness perfect. In the higher processes of concentration this forgetfulness reaches such a point"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Na Kinchidapi Chintayet 25 that the bodily consciousness is annulled and in the acme of the samadhi a man can be cut or burned without being aware of the physical suffering. Even before the concentration is begun the forgetfulness acquired is sufÆcient to prevent any intrusion upon the mind except under a more than ordinarily powerful physical stimulus. After this point has been reached the Yoga proceeds to the processes of pranayam by which the whole system is cleared of impurities and the pranasakti , the great cosmic energy which lies behind all processes of Nature, Ælls the body and the brain and becomes sufÆcient for any work of which man is actually or potentially capable. This is followed by concentration. The Ærst process is to withdraw the senses into the mind. This is partly done in the ordinary process of absorption of which every thinking man is capable. To concentrate upon the work in hand whether it be a manual process, a train of thought, a scientiÆc experiment or a train of inspiration, is the Ærst condition of complete capacity and it is the process by which mankind has been preparing itself for Yoga. To concentrate means to be ab- sorbed; but absorption may be more or less complete. When it is so complete that for all practical purposes the knowledge of outward things ceases, then the Ærst step has been taken to- wards Yogic absorption. We need not go into the stages of that absorption rising from pratyahar to samadhi and from the lower samadhi to the higher. The principle is to intensify absorption. It is intensiÆed in quality by the entire cessation of outward knowledge, the senses are withdrawn into the mind, the mind into the buddhi or supermind, the supermind into Knowledge, Vijnana, Mahat, out of which all things proceed and in which all things exist. It is intensiÆed in quantity or content; instead of absorption in a set of thoughts or a train of intuitions, the Yogin concentrates his absorption on a single thought, a single image, a single piece of knowledge, and it is his experience that whatever he thus concentrates on, he masters, – he becomes its lord and does with it what he wills. By knowledge he attains to mastery of the world. The Ænal goal of Rajayoga is the annulment of sep- arate consciousness and complete communion with that which alone is whether we call Him Parabrahman or Parameshwara,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"26 Essays Divine and Human Existence in the Highest or Will in the Highest, the Ultimate or God. In the Gita we have a process which is not the process of Raja-Yoga. It seeks a short cut to the common aim and goes straight to the stillness of the mind. After putting away desire and fear the Yogin sits down and performs upon his thoughts a process of reining in by which they get accustomed to an inward motion. Instead of allowing the mind to Øow outward, he compels it to rise and fall within, and if he sees, hears, feels or smells outward objects he pays no attention to them and draws the mind always inward. This process he pursues until the mind ceases to send up thoughts connected with outward things. The result is that fresh thoughts do not accumulate in the chitta at the time of meditation, but only the old ones rise. If the process be farther pursued by rejecting these thoughts as they rise in the mind, in other words by dissociating the thinker from the mind, the operator from the machine and refusing to sanction the continuance of the machine's activity, the result is perfect stillness. This can be done if the thinker whose interest is necessary to the mind, refuses to be interested and becomes passive. The mind goes on for a while by its own impetus just as a locomotive does when the steam is shut off, but a time must come when it will slow down and stop altogether. This is the moment towards which the process moves. Na kinchid api chintayet: – the Yogin should not think of anything at all. Blank cessation of mental activity is aimed at leaving only the sakshi, the witness watching for results. If at this moment the Yogin entrusts himself to the guidance of the universal Teacher within himself, Yoga will fulÆl itself without any farther effort on his part. The passivity will be conÆrmed, the higher faculties will awake and the cosmic Force passing down from the vijnana through the supermind will take charge of the whole machine and direct its workings as the InÆnite Lord of All may choose. Whichever of the two methods be chosen, the result is the same. The mind is stilled, the higher faculties awakened. This stillness of the mind is not altogether a new idea or peculiar to India. The old Highland poets had the secret. When they wished"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Na Kinchidapi Chintayet 27 to compose poetry, they Ærst stilled the mind, became entirely passive and waited for the inspiration to Øow into them. This habit of yogic passivity, a relic doubtless of the discipline of the Druids, was the source of those faculties of second sight and other psychic powers which are so much more common in this Celtic race than in the other peoples of Europe. The phenomena of inspiration are directly connected with these higher faculties of which we Ænd rudiments or sporadic traces in the past history of human experience."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Sources of Poetry The swiftness of the muse has been embodied in the image of Pegasus, the heavenly horse of Greek legend; it was from the rapid beat of his hoofs on the rock that Hippocrene Øowed. The waters of Poetry Øow in a current or a torrent; where there is a pause or a denial, it is a sign of obstruction in the stream or of imperfection in the mind which the waters have chosen for their bed and continent. In India we have the same idea; Saraswati is for us the goddess of poetry, and her name means the stream or ™she who has Øowing motion∫. But even Saraswati is only an intermediary. Ganga is the real mother of inspiration, she who Øows impetuously down from the head of Mahadev, God high- seated, over the Himalay of the mind to the homes and cities of men. All poetry is an inspiration, a thing breathed into the thinking organ from above; it is recorded in the mind, but is born in the higher principle of direct knowledge or ideal vision which surpasses mind. It is in reality a revelation. The prophetic or revealing power sees the substance; the inspiration perceives the right expression. Neither is manufactured; nor is poetry really a poiesis or composition, nor even a creation, but rather the revelation of something that eternally exists. The ancients knew this truth and used the same word for poet and prophet, creator and seer, sophos , vates , kavi . But there are differences in the manifestation. The greatest motion of poetry comes when the mind is still and the ideal principle works above and outside the brain, above even the hundred petalled lotus of the ideal mind, in its proper empire; for then it is Veda that is revealed, the perfect substance and ex- pression of eternal truth. This higher ideation transcends genius just as genius transcends ordinary intellect and perception. But that great faculty is still beyond the normal level of our evolu- tion. Usually we see the action of the revelation and inspiration"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Sources of Poetry 29 reproduced by a secondary, diluted and uncertain process in the mind. But even this secondary and inferior action is so great that it can give us Shakespeare, Homer and Valmekie. There is also a tertiary and yet more common action of the inspiration. For of our three mental instruments of knowledge, – the heart or emotionally realising mind, the observing and reasoning intellect with its aids, fancy and memory, and the intuitive intellect, – it is into the last and highest that the ideal principle transmits its inspirations when the greatest poetry writes itself out through the medium of the poet. But if the intuitive intellect is not strong enough to act habitually, it is better for the poetry to descend into the heart and return to the intellect suffused and coloured with passion and emotion than to be formed directly in the observing intellect. Poetry written from the reasoning intellect is apt to be full of ingenious conceits, logic, argumentation, rhetorical turns, orna- mental fancies, echoes learned and imitative rather than uplifted and transformed. This is what is sometimes called classical po- etry, the vigorous and excellent but unemotional and unuplifted poetry of Pope and Dryden. It has its inspiration, its truth and value; it is admirable in its way, but it is only great when it is lifted out of itself into intuitive writing or else invaded by the heart. For everything that needs Ære rather than light, driving- force rather than clearness, enthusiasm rather than correctness, the heart is obviously the more potent instrument. Now, poetry to be great must have either enthusiasm or ecstasy. Yet the poetry that rises up from the heart is usually a turbid stream; our own restless ideas and imaginations mix with the pure inrush from above a turbulent uprush from below, our excited emotions seek an exaggerated expression, our aesthetic habits and predilections busy themselves to demand a satisfac- tion greatly beyond their due. Such poetry may be inspired, but it is not always suitable or inevitable. There is often a double inspiration, the higher or ecstatic and the lower or emotional, and the lower disturbs and drags down the higher. This is the birth of romantic or excessively exuberant poetry, too rich in expression, too abundant and redundant in substance. The best"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30 Essays Divine and Human poetry coming straight from the right centres may be bare and strong, unadorned and lofty, or it may be rich and splendid; it may be at will romantic or classical; but it will always be felt to be the right thing for its purpose; it is always nobly or rapturously inevitable. But even in the higher centres of the intuitive intellect there may be defects in the inspiration. There is a kind of false Øu- ency which misses the true language of poetry from dulness of perception. Under the impression that it is true and inspired writing it Øows with an imperturbable Øatness, saying the thing that should be said but not in the way that it should be said, without force and felicity. This is the tamasic or clouded stimu- lus, active, but full of unenlightenment and self-ignorance. The thing seen is right and good; accompanied with the inspired expression it would make very noble poetry. Instead, it becomes prose rendered unnatural and difÆcult to tolerate by being cut up into lengths. Wordsworth is the most characteristic and inter- esting victim of tamasic stimulus. Other great poets fall a prey to it, but that superb and imperturbable self-satisfaction under the inØiction is his alone. There is another species of tamasic stimulus which transmits an inspired and faultless expression, but the substance is neither interesting to man nor pleasing to the gods. A good deal of Milton comes under this category. In both cases what has happened is that either the inspiration or the revelation has been active, but its companion activity has refused to associate itself in the work. It is when the mind works at the form and substance of poetry without either the revelation or the inspiration from above that respectable or minor poetry is produced. Judgment, memory and imagination may work, command of language may be there, but without that secondary action of a higher than intellectual force, it is labour wasted, work that earns respect but not immortality. Doggerel and bastard poetry take their rise not even in the observing intellect but from the sensational mind or the passive memory guided only by the mere physical pleasure of sound and emotion. It is bold, blatant, external, imitative, vulgar; its range of intellectuality and imaginativeness"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Sources of Poetry 31 cannot go beyond the vital impulse and the vital delight. But even in the sensational mind there is the possibility of a remote action from the ideal self; for even to the animals who think sensationally only, God has given revelations and inspirations which we call instincts. Under such circumstances even bastard poetry may have a kind of worth, a kind of inevitability. The poet in the sensational man may be entirely satisÆed and delighted, and even in the more developed human being the sensational element may Ænd a poetical satisfaction not of the highest. The best ballad poetry and Macaulay's lays are instances in point. Scott is a sort of link between sensational and intellectual poetry. While there are men mainly sensational, secondarily intellectual and not at all ideal, he will always be admired. Another kind of false inspiration is the rajasic or Æery stim- ulus. It is not Øat and unproÆtable like the tamasic, but hasty, impatient and vain. It is eager to avoid labour by catching at the second best expression or the incomplete vision of the idea, insufÆciently jealous to secure the best form, the most satisfy- ing substance. Rajasic poets, even when they feel the defect in what they have written, hesitate to sacriÆce it because they also feel and are attached either to what in it is valuable or to the memory of their delight when it was Ærst written. If they get a better expression or a fuller sight, they often prefer to reiterate rather than strike out inferior stuff with which they are in love. Sometimes, drifting or struggling helplessly along that shallow and vehement current, they vary one idea or harp on the same imagination without any Ænal success in expressing it inevitably. Examples of the rajasic stimulus are commonest in Shelley and Spenser, but few English poets are free from it. This is the rajasic fault in expression. But the Æery stimulus also perverts or ham- pers the substance. An absence of self-restraint, an unwillingness to restrict and limit the ideas and imaginations is a sure sign of a rajasic ideality. There is an attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of the subject, to expand and multiply thoughts and imaginative visions beyond the bounds of the right and permissible. Or else the true idea is rejected or fatally anticipated by another which is or seems to be more catching and boldly effective. Keats is"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32 Essays Divine and Human the principle exemplar of the Ærst tendency, the Elizabethans of the second. The earlier work of Shakespeare abounds with classical instances. As distinguished from the Greek, English is a pronouncedly rajasic literature and, though there is much in it that is more splendid than almost anything done by the Greeks, – more splendid, not better, – a great deal even of its admired portions are rather rich or meretricious than great and true. The perfect inspiration in the intuitive intellect is the sattwic or luminous inspiration, which is disinterested, self-contained, yet at will noble, rich or vigorous, having its eye only on the right thing to be said and the right way to say it. It does not allow its perfection to be interfered with by emotion or eager- ness, but this does not shut it out from ecstasy and exaltation. On the contrary, its delight of self-enjoyment is a purer and more exquisite enthusiasm than that which attends any other inspiration. It commands and uses emotion without enslaving itself to it. There is indeed a sattwic stimulus which is attached to its own luminosity, limpidity and steadiness, and avoids rich- ness, force or emotion of a poignant character even when these are needed and appropriate. The poetry of Matthew Arnold is often though not always of this character. But this is a limited inspiration. Sattwic as well as rajasic poetry may be written from the uninspired intellect, but the sensational mind never gives birth to sattwic poetry. One thing has to be added. A poet need not be a reØective critic; he need not have the reasoning and analysing intellect and dissect his own poetry. But two things he must have in some measure to be perfect, the intuitive judgment which shows him at a glance whether he has got the best or the second-best idea, the perfect or the imperfect expression and rhythm, and the intuitive reason which shows him without analysis why or wherein it is best or second-best, perfect or imperfect. These four faculties, revelation or prophecy, inspiration, intuitive judgment and intuitive reason, are the perfect equipment of genius doing the works of interpretative & creative knowledge."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Interpretation of Scripture The spirit who lies concealed behind the material world, has given us, through the inspiration of great seers, the Scriptures as helpers and guides to unapparent truth, lamps of great power that send their rays into the darkness of the unknown beyond which He dwells, tamasah parastat . They are guides to knowl- edge, brief indications to enlighten us on our path, not substi- tutes for thought and experience. They are shabdam Brahma , the Word, the oral expression of God, not the thing to be known itself nor the knowledge of Him. Shabdam has three elements, the word, the meaning and the spirit. The word is a symbol, vak or nama ; we have to Ænd the artha , the meaning or form of thought which the symbol indicates. But the meaning itself is only the indication of something deeper which the thought seeks to convey to the intellectual conception. For not only words, but ideas also are eventually no more than symbols of a knowledge which is beyond ideas and words. Therefore it comes that no idea by itself is wholly true. There is indeed a rupa , some concrete or abstract form of knowledge, answering to every name, and it is that which the meaning must present to the intellect. We say a form of knowledge, because according to our philosophy, all things are forms of an essentially unknowable existence which reveals them as forms of knowledge to the essential awareness in its Self, its Atman or Spirit, the Chit in the Sat. But beyond nama and rupa is swarupa , the essential Ægure of Truth, which we cannot know with the intellect, but only with a higher faculty. And every swarupa is itself only a symbol of the one essential existence which can only be known by its symbols because in its ultimate reality it deÆes logic and exceeds perception, – God.

He must not be one who will rest content in the thought-symbol or in the logical implications of the idea; he must hunger and thirst for what is beyond. The interpreter who stops short with the letter, is the slave of a symbol and convicted of error. The interpreter who cannot go beyond the external meaning, is the prisoner of his thought and rests in a partial and incomplete knowledge. One must transgress limits & penetrate to the knowledge behind, which must be experienced before it can be known; for the ear hears it, the intellect observes it, but the spirit alone can possess it. Realisation in the self of things is the only knowledge; all else is mere idea or opinion. The interpretation of the Veda is hampered by many hu- man irrelevancies. Men set up an authority and put it between themselves and knowledge. The orthodox are indignant that a mere modern should presume to differ from Shankara in inter- preting the Vedanta or from Sayana in interpreting the Veda. They forget that Shankara and Sayana are themselves moderns, separated from ourselves by some hundreds of years only, but the Vedas are many thousands of years old. The commentator ought to be studied, but instead we put him in place of the text. Good commentaries are always helpful even when they are wrong, but the best cannot be allowed to fetter inquiry. Sayana's commentary on the Veda helps me by showing what a man of great erudition some hundreds of years ago thought to be the sense of the Scripture. But I cannot forget that even at the time of the Brahmanas the meaning of the Veda had become dark to the men of that prehistoric age. Shankara's commentary on the Upanishads helps me by showing what a man of immense metaphysical genius and rare logical force after arriving at some fundamental realisations thought to be the sense of the Vedanta. But it is evident that he is often at a loss and always prepossessed by the necessity of justifying his philosophy. I Ænd that Shankara had grasped much of Vedantic truth, but that much was dark to him. I am bound to admit what he realised; I am not bound to exclude what he failed to realise.

It is enough for them that Max Muller should have found henotheism in the Vedas for the Vedas to be henothe- istic.

We should come back to a more Øexible and rational spirit of inquiry. What then are the standards of truth in the interpretation of the Scripture? The standards are three, the knower, knowledge and the known. The known is the text itself that we seek to interpret. We must be sure we have the right word, not an emendation to suit the exigency of some individual or sectarian opinion; the right etymology and shade of meaning, not one that is traditional or forced to serve the ends of a commentator; the right spirit in the sense, not an imported or too narrow or too elastic spirit. The knower is the original drashta or seer of the mantra , with whom we ought to be in spiritual contact. If knowledge is indeed a perishable thing in a perishable instrument, such contact is impossible; but in that case the Scripture itself must be false and not worth considering. If there is any truth in what the Scripture says, knowledge is eternal and inherent in all of us and what another saw I can see, what another realised I can realise. The drashta was a soul in relation with the inÆnite Spirit, I am also a soul in relation with the inÆnite Spirit. We have a meeting-place, a possibility of communion. Knowledge is the eternal truth, part of which the drashta expresses to us. Through the part he shows us, we must travel to the whole, otherwise we shall be subject to the errors incidental to an imperfect knowledge. If even the part is to be rightly understood, it must be viewed in the terms of the whole, not the whole in the terms of the part. I am not limited by the Scriptures; on the contrary I must exceed them in order to be master of their knowledge.

Admired for its rarity, brilliancy and potency, yet in practice and for the same qualities it is more generally dreaded, ridiculed or feared. There is no doubt that it tends to disturb what is established. Therefore tamasic men and tamasic states of society take especial pains to discourage independence of opinion. Their watchword is authority. Few societies have been so tamasic, so full of inertia and contentment in increasing narrowness as Indian society in later times; few have been so eager to preserve themselves in inertia. Few therefore have attached so great an importance to authority. Every detail of our life has been Æxed for us by Shastra and custom, every detail of our thought by Scripture and its commentators, – but much oftener by the commentators than by Scripture.

The most striking instance is our continued help- lessness in the face of the new conditions and new knowledge imposed on us by recent European contact. We have tried to assimilate, we have tried to reject, we have tried to select; but we have not been able to do any of these things successfully. Successful assimilation depends on mastery; but we have not mastered European conditions and knowledge, rather we have been seized, subjected and enslaved by them. Successful rejec- tion is possible only if we have intelligent possession of that which we wish to keep. Our rejection too must be an intel- ligent rejection; we must reject because we have understood, not because we have failed to understand. But our Hinduism, our old culture are precisely the possessions we have cherished with the least intelligence; throughout the whole range of our life we do things without knowing why we do them, we be- lieve things without knowing why we believe them, we assert things without knowing what right we have to assert them, – or, at most, it is because some book or some Brahmin en- joins it, because Shankara thinks it, or because someone has so interpreted something that he asserts to be a fundamental Scripture of our religion. Nothing is our own, nothing native to our intelligence, all is derived. As little have we understood the new knowledge; we have only understood what the Eu- ropeans want us to think about themselves and their modern civilisation.

If we receive them in the light given by our previous knowledge, which was on so many points nil, we shall as blindly and foolishly reject.

Yet it is only by mastering the life and heart of things that we can hope, as a nation, to survive. How shall we recover our lost intellectual freedom and elas- ticity? By reversing, for a time at least, the process by which we lost it, by liberating our minds in all subjects from the thraldom to authority. That is not what reformers and the Anglicised re- quire of us. They ask us, indeed, to abandon authority, to revolt against custom and superstition, to have free and enlightened minds. But they mean by these sounding recommendations that we should renounce the authority of Sayana for the authority of Max Muller, the Monism of Shankara for the Monism of Haeckel, the written Shastra for the unwritten law of European social opinion, the dogmatism of Brahmin Pandits for the dog- matism of European scientists, thinkers and scholars. Such a foolish exchange of servitude can receive the assent of no self- respecting mind. Let us break our chains, venerable as they are, but let it be in order to be free, – in the name of truth, not in the name of Europe. It would be a poor bargain to exchange our old Indian illuminations, however dark they may have grown to us, for a derivative European enlightenment or replace the supersti- tions of popular Hinduism by the superstitions of materialistic Science.

Let our brains no longer, like European"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"On Original Thinking 41 infants, be swathed with swaddling clothes; let them recover the free and unbound motion of the gods; let them have not only the minuteness but the wide mastery and sovereignty natural to the intellect of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustoms itself to feel its own power and be convinced of its own worth. If it cannot entirely shake off past shackles, let it at least arise like the infant Krishna bound to the wain, and move forward dragging with it wain and all and shattering in its progress the twin trees, the twin obstacles to self-fulÆlment, blind mediaeval prejudice and arrogant modern dogmatism. The old Æxed foundations have been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and change. It is no use clinging to the old ice-Øoes of the past, they will soon melt and leave their refugees struggling in perilous waters. It is no use landing ourselves in the inÆrm bog, neither sea nor good dry land, of a secondhand Europeanism. We shall only die there a miserable and unclean death. No, we must learn to swim and use that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land again on the eternal rock of ages. Let us not, either, select at random, make a nameless hotch- potch and then triumphantly call it the assimilation of East and West. We must begin by accepting nothing on trust from any source whatsoever, by questioning everything and forming our own conclusions. We need not fear that we shall by that pro- cess cease to be Indians or fall into the danger of abandoning Hinduism. India can never cease to be India or Hinduism to be Hinduism, if we really think for ourselves. It is only if we allow Europe to think for us that India is in danger of becoming an ill-executed and foolish copy of Europe. We must not begin by becoming partisans but know before we take our line. Our Ærst business as original thinkers will be to accept nothing, to question everything. That means to get rid of all unexamined opinions old or new, all mere habitual sanskaras in the mind, to have no preconceived judgments. Anityah sarvasanskarah, said the Buddha. I do not know that I quite agree. There are certain sanskaras that seem to me as eternal as things can be. What is the Atman itself but an eternal and fundamental way of"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42 Essays Divine and Human looking at things, the essentiality of all being in itself unknow- able, neti, neti. Therefore the later Buddhists declared that the Atman itself did not exist and arrived at ultimate nothingness, a barren and foolish conclusion, since Nothingness itself is only a sanskara. Nevertheless it is certain that the great mass of our habitual conceptions are not only temporary, but imperfect and misleading. We must escape from these imperfections and take our stand on that which is true and lasting. But in order to Ænd out what in our conceptions is true and lasting, we must question all alike rigorously and impartially. The necessity of such a process not for India, but for all humanity has been recognised by leading European thinkers. It was what Carlyle meant when he spoke of swallowing all formulas. It was the pro- cess by which Goethe helped to reinvigorate European thinking. But in Europe the stream is running dry before it has reached its sea. Europe has for some time ceased to produce original thinkers, though it still produces original mechanicians. Science preserves her freedom of inquiry in details, in the mint and anise and cummin of the world's processes, but, bound hand & foot in the formulas of the past, she is growing helpless for great ideas and sound generalisations. She sits contented with her treasuries; she has combed all the pebbles on the seashore and examined the shoreward gulfs and bays; of the oceans beyond and their undiscovered continents she cries scornfully ™They are a dream; there is nothing there but mists mistaken for land or a waste of the same waters that we have already here ex- amined.∫ Europe is becoming stereotyped and unprogressive; she is fruitful only of new & ever multiplying luxuries and of feverish, Æery & ineffective changes in her political and social machinery. China, Japan and the Mussulman States are slid- ing into a blind European imitativeness. In India alone there is self-contained, dormant, the energy and the invincible spiritual individuality which can yet arise and break her own and the world's fetters. It is true that original thinking makes for original acting, and therefore a caution is necessary. We must be careful that our thinking is not only original but thorough before we even initiate"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"On Original Thinking 43 action. To run away with an isolated original idea, or charmed with its newness and vigour, to ride it into the Æeld of action is to make of ourselves cranks and eccentrics. This world, this society, these nations and their civilisations are not simple existences, but complex & intricate, the result of a great organic growth in many centuries, sometimes in many millenniums. We should not deal with them after snatching at a few hurried generalisations or in the gust and fury of a stiff fanaticism. We must Ærst be sure that our new thought is wide and strong-winged enough, our thoughts large enough, our natures mighty enough to deal with those vastnesses. We must be careful, too, to comprehend what we destroy. And destroy we must not unless we have a greater and more perfect thing to put in the place even of a crumbling and mouldering antiquity. To tear down Hindu society in the spirit of the social reformers or European society in the spirit of the philosophical or unphilosophical Anarchists would be to destroy order and substitute a licentious confusion. If we carefully remember these cautions, there is no harm in original thinking even of the boldest and most merciless novelty. I may, for example, attack unsparingly the prevailing system of justice and punishment as extraordinarily senseless and evil, even if I have no new system ready-made to put in as its successor; but I must have no wish to destroy it, senseless & evil though it be, until our new system is ready. For it Ælls a place the vacancy of which the Spirit that uplifts & supports our human welfare, would greatly abhor. I may expose, too, the weaknesses and nar- rownesses of an existing form of religion, even if I have no new & better form to preach of my own, but I must not so rage against those weaknesses as to destroy all religious faith and I should remember before the end of my criticism that even a bad religion is better than no religion, – that it is wiser to worship energy in my surroundings with the African savage than to be dead to all faith and all spirituality like the drunkards of a little knowledge – for even in that animal and unintelligent worship there is a spark of the divine Ære which keeps humanity living, while the cultured imperial Roman or the luxurious modern wealth- gatherer and body worshipper drags his kind into a straight"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44 Essays Divine and Human & well built road which is so broad only to lead more eas- ily to a mighty perdition – na ched ihavedin mahati vinashtih . Otherwise there is no harm in spreading dissatisfaction with fetish worship or refusing praise to an ancient and cruel folly. We need not be troubled if our thinking is condemned as too radical or even as reckless & revolutionary, – for the success of revolutionary thought always means that Nature has need of one of her cataclysms; even otherwise, she will make of it whatever modiÆed use is best for our present humanity. In thought as in deeds, to the thinking we have a right, the result belongs to the wise & active Power of God that stands over us & in us originating, cherishing, indefatigably dissolving & remoulding man and spirit in the progressive harmonies of His universe. Let us only strive that our light should be clear, diffused & steady, not either darkness or a narrow glare and merely violent lustre. And if we cannot compass that ideal, still it is better to think than to cease from thinking. For even out of darkness the day is born and lightning has its uses! [Draft opening of another version] We have had recently in India a great abundance of speculations on the real causes of that gradual decline and Ænal arrest which Indian civilisation no less than European suffered during the Middle Ages. The arrest was neither so sudden as in Europe nor so complete; but its effect on our nation, like the undermining activity of a slow poison, was all the more profoundly destruc- tive, pervasive, hard to remedy, difÆcult to expel. At a certain period we entered into a decline, splendid at Ærst like a long and gorgeous sunset, afterwards more & more sombre, till the darkness closed in, and if our sky was strewn with stars of a great number & brilliance, it was only a vast decay, confusion and inertia that they lighted and emphasised with their rays.

Such explanations, like most human thoughts, have their bright side of truth as well as their obscure side of error; but they are not, in any case, the result of impartial thinking. Man may be, as he has been deÆned, a reasoning animal, but it is necessary to add that he is, for the most part, a very badly-reasoning animal. He does not ordinarily think for the sake of Ænding out the truth, but much more for the satisfaction of his mental preferences and emo- tional tendencies; his conclusions spring from his preferences, prejudices and passions; and his reasoning & logic paraded to justify them are only a specious process or a formal mask for his covert approach to an upshot previously necessitated by his heart or by his temperament. When we are awakened from our modern illusions, as we have been awakened from our mediaeval superstitions, we shall Ænd that the intellectual conclusions of the rationalist for all their [... ] pomp & profuse apparatus of scrupulous enquiry were as much dogmas as those former dicta of Pope & theologian, which confessed without shame their simple basis in the negation of reason. Much more do all those current opinions demand scrutiny & modiÆcation, which express our personal view of things and rest patently on a partial and partisan view or have been justiÆed by preferential selection of the few data that suited our foregone & desired conclusion. It is always best, therefore, to scrutinise very narrowly those bare, trenchant explanations which so easily satisfy the pugnacious animal in our intellects; when we have admitted that small part of the truth on which they seize, we should always look for the large part which they have missed.

Europe, even while vaunting a monopoly of civilisation, cherishes and preens herself in some remarkable relics of bar- barism. In mediaeval times, with the scientiÆc thoroughness and efÆciency which she shares with the Mongolian, she organised torture as the most reliable source of evidence and the ordeal of battle as the surest guide to judicial truth. Both ideas were characteristically European. A later age may seem to have got rid of these luminous methods, but it is not so in reality. In place of the rack the French have invented the investigating judge and the Americans some remarkable processes, which I think they call questioning (the old name for torture) in the Ærst, second and up to the Æfth degree if not to higher stages of excellence. The torture is sometimes of the mind not of the body; it is less intense, more lingering, but it leads to the same result in the end. When the tortured wretch, after protecting with lies for as long as may be his guilt or his innocence, es- capes from his furious and pitiless persecutor by a true or false confession, preferring jail or the gallows to this prolongation of tense misery, the French call it delicately ™entering into the way of avowals∫. The Holy OfÆce in Seville could not have invented a more Christian and gentlemanly euphemism. The American system, is in the Æfth degree, I think, to keep the miserable accused fasting and sleepless and ply him with a ceaseless assault of torturing questions and suggestions until the brain reels, the body sinks, the heart is sick and hopeless and the man is ready to say anything his torturers believe or want to be the truth.

They have besides an honourable love of publicity and do not like, for themselves at least, secret police methods. They have rejected the investigating judge and torture in the Æfth degree. But their courts resemble the European. Under a civilised disguise these Courts are really the mediaeval ordeal by battle; only in place of the swords and lances of military combat- ants we have the tongues and technicalities of lawyers and the mutually tilting imaginations of witnesses. The victory is to the skilfullest liar and the most plausible workman in falsehoods and insincerities. It is largely an elaborate pitch and toss, an exhilarating gamble, a very Monte Carlo of surprising chances. But there is skill in it, too; it satisÆes the intellect as well as the sensations. One should rather call it a game of human Bridge which admirably combines luck and skill, or consider it as an intellectual gladiatorial show. In big cases the stake is worthy of the play and the excitement, a man's property or his life. But woe to the beaten! In a criminal case, the tortures of the jail or the terrifying drop from the gallows are in prospect, and it is rather the hardihood of guilt than the trembling consciousness of innocence that shall best help him. Woe to him if he is innocent! As he stands there, – for to add to the pleasurableness of his condition, the physical ache of hours of standing is considerately added to the cruel strain on his emotions, – he looks eagerly not to the truth or falsehood of the evidence for or against him, but to the skill with which this or that counsel handles the web of skilfully mixed truth and lies and the impression he is making on the judge or the jury. A true witness breaking down under a confusing cross-examination or a false witness mended by a judicious reexamination may be of much better service to him than the Truth, which, our Scriptures tell us, shall prevail and not falsehood, – eventually perhaps and in the things of the truth, but not in the things of falsehood, not in a court of Justice, not in the witness box.

The truth! Has not the Law expressly built up a hedge of technicalities to keep out the truth? As one looks on, one begins to understand the passion of the Roman poet's eulogy of the defence counsel, praesidium maestis reis , the bulwark of the sorrowful accused. For in this strange civilised gambling with human dice where it is so often impossible to be certain about guilt or innocence, one's sym- pathies naturally go to the sufferer, the scapegoat of a callous society, who may be moving to a long period of torturing and unmerited slavery or an undeserved death on the gallows. But if one could eliminate this element of human pity, it would be a real intellectual pleasure to watch the queer barbarous battle, appraise the methods of the chief players, admire, in whatever climes, the elusiveness and Æne casualness of Indian perjury or the robust manly cheery downrightness of Saxon cross-swearing. If the Courts convince us of our common humanity by making all men liars, they yet preserve a relishable unlikeness in like- ness. And I think that even theology or metaphysics does not give such admirable chances for subtlety as the Law, nor even Asiatic Research or ethnology favour so much the growth of that admirable scientiÆc faculty which deduces a whole animal out of some other animal's bone. If the thing proved is generally wrong, it is always ingenious; and after all in all these Æve sciences, or are they not rather arts? – it is not the thing that is true but the thing that is desired which must be established. This is perhaps why the Europeans think the system civilised, but as a semi- civilised Oriental, one would prefer less room for subtlety and more for truth. On the whole, if anyone were to complain that modern civilisation eliminates danger and excitement out of human life, we could well answer the morbid grumbler, ™Come into our Courts and see!∫ Still, praise must be given where praise is due, and let the English system once more be lauded for not normally exposing the accused to the torture of savage pursuit by a prosecuting judge or the singular revival in modern dress of the ancient ™question∫ by the American police.

Reform is sometimes the Ærst step to the abyss, but im- mobility is the most perfect way to stagnate and to putrefy. Neither is moderation always the wisest counsel: the mean is not always golden. It is often an euphemism for purblindness, for a tepid indifference or for a cowardly inefÆciency. Men call themselves moderates, conservatives or extremists and manage their conduct and opinions in accordance with a formula. We like to think by systems and parties and forget that truth is the only standard. Systems are merely convenient cases for keeping arranged knowledge, parties a useful machinery for combined action; but we make of them an excuse for avoiding the trouble of thought. One is astonished at the position of the orthodox. They labour to deify everything that exists. Hindu society has certain arrangements and habits which are merely customary. There is no proof that they existed in ancient times nor any reason why they should last into the future. It has other arrangements and habits for which textual authority can be quoted, but it is oftener the text of the modern Smritikaras than of Parasara and Manu. Our authority for them goes back to the last Æve hundred years. I do not understand the logic which argues that because a thing has lasted for Æve hundred years it must be perpetuated through the aeons. Neither antiquity nor modernity can be the test of truth or the test of usefulness. All the Rishis do not belong to the past; the Avatars still come; revelation still continues.

Well, but, if they are sacred, you must keep to the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Social Reform 51 whole and not cherish isolated texts while disregarding the body of your authority. You cannot pick and choose; you cannot say ™This is sacred and I will keep to it, that is less sacred and I will leave it alone.∫ When you so treat your sacred authority, you are proving that to you it has no sacredness. You are juggling with truth; for you are pretending to consult Manu when you are really consulting your own opinions, preferences or interests. To recreate Manu entire in modern society is to ask Ganges to Øow back to the Himalayas. Manu is no doubt national, but so is the animal sacriÆce and the burnt offering. Because a thing is national of the past, it need not follow that it must be national of the future. It is stupid not to recognise altered conditions. We have similar apologies for the unintelligent preserva- tion of mere customs; but, various as are the lines of defence, I do not know any that is imperiously conclusive. Custom is shishtachar , decorum, that which all well-bred and respectable people observe. But so were the customs of the far past that have been discontinued and, if now revived, would be severely discountenanced and, in many cases, penalised; so too are the customs of the future that are now being resisted or discouraged, – even, I am prepared to believe, the future no less than the past prepares for us new modes of living which in the present would not escape the censure of the law. It is the achar that makes the shishta , not the shishta who makes the achar .The achar is made by the rebel, the innovator, the man who is regarded in his own time as eccentric, disreputable or immoral, as was Sri Krishna by Bhurisrava because he upset the old ways and the old standards. Custom may be better defended as ancestral and therefore cherishable. But if our ancestors had persistently held that view, our so cherished customs would never have come into being. Or, more rationally, custom must be preserved because its long utility in the past argues a sovereign virtue for the preservation of society. But to all things there is a date and a limit. All long-continued customs have been sovereignly useful in their time, even totemism and polyandry.

One is repelled by the ignorant enthusiasm of social reformers. Their minds are usually a strange jumble of ill-digested European notions. Very few of them know anything about Europe, and even those who have visited it know it badly. But they will not allow things or ideas contrary to European notions to be anything but superstitious, barbarous, harmful and benighted, they will not suffer what is praised and practised in Europe to be anything but rational and enlightened. They are more appreciative than Occidentals themselves of the strength, knowledge and enjoyment of Europe; they are blinder than the blindest and most self-sufÆcient Anglo-Saxon to its weakness, ignorance and misery. They are charmed by the fair front Eu- rope presents to herself and the world; they are unwilling to discern any disease in the entrails, any foulness in the rear. For the Europeans are as careful to conceal their social as their physical bodies and shrink with more horror from nakedness and indecorum than from the reality of evil. If they see the latter in themselves, they avert their eyes, crying, ™It is nothing or it is little; we are healthy, we are perfect, we are immortal.∫ But the face and hands cannot always be covered, and we see blotches. The social reformer repeats certain stock arguments like shibboleths. For these antiquities he is a fanatic or a crusader. Usually he does not act up to his ideas, but in all sincerity he loves them and Æghts for them. He pursues his nostrums as panaceas; it would be inÆdelity to question or examine their efÆcacy.

Orthodox and reformer alike lose themselves in details; but it is principles that determine details. Almost every point that the social reformers raise could be settled one way or the other without effecting the permanent good of society. It is pitiful to see men labouring the point of marriage between subcastes and triumphing over an isolated instance. Whether the spirit as well as the body of caste should remain, is the modern question. Let Hindus remember that caste as it stands is merely jat , the trade guild sanctiÆed but no longer working, it is not the eternal reli- gion, it is not chaturvarnya . I do not care whether widows marry or remain single; but it is of inÆnite importance to consider how women shall be legally and socially related to man, as his inferior, equal or superior; for even the relation of superiority is no more impossible in the future than it was in the far-distant past. And the most important question of all is whether society shall be competitive or cooperative, individualistic or communistic. That we should talk so little about these things and be stormy over insigniÆcant details, shows painfully the impoverishment of the average Indian intellect. If these greater things are decided, as they must be, the smaller will arrange themselves. There are standards that are universal and there are stan- dards that are particular. At the present moment all societies are in need of reform, the Parsi, Mahomedan and Christian not a whit less than the Hindu which alone seems to feel the need of radical reformation. In the changes of the future the Hindu society must take the lead towards the establishment of a new universal standard. Yet being Hindus we must seek it through that which is particular to ourselves. We have one standard that is at once universal and particular, the eternal religion, which is the basis, permanent and always inherent in India, of the shift- ing, mutable and multiform thing we call Hinduism. Sticking fast where you are like a limpet is not the dharma, neither is leaping without looking the dharma.

Whatever is consis- tent with the truth and principle of things, whatever increases love among men, whatever makes for the strength of the individ- ual, the nation and the race, is divine, it is the law of Vaivaswata Manu, it is the sanatana dharma and the Hindu shastra. Only, God is the triple harmony, He is not one-sided. Our love must not make us weak, blind or unwise; our strength must not make us hard and furious; our principles must not make us fanatical or sentimental. Let us think calmly, patiently, impartially; let us love wholly and intensely but wisely; let us act with strength, nobility and force. If even then we make mistakes, yet God makes none. We decide and act; He determines the fruit, and whatever He determines is good. He is already determining it. Men have long been troubling themselves about social reform and blameless orthodoxy, and orthodoxy has crumbled without social reform being effected. But all the time God has been going about India getting His work done in spite of the talking. Unknown to men the social revolution prepares itself, and it is not in the direction they think, for it embraces the world, not India only. Whether we like it or not, He will sweep out the refuse of the Indian past and the European present. But the broom is not always sufÆcient; sometimes He uses the sword in preference. It seems probable that it will be used, for the world does not mend itself quickly, and therefore it will have violently to be mended. But this is a general principle; how shall we determine the principles that are particular to the nature of the community and the nature of the Age? There is such a thing as yugadharma, the right institutions & modes of action for the age in which we live. For action depends indeed on the force of knowledge or will that is to be used, but it depends, too, on the time, the place & the vessel. Institutions that are right in one age are not right in another.

When in His cosmic circling movement He establishes some stable worldwide harmony, that is man's Satya Yuga. When harmony falters, is maintained with difÆculty, not in the nature of men, but by an accepted force or political instru- ment, that is his Treta. When the faltering becomes stumbling and the harmony has to be maintained at every step by a care- ful & laborious regulation, that is his Dwapara. When there is disintegration, & all descends in collapse and ruin, nothing can stay farther the cataclysm that is his Kali. This is the natural law of progress of all human ideas & institutions. It applies always in the mass, continually though less perfectly in the detail. One may almost say that each human religion, society, civilisation has its four Ages. For this movement is not only the most natural, but the most salutary. It is not a justiÆcation of pessimism nor a gospel of dumb fate & sorrowful annihilation. It is not, as we too often think in our attachment to the form, a melancholy law of decline & the vanity of all human achievements. If each Satya has its Kali, equally does each Kali prepare its Satya. That destruction was necessary for this creation, and the new har- mony, when it is perfected, will be better than the old. But there is the weakness, there is the half success turning to failure, there is the discouragement, there is the loss of energy & faith which clouds our periods of disintegration, the apparent war, violence, ragging, tumult & trample to and fro which attends our periods of gradual creation and half-perfection. Therefore men cry out dismally & lament that all is perishing. But if they trusted in God's Love & Wisdom, not preferring to it their conservative & narrow notions, they would rather cry out that all is being reborn. So much depends on Time & God's immediate purpose that it is more important to seek out His purpose than to attach ourselves to our own nostrums. The Kala Purusha, Zeitgeist & Death Spirit, has risen to his dreadful work – lokakshayakrit- pravriddhas – increasing to destroy a world, – and who shall stay the terror & mightiness & irresistibility of Him?

The Pandits are therefore right when they make a difference between the practice of the Satya & the practice of the Kali. But in their application of this knowledge, they do not seem to me to be always wise or learned. They forget or do not know that Kali is the age for a destruction & rebirth, not for a desperate clinging to the old that can no longer be saved. They entrench themselves in the system of Kalivarjya, but forget that it is not the weaknesses but the strengths of the old harmony that are being subjected to varjanam, abandonment. That which is saved is merely a temporary platform which we have erected on the banks of the sea of change awaiting a more stable habitation; and it too must one day break down under the crash of the waves, must disappear into the engulÆng waters.

India alone can build the future of mankind; in India alone can the effective Avatar appear to the nations. And until He appears, it is for India to gather herself up out of her dust & degradation, – symbol of the shattered Satyayuga – commune with her soul by Yoga and to know her past & her future. I have not here speculated on what we should build, what we should break, nor shall I now deÆne my detailed opinions – but whatever it be, we must do it in the light and in the spirit of that triple principle of the divine nature; we must act in the reØection of God's Love, Strength & Wisdom. We are Hindus seeking to re-Hinduise society, not to Euro- peanise it. But what is Hinduism? Or what is its social principle?"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"58 Essays Divine and Human One thing at least is certain about Hinduism religious or social, that its whole outlook is Godward, its whole search and business is the discovery of God and our fulÆlment in God. But God is ev- erywhere and universal. Where did Hinduism seek Him? Ancient or preBuddhistic Hinduism sought him both in the world and outside it; it took its stand on the strength & beauty & joy of the Veda, unlike modern or postBuddhistic Hinduism which is op- pressed with Buddha's sense of universal sorrow and Shankara's sense of universal illusion, – Shankara who was the better able to destroy Buddhism because he was himself half a Buddhist. Ancient Hinduism aimed socially at our fulÆlment in God in life, modern Hinduism at the escape from life to God. The more mod- ern ideal is fruitful of a noble and ascetic spirituality, but has a chilling and hostile effect on social soundness and development, social life under its shadow stagnates for want of belief and de- light, sraddha and ananda. If we are to make our society perfect and the nation is to live again, then we must revert to the earlier and fuller truth. We must not make life a waiting for renuncia- tion, but renunciation a preparation for life; instead of running from God in the town to God in the forest, we must rather plunge into the mountain solitude in our own souls for knowledge & joy & spiritual energy to sustain any part that may be given to us by the master of the Lila. If we get that strength, any society we build up must be full of the instinct of immortal life and move inevitably towards perfection. As to the precise way in which society will be reconstructed, we have hardly yet knowledge enough to solve the problem. We ought to know before we act, but we are rather eager to act violently in the light of any dim ray of knowledge that may surprise our unreØecting intellects, and although God often uses our haste for great and beneÆcial purposes, yet that way of doing things is not the best either for a man or a nation. One thing seems to me clear that the future will deny that principle of individual selÆshness and collective self- interest on which European society has hitherto been based and our renovated systems will be based on the renunciation of indi- vidual selÆshness and the organisation of brotherhood, – prin- ciples common to Christianity, Mahomedanism and Hinduism."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Mission of India [.....] [That] which is permanent in the Hindu religion, must form the basis on which the world will increasingly take its stand in dealing with spiritual experience and religious truth.

It is now developing out of existence; its mission is done, its capacities exhausted, the Truth which, like other religions, it defended, honoured, preserved, cherished, misused and disÆgured, is about to take to itself new forms and dispense with all other screens or defender than its own immortal beauty, grandeur, truth and effectiveness.

Their position and temperament is so lofty and noble and their solvent force on the gross impurities of a materialised humanity has been so invaluable that it is with some reluctance one Ænds oneself obliged to put them on one side and pass onward. But it seems to me that we must pass onward if we would know and possess God in His entirety and not merely in a side or aspect. There is a story in the Jewish Scriptures which relates that when God wished to show himself to Moses, he could only, owing to the spiritual imperfections of the Jewish prophet, reveal safely to him His hinder parts. Moses would have died if he had seen the front of God; he had not the dharanam, the soul-power to support that tremendous vision. The story well illuminates the character of materialism generally and to its aggressive modern form, European thought & civilisation, it applies with a quite overwhelming apposite- ness. But it seems to me that the average Vedantist, too, has only seen, for his part, the crown of the Lord's head and the average bhakta only the Kaustubh-stone over His heart or the Srivatsa mark upon it. On the other hand, there are those rationalists who are by no means ascetical in their views or temperament and their name is legion; they insist on our putting religion and God aside or keeping Him only for ornamental uses in spare moments, leave that, they say, & devote yourselves to practical work for mankind. That rationalism is necessary too if only to balance the error of the ascetics who would make of God's world a mistake and of its Maker an Almighty blunderer or an inscrutable eccentric or an indeÆnable Something inhabiting a chaos or a mirage.

From one point of view I cannot Ænd praise warm enough to do justice to the work of Theosophy; from another I cannot Ænd condemnation strong enough to denounce it. It has forced on the notice of an unwilling world truths to which orthodoxy is blind and of which heterodoxy is afraid or incredulous. It has shown a colossal courage in facing ridicule, trampling on prejudice and slander, persisting in faith in spite of disillusionment, scandal and a continual shifting of knowledge. They have kept the Øag of a past & future science Øying against enormous difÆculties. On the other hand by bringing to the investigation of that science – not its discovery, for to the Hindu Yogin it is known already – the traditional European methods, the methods of the market-place and the forum, it has brought on the truths themselves much doubt and discredit, and by im- porting into them the forms, jugglery and jargon of European mystics, their romanticism, their unbridled imagination, their galloping impatience, their haste, bragging and loudness, their susceptibility to dupery, trickery, obstinate error and greedy self- deception, Theosophists have strengthened doubt and discredit and driven many an earnest seeker to bewilderment, to angry suspicion or to Ænal renunciation of the search for truth. They have scattered the path of the conscientious investigators, the severe scientists of Yoga who must appear in the future, with the thorns and sharp Øints of a well-justiÆed incredulity and suspicion. I admit the truths that Theosophy seeks to unveil; but I do not think they can be reached if we fall into bondage even to the most inspiring table talk of Mahatmas or to the confused anathemas and vaticinations hurled from their platform tripods by modern Pythonesses of the type of M r . s .

But in order that the victory may not be slow & stumbling in its progress and imperfect in its fulÆlment, it is necessary that whatever India has to offer should be stated to the West in language that the West can understand and through a principle of knowledge which it has made its own. Europe will accept nothing which is not scientiÆc, nothing, that is to say which does not take up its stand on an assured, well-ordered and veri- Æable knowledge. Undoubtedly, for practical purposes the West is right; since only by establishing ourselves on such an assured foundation can we work with the utmost effectiveness and make the most of what we know. For shastra is the true basis of all perfect action & shastra means the full and careful teaching of the principles, relations and processes of every branch of knowledge, action or conduct with which the mind concerns itself. Indian knowledge possesses such a scientiÆc basis, but, in these greater matters, unexpressed or expressed only in broad principles, compact aphorisms, implied logical connections not minutely treated in detail, fully, with a patient logical order & development in the way to which the occidental intellect is now accustomed and which it has become its second nature to demand. The aphoristic method has great advantages. It pre- vents the mind from getting encrusted in details and fossilising there; it leaves a wide room & great latitude for originality & the delicate play of individuality in the details. It allows a science to remain elastic and full of ever new potentialities for the discoverer. No doubt, it has disadvantages. It leaves much room for inaccuracy, for individual error, for the violences of the ill-trained & the freaks of the inefÆcient.

The phenomenon of the Theosophical Society is a warning to us of a pressing urgency. It will never do to allow the science of Indian knowledge to be represented to the West through this strange & distorting medium. For this society of European & European-led inquirers arose from an impulse on which the Time-Spirit itself insists; their object, vaguely grasped at by them, was at bottom the systematic coordination, explanation & practice of Oriental re- ligion & Oriental mental & spiritual discipline. Unfortunately, as always happens to a great effort in unÆt hands, it stumbled at the outset & went into strange bypaths. It fell into the mediaeval snare of Gnostic mysticism, Masonic secrecy & Rosicrucian jar- gon. The little science it attempted has been rightly stigmatised as pseudo-science. A vain attempt to thrust in modern physical science into the explanation of psychical movements, – to ex- plain for instance pranayam in the terms of oxygen & hydrogen! – to accept uncritically every experience & every random idea about an experience as it occurred to the mind & set it up as a revealed truth & almost a semi-divine communication, to make a hopeless amalgam & jumble of science, religion & philosophy all expressed in the terms of the imagination – this has been the scientiÆc method of Theosophy. The result is that it lays its hands on truth & muddles it so badly that it comes out to the world as an untruth.

Even the sneer on the lips of the derider of occultism has to pass through a number of ill-understood processes before it can man- ifest itself on his face, yet the thing itself is the work of a second. That sneer is a much greater and more occult miracle than the precipitation of letters or the reading of the Akashic records.

Has the claim been substantiated? Has the superiority been proved? What Indians see is a body which is professedly and hos- pitably open to all enquiry at the base but entrenches itself in a Papal or mystic infallibility at the top. To be admitted into the society it is enough to believe in the freest investigation and the brotherhood of mankind, but everyone who is admit- ted must feel, if he is honest with himself, that he is joining a body which stands for certain well-known dogmas, a deÆnite and very elaborate cosmogony and philosophy and a peculiar organisation, the spirit, if not the open practice in which seems to be theocratic rather than liberal. One feels that the liberality of the outer rings is only a wisely politic device for attracting a wider circle of sympathisers from whom numerous converts to the inner can be recruited. It is the dogmas, the cosmogony, the philosophy, the theocratic organisation which the world under- stands by Theosophy and which one strengthens by adhesion to the society; free inquiry and the brotherhood of man beneÆt to a very slight degree.

But if the smaller hierophants are sometimes and rarely Indians, the theocrats and the bulk of the prophets are Russian, American or English. An Indian here and there may quicken the illumination of the Theosophist, but it is Madame Blavatsky or Mrs Besant, Sinnett or Leadbeater who lays down the commandments and the Law. It is strange to see the present political condition of India reproducing itself in a spiritual organisation; it illustrates perhaps the subtle intercon- nection and interdependence of all individual and communal activities in the human being. But the political subordination Ænds its justiÆcation in the physical fact of the British rule. It is argued plausibly, and perhaps correctly, that without this sub- ordination British supremacy could have no sure foundation. But where is the justiÆcation for the foreign spiritual control?

Still, I say, that all this does not constitute Theosophy into Brahmavidya, but leaves it what it was, Devavidya. It is still not the knowledge of the One, not the knowledge that leads to salvation, but the knowledge of the Many, – of our bondage & not of our freedom, Avidya & not Vidya. I do not decry it for that reason, but it is necessary that it should be put in its right place and not blot out for us the diviner knowledge of our forefathers. Theosophy is or should be a wider & profounder Science, a knowledge that deals with other levels & movements of consciousness, planes if you like so to call them, phenomena depending on the activity of consciousness on those levels, worlds & beings formed by the activity of consciousness on those levels, – for what is a world but the synthesis in Space & Time of a particular level of consciousness, – forming a Æeld of consciousness with which material Science, the Science of this immediately visible world, cannot yet deal, and for the most part, not believing in it as fact, refuses to deal. Theosophy is, therefore, properly speaking, a high scientiÆc enquiry.

As Christ himself foresaw, it has never been understood even by its professors. For Æve hundred years it was a glorious mirage for which thousands of men and women willingly underwent imprisonment, torture and death in order that Christ's kingdom might come on earth & felicity possess the nations.

I am speaking of the fundamental truth, the truth of things and not merely the fact about particulars or of particulars only as their knowledge forms a basis or a help to the discovery of fundamental truth. The fact that a particular sort of con- tact makes me uncomfortable is nothing in itself except in so far as it throws light upon the general causes of pain; the na- ture, origin and purpose of pain is the fundamental truth that I seek about the sensational reaction to contact. This law of pain, moreover, is not so fundamental as the truth about the nature, origin and purpose of sensation and contact themselves, of which pain is a particularity, an example or a modiÆcation. This more fundamental truth becomes again itself particular when compared with the truth about the nature, origin and purpose of existence of which sensation and contact are only particular circumstances.

Of this attempt the Gita is the standing monument and the most perfect example. To see the confusion working in its untrammelled force, – and it is only so, by isolating the disease from the modiÆcation of curative forces, that we can observe, diagnose and afterwards Ænd its remedy – we must go to the intellectual history of the European continent. There have been, properly speaking, two critical periods in this history, the Graeco-Roman era of philosophic illumination previous to Christianity and the era of modern scientiÆc illumination which is still unexhausted. In the Ærst we see the revolt of Philosophy (with Science concealed in her protective embrace) against the usurpation of religion. We Ænd it, after achieving liberation, in its turn denying religion and usurping her sacred prerogative. In the modern era we see Science this time emerged and adult, keeping Philosophy behind her, in revolt against religion, Ærst liberate herself, then deny religion & usurp her prerogatives, then, or as part of this Ænal process of conquest, turn, deny & strike down her lofty ally and usurp also her ancient territory. For if Science has scorned & denied religion, she has equally scorned & denied Metaphysics. If she has declared God to be a barbarous myth, a Æction of dreams and terrors and longings and denied us the right of communion with the inÆnite, equally has she declared metaphysics to be an aberration of the ideative faculty, a false extension of logic and denied our right to recognise any metaphysical existence or anything at all which cannot be judged by or inferred from the results of the test tube, the scalpel, the microscope & the telescope. Neither, however, has she herself hesitated to dogmatise about the essential nature of existence and the mutual relations of its general modes, matter, life, mind and spirit.

The old philosophical spirit was torn to pieces with Hypatia in the bloodstained streets of Alexandria. Theology usurped her place and discoursed blindly & foolishly on transubstantiation and consubstantiality and one knows not what other barren mysteries. So far as philosophy was allowed an independent existence, she was compelled to do not her own work but the work of science; so we Ænd the schoolmen elaborately determining by logic and a priori word fencing questions which could only be properly determined by observation and analysis. For Theology, for Mediaeval Religion herself did not care for this Æeld of knowledge; she had no need for scientiÆc truths just as the Jacobin Republic had ™no need of chemists∫; in fact she guillotined Science wherever its presence attracted her attention. But all injustice – and that means at bottom all denial of truth, of the satyam and ritam – brings about its own punishment or, as Religion would put it, God's visitation & vengeance. Science liberated, given in her strenuous emergence the strength of the Titans, avenges herself today on her old oppressors, on Religion, on Philosophy, breaks their temples, scorns their gods & prophets & seeks to deprive them even of the right to existence.

Let ours be the path of perfection, not of abandonment; let our aim be victory in the battle, not the escape from all conØict. Buddha and Shankara supposed the world to be radically false and miserable; therefore escape from the world was to them the only wisdom.

The world is His play with His own self-conscious delight, He who alone exists, inÆnite, free and perfect; we are the self-multiplications of that conscious delight, thrown out into being to be His playmates. The world is a formula, a rhythm, a symbol-system expressing God to Himself in His own consciousness, – it has no material existence but exists only in His consciousness and self-expression; we, like God, are in our inward being That which is expressed, but in our outward being terms of that formula, notes of that rhythm, symbols of that system.

All other utilisation of Yoga is for special and fragmentary ad- vantages not always worth pursuing. Only that which aims at possessing the fullness of God is purna Yoga; the sadhaka of the Divine Perfection is the purna Yogin. Our aim must be to be perfect as God in His being and bliss is perfect, pure as He is pure, blissful as He is blissful, and, when we are ourselves siddha in the purna Yoga, to bring all mankind to the same divine perfection. It does not matter if for the present we fall short of our aim, so long as we give ourselves whole-heartedly to the attempt and by living constantly in it and for it move forward even two inches upon the road; even that will help to lead humanity out of the struggle and twilight in which it now dwells into the luminous joy which God intends for us.

You can know the InÆnite in a way, but you cannot know the Absolute.

You can be- come Parabrahman; you cannot know Parabrahman. Becoming Parabrahman means going back through self-consciousness into Parabrahman, for you already are That, only you have projected yourself forward in self-consciousness into its terms or symbols, Purusha & Prakriti through which you uphold the universe. Therefore, to become Parabrahman void of terms or symbols you must cease out of the universe. By becoming Parabrahman void of Its self-symbols you do not become anything you are not already, nor does the universe cease to operate. It only means that God throws back out of the ocean of manifest consciousness one stream or movement of Himself into that from which all consciousness proceeded. All who go out of universe-consciousness, do not necessar- ily go into Parabrahman.

Therefore to lust after becoming Parabrahman is a sort of luminous illusion or sattwic play of Maya; for in reality there is none bound & none free & none needing to be freed and all is only God's Lila, Parabrahman's play of manifestation. God uses this sattwic Maya in certain egos in order to draw them upwards in the line of His special purpose & for these egos it is the only right and possible path. But the aim of our Yoga is Jivanmukti in the universe; not because we need to be freed or for any other reason, but because that is God's will in us, we have to live released in the world, not released out of the world. The Jivanmukta has, for perfect knowledge & self-fulÆlment to stand on the threshold of Parabrahman, but not to cross the threshold. The statement he brings back from the threshold is that That is & we are That, but what That is or is not, words cannot describe, nor mind discriminate.

A philosophi- cal or religious system is only a statement of that arrangement of existence in universe which God has revealed to us as our status of being. It is given in order that the mind may have something to stand upon while we act in Prakriti. But our vision need not be precisely the same in arrangement as the vision of others, nor is the form of thought that suits our mentality bound to suit a mentality differently constituted.

Yogo hi prabhavapyayau. For Yoga is the beginning & ending of things. In the Puranas the meaning of the phrase is underlined & developed. By Yoga God made the world, by Yoga He will draw it into Himself in the end. But not only the original creation & Ænal dissolution of the universe, all great changes of things, creations, evolutions, destructions are effected by the essential process of Yoga, tapasya. In this ancient view Yoga presents itself as the effective, perhaps the essential & real executive movement of Nature herself in all her processes. If this is so in the general workings of Nature, if that is to say, a divine Knowledge and a divine Will in things by putting itself into relation with objects is the true cause of all force & effectuality, the same rule should hold good in human activities. It should hold good especially of all conscious & willed processes of psychological discipline, – Yogic systems, as we call them; Yoga can really be nothing but a consummate & self-conscious natural process intended to effect rapidly objects which the ordinary natural movement works out slowly, in the tardy pace of a secular or even millennial evolution. There is an apparent difference. The aim put before us in Yoga is God; the aim of Nature is to effect supernature; but these two aims are of one piece & intention. God & superna- ture are only one the real & the other the formal aspect of the one unattainable fulÆlment towards which our human march is in its ascent directed.

In other words, everything that exists, separately, is a particular symbol and the whole sum of existence is a general symbol which tries to translate the untranslatable existence, God, into the terms of world-consciousness. It is intended to try, it is not intended to succeed; for the moment it succeeds, it ceases to be itself and becomes that untranslatable something from which it started, God. No symbol is intended to express God perfectly, not even the highest; but it is the privilege of the highest symbols to lose in Him their separate deÆniteness, cease to be symbols and become in consciousness that which is symbolised. Humanity is such a symbol or eidolon of God; we are made, to use the Biblical phrase, in His image; and by that is meant not a formal image, but the image of His being and personality; we are of the essence of His divinity and of the quality of His divinity; we are formed in the mould and bear the stamp of a divine being and a divine knowledge. In everything that exists phenomenally, or, as I shall pre- fer to say, going deeper into the nature of things, symbolically, there are two parts of being, thing in itself and symbol, Self and Nature, res (thing that is) and factum (thing that is done or made), immutable being and mutable becoming, that which is supernatural to it and that which is natural. Every state of existence has some force in it which drives it to transcend it- self. Matter moves towards becoming life, Life travails towards becoming Mind, Mind aspires towards becoming ideal Truth, Truth rises towards becoming divine and inÆnite Spirit. The reason is that every symbol, being a partial expression of God, reaches out to and seeks to become its own entire reality; it aspires to become its real self by transcending its apparent self. Thing that is made, is attracted towards thing that is, becoming towards being, the natural towards the supernatural, symbol towards thing-in-itself, Nature towards God.

For there are three conditions for all changeable existences, the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"110 Essays Divine and Human upward ascension, the arrested status and the downward lapse. Nature in its lower states moves upward indeed in the mass, but seeks the Ænal salvation for only a limited number of its individ- uals. It is not every form of matter that organises life although every form of matter teems with the spirit of life and is full of its urgent demand for release & self-manifestation. Not every form of life organises mind, although in all forms of life mind is there, insistent, seeking for its escape and self-expression. Nor is every mental being Ætted to organise the life of ideal truth, although in every mental being, in dog & ape & worm no less than in man, the imprisoned spirit of truth & knowledge seeks for its escape and self-expression. Nature in each realised state of her building seeks Ærst to assure the natural existence of her creatures in that state; only after this primary aim is accomplished does she seek through the best Ætted of them to escape from her works, to break down what she has built and arrive at something beyond. It is not till she reaches man that she arrives at a type of being of which every individual is essentially capable of realising not only the natural but the supernatural within it; and even this is true with modiÆcations, with qualiÆcations. But of this it will be better to speak at greater length in another connection. Nevertheless, it remains true that the upward movement is the master movement of Nature; arrested status is a lower fulÆl- ment, & if perfect, a transient perfection. It is a perfection in the realms of struggle and in the style of passing forms, a fulÆlment in the kingdoms of Ashanaya Mrityu, Hunger who is death, Hunger that creates & feeds upon its creations; the upward movement is that which leads up through death to immortality & realises in this earth of the body the blissful and luminous kingdom of heaven; the downward lapse is destruction, Hell, a great perdition, mahati vinashtih. These are the three gatis or Æ- nal states of becoming indicated in the Gita, uttama, madhyama & adhama, highest, middle and lowest, offered to the choice of humanity.

Life is supernatural to Matter, Mind super- natural to Life, Ideal Being supernatural to Mind, the InÆnite Spirit supernatural to ideal being. We must, therefore, accept the supernatural as our goal; for the tendency of our nature to the super-nature just above it is a command of the World Power to be obeyed and not rebelled against & distrusted. It is here that Faith has its importance & Religion, when uncorrupted, its incalculable utility; for our natural mind seeks to dwell in its nature & is sceptical of supernature. Faith & religion were provisions of the All Wise Energy to accustom the natural & merely mental man to the promptings of the ideal soul in him which seeks even now to escape out of twilight into light, out of groping into truth, out of the senses & reasoning into vision & direct experience. The upward tendency is imposed on us & we cannot permanently resist it; at some time or another God will lay his hands on us and force us up that steep incline so difÆcult to our unregenerate treading. For as surely as the animal develops towards humanity & in its most Øexible types attains a kind of humanity, as surely as the ape and the ant having once appeared, man was bound to follow, so surely man develops towards godhead & in his more capable types approaches nearer & nearer towards godhead, attains a kind of deity, & so surely the genius & the saint having appeared man is bound to develop in himself & out of himself the superman, the siddha purusha. For this conclusion no prophetic power or revelation is needed; it is the inevitable corollary from the previous demonstrations worked out for us in the vast laboratory of Nature. We have to transcend Nature, to become super-Nature, but it follows from what I have said that it is by taking advantage of something still imprisoned in Nature itself, by following some line which Nature is trying to open to us that we ought to proceed.

It is a particular becoming & is Æxed in the nature of the symbol that it has become; only the touch of that which is all becomings and exceeds all becomings, can liberate it from the bondage to its own limited Nature. God is That which is the All and which exceeds the All. It is therefore only the knowledge, love and possession of God that can make us free.

The prophets have spoken & the Avatars have descended always for the one purpose, to call us to God, to inspire us to this great call on our upward straining energies or else to prepare something in the world which will help to bring humanity nearer to the goal of its difÆcult ascending journey. It may seem at Ærst sight that there is no need for these religious terms or this religious spirit. If the aim is to become something superior to man, to evolve a superman out of our- selves, as man has been evolved out of the ape, – if that state- ment of the progression be indeed the truth, – the ape out of inferior animal forms, they again out of mollusc & protoplasm, jellyÆsh or vegetable animals, & so to the end of the series, then what need is there of anything but the training, preferably the most intelligent & scientiÆc training of our mental, moral and physical energies till they reach a point when they are transmuted by the psychical chemistry of Nature into the coming superior type? But the problem is not so simple, in reality. There are three errors hidden at the basis of this sceptical question. We mistake the nature of the operation to be effected, we mistake the nature of the power & process that works it out, we mistake the nature of the thing that uses the power & works out the process. Nature does not propose to man to work out a higher mental, moral and physical variation-type in the mould of the present human being, – the symbol we are; it proposes to break that general type altogether in order to advance to a new symbol- being which shall be supernatural to present man as present man is to the animal below him. It is doubtful whether in the pure human mould Nature can go much farther than she has gone at present; that she can for instance produce a higher mental type than Newton, Shakespeare, Caesar or Napoleon, a higher moral type than Buddha, Christ or St Francis, a higher physical type than the Greek athlete or to give modern examples, a Sandow or a Ramamurti. She may seek to bring about a better combination of mental & moral, or of moral, mental & physical energies; but is she likely to produce anything much above the level of Confucius or Socrates? It is more probable & seems to be true that Nature seeks in this Æeld to generalise a higher level and"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Fullness of Yoga — In Condition 117 a better combination. Neither need we believe that, even here, her object is to bring all men to the same level; for that can only be done by levelling downwards. Nothing in Nature is free from inequalities except the forms that are the lowest and least developed. The higher the effort accomplished, the more richly endowed the organism of the species, the greater the chances of inequality. In so high and developed a natural movement as Man, equality of individual opportunity is conceivable, equality of natural powers and accomplishment is a chimera. Nor will the generalisation of powers or the increase of material make any difference to the level of natural attainment. All the accumulated discoveries & varied information of the modern scientist will not make him mentally the superior of Aristotle or Socrates; he is neither an acuter mind nor a greater mental force. All the varied activities of modern philanthropy will not produce a greater moral type than Buddha or St Francis. The invention of the motor car will not make up for the lost swiftness & endurance nor gymnastics restore the physical capacity of the Negro or the American Indian. We see therefore the limits of Nature's possibilities in the human symbol, Æxed by the character of the symbol itself and recognised by her in her strivings. It is still a question whether in these limits the chief preoc- cupation of Nature is the exhaustion of the possibilities of the human symbol. That is rather man's preoccupation and there- fore the direction she takes when human intellect interferes with her normal progression. Left to herself & even utilising human interferences, she seems bent rather on breaking the mould, than on perfecting it, – only indeed in her more advanced individuals & more daring movements and with due regard to the safety of the general human type, but this is always her method when she wishes to advance to a fresh symbol without destroying the anterior species. The more civilised man becomes, the more she plagues him with moral abnormalities, excesses of vice & virtue and confusions of the very type of vice & virtue; the more he intellectualises, the more he insists on rationality as his utmost bourne, the more she becomes dissatisÆed and clamours to him to develop rather his instincts & his intuitions; the more he"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"118 Essays Divine and Human strives after health & hygiene, the more she multiplies diseases & insanities of mind and body. He has triumphed over super- naturalism, he has chained her down to the material, human & rational; immediately she breaks out Æercely into unthought-of revivals and gigantic supernaturalisms. Whatever work she is intent on, she will not be baulked in that work by the limited human reason. Through all her vast being she feels the pulsation of a supernatural power, the workings & strivings of a knowl- edge superior to material reason. She breaks out, therefore, she compels, she insists. Everywhere we see her striving to break the mental, moral & physical type she has created & to get beyond it to some new processes as yet not clearly discerned. She attacks deliberately the sound healthfulness & equilibrium of our normal type of intellectuality, morality & physical being. She is stricken also with a mania of colossalism; colossal struc- tures, colossal combinations, colossal heights & speeds, colossal dreams & ambitions outline themselves everywhere more or less clearly, more or less dimly. Unable as yet to do her will in the individual, she works with masses; unable in the mind, with material forms & inventions; unable in actualities, with hopes & dreams; unable to reproduce or produce Napoleons & super- Napoleons, she generalises a greater reach of human capacity from which they may hereafter emerge more easily, & mean- while she creates instead Dreadnoughts & Super-dreadnoughts, Trusts & mammoth combines, teems with distance destroying inventions & seems eager & furious to trample to pieces the limitations of space & time she herself has created. As if to point her Ænger to the thing she intends, she has accu- mulated the signs of this process of breaking & rebuilding in the phenomena of genius. It is now common knowledge that genius hardly appears in the human species unattended, unprepared or unaccompanied by abnormalities in the individual body, vitality & mind which contains it, – degeneration, insanity or freak in the heredity which produces it and even disturbance & supra- normality in the human environment in which it occurs. The haste of a brilliant generalisation establishes on this basis the paradox that genius itself is a morbid phenomenon of insanity or"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Fullness of Yoga — In Condition 119 degeneration. The true explanation is sufÆciently clear. In order to establish genius in the human system, Nature is compelled to disturb & partially break the normality of that system, because she is introducing into it an element that is alien as it is superior to the type which it enriches. Genius is not the perfect evolution of that new & divine element; it is only a beginning or at the highest an approximation in certain directions. It works Ætfully & uncertainly in the midst of an enormous mass of somewhat disordered human mentality, vital nervosity, physical animality. The thing itself is divine, it is only the undivine mould in which it works that is to a lesser or greater extent broken & ploughed up by the unassimilated force that works in it. Sometimes there is an element in the divine intruder which lays its hand on the mould & sustains it, so that it does not break at all, nor is Øawed; or if there is a disturbance, it is slight and negligible. Such an element there was in Caesar, in Shakespeare, in Goethe. Sometimes also a force appears to which we can no longer apply the description of genius without being hopelessly inadequate in our terminology. Then those who have eyes to see, bow down and confess the Avatar. For it is often the work of the Avatar to typify already, partly or on the whole, what Nature has not yet effected in the mass or even in the individual, so that his passing may stamp it on the material ether in which we live. But what is this type of which the great Mother is in labour? What birth will emerge from the cries & throes of this prolonged & mighty pregnancy? A greater type of humanity, it may be said. But in order to understand what we are saying, we must Ærst see clearly what the humanity is which she seeks to surpass. This human symbol, this type we now are is a mental being with a mental ego, working in a vital case by mind always, but upon matter, in matter & through matter. It is limited in its higher workings by its lower instruments. Its basis of mind is egois- tic, sensational & determined by experience & environment, its knowledge therefore pursues wider or narrower circles in a Æxed and meagre range. Its moral temperament & action is similarly egoistic, sensational, experiential and determined by environment; for this reason it is bound equally to sin & virtue"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"120 Essays Divine and Human and all attempts radically to moralise the race within the limits of its egoistic nature have been & must necessarily, in spite of particular modiÆcations, end in general failure. It is not only a mixed but a confused type, body & vitality interfering with mind & mind both hampered by & hampering body & vitality. Its search for knowledge, founded on sense contact, is a groping like that of a man Ænding his way in a forest at night; it makes acquaintance with its surroundings by touching, dashing on or stumbling over them; and, although it has an uncertain light of reason given it which partially corrects this disability, yet since reason has also to start from the senses which are consistent falsiÆers of values, rational knowledge is not only restricted but pursued by vast dimnesses & uncertainties even in that which it seems to itself to have grasped. It secures a few Øowers of truth by rummaging in a thorny hedge of doubts & errors. The actions of the type also are a breaking through thickets, a san- guine yet tormented stumbling forward through eager failures to partial and temporary successes. Immensely superior to all else that Nature had yet effected, this type is yet so burdened with disabilities, that, if it were impossible to break its mould and go forward, there would be much justiÆcation for those pessimistic philosophies which despair of Life & see in the Will not to Live humanity's only door of escape admitting to it no other salvation. But Nature is the will of the all-Wise God and she is not working out a reduction of the world to absurdity. She knows her goal, she knows that man as he is at present is only a transitional type; and so far as she can consistently with the survival of the type, she presses forward to what she has seen in God's eternal knowledge as standing beyond.

In brief, as she has aspired successfully from matter to life, from life to mind & mental ego, so she aspires & with a fated success to an element beyond mind, the vijnana of the Hindus, the self- luminous idea or Truth-self now concealed & superconscious in man and the world, as life was always concealed in matter and mind in life. What this vijnana is, we have yet to see, but through it she knows she can lay Ærm hold on that highest term of all which is the reality of all symbols, in Spirit, in Sachchidananda. The aim of Nature is also the aim of Yoga. Yoga, like Nature at its summit, seeks to break this mould of ego, this mould of mentalised life body and materialised mind, in order to achieve ideal action, ideal truth and inÆnite freedom in our spiritual be- ing. To effect so enormous an end great and dangerous processes have to be used. Those who have been eager on this road or have opened up new paths towards the goal, have had to affront as a possibility frequently realised loss of reason, loss of life & health or dissolution of the moral being. They are not to be pitied or scorned even when they succumb; rather are they martyrs for humanity's progress, far more than the lost navigator or the scientist slain by the dangers of his investigation. They prepare consciently the highest possible achievement towards which the rest of humanity instinctively & unconsciously moves. We may even say that Yoga is the appointed means Nature holds in reserve for the accomplishment of her end, when she has Æn- ished her long labour of evolving at least a part of humanity temperamentally equal to the effort and intellectually, morally & physically prepared for success.

The material agents involved & phenomenon produced are different & therefore we do not call the recoil of one horned forehead from another an act of knowledge or intelligence, but the thing that has happened is intrinsically the same. Intelligence is itself inert & mechanical & merely the physiological result of a phys- iological movement & has nothing in it psychical or mental in the time-honoured sense of the words soul and mind. This is the view of modern scientiÆc rationalism, – put indeed in other language than the scientist's, put so as to bring out its logical consequences & implications, but still effectively the modern account of the universe. In that account the nature of a thing consists of its composi- tion, the properties contained in that composition and the laws of working determined by those properties; as for [example] iron is composed of certain elementary substances, possesses as a consequence of its composition certain properties, such as hardness etc. and under given circumstances will act in a given manner as the result of its properties. Applying this analysis on a larger scale we see the universe as the composition of certain brute forces working in certain material substances, possessed in itself and in those substances of certain primary & secondary, general & particular properties and working as a result by cer- tain invariable tendencies & Æxed processes which we call by a human Ægure Nature's Laws. This is Nature. When searchingly analysed she is found to be a play of two entities, Force & Matter; but these two, if the unitarian view of the universe is correct, will some day be proved to be only one entity, either only Matter or only Force.

In what after all does intelligence consist, what are its composition, properties, laws? What in its circumstances is human intelligence, the only kind of intelligence which we are in a position to study from within & therefore understand? It is marked by three qualities or processes, the power & process of adaptation towards an end, the power & process of discrimina- tion between the impacts on its senses & the power & process of mentally conscious comprehension. Human intelligence is, to put it brieØy, teleological, discriminative and mentally conscious. About other than human beings, about animals, trees, metals, forces, we can say nothing from inside, we can only infer the absence or presence of these elements of consciousness from the evidence collected by an external observation. We cannot positively say, having no internal evidence, that the tree is not a mind imprisoned in matter and unable to express itself in the media it has at its disposal; we cannot say that it does not suffer the reactions of pleasure and pain; but from the external evidence we infer to the contrary. Our negative conclusion is probable, it is not certain. It may be itself negatived in the future march of knowledge. But still, taking the evidence as it stands, what are the facts we actually arrive at in this comparison of intelligent & non-intelligent Nature? First, Nature possesses in a far higher degree than man the teleological faculty & process. To place an aim before one, to combine, adapt, modify, unify, vary means & processes in order to attain that end, to struggle against and overcome difÆculties, to devise means to circumvent difÆculties when they cannot be overcome, this is one of the noblest & divinest parts of human intelligence. But its action in man is only a speciality of its uni- versal action in Nature. She works it out in man partly through the reason, in animals with very little & rudimentary reason, mainly through instinct, memory, impulse & sensation, in plants & other objects with very little & rudimentary reason, mainly through impulse & mechanical or, as we call it, involuntary ac- tion. But throughout there is the end & the adaptation to the end, & throughout the same basic means are used; for in man also it is only for a selection of his ends & processes that the reason"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Nature 125 is used; for the greater part she uses the animal means, memory, impulse, sensation, instinct, – instincts differently directed, less decisive & more general than the animal instincts but still in the end & for their purpose as sure; & for yet another part she uses the same merely mechanical impulse & involuntary action precisely as in her mistermed inanimate forms of existence. Let us not say that the prodigality of Nature, her squandering of materials, her frequent failure, her apparent freaks and gam- bollings are signs of purposelessness and absence of intelligence. Man with his reason is guilty of the same laches and wanderings. But neither Man nor Nature is therefore purposeless or unintelli- gent. It is Nature who compels Man himself to be other than too strenuously utilitarian, for she knows better than the economist & the utilitarian philosopher. She is an universal intelligence & she has to attend, not only in the sum, but in each detail, to the universal as well as to the particular effect; she has to work out each detail with her eye on the group and not only on the group but the whole kind & not only on the whole kind but the whole world of species. Man, a particular intelligence limited by his reason, is incapable of this largeness; he puts his particular ends in the forefront and neither sees where absorption in them hurts his general well being nor can divine where they clash with the universal purpose. Her failures have an utility – we shall see before long how great an utility; her freaks have a hidden seriousness. And yet above all she remembers that beyond all formal ends, her one great object is the working out of universal delight founded on arrangement as a means, but exceeding its means. Towards that she moves; she takes delight on the way, she takes delight in the work, she takes delight, too, beyond the work. But in all this we anticipate, we speak as if Nature were self-conscious; what we have arrived at is that Nature is teleo- logical, more widely than man, more perfectly than man, & man himself is only teleological because of that in Nature & by the same elementary means & processes as the animal & the plant, though with additions of fresh means peculiar to mind. This, it may be said, does not constitute Intelligence, – for intelligence"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"126 Essays Divine and Human is not only teleological, but discriminative & mentally conscious. Mechanical discrimination, Nature certainly possesses in the highest degree; without it her teleological processes would be impossible. The tendril growing straight through the air comes into contact with a rope, a stick, the stalk of a plant; imme- diately it seizes it as with a Ænger, changes its straight growth for a curled & compressive movement, & winds itself round & round the support. What induces the change? what makes it discriminate the presence of a support & the possibility of this new movement? It is the instinct of the tendril and differs in no way, intrinsically, from the instinct of the newborn pup seizing at once on its mother's teats or the instinct of a man in his more mechanical needs & actions. We see the moon-lotus open its petals to the moon, close them to the touch of the day. In what does this discriminative movement differ from the motion of the hand leaping back from the touch of a Øame, or from the recoiling movement of disgust & displeasure in the nerves from an abhorrent sight or from the recoiling movement of denial & uncongeniality in the mind from a distasteful idea or opinion? Intrinsically, there seems to be no difference; but there is a difference in circumstance. One is not attended with mental self-consciousness, the others are attended with this supremely important element. We think falsely that there is no will in the action of the tendril and the lotus, and no discrimination. There is a will, but not mentalised will; there is discrimination but not mentalised discrimination. It is mechanical, we say, – but do we understand what we mean when we say it, – & we give other names, calling will force, discrimination a natural reaction or an organic tendency. These names are only various masks concealing an intrinsic identity. Even if we could go no farther, we should have gained an enormous step; for we have already the conception of the thing we call Nature as possessing, containing or identical with a great Force of Will placing before itself a vast end & a million complexly related incidental ends, working them out by con- trivance, adaptation, arrangement, device, using an unfailing discrimination & vastly fulÆlling its complex work.

We may deny Intelligence to such a Power, because it does not give signs of mental consciousness & does not in every part of its works use a human or mental intelligence; but our objection is only a metaphysical distinction. Practically, looking out on life & not in upon abstract thought, we can, if we admit this conception, rely on it that the workings of this unintelligent discrimination will be the same as if they were the workings of a universal Intelligence & the aim & means of the mechanical will the aims & means which would be chosen by an Almighty Wisdom. But if we arrive at this certainty, does not Reason itself demand of us that we should admit in Nature or behind it a universal Intelligence and an Almighty Wisdom? If the results are such as these powers would create, must we not admit the presence of these powers as the cause? Which is the truer Rationalism, to admit that the works of Intelligence are produced by Intelligence or to assert that they are produced by a blind Machine unconsciously working out perfection? to admit that the emergence of overt intelligence in humanity is due to the specialised function of a secret intelligence in the universe or to assert that it is the product of a Force to which the very principle of Intelligence is absent? To justify the paradox by saying that things are worked out in a particular way because it is their nature to be worked out in that way, is to play the fool with reason; for it does not carry us an inch beyond the mere fact that they are so worked out, one knows not why. The true reason for the modern reluctance to admit that Nature has intelligence & wisdom or is intelligence & wisdom, is the constant association in the human mind of these things with mentally self-conscious personality. Intelligence, we think, presupposes someone who is intelligent, an ego who possesses & uses this intelligence. An examination of human consciousness shows that this association is an error.

The mental ego in man is a creation & instrument of intelligence and intelligence itself is a force of Nature manifesting itself in a"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"128 Essays Divine and Human rudimentary or advanced state in all animal life. This objection, therefore, vanishes. Not only so, but Science herself by putting the ego in its right place as a product of mind has shown that Intelligence is not a human possession but a force of Nature & therefore an attribute of Nature, a manifestation of the universal Force. The question remains, is it a fundamental & omnipresent attribute or only a development manifested in a select minority of her works? Here again, the difÆculty is that we associate intelligence with an organised mental consciousness. But let us look at & interrogate the facts which Science has brought into our ken. We will glance at only one of them, the Øy catching plant of America. Here is a vegetable organism which has hunger, – shall we say, an unconscious hunger, which needs animal food, which sets a trap for it, as the spider sets it, which feels the moment the victim touches the trap, which immediately closes & seizes the prey, eats & digests it & lies in wait for more. These motions are exactly the motions of the spider's mental intelli- gence altered & conditioned only by the comparative immobility of the plant & conÆned only, so far as we can observe, to the management of this supreme vital need & its satisfaction. Why should we attribute mental intelligence to the spider & none to the plant? Granted that it is rudimentary, organised only for special purposes, still it would seem to be the same natural Force at work in the spider & plant, intelligently devising means to an end & superintending the conduct of the device. If there is no mind in the plant, then, irresistibly, mental intelligence & mechanical intelligence are one & the same thing in essence, & the tendril embracing its prop, the plant catching its prey & the spider seizing its victim are all forms of one Force of action, which we may decline to call Intelligence if we will, but which is obviously the same thing as Intelligence. The difference is between Intelligence organised as mind, & Intelligence not organised but working with a broad elementary purity more unerring, in a way, than the action of mind.

We think so, because we suppose that where there are no animal signs of consciousness, there consciousness cannot and does not exist. This also may be an assumption. We must remember that we know nothing of the tree & the stone except its exterior signs of life or quiescence; our internal knowledge is conÆned to the phenomena of human psychology. But even in this limited sphere there is much that should make us think very deeply and pause very long before we hasten to rash negative assertions. A man sleeps, dreamlessly, he thinks; but we know that all the time consciousness is at work within him, dreaming, always dreaming; of his body & its surroundings he knows nothing, yet that body is of itself conducting all the necessary operations of life. In the man stunned or in trance there is the same phenomenon of a divided being, consciousness mentally active within apart from the body which is mentally even as the tree & the stone, but vitally active & functioning like the tree. Catalepsy presents a still more curious phenomenon of a body dead & inert like the stone, not even vitally active like the tree, but a mind perfectly aware of itself, its medium & its surroundings, though no longer in active possession of the medium and therefore no longer able to act materially on its surroundings. In face of these examples how can we assert that there is no life in the stone, no mind in stone or tree? The premise of the syllogism by which science denies mind to the tree or life to the stone, viz that where there is no outward sign of life or conscious mentality, life & mentality do not exist, is proven to be false. The possibility, even a certain probability presents itself, – in view of the unity of Nature & the om- nipresent intelligence in her works, that the tree & the stone"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"130 Essays Divine and Human are in their totality just such a divided being, a form not yet penetrated & possessed by conscious mind, a conscious intelli- gence within dreaming in itself or, like the cataleptic, aware of its surroundings, but because not yet possessed of its medium (the intelligence in the cataleptic is temporarily dispossessed) unable to show any sign of life or of mentality or to act aggressively on its surroundings. We do not need to stop at this imperfect probability, for the latest researches of psychology make it almost overwhelming in its insistence & next door to the actual proof. We now know that within men there is a dream self or sleep self other than the waking consciousness, active in the stunned, the drugged, the hypnotised, the sleeping, which knows what the waking mind does not know, understands what the waking mind does not understand, remembers accurately what the waking mind has not even taken the trouble to notice. Who is this apparent sleeper in the waking, this waker in the sleeping in comparison with whose comprehensive attentiveness & perfect observation, memory and intelligence our waking consciousness is only a fragmentary & hasty dream? Mark this capital point that this more perfect consciousness within us is not the product of evo- lution, – nowhere in the evolved & waking world is there such a being who remembers & repeats automatically the sounds of a foreign language which is unnoticed jabbering to the in- structed mind, solves spontaneously problems from which the instructed mind has retired bafØed & weary, notices every- thing, understands everything, recalls everything. Therefore this consciousness within is independent of evolution and, conse- quently, we may presume, anterior to evolution. Esha supteshu jagarti, says the Katha Upanishad, This is the Waker in all who sleep. This new psychological research is only in its infancy & can- not tell us what this secret consciousness is, but the knowledge gained by Yoga enables us to assert positively that this is the com- plete mental being within who guides life & body, manomayah pranashariraneta.

In the stone he also is and in the tree, in those sleepers also there is one who wakes; but he has not in those forms got possession yet of the instrument for the purposes of mind; he can only use them for the purposes of vitality in its growth or in its active functioning. We see, therefore, modern psychology, although it still gets away from the only rational & logical conclusion possible on its data, marching inevitably & under the sheer compulsion of facts to the very truths arrived at thousands of years ago by the ancient Rishis. How did they arrive at them? Not by spec- ulation, as the scholars vainly imagine, but by Yoga. For the great stumbling block that has stood in the way of Science is its inability to get inside its object, the necessity under which it labours of building on inferences from external study, – & all its desperate & cruel attempts to make up the deÆciency by vivisection or other ruthless experiments cannot remedy the defect. Yoga enables us to get inside the object by dissolving the artiÆcial barriers of the bodily experience & the mental ego- sense in the observer. It takes us out of the little hold of personal experience and casts us into the great universal currents; takes us out of the personal mind sheath & makes [us] one with universal self and universal mind. Therefore were the ancient Rishis able to see what now we are beginning again to glimpse dimly that not only is Nature herself an inÆnite teleological and discriminative impersonal Force of Intelligence or Conscious- ness, prajna prasrita purani, 2 but that God dwells within & over Nature as inÆnite universal Personality, universal in the universe, individualised as well as universal in the particular form, or self- consciousness who perceives, enjoys & conducts to their end its vast & complex workings.

This is ignorance or cosmic illusion, the mistake of the mind & senses, from which the Magician Himself, Master of the Illusion, is calling on us to escape. This false valuation of the world is the Maya of the Gita and can be surmounted without abandoning either action or world-existence. But in addition, the whole of universal existence is in this sense an illusion of Maya that it is not an unchanging transcendent and Ænal reality of things but only a symbolical reality; it is a valuation of the reality of Brahman in the terms of cosmic consciousness. All these objects we see or are mentally aware of as objectively existing, are only forms of consciousness. They are the thing- in-itself turned Ærst into terms & ideas born of a movement or rhythmic process of consciousness and then objectivised, in con- sciousness itself and not really external to it. They have therefore a Æxed conventional reality, but not an eternally durable essential reality; they are symbols, not altogether the thing symbolised, means of knowledge, not altogether the thing known. To look at it from another point of view Existence or Brahman has two fundamental states of consciousness, cosmic consciousness and transcendental consciousness. To cosmic consciousness the world is real as a direct Ærst term expressing the inexpressible; to transcendental consciousness the world is only a secondary & indirect term expressing the inexpressible. When I have the cosmic consciousness, I see the world as my Self manifested; in transcendental consciousness I see the world not as the manifes- tation of my Self but as a manifestation of something I choose to be to my Self-consciousness.

I say tiger in English; I might equally have spoken Sanscrit & used the word shardula; it would have made no difference to the tiger or to myself, but only to my play with the symbols of speech and thought. So it is with Brahman & the universe, the Thing in itself and its symbols with their Æxed conventional values, some of which are relative to the general consciousness & some to the individual consciousness of the symbol-being. Matter, Mind, Life for instance are general symbols with a Æxed general value to God in His cosmic consciousness; but they have a different individual value, make a different impression or represent them- selves differently, as we say, to myself, to the ant or to the god and angel. This perception of the purely conventional value of form & name in the Universe is expressed in metaphysics by the formula that the world is a creation of Para Maya or supreme Cosmic Illusion. It does not follow that the world is unreal or has no existence worth the name. None of the ancient Scriptures of Hinduism afÆrms the unreality of the world, nor is it a logical conse- quence of the great but remote and difÆcult truth words are so inadequate to express. We must remember that all these terms, Maya, illusion, dream, unreality, relative reality, conventional value, are merely verbal Ægures and must not be pressed with a too literal scholastic or logical insistence. They are like the paint-brush hurled by the painter at his picture in desperation at not arriving at the effect he wanted; they are stones thrown at the truth, not the truth itself. We shall see this clearly enough when we come to look at the Cosmos from quite another stand- point, – the standpoint not of Maya, but Lila. 1 But certain great metaphysical minds, not perceiving sufÆciently that words like everything else have only conventional values and are symbols of a truth which is in itself inexpressible, have drawn from the 1 Illusion is itself an illusion.

They have condemned the whole world as a miser- able & lying dream, all the more hateful & proÆtless for a certain element of ineffugable reality which the more clearsighted part of their minds was compelled to realise & partially to admit. The truth in their premises has made their doctrines a mighty instrument for the liberation of great & austere souls, the error in their conclusion has afØicted humanity with the vain & barren gospel of the vanity not only of false mundane existence, but of all mundane existence. In the extreme forms of this view both nature & supernature, man & God are lies of consciousness, myths of a cosmic dream & not worth accepting. Amelioration is a chimera, divinity a lure and only absorption in a transmun- dane impersonal existence worth pursuing. The worshippers of God, the seekers after human perfection, those who would raise humanity from nature to supernature, Ænd in their path two great stumbling blocks, on one side, the lower trend of Nature to persist in its past gains which represents itself in the besotted naturalism of the practical man & the worldling and on the other, this grand overshooting of the mark represented not only by the world-Øeeing ascetic, who is after all, within his rights, but by the depressing pessimism of the ignorant who mean neither to Øee the world, nor, if they did, could rise to the real grandeur of asceticism, but are still imbued intellectually & overshadowed in temperament by these high & fatal doctrines. A better day will dawn for India when the shadow is lifted and the Indian mental consciousness without renouncing the truth of Maya, perceives that it is only a partial explanation of existence. Mundane ex- istence is not indispensable either to God's being or to God's bliss, but it is not therefore a vanity; nor is a liberated mundane existence – liberated in God – either a vain or a false existence. The ordinary doctrine of Maya is not a simple truth, but proceeds upon three distinct spiritual perceptions.

We have said that & we shall see that we are not compelled by this perception to set down the world as a myth or a valueless convention. Nor would the Mayavadin himself have been brought to this extreme conclusion if he had not brought into the purity of this highest soul-experience his two other perceptions. The second of these, the lowest, is the perception of the lower or Apara Maya which I have indicated in the opening of this essay – the perception of the system of false values put by mind & sense on the symbol facts of the universe. At a certain stage of our mental culture it is easy to see that the senses are deceiving guides, all mental opinions & judgments uncertain, partial & haunted & pursued by doubt, the world not a reality in the sense in which the mind takes it for a reality, in the sense in which the senses only occupied by & only careful of the practical values of things, their vyavaharic artha, deal with it as a reality. Reaching this stage the mind arrives at this perception that all its values for the world being false, perhaps it is because there is no true value or only a true value not conceivable to the mind, and from this idea it is easy for our impatient human nature to stride to the conclusion that so it is & all existence or all world-existence at least is illusory, a sensation born of nothingness, a play of zeros. Hence Buddhism, the sensational Agnostic philosophies, Mayavada. Again, it is easy at a certain stage of moral culture to perceive that the moral values put by the emotions, passions and aspirations on actions & experiences are false values, that the objects of our sins are not worth sinning for & even that our principles & values do not stand in the shock of the world's actualities, but are, they too, conventional values which we do not Ænd to be binding on the great march of Nature. From this it is natural & right to come to vairagya or dissatisfaction with a life of false valuations and very easy to stride forward, again in the impatience of our imperfect human nature, to the consummation of an entire vairagya, not only dissatisfaction with a false moral life, but disgust with life of any sort & the conclusion of the vanity of world-existence.

For at a certain stage of spiritual culture we come to the perception of the world as a system of mere consciousness values in Parabrahman or to a middle term, the experience, which was probably the decisive factor in the minds of great spiritual seekers like Shankara, of the pure & bright impersonal Sachchidananda beyond, unaffected by & apparently remote from all cosmic existence. Observing intellectually through the mind this great experience, the conclusion is natural & almost inevitable that this Pure & Bright One regards the universe as a mirage, an unreality, a dream. But these are only the terms, the word-values & conventional idea-values into which mind then translates this fact of unaffected transcendence; & it so translates it because these are the terms it is itself accustomed to apply to anything which is beyond it, remote from it, not practically affecting it in tangible relations. The mind engrossed in matter at Ærst accepts only an objective reality; everything not objectivised or apparently capable of some objective expression it calls a lie, a mirage, a dream, an unreality or, if it is favourably disposed an ideal. When, afterwards, it corrects its views, the Ærst thing it does is to reverse its values; coming into a region & level where life in the material world seems remote, unspiritual or apparently not capable of spiritual realisation, it immediately applies here its old expressions dream, mirage, lie, unreality or mere false idea and transfers from object to spirit its exclusive & intolerant use of the word-symbol reality. Add to this mental translation into its own conventional word-values of the fact of unaffected transcendence the intellectual conclusions & temper- amental repulsions of mental & moral vairagya, both together affecting & disÆguring the idea of the world as a system of consciousness values and we have Mayavada."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Section Four 1914 ± 1919"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Beginning and the End Who knows the beginning of things or what mind has ever embraced their end?

The word existence unduly limits it; eternity & inÆnity are too petty conceptions; the term Being is an x representing not an unknown but an unknowable value. All values proceed from the Brahman, but it is itself beyond all values. This existence is an incalculable Fact in which all possible opposites meet; its opposites are in truth identities. It is neither one nor many and yet both one and many. Numberlessness increases in it and extends till it reaches unity; unity broken cannot stop short of numberlessness.

Earth-life is one self-chosen habitation of a great Divinity and his aeonic will is to change it from a blind prison into his splendid mansion and high heaven-reaching temple. The nature of the Divinity in the world is an enigma to the mind, but to our enlarging consciousness it will appear as a presence simple and inevitable.

Out of a vast cosmic inconscience and inertia and insensibility, an initial disguise that is almost non-existence, the Spirit in Mat- ter has chosen to evolve and slowly shape, as if in a grudging and gradually yielding material, its might and light and inÆnity and beatitude. The signiÆcance of the terrestrial evolution lies in this slow and progressive liberation of some latent indwelling Spirit. The heart of its mystery is the difÆcult appearance, the tardy be- coming of a divine Something or Someone already involved in physical Nature. The Spirit is there with all its potential forces in a Ærst formal basis of its own supporting, yet resistant substance. Its greater subsequent and deliberately emerging movements, life and mind and intuition and soul and supermind and the light of the Godhead are already there, locked up and obscurely compressed into the initial power and Ærst expressive values of Matter. Before there could be any evolution, there must needs be this involution of the Divine All that is to emerge. Otherwise there would have been not an ordered and signiÆcant evolution, but a successive creation of things unforeseeable, not contained in their antecedents, not their inevitable consequences or right followers in sequence. This world is not an apparent order fortuitously managed by an inexplicable Chance.

Mentally conceivable, each of these solutions can explain one side or appearance of things; but it is a greater truth that can alone successfully join all the aspects and illumine all the facts of the enigma. If all were indeed a result of cosmic Chance, there would be no necessity of a new advance; nothing beyond mind need appear in the material world, – as indeed there was then no necessity for even mind to arise at all out of the meaning- less blind material whirl.

No frail thinking brain should have been there to labour over the quite sufÆcient cogs and springs and pistons of the Ærst unerring machine. A super- mind added on this brilliant and painful complication would be still more a superØuity and a luminous insolence; it could be nothing more than a false pretension of transitory consciousness to govern and possess the greater inconscient Force that is its creator. Or if an experimenting, external and therefore limited Cre- ator were the inventor of the animal's suffering life and man's fumbling mind and this huge mainly unused and useless uni- verse, there was no reason why he should not have stopped short with the construction of a mental intelligence in his creatures, content with the difÆcult ingenuity of his labour. Even if he were all-powerful and all-wise, he might well pause there, – for if he went farther, the creature would be in danger of rising too near to the level of his Maker. But if this is the truth of things that an inÆnite Spirit, an eternal Divine Presence and Consciousness and Force and Bliss is involved and hidden here and slowly emerges, then is it in- evitable that its powers or the ascending degrees of its one power should emerge too one after the other till the whole glory is manifested, a mighty divine Fact embodied and dynamic and visible.

This full power of the consciousness is supermind or gnosis, – supermind because to reach it we have to pass beyond and turn upon mind as the mind itself has passed and turned upon life and inconscient matter and gnosis because it is eternally self-possessed of Truth and in its very stuff and nature it is dynamic substance of knowledge. The true knowledge of things is denied to our reason, be- cause that is not our spirit's greatest essential power but only an expedient, a transitional instrument meant to deal with the appearance of things and their phenomenal process. True knowl- edge commences only when our consciousness can pass beyond its present normal limit in man: for then it becomes directly aware of its self and of the Power in the world and begins to have at least an initial knowledge by identity which is the sole true knowledge. Henceforward it knows and sees, no longer by the reason groping among external data, but by an ever increasing and always more luminous self-illumining and all illuminating experience.

This gradual becoming of the Divine out of its own phenomenal opposites is the meaning and purpose of the terrestrial evolution. Evolution in its essence is not the development of a more and more organised body or a more and more efficient life — these are only its machinery and outward circumstance. Evolution is the strife of a Consciousness somnambulised in Matter to wake and be free and find and possess itself and all its possibilities to the very utmost and widest, to the very last and highest. Evolution is the emancipation of a self-revealing Soul secret in Form and Force, the slow becoming of a Godhead, the growth of a Spirit. In this evolution mental man is not the goal and end, the completing value, the highest last significance; he is too small and imperfect to be the crown of all this travail of Nature. Man is not final, but a middle term only, a transitional being, an instrumental intermediate creature. This character of evolution and this mediary position of man are not at first apparent; for to the outward eye it would seem as if evolution, the physical evolution at least were finished long ago leaving man behind as its poor best result and no new beings or superior creations were to be expected any longer. But this appears to us only so long as we look at forms and outsides only and not at the inner significances of the whole process. Matter, body, life even are the first terms necessary for the work that had to be done. New living forms may no longer be appearing freely, but this is because it is not, or at least it is not primarily, new living forms that the Force of evolution is now busied with evolving, but new powers of consciousness. When Nature, the Divine Power, had formed a body erect and empowered to think, to devise, to inquire into itself and things and work consciously both on things and self, she had what she wanted for her secret aim; relegating all else to the sphere of secondary movements, she turned toward that long-hidden aim her main highest forces. For all till then was a long stren- uously slow preparation; but throughout it the development of consciousness in which the appearance of man was the crucial"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Evolution of Consciousness 167 turning point had been kept wrapped within her as her ultimate business and true purpose. This slow preparation of Nature covered immense aeons of time and inÆnities of space in which they appeared to be her only business; the real business strikes on our view at least when we look with the outward eye of reason as if it came only as a fortuitous accident, in or near the end, for a span of time and in a speck and hardly noticeable corner of one of the smallest provinces of a possibly minor universe among these many boundless Ænites, these countless universes. If it were so, we could still reply that time and space matter not to the InÆnite and Eternal; it is not a waste of labour for That – as it would be for our brief death-driven existences – to work for trillions of years in order to Øower only for a moment. But that paradox too is only an appearance – for the history of this single earth is not all the story of evolution – other earths there are even now elsewhere, and even here many earth-cycles came before us, and many are those that will come hereafter. Nature laboured for innumerable millions of years to create a material universe of Øaming suns and systems; for a lesser but still interminable series of millions she stooped to make this earth a habitable planet. For all that incalculable time she was or seemed busy only with the evolution of Matter; life and mind were kept secret in an apparent non-existence. But the time came when life could manifest, a vibration in the metal, a growing and seeking, a drawing in and a feeling outward in the plant, an instinctive force and sense, a nexus of joy and pain and hunger and emotion and fear and struggle in the animal, – a Ærst organised consciousness, the beginning of the long-planned miracle. Thenceforward she was busy no more exclusively with matter for its own sake, but most with palpitant plasmic matter useful for the expression of life; the evolution of life was now her one intent purpose. And slowly too mind manifested in life, an intensely feeling, a crude thinking and planning vital mind in the animal, but in man the full organisation and apparatus, the developing if yet imperfect mental being, the Manu, the think- ing, devising, aspiring, already self-conscient creature. And from"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"168 Essays Divine and Human that time onward the growth of mind rather than any radical change of life became her shining preoccupation, her wonderful wager. Body appeared to evolve no more; life itself evolved little or only so much in its cycles as would serve to express Mind heightening and widening itself in the living body; an unseen internal evolution was now Nature's great passion and purpose. And if Mind were all that consciousness could achieve, if Mind were the secret Godhead, if there were nothing higher, larger, [no] more miraculous ranges, man could be left to fulÆl mind and complete his own being and there would or need be nothing here beyond him, carrying consciousness to its summits, extending it to its unwalled vastnesses, plunging with it into depths unfathomable; he would by perfecting himself consum- mate Nature. Evolution would end in a Man-God, crown of the earthly cycles. But Mind is not all; for beyond mind is a greater conscious- ness; there is a supermind and spirit. As Nature laboured in the animal, the vital being, till she could manifest out of him man, the Manu, the thinker, so she is labouring in man, the mental being till she can manifest out of him a spiritual and supramental godhead, the truth conscious Seer, the knower by identity, the embodied Transcendental and Universal in the individual nature. From the clod and metal to the plant, from the plant to the animal, from the animal to man, so much has she completed of her journey; a huge stretch or a stupendous leap still remains before her. As from matter to life, from life to mind, so now she must pass from mind to supermind, from man to superman; this is the gulf that she has to bridge, the supreme miracle that she has to perform before she can rest from her struggle and discon- tent and stand in the radiance of that supreme consciousness, gloriÆed, transmuted, satisÆed with her labour.

The ascent can only be achieved by a one-centred all- gathering upward aspiration of the soul and mind and life and body; the descent can only come by a call of the whole being towards the inÆnite and eternal Divine. If this call and this aspiration are there, or if by any means they can be born and grow constantly and seize all the nature, then and then only a supramental uplifting and transformation becomes possible. The call and the aspiration are only Ærst conditions; there must be along with them and brought by their effective intensity an opening of all the being to the Divine and a total surrender. This opening is a throwing wide of all the nature on all its levels and in all its parts to receive into itself without limits the greater divine Consciousness which is there already above and behind and englobing this mortal half-conscious existence. In the receiving there must be no inability to contain, no breaking down of anything in the system, mind or life or nerve or body under the transmuting stress. There must be an endless receptiv- ity, an always increasing capacity to bear an ever stronger and more and more insistent action of the divine Force. Otherwise nothing great and permanent can be done; the Yoga will end in a break-down or an inert stoppage or a stultifying or a disastrous arrest in a process which must be absolute and integral if it is not [to] be a failure. But since no human system has this endless receptivity and unfailing capacity, the supramental Yoga can succeed only if the Divine Force as it descends increases the personal power and equates the strength that receives with the Force that enters from above to work in the nature.

Man cannot by his own effort make himself more than man; the mental being cannot by his own unaided force change himself into a supramental spirit. A descent of the Divine Nature can alone divinise the human receptacle. For the powers of our mind, life and body are bound to their own limitations and, however high they may rise or however widely expand, they cannot rise above their natural ultimate limits or expand beyond them. But, still, mental man can open to what is beyond him and call down a supramental Light, Truth and Power to work in him and do what the mind cannot do. If mind cannot by effort become what is beyond mind, supermind can descend and transform mind into its own substance. If the supramental Power is allowed by man's discerning as- sent and vigilant surrender to act according to its own profound and subtle insight and Øexible potency, it will bring about slowly or swiftly a divine transformation of our present semiperfect nature. This descent, this working is not without its possibility of calamitous fall and danger. If the human mind or the vital desire seizes hold on the descending force and tries to use it according to its own limited and erring ideas or Øawed and egoistic impulses, – and this is inevitable in some degree until this lower mor- tal has learned something of the way of that greater immortal nature, – stumblings and deviations, hard and seemingly insu- perable obstacles and wounds and suffering cannot be escaped and even death or utter downfall are not impossible. Only when the conscious integral surrender to the Divine has been learned by mind and life and body, can the way of the Yoga become easy, straight, swift and safe. And it must be a surrender and an opening to the Divine alone and to no other.

Human life on earth can then never grow into anything fundamentally other, better or more perfect than it is now. The hope that by using our reason and observing or utilising the laws of Nature we can arrive at a perfect life here is futile, for our nature here being itself ignorant and imperfect can- not arrive at anything better than a mitigated imperfection and ignorance.

This is the Ærst postulate indispensable for our spiritual seeking – for on no other base can we found the highest knowledge and the highest life. All time moves in the Eternal; all space is spread in the InÆnite; all creatures and creations live by that in them which is Divine. This is patently true of an inner spiritual but also proves in the end to be true of this outer space and time. It is known to our inmost being that it lives because it is part of the Divine, but it is true also of the external and phenomenal creature com- pounded of ignorant Mind, blind life and subconscious Matter. A secret Self is the Alpha and Omega of this manifested existence; it is also the constant term, the omnipresent x into which all things resolve separately or together and which is their sum, their constituting material and their essence. All here is secretly the Divine, all is the Eternal, all is the InÆnite. But this secret truth of things is contradicted by the world's external appearances, it is denied by all the facts placed before us by our mind and senses, inconsistent with the sorrow and suffering of the world, incompatible with the imperfection of living beings and the unchangeable inconscience of things. What then pushes the mind to afÆrm it? what compels us to admit a seeing of things which is in conØict with our outer seeing and experience?

In the management of his world the much that is undivine prevails easily over the little that is divine or they are inextricably mixed together. The ideal fails in practice, religion degenerates quickly into a settled sectarian fanaticism or formality, the triumphant good turns into an organised evil. The Christian doctrine of the fall, the Indian idea of the wandering of the Soul in a cosmic illusion or the sceptic afÆrmation of an inconscient material Nature producing the freak of consciousness seems often to be the kernel of the whole matter. And yet if we go deep enough into ourselves, we strike against something valid that proves to be a veiled divine element which afÆrms its immortality, Soul. If we go beyond our embodied mind and senses we break suddenly into something permanent that feels itself to be eternal and inÆnite, that cannot see itself as anything else and we also cannot conceive of it as anything else, an inÆnite Self, an eternal Spirit. Moreover in our most secret essence we are convinced of perfection or of perfectibility – perfection in our deepest spiritual being, perfectibility in our nature; we have the instinct and intuition of the Divine. Even to Time and Space our mind cannot Æx or conceive a beginning or an end; it cannot conceive a Ærst bound or a last, a primary or ultimate moment without at once looking beyond it.

The instruments by which we question Nature in order to Ænd out what is ascertainable have been proved to give only the results which are already contained in the question or in the questioner. Science gives us the measures and process of things within the physical limit, but it has failed [to] tell us what things are, their Ænal origin or their reason of existence. In all this questing by one end or the other we cannot get beyond ourselves and it is better then to look into the inner side of ourselves, – why should we limit ourselves only to our responses to an outer evidence? Let us explore ourselves and not only our sense or perception of what is around us. And in ourselves let us look not only at our surfaces but at the inner and the inmost of our being and nature. This self-knowledge pursued far enough shows us a deeper than the surface mind and a deeper than the physical sense, a profounder than the outward life. It shows us also a Beyond- Mind and Beyond-Sense, a Beyond-Life; the limited passes into [the] illimitable.

To suppose that the Timeless is debarred by its timelessness from throwing itself out in a movement of Time and that Time therefore and all in time is an illusion or to suppose that Time alone exists and we are its temporal creations is to impose the ignorance and limitation of our little surface consciousness on the Divine Eternal.

Non- Existence is a term created by the mind and has no absolute signiÆcance; there is no such thing as an absolute Nihil or Zero. It is agreed even by the philosophies of the Nihil, Tao or Zero (Sunya) that the Non-Existence of which they speak is a Nought in which all is and from which all comes. Tao, Nihil or Zero is not different from the Absolute or the Supreme Brahman of Vedanta; it is only another way of describing or naming it. The Supreme is an Existence beyond what we know of our existence and therefore only it can seem to our mind as a Zero, a Nihil, a Non-Existence. There is nothing there of what we know as existence, for though all is in Tao, yet all is there in a way of which our mind can have no conception or experience, therefore to the mind it has no reality and brings no concept of existence. The manifestation in the Ignorance, that in which we live, has also been described as Asat, a non-existence, because it is not real, eternal, inÆnite, divine; it must therefore be an illusion, since only That exists and nothing else. But even Illusionism agrees that the manifested world is not without reality, – it is practically real, but not eternal. Moreover manifestation even if illusory in this sense, has no end or beginning in itself, but only to the soul that withdraws from it. It goes on existing eternally to other souls, it goes on existing to the Eternal. It is in the eternal consciousness that it exists, though apart from that consciousness it has no existence. Moreover the stuff of which it is made is not nothingness or void, but the Eternal itself which manifests it from itself and out of its own substance cast into form and force.

But this is to create a problem where there is none. We do nothing of the kind; what we do is to perceive by the senses a world of stability in constant motion, of sameness in spite of change. It is the world that is like that; we do not make it so; our senses receive, they do not create; if there is an error in their perceptions or images it is a passive imperfection of sensing that causes the wrong or altered image, it is not a willed and dynamic change like the liberties the artist takes with Nature. Men are always changing, but man has a permanent charac- ter which does not alter. Tigers differ from each other and from themselves in the process of time, but the tiger is always the same animal and always as such recognisable. It is the details that vary and change, the type, the fundamental pattern is constant. So far our senses and our mind standing upon their data do not betray or deceive us. If they see a world that is stable and the same in spite of constant mobility and mutation, it is because the world is like that and it is therefore that we have to see it so and cannot see it otherwise. If there is a problem it is not what we make of it, not a problem of our psychology but why it is so, what is behind the mobility of the world and its stability, what is the cause or the signiÆcance or reality of it. There is no doubt the problem of what are mind and sense and their nature, their reality, their relation to the world and its cause or signiÆcance; but that too is a problem of metaphysics. Are there then two worlds, the one changing and existing in time, the other changeless and eternal? Or are there rather two ways of knowing one and the same world?

It cannot be the truth that man belongs to one world and men in their mutability to another or that in seeing the changes and variations of the species tiger we are seeing the world in one way and when we see the persistence of type of the species we are knowing it in a different way. These artiÆcial problems are the result of looking at words and concepts instead of things; we concentrate on the words and concepts ™sameness∫ and ™change∫, see that they represent as abstractions ideas that stand opposed to each other, imagine that they are as opposed in fact as in our minds, are incompatible and therefore cannot coexist in the same world or cannot be true at the same time or in the same world-perception. As a matter of fact there is no such incompatibility; something that is permanently the same may be in constant change of its details of existence without losing its constant fundamental sameness. There is no reason why something should not be transient (not therefore unreal) in many of its phenomena, yet permanent in itself, in its being, whether that permanence be only a duration in time or eternal. No doubt, two worlds may meet, world of mind or spirit enter into world of Matter, but then their elements combine into one world, a world let us say of mind-informed or spirit-governed Matter; it is not two separate worlds that we are seeing at the same time and confusing together by the erroneous action of our mind and senses. Our souls, our minds may belong by origination to the mind world or spirit world, but here they are in the same world as the changing life and body and in so seeing it, we make no error. 32 A philosophy of change? 1 But what is change? In ordinary par- lance change means passage from one condition to another and that would seem to imply passage from one status to another status.

So it would seem that change is not something isolated which is the sole original and eternal reality, but it is something dependent on status, and if status were non-existent, change also could not exist. For we have to ask, when you speak of change as alone real, change of what, from what, to what? Without this ™what∫ change could not be. Change is evidently the change of some form or state of existence from one condition to another condition. Otherwise, what is it? Is it itself fundamental and absolute, not explicable or deÆnable by any other term than itself, perceivable and in- telligible as the sole reality by a naked intuition which feels and cries out ™Change = reality∫ and then falls dumb and can say no more? An object changes, a person changes, a condition of things changes. But can it be said that the object is no real object but only a continuity of change, or that a person is not a person but a continuity of change, a condition of things is not a con- dition and there are no things but there is only a continuity of change? This seems to be an illustration of the besetting sin of metaphysics – to exalt a word into a reality or an idea into a reality – without fathoming what is the reality which it tries to indicate. For to label with a word or name is not to fathom and to deÆne, to erect a concept is not to fathom. Fathom for us then what is change before you ask us to accept it as the only reality. You may say I have fathomed it, I have seen it to be the one constant real, but do not ask me to deÆne what it is; ™listen rather in silence to the silence of Nature and you too will fathom∫. But what if, so listening, I fathom other realities than change – let us say, immutable being as well as mutable force, status as well as change?

In the world of our experience contradictories [are] often complements and necessary to each other's existence. Change is possible only if there is a status from which to change; but status again exists only as a step that pauses, a step in the continuous passage of change or a step on which change pauses before it passes on to another step in its creative passage. And behind this relation is a duality of eternal status and eternal motion and behind this duality is something that is neither status nor change but contains both as its aspects – and That is likely to be the true Reality. Existence, Consciousness-Force, Bliss 33 The nature of the Eternal is inÆnite Being, the nature of Being is Self-Awareness and all-Awareness or Consciousness, the nature of conscious Being is conscious Force aware of its self and its action, the nature of conscious self-awareness is inÆnite Bliss[.] 34 Identity is the Ærst truth of existence; division is the second truth; all division is a division in oneness. There is one Existence which looks at itself from many self-divided unities observing other similar and dissimilar self-divided unities by the device of division. Being is one; division is a device or a secondary condition of consciousness; but the primary truth of consciousness also is a truth of oneness and identity. One consciousness organised in many self-divided unities of consciousness is the subjective nature of existence."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"204 Essays Divine and Human The objective side of consciousness is force, because con- sciousness is a power of being. The eternal primary action of this force is to make for its own consciousness forms or Ægures of its being. All force is inherently conscious force. Inhabiting and sup- porting every individual or universal form of being there is and must be some conscious power of being. But conscious force has the faculty of absorbing itself in its works and forms; there is in consciousness the power of self-oblivion. This self-oblivion is the primary phenomenon of material existence. But as [in] the sleeping or unconscious or self-oblivious man there is a subliminal self which neither sleeps nor forgets itself nor is un- conscious, so in what appears to [be] inconscient form worked by an inconscient force or power of being there is, discoverable by extending knowledge, such a conscious power and that must be part of the conscious force of being of the one existence. The nature of being aware of itself, in possession of all its consciousness and force is the inherent delight of its own exis- tence. For experience shows that all complete possession of self is delight, only imperfection of possession creates imperfection or apparent absence of delight. But the one existence takes an equal delight in all the universal forms and Ægures of its own being, and this delight is the cause and support of universal and individual existence. For this reason all creation also and all action of force has secretly or overtly delight or a seeking for delight or [?some] attraction as its Ærst motive cause, although the apparent object or aim of the action may seem to be of a different character. These truths do not appear entirely to us because we start from division but they become self-evident when we get to a larger consciousness open to the conscious unity underlying things or one with the one conscious existence. The One Existence whether we call it or him God, Brahman, Purusha or by some other name is in its or his nature inÆnite existence aware of itself and its own eternal bliss of existence.

It is therefore by a process of Sat developing its own Ananda through Tapas which is Chit that the Absolute appears as the extended, the eternal as the evolutionary, Brahman as the world. He who would live perfectly must know Life, he who would know Life, must know Sacchidananda. Pleasure is not Ananda; it is a half-successful attempt to grasp at Ananda by means which ensure a relapse into pain. Therefore it is that pleasure can never be an enduring possession. It is in its nature transient and fugitive. Pain itself is obviously not Ananda; neither is it in itself anything positive, real and necessary. It has only a negative reality. It is a recoil caused by the inability to command pleasure from certain contacts which becomes habitual in our consciousness and, long ingrained in it, deludes us with the appearance of a law. We can rise above transitory pleasure; we can get rid of the possibility of pain. Pleasure, therefore, cannot be the end & aim of life; for the true object and condition of Life is Ananda and Ananda is some- thing in its nature one, unconditioned and inÆnite. If we make pleasure the object of life, then we also make pain the condition of life. The two go together and are inseparable companions. You cannot have one for your bed-fellow without making a life- companion of the other. They are husband and wife and, though perpetually quarrelling, will not hear of divorce. But neither is pain the necessary condition of life, as the Buddhists say, nor is extinction of sensation the condition of bliss. 36 The world lives in and by Ananda.

A world which is essentially a world of bliss – this was the ancient Vedantic vision, the drishti of the Vedic drashta, which differentiates Hinduism in its early virility from the cosmic sorrow of Buddhism and the cosmic disillusionment of Mayavada. But it is possible to fall from this Bliss, not to realise it with the lower nature, in the Apara Prakriti, not to be able to grasp and possess it. Two things are necessary for the fullness of man's bliss, – the fullness of his being and the fullness of his knowledge creating by their union the fullness of his strength in all its manifestations, viryam, balam, bhrajas, tejas, ojas. For Ananda, Sat & Chit make one reality, and Chit is in its outward working pure force to which our Rishis gave the name of Tapas. To attain even here upon earth this full- ness of bliss dependent upon fullness of existence, illumination and force, must always be humanity's drift, man's collective endeavour. To attain it within himself here and beyond, iha ca amutra ca, must always be the drift of the human unit, the individual's endeavour. Wherever the knowledge in him thinks it can grasp this bliss, it will Æx its heaven. This is Swarga, Vaikuntha, Goloka; this is Nirvana. 37 The bliss of the Brahman can be described as the eternity of an uninterrupted supreme ecstasy. There is no opposition or incom- patibility between these two states in the nature of the Brahman. Bliss there is the keen height and core of peace; peace there is the intimate core and essence of bliss. There is no turbidity or turbulence in the being of the Brahman; its ineffable poignancy is eternal in its self-poise. The essential mark of the descent of the consciousness from its highest grade in the supreme spirit is the constant diminu- tion of the power of Sachchidananda, the intensity of its force, force of being, force of consciousness, force of bliss.

The degree and amount of pain which mind, life and body can bear is by our human standards considerable; but their ca- pacity for pleasure is very limited and pale in its intensity, low in its degree. What we call ecstasy would seem to a god to be ridiculously thin and vapid and edgeless. Its capacity of duration also is pitifully brief and measurable by the moments. 38 In experience even on the spiritual plane so long as we do not transcend the spirit in mind, there is a difference between peace and Ananda. Peace is the Divine static, Ananda the Divine dy- namic. Peace is a negative-positive; it is positive of itself, of status, of eternity, of the essential, of the abstract-concrete, of force in rest. It is or tends to be negative of all that is less than itself, contradictory to itself or more than itself, of the dynamic, of action, of creation, of time and happening, of the substantial concrete, of force in motion. Or when it allows these things or even feels or supports them, it is with a certain disinterested separateness. It has essentially the character of the Witness Spirit or at the most of the disinterested Witness-Creator. Ananda is in its every Æbre a positive of positives. It afÆrms and rejoices in all that is native to peace, but it afÆrms too and rejoices in all that peace negates or regards with a sovereign separate- ness. Ananda is an all embracing and creative force. There can be in the world's tangle of conØicting forces an Ananda of pain and suffering and in the full manifestation pain and suffering no longer remain themselves but are transformed into Ananda.

This concession comes to nothing; for it means that other spiritual experiences are only temporarily helpful delusions or helpful half truths and the only true truth is Adwaita. The dispute remains; for all the other schools also will claim theirs as the highest truth.

We must Ærst give this admission to the defence for whatever it is worth, that Illusionism does not afÆrm the abso- lute non-existence of the universe but only that it is an existence which is in its beginning and its end a non-existence and in its middle it is an existence which amounts to non-existence. It is real while it lasts to the mind that creates it; but it is not really real, – it is only phenomenally existent, like a dream, like a hallucination, like the imaginations of a person in delirium. Three questions arise from this proposition. Is this hallucinatory creation of the universe a truth or is the theory itself a halluci- nation of the logical mind or of the experiencing consciousness? Secondly, if true, how does the illusion come about and how is it possible? Thirdly, who is the victim of the hallucination? The whole theory arises from and turns on one original proposition of which it is the logical consequence. It is this that Brahman the one real, original and eternal existence is, Ærstly, self-existent, secondly, featureless and relationless, thirdly, un- modiÆable, immutable, incapable therefore of developing fea- ture and relation, fourthly, solely existent, for there is and can be nothing else but that in existence. None of these original positions about the Brahman imposes itself irrefutably upon the intellect; there are philosophies which deny them one and all and with quite as good a show of logic as any the logical apparatus of the Mayavada can furnish us. In fact, what we Ærst see as the one experience of our consciousness is not this at all, but just the opposite. We see that every thing reduces itself not to an existence at all, but to a continuity of the action of Force, Karma as the Buddhists call it. We see that this action of Force exists only by an inÆnite Øux of feature and relation, the stream of the Buddhist Ægure. Apart from that it is nothing, it is the Buddhist sunya or Nihil, and the reduction of the universe to"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Nature: The World-Manifestation 211 its original starting point, the escape out of it is not a return to the self-existent, but a return to Nihil, a Nirvana or extinction. Far, then, from being immutable and incapable of modiÆcation, it is in its very nature a constant modiÆcation and mutation. Eliminate the stream of becoming and the result is not Being, but a zero. This is the difÆculty which the Mayavada has to surmount, the logic which it has to refute. For it cannot be denied that the universe, the thing from which all our conscious experience starts, is such a constant stream of becoming, a round of mutations and modiÆcations, a mass of features and relations. The question is how is it main- tained? what is [it] that gives an appearance of permanence to the impermanent, of stability to the unstable, of a sum of eternal sameness in which all the elements of the sum are in constant instability and all capable of mutation? The Buddhist admits that it is done by an action of consciousness, by idea and association, vijnana, sanskara; but ideas and associations are themselves Karma, action of Force, themselves impermanent, only they create an appearance of permanence, by always acting in the same round, creating the same combination of forms and elements, as the Øame and stream appear always the same, though that which constitutes them is always impermanent. The modern Materialist says that it is material Force or an eternal Energy which takes the form of Matter and follows always the same inherent law of action. The Mayavadin says on the contrary that it is Consciousness, but a consciousness which is in its reality immutable and unmodiÆable self-existence, only it produces a phenomenon of constant modiÆcation and mutation. How is this possible? There lies the riddle, for it is a direct self- contradiction. To escape from it, he alleges that the phenomenon has no reality at all, but is an illusion. To deal with this theory at all, we have Ærst to admit that consciousness is the cause and continent of the universe and that it exists only in consciousness and not at all in itself. How doeshe[ the Mayavadin ] propose to prove it? It is by an ap- peal to reason and experience. Our reason tells us that we have no knowledge of the existence of the universe except by our"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"212 Essays Divine and Human conscious mentality, no possibility of knowing it; the universe can only be allowed to exist by a consciousness admitting its existence, supporting it by its assent. If by any chance, law or process our consciousness can cease Ænally to be aware of the universe, then so far as we are concerned, the universe no longer exists; it is annulled to us, it was an illusion from which we are released, as when a dream or hallucination ceases. Any such Ænal upshot proves that originally also the universe was non-existent, for otherwise, if it had existed for us eternally without beginning, it would also continue for us eternally without end. But even if it ceases for us, it still continues in existence, is capable of being observed and lived in by others. How is that? We must suppose, that since it exists cosmically, its existence must be admitted and supported by the assent of a universal consciousness by which and for which it is or rather seems to be. Well, if by any chance, law or process this universal consciousness ceases Ænally to be aware of the universe, then the universe no longer exists for anybody or anything at all; it is proved to be an utter illusion, existent phenomenally only so long as the universal conscious- ness admitted it, but capable of coming to an end and therefore shown to be non-existent in its beginning and in its end non- existent. Now our ultimate experience is that there is a last and highest state of consciousness in which the universe does thus cease for the individual to be. What is that state? It is samadhi, a trance of consciousness in which the sole experience is thus expressed, ™I am in bliss∫ and the sole memory brought back is ™I was in bliss.∫ In this state the universe has for the individual no existence; he is released from it. Therefore this highest state of experience is one of which only three things can be afÆrmed, existence, consciousness of existence, bliss of the consciousness of existence; but it is a pure existence without other feature or any relation. But how is this proved to be the ultimate state of our conscious being? Well, it is the knowledge of the sages who have entered into it that it is the ultimate state, it is the knowledge left behind them that they have Ænally passed away into it not to return to consciousness of the phenomenal world, and it is conÆrmed by the authority of the Veda. Reason tells"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Nature: The World-Manifestation 213 us that such a condition must be the ultimate condition, since it is one inÆnitely beyond the phenomenal and to which the phenomenal arrives by self-elimination, and being the ultimate it must be also the original: the phenomenal which disappears from it, must originally have been imposed on it. There is no rational escaping from that conclusion. Well, the individual soul can escape from consciousness of the universe, but what of the universal consciousness? For so long as the universe goes on existing – and who shall say that it is not for all eternity? – this escape may only prove that the individual soul goes into a state of unconsciousness or absorbed self-consciousness, like a man going to sleep or falling into a trance, while the world goes on around him just as before essen- tially unaffected and not at all annulled by his unconsciousness of it. But in the Ærst place this highest power of the individual consciousness cannot be peculiar to it, for it must be a power of the general and universal; the individual reØects the universal, for it is only the law of the universal that can be repeated with individual modiÆcations in the law of the individual. Secondly, the universal soul is the same in all; for that is the experience of the highest knowledge and consciousness, that there [is] one self in all, featureless, immutable, unmodiÆable, the same amidst all the changes of phenomena. As this self can draw back that which supports the individual into it, so it is and must be ca- pable of drawing back that which supports the universal. In one case the stream of phenomena centred around its individual reØection ceases, in the other the stream of phenomena centred around its universal reØection. A theory only? But it is justi- Æed by reason acting on our total experience which sees the lower or phenomenal and the higher or eternal and sees how the phenomenal disappears, vanishes away from the face of the eternal. We have then as a fact a supreme state of existence which is self-existent, the original I am, which is featureless bliss and consciousness of being, immutable, eternal and this seems to be common to all beings, secret in all, the real self of all.

It is a mass of constant modiÆcations of"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"214 Essays Divine and Human consciousness and being, itself in its nature modiÆcation of con- sciousness or of being or of both. It cannot be a modiÆcation of nothing, it must be a modiÆcation of something. If consciousness and being are the Ærst fact, real, eternal, is it not a modiÆcation of conscious being, of this real, this eternal something, and itself therefore real? Is it not itself eternal, an eternal continuity of modiÆcation, uninterrupted continual or else interrupted and recurringly continual? Must we not then suppose two states of the Brahman, a primary state of eternal unmodiÆed being, a secondary state of eternal continuity of modiÆcations of being, becomings of the Brahman? Does not the Vedantic statement that all comes from the Brahman, exists by it, returns to it, imply that all is eternally contained in it and all are modiÆcations of it? In that case, we cannot say that the Eternal Being is absolutely unmodiÆable. No, says the Illusionist, the supreme eternal self is not only unmodiÆed, but unmodiÆable and nothing else but the eternal unmodiÆable self exists really: all else is seeming. How then do all these modiÆcations come about? What is the clue to this mystery, the cause of this magic of illusion? Maya, answers the Illusionist. And what is Maya? It is a power of the eternal consciousness of Brahman by which there comes about an apparent modiÆcation of consciousness of which all these modiÆcations we call the universe are the outcome. The modiÆcation is apparent, not real, yet a fact, unreally, non- existently existent. Maya exists, yet does not exist; and its results too are apparent, not real, yet while Maya lasts, they are a fact we have to deal with, unreally, non-existently existent. We have to escape from them, by escaping from Maya. We do not understand. How can the unmodiÆable consciousness undergo at all even an apparent modiÆcation, to say nothing of such portentous results of the modiÆcation? To that there is no ex- planation, there can be no explanation. It takes place beyond the intellect, before the intellect can at all exist and cannot be understood by the intellect; it must be accepted as a fact; it is a fact that Maya is, it is a fact that Maya can be escaped from, and therefore not being eternal, is transient, is unreal, is not. To see this and escape is our only business. Only while it lasts,"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Nature: The World-Manifestation 215 are we concerned with the modiÆcations. But what is meant by saying while it lasts and who is it that is subject to it and escapes from it? Is it Brahman who is subject to Maya? No, Brahman the eternally unmodiÆable consciousness aware only of the bliss of its self-existence cannot be subject to Maya, does not behold this phenomenal illusion. For if he did, we returning into that, should also behold it and could not by the returning escape from it. It is the individual soul only that is subject to Maya and escapes from it. But who is this individual soul? Is it the self in the individual, the Jivatman, and is the self in the individual different from the eternal Self? No, the individual self is the eternal Brahman, for there is only one self and not many. But then the Jivatman also cannot be subject to Maya or escape from it. There is then nobody subject to it, nobody who escapes. And really that is so, says the illusionist, but what seems to us now to be the individual self, is a reØection of the eternal Self in the mind, and it is that which is subject to Maya and suffers by it. But what then is Mind? It is a result of Maya, it is an illusory movement of consciousness, it is that for which and by which the universe exists. Get rid of its action, its movement, and the illusion will cease; you will be free. But then again who is this you? If I am really the eternal, then I, the individual do not exist; my real self, to use a desperately foolish language, – since that means an individual in possession of a self which cannot be, as my individuality is an illusion, – my real self is in eternal bliss and not being affected cannot care whether this false, nonexistently existent I is bound or escapes, suffers or is in bliss. To whom then does it matter? Only to Maya and mind. Well, then, it is an affair between Maya and mind, and they can settle it between themselves. Precisely, the Illusionist will reply; to you, the mental being, it does matter because you are in Maya, you suffer, however phenomenally, however unreally, and the only way to get rid of it is to abolish Maya by abolishing yourself, your mental individuality, her result by which alone she exists; then you will not exist, Maya and the world will exist for other mental beings; but you will undergo extinction in the Brahman, for you Brahman only will exist. How for me, since I"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"216 Essays Divine and Human can only be either in Maya or out of it, either individually aware of Maya and not of my real self or else non-existent individu- ally? How can `I' be aware of my real self only and of nothing else? It is possible; for as the mind falsely reØects Brahman by Maya as the individual, so free from Maya, it can truly reØect Brahman and it ceases to be individual mind, although in an individual body it still seems to be individually released. Really, it is Brahman expelling Maya from the consciousness, then the mind is taken up into Samadhi, extinguished in Samadhi, and this is the [?prefatory] sign. Fix your mind upon that, look at things practically, and do not ask inconsistent questions, as to how there can be individual salvation when there is no individual self to be saved. These questions do not arise once the release is made, they arise in Maya which is a practical fact and can receive only a practical solution. Well that is a kind of answer. But how am I to know that it is not an evasion of the difÆculty? What if I say that really the unmodiÆable Brahman is not the highest truth? that the Brahman is aware at once of his unmodiÆed eternal self and of his eternally modiÆed cosmic existence, Akshara and Kshara, but he is himself beyond both, and that my real way of escape is to be the same, to be aware of my eternal self and of all the universe as modiÆcations of my self; that with this transcendence and universality comes perfect bliss, and that the fact that I, still existing in Maya, can be blissfully aware of one Self everywhere and of all things in the universe is a proof of my assertion? This seems to me at least as good a theory as your theory of Maya; and if you say, how is that possible, I can either allege reasons or answer like you, it is a supraintellectual fact and we have to take it as a fact and Ænd the practical way of realising it. If you want me to reject it in favour of your theory, give me at least some help. Make me realise how the world can be nonexistently existent, how the unmodiÆable can be apparently modiÆed, how I can exist only beyond the world and yet exist in it so palpably that I must struggle to get out of it, how Brahman exists only beyond Maya and yet by me exists in Maya, how mind is the result of Maya, an instrument to see world and is"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Nature: The World-Manifestation 217 yet capable of getting rid of Maya and seeing only the Brahman, how being by my individuality subject to Maya, and only able to escape by getting rid of my individuality, I am yet to become individually aware of Brahman and get an individual salvation, while all the rest of the world by which alone I am individual in my experience is still subject to it, how an unreal individual can realise Brahman. The Mayavadin answers that as it is the Maya power of the Self which creates the ignorance in each individual, so it is the Self in each individual which enables him to have the knowledge by removing from him the Maya power. How this can be, can only be explained by analogies. As a man mistakes a rope for a snake, and then discovers it is a rope and there is no snake, so the mind thinks there is a world where there is only Brahman and discovers in the end that there is only Brahman; – or as a man mistakes mother of pearl for real pearl and runs after it and is then disillusioned and leaves it to go after the reality. As a pot is only a name and form of earth and earth is the only reality, so the world and the individual are only a name and form; break the pot, it will go back to its original earth; break the name and form in the consciousness, get rid of the individual, and there will be only Brahman in the consciousness. There are many golden ornaments, but the reality of them all is the gold; it is that alone which has value. So Brahman only is worth having; the rest is name and form and mere vanity. Or if these analogies seem to be only physical images not valid for a supraphysical fact, observe how you dream. The dream has no reality, yet is real to your consciousness while it lasts. The you in the dream is an unreal you; you awake to your real self. So the world is a dream; falling asleep to the world, the dream ceases; awake to the Brahman, the dream is convinced of unreality. That is the only possible and a quite sufÆcient answer. Is it a sufÆcient answer? Does it prove the main point that the world consciousness is an apparent and unreal modiÆcation of the ever unmodiÆable Brahman and therefore to be dispelled as quickly as possible, so that I may cease to exist, except insofar as I already eternally exist, not at all as I, but as the Brahman?"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"218 Essays Divine and Human Above all, does it show that my one practical business is to get rid of a world consciousness which is of no value and has no purpose except self-bewilderment, and become again what I ought never to have ceased to be in my unreal consciousness, as indeed I am still that in my real consciousness, the featureless and immutable Spirit? Is the world really a valueless dream, a purposeless delirium of ignorance? Have we no other true spiritual business here except to get out of it? These are the real questions that the soul of man asks of the illusionist thinker, and we have to judge his answer. 43 Existence is not a Øuke, a random creation by nobody, a thing that unaccountably happened to be. It carries in itself the Word of God, it is full of a hidden Divine Presence. Existence is not a blind machine that somehow came and started a set ignoble motion without object or sense or purpose. Existence is a Truth of things unfolding by a gradual process of manifestation, an evolution of its own involved Reality. Existence is not an illusion, a Maya that had no reason, no business to exist, could not exist, does not exist but only seems to be. A mighty Reality manifests in itself this marvellous universe. 44 All that is is the manifestation of a Divine InÆnite. The universe has no other reason for existence. There is an eternal manifestation and there is a temporal manifestation; both are without end or beginning even as That which manifests is without end or beginning.

Since evolution or a gradual self-unfolding is the essential movement of the universe, the impulse of all life in the universe must be to self-fulÆlment and the realisation of its utmost po- tentialities. Behind each form of life there is a divine idea which determines its form and its limits and the form circumscribes the potentialities of the life. Therefore the self-fulÆlment of the life is contained within certain limits Æxed by the nature of the life and the law of its being and action which that nature determines. The idea which thus determines is the cause and the form which thus limits the sign of the Finite in the universe. The universe is an inÆnity creating innumerable Ænite expressions of itself in idea and form within its own inÆnite being. The one and inÆnite is the soul and reality of each Ænite; the multiple Ænite is the rhythm, movement and harmony of the inÆnite. Therefore in and behind all Ænite life in the universe there is an inÆnite reality seeking to arrive at itself which must in its self-unfolding create Ænite forms of life which are yet able in their consciousness and movement to manifest and realise the inÆnite.

To the Cosmic Spirit which sees things as a whole, the working out of this universe or any universe is self-justiÆed, the obscure labour of the emergence no less than the glory of its comple- tion and Ænal perfection in a yet unattained light, bliss and greatness. At any rate into this world of evolution something of the eternal spirit has thrown itself, with all in it that consented to the descent and to fulÆl the world, not to escape from it, is the deepest meaning of the Spirit and Godhead within us and the universe.

He is too im- perfect for that, too imperfect in capacity for knowledge, too imperfect in will and action, too imperfect in his turn towards joy and beauty, too imperfect in his will for freedom and his instinct for order. Even if he could perfect himself in his own type, his type is too low and small to satisfy the need of the universe. Something larger, higher, more capable of a rich all embracing universality is needed, a greater being, a greater consciousness summing up in itself all that the world set out to be. He has, as was pointed out by a half blind seer, to exceed himself; man must evolve out of himself the divine superman: he was born for transcendence. Humanity is not enough, it is only a strong stepping stone; the need of the world is a superhuman perfection of what the world can be, the goal of consciousness is divinity. The inmost need of man is not to perfect his humanity, but to be greater than himself, to be more than man, to be divine, even to be the Divine. To rest in humanity is to rest in imperfection; the perfect man would be a self-contented Ænality of incompleteness. His nature is transitional and there is therefore in it an innate tendency to strive towards something more. – Unless indeed he turned aside from his destiny, became a two-legged termite content with a perfectly arranged or sufÆ- ciently comfortable material order. He would [... ...]exist, deteriorate or become stable like the ant or the dung-beetle or after attaining complete efÆciency, disappear like the sloth, the mammoth, the pterodactyl or the dinosaur.

Consciousness then is a circumstance of body and incapable of survival of the body. There is no such thing per se as consciousness. A consciousness not dependent on the body, expressing itself in it as its instrument, a soul or spirit, is therefore a myth, an imagination; if it existed, it would be an unwarrantable intrusion into the nature of things as seen in this material universe; or, since everything in this universe is dependent on Matter, arose from Matter, is a circumstance or result of Matter and returns to Matter, soul too would be a circumstance or result of Matter, would act by it and in it only, would return Ænally to Matter. Consciousness itself is a phenomenon of Matter, is nothing but Matter in action, a com- bination of phenomenal action of chemical or other physical entities and operations and can be nothing else. It is unproven and unprovable, – though it may be that it is also not disproved and not disprovable. Either it must be left in a barren light or no light of agnosticism or is at most a matter of faith and not of knowledge.

If human consciousness had been something complete, consummate, a ne plus ultra, then we could conÆdently say that here was the summit, here the crown and end of things and beings, here the perfected creation and the supreme terrestrial creator. Or if his consciousness though imperfect showed signs that it could arrive [at] the very top of possibility, rule earth and discover heaven, then we might believe that man was the last instrument by which Nature was passing from the terrestrial to the highest stage developing out of her initial inconscience a supreme conscient being. But man seems to be by his very mould of nature a being with an animal living out of which he grew and a mental boundary beyond which he cannot pass. For mind is the man, mind cramped into a body and en- tangled in the intricate machinery of a laborious and precarious physical organism which helps it less than it hampers. Mind's only data for knowledge are the motions of terrestrial life, the motions and processes of the physical world and its own pro- cesses and motions. Its notions about other things are merely speculations, guesses, imaginations; it thinks about them by means of abstractions, it cannot grasp anything concrete.

It discovers by analysis or makes a synthesis by Ætting together the fragments of things. Eventually it discovers the phenomenon, but misses the reality; it knows things as objects but knows nothing about things in themselves. Reality is beyond its grasp, it is only sure about the appearance. This is much for one who emerged out of nescient Matter and started as the ignorant animal, but it is not enough to make of man the crown of creation and the last apex of the evolution. If man's knowledge and his way of knowledge are imper- fect, still more imperfect are his living and his doing. [His] works sometimes attain perfection. Some men have done well in poetry and the arts and crafts, more have done badly, most are conventional copyists or botchers. In science and works with a scientiÆc basis, men have certainly done well and their works were often efÆcient or masterly, for there all is method and rule and there the human mind seeks to master and execute what he has to do and that he can always do. Few have insight in works, fewer have any originality. Journeyman's work he can do, for man is essentially a jour- neyman. He is skilful in putting things [up], buildings, a job, a swindle. In pulling down he is perfect, a destroyer ne plus ultra. The world is full of his constructions, but more per- vasive is his destruction; but that leaves few traces.

The secret of consciousness reveals itself only when we perceive these two limits and the movement between them which we call the universe. There can be no consciousness without existence, for the consciousness of a Void or a Nihil is a vain imagination, a thing impossible. For Nothing cannot be conscious of any- thing – cannot be conscious of itself; if it were conscious of itself, it would at once be an existence aware of itself, it would cease to be a Nihil; it would at once be evident that it was all the time an Existence appearing to be Nihil, that it was Being or a Being unconscious, but now grown conscious of its own existence. A void conscious of itself is conceivable, but it would then be a void existence and not Nihil. There might be an eternal Non-Being, but that too could not be Nihil; eventually it could only be a supreme superconscient existence exceeding our notion of Being. A true Nihil would necessarily be as incapable of conscious- ness as of existence; out of it nothing could come as in it nothing could be, neither spirit nor soul nor mind nor Matter. We have then at one end of things a supreme supercon- scient existence and [at the other] a supreme inconscient exis- tence and between them we have consciousness in the universe; but both are two states of one Being; what is between also is movement of that one Being between its two ends, its two highest and lowest levels of self-manifestation.

What was involved evolves slowly; each manifested term of the evolution is a step in the series and presupposes another step beyond it. There can be no Ænality until a perfect potential is reached which can express all the possibilities of the involved Godhead.

There is a secret self-compulsion in the Inconscient to man- ifest what is involved – gaoled, suppressed and inactive within it, but also there is a stupendous Inertia, as of some fathomless cosmic sleep, that resists the will to manifest and retards the evolution. There is thus an upward levitation towards the lumi- nous eternity of the Spirit strongly countered by a downward gravitation back towards the Inconscience. This Inertia was needed in order that the evolution might be gradual by aeonic process and not an explosion of the concealed elements either into a rapid self-ordered typal series or into their original superconscience. As a consequence of this retarding force what is involved evolves with difÆculty and slowly. Evolution is a struggle be- tween an insistent call to manifestation and an iron retardatory reluctant Inertia. Evolutionary existence is precarious because the downward gravitation back to its source contradicts pow- erfully both the stress from within towards permanence and the pull from above towards self-transcendence. Matter in our world can easily dissolve into its elements, life sink back into death, mind relapse into unconsciousness. A type evolved, an- imal or man, struggles slowly and with much difÆculty into manifestation, it is less difÆcult for it to disappear, as disap- peared the mastodon and the dinosaurus. Hence the law of a precarious impermanence laid on the forms of Matter which is corrected only for a time by the lavish will to reproduction in Nature.

There is a will or at least an urge in the Inconscient itself, slow, dumb, obscure but imperative and inevitable towards the revelation of its involved contents. But there is also a pressure from above from the already estab- lished Powers for their manifestation in Space-Time here and for their evolutionary possibilities in the world of Matter. A world of subtle Matter presses on the shapeless Inconscient for the manifestation of forms; a world of essential Life presses on form of Matter for the manifestation of an embodied life; a world of essential Mind presses on animate life for the manifes- tation of mind in the living body. This compulsion is so great as to contradict and counteract Ænally the refusing and retarding Inertia. Above on the summits of existence is all that is beyond Mind and all that is the complete splendour of the Spirit. These too wait for their hour of manifestation, their turn for revelation in Time and Space and the evolving series of the powers of the Eternal. 57 All existence upon earth is an evolution of what has come down from a superconscious Eternity to be involved here in a subconscious InÆnite. The superconscious Eternity to which we tend and the sub- conscious InÆnite from which we rise – for we are a part of both and we stand between them as their developing link – are opposite powers of the same Being, are indeed, in their essence, one and the same Being; but one appears to our experience as a dark and void shadow of the other.

What comes down from the Superconscient is self, spirit, the wide and all-containing Essence of the eternal existence. It plunges, carrying its powers in it, into an inÆnite ocean of inconscience, apraketam salilam , and hides itself there. It hides itself and its powers from itself – it appears in us as its own opposite. The Self is an immortal and unseizable essence and sub- stance of all things, it is a pure omnipresent omniscient omnipo- tent existence. It appears to our experience when we emerge from the subconscient as a mysterious Void or Nihil, indeter- minable yet from it all things and forms are, inconscient yet Øowering into consciousness, inert yet manifesting enormous energies, lifeless yet the parent of life, insensible yet a fountain of pain and pleasure. This impossibility, this universal contra- diction is unreal and born of our ignorance; yet that ignorance is not ours, but a result of the inconscience which was imposed on itself as a veil by the involved Self and Spirit. For if that Inconscience were not there, the evolutionary emergence of the Self which is the law and object of this universe would not have been possible; all would have Øowered into a manifestation too immediate, too irresistibly powerful in its process, too absolute. The Self, the Spirit is a pure existence, a spiritual substance that is self-aware and therefore all-aware. It is in its nature an ab- solute and omniscient consciousness, eternally comprehending all itself, all in itself and would naturally manifest as an absolute, unwalled, indivisible knowledge. It becomes an inconscience out of which consciousness struggles brokenly into light, seeking and groping for itself, groping after signs and intimations of its sub- stance, but Ænding at Ærst only fragmentary signs and separated forms and objects which seem not itself.

It becomes aware of itself as a separated form and only when it grows more and more deeply self-conscious slowly becomes aware of all outside"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"240 Essays Divine and Human it as part of its own continuous indivisible existence. The nature of the Spirit's consciousness is a self-existent Force which in action becomes a spontaneously self-manifesting or, as it seems to us, self-creating and self-determining energy. It is omnisciently omnipotent and creates out of itself what it wills under whatever conditions it wills – for its will is that of an inÆnite and inÆnitely variable self-aware oneness whose steps, no matter what they are, are by necessity the movement of a perfect Truth and Knowledge. But it is by an equal necessity the very opposite when the manifestation of the Substance of things be- comes the working of a void Inconscience. For even if that Incon- science be only apparent because an all-knowledge and its force are hidden there, yet this error, this phenomenon of Inconscience is and was intended to be dynamic and operative. In other words, all had to look and appear as the gropings of an Inconscience whose results in their upshot were yet those of an ordered and imperative Intelligence. An inert Soul guiding with a strange and blind sureness the steps of a somnambulist Nature would be no inadequate image of the apparent Spirit of this material universe. This material world sprung from the subconscious InÆnite appears to us as if [it] were the sole actual universe and even perhaps the only creation possible. But that is because we are limited by our senses which we now know to be restricted in their Æeld and even there fallible. The material senses by their very nature can perceive only material things and from that our still infantile external reason infers that only material things exist and there is nothing else. All forms that are immaterial or of another substance than ours are and cannot but be il- lusions, hallucinations, unreal images. But a being otherwise constituted in consciousness or sense could well see this world in other Ægures than present themselves to ours. Another would see perhaps other worlds made of another, a subtler material or an essentially mental or vital or spiritual substance.

We shall understand nothing of existence if we conÆne our vision to the particular view of things our primary consciousness and its instruments which are physical impose upon us; for this consciousness is only a surface phenomenon of ourselves and our total being is far deeper, higher and vaster than that, our possibilities extend inÆnitely beyond their present limit, and the world also is far more complex than the Ærst crude inexplicable mystery of Matter would lead us to imagine. The immense material world in which we live is not the sole reality but only one of innumerable potential and existent uni- verses; all of them need not have either Matter as we know it or the Inconscient for their base. Indeed this world of matter is itself dependent on many planes of consciousness and existence which are not material; for these have not this gross substance as their foundation or as the medium of their instrumentation of energy and consciousness or their primary condition of existence. All the powers that are involved here in the inconscient InÆnite and that we see rising out of it, – mind, life and what is beyond mind no less than matter itself – have their previous existence and are not merely evolutionary results of Nature in this universe. They have not only a preexistence but also their separate planes of manifestation in which each in turn is, as matter is here, the foundation, the medium of instrumentation, the primary condition of existence. 58 All terrestrial existence is the slow surge of a hidden Conscious- ness mounting up out of an apparent Inconscience towards its own perfect and luminous manifestation. This is the secret of evolution and its signiÆcance. 4 There is a spirit secret even in things immobile, – there is an All-Consciousness disguised in the Inconscient. In Matter life 4 Sri Aurobindo left out the sentence that follows when he revised the first draft of this piece: All else is only veils and means and forms, conditions and stages, action and counter- action of this great half-veiled becoming which is the heart of the earth's enigma."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"242 Essays Divine and Human is embedded, in Life is an enveloped mind, in Mind is concealed a greater supramental and spiritual being not yet manifested. These are the signiÆcant and illumining terms of the riddle. Evolution is the labour of Nature, or let us say at once of the Energy of the secret Spirit, working in the semblance and under the limiting conditions of an inconscient Power to release these latencies each in its turn out of their involution in the original Inconscience. It is an All-consciousness that is working, the force of a self- aware cosmic Spirit, and the emergence of its secret powers is implied in the very nature of existence; therefore the result is inevitable. Science has discovered a physical evolution hidden in the past history of the earth of which the living record remains in the embryo; but the physical evolution is only an outward sign, means and material condition of a still more secret evolution. A spiritual evolution, an evolution of consciousness is the inner fact which alone illumines the problem of earth existence and opens to it its true solution; apart from it our life here has no intelligible signiÆcance. Ancient Indian thought discovered an evolution from birth to birth, from the life of tree and plant to the life of insect and animal, from the life of the animal to the life of man, attained with difÆculty through the ages. This slowly attained human life it took to be the key of release from the bafØing circle of the enigma. After some eighty and more lakhs of births, says the Tantra, a soul reaches the human form and consciousness and sooner or later Ænds the secret of escape from birth in time into the birthless and deathless Eternity from which it came. These two discoveries seem at Ærst sight quite unconnected and disparate. In one it is a physical Life in the cosmos that evolves and the individual is only an ephemeral member of the species, the species a means of this cosmic evolution.

In man it has shot its bolt; nothing more is possible. Consciousness emerging out of the Inconscient has achieved this shoddy and splendid, this winging and limping miracle of the ever-seeking creative Mind of Man and sinks back into the Inconscient; its emergence had no discoverable signiÆcance, its brief play and cessation make no difference to the meaningless rounds of an inconscient universe. In the Indian view it is the individual that evolves from birth to birth and the hierarchy of the vegetal, animal, human kinds [is] a Æxed unchanging ladder for its ascent. A successive creation of higher and higher species is envisaged in the Upani- shads as well as the Puranas and heredity afÆrmed as a means of conscious continuity of the human embodiment of the Spirit, but still the evolution is individual and not cosmic, spiritual not physical. Yet here too this persistent phenomenon of spiritual embodiment appearing from the bodiless Spirit and evolving back into the bodiless Spirit seems to be devoid of signiÆcance. If stripped of their limitations the two discoveries can be regarded as complementary rather than disparate. There is evi- dently an evolution; Matter Ærst manifests out of the Formless – inanimate in appearance; in Matter life manifests unconscious in appearance; in life mind manifests in the animal but instinctive and irrational in appearance; in life-mind thinking mind appears rational but yet self-ignorant in appearance, – for it seeks to know but yet does not know the secret and signiÆcance of its own existence. It is not yet undisputed but it is afÆrmed that in thinking man spirit is moving towards manifestation, spirit aware of itself and of its own secret and signiÆcance. Thus far at least an evolution is indisputable and we may afÆrm with- out hesitation that there is a cosmic Existence here which Ærst achieves a material manifestation of itself or a manifestation in itself, a material formula, then on that basis a life formulation, a vital formula, on that again a mental formulation, a mind for- mula. It is possible that on that again it is preparing a spiritual formulation of self-afÆrmation and self-knowledge which will complete the emergence. There is also very evidently an evolution of forms, generic"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"244 Essays Divine and Human and individual in the genus and species, which enables the for- mulation to be effective, each in its own kind, organised so as to express more and more deÆnite and superior possibilities of matter, more and more deÆnite and superior possibilities of life, more and more deÆnite and superior possibilities of mind, – more than this cannot yet be positively asserted, but this much is asseverable. If we can add that in the mental formula, in the mentalised life and body of man, a spiritual emergence is in process which has not yet reached its full possibility and that possibility is the emergence of the spiritual man or supramental being, then the object of the physical evolution and its signif- icance becomes clear. The evolution of bodies is only a means for the evolution of consciousness and the spiritual formulation will be that in which the cosmic Existence will Ænd its own full afÆrmation, manifest through the original veil of Matter its self- awareness, self-knowledge, self-realisation. The Cosmic Spirit hidden in the Inconscience is then the Alpha, its manifestation in the consciousness of spiritualised man the Omega.

It has brought out from its apparent inconscience only the three powers of Mind and Life and Matter. 60 Matter, one might say from a certain viewpoint, is purely a matter of mathematics.

Perishable and transitory delight is always the symbol of the eternal Ananda, revealed and rapidly concealed, which seeks by increasing recurrence to attach itself to some typal form of experience in material consciousness. When the particular form has been perfected to express God in the type, its delight will no longer be perishable but an eternally recurrent possession of mental beings in matter manifest in their periods & often in their moments of felicity. 63 Evolution is the one eternal dynamic law and hidden process of the earth-nature. An evolution of the instruments of the spirit in a medium of matter is the whole fundamental signiÆcance of the values of the earth-existence. All its other laws are its values of operation and process; the spiritual evolution is its one pervading secret sense. * The history of the earth is Ærst an evolution of organised forms by the working of material forces. There follows on this initial stage an evolution of life in the form and an organisation of a hierarchy of living forms by the working of liberated life-forces.

Below us there are lower ranges to which we are insensible and these we call subconscience or inconscience. Above us are higher ranges which are to our inferior nature an unseizable superconscience. The difÆculty of Matter is not an absolute inconscience but an obscured consciousness limited by its own movement, vaguely, dumbly, blindly self-aware, only mechanically respon- sive to anything outside its own form and force. At its worst it can be called not so much inconscience as nescience. The awakening of a greater and yet greater consciousness in this Nescience is the miracle of the universe of Matter. This nescience of Matter is a veiled, an involved or a som- nambulist consciousness which contains all the latent powers of the Spirit. In every particle, atom, molecule, cell of Matter there lives hidden and works unknown all the omniscience of the Eternal and all the omnipotence of the InÆnite. The evolution of forms and powers by which Matter will become more and more conscious until passing beyond form and life and mind it becomes aware with the supernal awareness of the eternal and inÆnite Spirit in his own highest ranges, this is the meaning of earth existence. The slow self-manifesting birth of God in Matter is the purpose of the terrestrial Lila. ** Matter is at once a force and a substance.

When that has been done, the physical world is ready for the splendid intrusion of conscious Life into the force-driven inertia of material substance. Matter is not the only force, nor the only substance. For Life and Mind too and what is beyond Mind are also forces that are substances but of another kind and degree. Spirit is the original force-substance; all these others are kinds and derivations of force of spirit, degrees and modiÆca- tions [of] substance of spirit. Matter too is nothing but a power and degree of the spirit; Matter too is substance of the Eternal. But the Matter that we see and sense is only an outermost sheath and coating; behind it are other subtler degrees of physi- cal substance which are less dense with the atomic nescience and it is easier for Life and Mind to enter into them and operate. If Æner invisible physical layers or couches did not exist supporting this gross visible physical world, that world could not abide; for then the Æne operations of transmission between Spirit and Matter [could not] be executed at all and it is these that render the grosser visible operations possible. The evolution would be impossible; life and mind and beyond-mind would be unable to manifest in the material universe. There is not only this material plane of being that we see, there is a physical life plane proper to the vital physical operation of Nature. There is a physical mind plane proper to a mental physical operation of Nature. There is a physical supermind plane proper to the supramental physical operation of Nature.

It is higher planes that Øood the constantly unfolding unseen energies which have raised its evolution from the obscurity in which it began to the splendour of a light of consciousness to which the highest human mind shall only be the feeble glimmer of a glowworm Ære before the sun in its Øaming glories. There is a stupendous hierarchy of grades of consciousness between darkest Matter and most luminous spirit. Conscious- ness in Matter has to go on climbing to the very top of the series and return with all it has to give us before the evolution can utterly fulÆl its purpose. ** Matter, Life, Mind, Supermind or Gnosis, and beyond these the quadruple power of a supreme Being-Consciousness-Force- Bliss – these are the grades of the evolutionary ascent from inconscience to the Superconscience.

But, imprisoned in the apparent inanimate inertia or blind force movement of Matter, it is bound by its movements and unable to manifest its own independent or dominant existence. Life is there in the earth, rock, metal, gas, atom, electron and the other more subtle yet undiscovered forces and particles that constitute material energy and form.

But above the material world there is a plane of dominant Life that presses down upon this material universe and seeks to pour into it whatever it can of its own types, powers, forces, impulsions, manifesting creative godheads. When in the material world form is ready, the Gods and Life-Daemons of this higher plane are attracted to put their creative touch upon Matter. Then there comes a rapid and sudden efØorescence of Life; the plant, the animalcule, the insect, the animal appear. A Life-Soul and a Life-Force with its many and always more complex movements are manifested in what seemed once to be inert and inanimate substance. Life souls, life minds, animal existences are born and evolve; a new world appears that is born and contained in this world of Matter and yet surpasses it in its own dynamic nature. 64 At each capital step of Nature's ascent there is a reversal of consciousness in the evolving spirit. As when a climber turns on a summit to which he has laboured and looks down with an exalted and wider power of vision on all that was once above or on a level with him but is now below his feet, the evolutionary being not only transcends his past self, his former now exceeded status, but commands from a higher grade of self-experience and vision, with a new apprehending feeling or a new comprehend- ing sight and effectuating power, in a greater system of values, all that was once his own consciousness but is now below his tops and belongs to an inferior creation. This reversal is the sign of a decisive victory and the seal of a radical progress in Nature. The new consciousness attained in the spiritual evolution is always higher in grade and power, always larger, more com- prehensive, wider in sight and feeling, richer and Æner in facul- ties, more complex, organic, dominating than the consciousness that was once our own but is now left behind us.

There is a miraculous opening to an always richer and wider expression, there is a new illuminating of the creation and a dynamic heightening of its signiÆcances. There is in this world we live in no equality of all on a Øat level, but a hierarchy of ever-increasing precipitous superiorities pushing their mountain- shoulders upwards towards the Supreme. Plant-life is a most signiÆcant progress upon the mineral, but the difference is as nothing compared with the gulf that divides the dumb vitality of the plant from the conscious experience of the animal. The hiatus between the animal and the human is so great in consciousness, however physically small, that the scientists' alleged cousinship of monkey and man looks psychologically almost incredible. And yet the difference between vital animal and mental man is as nothing to that which will be between man's mind and the superman's vaster consciousness and richer powers. That past step will be to this new one as the snail's slow march in the grass to a Titan's sudden thousand league stride from continent to continent. Evolution on the terrestrial plane, even in the dullest brute matter is only in outward appearance a progression of physical function and form; in its essential fact, in its inner meaning, in its signiÆcant power, it is a progression of consciousness, a spiritual or psychological change.

Mental or psychic powers and signiÆcances there are, as an occult knowledge discovers, but of these the form seems not aware; it is something behind the life of the mineral, a consciousness supporting rather than inhabiting it, using but not used by it, that is their possessor. In the plant world for the Ærst time a true vital consciousness appears in earth Nature. 65 All the trend and purpose of Nature in terrestrial existence is to manifest the yet unmanifested. Her continual aim is to develop out of what has been evolved that which has not been evolved but is waiting to [be] liberated out of latency. This continual evolution is the whole meaning of terrestrial existence. What has already been evolved is form of matter with life and mind housed in it, what has yet to be evolved is supermind liberating from their narrow limits and transforming mind and life and matter. Here on earth and in the material universe matter has been the Ærst term, the basis of things, the condition of all that must evolve here. Life can evolve here only so far as it can persuade or compel matter to give it a form and an instrumentation. Mind too has to accommodate itself to the means given it by an organ- ised living body. There is no reason to suppose however that life in itself is limited in its possibilities to the small range realised by the living animal or human body; or the potentialities [of] mind limited to the Æeld of powers accorded to it by the brain, nerves and physical senses, its ingenious but still very poor and unreliable instruments here."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Man and Superman 253 In a world where life and not matter was the Ærst term, condition and basis, in a vital world life would be free to or- ganise itself in its own way with a free energy in plastic and pliable forms and its ranges of possibilities would be immense and circumscribed by no rigid limits. 66 But what shall be the gain won for the earth-consciousness we embody by this unprecedented ascent out of mind to whatever may be beyond it and what the signiÆcance of the supramental change? To what end shall man leave his safe human limits for this godlike but hazardous adventure? First consider what was gained when earthly Nature passed from the brute inconscience and inertia of the Ærst organised forms in what seems to us inanimate Matter to the vibrant sensibility of the plant range. Life was gained; the gain was the beginning of the mute groping and involved consciousness that reaches out to growth, to sense-vibration, to waking and sleep, to hunger and thirst, to physical pain and pleasure, to a prepa- ration for vital yearnings and a living joy and beauty. That was begun which still is unÆnished – the Ærst step towards a con- scious consciousness and what shall yet be the divine Ananda. 6 In the plant earth-nature achieved a Ærst Ægure of life, but the creature she made could not possess it, because this Ærst organised life-consciousness had feeling and seeking, woke and slept, hungered and was satisÆed, thirsted and drank and grew and Øourished, had pleasure of some contacts and suffered from others, but was still externally blind, dumb, deaf, chained to the soil from which it was born, involved in its own nerve and tissue.

This was a decisive but an imprisoned gain; for there was still a gross oppression of the original Inconscience which had covered up with the brute phenomenon of Matter and energy of Matter all signs of the Spirit. Nature could no- wise stop here, because she held so much in her that was still occult, potential, unexpressed, unorganised, suppressed, latent; the evolution had perforce to go farther. The animal had to replace the plant at the head and top of Nature. And what then was gained when Nature passed from the ob- scurity of the plant kingdom to the awakened sense and desire and emotion and the free mobility of animal life? The gain was liberated sense and feeling and desire and courage and cunning and the contrivance of the objects of desire, passion and action and hunger and battle and conquest and the sex-call and play and pleasure, and all the joy and pain of the conscious living creature. Not only the life of the body which the animal has in common with the plant but a life-mind that appeared for the Ærst time in the earth-story and grew and grew from form to more organised form till it reached in the best the limit of its own formula. The animal achieved a Ærst form of mind, but could not possess it, because this Ærst organised mind consciousness was enslaved in a narrow scope, tied to the Ærst functionings of the physical body and brain and nerve, tied to serve the physical life and its desires and needs and passions, limited to the insistent uses of the vital urge, to natural longing and feeling and action, bound by its own inferior instrumentation, its spontaneous com- binings of association and memory and instinct. It could not get away from them, could not get behind them as man's intelligence gets behind them to observe them; still less could it turn down on them from above as do human reason and will to control, enlarge, reorder, exceed, sublimate. 67 Mind emerges out of life in matter; it is incapable of manifesting"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Man and Superman 255 directly in the material form. It is there, but it acts mechanically in the somnambulism of an original force of inconscience and inertia. This and no more is what we mean by the inconscience of Matter; for although consciousness is there, it is involved, inorganic, mechanical in its action; it supports the works of Force by its inherent presence, but not by its light of active intelligence. This is why material Nature does the works of a supreme and miraculous intelligence and yet there seems to be no intervention of any indwelling Seer or Thinker. 68 Because man is a mental being, he naturally imagines that mind is the one great leader and actor and creator or the indispensable agent in the universe. But this is an error; even for knowledge mind is not the only or the greatest possible instrument, the one aspirant and discoverer. Mind is a clumsy interlude between Nature's vast and precise subconscient action and the vaster infallible superconscient action of the Godhead. There is nothing mind can do that cannot be better done in the mind's immobility and thought-free stillness. When mind is still, then Truth gets her chance to be heard in the purity of the silence. Truth cannot be attained by the mind's thought but only by identity and silent vision. Truth lives in the calm wordless Light of the eternal spaces; she does not intervene in the noise and cackle of logical debate. Thought in the mind can at most be Truth's brilliant and transparent garment; it is not even her body. Look through the robe, not at it, and you may see some hint of her form. There can be a thought-body of Truth, but that is the spontaneous supramental Thought and Word that leap fully formed out of the Light, not any difÆcult mental counterfeit and patchwork. The supramental Thought is not a means of arriving at Truth, for Truth in the supermind is self-found or self-existent, but a way of expressing her.

But only if the mind is no less intense in its purity than its silence. For in an impure mind the silence will soon Æll with misleading lights and false voices, the echo or sublimation of its own vain conceits and opinions or the response to its secret pride, vanity, ambition, lust, greed or desire. The Titans and the Demons will speak to it more readily than the divine Voices. Silence is indispensable, but also there is needed wideness. If the mind is not silent, it cannot receive the lights and voices of the supernal Truth or receiving mixes with them its own Øickering tongues and blind pretentious babble. Active, arrogant, noisy, it distorts and disÆgures what it receives. If it is not wide, it cannot house the effective power and creative force of the Truth. Some light may play there but it becomes narrow, conÆned and sterile. Or the force that is descending is cabined and thwarted and withdraws again from this rebellious foreign plane to its vast native heights.

These are the queries it is proposed to answer here; but the answer can come only from intuition itself, from a direct seeing and experience, for if intuition exists, it and its way of working must obviously be something beyond the reasoning intelligence and therefore not entirely seizable by the reasoning intelligence. I know myself because I am myself, I know the movements of my mind, joy, anger, love, thought, will, because they are myself or parts of myself; I have a direct knowledge of myself, a knowledge by identity. Observation, reasoning there can be as a subsidiary process; but it is not by observation or reasoning that I know them; I feel and know my anger or love as part of myself and have no need to observe or to reason in order to know that I am angry or that I love. Intuition is a direct knowledge self-existent and independent of means and devices; it is naturally self-existent and founded upon a knowledge by identity; or when it is gained, it is either by identiÆcation or by a knowledge arising from some intimate contact made possible by an underlying or occult identity. 73 Nothing has the value of truth for the supramental if it is only thought or understood with the intelligence. That is a shadow or reØection and shadows can always distort, at best only adum- brate; reØections can always misform or mistranslate and at best have not the truth-substance. It is only when the object is entered into, seen with an inner and surrounding vision, possessed in experience, taken into our living universal & identifying indi- vidual consciousness, made one with us in the Truth that is, holds, comprehends, actuates all things, – only then is there the characteristic process of the supermind, the way of directness, the sincerity and power, the magniÆcence and general wholeness of the gnosis[.]"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Man and Superman 259 74 But what is supermind and where is it in this world of half lights, in which consciousness is a constructor of ideas, images and sensations that at once inform and mislead, representations that are half truths, half misrepresentations, symbols of things, not things in themselves, relative impressions but nothing absolute. Our senses give us the forms of things as they seem to our senses, not as they are; for they would appear quite different to other senses than ours; our mind builds the great mass of its idea of the world and things on this insecure basis, or if it corrects the evidence of the senses, it is in the light of a reason whose conceptions of Time, Space and Substance are equally imperfect, equally relative, empirically valid up to a certain point, but fundamentally dubious and insecure.

This is very clear from the incompleteness and imperfection of all his powers of consciousness; he can only arrive at some limited form of tempo- rary and unstable perfection by much labour and struggle; and yet the search for perfection is ingrained in his nature. There is something that he is not yet which he has to be; he is reaching always towards the something yet unrealised; his whole life and nature is a preparation, an endeavour of Nature towards what is beyond him. The human consciousness is limited in every direction; it does not know itself, it does not know the world around it, it does not know the origin and meaning and use of its existence."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"266 Essays Divine and Human But it strives always to know, to Ænd the truth of its being, the right use of its life, the end towards which Nature in him is tending; this it does with a seeking and blundering movement; man's consciousness is an ignorance struggling towards knowl- edge; it is a weakness training itself for power; it is a thing of pleasure and suffering that tries to lay hands on the true delight of existence. All that we see in us and around us in this material world is a mystery-play of the Eternal and InÆnite; it is the large total and the curiously variable detail of steps and circumstances in a self-discovery or self-unfolding of a Divinity who has hidden his real from his manifested self in the vast black disguise of the inconscience of Nature. This is the constant miracle that is the key to the meaning of existence, – the miracle of the birth and growth of life and con- sciousness in the inanimation and inconscience of the material universe. The birth and growth of consciousness is the whole sense of evolution. For evolution is not in its inner and essential character a development of more and more organised forms of Matter. This development is only an outer instrumentation for the evo- lution of life and of consciousness in life. That again in its deepest inmost sense is a growth embodying the slow self-discovery and self-revelation of a soul or spirit in a form of living matter. The evolution has been an ascension starting from forms that seem to be inanimate and inconscient objects, for in them the spirit in things is asleep, through a leisurely waking in plant and animal till it reached with difÆculty a beginning of self- awareness in man the mental being, the Ærst and only speaking, thinking, reasoning creature. But there is no ground for the idea cherished by this imperfect human being that he is the summit and last word of the evolution. Humanity is one step in the des- tiny of the evolving spirit, the last before it assumes something of its own divinity delivered and apparent; his imperfect life and consciousness must develop itself into the type of the fully con- scious being, after man or out of him must be born the superman."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Man and Superman 267 This consummation can only take place by an evolution of the consciousness of the individual and humanity beyond its present stage of development; it can take place only if man is ready to take the turn towards which Nature has been slowly leading him, to discover himself, to know himself as soul and spirit, to see and lay Ærm hold on the Reality behind world and life and things after which he has been seeking through the ages. Nature's Ærst evolution has been an evolution of Matter, of physical objects, of the stage, scenery, external conditions and instruments of the drama of an evolving conscious Life in Matter. In life itself she has been content at Ærst to organise a physicality, an externality of life; the evolution of the body has been the sign, the instrument, the apparent cause of the evolution of consciousness. Even when she has arrived at the evolution of Mind, the mind of a humanity which is capable not only of knowing outwardly the external world but of going within itself, of knowing itself, of knowing the secret things, powers, forces which are behind itself and behind the works of a surface external Nature, still she has been most careful to organise a surface Mind dealing with surface and external things and an organisation of personality which is superÆcial and not the whole of ourselves, a wave only of the ocean of our hidden being, our secret reality. To build an ego which will deal with material life and nature as its user but also as its subject, a life that is bound by matter, a mind that is bound by both matter and life has been her main preoccupation. But still the evolution of consciousness is the real and central fact which gives a signiÆcance otherwise altogether lacking to the mechanical structure of the universe. Man is here not merely to utilise his world for the service of his individual and col- lective ego; he is here as a medium in which the Spirit within, the secret growing Consciousness can evolve farther its self- manifestation, arrive from a partial to a complete consciousness and, since life itself is there only as a means of this evolution and an image of it, at a complete and perfect individual and social life.

We begin with a riddle, we end with a mystery. Existence itself is the Ærst riddle. What it is we do not know, we are ignorant how it came to be at all, we cannot say whether it is an eternal fact or a temporary phenomenon. It may be only an appearance or it may be real, not in itself but as a manifestation of some hidden Reality; but then of what is it the manifestation and how came it into being or why had it to be? Consciousness of existence is a second insoluble miracle. It seems not to have been and now is and it may be that some day it will not be; yet it is a premier fact and without it being would not know of its own existence. Things might exist, but only as a useless encumbrance of a meaningless space, – consciousness makes being self-aware, gives it a signiÆcance. But what then is consciousness? Is it something in the very grain of being or an unstable result or fortuitous accident? To whom does it belong? to the world as a whole? or is it peculiar to individual being? Or has it come from elsewhere into this inanimate and inconscient universe? To what end this entry? The signiÆcance of our conscious being in an inconscient material world is the last and worst enigma.

Has it a meaning in the universe or in something beyond the universe? or is it only a chance outburst of Nature with no sense in it or any but a mechanical purpose? * All these problems arise in our consciousness and in our con- sciousness alone can be found their solution – or to it or through it perhaps from a greater consciousness the solution must come. On the nature and validity of our consciousness depends the nature and validity of the discovery we shall make or the conclusions to which we can come. On the power of our consciousness depends the possibility or impossibility of putting into the terms of life the solutions our knowledge discovers. But most of all the appearance and development of consciousness in the inconscient world is the decisive factor, the one thing that gives its existence a light of meaning, a possibility of purpose, a hope of fulÆlment and the soul's self-Ænding. To know, then, the nature of consciousness, its process, its birth, growth and destiny is for us a study of supreme importance. 84 All the problem of existence turns around three things, the nature of being, the nature of consciousness and the secret of the dynamics, the energy of existence by which being and con- sciousness Ænd each other and manifest what is within them. If we can discover these three things, all is known which we fundamentally need to know; the rest is application and process and consequence. The problem of consciousness is the central problem; for it links the other two together and creates their riddle. It is consciousness that raises the problem it has to solve; without it there would be no riddle and no solution. Being and its en- ergy would then fulÆl themselves in form and motion and in cessation of form and motion without any self-awareness and without any enjoyment or fruition of their form and motion."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"The Problem of Consciousness 273 Existence would be a fact without signiÆcance, the universe an inanimate machine turning for ever – or for a time, – without any reason or issue in its turning. For it to have any signiÆcance there must be either a Mind or some other kind of Awareness that observes it, originates it perhaps, has joy in its turning, works out something by the turning of the machine for its own satisfaction or dissatisfaction; or there must be a consciousness that emerges by the turning and reveals being and energy to themselves and leads them to some kind of fulÆlment. Even if it is only a temporary consciousness that emerges, yet that must be the one signiÆcant fact of being, the one thing that lights up its movements, makes it aware of itself, raises it to something that is more than a mere dead or blank self-existence, a One or a Many that is yet worth no more than a zero. Even if what fundamentally is in being, is not consciousness but a superconscience, yet that must be one supreme kind of self- awareness, if not also all-awareness; for otherwise there would be no difference between superconscience and inconscience; the two would be only top-side and bottom-side of the same blank, yet mysteriously but vainly fruitful reality. In the ancient tradition eternal and inÆnite Being and Con- sciousness carry in them as the result of their oneness or coex- istence an eternal signiÆcance of Bliss, Ananda. If we suppose Being-Consciousness to carry in them an eternal and inÆnite energy that creates, as we say, expresses, as the Sanskrit term better puts it, the universe, then the bliss of eternal conscious being would contain in itself a bliss of eternal energy of con- sciousness and being Ænding itself in the joy of self-expression, self-manifestation, self-creation. That would be a sufÆcient ex- planation of the appearance of a phenomenal universe, there is in fact no other that is satisfactory. These then are there the three or the four terms underlying all the secret of existence, – Being, Consciousness-Energy, Bliss of being, Ananda. It would not materially affect the fundamental satisfactori- ness of this explanation that the world we live in is not a world of bliss, not a world of consciousness, – though it is in its evident appearance, a world of being and of energy of being, that it is in"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"274 Essays Divine and Human its phenomenal basis inconscient and works itself out through process and labour and, when consciousness appears, through joy of being but also through pain of being. If the eternal creative Energy takes joy in that, has the Ananda of it (and without consciousness there can be no joy or Ananda), as a poet in the creation of his tragedy or comedy, then that would be a sufÆcient explanation of the existence of this universe, though we would still have to seek for its signiÆcance, the reason of this choice of pain and labour. Consciousness then is the centre of the riddle. If we know what is Consciousness, where its action begins and ends – if it has a beginning and an ending, what is its process and the signiÆcance of its temporal appearance and action, we shall then be able to look deeply into being and its energy and understand and solve all their enigma. * But here in our world of Matter the original and fundamental phenomenon we meet everywhere is a universal Inconscience, Consciousness appears to come in as only an incident, a develop- ment, a strange consequence of some ill-understood operations of Energy in inconscient Matter. It arises out of an original In- conscience, it dissolves or sinks back into the Inconscience. Once it has appeared it persists indeed but as a general phenomenon precariously manifested in individual living beings. It has the seeming either of an uncertain freak of inconscient Nature, – a disease some would conjecture, a phosphorescence playing upon the stagnant waters of inconscient being, active at certain points of animation, or a guest in a world in which it is alien, a foreign resident with difÆculty able to maintain itself in a hardly amicable environment and atmosphere. According to the materialist hypothesis consciousness must be a result of energy in Matter; it is Matter's reaction or reØex to itself in itself, a response of organised inconscient chemical substance to touches upon it, a record of which that inconscient substance through some sensitiveness of cell and nerve becomes"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"The Problem of Consciousness 275 inexplicably aware. But such an explanation may account, – if we admit this impossible magic of the conscious response of an inconscient to the inconscient, – for sense and reØex action [yet] becomes absurd if we try to explain by it thought and will, the imagination of the poet, the attention of the scientist, the rea- soning of the philosopher. Call it mechanical cerebration, if you will, but no mere mechanism of grey stuff of brain can explain these things; a gland cannot write Hamlet or pulp of brain work out a system of metaphysics. There is no parity, kinship or visible equation between the alleged cause or agent on the one side and on the other the effect and its observable process. There is a gulf here that cannot be bridged by any stress of forcible afÆrmation or crossed by any stride of inference or violent leap of argu- mentative reason. Consciousness and an inconscient substance may be connected, may interpenetrate, may act on each other, but they are and remain things opposite, incommensurate with each other, fundamentally diverse. An observing and active con- sciousness emerging as a character of an eternal Inconscience is a self-contradictory afÆrmation, an unintelligible phenomenon, and the contradiction must be healed or explained before this afÆrmation can be accepted. But it cannot be healed unless either the Inconscient has a latent power for consciousness – and then its inconscience is phenomenal only, not fundamental, – or else is the veil of a Consciousness which emerges out of a state of involution which appears to us as an inconscience. There is no doubt a connection and interdependence be- tween consciousness and the inconscient substance in which it resides and through which it seems to operate. Consciousness depends upon the body and its functionings, on the brain, nerves, gland-action, right physiological working, for its own Ærm state and action. It uses them as its instruments and, if they are in- jured or unable to act, the action of the consciousness may also be in part or whole impaired, impeded or suspended. But this does not prove that the action of consciousness is an action of the body and nothing else. There is an instrumentation and if the instrument is impaired, the user of the instrument can no longer manifest himself rightly through it; if it is destroyed, he"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"276 Essays Divine and Human cannot operate any longer unless or until he can get another instrument. This then has to be seen whether the phenomena of consciousness are such that they make it necessary to suppose such a use or instrumentation of the body. If so then either there must be a conscious being in us that is other than the body or else a conscious Energy that thinks, senses, observes, acts intelligently through the physical instru- ment. This is what we actually observe in our experience of ourselves that there is such a being or else such an energy at work in us and this self-experience is surely as valid, as binding as the accompanying experience of an inconscient substance or building of inconscient Matter which is its Æeld and habitat. Both sides of the phenomenon must be given their value; to reject Matter as an illusion of Consciousness or Consciousness as a freak or disease of Matter are equally one-eyed views which miss the true problem and are not likely to lead to a satisfying solution. It is certainly possible, prima facie, that Consciousness may be a subordinate phenomenon dependent on Matter or, more ac- curately, on the Energy that formulates Matter. Our need then is to discover its exact nature, origin, function in a material world and the utmost limit of its possibilities for the human being; for to man matter is only a basis of his life, a material of his works, an opportunity; what is really important to him is consciousness, for it is his consciousness and use of consciousness that gives him his signiÆcance and importance to himself and the world; without it he would be nothing and mean nothing. At any rate this is the fact that faces us, that there is an apparent Energy that seems to have built up this world which Ærst in the animal and then more amply in man has become and works as a conscious Energy and that this transformation is the crucial and capital fact of our universe. It may well be that in it lies the secret of the signiÆcance of that universe. It may turn out on deeper enquiry that a Conscious Energy has created as its Æeld an inconscient substance and is veiled in its creation and emerges in it, a Power, a Godhead releasing itself slowly and with difÆculty out of its self-made chrysalis of material Inconscience."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"The Problem of Consciousness 277 It is not sufÆcient to examine the material, the physiological processes accompanying the functioning of consciousness and attempt to explain the functioning by its physical processes. This leaves consciousness itself unexplained; if it accounts to some extent, but imperfectly, for sense phenomena or mechanical thinking, it does not account in the least for the most important powers of our conscious energy; it does not account for reason, understanding, will, creative thought, conscious selection, the conscious intellectual and spiritual action and self-development of the human being. Yet these are of capital importance, for it is here that consciousness begins to unfold itself out of its chrysalis or matrix of inconscience and a half conscious Ærst working and reveal its true nature. Here consciousness acts in its own right, in its own Æeld and not as a product of the body. To see how the body uses consciousness may be within limits a fruitful science, but it is more important to see how consciousness uses the body and still more important to see how it evolves and uses its own powers. The physiological study of the phenomenon of consciousness is only a side-issue; the psychological study of it independent of all reference to the body except as an instrument is the fruitful line of inquiry. A body using consciousness is the Ærst outward physical fact of our existence, the Ærst step of our evolution; a consciousness using a body is its inner spiritual reality, it is what we have become by our evolution and more and more completely are[.] What Is Consciousness? 85 Consciousness – but what is consciousness?

In the middle it plays a great role in the life of animal and man, but its action is crude and ill-developed in the animal, imperfect in the human creature. Its evolution wears the character of an episode in the long history of an inconscient world, a chapter that began some time ago, but one knows not why it intervened at all or how it will end or whether its appearance has any meaning, whether its developing importance has an accidental and meaningless or a purposeful and revelatory character. It may be a freak of creative Chance or it may be or may carry in itself the whole meaning of the world-drama. In an inconscient universe, in a Nature or the working of an Energy which is fundamentally material, the emergence [of] Consciousness has at Ærst the air of a surprising, a contradictory, an impossible event. For in such a world, in the working of such a Nature or Energy, how could it ever come into existence? Either there is no real consciousness, only an action of Matter or unconscious Energy which takes this inexplicable and deceptive form, or Nature or Energy is not fundamentally inconscient. Consciousness was always a possibility which at a certain stage chanced or was bound to take place, or it was a latent power that has become manifest. Or even it may be all Nature is really conscious and it is we who foist inconscience upon her because we are limited to a certain range and character of consciousness and cannot communicate with her other ranges or even detect their existence. It has been held by a certain opinion that consciousness in itself does not exist, there are only phenomena of reactions of Matter to Matter or of Energy in Matter to Energy in Mat- ter to which by generalisation we give the name. There is no person who is conscious, thinks, speaks, perceives, wills, acts; it is an organised body in which certain chemical, molecular, cellular, glandular and nerve activities take place and certain material results and reactions of these activities take place in the brain which take the form of these phenomena. It is the"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"The Problem of Consciousness 279 body that thinks, perceives, wills, speaks, acts; it is Matter that goes through these operations and becomes aware of them; it may be said that brain-matter makes a record or notation of these actions and this notation is consciousness and this record is memory. There is nothing in the world except Matter and the operations of Matter. This theory arose when physical Science concentrated on the operations of Matter, saw only Matter and energy of Matter everywhere; it persists even after that seeing of things has been severely shaken. For now we are driven to see and say that there is no such thing as Matter in itself; what we call Matter is only a mass of phenomena of Energy, events of energy, which our senses regard as objects and our minds classify under the general name of Matter. But we can still hold that all phenomena are phenomena of Energy acting in the forms or sensible events which we call Matter and the phenomena of consciousness are of that character. There is nothing else to it, nothing but the mobile and executive Energy, Nature, Prakriti; there is no soul, no Purusha. Consciousness would still be a general name for a brain-record and notation of these events of material Energy and this will still be the true character of thought, perception, will, speech, act. All these events are separate phenomena which may act and react on each other or group themselves together, but they are not the result or manifestations of any one general force or power of being that we can call Consciousness. 86 Consciousness, – but what is consciousness? And Ærst of all we have to face the possibility that there is no such thing. For many hold that the word is an unreal general- isation invented to cover a class of material phenomena having their origin in Matter and material in their nature and essence, an operation of Matter on Matter and in Matter. Thoughts are only vibrations of the grey matter of the brain; they are not something other [than] that or capable of existing beyond the material plane; they cannot exist independently of the brain; brain is not"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"280 Essays Divine and Human their instrument of expression or manifestation; they are [its] instrument made of its substance, dependent on [its] substance, inexistent without it. Mind is an action of Matter, not a separate power or force; there is nothing in it superior to the physicality of the body; it exists by the body and as a part of its activity, lasts along with it, dies with it. Mind is a product of gases, some operation of Nature's chemistry, glandular inØuences, nervous stimuluses; it is matter and records the operations of Matter. But why then this appearance of mentality, of consciousness, of a conscious being? That too is only a trick of Matter. They are reØexes and reactions to the contacts of things outside, to other material objects, bodies, movements, forces. Sense and sensation are the reply of the nerves to stimulus of external and material things or to internal stimuli that are still material. To the experience of the body the result of these, recoils, reØexes, reactions, may seem mental, but that cannot alter the fact that they are material products of the workings of Matter. Well, be it so; but still this mentality creates an awareness of self and things and the movements of self and things, even if both be only a body and so many other bodies, and it is difÆcult to describe awareness as an inconscient movement or condition or as the inconscient seeming to be conscious. Evidently we are in face of a general sophism invented by specialists of a limited Æeld of data, the data of inconscient Matter, who are determined to force everything into its characteristic formulas and refuse to admit everything else. We must at least recover the right to see this awareness and its movements as they are or as they present themselves to us and see how far it leads us and whether indeed, even if it occurs in matter and the body, it does not lead us to something other than the body and other than Matter. The materialist contention that consciousness is not a separate power or force or manifestation of energy like electricity or magnetism or steam, but only a name for a particular bundle of brain phenomena, cannot hide the startling fact that inconscient and insentient Matter has become sentient and conscient even if it be only at points, in jets, in small masses.

If the consciousness that can do all this is not a force, a power in itself, it at least looks strangely like it. And we have the right, at least hypothetically, to study it as such a power or force and Ænd out how far that leads us. It may even lead us to the discovery of a Reality greater than the world of Matter or of Energy building up shapes of Matter and movements in Matter. It may take us beyond phenomena and appearances to the truth of things and to something that is the origin of all that seems to be[.] * At the other extreme of human mentality we meet a similar and more devastating denial. Consciousness has no real existence; or, so far as it exists at all, it is as a dynamic Power, a creator of illusions. There is nothing sound or real in what it builds; there is nothing true in what it sees; the world it shows us is [an] impossible chimera, a mass of Ægments and falsehoods. The sole consciousness that is true is the self-awareness of some abso- lute Silence, a spaceless immobile InÆnite, a timeless featureless Eternity. Or, as the materialist sees only a bundle of phenom- ena material and dependent on Matter or a fortuitous result of material operations, so the Nihilistic Buddhist sees only a bundle of associations, sanskaras , which stuck together produce the false appearance of a continuity of concrete phenomena or a stream of momentary perceptions giving the impression of a false self and coherent world, a coherent personality, but if the bundle is dissolved, if the stream ceases to Øow, all dissolves and"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"282 Essays Divine and Human collapses and shows the empty Nothingness which is the only eternal truth and the sole eternal reality. This superconscient Nothingness has no need of consciousness [for] the greatness of its emptiness or its everlasting peace of unconscious bliss. To return to Nothingness is the only use or meaning of existence. Here too we seem to be in front of [the] sophism of a specialist seizing the sole salient and striking side, the one promi- nent aspect of Truth in which he is versed putting aside all the rest as inconsistent or invalid. After all the world exists and is too persistent and effective and solid a phenomenon to be put aside or merely whistled off the Æeld with an airy ™It is not∫; – a mirage is ineffectual and recedes or fades if it is touched, an illusion dissolves if revealed but this is stupendously effec- tive, overwhelmingly persistent and we have to sound all its possibilities before dismissing it as something vain and triØing. World-consciousness may be only one aspect of our being, but it is a big and momentous aspect and it too should be given its full chance of justifying itself before it is ruled out of court. The eternal reality of a pure immobile existence and its self- awareness is also a truth of our being. But it is not impossible that these are two aspects of one Reality and not so incompatible as the metaphysical logician imagines. This is what we propose to do integrally and with a full and exhaustive inquiry before we decide either way. The chances are that so enormous a thing as this world is something more than an astonishing chimera. The chances are that when two such great aspects of existence confront each other, there is a connection somewhere, a recon- ciliation of their contraries. It is possible that both are aspects, static and dynamic, of some absolute Reality from which both have drawn their own reality and in which they have their true and inevitable place. * In any case consciousness is the one thing by which we can consider or decide the question at all.

If consciousness has no reality and no value, then there is nothing by which we can know the truth, – one explanation of things has then as little value as the other, neither can be claimed as the truth. The consciousness by which we afÆrm the featureless sole Reality can be as fallacious as that by which we afÆrm our individual self and the universe. If consciousness is the self-awareness of the eternal Exis- tence, it can only be this self-awareness seeing its own power and the works of its power as a real world. If consciousness is a creation of the evolution, it is also the one thing by which it receives some value, the one thing by which its values can be reckoned, its [...],itsonecentraland essential value. It is not by the development of forms that evolution reaches its height, but by the evolution of consciousness. The degree of consciousness is the degree of evolution; the extent to which consciousness has developed its powers, range, height, its fulness of vision and self-vision, is the measure of the evolution's development of its work and aim, its progress towards its goal, if goal indeed it has and is not the incoherent working out of an accidental Chance. Indeed, if we look at the way in which the Inconscient has devised the world and the sequences by which it has arrived at intelligence, we have some reason [to think] that it is a secret Consciousness which has made this world and under the mask of inconscience has emerged as a slow process of an Ignorance developing Knowledge. If so, it may well be that it is the self-awareness of the [eternal Existence] that is working out in the formula of incon- scient Matter and ignorant Life and half-awakened Mind its own self-manifestation in the material universe. 87 But what is consciousness and what its relation to existence?

By what spiritual or mechan- ical necessity? by what mechanical chance or accidental process of Energy? To what end or purpose, if any purpose there can be in an inconscient mechanism of brute Necessity or inexplicably organised Chance or any end in a movement which never had any reason for beginning? Does consciousness exist or is it a fortuitous illusion? Who or what is it that becomes conscious in the animal and in the body of the human being? Three possible solutions. Consciousness has not come into being but was and is always there, a fundamental power of existence, latent or involved or concealed from our mind and sense even in what we call inanimate and unconscious things. It has not come into existence but has emerged from existence; involved it has evolved in the general evolutionary process. Or consciousness is only a phenomenon, a surprising result of cer- tain inconscient processes of Nature, unintentional but actual, unnecessary and accidental or else somehow inevitable as an output of chemical and other physical energies which could not help imposing itself at a certain point of their activity in the natural course of things. It did not exist before that point was reached; when another point has been reached it may go out of existence. Or again the world is a creation of an extra- cosmic or immanent conscious Being personal or impersonal who has either put his consciousness or a consciousness resem- bling his into his mechanical creation to be an element there or else has infused it from within into the mechanical self- expression in which he has chosen to dwell as its upholder, inspirer, inhabitant. What is meant by consciousness? what is this phenomenon which seems to have so small a part in the vast inconscient mass of things and is yet the sole element here that can give any value to the universe? And to come to the heart of the difÆculty – is it indeed only a phenomenon, an appearance that has emerged in the course of the workings of an Energy which was, is and will always remain inconscient? Or is it something fundamental, an inherent reality"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The Problem of Consciousness 285 or a latent character or power of that Energy and bound to emerge at some time once it had begun its workings? 88 It is to a mass of ill-connected and ill-understood phenomena that we give this name of consciousness; when these are at work we say that a man or animal is conscious, when they are suspended we say that he or it is unconscious; where they are absent, as in a tree, we suppose the object, even if it has life, to be inconscient by its very nature, incapable of sensa- tion no less than empty of thought and will. Where life is not, inconscience seems to us a still more self-evident character of the thing or being. Man alone is fully conscious, for he alone is aware of himself, reØective on things, in full possession of mental capacities and their aware and observant use. Mind and consciousness are almost synonymous to our ordinary notions; where consciousness is not mentalised, we Ænd it difÆcult to recognise its presence, hardly possible to follow its movements; even in the animal we are apt to regard it as reØex movement not aware of itself, undeveloped, primitive. 89 All that exists or can exist in this or any other universe can be rendered into terms of consciousness; there is nothing that cannot be known. This knowing need not be always a mental knowledge. For the greater part of existence is either above or below mind, and mind can know only indirectly what is above or what is below it. But the one true and complete way of knowing is by direct knowledge. All can be rendered into terms of consciousness because all is either a creation of consciousness or else one of its forms.

A conscious, half conscious or subconscious participation in the awareness of the InÆnite is the basis of all knowledge. All things are inhabited by this consciousness, even the things that seem to us inconscient and the consciousness in one form can communicate with or contact the consciousness in another or else penetrate or contain or identify with it. This in one form or another is the true process of all knowledge; the rest is ignorant appearance. All things are one self; it is the one Knower who knows him- self everywhere, from one centre or another in the multiplicity of his play. Otherwise no knowledge would be possible. The Secret below the Surface 90 All life, all existence is an enigma to the human mind, because the mind is a light which sees only the surfaces of things or at most a little below the surface and is moreover limited by its own circumscribed area of vision. It cannot see what is beyond those limits and yet there are an inÆnity of things beyond its circle. It cannot see what is above, it cannot see what is within, it cannot see what is below. But what is on the surface is never the truth of things; the surface presents us only with facts not with truths, with phenomena not with realities, with imperfect indications, not with the realisation of things in themselves. The secret, the truth, the reality of things is above, within, below, it is not on their surface. 91 There is a meaning in the universe, an intention in cosmic exis- tence; there is a signiÆcance of the individual, his life is a sign and has a purpose."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"The Problem of Consciousness 287 The true truth of things is not apparent on the surface, it is something hidden. Truth is not obvious, it comes always as a discovery, Life is the working out of a secret, the process and progress of a mystery; we too are not what we seem to be, we have to Ænd and become ourself. What we seem to be is a thinking human animal. What we are and have to become is God; the secret purpose of our existence here is to Ænd the occult Reality of ourselves and the world, to become Divine. 92 Our existence in the world has a reality which is other than that which strikes our mind and senses on the surface. It contains a secret, a mystery which we have to discover, for through that discovery we must move both to the realisation of our self and spirit and the perfection and fulÆlment of our life in Nature. Our life is not an illusion nor a delirium nor is Nature a Maya, a fabricator of dreams or a dealer in vanities as certain religions would have it nor is one the outcome of a blind Force or the trick [of] a blind self-regulating Chance, the other an unconscious Power as it must be if the materialists' dogma were true. Our life is neither a freak of God nor a freak of Nature; it has a conscious plan although a secret plan, a signiÆcance although an occult and mystic signiÆcance. The plan, the signiÆcance are secret and mysterious to us because we live on the surface of ourselves and things and are not in touch with either their core or their height or depths. Science on one side, Religion and Philosophy on the other try to arrive at the hidden Truth, but each touches and only just touches one end of it and refuses to go farther and discover the other end or the link and reconciling relation between these two poles of existence.

Consciousness emerging in the universe of life and mind is the bridge and link between the two poles. But our human consciousness is a term in the chain which is aware only of itself and sees all the rest in its own terms; it cannot identify itself with the other links and misses their signiÆcance and their purpose. It stands on the middle of the bridge looking all around it, but the bridgeheads are to its sight invisible. It cannot see what is there, but only speculate, infer or conjecture. Science questing with its measuring rod of empirical experi- ment begins to have a dark glimpse of the Inconscient; it knows the universe as an organised freak that has emerged from the material Inconscience and will go back to its source. Religion and Philosophy rise on the wings of spiritual experience or in a balloon of metaphysical logic into some stratosphere of super- conscient Reality, they seem to discover a God or Self or Spirit or Absolute and try to map it with the intellect or to turn it into a dynamic spiritual formula. But they are unable to reconcile these three terms of being; their physical experiments or their spiritual experiences are valid, but each has hold of only one end of the enigma. Science has discovered Evolution; Religion and Philosophy have discovered something of that which is involved and evolves in this cosmic Existence. But the two discoveries have refused to shed light upon each other; each has shut itself up in its own formulas. This is because each is a creation and activity of Mind, Science of the concretising experimental mind, Phi- losophy of the abstracting intellectual mind, Religion of the dynamic spiritual mind. But Mind is bound always by its partial formulations of the Truth; Mind grasps formulas or images but is itself grasped by its own creations, it cannot get free from them or go beyond them. But the mind's concepts and formulas are only fragmentary representations of Truth or pointers or abstract schemas and images, not her very self and reality.

If the Ærst view is right, the view so long pressed on us by physical Science, then this very universe itself is but a queer paradoxical movement of mindless eyeless Force or of a brute substance emanating purposeless energy, which yet works as if it had a purpose; for it produces by some inconscient compulsion on itself a steady succession of evolutionary forms that carry themselves as if they had an aim and a meaning, although in the nature of things they can really have none. The whole is a mechanism which automatically turns out what it must with a certain inevitability but has no comprehending Intelligence, no intuitive Power behind it to determine its use. Universal Nature is a Chance that works as if it were a Necessity or else perhaps a Necessity that works like a self-regulating Chance. What seems to be consciousness has come out of this machine just like every- thing else in this singular freak-universe, constituted somehow, miraculously, impossibly, as the plant and the Øower came out of the seed, somehow constituted, or as different chemical atoms are mysteriously constituted out of variant numbers of identical electrons, or as water leaps inexplicably into birth by a combina- tion in exact measure of two gases.

But this too is an imagination, a nonexistence. There can be no consciousness in the Inconscient, no Conscious in unconscious things, no superconscience.

We start writing and Ænish the writing without knowing what we have written. We are walking with our mind aware and guiding our course, – the [?outer] mind, – but we continue to walk and Ænd ourselves after a time farther on the intended way or beyond the intended goal or turn and have to retrace our steps. In an unconscious or half conscious moment words pour from our lips which we would never have spoken if we had used our fully awake mind and will.

It must be either something of the mind behind or below its active surface movement or something of a driving life-force or action of the body. But in the Ærst explanation there must be a part of the mind, not our conscious thought and will that is capable of continuing automatically a course once habitual or previously Æxed or pursuing of itself the direction accustomed or repetitive. It is capable not only of execution but of a radical direction, even a misdirection. This means a consciousness at conscious work, however vague or latently automatic, and can only be described as a subconscient or at least partly subconscious or subjacent, an underlying something else akin to consciousness.

Even if we take the creation to be illusory, still the illusory creation is there and there is a Force or Energy or Power that has created it, whether it be mere unconscious Energy, Prakriti, or an energy of deceptive consciousness, Maya. What we actually experience here is an energy inconscient or seemingly inconscient which is in constant motion and in that motion takes on forms or produces forms and in these forms it enters into many kinds of activity and engenders a multitude of active relations.

Objects innumerable there are, lives too and things living, a Mind or minds, a Consciousness or consciousnesses or else perhaps mere phenomena in the Inconscient to which we give these names; but all these appear to us as if they were temporary results, events ephemeral or long persistent of the movement of Energy and action, its Karma.

How can things in their very nature inconscient and unaware become conscious or develop some kind of awareness? There is here a contradiction which is inexplicable and the more we look at it, becomes more and more inexplicable. This is possible because inconscience is a phenomenon not a fundamental reality. A phenomenon is something that appears to us, but does not show to us the whole reality of existence or of its own existence; it is a front, a face, a circumstance of something more than itself that does not appear but is – the Reality. Inconscience is a phenomenal state; it is consciousness that is the Reality; consciousness is an inherent and eternal state of being, inconscience is its temporal, temporary and apparent condition when it forms itself by its own energy into Matter and material objects. Its consciousness involves itself in inanimate Matter and seems there an inconscience; its energy too acts as if it were an inconscient energy, doing things without knowing what it is doing, creating a universe but unaware of the universe it creates, contriving millions of devices, but without any intelli- gence. So it seems, but so it cannot be; there is something hidden from us which we have to discover. It is the consciousness behind the Energy, the conscious Being behind the action that we have to discover.

Spiritual being is their continent, they are not its constituents, but its outer results and the diverse representative selves of its consciousness and action. Not, either, the supramental being. For the supramental be- ing is one with the spirit in its original or basic consciousness, in its idea-consciousness it is ideally comprehensive of cosmic things or, if we must speak in terms of space, commensurate with the universe. The supramental being with one action of his Idea-self can regard universal being as his object of will and knowledge. That attitude is the seed of mind. It can regard it as contained in itself and itself contained in it, and in that way know and govern it. But it can too, like Spirit in its real action know all things by identity and govern all things by identity. Externality of being does not enter into supramental experience. Supermind can see mind externalising objects; it can itself take a particular viewpoint fronting objects but it is in itself that it fronts them, as we front our subjective operations in mind. It does not regard them as something outside its own being, as we regard physically objects. Mind is a delegation from supermind, which primarily re- gards existence as an object fronting its vision.

In fact body is a knot of conscious being built up by its own energy, instinct with nervous or subnervous life, – because the energy is in dynamic actuality a living energy – cognizing and cog- nized by subconscious or superÆcially conscious sense, because the energy is in a certain inherent reality a conscious energy. It is a knot indivisible in reality from universal Consciousness and Force and Substance but in a certain empirical utility of selective action separative rather than separate. Body, not really separate, is limited by subconscious instinct of separation and energetic tendency of separation, but not capable of effecting real separation. All its movements are a practical result of selective experience and selective action which is based on a phenomenon of separate physical being. Body is separated from other bodies by intervention of universal matter, but both of the separate bodies are one with the indivisible intervening matter, therefore not separate in re- ality, but indivisibly connected in energy, and one matter in fundamental reality. Put otherwise, two bodies are images or formations of one indivisible ethereal space, which is in reality one indivisible movement of material energy, life-energy, mind energy. This inseparable connection and fundamental unity of bodies become of immense importance when we examine the relation of the appearances of consciousness to its reality. Mind in body has to begin from the separation proper to body. Embodied mind is bound down in its root-action to a separative view of the universe. This is its waking view; sublimi- nally, whether in subconscious mentality or where it approaches or touches the superconscient being, it is capable of bridging the artiÆcial separation."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 305 Taking this separative basis of waking consciousness for itself and for a reality, the house of imprisoned awareness from which it looks at the world, it is bound to see objects as external to this awareness and this conscious vision. Embodied mind is as if a walled house were to have a thinking soul and spirit (air and ether) and look at things not in itself as things outside through windows (the senses), receive the touches of the outside air (nervous life-impacts) as if other than the air in itself; even its own ether as other than the rest of ether (my soul and other souls). This is the self and not-self of our mentality. Mind subliminal is able, though not normally habituated, to bridge the gulf between self and not-self; where it approaches the superconscient, this gulf lessens and conscience of oneness grows upon the being. Body is only the instrument and basis of this extreme separa- tive individuation, not its Ærst cause. Mind itself is a prior cause; but mentality in itself need not be rigidly separative: especially, subliminal mind has a large integrating power. Mind in itself is only the basis of a relatively separative plurality; mind in body increases this relation into a phenomenon of absolutely separative plurality. From this basis of externalising individuation and separative plurality waking mental consciousness in the physical universe commences its operations. 103 Psychology is the knowledge of consciousness and its operations. A complete psychology must be a complex of the science of mind, its operations and its relations to life and body with intuitive and experimental knowledge of the nature of mind and its relations to supermind and spirit. A complete psychology cannot be a pure natural science, but must be a compound of science and metaphysical knowledge. This necessity arises from the difference between natural or physical sciences and psychology. A physical science is a knowledge of physical processes"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"306 Essays Divine and Human which leads inevitably to action and use of physical processes. The scientist may only regard scientiÆc truth and not utility; but he can Ænd only truth of the process of things, not truth of the nature of things. His discoveries bring about inevitably an utility for action; for all truth of process is an utility for action. Even when not the aim of science, process and utility are the soul and body of physical science. Matter itself is only an utility of Spirit or Being or Nature for physical process and action. Material energy is an instrumental dynamis for that utility or else an original dynamis which has no other sense of its operations. We get beyond to a higher sense only when [we] get beyond material to mental, psychical and spiritual energy, to mind, soul and spirit. Debateable it is whether if we knew the real essence of Matter and the basic, not only the apparent, relations of mind, soul and spirit to matter and material operations, we could not arrive at an inÆnitely more potent use of physical process and operations. But in any case these things cannot be discov- ered by physical science; it has its limits and cannot exceed its limits. Psychology may begin as a natural science, but it deals already with superphysical and must end in a metaphysical enquiry. If one side of the process it studies and its method of en- quiry is physical, the other and more important is non-physical; it is a direct observation of mental operations by mind without any regard to their physiological meaning, support, substratum or instrumentation. If this is in the Ærst place a study of process and involves an utility for psychological action, yet what it leads to inevitably is not that action but an enquiry into the nature of mental consciousness. This necessity arises from the immediate perception by mind of something beyond and behind its operations, some energy of hidden consciousness greater than our apparent mentality. To know what that is, we have to resort to a metaphysical enquiry. Consciousness is itself found to be not essentially a pro- cess, – although in mind it appears as a process, but the very"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 307 nature of self-existent being. Being or the Self of things can only be known by metaphysical – not necessarily intellectual – knowledge. This self-knowledge has two inseparable aspects, a psy- chological knowledge of the process of Being, a metaphysical knowledge of its principles and essentiality. We Ænd that one of these principles of being is energy. Energy is an eternal and inherent power of conscious being. Since all energy is convertible to action, this knowledge also contains a side of psychological and spiritual utility, – eventually perhaps even, since life and body are results of the energy of being and supports of its action, of vital and physical utility. Two great utilities open before psychology. We may acquire the possibility of a greater being, consciousness and energy. We may open up the possibility and discover the psychical means or process [of] becoming consciously one with our original self- existent Being, with God, the Absolute, the Transcendence. To lead up to these possibilities is the aim of Vedantic psychology. 104 All psychology must result in and every complete statement of psychological truth must have for its frame a double schema of existence into which the facts it deals with must fall, a descending scale and an ascending scale. The simplest elementary psychology deals with three notes of a limited scale, – the body and physical Æeld and its impacts, the life and body and biological and physiological processes, the mental being and its conscious experience and action. This is a scale of ascension. * The nature of the physical Æeld is the Ærst fact; it determines everything else; it gives the impacts which awaken the conscious- ness, the impressions, images, subjects which are its matter, the starting-point and basis of all its conceptions, the body which is"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"308 Essays Divine and Human its support, instrument, fulcrum of action, the physical occasion of the sense of self. Everything appears to be in the body or by the body and either for the body or for the I-sense in the body. The body seems to be the principal if not the only cause or determinant of individual consciousness. What is not of the body is of the physical Æeld outside the body. Whatever in consciousness seems not to be of the physi- cal Æeld, yet appears to be derived from it, to be a resultant, development or deformation from physical experience. * The life in the body is the necessary modiÆcation of the Ærst fact of material being, without whose intervention consciousness is unable to manifest in any material form. The atom is a form of matter, the stone is a material body, but life in these things is either nil or not developed to the point where manifestation of consciousness becomes possible. Consciousness in the atom and the stone is either latent, non-manifest to us, suppressed, potential or nil. Life in any degree is not sufÆcient for the manifestation of mental consciousness. A certain high degree of it or else a certain indispensable kind of organisation is needed for this third tone of the scale. Plants are living, even in a degree intensely living, they have a nervous organisation, but consciousness is either nil or latent, non-manifest at least to us, suppressed or else of another kind than ours, a submental nervous consciousness and not mentality. Life supplies certain biological conditions and certain phys- iological processes which physically underlie the operations of conscious mental being. Life gives the intermediate dynamic link between mind and body. Life has two operations which serve the purpose of mental- ity, a necessary life power in a nervous apparatus and a capacity"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 309 of instrumental development and modiÆcation. Without the power of life in the nervous apparatus consciousness in the body is impossible; without the power of developing modiÆcations it might exist as in the lower animals, but it could not expand as in man. The nervous apparatus is the initial biological fact necessary to mentality. Life power consists not of the nervous system, which is a physical element, but of a new power or energy of which the system is the vehicle, – the power of nervous com- munication, nervous charge, nervous discharge. This power is not sufÆcient to create mentality, for the plant too possesses them, yet does not appear to be a mental being, but it is the Ærst condition of embodied mentality. A power of biological and physiological development is the secondary, continuative factor necessary to farther evolution of mentality. Once the nervous vital power appears in material body, it shows a biological power of developing a more complex physical instrumentation for a more complex nervous activity. Once it has attained a certain complexity of physical instrumen- tation, life seems able indeÆnitely to reÆne in some subtle way its action of nervous power so as to support a more and more Æne and complex action of mentality. How far this development of mentality can go and how far it is dependent on the physical apparatus and the nervous action is one of the capital questions of psychology. * Mental being, power and operation of mental consciousness is the third note of the scale of being. Mind cannot certainly be said to be constituted of life and body, nervous action and reaction in a physical body. Nervous action does not appear to constitute of itself consciousness, any more than physical impact and consequent atomic disturbance appears of itself to constitute nervous action. As a correspon- dent or resultant nervous communication, charge and discharge is necessary to manifest life, so a resultant or correspondent"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"310 Essays Divine and Human conscious action, – sensation, perception, thought, conscious motiving impulsion, desire, intention, will, – are necessary to manifest mind. Mind may or may not be an exact result, reØection or cor- respondence of life action in body, life thinking itself out in body, body living and thinking out its experience in mind, but it is not the same thing as life and body. Life is a new or second power emerging from or in material energy. Mind is a new or third power emerging from or in the life-energy. * But this is only the ascending scale. Mind is not only awakened by life-action in the body at a certain evolutionary pitch of its operations; mind reacts upon and in certain ways uses, for its own characteristic purpose, modiÆes by its will to act and increase the life action and the ways of the body. Mind is not limited in its thoughts by the life and body. There is an action in it which is more than a creative stress of life, an attempt to image supraphysical realities, which we may dismiss as an illusion or a result of abnormal physiological states, but may also follow as Ærst clues to a greater truth and possibly a higher tone or tones of the scale of being. In that case, mind appears as a larger thing than life and material being. Though apparently an evolution from life and the body, it may have been in reality a prior power, life and body only its occasions and means for self-manifestation on the material plane of being. At any rate, psychology has to regard the scale not only from the upward point of view of body creating life, life creating mind, but from the downward point of view of mind creating new life in body. Evidently mind is a greater thing, higher than life and body. In that case, besides the ascending scale of the lower rising to a highest possibility, we must regard a possibility of the descending"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 311 scale, the highest reality involving itself in the lower conditions of being. But the question arises whether mind itself is the highest possibility or the highest reality[.] * Vedantic psychology explores the idea and intuition of a higher reality than mind. The intuition can only be veriÆed by psychological experi- ence exceeding the normal action of mind. This experience may lead to constantly ascending intuitions veriÆed by an ascent of experience to some summit of being. Beyond mind psychological experience Ænds another power of energy, another note in the scale of being. This we will call the supermind. This supermind lives and acts natively in a domain of experience of which the mind becomes aware by a reØective experience and calls vaguely spirit or spiritual being. Spirit is found to have three tones of its being. Triune, it makes each successively a power of its energy, a status of spiritual experience and form of its action. Triune, they are inseparable, but one or other can be so stressed as to appear a leading principle. But we have to note three essential facts about spirit: – Spirit is inÆnite consciousness, even when it dwells upon Ænite formulations of conscious being. Awareness of spirit is inÆnite self-awareness. All its three essential principles must have this character of inÆnity. InÆnite self-conscious bliss is the Ærst; inÆnite self-conscious conscious energy is the second; inÆnite self-conscious existence the third principle of spirit. Existence, consciousness, bliss are the three tones of inÆnity, the three basic colours of the Absolute. * The ascending scale of being presents then seven notes, matter,"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"312 Essays Divine and Human life, mind, supermind, bliss self, self of conscious energy, self of primary conscious existence. But the experience we get as we ascend in the scale leads us to the discovery that what in evolution appears subsequent is prior in reality. Life evolves in matter, but was preexistent to matter, latent, omnipresent, waiting for matter to be ready to be manifest – which it does when the movement of energy reaches a certain intensity. Mind evolves in embodied life, but was preexistent to matter and life, latent, omnipresent, involved, a hidden cause of action waiting for life and matter to be ready for its manifestation which comes when the movement of energy has reached a greater intensity. So supermind is prior to mind, latent, omnipresent, in- volved even in matter and life, a hidden cause of action and waits for mind to be ready for its manifestation, and since supermind acts only in spirit spirit too must be there latent, omnipresent, involved, a hidden cause of action. But spirit is not dependent on the evolution of supermind for its manifestation; it can appear to our mentality, to our life-consciousness, even to our physical mind. The true nature and rationale of this priority appear in the descending scale. There we see the true development of the universe. Spirit of self-being develops self of conscious energy which supports its self of cosmic bliss, which acts on the Ænite by su- permind, which offers its differentiations to mind, relates them in life, Æxes them phenomenally in body of material substance. This is the descending scale by which universe is created or made sensible to embodied soul. But in the material world, all is Ærst involved in matter and has to Ænd itself by a development from material being and with material being as its support and basis. The evolving process of this self-discovery of the universal existence produces the phenomenon of evolution of higher and greater from lower and lesser principles which we call the ascending scale of being. This phenomenon bafØing now to the reason becomes a self- evident proposition when we observe the descending scale and"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 313 Ænd involution to have preceded evolution. The phenomenon arises inevitably from the nature of our being. * Schema of being has to be formulated from these two points of view, the results, though data of experience, being at Ærst taken as a working hypothesis, subject to veriÆcation. We follow actu- ally the ascending scale, but the descending scale has Ærst to be shown, as otherwise the possible explanations of psychological phenomenon which result from this line of experience, would be unintelligible and would have either to be excluded or the whole enquiry restated in altered detail in the end. All questions of the reality or unreality of the world, its fundamental or ultimate purpose or want of purpose, the destiny of the soul, must be left over till the psychological data have been understood. To proceed otherwise would be to determine them by metaphysical reasoning; but the object before us is to arrive at them by the road of psychology. The whole psychology of Vedanta depends upon this double scale and without it could have no complete scientiÆc veriÆca- tion. Because it exists experience of consciousness can give a clue to the nature of world existence. Metaphysical reasoning by itself could only give us philosophical opinions, psychological veriÆcation makes Vedantic truth a Ærm guide in life. It gives us a tangible ladder of ascension by which we rise to our highest truth of being[.] 105 The knowledge at which psychology arrives in its largest gener- alisations, is that there is one absolute and indeÆnable Reality which we call for psychological purposes the Self one, indivisible and common to all existence which manifests itself with an in- Ænite variety in the universe and that every soul is an individual personality – we will use the word for want of a better – of that Self manifesting itself with a variety not precisely inÆnite,"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"314 Essays Divine and Human but indeÆnite, but in accordance with its individual nature which provides the principle of harmony, regulates the variety, casts it into a certain mould of unity. All existence is one, but with a constantly active principle of variation and individuation. There is a universal nature of things, but man while abiding within the principles of that nature, has also a nature of his own which distinguishes him from the animal and from lower forms of life. There is therefore this general individuality of Man which the totality of mankind represents in its full play of oneness and variety. Within that general individuality there are typal, racial, national, class individualities and each man has his own individual nature, one indeed in its general basis and materials with general human nature and with his type, race, class, nation, but yet possessed of its own principle of particular individuation. It is this which reigns in his mentality, vital being, physical being and stamps itself upon them, but in itself it is neither mental, vital nor physical, but proceeds from a secret principle superior to all these; mind, life and body are only means and values of his self-expression. So is it with every community, nation or other natural grouping of men. Towards a True Scientific Psychology 106 When the ancient thinkers of India set themselves to study the soul of man in themselves and others, they, unlike any other nation or school of early thought, proceeded at once to a process which resembles exactly enough the process adopted by mod- ern science in its study of physical phenomena. For their object was to study, arrange and utilise the forms, forces and working movements of consciousness, just as the modern physical Sci- ences study, arrange and utilise the forms, forces and working movements of objective Matter. The material with which they had to deal was more subtle, Øexible and versatile than the most"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 315 impalpable forces of which the physical Sciences have become aware; its motions were more elusive, its processes harder to Æx; but once grasped and ascertained, the movements of conscious- ness were found by Vedic psychologists to be in their process and activity as regular, manageable and utilisable as the movements of physical forces. The powers of the soul can be as perfectly handled and as safely, methodically and puissantly directed to practical life-purposes of joy, power and light as the modern power of electricity can be used for human comfort, industrial and locomotive power and physical illumination; but the results to which they give room and effect are more wonderful and momentous than the results of motorpower and electric lumi- nosity. For there is no difference of essential law in the physical and the psychical, but only a difference and undoubtedly a great difference of energy, instrumentation and exact process. The Supreme Existence which expresses itself equally in soul and matter, moves upon one fundamental principle on all its sevenfold levels, and even by one set of medial processes, but It varies their minute arrangement and organic functioning to suit the material which it is using and the objective which it has set before Itself in Its divine movement. Exact observation and untrammelled, yet scrupulous exper- iment are the method of every true Science. Not mere observa- tion by itself – for without experiment, without analysis and new-combination observation leads to a limited and erroneous knowledge; often it generates an empirical classiÆcation which does not in the least deserve the name of science. The old Eu- ropean system of psychology was just such a pseudo-scientiÆc system. Its observations were superÆcial, its terms and classiÆ- cation arbitrary, its aim and spirit abstract, empty and scholas- tic. In modern times a different system and method are being founded; but the vices of the old system persist. The observations made have been incoherent, partial or morbid and abnormal; the generalisations are far too wide for their meagre substratum of observed data; the abstract & scholastic use of psychological terms and the old metaphysical ideas of psychological processes still bandage the eyes of the infant knowledge, mar its truth and"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"316 Essays Divine and Human hamper its progress. These old errors are strangely entwined with a new fallacy which threatens to vitiate the whole enquiry, – the fallacy of the materialistic prepossession. 107 Psychology ought to be rather than is the science of conscious- ness and of the motions of consciousness as distinguished from the science of form and of the motions of form. We are deal- ing, therefore, in psychology with a more subtle, Øexible and versatile material than in the physical sciences; its motions are more elusive, its processes harder to Æx; but when once grasped and ascertained, its laws and activities are found to be quite as regular, manageable and utilisable as the processes of physical Nature. They give room to even more wonderful and momen- tous results. There is no difference of essential law in the physical & psychical, but a great difference of instrumentation and exact process. For the Supreme Existence moves on one fundamental principle or one set of principles in all its manifestations, but varies its organic arrangement and functioning of the principles to suit the material which It is using & the objective which It intends to reach. In both Æelds observation & experiment are the only sound foundation of knowledge. But observation without experiment leads only to a limited and erroneous science, often to an empirical system of surface rules which do not deserve the name of science at all. It is this defect which has so long kept European psychology in the status of a pseudo-science; and, even now when real observation has begun & experimentation of an elementary kind is being attempted, the vices of the perishing sci- olism mar and hamper this infant knowledge. It has not rid itself of all its old scholastic swaddling clothes; therefore it still walks on all fours and cannot yet learn to stand up erect and walk. 108 Psychology is the science of consciousness and its status and operations in Nature and, if that can be glimpsed or experienced,"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 317 its status and operations beyond what we know as Nature. It is not enough to observe and know the movements of our surface nature and the superÆcial nature of other living creatures just as it [is] not enough for Science to observe and know as electricity only the movements of lightning in the clouds or for the astronomer to observe and know only those movements and properties of the stars that are visible to the unaided eye. Here as there a whole world of occult phenomena have to be laid bare and brought under control before the psychologist can hope to be master of his province. Our observable consciousness, that which we call ourselves, is only the little visible part of our being. It is a small Æeld below which are depths and farther depths and widths and ever wider widths which support and supply it but to which it has no visible access. All that is our self, our being, – what we see at the top is only our ego and its visible nature. Even the movements of this little surface nature cannot be understood nor its true law discovered until we know all that is below or behind and supplies it – and know too all that is around it and above. For below this conscient nature is the vast Inconscient out of which we come. The Inconscient is greater, deeper, more orig- inal, more potent to shape and govern what we are and do than our little derivative conscient nature. Inconscient to us, to our surface view, but not inconscient in itself or to itself it is a sovereign guide, worker, determinant, creator. Not to know it is not to know our nether origins and the origin of the most part of what we are and do. And the Inconscient is not all. For behind our little frontal ego and nature is a whole subliminal kingdom of inner con- sciousness with many planes and provinces. There are in that kingdom many powers, movements, personalities which are part of ourselves and help to form our little surface personality and its powers and movements. This inner self, these inner persons we do not know, but they know us and observe and dictate our speech, our thoughts, feelings, doings even more directly than the Inconscient below us."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"318 Essays Divine and Human Around us too is a circumconscient Universal of which we are a portion. This Circumconscience is pouring its forces, sug- gestions, stimulus, compulsions into us at every moment of our existence. Around us is a universal Mind of which our mind is a for- mation and our thoughts, feelings, will, impulses are continually little more than a personally modiÆed reception and transcrip- tion of its thought-waves, its force-currents, its foam of emotion and sensation, its billows of impulse. Around us is a permanent universal life of which our petty Øow of life-formation that begins and ceases is only a small dynamic wave. 109 Psychology is the science of Consciousness; it is the knowledge of its nature, its processes and the aim or results of its processes, its law or laws of being, its habitat and instruments, its what, why, where, whence and whither. But what is consciousness and can there be a science of consciousness? We are not in presence of a body of concrete, visible or sensible facts, veriÆable by all, which form an in- disputable starting-point, are subject to experiment and proof, where theories can be tested at every point and discarded if they do not accord with the facts, with all the facts. The data here are subjective, Øuid, elusive. They do not subject themselves to exact instruments, can lend themselves to varying theories, do not afford proofs easily veriÆable by all. Their presentation is difÆcult and can hardly be more than scanty and often infantile in their insufÆciency. Theories are numerous, but few or none have any solidity or permanence. To understand the psychology of others we depend upon our observation of them and our own interpretation of the movements we observe and our comparison with our own psy- chological actions and reactions. But our observation is limited by the fact that what we observe is not the psychological events we wish to study but signs of speech, action, facial or bodily"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 319 expression which seem to us to indicate them; but it is still more limited by the possibility of error in our observation and still more in our interpretation. Errors of wrong attribution, exag- geration, diminution, false [?evidence], false valuation, crop up at every turn; indeed, the whole observation may be nothing but error, the interpretation purely personal and mistaken. Compar- ison with ourselves may be a fruitful fountain of mistakes; there is no doubt a general similarity in the mass of human reactions, but the differences and variations are also marked and striking; there is here no source of certitude. A direct experiential and experimental psychology seems to be demanded if psychology is to be a science and not merely a mass of elementary and superÆcial generalisations with all the rest guesswork or uncertain conclusion or inference. We must see, feel, know directly what we observe; our interpretations must be capable of being sure and indubitable; we must be able to work surely on a ground of sure knowledge. * Modern psychologists have aimed at certitude in their knowl- edge, have found it or thought they found it by mixing up psychology and physiology; our physiological processes are sup- posed to be not only the instrumentation or an instrumentation of our consciousness, but the base or constituents of our psycho- logical processes. But by this method we can only arrive at an extended physiological, not at a true psychological knowledge. We learn that there is a physical instrumentation by which phys- ical things and their contacts work upon our consciousness, reach it through the nerves and the brain and awake certain reactions in it which may however vary with the brain and the consciousness contacted; we learn that the consciousness uses certain physiological processes as well as physical means to act upon outward things and conditions; we learn too that physical conditions have an action upon our state of consciousness and its functionings.

For there they are no longer a mass of phenomena which have to be cleared up, classiÆed, organised by the per- ceptions, conceptions and relative logic of the human intellect. These perceptions, these concepts, this logic belong to an im- perfect instrument and the arrangements they make can only be provisional and, at that, onesided and only half-true or a good deal less than half-true – and even that truth is of an inferior kind, a constructed representation and not truth itself in its own nature. In fact the intellect sees only the phenomenon, it cannot go back behind it; when it tries, it only arrives at other and more occult phenomena. The truth of things can only be perceived when one gets to what may be called summarily the spiritual vision of things and even there completely only when there is not only vision but direct experience in the very substance of one's own being and all being. 111 Consciousness is not an unaccountable freak or a chance growth or a temporary accident in a material and inconscient universe. It may so appear on the surface and physical science, since by its very terms it is limited to the examination of appearances and must start from the surface phenomenon, may choose or may have no alternative but to treat it on that basis. But surface appearances are not the reality of things, they may be a part of the truth but they are not the whole reality. One must look"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 321 beyond the external appearances of things before one can know things in themselves: especially Ærst appearances are apt to be deceptive. It is not by regarding a Øash of lightning as a chance ebullition of Æery temper in a cloud that one can know the truth of electricity. We must go far and dig deep before we can get at the truth about the Force that manifested the light- ning. Consciousness may similarly appear as a phenomenon, an outbreak of sentience in the obscurity of an originally nescient being; but we must go far beyond that specious appearance if we would know the true nature and origin and discover the entire possibilities of this apparently strange and anomalous force. For anomalous it is, since it occurs in a fundamentally inconscient universe of Matter and strange and curious it is in its reactions, aberrations, workings, destiny. Physical science – and psychology in its present methods is only an extension of physical science – conducts its search into things from down upwards; it regards Matter as the foundation and the bottom of things and having searched into that foun- dation, got as it thinks to the very bottom, it believes, or once believed, it has by that very fact understood their depths, their centre, their height and top. But this is a naive error. The truth of things is in their depths or at their centre and even at their top. The truth of consciousness also is to be found at its top and in its depths or at its centre; but when we enter into the depths of consciousness or when we try to reach its centre, we go off into trance and likewise before we get to its top, we go off into trance. Our searches into Matter also are vitiated by the fact that in Matter consciousness is in a trance and gives no apparent response to our probings. In living Matter, not yet mental, still subconscious, it does give sometimes a reply, but not one that we can understand, and, as for mind in the animal, it is only consciousness half awakened out of the original trance of in- conscient Matter: even in the human being it starts from an original nescience, its expressions, its data, all that we can ordi- narily observe of it, are the movements of Ignorance fumbling for knowledge.

Only if we can get away from this imperfection and ignorance to some top of its possibilities or to its latent depths or some hidden centre, can we discover its true nature and through it the very self and reality of our being. How do we know that there is a top to consciousness or an inner centre, since these are not apparent on the face of things? By its supernormal, not its normal manifestations and phenom- ena, for the top of things is always supernormal, it is only the bottom and what is near to the bottom that are normal, at any rate to our ordinary consciousness in the material universe. Especially we can know by the supernormal becoming normal to us – by Yoga. 112 I mean by Yogic psychology an examination of the nature and movements of consciousness as they are revealed to us by the processes and results of Yoga. This deÆnition at once takes us out of the Æeld of ordinary psychology and extends the range of our observation to an im- mense mass of facts and experiments which exceed the common surface and limited range very much as the vastly extended range of observation of Science exceeds that of the common man looking at natural external phenomena only with the help [of] his unaided mind and senses. The Æeld of Yoga is practically unlimited and its processes and instrumentation have a plasticity and adaptability and power of expansion to which it is difÆcult to see or set any limit. It is true that modern psychology has probed the internal law of living matter and consciousness and arrived at results which are remarkable but limited and fundamentally inconclusive. We know from it that the movements of consciousness are affected and on a certain side determined by the functioning of the physi- cal organs. But still the nature, origin and laws of consciousness remain unknown; all that has been proved is that the body"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The Science of Consciousness 323 provides for it an engine or instrumentation for its manifestation in living physical bodies and that certain lesions, alterations or deteriorations of the engine may lead to considerable or serious results in the functioning of the embodied consciousness. This was to be expected and can at once be conceded; but there is no proof that consciousness is a function of matter or that it was originated by the chemical or biological processes of the body or that it perishes with the dissolution of life in the body. The cessation of its functioning in the body at death proves nothing, for that was to be expected whatever the origin of consciousness or its fundamental nature. Its disappearance may be a departure, a disappearance from the body, but not a disappearance from existence. It is true also that modern inquiry probing into psycholog- ical (as opposed to physiological) phenomena has discovered certain truths that are equally discovered by Yogic process, the role of the subconscient, the subliminal, double or multiple per- sonality; but its observations in these Æelds are of an extremely groping and initial character and one does not see easily how it can arrive at the same largeness of results here as in physiology, physics, chemistry or other departments of physical Science. It is only by Yoga process that one can arrive at an instru- mentation which will drive large wide roads into the psychologi- cal Unknown and not only obscure and narrow tunnels.

Even if we dive below our normal consciousness to Ænd what is there it is some aspect of the Reality into which we enter. 116 By Yoga is meant – the word is not here used in the limited sense given to it in the disputations of Pandits – the use and [? ] of certain processes of self-discipline [and] self-exercise or sponta- neous and automatic self-intensiÆcation and self-extension of the mind and whatever in us is limited and that by which we enter into a larger deeper consciousness than is ordinarily ours. This consciousness is aware of external things not only through the physical mind and senses but by other though often similar means of Mind, an inner sense or senses, an in- ner tact or feeling such as a projective or responsive awareness of things at a slight or great distance, a premonitory sense of things about to happen [or] preparing to happen, a feeling of things or persons not seen, an inner vision of physical objects and happenings not before the eye and hundreds of other phe- nomena not normal to the ordinary mind.

It is used here in the most general sense possible as a convenient name including all processes or results of processes that lead to the unveiling of a greater and inner knowledge, consciousness, experience. Any psychic discipline by which we can pass partly or wholly into a spiritual state of the consciousness, any spontaneous or systematised approach to the inner Reality or the supreme Re- ality, any state of union or closeness to the Divine, any entry into a consciousness larger, deeper or higher than the normal consciousness common to humankind, fall automatically within the range of the word Yoga. Yoga takes us from the surface into the depths of our consciousness or it admits us into its very centre; it takes us up to the hidden topmost heights of our conscious being. It shows to us the secrets of the Self and the secret of the Divine. It gives us the knowledge, the vision, the presence of the Immanent and the Cosmic and the Transcendent Reality; that is its supreme purpose. On a lower grade it gives us the key to an inner and larger consciousness that is subliminal to us and brings out its experiences, its powers and possibilities and unless we know these things the secret of Consciousness and the knowledge of our whole being must escape us. It is through this door that we pass from a nescience of our true nature into a full light of self-knowledge. But there are methods, schools, disciplines of Yoga that are turned towards one restricted aim, follow each a differ- ent path, win control of a separate province and by following that exclusive path we shall know that province of our being only or reach a single summit. It is by the integrality of Yoga that one can attain the integrality of consciousness. Our aim must be to embrace in this new knowledge all the planes of consciousness and all its summits.

It is then only that our ig- norance or a very partial and surface awareness of ourselves can be Øooded by a light of self-revelation and turn into self- knowledge. 117 Yoga is in its essence a passage from the ordinary consciousness in which we are aware only of appearances into a higher wider deeper consciousness in which we become aware of realities and of the one Reality. Not only do we become aware of it, but we can live in it and act from it and according to it instead of living in and according to the appearance of things. Yoga is a passage from ignorance to self-knowledge, from our apparent to our true being, from an outer phenomenal mental vital material life-existence to an inner spiritual existence and a spiritualised nature. By Yoga we pass from the phenomenal to the real Man, from the consciousness of our own apparent outer nature to the consciousness of our real self, Atman, an inner and in- most man, Purusha, that which we truly and eternally are. This self or true being remains constant through all the changes of our phenomenal being, changes of the mind, life or body or changes of our apparent personality; it is permanent, per- petual and immortal, a portion or manifestation of the Eter- nal. By Yoga we pass also from our consciousness of the phe- nomenal appearance or appearances of the cosmos or world around us to a consciousness of its truth and reality. We become aware of the world as a manifestation of or in universal being who is the true truth of all that we see, hear, experience. We become aware of a cosmic Consciousness which is the secret of the cosmic Energy, a cosmic Self or Spirit, the cosmic Divine, the universal Godhead. But by Yoga we become aware also that our own Self or true being is one with the cosmic Self and Spirit, our nature a play of the cosmic Nature; the wall between ourselves and the"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"The Way of Yoga 331 universe begins to disappear and vanishes altogether. We realise the selfsame Pantheos in ourselves, in others and in all universal existence. But also by Yoga we become aware of something that is more than our individual being and more than the cosmic being, a transcendent Being or Existence which is not dependent on ours or the existence of the universe. Our existence is a manifes- tation of and in that Being, the cosmos also is a manifestation of and in that one Supreme Existence. This then is the Truth or Reality to which we arrive by Yoga, a one and supreme Being or Existence and Power of Being which manifests as a cosmic Self or Spirit and a cosmic Energy or Nature and in that again as our own self or spirit which becomes aware of itself as an individual being and nature. Union: The Aim of Yoga 118 It is the aim of all Yoga to pass by a change of consciousness into the Reality that is behind things and live no longer in their appearance. To enter into some kind of union or communion or participation in that is the common object of all Yoga. But the Reality presents itself to the consciousness of man the mental being under many aspects. We seek after union or closeness to the Divine, whatever the Divine may be. We see the Divine as a personal Godhead or as an impersonal Existence. A God of Love or compassion attracts us or a God of might and power. It is a divine Friend who meets us or a Divine Mas- ter or a World Father or World Mother or an almighty Lord of all or a Divine Lover. We are in the presence of a Cosmic Spirit in whose universal consciousness we lose our separate ego or a Supracosmic Absolute in whom we lose altogether our cosmic as well as our individual existence. We Ænd our own highest Self or the Self of all or we pass into a sublime"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"332 Essays Divine and Human Mystery without relation or feature where neither self nor all can exist any longer. Or it may be the inexpressible mystery of an original Nihil that abolishes for us all suffering along with all existence – or else that Nihil may be a mystic All that is far other than the false and illusory being created for us by mind and life experience. 119 Yoga is our union with some Being or some Reality, which is greater than ourselves or is our own greatest and real Self; it is That which by Yoga we join, enter into or become. 120 All Yoga strives towards union with the Highest, the Spirit, the Self, the Divine, or whatever other name or aspect we seize of the One Eternal and InÆnite. And by union we mean, Ærst, contact constant and increas- ing with the consciousness of the Divine or InÆnite, then to assimilate it or assimilate ourselves to it, then to become not only like to it and full of it, but to enter into it and dwell in it, to become that divine consciousness and being, essence of its essence and so abolish all division that separates us from the Divinity from whom we came. 121 To be one with the Eternal is the object of Yoga; there is no other object, because all other aims are included in this one divine perfection. To be one with the Eternal is to be one with him in being, consciousness, power and delight. All that is is summed in these four terms of the inÆnite, for all else are but their workings.

These four together are one way of being and one perfection. To live in the Eternal is also to live with the Eternal within us. Whosoever consciously inhabits his being, his conscious pres- ence inhabits. God lives and moves and acts in us when we live and move and act in him[.] 122 Yoga is the contact of the humanity in us with the deity in which it dwells, of the Ænite with the InÆnite, of the as yet accomplished evolving & imperfect humanity with its yet unevolved attainable perfection, of the outwardly active waking consciousness which is controlled with the inwardly active controlling consciousness, of man with God, of the changing outward apparent ego with the secret real and immutable Self. By that contact the lower rises to the higher, the unevolved evolves, the unborn is created, human- ity assumes some part of godhead, man moves upward to God. This upward and self-expanding movement is the utility of Yoga. 123 To be one in all ways of thy being with that which is the Highest, this is Yoga. To be one in all ways of thy being with that which is the All, this is Yoga.

Yoga is the application, for this process of divine self- revelation, of the supreme force of tapas by which God created the world, supports it & will destroy it. It substitutes always some direct action of an inÆnite divine force for the limited workings of our fettered animal humanity. It uses divine means in order to rise to divinity.

The greater the union, the greater the Yoga, the more com- plete the union, the more complete the Yoga. There are different conceptions of the supreme Being and to each conception corresponds a school of Yoga with its sepa- rate idea and discipline. But these are partial and not complete systems; or rather they are complete in themselves, but do not cover the whole human being and nature. Most of them lead away from life and are useful only to the few who are moved to turn away from human existence and seek the bliss of some other state of being. To humanity at large this kind of Yoga has no real message. The complete Yoga will be one which accepts God in the world and oneness with all beings and solidarity with the human kind, Ælls life and existence with the God-consciousness and not only raises man the individual but leads man the race towards a total perfection. 127 The aim put before itself by Yoga is God; its method is tapasya. God is the All and that which exceeds & transcends the All; there is nothing in existence which is not God but God is not anything in that existence, except symbolically, in image to His own consciousness. Humanity also is a symbol or eidolon of God, we are made in His image; and by that is meant, not a formal image, but in the image of His being and personality, the essence of divinity & its quality, the divine being & divine knowledge. There are in every thing existing phenomenally or, as we shall say, symbolically, two parts, the thing in itself & the sym- bol, Self & Nature, res (thing that is) & factum (thing that is made), immutable being & mutable becoming, that which is supernatural in it & that [which] is natural. Everything in existence has something in it which seeks to transcend itself; Matter moves towards becoming Life, Life moves towards becoming Mind, Mind moves towards becoming ideal Truth, ideal Truth rises to become divine & inÆnite Spirit."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"336 Essays Divine and Human The reason is that every symbol, being a partial expression of God, reaches out to & seeks to become its own entire reality; it aspires to become its real self by transcending its apparent self. Thing that is made is attracted towards Thing that is, becoming towards being, the natural to the supernatural, symbol towards Thing in itself, Nature towards God. The upward movement is the means towards fulÆlment of existence in the world; downward movement is destruction, Hell, perdition. Everything tends [to] move upward; once it is assured of its natural existence, it seeks the supernatural. Every nature is a step towards some supernature, something natural to itself but supernatural to what is below it. Life is supernatural to Matter, Mind supernatural to Life, ideal being supernatural to mental being, inÆnite being supernatural to ideal being. So too man is supernatural to the animal, God is supernatural to man. Man too as soon as he has assured his natural existence, must insist on his upward movement towards God. The up- ward movement is towards Heaven, the downward movement towards Hell. The animal soul fulÆls itself when it transcends animality & becomes human. Humanity also fulÆls itself when it transcends humanity & becomes God. By yielding to Nature, we fall away both from Nature & from God; by transcending Nature we at once fulÆl all the possibilities of Nature & rise towards God. The human touches Ærst the divine & then becomes divine. There are those who seek to kill Nature in order to become the Self; but that is not God's intention in humanity. We have to transcend Nature, not to kill it. Every movement of humanity which seeks to destroy Na- ture, however religious, lofty or austere, of whatever dazzling purity of ethereality, is doomed to failure, sick disappointment, disillusionment or perversion.

Materialistic movements are as unnatural & abnormal as ascetic & negatory religions & philosophies. Under the pretence of bringing us back to Nature, they take us away from her en- tirely; for they forget that Nature is only phenomenally Nature but in reality she is God. The divine element in her is that which she most really is; the rest is only condition, process & stage in her development of the secret divinity. Not to be ensnared, emmeshed and bound by Nature, not to hate & destroy her, is the Ærst thing we must learn if we would be complete Yogins & proceed towards our divine perfection. Being still natural in the world to transcend Nature inter- nally so that both internally & externally we may master & use her as free & lord, swarat samrat, is our fulÆlment. Being still the symbol to reach through it the thing that symbolises itself, to realise the symbol, is our fulÆlment. Being still a Ægure of humanity, man among men, a living body among living bodies, though housed in life & matter yet a mental being among mental beings, being & remaining all this that we are apparently, yet to exceed all this apparent man- hood and become in the body what we are really, God, spirit, supreme & inÆnite, pure Bliss, pure Force, pure Light, this is our fulÆlment.

Yoga in its practice may be either perfect or partial, either selec- tive or comprehensive. Perfect and comprehensive Yoga avoids limitations by aspects and leads to entire divinity. If we are to exceed our human stature and become divine,"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"338 Essays Divine and Human we must Ærst, in our Indian phrase, get God; for this human ego is the lower imperfect term of our being, God is its higher perfect term. God in us is the possessor of our super-nature and without Him there is no effectual rising. The Ænite cannot become inÆ- nite, unless it perceives & desires to touch its own secret inÆnity; nor can the symbol-being, unless it knows, loves and pursues its Self-Reality, overcome the present limits of its merely apparent nature. This necessity is the imperative justiÆcation of religion, – not of a church, creed or theology; for these things are all outward religiosity rather than the truth of religion, but of that personal and intimate religion, a thing of temper and spirit and life, not of views or ceremonies which draws each man to his own vision of the Supreme or his own idea of something higher than himself. Without the worship of the Supreme in the heart, the aspiration towards it in the will or the thirst for it in the temperamental cravings we shall not have the impulse or the strength for the difÆcult and supreme effort demanded of us. Therefore have the prophets spoken and the Avatars descended, so that mankind may be inspired to this great call upon its upward-straining energies. The aim of rationalism & Science is to make man content with his humanity and contradict Nature, bafØing her evolution; the aim of religion, – but not unhappily of the creeds & Churches – is to farther the great aim of Nature by pushing man towards his evolution. The attainment of God is the true object of all human effort for which all his other efforts political, social, literary, intellectual, are only a necessary condition & preparation of the race; but then there are both differences in the state of the attainment, differences in its range & effectivity. Three states of divine attainment may usefully be distinguished, touch with God, indwelling in Him & becoming He. The Ærst is initial & elementary; unless passing the veil of our ordinary nature we touch the divine Being or He leaning down impose His touch [on] us, unless we come Ærst into contact with Him either in our heart, our mind, our works or our being, we cannot go on to indwell in Him. If we are strong in spirit, the touch may indeed be rapid & summary & we may wake at once & stride"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"The Way of Yoga 339 forward to the state of divine indwelling, soul of man in the soul of God, the individual in the universal; but the touch must be there. To enforce this preliminary step, to bring man into some kind of contact with God, is the common and sometimes the sole preoccupation of human religions. It does not matter greatly to Nature for her purpose how it is done, – in however crude & elementary a way, through whatever intellectual errors & emotional blunders or ethical outrages, the touch must be established; this imperatively & above all things the religious spirit demands. Nature, as is always her way, presses on to her all-important, immediate steps and is willing to purchase a single great & general gain by any number of particular losses. Man, besides, is so various in the arrangement of his human qualities, the master spring as well as the peculiar temperament differs so greatly or so subtly in each individual that there can never be, for this purpose of Nature's, too many sects, disciplines or different religions. Swami Vivekananda has well seen the consummation of religion in a state when each human individual has his own religion dictated by his own spiritual needs & nature; for collec- tive creeds, Churches & theologies, in spite of their temporary necessity & some undeniable permanent advantages, help to formalise the upward effort & deprive it of its adaptability, freedom & perfect individual sincerity. The priest & dogma will seldom leave God & the soul free to meet each other in that solitude & spontaneity which gives the union its highest force & delight. They are always pressing in to control & preside at the marriage & legitimise it with formulas, rites & ofÆcial registration. Moreover the intellect of natural man is narrow, his effort soon exhausted & easily satisÆed with imperfection. If he is led to think that his way of contact with the Divine is the only way, his own freedom of higher development is fettered or entirely taken away from him & in his intellectual & religious egoism he militates against the freedom of others. Most religions tend easily to believe that the contact with God once established, no matter with what limitations or of what kind, all is done that needs to be done, all fulÆlled that God demands of us."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"340 Essays Divine and Human Popular religions tend naturally to be dualistic and to preserve a trenchant distinction between man & God dividing the symbol being from That which expresses itself in him; while with one hand they raise man towards his super-nature, with the other they hold him down to his ordinary nature. The lower is suffused with the glow of the higher & touched with its power & rapture, but it does not itself rise into & dwell within it. At its lowest the dualistic soul cherishes the taint of its imperfections, at its highest, unless in rare self-transcending moments, keeps itself distinct in awe & reverence from the divine Lover, worships at His feet but cannot hide itself in His bosom. Therefore Nature, still following her upward surge, has pro- vided a mightier rank of human souls who are capable of going forward beyond this preliminary effort & having entered into the very being of God, of dwelling there in beatitude. Entering into the consciousness of the InÆnite, feeling it all around them & in them, ever thrilling with its touch, aware of identity with It in nature, joy and inner awareness, they yet preserve a constant separateness of their special being in that identity. They do not plunge themselves wholly into the divine ocean or, if they go down into it, they keep hold on a fathomline which will pre- serve their touch with the surface. In their nature – whatever be their opinions – such men are Visishtadwaitins, souls not drawn towards entire oneness. But unless man plunges himself wholly into God caring not whether he reemerge, unless the human sacriÆces himself wholly to the divinity, keeping back no particle of his being, not even the least particle of separateness of the individual ego, jivatman, the divine purpose in man cannot be utterly accomplished. Therefore Nature or the Will of God – for Nature is nothing but the Will of God in action – has provided that some, having indwelt in God, human soul in divine soul, shall be irresistibly called immediately, with brief respite or at long & last to the utter immersion. These go onward & throw away the last trace of Ego into God. Some of us, it has been said by a great teacher, are jivakotis, human beings leaning so preeminently to the symbol-nature that, if they have lost it utterly for a while in the Reality, they lose themselves; once"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"The Way of Yoga 341 immersed, they cannot return; they are lost in God to humanity; others are ishwarakotis, human beings whose centre has already been shifted upwards or, elevated in the superior planes of our conscious-existence from the beginning, was established in God rather than in Nature. Such men are already leaning down from God to Nature; they, therefore, even in losing themselves in Him yet keep themselves since in reaching God they do not depart from their centre but rather go towards it; arrived they are able to lean down again to humanity. Those who can thus emerge from this bath of God are the Ænal helpers of humanity & are chosen by God & Nature to prepare the type of supernatural man to which our humanity is rising. There are, then, these three divine conditions, states sep- arately conceived of humanity's God attainment. Man being limited in energy & discriminative rather than catholic in intel- lect, fastens usually on this separate conception & limits himself to one or other of these conditions; Yogic method, also, being careful of the different natures of men, suits itself to their lim- itations, becomes selective and concentrates upon one of these conditions or another. Or even it becomes partial as well as selective; for in its contact with God, it relates itself to a part of divine quality rather than the perfect divinity, to a God of mercy, the God of Justice, the Divine Master, the Divine Friend, or else with some aspect of divine impersonal being, to InÆnite Rapture, to InÆnite Force or to InÆnite Calm & Purity. In the indwelling there may be the same limitations, in the becoming also they may persist. There is no fault to be found with this selective process or with this partiality. They are necessary; human limitations demand this device; human perfectibility itself Ænds its account in these concessions. Nature knows her task & she proceeds to it with a wide, Øexible & perfect wisdom which smiles at our impa- tient logical narrownesses & rigid, onesighted consistencies. She knows she has an inÆnitely complex & variable material to deal with & must be inÆnitely complex & variable in her methods. We only consider precise method & ultimate fulÆlment; she has to reckon on her way with thousand-armed struggles & inÆnite possibilities."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"342 Essays Divine and Human Nevertheless, her ultimate aim & the perfect & comprehen- sive Yoga is that which embraces rather than selects. We are meant to be within the symbol of humanity what God is in Himself & universally. Now God is free, absolute from these limitations & all-comprehensive. He is always one in his being, yet both one with & separate from his symbols & in that dif- ferentiated oneness able to stand quite apart from them. So we too in our ultimate divine realisation when we have become one with our divine Self, may & should be able also to stand out as the self still one in all things and beings, yet differentiated in the symbol, so as to enjoy a blissful divided closeness such as that of the Lover & Beloved mingling yet separate in their rapture; & may & should even be able to stand away from God with a sort of entire separateness holding His hand still, unlike the pure dualist, but still standing away from Him so that we may enjoy that inÆnity of human relation with God which is the wonder & beauty & joy of dualistic religions. To accomplish this is the full, the purna Yoga, and the sadhak who can attain to it, is in his condition the complete Yogin. Is such a triune condition of the soul possible? Logically, it would seem impossible; logically, all trinities are chimeras and a thing must be one thing at a time & cannot combine three such divergent states as oneness, differentiated oneness & effective duality. But in these matters an inch of experience runs farther than a yard of logic, & experience, you will Ænd, afÆrms that the triune God-state is perfectly possible & simple once you have attained God's fullness. We must not apply to the soul a logic which is based on the peculiarities of matter. It is true of a clod that it cannot be at the same time a clod hanging up or pasted on some bough, a clod protruding from the earth and a shapeless mass trodden into the mother soil. But this is because the clod is divided from the earthly form. The soul is not divided from God by these barriers of material & dimension. What is true [of] matter is not true of Spirit, nor do the standards of form become facts applied to the formless.

Next be aware of that self and spirit one with thine in others. 132 All Yoga starts from the perception that what we are now or rather what we perceive as ourselves and so call is only an ignorant partial and superÆcial formulation of our nature. It is not our whole self, it is not even our real self; it is a little representative personality put forward by the true and persistent being in us for the experience of this brief life; we not only have been in the past and can be in the future but we are much more than that in the present secret totality of our being and nature. Especially, there is a secret soul in us that is our true person; there is a secret self that is our true impersonal being and spirit.

To accept nothing but the bare bliss of inÆnity is the condition of this peace. The mind escaping from itself denies all thought, all form-making, all motion or play of any kind; for that would be a grievous return to itself, a miserable imprisonment and renewed hard-labour. The life released from the toil of labouring and striving and living, demands only immobility and no more to be, a sleep of force, the surety and rest of an immutable status. The body accepts denial and dissolution, for to be dissolved is to cease to breathe and suffer. A bodiless, lifeless, mindless inÆnite breadth and supreme silence shows to us that we are in contact with the Absolute. 134 This method of extinction is imposed on our mind and our mental ego, because all that is eternal, inÆnite, absolute is su- perconscient to mind; mind and its ego cannot remain awake in that greater consciousness, they must disappear. But if we can change or evolve from mental into supramental beings, then the superconscient becomes our normal consciousness. We can then hope to wake in That and not fall asleep in it, to grow into it and not abolish ourselves in it, to last in identity and not lose ourselves in identity with the supreme Existence. 135 It is possible for the reason, the thinker in us to rest and cease satisÆed in this sole spiritual experience and to discard all others on the ground that they are in the end illusory or of a mi- nor phenomenal signiÆcance.

The heart remains atrophied and unfulÆlled; the will is baulked of its last dynamic signiÆcances. These too tend towards an absolute, the heart towards an absolute of ineffable Love and Bliss, the will towards an absolute of ineffable Power. And there is nothing to prove that the knowledge at which the reason arrives is alone true. There is no reason to suppose that the heart and will and the deeper soul within us have not too their own sufÆcient doors opening upon the Supreme, their key to the mystery of the Eternal. Bhakti Yoga: The Yoga of Devotion 136 The integral Yoga of Devotion proceeds through seven stages each of which opens out from the one that precedes it: Aspiration and self-consecration; devotion; adoration and worship; love; possession of the whole being and life by the Divine; joy of the Divine Love and the beauty and sweetness of the Divine; the absolute Bliss of the Absolute. Faith is our Ærst need; for without faith in the Divine, in the existence and the all-importance of the Divine Being there can be no reason to aspire or to consecrate, there can be no power in the aspiration or force behind the consecration.

Do not imagine that works are in their nature nothing but a bondage, they can be a powerful means towards liberation and divine perfection. All depends on the spirit in our works and their orientation towards the inner and the higher Light away from desire and ego. Works are a bondage when they are done out of desire or for the sake of the ego, by a mind turned outwards, involved in the act and not detached and free, bound to the ignorance of this lower nature. 139 To create the union of his soul with the Divine Presence and Power through a perfect surrender of the will in all his activities, is the high aspiration of the seeker on the Way of Works. To put off like a worn-out disguise the ignorant conscious- ness and stumbling will that are ours in our present mind and life-force and to put on the light and knowledge, the purity and power, the tranquillity and ecstasy of the divine Essence, the spiritual Nature that awaits us when we climb beyond mind, is the victory after which he reaches.

The ideals created by the mind are constructions in the air that have no sufÆcient foundation in our vital and physical na- ture; therefore they can change a side of our mind and colour a part of our actions, but they cannot transform our lives, cannot Ænd here their physical body. Ideals touch and pass, mankind remains the same; after religions, ideals, moralities without end we keep always the same ignorant and imperfect human nature. Moral rules and ideals are a harness for the ignorant soul, bridle and bit for the passions, reins that compel it to an assigned road, yoke and poles and traces that bind it to be faithful to the burden it carries. Morality checks and controls but does not purify or change the vital nature. In ethics there is an artiÆcial shaping of the mind's surfaces, but no spiritual freedom, no satisfying perfection of the whole dynamic nature. The mind's ideals like the life's seekings are at once absolute each in its own demand and in conØict with one another; neither mind nor life knows the means either of their complete or their harmonised fulÆlment. The mind labours through the centuries but human nature remains faithful to its imperfections and man's life amid its changes always the same.

To bring about the conditions in which alone this vast and happy identity becomes possible and to work out the lines we must follow to their end if we are to reach it, is all the deeper purpose of this discipline. The Ærst condition is the elimination of personal vital desire, for if desire intervenes, all harmony with the supreme Divine Will becomes impossible. Even if we receive it, we shall disÆgure its working and distort its dynamic impulse. To give up all desire, all insistence upon fruit and reward and success must be renounced from our will and all vital attachment to the work itself excised from our nature; for attachment makes it our own and no longer the Godhead's. The elimination of egoism is the second condition, not only of the rajasic and tamasic egoisms that twine around desire, but of the sattwic egoism that takes refuge in the idea of the I as the worker. The ordinary consciousness of man cannot accept this difÆcult renunciation or, if it accepts it, cannot achieve this tremendous change.

Only by a growth into a greater superhuman and supramental consciousness whose very nature is to be attuned to the Divine can we achieve the true and supreme Karma Yoga. This transformation is only possible after certain steps of a divine ascent have been mastered and to climb these steps is the object of the Yoga of Works as it is conceived by the Gita. The extirpation of desire, a wide and calm equality of the mind, the life soul and the spirit, annihilation of the ego, an inner quietude and expulsion or transcendence of ordinary Nature, the Nature of the three gunas and a total surrender to the Supreme are the successive steps of this preliminary change. Only after all this has been done, can we live securely in an inÆnite consciousness not bound like our mental human nature. And only then can we receive the Light, know perfectly the will of the Supreme, attune all our movements to the rhythm of its Truth and execute per- fectly from moment to moment its imperative commandments. Till then there is no Ærm achievement, but only an endeavour, seeking and aspiration, all the stress and struggle of a great and uncertain spiritual adventure.

To work in obedience to a divine command, an eternal Will, a transcendent and universal impulsion, not to run under the whips of ego and need and passion and desire, and not to be goaded by the pricks of mental and vital and physical preference, but to be moved by God only, by the highest Truth only, this is Karmayoga.

Still even what can be done within the limits of our human consciousness brings a great liberation. But even to do that little is not easy to the physical mind of man, even when his higher mind and will consent and demand it.

God is possessed; the world is not renounced or rather renounced as an aim in itself, but pos- sessed as the play of God. A selØess and transcendent perfection in the divine existence is the goal in this path of Yoga. 145 There are many Yogas, many spiritual disciplines, paths towards liberation and perfection, Godward ways of the spirit.

This is the object, but in the method also there is the same integrality, for the entirety of the object cannot be accomplished without an entirety in the method, a complete turning, open- ing, self-giving of our being and nature in all its parts, ways, movements to that which we realise.

This is the character of the integral Yoga. 151 The integral Yoga is a single but many-sided way of the growth of our spirit and development of our nature. A total experience and a single and all embracing realisation of the integral Divine Reality is its consequence. There is too implied in it a radical change and transformation of the whole being and of every part of the nature.

To reach to this union or come by this contact it is necessary to enter or at least open into a greater consciousness than that of the human mental being who is shut up in the limitations of an individualised living body.

It is inevitable therefore that our spiritual experience should be not that of a concrete integrality of this Absolute or InÆnite, but of aspects of it; we are, so long at least as we are mental beings, the blind men of the story trying to tell what the Elephant InÆnite is in its totality by our touch upon a part of it, some member of its spiritual body, tanum svam. One experiences it as Self or Spirit. It may be a Self of himself in which he Ænds his spiritual consummation, integrality, inÆnity, perfection. It may be a Self of the universe in which his individuality loses itself forever. It may be a Self transcendent in which the Ego disappears, but cosmos too is annulled forever in a formless Eternal and InÆnite. Another may experience it as God; and God may be either the All of the Pantheist, a cosmic Spirit, an individual Deity, a supracosmic Creator; or all of these together. A Personal Godhead may be the spiritual Form in which He presents Himself to us or rather He may reject forms from his being [and] resolve Himself into an impersonal Existence.

But this greater consciousness is differently conceived by different seekers, for in itself it is to the mind unseizably inÆ- nite.

Asceticism is not the Ænal condition or characteristic means of this Yoga, although it does not ex- clude, whenever that is needful ascetic self-mastery or ascetic endeavour. To become one in our absolute being with the ineffable Divine and in the manifestation a free movement of his being, power, consciousness and self-realising joy, to grow into a divine Truth- consciousness beyond mind, into a Light beyond all human or earthly lights, into a Power to which the greatest strengths of men are a weakness, into the wisdom of an infallible gnosis and the mastery of an unerring and unfailing divinity of Will, into a Bliss beside which all human pleasure is as the broken reØection of a candle-Øame to the all-pervading splendour of an imperishable sun, but all this not for our own sake [but] for the pleasure of the Divine Beloved, this is the goal and the crown of the supramental path of Yoga. This change is a thing in Nature and not out of Nature; it is not only possible, but for the growing soul inevitable. It is the goal to which Nature in us walks through all this appearance of ignorance, error, suffering and weakness. 159 The supramental Yoga is at once an ascent of the soul towards God and a descent of the Godhead into the embodied nature. The ascent demands a one-centred all-gathering aspiration"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Integral Yoga 365 of soul and mind and life and body upward, the descent a call of the whole being towards the inÆnite and eternal Divine. If this call and this aspiration are there and if they grow constantly and seize all the nature, then and then only its supramental transformation becomes possible. There must be an opening and surrender of the whole nature to receive and enter into a greater divine consciousness which is there already above, behind and englobing this mortal half- conscious existence. There must be too an increasing capacity to bear an ever stronger and more insistent action of the divine Force, till the soul has become a child in the hands of the inÆnite Mother. All other means known to other Yoga can be used and are from time to time used as subordinate processes in this Yoga too, but they are impotent without these greater conditions, and, once these are there, they are not indispensable. In the end it will be found that this Yoga cannot be carried through to its end by any effort of mind, life and body, any human psychological or physical process but only by the action of the supreme Shakti. But her way is at once too mysteriously direct and outwardly intricate, too great, too complete and sub- tle to be comprehensively followed, much more to be cut out and deÆned into a formula by our human intelligence. Man cannot by his own effort make himself more than man, but he can call down the divine Truth and its power to work in him. A descent of the Divine Nature can alone divinise the human receptacle. Self-surrender to a supreme transmuting Power is the key-word of the Yoga. This divinisation of the nature of which we speak is a meta- morphosis, not a mere growth into some kind of superhumanity, but a change from the falsehood of our ignorant nature into the truth of God-nature. The mental or vital demigod, the Asura, Rakshasa and Pishacha, – Titan, vital giant and demon, – are superhuman in the pitch and force and movement and in the make of their characteristic nature, but these are not divine and those not supremely divine, for they live in a greater mind power or life power only, but they do not live in the supreme Truth, and only the supreme Truth is divine. Only those who live in a"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"366 Essays Divine and Human supreme Truth consciousness and embody it are inwardly made or else remade in the Divine image. The aim of supramental Yoga is to change into this supreme Truth-consciousness, but this truth is something beyond mind and this consciousness is far above the highest mind-conscious- ness. For truth of mind is always relative, uncertain and partial, but this greater Truth is peremptory and whole. Truth of mind is a representation, always an inadequate, most often a misleading representation, and even when most accurate, only a reØection, Truth's shadow and not its body. Mind does not live in the Truth or possess but only seeks after it and grasps at best some threads from its robe; the supermind lives in Truth and [is] its native substance, form and expression; it has not to seek after it, but possesses it always automatically and is what it possesses. This is the very heart of the difference. The change that is effected by the transition from mind to supermind is not only a revolution in knowledge or in our power for knowledge. If it is [to] be complete and stable, it must be a divine transmutation of our will too, our emotions, our sensations, all our power of life and its forces, in the end even of the very substance and functioning of our body. Then only can it be said that the supermind is there upon earth, rooted in its very earth-substance and embodied in a new race of divinised creatures. Supermind at its highest reach is the divine Gnosis, the Wisdom-Power-Light-Bliss of God by which the Divine knows and upholds and governs and enjoys the universe[.] 160 The supramental Yoga is a path of integral seeking of the Divine by which all that we are is in the end liberated out of the Igno- rance and its undivine formations into a truth beyond the Mind, a truth not only of highest spiritual status but of a dynamic spiritual self-manifestation in the universe.

It is by a will to give oneself to the eternal Divine, for lifting into the divine consciousness, for perfection, for transformation, that the Yoga begins; it is in the entire giving that it culminates; for it is only when the self-giving is complete that there comes the Ænality of the Yoga, the entire taking up into the supramental Divine, the perfection of the being, the transformation of the nature. The Yoga of Transformation 163 This is a Yoga of transformation of the being, not solely a Yoga of the attainment of the inner Self or the Divine, though that"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"368 Essays Divine and Human attainment is its basis without which no transformation is pos- sible. In this transformation there are four elements, the psychic opening, the transit through [the] occult, the spiritual release, the supramental perfection. If any of the four is unachieved, the Yoga remains incomplete. I mean by the psychic the inmost soul-being and the soul nature. This is not the sense in which the word is used in ordinary parlance, or rather, if it is so used, it is with great vagueness and much misprision of the true nature of this soul and it is given a wide extension of meaning which carries it far beyond that province. All phenomena of an abnormal or supernormal psy- chological or an occult character are dubbed psychic; if a man has a double personality changing from one to another, if an apparition of a dying man, something of his mere vital sheath or else a thought-form of him, appears and stalks through the room of his wondering friend, if a poltergeist kicks up an unseemly row in a house, all that is classed under psychic phenomena and regarded as a Æt object for psychic research, though these things have nothing whatever to do with the psyche. Again much in Yoga itself that is merely occult, phenomena of the unseen vital or mental or subtle physical planes, visions, symbols, all that mixed, often perturbed, often shadowy, often illusory range of experiences which belong to this intervening country between the soul and its superÆcial instruments or rather to its outermost fringes, all the chaos of the intermediate zone, is summed up as psychic and considered as an inferior and dubious province of spiritual discovery. Again there is a constant confusion between the mentalised desire-soul which is a creation of the vital urge in man, of his life-force seeking for its fulÆlment and the true soul which is a spark of the Divine Fire, a portion of the Divine. Because the soul, the psychic being uses the mind and the vital as well as the body as instruments for growth and experience it is itself looked at as if it were some amalgam or some subtle substratum of mind and life. But in Yoga if we accept all this chaotic mass as soul-stuff or soul-movement we shall enter into a confusion without an issue.

It is something that once it is released from obscuration by its instruments at once creates a direct contact with the Divine and with the self and spirit. 164 In the integral Yoga there is a progressive discovery of our spiritual status; this progression is accompanied by a dynamic new-creation of our nature. A triple transformation is its process and the revelation of its entire signiÆcance. A Ærst discovery is the unveiling of the soul out of its dis- guising mask, concealing curtain, blockading wall of mind, life and body – the psychic entity, the divine element in our nature which gives it its permanence and immortality, becomes the open ruler of our instruments and transmutes them into con- scious spiritualised agents so that they are no longer a changing formulation of the nature of the Ignorance. 165 Yoga is not only a discovery of our concealed spiritual status but a dynamic spiritual self-creation; a triple transformation is the heart of its process and the revelation of its entire signiÆcance. Its Ærst step is the unveiling of the soul; 1 for there [is a] secret psychic being, a divine element in our depths that is concealed even more than garbed by the mind, body and life. To bring it 1 Reproduced below is another, incomplete version of this passage: Its Ærst step is the unveiling of the soul, the psychic entity, now covered by the superÆcial activity of mind and life and body. The soul is the deep hidden natural divine element in us, a permanent portion of the Godhead which persists in a spiritual permanence and ensures our immortality of being; for without it there could be only a temporary mechanical formation and action of nature-energy and its phenomenon of substance. This unveiling is accompanied by a psychic transformation of the nature; mind, life and body become truly ensouled and ready for a spiritual change. Its second step is the revelation of a self and spirit which supports our individual soul manifestation and soul development, but knows itself to be one being with cosmic Godhead and universal Nature and can stand back from that even as a transcendent spirit. By this discovery the being in us exceeds its separate individuality, enters into a cosmic consciousness, is released into a supracosmic transcendence."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"370 Essays Divine and Human out of its seclusion where it lives like a spiritual king without apparent power served and replaced by its ministers, so that it may take over the whole active government of the nature is the Ærst great unfolding, the initial potent self-discovery of the Yoga. Mind the thinker is the prime minister in us who covers the king, but mind too is dominated and led by the vital powers, the strong and violent of the realm, who force it to serve their purpose and these too can only act with the means given them by the body and physical nature, the inert hardly conscious subject existence whose passive assent and docile instrumentation is yet indispensable to its rulers. This is our present constitution and it amounts to no more than a sort of organised confusion, a feudal order that is an ignorant half anarchy and cannot make the most of the possibilities and resources even of the limited tract of nature which we inhabit, much less reveal to us and exploit our spiritual empire. To reinstate the king-soul is the Ærst step in a needed revolution – the soul directing the mind will exercise through it its sovereign power over the powers of life and subject to them in their turn an enlightened and psychically consenting body. But this is not all; for soul-discovery is not complete without a psychic new creation of the mental, vital and physical instrumentation of nature. The mind will be recast by the soul's intuition of Truth, the vital being by its perception of power and good, the body and whole nature by its command for light, harmony and beauty. Our nature will become that of a true psychic entity, not a brute creation uniÆed by a precarious life and illumined by the candlelight of a struggling intelligence. 166 I mean by the integral Yoga a manysided way or means of self- liberation and self-perfection, a radical change of our entire being by which we grow out of its present mental, vital and physical human ignorance into a large and integral spiritual and divine Consciousness; – as a result of this liberation, this change or transformation there is a union in the spirit with our Divine Origin in its integral Reality, an ascent of all our being"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Integral Yoga 371 and nature into the Divine Existence, the Divine Consciousness, the Divine Bliss or Ananda, and a descent of the Divine inÆnite Wideness, Light, Knowledge, Force, Joy, Ananda into our entire nature. 167 Our Yoga is a Yoga of transformation, but a transformation of the whole consciousness and the whole nature from the top to the bottom, from its hidden inward parts to its most tangible external movements. It is neither an ethical change nor a reli- gious conversion, neither sainthood nor ascetic control, neither a sublimation nor a suppression of the life and vital movements that we envisage, nor is it either a gloriÆcation or a coercive control or rejection of the physical existence. What is envisaged is a change from a lesser to a greater, from a lower to a higher, from a surface to a deeper consciousness – indeed to the largest, highest, deepest possible and a total change and revolution of the whole being in its stuff and mass and every detail into that yet unrealised diviner nature of existence. It means a bringing forward of what is now hidden and subliminal, a growing con- scious in what is now superconscient to us, an illumination of the subconscient and subphysical. It implies a substitution of the control of the nature by the soul for its present control by the mind; a transference of the instrumentation of the nature from the outer to the now more than half-veiled inner mind, from the outer to the inner vital or life-self, from the outer to an inner subtler vaster physical consciousness and by this transference a direct and conscious instead of an indirect and unconscious or half conscious contact with the secret cosmic forces that move us; a breaking out from the narrow limited individual into a wide cosmic consciousness; an ascension from mental to spiritual nature; a still farther ascension from the spirit in mind or overspreading mind to the supramental spirit and a descent of that into the embodied being.

Something will be born that was not here or was latent and hidden in its own invisible radiances and at the same time there will be a metamorphosis and reversal in our existing structure. A creation by a consensus of superior and nether powers is the condition demanded by the Spirit for its decisive works; and this double action, this meeting, consensus, uniÆcation of the su- perconscient and subconscient gods in a growing consciousness is the key to the critical revolutions of Nature. The creation of conscious supermind on the terrestrial plane will be done therefore not only from above by the Spirit but from below by the Earth-Power.

Like all superstitions this belief is founded on bad and imperfect ob- servation Øowering into a logical fallacy. Our observation is necessarily imperfect because we have at our disposal the his- torical data and literary records of only a few millenniums and beyond only disjected and insufÆcient indices which leave gigan- tic room for the hardly-fettered activity of the mind's two chief helpers and misleaders, inference and conjecture. Our observa- tion is bad because, prepossessed by the Æxed idea of a brief & recent emergence from immemorial barbarism, imagining Plato to have blossomed in a few centuries out of a stock only a little more advanced than the South Sea islander, we refuse to seek in the records that still remain of a lost superior knowledge their natural and coherent signiÆcance; we twist them rather into the image of our own thoughts or conÆne them within the still narrow limits of what we ourselves know and understand.

The time-limit allowed for the growth of civilisation is still im- possibly short and in consequence an air of unreality hangs over the application of the evolutionary idea to our human develop- ment. Nor is this essential objection cured by any evidence of the modernity of human civilisation. Its great antiquity is denied merely on the absence [of] afÆrmative data; there are no positive indications to support the denial; but where data are scanty, such a negative basis is in the last degree unsound and precarious. We can no longer argue that no ancient civilisations can have existed of which the traces have entirely perished and that prehistoric means, necessarily, savage and undeveloped.

Brief lapse of time is not indeed the cardinal point of the savage theory and even if larger time-spaces are allowed, the theory itself need not fall. But I have urged the question of time as of primary moment not for the overthrow of the modern explanation but for the readmission of another and more an- cient synthesis. For if once we allow the existence of prehistoric civilisations older, it would seem, than the Egyptian, – such as may be argued from the deep-buried cities of Asia, – and the presence in an unknown antiquity of great national cultures where now the savage or the semi-savage swarm uncreative and unreØecting, – such as may be argued from the ruins of Mashonaland or the state of mediaeval Barbary after the ravages of Moor and Vandal or even the fate which overtook for almost a millennium the magniÆcent structure of Graeco-Roman culture and threatened even to blot out its remnants and ruins, – the question then arises, what was the nature of these forgotten civilisations and how was the relapse to barbarism often of an extreme form, so completely effected. These gigantic spaces of time, this worldwide rise and fall of human society, this swaying to and fro from darkness to light and light to darkness leave the ground open for another explanation which is in some respects the reverse of the savage theory, – for the Hindu explanation. For the Hindu mind has never admitted the principle in Nature of progress in a straight line. Progress in a straight line only appears to occur and so appears only because we concen- trate our scrutiny on limited sections of the curve that Nature is following. But if we stand away from this too near and detailed scrutiny and look at the world in its large masses, we perceive that its journeying forward has no straightness in it of any kind but is rather effected in a series of cycles of which the net result is progress. The image of this apparent straight line is that of the ship which seems to its crew to be journeying on the even plain of the waters but is really describing the curve of the earth in a way perceptible only to a more distant and instructed vision. Moreover even the small section of the curve which we are"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"384 Essays Divine and Human examining & which to our limited vision seems to be a straight line is the result of a series of zigzags and is caused by the conØict of forces arriving by a continual struggle at a continual compromise or working out by their prolonged discord a tem- porary harmony. The image of the actual progress in cycles is the voyaging in Space of the planets which describe always the same curve round their Øaming & luminous sun, image of the perfect strength, joy, beauty, beneÆcence and knowledge towards which our evolution yearns. The cycle is always the same ellipse, yet by the simultaneous movement of the whole system the completed round Ænds the planet at a more advanced station in Space than its preceding journey. It is in this way, by an ever-swaying battle, a prodigal destruction and construction, a labouring forward in ever-progressing curves and ellipses that Nature advances to her secret consummation. These are the conceptions we Ænd expressed in the Puranic symbols familiar to our imagination. There is the Kalpa of a thousand ages with its term of fourteen Manwantaras dividing a sub-cycle of a hundred chaturyugas; there is the dharma, the well-harmonised law of being, perfect in the golden period of the Satya, impaired progressively in bronze Treta and copper Dwapara, collapsing in the iron Kali only to open the way by its disintegration to the manifestation in the next Satya of the old law, truth or natural principle of existence arranged in a new harmony. There is throughout this zigzag, this rhythm of rise and fall and rise again brought about by the struggle of up- ward, downward and stationary forces. There are the alternate triumphs of deva and daitya, helping god and opposing or too violently forward-striving Titan; – the dharmasya glani and ab- hyutthanam adharmasya, when harmony is denied and discord or wrong harmony established, and then the Avatara and the dharmasya sansthapanam, eternal Light and Force descending, restoring, effecting a new temporary adjustment of the world's ways to the truth of things and of man.

In certain respects the old Vedantic thinkers anticipate us; they agree with all that is essential in our modern ideas of evolution. From one side all forms of creatures are developed; some kind of physical evolution from the animal to the human body is ad- mitted in the Aitareya. The Taittiriya suggests the psychological progress of man, and the psychological progress of race cannot be different in principle from the evolution of the individual – a proceeding from the material, the emotionally and mentally inert man upwards [?through] the mental to [?our] spiritual ful- Ælment. The Puranas admit the creation of animal forms before the appearance of man and in the symbol of the Ten Avatars trace the growth of our evolution from the Æsh through the animal, the man-animal and the developed human being to the differ- ent stages of our present incomplete evolution. But the ancient Hindu, it is clear, envisaged this progression as an enormous secular movement covering more ages than we can easily count. He believed that Nature has repeated it over & over again, as indeed it is probable that she has done, resuming brieØy & in sum at each start what she had previously accomplished in detail, slowly & with labour. It is this great secular movement in cycles, perpetually self-repeating, yet perpetually progressing, which is imaged and set forth for us in the symbols of the Puranas. It is for this reason that he assigned to his civilisation those immense eras and those ancient and far backward beginnings which strike the modern as so incredible.

Much water has Øown under the bridges since Herodotus wrote and in this respect Asia seems not only to have infected Europe with this ™barbaric∫ trait of manners, but to have been far outstripped by her pupil in the development of sartorial superØuities. Excessive wealth and gorgeous splendour was also quoted as a characteristic of Asiatic barbarism from the time of the classical poets. Europe has seen to it that this charge shall only apply now in a very minimum quantity to the eastern continent. Asia now stands, not only by choice of her ascetics, but by economic compulsion for the simple life, and the ostentation of wealth which was once depreciated as a sign of oriental barbarism now parades itself, much vulgarised, at least to our barbaric eastern notion of aesthetics as the splendid face of occidental civilisation.

The process is far from complete, but the broad lines of the plan laid down by the great ArtiÆcer of things already begin to appear. For a time this uniÆcation was applied to Europe only. Asia had its own triune civilisation, predominatingly spiritual, complex and meditative in India, predominatingly vital, emotional, active and simplistic in the regions of the Hindu Kush and Mesopotamia, predominatingly intellectual, mechanical and organised in the Mongolian em- pires. East, West and South had their widely separate spirit and traditions, but one basis of spirituality, common tendencies and such commerce of art, ideas and information as the difÆculties of communication allowed, preserved the fundamental unity of Asia. East & West only met at their portals, in war oftener than in peace and through that shock and contact inØuenced but did not mingle with each other. It was the discovery of Indian philosophy and poetry which broke down the barrier. For the Ærst time Europe discovered something in the East which she could study not only with the curiosity which she gave to Semitic and Mongolian ideas and origins, but with sympathy and even with some feeling of identity. This metaphysics, these epics and dramas, this formulated jurisprudence and complex society had methods and a form which, in spite of their diversity from her own, yet presented strong points of contact; she could recognise them, to a certain extent she thought she could understand.

There was indeed a single exception which remarkably illustrates the difÆculty of which I speak. The art of India contradicted European notions too vitally to be admitted into the European consciousness; its charm and power were concealed by the uncouthness to Western eyes of its form and the strangeness of its motives and it is only now, after the greatest of living art-critics in England had published sympathetic appreciations of Indian art and energetic propagandists like Mr. Havell had persevered in their labour, that the European vision is opening to the secret of Indian painting & sculpture. But the art of Japan presented certain outward characteristics on which the European could readily seize. Japanese painting had already begun to make its way into Europe even before the victories of Japan and its acceptance of much of the outward circumstances of European civilisation opened a broad door into Europe for all in Japan that Europe can receive without unease or the feeling of an incompatible strangeness. Japanese painting, Japanese dress, Japanese deco- ration are not only accepted as a part of Western life by the select few and the cultured classes but known and allowed, without being adopted, by the millions. Asiatic civilisation has entered into Europe as deÆnitely though not so victoriously as European civilisation into Asia. It is only the beginning, but so was it only the beginning when a few scholars alone rejoiced in the clarity of Buddhistic Nihilism, Schopenhauer rested his soul on the Upanishads and Emerson steeped himself in the Gita. No one could have imagined then that a Hindu monk would make converts in London and Chicago or that a Vedantic temple would be built in San Francisco and Anglo- Saxon Islamites erect a Musulman mosque in Liverpool.

In Europe except in its one Asiatic corner there has been no event of corresponding magnitude & importance. The abortive orgy of revolutionary fury in Russia, the growth of enormous strikes, the failure of the peace movement, the increase of legislation stamped with the pressure of a materialistic Socialism, although they may hold in themselves germs of greater things, are so far mere indistinct material symptoms of disorganisation & a disease vainly doctored with palliatives, not events of a deÆnite movement of new birth & regeneration.

Every new awakening of the kind comes by some impact slight or great on the national consciousness which puts it in face of new ideas, new conditions, new needs, the necessity of readaptation to a changing environment. The spirit of the nation has to take account of its powers and possibilities and is stirred by a will to new formation and new creation. The change does not always amount to a renascence. But the impact in which we live at the present hour is nothing less than that of a new world. It is not merely the pressure of the whole Western civilisation upon the ancient spirit of the East or of modernism on a great traditional civilisation, but it is a great worldwide change, an approaching new birth of mankind itself of which the change in us is only a part. Therefore the result that we are face to face with, is a renascence, the birth of the Spirit into a new body, new forms in society and politics, new forms of literature, art, science, philos- ophy, action and creation of all kinds. And the question arises what in the great play of modiÆcation and interchange around us are we going to take from the world around us, how are we going to shape [it] in the stress of our own spirit and past traditions, and what are we going to bring out of ourselves and impress upon the world in exchange?

From the less worldwide viewpoint which most nearly concerns us in this country, we may say, that we Ænd ourselves in a great hour of rebirth of the ancient soul of India. The momentous issues of this hour are producing their inevitable upheaval, change and effort at creation in the whole national life, politics, society, economical conditions, industry, commerce, as well as and more noisily than in literature. But it is perhaps in art, literature and science that the future will see what was most deÆnitive in the creations of the present hour, the most signiÆcant thing in the Indian renascence; for these things reveal most freely the spirit which is coming to birth; they have found their Æeld, discovered their motive; the rest is still only a primary effort to escape out of unnatural conditions; the Æeld has there yet to be made clear, before the struggling spiritual motive can make itself dominant and create its appropriate forms. Especially, is the movement of literature most revelatory; for while music and art reveal perhaps more absolutely the soul of a nation, literature is the whole expression of its mind and psychology, – not only of what it is in action, or what it is in essence, but its thought, character and aspiration.

Ages of accomplished intellectuality & scholarship or of strong sci- entiÆc rationality are not favourable to the birth of great poets or, if they are born, not favourable to the free & untrammelled action of their gifts. They remain great, but their greatness bends under a load; there is a lack of triumphant spontaneity and they do not draw as freely or directly from the sources of human action & character. An untameable elemental force is needed to overcome more than partially the denials of the environment. For poetry, even though it appeals in passing to the intellect & aesthetic sense, does not proceed from them but is in its nature an elemental power proceeding from the secret & elemental Power within which sees directly & creates sovereignly, & it passes at once to our vital & elemental parts.

These are the voices of the poets. We whose souls are drying up in this hard and parched age of utilitarian and scientiÆc thought when men value little beyond what gives them exact and useful knowledge or leads them to some outward increase of power & pleasure, we who are beginning to neglect & ignore poetry and can no longer write it greatly & well, – just as we have forgotten how to sculpture like the Greeks, paint like the mediaeval Italians or build like the Buddhists, – are apt to forget this grand utility of the poets, one noble faculty among their many divine and unusual powers. The kavi or vates, poet & seer, is not the manishi; he is not [the] logical thinker, scientiÆc analyser or metaphysical reasoner; his knowledge is one not with his thought, but with his being; he has not arrived at it but has it in himself by virtue of his power to become one with all that is around him. By some form of spiritual, vital and emotional oneness, he is what he sees; he is the hero thundering in the forefront of the battle, the mother weeping over her dead, the tree trembling violently in the storm, the Øower warmly penetrated with the sunshine. And because he is these things, therefore he knows them; because he knows thus, spiritually & not rationally, he can write of them. He feels their delight & pain, he shares their virtue & sin, he enjoys their reward or bears their punishment. It is for this reason that poetry written out of the intellect is so inferior to poetry written out of the soul, is, – even as poetical thinking, – so inferior to the thought that comes formed by inscrutable means out of the soul.

They have been too easily attracted by the materials of poetry, artha & shabda; drawn by some power & charm in the substance of speech, captivated by some melody, harmony or colour in the form of speech, arrested by some strong personal emotion which clutches at expression or gropes for expression in these externals of poetry they have forgotten to bathe in the Muse's deepest springs. Therefore among those ancient voices, even when the liter- ature of the ages has been winnowed & chosen by Time, there are very few who recreate for us in poetic speech deeply & mightily the dead past, because they were that past, not so much themselves as the age & nation in which they lived and not so much even the age and nation as that universal humanity which in spite of all differences, under them and within them, even expressing its unity through them is the same in every nation and in every age. Others give us only fragments of thought or outbursts of feeling or reveal to us scattered incidents of sight, sound and outward happening.

For, being alone existent, He is irresponsible and the har- monies He creates, are the Ægment of His own plastic will and governed by laws of aesthetics determined in His own unfettered but infallible fantasy. Out of His inÆnite personality He creates all these characters & their inevitable actions & destinies. So it is with every divine creator, – with Homer, Shakespeare, Valmiki, Kalidasa. It is perfectly true that each has his own style of lan- guage & creation, his own preferred system or harmony of the poetic Art, just as the creator of this universe has fashioned it in a particular style & rhythm & on certain preferred & Æxed canons, differing from that of the other universes He may have built in His inÆnite Being.

If the mentality remained too pragmatic, too eager to rationalise or organise life according to the idea, the peril of mechanisation and standardisation would be there. If the mental ideas governing the individual and social life took a settled form, became a cultural system of the mind, this system would after a time exhaust its possibilities and human life would settle down into a groove, satisÆed and non-evolutive, as happened in the Graeco-Roman world or in China or elsewhere where the mental intellect became the predominant power of life. If this arrest were avoided either by the multiplication of different cultures – different peoples acting upon each other but escaping the ten- dency to replication and standardisation which is the tendency of the human collective mind or by a free progressiveness of the human intelligence making constantly new ideas, new ideals, still the movement would eventually be in a circle or an ellipsis which could be a constant description of a new-old movement in the same Æeld. In fact our external mind moving on the surface tends always to exhaust itself rapidly; if it expends itself slowly, conservatively, at a leisurely pace, it can create a civilisation and culture which will last for centuries or even for one or more thousands of years; but that too will exhaust itself in time; if it throws itself into a brilliant or rapid movement as in ancient Greece or in modern Europe a few centuries are likely to see the end of this Øaming up as of a new star.

O Misfortune, blessed be thou; for through thee I have seen the face of my Lover. 36. Men are still in love with grief; when they see one who is too high for grief or joy, they curse him & cry, ™O thou insensi- ble!∫ Therefore Christ still hangs on the cross in Jerusalem. 37. Men are in love with sin; when they see one who is too high for vice or virtue, they curse him & cry, ™O thou breaker of bonds, thou wicked and immoral one!∫ Therefore Srikrishna does not live as yet in Brindavun. 38. Some say Krishna never lived, he is a myth. They mean on earth; for if Brindavun existed nowhere, the Bhagwat could not have been written. 39. Strange! the Germans have disproved the existence of Christ; yet his cruciÆxion remains still a greater historic fact than the death of Caesar. 40. Sometimes one is led to think that only those things really matter which have never happened; for beside them most historic achievements seem almost pale and ineffective. 41. There are four very great events in history, the siege of Troy, the life and cruciÆxion of Christ, the exile of Krishna in Brindavun and the colloquy with Arjuna on the Æeld of Kuru- kshetra. The siege of Troy created Hellas, the exile in Brindavun created devotional religion, (for before there was only medita- tion and worship,) Christ from his cross humanised Europe, the colloquy at Kurukshetra will yet liberate humanity.

They say that the Gospels are forgeries and Krishna a creation of the poets. Thank God then for the forgeries and bow down before the creators. 43. If God assigns to me my place in Hell, I do not know why I should aspire to Heaven. He knows best what is for my welfare. 44. If God draw me towards Heaven, then, even if His other hand strive to keep me in Hell, yet must I struggle upward. 45. Only those thoughts are true the opposite of which is also true in its own time and application; indisputable dogmas are the most dangerous kind of falsehoods. 46. Logic is the worst enemy of Truth, as self-righteousness is the worst enemy of virtue, – for the one cannot see its own errors nor the other its own imperfections. 47. When I was asleep in the Ignorance, I came to a place of meditation full of holy men and I found their company wearisome and the place a prison; when I awoke, God took me to a prison and turned it into a place of meditation and His trysting-ground. 48. When I read a wearisome book through and with pleasure, yet perceived all the perfection of its wearisomeness, then I knew that my mind was conquered. 49. I knew my mind to be conquered when it admired the beauty of the hideous, yet felt perfectly why other men shrank back or hated. 50. To feel & love the God of beauty and good in the ugly and the evil, and still yearn in utter love to heal it of its ugliness and its evil, this is real virtue and morality. 51. To hate the sinner is the worst sin, for it is hating God; yet he who commits it, glories in his superior virtue."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"Jnana 429 52. When I hear of a righteous wrath, I wonder at man's capacity for self-deception. 53. This is a miracle that men can love God, yet fail to love humanity. With whom are they in love then? 54. The quarrels of religious sects are like the disputing of pots, which shall be alone allowed to hold the immortalising nectar. Let them dispute, but the thing for us is to get at the nectar in whatever pot and attain immortality. 55. You say that the Øavour of the pot alters the liquor. That is taste; but what can deprive it of its immortalising faculty? 56. Be wide in me, O Varuna; be mighty in me, O Indra; O Sun, be very bright and luminous; O Moon, be full of charm and sweetness. Be Æerce and terrible, O Rudra; be impetuous and swift, O Maruts; be strong and bold, O Aryama; be voluptuous and pleasurable, O Bhaga; be tender and kind and loving and passionate, O Mitra. Be bright and revealing, O Dawn; O Night, be solemn and pregnant. O Life, be full, ready & buoyant; O Death, lead my steps from mansion to mansion. Harmonise all these, O Brahmanaspati. Let me not be subject to these gods, O Kali. 57. When, O eager disputant, thou hast prevailed in a debate, then art thou greatly to be pitied; for thou hast lost a chance of widening knowledge. 58. Because the tiger acts according to his nature and knows not anything else, therefore he is divine and there is no evil in him. If he questioned himself, then he would be a criminal. 59.

One of the greatest comforts of religion is that you can get hold of God sometimes and give him a satisfactory beating. People mock at the folly of savages who beat their gods when their prayers are not answered; but it is the mockers who are the fools and the savages. 61. There is no mortality. It is only the Immortal who can die; the mortal could neither be born nor perish. There is nothing Ænite. It is only the InÆnite who can make for Himself limits; the Ænite can have no beginning nor end, for the very act of conceiving its beginning & end declares its inÆnity. 62. I heard a fool discoursing utter folly and wondered what God meant by it; then I considered and saw a distorted mask of truth and wisdom. 63. God is great, says the Mahomedan. Yes, He is so great that He can afford to be weak, whenever that too is necessary. 64. God often fails in His workings; it is the sign of His illimitable godhead. 65. Because God is invincibly great, He can afford to be weak; because He is immutably pure, He can indulge with impunity in sin; He knows eternally all delight, therefore He tastes also the delight of pain; He is inalienably wise, therefore He has not debarred Himself from folly. 66. Sin is that which was once in its place, persisting now it is out of place; there is no other sinfulness. 67. There is no sin in man, but a great deal of disease, igno- rance and misapplication. 68. The sense of sin was necessary in order that man might become disgusted with his own imperfections. It was God's cor- rective for egoism. But man's egoism meets God's device by being"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Jnana 431 very dully alive to its own sins and very keenly alive to the sins of others. 69. Sin & virtue are a game of resistance we play with God in His efforts to draw us towards perfection. The sense of virtue helps us to cherish our sins in secret. 70. Examine thyself without pity, then thou wilt be more charitable and pitiful to others. 71. A thought is an arrow shot at the truth; it can hit a point, but not cover the whole target. But the archer is too well satisÆed with his success to ask anything farther. 72. The sign of dawning Knowledge is to feel that as yet I know little or nothing, & yet, if I could only know my knowledge, I already possess everything. 73. When Wisdom comes, her Ærst lesson is, ™There is no such thing as knowledge; there are only aper Àcus of the InÆnite Deity.∫ 74. Practical knowledge is a different thing; that is real and serviceable, but it is never complete. Therefore to systematise and codify it is necessary but fatal. 75. Systematise we must, but even in making & holding the system, we should always keep Ærm hold on this truth that all systems are in their nature transitory and incomplete. 76. Europe prides herself on her practical and scientiÆc or- ganisation and efÆciency. I am waiting till her organisation is perfect; then a child shall destroy her. 77.

When knowledge is fresh in us, then it is invincible; when it is old, it loses its virtue. This is because God moves always forward. 79. God is inÆnite Possibility. Therefore Truth is never at rest; therefore, also, Error is justiÆed of her children. 80. To listen to some devout people, one would imagine that God never laughs; Heine was nearer the mark when he found in Him the divine Aristophanes. 81. God's laughter is sometimes very coarse and unÆt for polite ears; He is not satisÆed with being Moli ¡ ere, He must needs also be Aristophanes and Rabelais. 82. If men took life less seriously, they could very soon make it more perfect. God never takes His works seriously; therefore one looks out on this wonderful Universe. 83. Shame has admirable results and both in aesthetics and in morality we could ill spare it; but for all that it is a badge of weakness and the proof of ignorance. 84. The supernatural is that the nature of which we have not attained or do not yet know, or the means of which we have not yet conquered. The common taste for miracles is the sign that man's ascent is not yet Ænished. 85. It is rationality and prudence to distrust the supernatural; but to believe in it, is also a sort of wisdom. 86. Great saints have performed miracles; greater saints have railed at them; the greatest have both railed at them and per- formed them. 87.

Thou canst not abolish cruelty, but thou mayst transÆgure it into its opposite, into a Æerce Love & Delightfulness. 90. This world was built by Ignorance & Error that they might know. Wilt thou abolish ignorance and error? Then knowledge too will perish. Thou canst not abolish ignorance & error, but thou mayst transmute them into the utter & effulgent exceeding of reason. 91.

Revelation is the direct sight, the direct hearing or the inspired memory of Truth, drishti, sruti, smriti; it is the highest experience and always accessible to renewed experience. Not because God spoke it, but because the soul saw it, is the word of the Scriptures our supreme authority. 99. The word of Scripture is infallible; it is in the interpretation the heart and reason put upon the Scripture that error has her portion. 100. Shun all lowness, narrowness & shallowness in religious thought & experience. Be wider than the widest horizons, be loftier than the highest Kanchenjunga, be profounder than the deepest oceans. 101. In God's sight there is no near or distant, no present, past or future. These things are only a convenient perspective for His world-picture. 102.

Vivekananda, exalting Sannyasa, has said that in all Indian history there is only one Janaka. Not so, for Janaka is not the name of a single individual, but a dynasty of self-ruling kings and the triumph-cry of an ideal. 104. In all the lakhs of ochre-clad Sannyasins, how many are perfect? It is the few attainments and the many approximations that justify an ideal. 105. There have been hundreds of perfect Sannyasins, because Sannyasa had been widely preached and numerously practised; let it be the same with the ideal freedom and we shall have hundreds of Janakas. 106. Sannyasa has a formal garb and outer tokens; therefore men think they can easily recognise it; but the freedom of a Janaka does not proclaim itself and it wears the garb of the world; to its presence even Narada was blinded. 107. Hard is it to be in the world, free, yet living the life of ordi- nary men; but because it is hard, therefore it must be attempted and accomplished. 108. When he watched the actions of Janaka, even Narada the divine sage thought him a luxurious worldling and libertine. Unless thou canst see the soul, how shalt thou say that a man is free or bound? 109. All things seem hard to man that are above his attained level, & they are hard to his unaided effort; but they become at once easy & simple when God in man takes up the contract. 110.

Knowledge is a child with its achievements; for when it has found out something, it runs about the streets whooping and shouting; Wisdom conceals hers for a long time in a thoughtful and mighty silence. 112.

Hatred is the sign of a secret attraction that is eager to Øee from itself and furious to deny its own existence. That too is God's play in His creature. 114. SelÆshness is the only sin, meanness the only vice, hatred the only criminality. All else can easily be turned into good, but these are obstinate resisters of deity. 115. The world is a long recurring decimal with Brahman for its integer. The period seems to begin and end, but the fraction is eternal; it will never have an end and never had any real beginning. 116. The beginning and end of things is a conventional term of our experience; in their true existence these terms have no reality, there is no end and no beginning. 117. ™Neither is it that I was not before nor thou nor these kings nor that all we shall not be hereafter.∫ Not only Brah- man, but beings & things in Brahman are eternal; their creation and destruction is a play of hide and seek with our outward consciousness. 118.

The love of inaction is folly and the scorn of inaction is folly; there is no inaction. The stone lying inert upon the sands which is kicked away in an idle moment, has been producing its effect upon the hemispheres. 122.

Every law, however embracing or tyrannous, meets some- where a contrary law by which its operation can be checked, modiÆed, annulled or eluded. 126.

Live according to Nature, runs the maxim of the West; but according to what nature, the nature of the body or the nature which exceeds the body? This Ærst we ought to determine. 129. O son of Immortality, live not thou according to Nature, but according to God; and compel her also to live according to the deity within thee. 130. Fate is God's foreknowledge outside Space & Time of all that in Space & Time shall yet happen; what He has foreseen, Power & Necessity work out by the conØict of forces. 131. Because God has willed and foreseen everything, thou shouldst not therefore sit inactive and wait upon His providence, for thy action is one of His chief effective forces. Up then and be doing, not with egoism, but as the circumstance, instrument and apparent cause of the event that He has predetermined. 132. When I knew nothing, then I abhorred the criminal, sinful and impure, being myself full of crime, sin and impurity; but when I was cleansed and my eyes unsealed, then I bowed down in my spirit before the thief and the murderer and adored the feet of the harlot; for I saw that these souls had accepted the terrible burden of evil and drained for all of us the greater portion of the churned poison of the world-ocean. 133. The Titans are stronger than the gods because they have agreed with God to front and bear the burden of His wrath and enmity; the gods were able to accept only the pleasant burden of His love and kindlier rapture. 134.

Why and how this should be so, is God's secret which only the soul puriÆed of egoism can penetrate. 136. Why is thy mind or thy body in pain? Because thy soul behind the veil wishes for the pain or takes delight in it; but if thou wilt – and perseverest in thy will – thou canst impose the spirit's law of unmixed delight on thy lower members. 137. There is no iron or ineffugable law that a given contact shall create pain or pleasure; it is the way the soul meets the rush or pressure of Brahman upon the members from outside them that determines either reaction. 138. The force of soul in thee meeting the same force from out- side cannot harmonise the measures of the contact in values of mind-experience & body-experience, therefore thou hast pain, grief or uneasiness. If thou canst learn to adjust the replies of the force in thyself to the questions of world-force, thou shalt Ænd pain becoming pleasurable or turning into pure delightfulness. Right relation is the condition of blissfulness, ritam the key of ananda. 139. Who is the superman? He who can rise above this matter- regarding broken mental human unit and possess himself uni- versalised and deiÆed in a divine force, a divine love & joy and a divine knowledge. 140. If thou keepest this limited human ego & thinkest thy- self the superman, thou art but the fool of thy own pride, the plaything of thy own force and the instrument of thy own illusions. 141. Nietzsche saw the superman as the lion-soul passing out of camel-hood, but the true heraldic device & token of the su- perman is the lion seated upon the camel which stands upon the cow of plenty.

Raven on all the joys of God as a lion over its prey, but bring also all humanity into that inÆnite Æeld of luxurious ecstasy to wallow there and to pasture. 143. If Art's service is but to imitate Nature, then burn all the picture galleries and let us have instead photographic studios. It is because Art reveals what Nature hides, that a small picture is worth more than all the jewels of the millionaires and the treasures of the princes. 144. If you only imitate visible Nature, you will perpetrate ei- ther a corpse, a dead sketch or a monstrosity; Truth lives in that which goes behind & beyond the visible & sensible. 145. O Poet, O Artist, if thou but holdest up the mirror to Nature, thinkest thou Nature will rejoice in thy work? Rather she will turn away her face. For what dost thou hold up to her there? Herself? No, but a lifeless outline & reØection, a shadowy mimicry. It is the secret soul of Nature thou hast to seize, thou hast to hunt eternally after the truth in the external symbol, and that no mirror will hold for thee, nor for her whom thou seekest. 146. I Ænd in Shakespeare a far greater & more consistent uni- versalist than the Greeks. All his creations are universal types from Lancelot Gobbo & his dog up to Lear & Hamlet. 147. The Greeks sought universality by omitting all Æner indi- vidual touches; Shakespeare sought it more successfully by uni- versalising the rarest individual details of character.

When our minds are involved in matter, they think matter the only reality; when we draw back into immaterial conscious- ness, then we see matter a mask and feel existence in conscious- ness alone as having the touch of reality. Which then of these two is the truth? Nay, God knoweth; but he who has had both experiences, can easily tell which condition is the more fertile in knowledge, the mightier & more blissful. 153. I believe immaterial consciousness to be truer than mate- rial consciousness? Because I know in the Ærst what in the second is hidden from me & also can command what the mind knows in matter. 154. Hell & Heaven exist only in the soul's consciousness. Ay, but so does the earth and its lands & seas & Æelds & deserts & mountains & rivers. All world is nothing but arrangement of the Soul's seeing. 155. There is only one soul & one existence; therefore we all see one objectivity only; but there are many knots of mind & ego in the one soul-existence, therefore we all see the one Object in different lights & shadows. 156. The idealist errs; it is not Mind which created the worlds, but that which created mind has created them. Mind only mis- sees, because it sees partially & by details, what is created. 157. Thus said Ramakrishna and thus said Vivekananda. Yes, but let me know also the truths which the Avatar cast not forth into speech and the prophet has omitted from his teachings. There will always be more in God than the thought of man has ever conceived or the tongue of man has ever uttered. 158. What was Ramakrishna?

Yet is the opposite truth also wholly true that if thou canst see all God in a little pale unsightly and scentless Øower, then hast thou hold of His supreme reality. 160. Shun the barren snare of an empty metaphysics and the dry dust of an unfertile intellectuality. Only that knowledge is worth having which can be made use of for a living delight and put out into temperament, action, creation and being. 161. Become & live the knowledge thou hast; then is thy knowl- edge the living God within thee. 162. Evolution is not Ænished; reason is not the last word nor the reasoning animal the supreme Ægure of Nature. As man emerged out of the animal, so out of man the superman emerges. 163. The power to observe law rigidly is the basis of freedom; therefore in most disciplines the soul has to endure & fulÆl the law in its lower members before it can rise to the perfect freedom of its divine being. Those disciplines which begin with freedom are only for the mighty ones who are naturally free or in former lives have founded their freedom. 164. Those who are deÆcient in the free, full and intelligent observation of a self-imposed law, must be placed in subjec- tion to the will of others. This is one principal cause of the subjection of nations. After their disturbing egoism has been trampled under the feet of a master, they are given or, if they have force in them, attain a fresh chance of deserving liberty by liberty. 165. To observe the law we have imposed on ourselves rather"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"444 Essays Divine and Human than the law of others is what is meant by liberty in our un- regenerate condition. Only in God & by the supremacy of the spirit can we enjoy a perfect freedom. 166. The double law of sin & virtue is imposed on us because we have not that ideal life & knowledge within which guides the soul spontaneously & infallibly to its self-fulÆlment. The law of sin & virtue ceases for us when the sun of God shines upon the soul in truth & love with its unveiled splendour. Moses is replaced by Christ, the Shastra by the Veda. 167. God within is leading us always aright even when we are in the bonds of the ignorance; but then, though the goal is sure, it is attained by circlings & deviations. 168. The Cross is in Yoga the symbol of the soul & nature in their strong & perfect union, but because of our fall into the impurities of ignorance it has become the symbol of suffering and puriÆcation. 169. Christ came into the world to purify, not to fulÆl. He himself foreknew the failure of his mission and the necessity of his return with the sword of God into a world that had rejected him. 170. Mahomed's mission was necessary, else we might have ended by thinking, in the exaggeration of our efforts at self- puriÆcation, that earth was meant only for the monk and the city created as a vestibule for the desert. 171. When all is said, Love & Force together can save the world eventually, but not Love only or Force only. Therefore Christ had to look forward to a second advent and Mahomed's religion, where it is not stagnant, looks forward through the Imams to a Mahdi. 172.

Law released into Freedom is the liberator. Not the Pandit, but the Yogin; not monasticism, but the inner renuncia- tion of desire and ignorance & egoism. 173. Even Vivekananda once in the stress of emotion admitted the fallacy that a personal God would be too immoral to be suffered and it would be the duty of all good men to resist Him. But if an omnipotent supra-moral Will & Intelligence governs the world, it is surely impossible to resist Him; our resistance would only serve His ends & really be dictated by Him. Is it not better then, instead of condemning or denying, to study and understand Him? 174. If we would understand God, we must renounce our egois- tic & ignorant human standards or else ennoble and universalise them. 175. Because a good man dies or fails & the evil live & triumph, is God therefore evil? I do not see the logic of the consequence. I must Ærst be convinced that death & failure are evil; I sometimes think that when they come, they are our supreme momentary good. But we are the fools of our hearts & nerves & argue that what they do not like or desire, must of course be an evil! 176. When I look back on my past life, I see that if I had not failed & suffered, I would have lost my life's supreme blessings; yet at the time of the suffering & failure, I was vexed with the sense of calamity. Because we cannot see anything but the one fact under our noses, therefore we indulge in all these snifØings and clamours. Be silent, ye foolish hearts! slay the ego, learn to see & feel vastly & universally. 177.

To be at large & to be in a large prison are not one condition of freedom. 179. Live for God in thy neighbour, God in thyself, God in thy country & the country of thy foeman, God in humanity, God in tree & stone & animal, God in the world & outside the world, then art thou on the straight path to liberation. 180. There are lesser & larger eternities, for eternity is a term of the soul & can exist in Time as well as exceeding it. When the Scriptures say ™ ¬ sa ¬ swatih samah∫, they mean for a long space & permanence of time or a hardly measurable aeon; only God Absolute has the absolute eternity. Yet when one goes within, one sees that all things are secretly eternal; there is no end, neither was there ever a beginning. 181. When thou callest another a fool, as thou must, sometimes, yet do not forget that thou thyself hast been the supreme fool in humanity. 182. God loves to play the fool in season; man does it in season & out of season. It is the only difference. 183. In the Buddhists' view to have saved an ant from drowning is a greater work than to have founded an empire. There is a truth in the idea, but a truth that can easily be exaggerated. 184. To exalt one virtue, – compassion even, – unduly above all others is to cover up with one's hand the eyes of wisdom. God moves always towards a harmony. 185. Pity may be reserved, so long as thy soul makes distinc- tions, for the suffering animals; but humanity deserves from thee something nobler; it asks for love, for understanding, for comradeship, for the help of the equal & brother."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Jnana 447 186. The contributions of evil to the good of the world & the harm sometimes done by the virtuous are distressing to the soul enamoured of good. Nevertheless be not distressed nor confounded, but study rather & calmly understand God's ways with humanity. 187. In God's providence there is no evil, but only good or its preparation. 188. Virtue & vice were made for thy soul's struggle & progress; but for results they belong to God, who fulÆls himself beyond vice & virtue. 189. Live within; be not shaken by outward happenings. 190. Fling not thy alms abroad everywhere in an ostentation of charity; understand & love where thou helpest. Let thy soul grow within thee. 191. Help the poor while the poor are with thee; but study also & strive that there may be no poor for thy assistance. 192. The old Indian social ideal demanded of the priest vol- untary simplicity of life, purity, learning and the gratuitous instruction of the community, of the prince, war, government, protection of the weak & the giving up of his life in the bat- tleÆeld, of the merchant, trade, gain and the return of his gains to the community by free giving, of the serf, labour for the rest & material havings. In atonement for his serfhood, it spared him the tax of self-denial, the tax of blood & the tax of his riches. 193. The existence of poverty is the proof of an unjust & ill- organised society, and our public charities are but the Ærst tardy awakening in the conscience of a robber. 194. Valmekie, our ancient epic poet, includes among the signs"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"448 Essays Divine and Human of a just & enlightened state of society not only universal ed- ucation, morality and spirituality but this also that there shall be ™none who is compelled to eat coarse food, none uncrowned & unanointed or who is restricted to a mean and petty share of luxuries.∫ 195. The acceptance of poverty is noble & beneÆcial in a class or an individual, but it becomes fatal and pauperises life of its richness & expansion if it is perverted into a general or national ideal. Athens, not Sparta, is the progressive type for mankind. Ancient India with its ideal of vast riches & vast spending was the greatest of nations; modern India with its trend towards national asceticism has Ænally become poor in life & sunk into weakness & degradation. 196. Poverty is no more a necessity of organised social life than disease of the natural body; false habits of life & an ignorance of our true organisation are in both cases the peccant causes of an avoidable disorder. 197. Do not dream that when thou hast got rid of material poverty, men will even so be happy or satisÆed or society freed from ills, troubles & problems. This is only the Ærst & lowest necessity. While the soul within remains defectively organised, there will always be outward unrest, disorder & revolution. 198. Disease will always return to the body if the soul is Øawed; for the sins of the mind are the secret cause of the sins of the body. So too poverty & trouble will always return on man in society, so long as the mind of the race is subjected to egoism. 199. Religion & philosophy seek to rescue man from his ego; then the kingdom of heaven within will be spontaneously re- Øected in an external divine city. 200. Mediaeval Christianity said to the race, ™Man, thou art in thy earthly life an evil thing & a worm before God; renounce"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Jnana 449 then egoism, live for a future state and submit thyself to God & His priest.∫ The results were not over-good for humanity.

Vedanta says rather, ™Man, thou art of one nature & substance with God, one soul with thy fellow-men. Awake & progress then to thy utter divinity, live for God in thyself & in others.∫ This gospel which was given only to the few, must now be offered to all mankind for its deliverance. 202. The human race always progresses most when most it asserts its importance to Nature, its freedom & its universality. 203. Animal man is the obscure starting-point, the present nat- ural man the varied & tangled mid-road but supernatural man the luminous & transcendent goal of our human journey. 204. Life and action culminate and are eternally crowned for thee when thou hast attained the power of symbolising & man- ifesting in every thought & act, in wealth getting, wealth having or wealth spending, in home & government & society, in art, literature and life, the One Immortal in this lower mortal being."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"Karma"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Karma 205. God leads man while man is misleading himself, the higher nature watches over the stumblings of his lower mortality; this is the tangle & contradiction out of which we have to escape into the [?self-unity] to which alone is possible a clear knowledge & a faultless action. 206. That thou shouldst have pity on creatures, is well, but not well, if thou art a slave to thy pity. Be a slave to nothing except to God, not even to His most luminous angels. 207. Beatitude is God's aim for humanity; get this supreme good for thyself Ærst that thou mayst distribute it entirely to thy fellow-beings. 208. He who acquires for himself alone, acquires ill though he may call it heaven and virtue. 209. In my ignorance I thought anger could be noble and vengeance grandiose; but now when I watch Achilles in his epic fury, I see a very Æne baby in a very Æne rage and I am pleased and amused. 210. Power is noble, when it overtops anger; destruction is grandiose, but it loses caste when it proceeds from vengeance. Leave these things, for they belong to a lower humanity. 211. Poets make much of death and external afØictions; but the only tragedies are the soul's failures and the only epic man's triumphant ascent towards godhead. 212.

For genius itself is an abnormal birth and out of man's ordinary centre. 214. Genius is Nature's Ærst attempt to liberate the imprisoned god out of her human mould; the mould has to suffer in the pro- cess. It is astonishing that the cracks are so few and unimportant. 215. Nature sometimes gets into a fury with her own resistance, then she damages the brain in order to free the inspiration; for in this effort the equilibrium of the average material brain is her chief opponent. Pass over the madness of such and proÆt by their inspiration. 216. Who can bear Kali rushing into the system in her Æerce force and burning godhead? Only the man whom Krishna al- ready possesses. 217. Hate not the oppressor, for, if he is strong, thy hate increases his force of resistance; if he is weak, thy hate was needless. 218. Hatred is a sword of power, but its edge is always double. It is like the Kritya of the ancient magicians which, if baulked of its prey, returned in fury to devour its sender. 219. Love God in thy opponent, even while thou strikest him; so shall neither have hell for his portion. 220. Men talk of enemies, but where are they?

SacriÆce, sacriÆce, sacriÆce always, but for the sake of God and humanity, not for the sake of sacriÆce. 225. SelÆshness kills the soul; destroy it. But take care that your altruism does not kill the souls of others. 226. Very usually, altruism is only the sublimest form of self- ishness. 227. He who will not slay when God bids him, works in the world an incalculable havoc. 228. Respect human life as long as you can; but respect more the life of humanity. 229. Men slay out of uncontrollable anger, hatred or vengeance; they shall suffer the rebound now or hereafter; or they slay to serve a selÆsh end, coldly; God shall not pardon them. If thou slay, Ærst let thy soul have known death for a reality & seen God in the smitten, the stroke & the striker. 230. Courage and love are the only indispensable virtues; even if all the others are eclipsed or fall asleep, these two will save the soul alive. 231.

Nobleness and generosity are the soul's ethereal Ærma- ment; without them, one looks at an insect in a dungeon. 233. Let not thy virtues be such as men praise or reward, but such as make for thy perfection and God in thy nature demands of thee. 234. Altruism, duty, family, country, humanity are the prisons of the soul when they are not its instruments. 235. Our country is God the Mother; speak not evil of her unless thou canst do it with love and tenderness. 236. Men are false to their country for their own proÆt; yet they go on thinking they have a right to turn in horror from the matricide. 237. Break the moulds of the past, but keep safe its gains and its spirit, or else thou hast no future. 238. Revolutions hew the past to pieces and cast it into a cauldron, but what has emerged is the old Aeson with a new visage. 239. The world has had only half a dozen successful revolutions and most even of these were very like failures; yet it is by great & noble failures that humanity advances. 240. Atheism is a necessary protest against the wickedness of the Churches and the narrowness of creeds. God uses it as a stone to smash these soiled card-houses. 241.

If God did not take upon Himself the burden of tempting men, the world would very soon go to perdition. 244. Suffer yourself to be tempted within so that you may exhaust in the struggle your downward propensities. 245. If you leave it to God to purify, He will exhaust the evil in you subjectively; but if you insist on guiding yourself, you will fall into much outward sin and suffering. 246. Call not everything evil which men call evil, but only that reject which God has rejected; call not everything good which men call good, but accept only what God has accepted. 247. Men in the world have two lights, duty and principle; but he who has passed over to God, has done with both and replaced them by God's will. If men abuse thee for this, care not, O divine instrument, but go on thy way like the wind or the sun fostering and destroying. 248. Not to cull the praises of men has God made thee His own, but to do fearlessly His bidding. 249. Accept the world as God's theatre; be thou the mask of the Actor and let Him act through thee. If men praise or hiss thee, know that they too are masks & take God within for thy only critic and audience. 250. If Krishna be alone on one side and the armed & organised world with its hosts and its shrapnel and its Maxims on the other, yet prefer thy divine solitude. Care not if the world passes over thy body and its shrapnel tear thee to pieces and its cavalry trample thy limbs into shapeless mire by the wayside; for the mind was always a simulacrum and the body a carcass.

But defeat is not the end, it is only a gate or a beginning. 252. I have failed, thou sayest. Say rather that God is circling about towards His object. 253. Foiled by the world, thou turnest to seize upon God. If the world is stronger than thou, thinkest thou God is weaker? Turn to Him rather for His bidding and for strength to fulÆl it. 254. So long as a cause has on its side one soul that is intangible in faith, it cannot perish. 255. Reason gives me no basis for this faith, thou murmurest. Fool! if it did, faith would not be needed or demanded of thee. 256. Faith in the heart is the obscure & often distorted reØection of a hidden knowledge. The believer is often more plagued by doubt than the most inveterate sceptic. He persists because there is something subconscient in him which knows. That tolerates both his blind faith & twilit doubts and drives towards the revelation of that which it knows. 257. The world thinks that it moves by the light of reason but it is really impelled by its faiths and instincts. 258. Reason adapts itself to the faith or argues out a justiÆca- tion of the instincts, but it receives the impulse subconsciously; therefore men think that they act rationally. 259. The only business of reason is to arrange and criticise the perceptions. It has neither in itself any means of positive conclusion nor any command to action. When it pretends to originate or impel, it is masking other agencies. 260. Until Wisdom comes to thee, use the reason for its God- given purposes and faith and instinct for theirs.

Perceive always and act in the light of thy increasing per- ceptions, but not those of the reasoning brain only. God speaks to the heart when the brain cannot understand him. 262. If thy heart tell thee, Thus & by such means and at such a time it will happen, believe it not. But if it gives thee the purity and wideness of God's command, hearken to it. 263. When thou hast the command, care only to fulÆl it. The rest is God's will and arrangement which men call chance and luck and fortune. 264. If thy aim be great and thy means small, still act; for by action alone these can increase to thee. 265. Care not for time and success. Act out thy part, whether it be to fail or to prosper. 266. There are three forms in which the command may come, the will and faith in thy nature, thy ideal on which heart and brain are agreed and the voice of Himself or His angels. 267. There are times when action is unwise or impossible; then go into tapasya in some physical solitude or in the retreats of thy soul and await whatever divine word or manifestation. 268. Leap not too quickly at all voices, for there are lying spirits ready to deceive thee; but let thy heart be pure and afterwards listen. 269. There are times when God seems to be sternly on the side of the past; then what has been and is, sits Ærm as on a throne and clothes itself with an irrevocable ™I shall be∫.

He who would win high spiritual degrees, must pass end- less tests and examinations. But most are anxious only to bribe the examiner. 272. Fight, while thy hands are free, with thy hands and thy voice and thy brain and all manner of weapons. Art thou chained in the enemy's dungeons and have his gags silenced thee? Fight with thy silent all-besieging soul and thy wide- ranging will-power and when thou art dead, Æght still with the world-encompassing force that went out from God within thee. 273. Thou thinkest the ascetic in his cave or on his mountaintop a stone and a do-nothing? What dost thou know? He may be Ælling the world with the mighty currents of his will & changing it by the pressure of his soul-state. 274. That which the liberated sees in his soul on its mountain- tops, heroes and prophets spring up in the material world to proclaim and accomplish. 275. The Theosophists are wrong in their circumstances but right in the essential. If the French Revolution took place, it was because a soul on the Indian snows dreamed of God as freedom, brotherhood and equality. 276. All speech and action comes prepared out of the eternal Silence. 277. There is no disturbance in the depths of the Ocean, but above there is the joyous thunder of its shouting and its racing shoreward; so is it with the liberated soul in the midst of violent action. The soul does not act; it only breathes out from itself overwhelming action. 278. O soldier and hero of God, where for thee is sorrow or shame or suffering?

I saw a coward hold out his cheek to the smiter; I saw a physical weakling struck by a strong and self-approving bully look quietly & intently at the aggressor; I saw God incarnate smile lovingly on those who stoned him. The Ærst was ridiculous, the second terrible, the third divine and holy. 290. It is noble to pardon thine own injurers, but not so noble to pardon wrongs done to others. Nevertheless pardon these too, but when needful, calmly avenge. 291. When Asiatics massacre, it is an atrocity; when Europeans, it is a military exigency. Appreciate the distinction and ponder over this world's virtues. 292. Watch the too indignantly righteous.

There are two ways of avoiding the snare of woman; one is to shun all women and the other to love all beings. 305. Asceticism is no doubt very healing, a cave very peaceful and the hill-tops wonderfully pleasant; nevertheless do thou act in the world as God intended thee. 306.

There are two who are unÆt for greatness and freedom, the man who has never been a slave to another and the nation that has never been under the yoke of foreigners. 310.

Plan not with the intellect, but let thy divine sight arrange thy plans for thee.

Men see events as unaccomplished, to be striven for and effected. This is false seeing; events are not effected, they de- velop. The event is Brahman, already accomplished from of old, it is now manifesting. 318.

When it appears to us again in its truth & beauty, then in that light they will vanish. 320. The anarchic is the true divine state of man in the end as in the beginning; but in between it would lead us straight to the devil and his kingdom. 321. The communistic principle of society is intrinsically as superior to the individualistic as is brotherhood to jealousy and mutual slaughter; but all the practical schemes of Socialism invented in Europe are a yoke, a tyranny and a prison. 322.

India had three fortresses of a communal life, the village community, the larger joint family & the orders of the San- nyasins; all these are broken or breaking with the stride of egoistic conceptions of social life; but is not this after all only the breaking of these imperfect moulds on the way to a larger & diviner communism? 327. The individual cannot be perfect until he has surrendered all he now calls himself to the divine Being. So also, until mankind gives all it has to God, never shall there be a perfected society. 328. There is nothing small in God's eyes; let there be nothing small in thine. He bestows as much labour of divine energy on the formation of a shell as on the building of an empire.

But wherever communities of men not bound by family ties are united in one sentiment and aspiration to defend a common inheritance from their ancestors or assure a common future for their posterity, there a nation is already in existence. 333. Nationality is a stride of the progressive God passing be- yond the stage of the family; therefore the attachment to clan and tribe must weaken or perish before a nation can be born. 334. Family, nationality, humanity are Vishnu's three strides from an isolated to a collective unity. The Ærst has been fulÆlled, we yet strive for the perfection of the second, towards the third we are reaching out our hands and the pioneer work is already attempted. 335. With the present morality of the human race a sound and durable human unity is not yet possible; but there is no reason why a temporary approximation to it should not be the reward of strenuous aspiration and untiring effort.

Democracy was the protest of the human soul against the allied despotisms of autocrat, priest and noble; Socialism is the protest of the human soul against the despotism of a plutocratic democracy; Anarchism is likely to be the protest of the human soul against the tyranny of a bureaucratic Socialism. A turbulent and eager march from illusion to illusion and from failure to failure is the image of European progress. 341. Democracy in Europe is the rule of the Cabinet minister, the corrupt deputy or the self-seeking capitalist masqued by the occasional sovereignty of a wavering populace; Socialism in Europe is likely to be the rule of the ofÆcial and policeman masqued by the theoretic sovereignty of an abstract State. It is chimerical to enquire which is the better system; it would be difÆcult to decide which is the worse. 342. The gain of democracy is the security of the individual's life, liberty and goods from the caprices of the tyrant one or the selÆsh few; its evil is the decline of greatness in humanity. 343. This erring race of human beings dreams always of per- fecting their environment by the machinery of government and society; but it is only by the perfection of the soul within that the outer environment can be perfected. What thou art within, that outside thee thou shalt enjoy; no machinery can rescue thee from the law of thy being."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Karma 469 344. Be always vigilant against thy human proneness to per- secute or ignore the reality even while thou art worshipping its semblance or token. Not human wickedness but human fallibility is the opportunity of Evil. 345. Honour the garb of the ascetic, but look also at the wearer, lest hypocrisy occupy the holy places and inward saintliness become a legend. 346. The many strive after competence or riches, the few em- brace poverty as a bride; but, for thyself, strive after and embrace God only. Let Him choose for thee a king's palace or the bowl of the beggar. 347. What is vice but an enslaving habit and virtue but a human opinion? See God and do His will; walk in whatever path He shall trace for thy goings. 348. In the world's conØicts espouse not the party of the rich for their riches, nor of the poor for their poverty, of the king for his power & majesty, nor of the people for their hope and fervour, but be on God's side always. Unless indeed He has commanded thee to war against Him! then do that with thy whole heart and strength and rapture. 349. How shall I know God's will with me? I have to put egoism out of me, hunting it from every lair & burrow, and bathe my puriÆed and naked soul in His inÆnite workings; then He himself will reveal it to me. 350. Only the soul that is naked and unashamed, can be pure and innocent, even as Adam was in the primal garden of hu- manity. 351.

Altruism is good for man, but less good when it is a form of supreme self-indulgence & lives by pampering the selÆshness of others. 353. By altruism thou canst save thy soul, but see that thou save it not by indulging in his perdition thy brother. 354. Self-denial is a mighty instrument for puriÆcation; it is not an end in itself nor a Ænal law of living. Not to mortify thyself but to satisfy God in the world must be thy object. 355. It is easy to distinguish the evil worked by sin & vice, but the trained eye sees also the evil done by self-righteous or self-regarding virtue. 356. The Brahmin Ærst ruled by the book & the ritual, the Kshatriya next by the sword and the buckler; now the Vaishya governs us by machinery & the dollar, & the Sudra, the liberated serf, presses in with his doctrine of the kingdom of associated labour. But neither priest, king, merchant nor labourer is the true governor of humanity; the despotism of the tool and the mattock will fail like all the preceding despotisms. Only when egoism dies & God in man governs his own human universality, can this earth support a happy and contented race of beings. 357. Men run after pleasure and clasp feverishly that burning bride to their tormented bosoms; meanwhile a divine & faultless bliss stands behind them waiting to be seen and claimed and captured. 358. Men hunt after petty successes & trivial masteries from which they fall back into exhaustion & weakness; meanwhile all the inÆnite force of God in the universe waits vainly to place itself at their disposal. 359.

O soul of India, hide thyself no longer with the dark- ened Pandits of the Kaliyuga in the kitchen & the chapel, veil not thyself with the soulless rite, the obsolete law and the unblessed money of the dakshina; but seek in thy soul, ask of God and recover thy true Brahminhood & Kshatriya- hood with the eternal Veda; restore the hidden truth of the Vedic sacriÆce, return to the fulÆlment of an older & mightier Vedanta. 362. Limit not sacriÆce to the giving up of earthly goods or the denial of some desires & yearnings, but let every thought and every work & every enjoyment be an offering to God within thee. Let thy steps walk in thy Lord, let thy sleep and waking be a sacriÆce to Krishna. 363. This is not according to my Shastra or my Science, say the men of rule, formalists.

Act according to the Shastra rather than thy self-will & desire; so shalt thou grow stronger to control the ravener in thee; but act according to God rather than the Shastra; so shalt thou reach to His highest which is far above rule & limit. 367. The Law is for the bound & those whose eyes are sealed; if they walk not by it, they will stumble; but thou who art free in Krishna or hast seen his living light, walk holding the hand of thy Friend & by the lamp of eternal Veda. 368. The Vedanta is God's lamp to lead thee out of this night of bondage & egoism; but when the light of Veda has dawned in thy soul, then even that divine lamp thou needest not, for now thou canst walk freely & surely in a high & eternal sunlight. 369. What is the use of only knowing? I say to thee, Act and be, for therefore God sent thee into this human body. 370. What is the use of only being? I say to thee, Become, for therefore wast thou established as a man in this world of matter. 371. The path of works is in a way the most difÆcult side of God's triune causeway; yet is it not also, in this material world at least, the easiest, widest & most delightful? For at every moment we clash against God the worker & grow into His being by a thousand divine touches. 372. This is the wonder of the way of works that even enmity to God can be made an agency of salvation.

What is this thing thou callest death? Can God die? O thou who fearest death, it is Life that has come to thee sporting with a death-head and wearing a mask of terror. 375. There is a means to attain physical immortality and death is by our choice, not by Nature's compulsion. But who would care to wear one coat for a hundred years or be conÆned in one narrow & changeless lodging unto a long eternity? 376. Fear and anxiety are perverse forms of will. What thou fearest & ponderest over, striking that note repeatedly in thy mind, thou helpest to bring about; for, if thy will above the surface of waking repels it, it is yet what thy mind underneath is all along willing, & the subconscious mind is mightier, wider, better equipped to fulÆl than thy waking force & intellect. But the spirit is stronger than both together; from fear and hope take refuge in the grandiose calm and careless mastery of the spirit. 377. God made the inÆnite world by Self-knowledge which in its works is Will-Force self-fulÆlling. He used ignorance to limit His inÆnity; but fear, weariness, depression, self-distrust and assent to weakness are the instruments by which He destroys what He created. When these things are turned on what is evil or harmful & ill-regulated within thee, then it is well; but if they attack thy very sources of life & strength, then seize & expel them or thou diest. 378.

We swing for ever between two false opposites. 380. It is well not to be too loosely playful in one's games or too grimly serious in one's life and works. We seek in both a playful freedom and a serious order. 381. For nearly forty years I believed them when they said I was weakly in constitution, suffered constantly from the smaller & the greater ailments & mistook this curse for a burden that Na- ture had laid upon me. When I renounced the aid of medicines, then they began to depart from me like disappointed parasites. Then only I understood what a mighty force was the natural health within me & how much mightier yet the Will & Faith exceeding mind which God meant to be the divine support of our life in this body. 382. Machinery is necessary to modern humanity because of our incurable barbarism. If we must incase ourselves in a bewil- dering multitude of comforts and trappings, we must needs do without Art and its methods; for to dispense with simplicity & freedom is to dispense with beauty. The luxury of our ancestors was rich & even gorgeous, but never encumbered. 383. I cannot give to the barbarous comfort & encumbered os- tentation of European life the name of civilisation. Men who are not free in their souls & nobly rhythmical in their appointments, are not civilised. 384. Art in modern times & under European inØuence has become an excrescence upon life or an unnecessary menial; it should have been its chief steward and indispensable arranger. 385. Disease is needlessly prolonged & ends in death oftener than is inevitable, because the mind of the patient supports & dwells upon the disease of his body."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Karma 475 386. Medical Science has been more a curse to mankind than a blessing. It has broken the force of epidemics and unveiled a marvellous surgery; but, also, it has weakened the natural health of man and multiplied individual diseases; it has implanted fear and dependence in the mind and body; it has taught our health to repose not on natural soundness but a rickety & distasteful crutch compact from the mineral and vegetable kingdoms. 387. The doctor aims a drug at a disease; sometimes it hits, sometimes misses. The misses are left out of account, the hits treasured up, reckoned and systematised into a science. 388. We laugh at the savage for his faith in the medicine man; but how are the civilised less superstitious who have faith in the doctors? The savage Ænds that when a certain incantation is repeated, he often recovers from a certain disease; he believes. The civilised patient Ænds that when he doses himself according to a certain prescription, he often recovers from a certain disease; he believes. Where is the difference? 389. The north-country Indian herdsman, attacked by fever, sits in the chill stream of a river for an hour or more & rises up free & healthy. If the educated man did the same, he would perish, not because the same remedy in its nature kills one & cures another, but because our bodies have been fatally indoctrinated by the mind into false habits. 390. It is not the medicine that cures so much as the patient's faith in the doctor and the medicine. Both are a clumsy substitute for the natural faith in one's own self-power which they have themselves destroyed. 391.

We ought to use the divine health in us to cure and prevent diseases; but Galen and Hippocrates & their tribe have given us instead an armoury of drugs and a barbarous Latin hocuspocus as our physical gospel. 394. Medical Science is well-meaning and its practitioners often benevolent and not seldom self-sacriÆcing; but when did the well-meaning of the ignorant save them from harm-doing? 395. If all remedies were really and in themselves efÆcacious and all medical theories sound, how would that console us for our lost natural health and vitality? The upas-tree is sound in all its parts, but it is still an upas-tree. 396. The spirit within us is the only all-efÆcient doctor and submission of the body to it the one true panacea. 397. God within is inÆnite and self-fulÆlling Will. Unappalled by the fear of death, canst thou leave to Him, not as an experi- ment, with a calm & entire faith thy ailments? Thou shalt Ænd in the end that He exceeds the skill of a million doctors. 398. Health protected by twenty thousand precautions is the gospel of the doctor; but it is not God's evangel for the body, nor Nature's. 399. Man was once naturally healthy and could revert to that primal condition if he were suffered; but Medical Science pur- sues our body with an innumerable pack of drugs and assails the imagination with ravening hordes of microbes. 400.

It should take long for self-cure to replace medicine, be- cause of the fear, self-distrust and unnatural physical reliance on drugs which Medical Science has taught to our minds & bodies & made our second nature. 403. Medicine is necessary for our bodies in disease only be- cause our bodies have learned the art of not getting well without medicines. Even so, one sees often that the moment Nature chooses for recovery is that in which the life is abandoned as hopeless by the doctors. 404. Distrust of the curative power within us was our physical fall from Paradise. Medical Science and a bad heredity are the two angels of God who stand at the gates to forbid our return and reentry. 405.

Thy soul has not tasted God's entire delight, if it has never had the joy of being His enemy, opposing His designs and engaging with Him in mortal combat. 418. If you cannot make God love you, make Him Æght you. If He will not give you the embrace of the lover, compel Him to give you the embrace of the wrestler. 419. My soul is the captive of God, taken by Him in battle; it still remembers the war, though so far from it, with delight and alarm and wonder. 420. Most of all things on earth I hated pain till God hurt and tortured me; then it was revealed to me that pain is only a perverse and recalcitrant shape of excessive delight. 421. There are four stages in the pain God gives to us; when it is only pain; when it is pain that causes pleasure; when it is pain that is pleasure; and when it is purely a Æercer form of delight. 422. Even when one has climbed up into those levels of bliss where pain vanishes, it still survives disguised as intolerable ecstasy. 423.

The next greatest rapture to the love of God, is the love of God in men; there, too, one has the joy of multiplicity. 425. For monogamy may be the best for the body, but the soul that loves God in men dwells here always as the boundless & ecstatic polygamist; yet all the time – that is the secret – it is in love with only one being. 426. The whole world is my seraglio and every living being and inanimate existence in it is the instrument of my rapture. 427. I did not know for some time whether I loved Krishna best or Kali; when I loved Kali, it was loving myself, but when I loved Krishna, I loved another, and still it was my Self with whom I was in love. Therefore I came to love Krishna better even than Kali. 428. What is the use of admiring Nature or worshipping her as a Power, a Presence and a goddess? What is the use, either, of appreciating her aesthetically or artistically? The secret is to enjoy her with the soul as one enjoys a woman with the body. 429. When one has the vision in the heart, everything, Nature and Thought and Action, ideas and occupations and tastes and objects become the Beloved and are a source of ecstasy. 430. The philosophers who reject the world as Maya, are very wise and austere and holy; but I cannot help thinking sometimes that they are also just a little stupid and allow God to cheat them too easily. 431. For my part, I think I have a right to insist on God giving Himself to me in the world as well as out of it. Why did He make it at all, if He wanted to escape that obligation? 432.

Beyond Personality the Mayavadin sees indeÆnable Exis- tence; I followed him there and found my Krishna beyond in indeÆnable Personality. 434. When I Ærst met Krishna, I loved Him as a friend and playmate till He deceived me; then I was indignant and could not forgive Him. Afterwards I loved Him as a lover and He still deceived me; I was again and much more indignant, but this time I had to pardon. 435. After offending, He forced me to pardon Him not by reparation, but by committing fresh offences. 436. So long as God tried to repair His offences against me, we went on periodically quarrelling; but when He found out His mistake, the quarrelling stopped, for I had to submit to Him entirely. 437. When I saw others than Krishna and myself in the world, I kept secret God's doings with me; but since I began to see Him and myself everywhere, I have become shameless and garrulous. 438. All that my Lover has, belongs to me. Why do you abuse me for showing off the ornaments He has given to me? 439. My Lover took His crown and royal necklace from His head and neck and clothed me with them; but the disciples of the saints and the prophets abused me and said, ™He is hunting after siddhis.∫ 440.

Why should I care that the worldlings mock and the Pharisees turn their faces? 443. To thy lover, O Lord, the railing of the world is wild honey and the pelting of stones by the mob is summer rain on the body. For is it not Thou that railest and peltest, and is it not Thou in the stones that strikest and hurtest me? 444. There are two things in God which men call evil, that which they cannot understand at all and that which they mis- understand and, possessing, misuse; it is only what they grope after half-vainly and dimly understand that they call good and holy. But to me all things in Him are lovable. 445. They say, O my God, that I am mad because I see no fault in Thee; but if I am indeed mad with Thy love, I do not wish to recover my sanity. 446. ™Errors, falsehoods, stumblings!∫ they cry. How bright and beautiful are Thy errors, O Lord! Thy falsehoods save Truth alive; by Thy stumblings the world is perfected. 447.

To love God, excluding the world, is to give Him an intense but imperfect adoration. 451. Is love only a daughter or handmaid of jealousy? If Krishna loves Chandrabali, why should I not love her also? 452. Because thou lovest God only, thou art apt to claim that He should love thee rather than others; but this is a false claim contrary to right & the nature of things. For He is the One but thou art of the many. Rather become one in heart & soul with all beings, then there will be none in the world but thou alone for Him to love. 453. My quarrel is with those who are foolish enough not to love my Lover, not with those who share His love with me. 454. In those whom God loves, have delight; on those whom He pretends not to love, take pity. 455. Dost thou hate the atheist because he does love not God? Then shouldst thou be disliked because thou dost not love God perfectly. 456. There is one thing especially in which creeds and churches surrender themselves to the devil, and that is in their anathemas. When the priest chants Anathema Maranatha, then I see a devil worshipper praying. 457. No doubt, when the priest curses, he is crying to God; but it is the God of anger and darkness to whom he devotes himself along with his enemy; for as he approaches God, so shall God receive him. 458.

I hated the devil and was sick with his temptations and tortures; and I could not tell why the voice in his departing words was so sweet that when he returned often and offered himself to me, it was with sorrow I refused him. Then I discovered it was Krishna at His tricks and my hate was changed into laughter. 460. They explained the evil in the world by saying that Satan had prevailed against God; but I think more proudly of my Beloved. I believe that nothing is done but by His will in heaven or hell, on earth or on the waters. 461. In our ignorance we are like children proud of our success in walking erect and unaided and too eager to be aware of the mother's steadying touch on the shoulder. When we wake, we look back and see that God was leading and upholding us always. 462. At Ærst whenever I fell back into sin, I used to weep and rage against myself and against God for having suffered it. Af- terwards it was as much as I could dare to ask, ™Why hast thou rolled me again in the mud, O my playfellow?∫ Then even that came to my mind to seem too bold and presumptuous; I could only get up in silence, look at him out of the corner of my eyes – and clean myself. 463. God has so arranged life that the world is the soul's hus- band; Krishna its divine paramour. We owe a debt of service to the world and are bound to it by a law, a compelling opinion, and a common experience of pain and pleasure, but our heart's worship and our free and secret joy are for our Lover. 464.

God, the world Guru, is wiser than thy mind; trust Him and not that eternal self-seeker & arrogant sceptic. 466. The sceptic mind doubts always because it cannot un- derstand, but the faith of the God-lover persists in knowing although it cannot understand. Both are necessary to our dark- ness, but there can be no doubt which is the mightier. What I cannot understand now, I shall some day master, but if I lose faith & love, I fall utterly from the goal which God has set before me. 467. I may question God, my guide & teacher, & ask Him, ™Am I right or hast Thou in thy love & wisdom suffered my mind to deceive me?∫ Doubt thy mind, if thou wilt, but doubt not that God leads thee. 468. Because thou wert given at Ærst imperfect conceptions about God, now thou ragest and deniest Him. Man, dost thou doubt thy teacher because he gave not thee the whole of knowl- edge at the beginning?

This is how God in His love teaches the child soul & the weakling, taking them step by step and withholding the vision of His ultimate & yet unattainable mountaintops. And have we not all some weakness? Are we not all in His sight but as little children? 470. This I have seen that whatever God has withheld from me, He withheld in His love & wisdom.

Even the atheist ought now to be able to see that cre- ation marches towards some inÆnite & mighty purpose which evolution in its very nature supposes.

Revere then that Wisdom & worship it with thoughts in thy soul if not with incense in a temple, and even though thou deny it the heart of inÆnite Love and the mind of inÆnite self-effulgence. Then though thou know it not it is still Krishna whom thou reverest & worshippest. 472. The Lord of Love has said, ™They who follow after the Unknowable & IndeÆnable, follow after Me and I accept them.∫ He has justiÆed by His word the Illusionist & the Agnostic. Why then, O devotee, dost thou rail at him whom thy Master has accepted? 473. Calvin who justiÆed eternal Hell, knew not God but made one terrible mask of Him His eternal reality. If there were an unending Hell, it could only be a seat of unending rapture; for God is Ananda and than the eternity of His bliss there is no other eternity. 474. Dante, when he said that God's perfect love created eter- nal Hell, wrote perhaps wiselier than he knew; for from stray glimpses I have sometimes thought there is a Hell where our souls suffer aeons of intolerable ecstasy & wallow as if for ever in the utter embrace of Rudra, the sweet & terrible. 475. Discipleship to God the Teacher, sonship to God the Fa- ther, tenderness of God the Mother, clasp of the hand of the divine Friend, laughter and sport with our Comrade and boy Playfellow, blissful servitude to God the Master, rapturous love of our divine Paramour, these are the seven beatitudes of life in the human body.

When all mankind becomes boys & girls together with God revealed as Krishna & Kali, the happiest boy & strongest girl of the crowd, playing together in the gardens of Paradise. The Semitic Eden was well enough, but Adam & Eve were too grown up and its God himself too old & stern & solemn for the offer of the Serpent to be resisted. 477. The Semites have afØicted mankind with the conception of a God who is a stern & digniÆed king & solemn judge & knows not mirth. But we who have seen Krishna, know Him for a boy fond of play and a child full of mischief & happy laughter. 478. A God who cannot smile, could not have created this humorous universe. 479. God took a child to fondle him in His bosom of delight; but the mother wept & would not be consoled because her child no longer existed. 480. When I suffer from pain or grief or mischance, I say ™So, my old Playfellow, thou hast taken again to bullying me,∫ and I sit down to possess the pleasure of the pain, the joy of the grief, the good fortune of the mischance; then He sees He is found out and takes His ghosts & bugbears away from me. 481. The seeker after divine knowledge Ænds in the description of Krishna stealing the robes of the Gopis one of the deepest parables of God's ways with the soul, the devotee a perfect rendering in divine act of his heart's mystic experiences, the prurient & the Puritan (two faces of one temperament) only a lustful story.

My lover took away my robe of sin and I let it fall, rejoic- ing; then he plucked at my robe of virtue, but I was ashamed and alarmed and prevented him. It was not till he wrested it from me by force that I saw how my soul had been hidden from me. 483. Sin is a trick & a disguise of Krishna to conceal Himself from the gaze of the virtuous. Behold, O Pharisee, God in the sinner, sin in thy self purifying thy heart; clasp thy brother. 484. Love of God, charity towards men is the Ærst step towards perfect wisdom. 485. He who condemns failure & imperfection, is condemning God; he limits his own soul and cheats his own vision. Condemn not, but observe Nature, help & heal thy brothers and strengthen by sympathy their capacities & their courage. 486. Love of man, love of woman, love of things, love of thy neighbour, love of thy country, love of animals, love of humanity are all the love of God reØected in these living images. So love & grow mighty to enjoy all, to help all and to love for ever. 487. If there are things that absolutely refuse to be transformed or remedied into God's more perfect image, they may be de- stroyed with tenderness in the heart, but ruthlessness in the smiting. But make sure Ærst that God has given thee thy sword and thy mission. 488. I should love my neighbour not because he is neighbour- hood, – for what is there in neighbourhood and distance? nor because the religions tell me he is my brother, – for where is the root of that brotherhood? but because he is myself. Neighbour- hood and distance affect the body, the heart goes beyond them. Brotherhood is of blood or country or religion or humanity, but when self-interest clamours what becomes of this brotherhood?

When I live in Krishna, then ego & self-interest vanish and only God himself can qualify my love bottomless & illimitable. 490. Living in Krishna, even enmity becomes a play of love and the wrestling of brothers. 491. To the soul that has hold of the highest beatitude, life cannot be an evil or a sorrowful illusion; rather all life becomes the rippling love and laughter of a divine Lover & Playfellow. 492. Canst thou see God as the bodiless InÆnite & yet love Him as a man loves his mistress? Then has the highest truth of the InÆnite been revealed to thee. Canst thou also clothe the InÆnite in one secret embraceable body and see Him seated in each & all of these bodies that are visible & sensible? Then has its widest & profoundest truth come also into thy possession. 493. Divine Love has simultaneously a double play, an univer- sal movement, deep, calm & bottomless like the nether Ocean, which broods upon the whole world and each thing that is in it as upon a level bed with an equal pressure, and a personal movement, forceful, intense & ecstatic like the dancing surface of the same Ocean, which varies the height & force of its billows and chooses the objects it shall fall upon with the kiss of its foam & spray and the clasp of its engulÆng waters. 494. I used to hate and avoid pain and resent its inØiction; but now I Ænd that had I not so suffered, I would not now possess, trained and perfected, this inÆnitely & multitudinously sensible capacity of delight in my mind, heart and body.

I no longer suffered, but enjoy- ment had passed away from me. Then God broke my heart and ploughed up my mind. I rose through cruel & incessant anguish to a blissful painlessness and through sorrow and indignation & revolt to an inÆnite knowledge and a settled peace. 496. When I found that pain was the reverse side & the training of delight, I sought to heap blows on myself & multiply suffering in all my members; for even God's tortures seemed to me slow & slight & inefÆcient. Then my Lover had to stay my hand & cry, ™Cease; for my stripes are enough for thee.∫ 497. The self-torture of the old monks & penitents was perverse & stupid; yet was there a secret soul of knowledge behind their perversities. 498. God is our wise & perfect Friend; because he knows when to smite as well as when to fondle, when to slay us no less than when to save & to succour. 499. The divine Friend of all creatures conceals His friendliness in the mask of an enemy till He has made us ready for the highest heavens; then, as in Kurukshetra, the terrible form of the Master of strife, suffering & destruction is withdrawn & the sweet face, the tender arm, the oft-clasped body of Krishna shine out on the shaken soul & puriÆed eyes of his eternal comrade & playmate. 500. Suffering makes us capable of the full force of the Master of Delight; it makes us capable also to bear the utter play of the Master of Power. Pain is the key that opens the gates of strength; it is the high-road that leads to the city of beatitude. 501.

Neither do thou inØict pain, O man, on thy fellow; God alone has the right to inØict pain; or those have it whom He has commissioned. But deem not fanatically, as did Torquemada, that thou art one of these. 503. In former times there was a noble form of asseveration for souls compact merely of force and action, ™As surely as God liveth.∫ But for our modern needs another asseveration would suit better, ™As surely as God loveth.∫ 504. Science is chieØy useful to the God-lover & the God- knower because it enables him to understand in detail and admire the curious wonders of His material workmanship. The one learns & cries, ™Behold how the Spirit has manifested itself in matter∫; the other, ™Behold, the touch of my Lover & Master, the perfect Artist, the hand omnipotent.∫ 505. O Aristophanes of the universe, thou who watchest thy world and laughest sweetly to thyself, wilt thou not let me too see with divine eyes and share in thy worldwide laughters? 506. Kalidasa says in a daring image that the snow-rocks of Kailasa are Shiva's loud world-laughters piled up in utter white- ness & pureness on the mountaintops. It is true; and when their image falls on the heart, then the world's cares melt away like the clouds below into their real nothingness. 507. The strangest of the soul's experiences is this, that it Ænds, when it ceases to care for the image & threat of troubles, then the troubles themselves are nowhere to be found in one's neighbour- hood. It is then that we hear from behind those unreal clouds God laughing at us. 508. Has thy effort succeeded, O thou Titan?

But that which thy soul was really hunting after, has escaped from thee. 509. Ravana's mind thought it was hungering after universal sovereignty and victory over Rama; but the aim his soul kept its vision Æxed upon all the time was to get back to its heaven as soon as possible & be again God's menial. Therefore, as the shortest way, it hurled itself against God in a furious clasp of enmity. 510. The greatest of joys is to be, like Naraka, the slave of God; the worst of Hells, being abandoned of God, to be the world's master. That which seems nearest to the ignorant conception of God, is the farthest from him. 511. God's servant is something; God's slave is greater. 512. To be master of the world would indeed be supreme felic- ity, if one were universally loved; but for that one would have to be at the same time the slave of all humanity. 513. After all when thou countest up thy long service to God, thou wilt Ænd thy supreme work was the Øawed & little good thou didst in love for humanity. 514. There are two works that are perfectly pleasing to God in his servant; to sweep in silent adoration His temple-Øoors and to Æght in the world's battleÆeld for His divine consummation in humanity. 515. He who has done even a little good to human beings, though he be the worst of sinners, is accepted by God in the ranks of His lovers and servants. He shall look upon the face of the Eternal. 516.

Sumbha Ærst loved Kali with his heart & body, then was furious with her and fought her, at last prevailed against her, seized her by the hair & whirled her thrice round him in the heavens; the next moment he was slain by her. These are the Titan's four strides to immortality and of them all the last is the longest and mightiest. 519. Kali is Krishna revealed as dreadful Power & wrathful Love. She slays with her furious blows the self in body, life & mind in order to liberate it as spirit eternal. 520. Our parents fell, in the deep Semitic apologue, because they tasted the fruit of the tree of good and evil. Had they taken at once of the tree of eternal life, they would have escaped the immediate consequence; but God's purpose in humanity would have been defeated. His wrath is our eternal advantage. 521. If Hell were possible, it would be the shortest cut to the highest heaven. For verily God loveth. 522. God drives us out [of] every Eden that we may be forced to travel through the desert to a diviner Paradise. If thou wonder why should that parched & Æerce transit be necessary, then art thou befooled by thy mind and hast not studied thy soul behind and its dim desires and secret raptures. 523. A healthy mind hates pain; for the desire of pain that men sometimes develop in their minds is morbid and contrary to Nature. But the soul cares not for the mind & its sufferings any more than the iron-master for the pain of the ore in the furnace; it follows its own necessities and its own hunger."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Bhakti 497 524. Pity is sometimes a good substitute for love; but it is always no more than a substitute. 525. Self-pity is always born of self-love; but pity for others is not always born of love for its object. It is sometimes a self- regarding shrinking from the sight of pain; sometimes the rich man's contemptuous dole to the pauper. Develop rather God's divine compassion than human pity. 526. Not pity that bites the heart and weakens the inner mem- bers, but a divine masterful & untroubled compassion and helpfulness is the virtue that we should encourage. 527. To Ænd that saving a man's body or mind from suffering is not always for the good of either soul, mind or body, is one of the bitterest of experiences for the humanly compassionate. 528. Human pity is born of ignorance & weakness; it is the slave of emotional impressions. Divine compassion understands, discerns & saves. 529. Indiscriminate compassion is the noblest gift of temper- ament, not to do even the least hurt to one living thing is the highest of all human virtues; but God practises neither. Is man therefore nobler and better than the All-loving? 530. Love and serve men, but beware lest thou desire their approbation. Obey rather God within thee. 531. Not to have heard the voice of God and His angels is the world's idea of sanity. 532. See God everywhere and be not frightened by masks. Believe that all falsehood is truth in the making or truth in the breaking, all failure an effectuality concealed, all weakness strength hiding itself from its own vision, all pain a secret & violent ecstasy.

Human love fails by its own ecstasy, human strength is exhausted by its own effort, human knowledge throws a shadow that conceals half the globe of truth from its own sunlight; but divine knowledge embraces opposite truths & reconciles them, divine strength grows by the prodigality of its self-expenditure, divine love can squander itself utterly, yet never waste or diminish. 534. The rejection of falsehood by the mind seeking after truth is one of the chief causes why mind cannot attain to the settled, rounded & perfect truth; not to escape falsehood is the effort of divine mind, but to seize the truth which lies masked behind even the most grotesque or far-wandering error. 535. The whole truth about any object is a rounded & all- embracing globe which for ever circles around, but never touches the one & only subject & object of knowledge, God. 536. There are many profound truths which are like weapons dangerous to the unpractised wielder. Rightly handled, they are the most precious & potent in God's armoury. 537. The obstinate pertinacity with which we cling to our mea- gre, fragmentary, night-besieged & grief-besieged individual ex- istence even while the unbroken bliss of our universal life calls to us, is one of the most amazing of God's mysteries. It is only equalled by the inÆnite blindness with which we cast a shadow of our ego over the whole world & call that the universal being. These two darknesses are the very essence & potency of Maya. 538. Atheism is the shadow or dark side of the highest percep- tion of God.

The religionist speaks a truth, though too violently, when he tells us that even our greatest and purest virtue is as vileness before the divine nature of God. 546.

Circa 1912. The Ærst nine paragraphs were typewritten. Sri Aurobindo subsequently added Æve handwritten paragraphs to the last typed sheet.

However much he disagreed with some of the methods or doctrines of the Theosophical Society, he was well aware of the pioneering work done by this movement, which ™with its compre- hensive combinations of old and new beliefs and its appeal to ancient spiritual and psychic systems, has everywhere exercised an inØuence far beyond the circle of its professed adherents∫ ( The Renaissance in India , CWSA vol. 20, p. 70).

None of the pieces were revised for publication by the author. It has sometimes been necessary for the editors to make judgments as to what his intentions were. In addition, some of the pieces, particularly those from the 1940s, are quite difÆcult to read. The editors have been able to decipher all but a few words; doubtful readings and illegible words are indicated in accordance with the Guide to Editorial Notation. Special problems are discussed in the reference volume. These 171 pieces were never intended to form a single work. The compilation, arrangement and numbering is the responsibility of the editors. They have chosen to arrange the pieces by subject rather than date because a strict chronological arrangement, even if possible, would have resulted in thematic incoherence. A table in the reference volume shows the approximate chronological sequence of the pieces. The material falls into three broad categories, which have been made the main sections of the compilation: philosophy (the princi- ples of things), psychology (the study of consciousness), and yoga. The pieces in each section have been divided into subsections and sub-subsections. A number of the pieces have headings in the manuscript.

One heading used twice by Sri Aurobindo, ™From Man to Superman∫, has been used as the title of this part. Sri Aurobindo usually placed some sort of sign (asterisk, group of asterisks, bar, etc.) to mark his own division of pieces into sections.

Written in or shortly after August 1942, when The Modern Review (Calcutta) published an adverse review of a Sanskrit- Bengali edition of the Gita edited by Anilbaran Roy, a disciple of Sri Aurobindo. The reviewer charged that the Sanskrit phrase par ≈ aprakr . tir j ≈ ıvabh ≈ ut ≈ a (cf. Gita 7.5), translated by Anilbaran according to Sri Aurobindo's interpretation as presented in Essays on the Gita (see CWSA vol. 19, pp. 266, 269 and 519), could not bear the meaning given it, viz., the supreme Nature which has become the j ≈ ıva (individual soul). Sri Aurobindo never published his note. His disciple Kapali Shastri answered the reviewer from a purely grammatical point of view in an article published in the Sri Aurobindo Mandir Annual of 1943 (no. 2, pp. 236 ± 42). 24. Circa 1913. 25.

In or around 1913, Sri Aurobindo wrote 552 aphorisms in a single notebook. In May 1915 and May 1916 he published ten of them in the monthly review Arya . (These ten have not been reproduced here. They form part of Thoughts and Glimpses , included in Essays in Philosophy and Yoga .) Of the 542 aphorisms that remain, two have been classed with the ™Additional Aphorisms∫ (see below). This leaves 540 aphorisms forming the main series of Thoughts and Aphorisms . In the notebook, the aphorisms were written in nine groupings, three of which are headed Jnana, three Karma and three Bhakti. The groupings occur in this order: Jnana, Karma, Bhakti, Karma, Jnana, Bhakti, Karma, Bhakti, Jnana. The editors have placed the three group- ings of Jnana, the three groupings of Karma and the three groupings of Bhakti together. Sri Aurobindo numbered all the aphorisms in Jnana and Karma, none of those in Bhakti. Since it appears that he intended the numbers to form part of the text, the editors have placed a number before each aphorism. These numbers do not correspond to those in the manuscript because the three groupings of each section have been placed together and the unnumbered Bhakti section included. Sri Aurobindo left indications in the manuscript that certain apho- risms were to be moved to a different part or position. For example, he seems to have wanted present aphorisms 240 and 241 to be placed after present aphorism 98. But since some of these manuscript indications are not clear, the editors have followed the original notebook order. The manuscript, entirely handwritten, was revised once or twice by Sri Aurobindo. The original writing is mostly clear, but the revision is sometimes cramped and difÆcult to read. ™Additional Aphorisms∫. The last two aphorisms (541 ± 42) in the notebook containing the main series were not clearly intended for inclusion in the Karma, Jnana or Bhakti sections. The editors have placed them in a separate section along with Æve other aphorisms (543 ± 47) that were written in a different notebook. The handwriting of these last Æve indicates that they were written somewhat later than 1913 – possibly as late as 1919."},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 519 P UBLISHING H ISTORY Some of the material published in this volume was brought out in The Hour of God (Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram) in 1959. This booklet was reprinted in 1964, 1970 and 1973. In 1982 a new, re- organised edition was published. This was reprinted in 1986, 1991 and 1993. Thoughts and Aphorisms was Ærst published by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1958. A second impression of the Ærst edition was issued the next year. New editions textually identical to the Ærst came out in 1968 and 1971. The texts of the fourth (1977) and Æfth (1982) editions each contained corrections of transcription errors. The Æfth edition was reprinted in 1988, 1992 and 1996. In 1971 the contents of the original edition of The Hour of God , along with Thoughts and Aphorisms and other material, were brought out as The Hour of God and Other Writings , volume 17 of the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library. In 1994 those parts of The Hour of God and Other Writings that had not been published during Sri Aurobindo's lifetime, along with other material of the same nature that had not yet been published in a book, were brought out as Essays Divine and Human . The texts of all the pieces were checked against the manuscripts. The present volume is for the most part a reprint of that edition."}]
