vest for his Ethiop breast, Of the threads of my golden hair; And when the broad tent of the firmament Arose on its airy spars, I pencilled the hue of its matchless blue, And spangled it around with stars. I painted the flowers of the Eden bowers, And their leaves of living green, And mine were the dyes in the sinless eyes Of Eden’s Virgin queen; And when the fiend’s art in the truthful heart Hadfasteneditsmortalspell, In the silvery sphere of the first-born tear To the trembling earth I fell. When the waves that burst o’er a world accurst Their work of wrath had sped, And the Ark’s lone few, tried and true, Came forth among the dead, With the wondrous gleams of the bridal beams, I bade their terrors cease, As I wrote on the roll of the storm’s dark scroll God’s covenant of peace. Like a pall at rest on the senseless breast, Night’s funeral shadow slept — Where shepherd swains on Bethlehem’s plains, Their lonely vigils kept, When I flashed on their sight, the heralds bright, Of Heaven’s redeeming plan, As they chanted the morn, the Saviour born — Joy, joy, to the outcast man!"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6 England and Baroda, 1883 – 1898 Equal favour I show to the lofty and low, On the just and the unjust I descend: E’en the blind, whose vain spheres, roll in darkness and tears, Feel my smile — the blest smile of a friend. Nay, the flower of the waste by my love is embraced, As the rose in the garden of kings: At the chrysalis bier of the morn I appear, And lo! the gay butterfly wings. The desolate morn, like the mourner forlorn, Conceals all the pride of her charms, Till I bid the bright hours, chase the night from her flowers, And lead the young day to her arms. And when the gay rover seeks Eve for her lover, And sinks to her balmy repose, I wrap the soft rest by the zephyr-fanned west, In curtains of amber and rose. From my sentinel steep by the night-brooded deep I gaze with unslumbering eye, When the cynosure star of the mariner Is blotted out from the sky: And guided by me through the merciless sea, Though sped by the hurricane’s wings, His companionless, dark, lone, weltering bark, To the haven home safely he brings. I waken the flowers in the dew-spangled bowers, The birds in their chambers of green, And mountain and plain glow with beauty again, As they bask in their matinal sheen.

When earth is full of whispers, when No daily voice is heard of men, But higher audience brings The footsteps of invisible things, When o’er the glimmering tree-tops bowed The night is leaning on a luminous cloud, And always a melodious breeze Sings secret in the weird and charm ` ed trees, Pleasant ’tis then heart-overawed to lie Alone with that clear moonlight and that listening sky. A ETHON But day is sweeter; morning bright Has put the stars out ere the light, And from their dewy cushions rise Sweet flowers half-opening their eyes. O pleasant then to feel as if new-born The sweet, unripe and virgin air, the air of morn. And pleasant are her melodies, Rustle of winds, rustle of trees, Birds’ voices in the eaves, Birds’ voices in the green melodious leaves; The herdsman’s flute among his flocks, Sweet water hurrying from reluctant rocks, And all sweet hours and all sweet showers And all sweet sounds that please the noonday flowers."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"10 England and Baroda, 1883 – 1898 Morning has pleasure, noon has golden peace And afternoon repose and eve the heart’s increase. All things are subject to sweet pleasure, But three things keep her richest measure, The breeze that visits heaven And knows the planets seven, The green spring with its flowery truth Creative and the luminous heart of youth. To all fair flowers and vernal The wind makes melody diurnal. On Ocean all night long He rests, a voice of song. The blue sea dances like a girl With sapphire and with pearl Crowning her locks. Sunshine and dew Each morn delicious life renew. The year is but a masque of flowers, Of light and song and honied showers. In the soft springtide comes the bird Of heaven whose speech is one sweet word, One word of sweet and magic power to bring Green branches back and ruddy lights of spring. Summer has pleasant comrades, happy meetings Of lily and rose and from the trees divinest greetings. G LAUCUS For who in April shall remember The certain end of drear November?

They see her beauty spent, her splendours done; They seek a younger earth, a surer sun. When youth has quenched its soft and magic light, Delightful things remain but dead is their delight. A ETHON Ah! for a little hour put by Dim Hades and his pageantry. Forget the future, leave the past, The little hour thy life shall last. Learn rather from the violet’s days Soft-blooming in retired ways Or dewy bell, the maid undrest With creamy childhood in her breast, Fierce foxglove and the briony And sapphire thyme, the work-room of the bee. Behold in emerald fire The spotted lizard crawl Upon the sun-kissed wall And coil in tangled brake The green and sliding snake Under the red-rose-briar.

Breezes and sunbeams, bees and dews Her lords and lovers she indues, And these her crimson pleasures prove; Her life is but a bath of love; The wide world perfumes when she sighs And, burning all the winds, of love she dies. The lily liveth pure, Yet has she lovers, friends, And each her bliss intends; The bees besides her treasure Besiege of pollened pleasure, Nor long her gates endure. The snowdrop cold Has vowed the saintly state to hold And far from green spring’s amorous guilds Her snowy hermitage she builds. Cowslip attends her vernal duty And stops the heart with beauty.

Love’s feet were on the sea When he dawned on me. His wings were purple-grained and slow; His voice was very sweet and very low; His rose-lit cheeks, his eyes’ pale bloom Were sorrow’s anteroom; His wings did cause melodious moan; His mouth was like a rose o’erblown; The cypress-garland of renown Did make his shadowy crown.

All her wonderful hair Loosened and the wind seized and bore it streaming Over the shoulder of Pururavus And on his cheek a softness. She, o’erborne, Panting, with inarticulate murmurs lay, Like a slim tree half seen through driving hail, Her naked arms clasping his neck, her cheek And golden throat averted, and wide trouble In her large eyes bewildered with their bliss. Amid her wind-blown hair their faces met. With her sweet limbs all his, feeling her breasts Tumultuous up against his beating heart, He kissed the glorious mouth of heaven’s desire. So clung they as two shipwrecked in a surge. Then strong Pururavus, with godlike eyes Mastering hers, cried tremulous: “O beloved, O miser of thy rich and happy voice, One word, one word to tell me that thou lovest.” And Urvasie, all broken on his bosom, Her godhead in his passion lost, moaned out From her imprisoned breasts, “My lord, my love!”"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"CANTO III So was a goddess won to mortal arms; And for twelve months he held her on the peaks, In solitary vastnesses of hills And regions snow-besieged.

And in their third flower-haunted spring of love A child was born from golden Urvasie. But when the goddess from maternal pangs Woke to the child’s sweet face and strange tumult Of new delight and felt the little hands Erring about her breasts, passionate she cried: “How long shall we in woods, Pururavus, Waste the glad days of cheerful human life?

Surely he would arise and lift his bow, And his swift chariot hurling through the gates Advance upon them like a sea, and triumph, And be himself among the rushing wheels.” So they would murmur grieving. But the king When the bright months brought round a lustier earth, Felt over his numbed soul some touch of flowers, And rose a little from his grief, and lifted His eyes against the stars. Then he said low: “I was not wont so quickly to despair. O hast thou left me and art lost in light, Cruel, between the shining hemispheres? Yet even there I will pursue my joy.

His eyes that sought her ever, beheld a wall Of mighty trees and, where they arched to part, Those two of all their sisters brightest rise, One blithe as is a happy brook, the other With her grave smile; and each took a strong hand In her soft clasp, and led him to a place Distinct mid faery-leaved ethereal trees And magic banks and sweet low curves of hills, And over all the sunlight like a charm. There by a sounding river downward thrown From under low green-curtaining boughs was she. Mute she arose and with wide quiet eyes Came towards him. In their immortal looks Was a deep feeling too august for joy, The sense that all eternity must follow One perfect moment. Then that comrade bright With slow grave smile, “O after absence wide Who meet and shall not sunder any more Till slumber of the Supreme, strong be your souls To bear unchanging rapture; strong you were By patience to compel unwilling Gods.” And they were left alone in that clear world.

Over her leaned Ruru, and waited for dead lips to move. Still in the greenwood lay Priyumvada, And Ruru rose not from her, but with eyes Emptied of glory hung above his dead, Only, without a word, without a tear.

They the dead girl Into some distant greenness bore away. But Ruru, while the stillness of the place Remembered her, sat without voice.

There Long months he travelled between grief and grief, Reliving thoughts of her with every pace, Measuring vast pain in his immortal mind. And his heart cried in him as when a fire Roars through wide forests and the branches cry Burning towards heaven in torture glorious.

Earth in the dawn-fire delivered from starry and shadowy vastness Woke to the wonder of life and its passion and sorrow and beauty, All on her bosom sustaining, the patient compassionate Mother. Out of the formless vision of Night with its look on things hidden Given to the gaze of the azure she lay in her garment of greenness, Wearing light on her brow. In the dawn-ray lofty and voiceless Ida climbed with her god-haunted peaks into diamond lustres, Ida first of the hills with the ranges silent beyond her Watching the dawn in their giant companies, as since the ages First began they had watched her, upbearing Time on their summits. Troas cold on her plain awaited the boon of the sunshine. There, like a hope through an emerald dream sole-pacing for ever, Stealing to wideness beyond, crept Simois lame in his currents, Guiding his argent thread mid the green of the reeds and the grasses. Headlong, impatient of Space and its boundaries, Time and its slowness, Xanthus clamoured aloud as he ran to the far-surging waters, Joining his call to the many-voiced roar of the mighty Aegean, Answering Ocean’s limitless cry like a whelp to its parent. Forests looked up through their rifts, the ravines grew aware of their shadows. Closer now gliding glimmered the golden feet of the goddess. Over the hills and the headlands spreading her garment of splendour, Fateful she came with her eyes impartial looking on all things, Bringer to man of the day of his fortune and day of his downfall. Full of her luminous errand, careless of eve and its weeping, Fateful she paused unconcerned above Ilion’s mysteried greatness, Domes like shimmering tongues of t he crystal flames of the morning, Opalesque rhythm-line of tower-tops, notes of the lyre of the sungod.

Over the brooding of plains and the agelong trance of the summits Out of the sun and its spaces she came, pausing tranquil and fatal, And, at a distance followed by the golden herds of the sungod, Carried the burden of Light and its riddle and danger to Hellas. Even as fleets on a chariot divine through the gold streets of ether, Swiftly when Life fleets, invisibly changing the arc of the soul-drift, And, with the choice that has chanced or the fate man has called and now suffers Weighted, the moment travels driving the past towards the future, Only its face and its feet are seen, not the burden it carries. Weight of the event and its surface we bear, but the meaning is hidden. Earth sees not; life’s clamour deafens the ear of the spirit: Man knows not; least knows the messenger chosen for the summons. Only he listens to the voice of his thoughts, his heart’s ignorant whisper, Whistle of winds in the tree-tops of Time and the rustle of Nature. Now too the messenger hastened driving the car of the errand: Even while dawn was a gleam in the east, he had cried to his coursers. Half yet awake in light’s turrets started the scouts of the morning Hearing the jar of the wheels and the throb of the hooves’ exultation, Hooves of the horses of Greece as they galloped to Phrygian Troya. Proudly they trampled through Xanthus thwarting the foam of his anger, Whinnying high as in scorn crossed Simois’ tangled currents, Xanthus’ reed-girdled twin, the gentle and sluggard river. One and unarmed in the car was the driver; grey was he, shrunken, Worn with his decades. To Pergama cinctured with strength Cyclopean Old and alone he arrived, insignificant, feeblest of mortals, Carrying Fate in his helpless hands and the doom of an empire. Ilion, couchant, saw him arrive from the sea and the darkness.

In the dimness and hush of his chamber Charioted far in his dreams amid visions of glory and terror, Scenes of a vivider world, — though blurred and deformed in the brain-cells, Vague and inconsequent, there full of colour and beauty and greatness, — Suddenly drawn by the pull of the conscious thread of the earth-bond And of the needs of Time and the travail assigned in the transience Warned by his body, Deiphobus, reached in that splendid remoteness, Touched through the nerve-ways of life that branch to the brain of the dreamer, Heard the terrestrial call and slumber startled receded Sliding like dew from the mane of a lion.

Nine long years had passed and the tenth now was wearily ending, Years of the wrath of the gods, and the leaguer still threatened the ramparts Since through a tranquil morn the ships came past Tenedos sailing And the first Argive fell slain as he leaped on the Phrygian beaches; Still the assailants attacked, still fought back the stubborn defenders. When the reward is withheld and endlessly lengthens the labour, Weary of fruitless toil grows the transient heart of the mortal.

Always like waves that swallow the shingles, lapsing, returning, Tide of the battle, race of the onset relentlessly thundered Over the Phrygian corn-fields. Trojan wrestled with Argive, Caria, Lycia, Thrace and the war-lord mighty Achaia Joined in the clasp of the fight. Death, panic and wounds and disaster, Glory of conquest and glory of fall, and the empty hearth-side, Weeping and fortitude, terror and hope and the pang of remembrance, Anguish of hearts, the lives of the warriors, the strength of the nations Thrown were like weights into Destiny’s scales, but the balance wavered Pressed by invisible hands.

Life felt a respite from height, the winds breathed freer delivered; Light was released from their blaze and the earth was released from their greatness. But their immortal content from the struggle titanic departed. Vacant the noise of the battle roared like the sea on the shingles; Wearily hunted the spears their quarry; strength was disheartened; Silence increased with the march of the months on the tents of the leaguer. But not alone on the Achaians the steps of the moments fell heavy; Slowly the shadow deepened on Ilion mighty and scornful: Dragging her days went by; in the rear of the hearts of her people Something that knew what they dared not know and the mind would not utter, Something that smote at her soul of defiance and beauty and laughter, Darkened the hours. For Doom in her sombre and giant uprising Neared, assailing the skies: the sense of her lived in all pastimes; Time was pursued by unease and a terror woke in the midnight: Even the ramparts felt her, stones that the gods had erected.

Mute, staring, grey like a wolf descended Old Talthybius, propping his steps on the staff of his errand; Feeble his body, but fierce still his glance with the fire within him; Speechless and brooding he gazed on the hated and coveted city. Suddenly, seeking heaven with her buildings hewn as for Titans, Marvellous, rhythmic, a child of the gods with marble for raiment, Smiting the vision with harmony, splendid and mighty and golden, Ilion stood up around him entrenched in her giant defences. Strength was uplifted on strength and grandeur supported by grandeur; Beauty lay in her lap.

He to the shades of the house and the dreams of the echoing rafters Trusted his high-voiced call, and from chambers still dim in their twilight Strong Aeneas armoured and mantled, leonine striding, Came, Anchises’ son; for the da wn had not found him reposing, But in the night he had left his couch and the clasp of Cre ̈ usa, Rising from sleep at the call of his spirit that turned to the waters Prompted by Fate and his mother who guided him, white Aphrodite. Still with the impulse of speed Thrasymachus greeted Aeneas: “Hero Aeneas, swift be thy stride to the Ilian hill-top.

Doom, we can see it, Glows on their anvils of destiny, clang we can hear of their hammers. Something they forge there sitting unknown in the silence eternal, Whether of evil or good it is they who shall choose who are masters Calm, unopposed; they are gods and they work out their iron caprices. Troy is their stage and Argos their background; we are their puppets. Always our voices are prompted to speech for an end that we know not, Always we think that we drive, but are driven.

Then, in a farewell brief and unthought and unconscious of meaning, Parting they turned to their tasks and their lives now close but soon severed: Destined to perish even before his perishing nation, Back to his watch at the gate sped Thrasymachus rapidly running; Large of pace and swift, but with eyes absorbed and unseeing, Driven like a car of the gods by the whip of his thoughts through the highways, Turned to his mighty future the hero born of a goddess. One was he chosen to ascend into greatness through fall and disaster, Loser of his world by the will of a heaven that seemed ruthless and adverse, Founder of a newer and greater world by daring adventure.

Over the brow he mounted and saw the palace of Priam, Home of the gods of the earth, Laomedon’s marvellous vision Held in the thought that accustomed his will to unearthly achievement And in the blaze of his spirit compelling heaven with its greatness, Dreamed by the harp of Apollo, a melody caught into marble. Out of his mind it arose like an epic canto by canto; Each of its halls was a strophe, its chambers lines of an epode, Victor chant of Ilion’s destiny.

It shall ring like a spear on the hearts of the mighty. Blame not the herald; his voice is an impulse, an echo, a channel Now for the timbrels of peace and now for the drums of the battle. And I have come from no cautious strength, from no half-hearted speaker, But from the Phthian. All know him! Proud is his soul as his fortunes, Swift as his sword and his spear are the speech and the wrath from his bosom. I am his envoy, herald am I of the conquering Argives. Has not one heard in the night when the breezes whisper and shudder, Dire, the voice of a lion unsatisfied, gnawed by his hunger, Seeking his prey from the gods? For he prowls through the glens of the mountains, Errs a dangerous gleam in the woodlands, fatal and silent. So for a while he endures, for a while he seeks and he suffers Patient yet in his terrible grace as assured of his banquet; But he has lacked too long and he lifts his head and to heaven Roars in his wonder, incensed, impatiently. Startled the valleys Shrink from the dreadful alarum, the cattle gallop to shelter. Arming the herdsmen cry to each other for comfort and courage.” So Talthybius spoke, as a harper voicing his prelude Touches his strings to a varied music, seeks for a concord; Long his strain he prepares. But one broke in on the speaker, — Sweet was his voice like a harp’s though heard in the front of the onset, — One of the sons of Fate by the people loved whom he ruined, Leader in counsel and battle, the Priamid, he in his beauty Carelessly walking who scattered the seeds of Titanic disaster. “Surely thou dreamedst at night and awaking thy dreams have not left thee! Hast thou not woven thy words to intimidate children in Argos Sitting alarmed in the shadows who listen pale to their nurses? Greek, thou art standing in Ilion now and thou facest her princes. Use not thy words but thy king’s. If friendship their honey-breathed burden, Friendship we clasp from Achilles, but challenge outpace with our challenge Meeting the foe ere he moves in his will to the clash of encounter.

Freely and not as his vassal who leads, Agamemnon, the Argive, But as a ruler in Hellas I send thee, king of my nations. Long I have walked apart from the mellay of gods in the Troad, Long has my listless spear leaned back on the peace of my tent-side, Deaf to the talk of the trumpets, the whine of the chariots speeding; Sole with my heart I have lived, unheeding the Hellene murmur, Chid when it roared for the hunt the lion pack of the war-god, Day after day I walked at dawn and in blush of the sunset, Far by the call of the seas and alone with the gods and my dreaming, Leaned to the unsatisfied chant of my heart and the rhythms of ocean, Sung to by hopes that were sweet-lipped and vain.

All that was noble in Troy attended the regal procession Marching in front and behind and the tramp of their feet was a rhythm Tuned to the arrogant fortunes of Ilion ruled by incarnate Demigods, Ilus and Phryx and Dardanus, Tros of the conquests, Tros and far-ruling Laomedon who to his soul’s strong labour Drew down the sons of the skies and was served by the ageless immortals. Into the agora vast and aspirant besieged by its columns Bathed and anointed they came like gods in their beauty and grandeur. Last like the roar of the winds came trampling the surge of the people. Clamorous led by a force obscure to its ultimate fatal Session of wrath the violent mighty democracy hastened; Thousands of ardent lives with the heart yet unslain in their bosoms Lifted to heaven the voice of man and his far-spreading rumour.

Some gazed on the greatness of Priam Ancient, remote from their days, the last of the gods who were passing, Left like a soul uncompanioned in worlds where his strength shall not conquer: Sole like a column gigantic alone on a desolate hill-side Older than mortals he seemed and mightier. Many in anger Aimed their hostile looks where calm though by heaven abandoned, Left to his soul and his lucid mind and its thoughts unavailing, Leading the age-chilled few whom the might of their hearts had not blinded, Famous Antenor was seated, the fallen unpopular statesman, Wisest of speakers in Troy but rejected, stoned and dishonoured. Silent, aloof from the people he sat, a heart full of ruins. Low was the rumour that swelled like the hum of the bees in a meadow When with the thirst of the honey they swarm on the thyme and the linden, Hundreds humming and flitting till all that place is a murmur. Then from his seat like a tower arising Priam the monarch Slowly erect in his vast tranquillity silenced the people: Lonely, august he stood like one whom death has forgotten, Reared like a column of might and of silence over the assembly. So Olympus rises alone with his snows into heaven. Crowned were his heights by the locks that swept like the mass of the snow-swathe Clothing his giant shoulders; his eyes of deep meditation, Eyes that beheld now the end and accepted it like the beginning Gazed on the throng of the people as on a pomp that is painted: Slowly he spoke like one who is far from the scenes where he sojourns. “Leader of Ilion, hero Deiphobus, thou who hast summoned Troy in her people, arise; say wherefore thou callest us. Evil Speak thou or good, thou canst speak that only: Necessity fashions All that the unseen eye has beheld.

Fainting your helpers cease from the battle, the nations forsake you. Asia weary of strenuous greatness, ease-enamoured Suffers the foot of the Greek to tread on the beaches of Troas. Yet have we striven for Troy and for Asia, men who desert us. Not for ourselves alone have we fought, for our life of a moment! Once if the Greeks were triumphant, once if their nations were marshalled Under some far-seeing chief, Odysseus, Peleus, Achilles, Not on the banks of Scamander and skirts of the azure Aegean Fainting would cease the audacious emprise, the Titanic endeavour; Tigris would flee from their tread and Indus be drunk by their coursers. Now in these days when each sun goes marvelling down that Troy stands yet Suffering, smiting, alive, though doomed to all eyes that behold her, Flinging back Death from her walls and bronze to the shock and the clamour, Driven by a thought that has risen in the dawn from the tents on the beaches Grey Talthybius’ chariot waits in the Ilian portals, Voice of the Hellene demigod challenges timeless Troya. Thus has he said to us: ‘Know you not Doom when she walks in your heavens? Feelst thou not then thy set, O sun who illuminedst Nature? Stripped of helpers you stand alone against Doom and Achilles, Left by the earth that served you, by heaven that helped you rejected: Death insists at your gates and the flame and the sword are impatient.

Let not your victories deceive you, steps that defeat has imagined; Hear not the voice of your heroes; their fame is a trumpet in Hades: Only they conquer while yet my horses champ free in their stables. Earth cannot long resist the man whom Heaven has chosen; Gods with him walk; his chariot is led; his arm is assisted.’ High rings the Hellene challenge, earth waits for the Ilian answer. Always man’s Fate hangs poised on the flitting breath of a moment; Called by some word, by some gesture it leaps, then ’tis graven, ’tis granite.

Search in your hearts if your fathers still dwell in them, children of Teucer.” So Deiphobus spoke and the nation heard him in silence, Awed by the shadow vast of doom, indignant with Fortune. Calm from his seat Antenor arose as a wrestler arises, Tamer of beasts in the cage of the lions, eyeing the monsters Brilliant, tawny of mane, and he knows if his courage waver, Falter his eye or his nerve be surprised by the gods that are hostile, Death will leap on him there in the crowded helpless arena. Fearless Antenor arose, and a murmur swelled in the meeting Cruel and threatening, hoarse like the voice of the sea upon boulders; Hisses thrilled through the roar and one man cried to another, “Lo he will speak of peace who has swallowed the gold of Achaia! Surely the people of Troy are eunuchs who suffer Antenor Rising unharmed in the agora. Are there not stones in the city? Surely the steel grows dear in the land when a traitor can flourish.” Calm like a god or a summit Antenor stood in the uproar. But as he gazed on his soul came memory dimming the vision; For he beheld his past and the agora crowded and cheering, Passionate, full of delight while Antenor spoke to the people, Troy that he loved and his fatherland proud of her eloquent statesman.

For they look for a nation, One that can conquer itself having conquered the world, but they find none. None has been able to hold all the gods in his bosom unstaggered, All have grown drunken with force and have gone down to Hell and to Ate. ‘All have been thrust from their heights,’ say the fools; ‘we shall live and for ever.

When by the spears overtaken, Strong Sarpedon fell and Zeus averted his visage, Xanthus red to the sea ran sobbing with bodies of Trojans, When in the day of the silence of heaven the far-glancing helmet Ceased from the ways of the fight, and panic slew with Achilles Hosts who were left unshepherded pale at the fall of their greatest, Godlike Troy lived on. Do we speak mid a city’s ruins? Lo! she confronts her heavens as when Tros and Laomedon ruled her. All now is changed, these mutter and sigh to you, all now is ended; Strength has renounced you, Fate has finished the thread of her spinning. Hector is dead, he walks in the shadows; Troilus fights not; Resting his curls on the asphodel he has forgotten his country: Strong Sarpedon lies in Bellerophon’s city sleeping: Memnon is slain and the blood of Rhesus has dried on the Troad: All of the giant Asius sums in a handful of ashes. Grievous are these things; our hearts still keep all the pain of them treasured, Hard though they grow by use and iron caskets of sorrow. Hear me yet, O fainters in wisdom snared by your pathos, Know this iron world we live in where Hell casts its shadow.

Long he pursued not; a shouting broke from that stupor of fury, Men sprang pale to their feet and hurled out menaces lethal; All that assembly swayed like a forest swept by the stormwind. Obstinate, straining his age-dimmed eyes Ucalegon, trembling Worse yet with anger, clamoured feebly back at the people, Whelmed in their roar. Unheard was his voice like a swimmer in surges Lost, yet he spoke. But the anger grew in the throats of the people Lion-voiced, hurting the heart with sound and daunting the nature, Till from some stalwart hand a javelin whistling and vibrant Missing the silvered head of the senator rang disappointed Out on the distant wall of a house by the side of the market. Not even then would the old man hush or yield to the tempest. Wagging his hoary beard and shifting his aged eyeballs, Tossing his hands he stood; but Antenor seized him and Aetor, Dragged him down on his seat though he strove, and chid him and silenced, “Cease, O friend, for the gods have won. It were easier piping High with thy aged treble to alter the rage of the Ocean Than to o’erbear this people stirred by Laocoon. Leave now Effort unhelpful, wrap thy days in a mantle of silence; Give to the gods their will and dry-eyed wait for the ending.” So now the old men ceased from their strife with the gods and with Troya; Cowed by the storm of the people’s wrath they desisted from hoping. But though the roar long swelled, like the sea when the winds have subsided, One man yet rose up unafraid and beckoned for silence, Not of the aged, but ripe in his look and ruddy of visage, Stalwart and bluff and short-limbed, Halamus son of Antenor. Forward he stood from the press and the people fell silent and listened, For he was ever first in the mellay and loved by the fighters. He with a smile began: “Come, friends, debate is soon ended If there is right but of lungs and you argue with javelins. Wisdom Rather pray for her aid in this dangerous hour of your fortunes. Not to exalt Laocoon, too much praising his swiftness, Trojans, I rise; for some are born brave with the spear in the war-car, Others bold with the tongue, nor equal gifts unto all men Zeus has decreed who guides his world in a round that is devious Carried this way and that like a ship that is tossed on the waters."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"378 Pondicherry, c. 1910 – 1920 Why should we rail then at one who is lame by the force of Cronion?

Friends, you have watched me Sometimes fight. Did you see with my house’s allies how I gambolled, Changed, when with sportive spear I was tickling the ribs of my Argives, Nudges of friendly counsel inviting to entry in Troya? Men, these are visions of lackbrains; men, these are myths of the market. Let us have done with them, brothers and friends; hate only the Hellene. Prophet, I bow to the oracles. Wise are the gods in their silence, Wise when they speak; but their speech is other than ours and their wisdom Hard for a mortal mind to hold and not madden or wander; But for myself I see only the truth as a soldier who battles Judging the strength of his foes and the chances of iron encounter. Few are our armies, many the Greeks, and we waste in the combat Bound to our numbers, — they by the ocean hemmed from their kinsmen, We by our fortunes, waves of the gods that are harder to master, They like a rock that is chipped, but we like a mist that disperses.

Pause ere you fling from you life; you are mortals, not gods in your glory. Not for submission to new ally or to ancient foeman Peace these desire; for who would exchange wide death for subjection? Who would submit to a yoke? Or who shall rule Trojans in Troya? Swords are there still at our sides, there are warriors’ hearts in our bosoms.

But now in the Ilian forum Bright, of the sungod a ray, and even before he had spoken Sending the joy of his brilliance into the hearts of his hearers, Paris arose. Not applauded his rising, but each man towards him Eagerly turned as if feeling that all before which was spoken Were but a prelude and this was the note he has waited for always.

Dead is the past; the void has possessed it; its drama is ended, Finished its music. The future is dim and remote from our knowledge; Silent it lies on the knees of the gods in their luminous stillness. But to our gaze God’s light is a darkness, His plan is a chaos. Who shall foretell the event of a battle, the fall of a footstep? Oracles, visions and prophecies voice but the dreams of the mortal, And ’tis our spirit within is the Pythoness tortured in Delphi. Heavenly voices to us are a silence, those colours a whiteness. Neither the thought of the statesman prevails nor the dream of the prophet, Whether one cry, ‘Thus devise and thy heart shall be given its wanting,’ Vainly the other, ‘The heavens have spoken; hear then their message.’ Who can point out the way of the gods and the path of their travel,"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"380 Pondicherry, c. 1910 – 1920 Who shall impose on them bounds and an orbit?

So will I live in my soul’s wide freedom, never in Troya Shorn of my will and disgraced in my strength and the mock of my rivals. First had you yielded, shame at least had not stained your surrender. Strength indulges the weak! But what Hector has fallen refusing, Men! what through ten loud years we denied with the spear for our answer, That what Trojan will ever renounce, though his city should perish? Once having fought we will fight to the end nor that end shall be evil. Clamour the Argive spears on our walls? Are the ladders erected? Far on the plain is their flight, on the farther side of the Xanthus. Where are the deities hostile? Vainly the eyes of the tremblers See them stalking vast in the ranks of the Greeks and the shoutings Dire of Poseidon they hear and are blind with the aegis of Pallas. Who then sustained so long this Troy, if the gods are against her? Even the hills could not stand save upheld by their concert immortal. Now not with Tydeus’ son, not now with Odysseus and Ajax Trample the gods in the sound of their chariot-wheels, victory leading: Argos falls red in her heaps to their scythes; they shelter the Trojans; Victory unleashed follows and fawns upon Penthesilea. Ponder no more, O Ilion, city of ancient Priam! Rise, O beloved of the gods, and go forth in thy strength to the battle. Not by the dreams of Laocoon strung to the faith that is febrile, Nor with the tremblings vain and the haunted thoughts of Antenor, But with a noble and serious strength and an obstinate valour Suffer the shock of your foes, O nation chosen by Heaven; Proudly determine on victory, live by disaster unshaken. Either Fate receive like men, nay, like gods, nay, like Trojans.” So like an army that streams and that marches, speeding and pausing, Drawing in horn and wing or widened for scouting and forage, Bridging the floods, avoiding the mountains, threading the valleys, Fast with their flashing panoply clad in gold and in iron"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Ilion – Book III 387 Moved the array of his thoughts; and throughout delight and approval Followed their march, in triumph led but like prisoners willing, Glad and unbound to a land they desire. Triumphant he ended, Lord of opinion, though by the aged frowned on and censured, But to this voice of their thoughts the young men vibrated wholly. Loud like a storm on the ocean mounted the roar of the people. “Cease from debate,” men cried, “arise, O thou warlike Aeneas! Speak for this nation, launch like a spear at the tents of the Hellene Ilion’s voice of war!” Then up mid a limitless shouting Stern and armed from his seat like a war-god helm ` ed Aeneas Rose by King Priam approved in this last of Ilion’s sessions, Holding the staff of the senate’s authority. “Silence, O commons, Hear and assent or refuse as your right is, masters of Troya, Ancient and sovereign people, act that your kings have determined Sitting in council high, their reply to the strength of Achilles. ‘Son of the Aeacids, vain is thy offer; the pride of thy challenge Rather we choose; it is nearer to Dardanus, King of the Hellenes. Neither shall Helen be led back, the Tyndarid, weeping to Argos, Nor down the paths of peace revisit her fathers’ Eurotas. Death and the fire may prevail o’er us, never our wills shall surrender Lowering Priam’s heights and darkening Ilion’s splendours.

Last Deiphobus rose in their meeting, head of their mellay: “Proudly and well have you answered, O nation beloved of Apollo; Fearless of death they must walk who would live and be mighty for ever.

Ilion turned her thoughts in a proud expectancy seaward Waiting to hear the sounds that she loved and the cry of the mellay. Now to their citadel Priam’s sons returned with their father, Now from the gates Talthybius issued grey in his chariot; But in the halls of Anchises Aeneas not doffing his breastpiece Hastily ate of the corn of his country, cakes of the millet Doubled with wild-deer’s flesh, from the quiet hands of Cre ̈ usa. She, as he ate, with her calm eyes watching him smiled on her husband: “Ever thou hastest to battle, O warrior, ever thou fightest Far in the front of the ranks and thou seekest out Locrian Ajax, Turnest thy ear to the roar for the dangerous shout of Tydides; There, once heard, leaving all thou drivest, O stark in thy courage. Yet am I blest among women who tremble not, left in thy mansion, Quiet at old Anchises’ feet when I see thee in vision Sole with the shafts hissing round thee and say to my quivering spirit, ‘Now he is striking at Ajax, now he has met Diomedes.’ Such are the mighty twain who are ever near to protect thee, Phoebus, the Thunderer’s son, and t hy mother, gold Aphrodite; Such are the Fates that demand thee, O destined head of the future. But though my thoughts for their own are not troubled, always, Aeneas, Sore is my heart with pity for other Ilian women Who in this battle are losing their children and well-loved husbands, Brothers too dear, for the eyes that are wet, for the hearts that are silent. Will not this war then end that thunders for ever round Troya?” But to Cre ̈ usa the hero answered, the son of Anchises: “Surely the gods protect, yet is Death too always mighty.

Blissfullest end is this for a woman here mid earth’s sorrows; Afterwards there we hope that the hands shall join which were parted.” So she spoke, not knowing the gods: but Aeneas departing Clasped his father’s knees, the ancient mighty Anchises. “Bless me, my father; I go to the battle. Strong with thy blessing Even today may I hurl down Ajax, slay Diomedes, And on the morrow gaze on the empty beaches of Troas.” Troubled and joyless, nought replying to warlike Aeneas Long Anchises sat unmoving, silent, sombre, Gazing into his soul with eyes that were closed to the sunlight. “Prosper, Aeneas,” slowly he answered him, “son of a goddess, Prosper, Aeneas; and if for Troy some doom is preparing, Suffer always the will of the gods with a piety constant. Only they will what Necessity fashions compelled by the Silence. Labour and war she has given to man as the law of his transience.

He through the noise and the crowd to Antenor’s high-built mansion Striding came, and he turned to its courts and the bronze of its threshold Trod which had suffered the feet of so many princes departed.

Who shall say that this hand was not chosen to pierce Menelaus? But for a while with the ball should it rather strive, O hero, Till in the play and the wrestle its softness is trained for the smiting.” Eagerly Eurus answered, “But they have told me, Aeneas, This is the last of our fights; for today will Penthesilea Meet Achilles in battle and slay him ending the Argives. Then shall I never have mixed in this war that is famous for ever. What shall I say when my hairs are white like the aged Antenor’s? Men will ask, ‘And what were thy deeds in the warfare Titanic?

Meanwhile girt by his sons and the sons of his sons in his chamber Cried to the remnants left of his blood the aged Antenor. “Hearken you who are sprung from my loins and children, their offspring!

Halamus only replied to his father: “Dire are the white hairs Reverend, loved, of a father, dreadful his curse to his children.

Crossing the hall the son of Antenor and son of Anchises Met in the paths of their fates where they knotted and crossed for the parting, One with the curse of the gods and his sire fast wending to Hades, Fortunate, blessed the other; yet equal their minds were and virtues. Cypris’ son to the Antenorid: “Thee I have sought and thy brothers, Bough of Antenor; sore is our need today of thy counsels, Endless our want of their arms that are strong and their hearts that recoil not Meeting myriads stark with the spear in unequal battle.” Halamus answered him: “I will go forth to the palace of Priam, There where Troy yet lives and far from the halls of my fathers; There will I speak, not here.

But to Antenor the Dardanid born from the white Aphrodite: “Late the Antenorids learn to flinch from the spears of the Argives, Even this boy of their blood has Polydamas’ heart and his valour. Nor should a life that was honoured and noble be stained in its ending. Nay, then, the mood of a child would shame a grey-headed wisdom, If for the fault of the people virtue and Troy were forgotten. For, though the people hear us not, yet are we bound to our nation: Over the people the gods are; over a man is his country; This is the deity first adored by the hearths of the noble. For by our nation’s will we are ruled in the home and the battle And for our nation’s weal we offer our lives and our children’s. Not by their own wills led nor their passions men rise to their manhood, Selfishly seeking their good, but the gods’ and the State’s and the fathers’.” Wroth Antenor replied to the warlike son of Anchises: “Great is the soul in thee housed and stern is thy will, O Aeneas; Onward it moves undismayed to its goal though a city be ruined. They too guide thee who deepest see of the ageless immortals, One with her heart and one in his spirit, Cypris and Phoebus. Yet might a man not knowing this think as he watched thee, Aeneas, ‘Spurring Priam’s race to its fall he endangers this city, Hoping to build a throne out of ruins sole in the Troad.’ I too have gods who warn me and lead, Athene and Hera. Not as the ways of other mortals are theirs who are guided, They whose eyes are the gods and they walk by a light that is secret.” Coldly Aeneas made answer, stirred into wrath by the taunting: “High wert thou always, nurtured in wisdom, ancient Antenor. Walk then favoured and led, yet watch lest passion and evil Feign auguster names and mimic the gait of the deathless.” And with a smile on his lips but wrath in his bosom answered, Wisest of men but with wisdom of mortals, aged Antenor:"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"394 Pondicherry, c. 1910 – 1920 “Led or misled we are mortals and walk by a light that is given; Most they err who deem themselves most from error excluded.

Forth from the halls of Antenor Aeneas rapidly striding Passed once more through the city hurrying now with its car-wheels, Filled with a mightier rumour of war and the march of its thousands, Till at Troy’s upward curve he found the Antenorid crestward Mounting the steep incline that climbed to the palace of Priam White in her proud and arm ` ed citadel.

Surely cords and the rod await thee, Eurus, returning.” Answered with laughter the child, “I have broken through ranks of the fighters, Dived under chariot-wheels to arrive here and I return not. I too for counsel of battle have come to the palace of Priam.” Burdened with thought they mounted slowly the road of their fathers Breasting the Ilian hill where Laomedon’s mansion was seated, They from the crest down-gazing saw their country’s housetops Under their feet and heard the murmur of Troya below them. But in the palace of Priam coming and going of house-thralls Filled all the corridors; smoke from the kitchens curled in its plenty Rich with savour and breathed from the labouring lungs of Hephaestus. Far in the halls and the chambers voices travelled and clustered, Anklets jangling ran and sang back from doorway to doorway Mocking with music of speed and its laughters the haste of the happy, Sound came of arms, there was tread of the great, there were murmurs of women, — Voices glad of the doomed in Laomedon’s marvellous mansion."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Ilion – Book IV 395 Six were the halls of its splendour, a hundred and one were its chambers Lifted on high upon columns that soared like the thoughts of its dwellers, Thoughts that transcended the earth though they sank down at last into ashes; So had Apollo dreamed to his lyre; and its tops were a grandeur Domed, as if seeking to roof men’s lives with a hint of the heavens; Marble his columns rose and with marble his roofs were appointed, Conquered wealth of the world in its largeness suffered, supporting Purities of marble, glories of gold.

Praised to the end the hour when I passed through the doors of my husband Laughing with joy in my heart for the arms that bore and enchained me! Never can Death undo what life has done for us, Paris. Nor, whatsoever betide, can the hour be unlived of our rapture. This too is good that nations should meet in the shock of the battle, Heroes be slain and a theme be made for the songs of the poets, Songs that shall thrill with the na me of Helen, the beauty of Paris.

But I deemed otherwise, urged by the Dreadful One, he who sits always Veiled in us fighting the gods whom he uses.

I have been both, a monster of doom and a portent of beauty.” Slowly Priam the monarch answered to Argive Helen: “That which thou art the gods have ma de thee; thou couldst not be other: That which thou didst, the gods have done; thou couldst not prevent them. Who here shall blame or whom shall he pardon? Should not my people Rail at me murmuring, ‘Priam has lost what his fathers had gathered; Cursed is this king by heaven and cursed who are born as his subjects’? Masked the high gods act; the doer is hid by his working. Each of us bears his punishment, fruit of a seed that’s forgotten; Each of us curses his neighbour protecting his heart with illusions: Therefore like children we blame each other and hate and are angry. Take, my child, the joy of the sunshine won by thy beauty. I who lodge on this earth as an alien bound by the body, Wearing my sorrow even as I wear the imperial purple, Praise yet the gods for my days that have seen thee at last in my ending. Fitly Troy may cease having gazed on thy beauty, O Helen.” He became silent, he ceased from words. But Paris and Helen Lightly went and gladly; pursuing their footsteps the mother, Mother once of Troilus, mother once of Hector, Stood at the door with her death in her eyes, nor returned from her yearning, But as one after a vanishing sunbeam gazes in prison, Gazed down the corridors after him, long who had passed from her vision. Then in the silent chamber Cassandra seized by Apollo Staggered erect and tossing her snow-white arms of affliction Cried to the heavens in her pain; for the fierce god tortured her bosom: “Woe is me, woe for the guile and the bitter gift of Apollo! Woe, thrice woe, for my birth in Troy and the lineage of Teucer! So do you deal, O gods, with those who have served you and laboured, Those who have borne for your sake the evil burden of greatness.

Virtue shall lie in her pangs, for the gods have need of her torture; Sin shall be scourged, though her deeds were compelled by the gods in their anger. None shall avail in the end, the coward shall die and the hero. Troy shall fall in her sin and her virtues shall not protect her; Argos shall grow by her crimes till the gods shall destroy her for ever. Now have I fruit of thy love, O Loxias, dreadful Apollo.

Dim to the thoughts like a vision of Hades the luminous chamber Grew; in his ivory chair King Priam sat like a shadow Throned mid the ghosts of departed kings and forgotten empires. But in his valiance careless and blithe the Priamid hastened Seeking the pillared megaron wide where Deiphobus armoured Waited his coming forth with the warlike chiefs of the Trojans. Now as he passed by the halls of the women, the chambers that harboured Daughters and wives of King Priam and wives of his sons and their playmates, Niches of joy that were peopled with murmurs and sweet-tongued laughters, Troubled like trees with their birds in a morning of sun and of shadow Where in some garden of kings one walks with his heart in the sunshine, Out from her door where she stood for him waiting Polyxena started, Seized his hand and looked in his face and spoke to her brother.

Will she remember it all, my sister Helen, in Argos Passing tranquil days with her husband, bright Menelaus, Holding her child on her knees? But we shall lie joyless in Hades.” Paris replied: “O sister Polyxena, blame me not wholly. We by the gods are ensnared; for the pitiless white Aphrodite Doing her will with us both compels this. Helpless our hearts are And when she drives perforce must love, for death or for gladness: Weighed in unequal scales she deals them to one or another. Happy who holding his love can go down into bottomless Hades.” But to her brother replied in her anguish the daughter of Priam: “Evilly deal with my days the immortals happy in heaven; Yes, I accuse the gods and I curse them who heed not our sorrow. This they have done with me, forcing my heart to the love of a foeman, One whose terrible hands have been stained with the blood of my brothers. This now they do, they have taken the two whom I love beyond heaven, Brother and husband, and drive to the fight to be slain by each other. Nay, go thou forth; for thou canst not help it, nor I, nor can Helen. Since I must die as a pageant to satisfy Zeus and his daughter, Since now my heart must be borne as a victim bleeding to please them, So let it be, let me deck myself and be bright for the altar.” Into her chamber she turned with her great eyes blind, unregarding; He for a moment stood, then passed to the megaron slowly; Dim was the light in his eyes and clouded his glorious beauty.

Near her her captains silent and mighty stood, from the Orient Distant clouds of war, Surabdas and iron Surenas, Pharatus planned like the hills, Somaranes, Valarus, Tauron, High-crested Sumalus, Arithon, Sambus and Artavoruxes.

High on the roofs wouldst thou watch the swaying speck that is battle? Better to aim with the dart or seek with thy kind the palaestra; So wilt thou sooner be part of this greatness rather than straining Yearn from afar to the distance that veils the deeds of the mighty.” But with an anxious lure in his smile on her Eurus answered: “Not that remoteness to see have I come to the palace of Priam Leaving the house of my fathers, but for the spear and the breastpiece. Hast thou not promised me long I shall fight in thy car with Achilles?” Doubtful he eyed her, a lion’s cub at play in his beauty, And mid the heroes who heard him laughter arose for a moment, Yet with a sympathy stirred; they remembered the days of their childhood, Thought of Troy still mighty, life in its rose-touched dawning When they had longed for the clash of the fight and the burden of armour. Glad, with the pride of the lioness watching her cub in the desert, — Couchant she lies with her paws before her and joys in his gambols, Over the prey as he frisks and is careless, — answered the virgin: “Younger than thou in my nation have mounted the steed and the war-car. Eurus, arm; from under my shield thou shalt gaze at the Phthian, Reaching my shafts for the cast from the rim of my car in the battle Handle perhaps the spear that shall smite down the Phthian Achilles. What sayst thou, Halamus? Were not such prowess a perfect beginning Worthy Polydamas’ son and the warlike house of Antenor?” Halamus started and smiting his hand on the grief of his bosom, Sombre replied and threatened with Fate the high-hearted virgin. “Virgin armipotent, wherefore mockst thou thy friend, though unwitting? Nay, — for the world will know at the end and my death cannot hide it, — Slain by a father’s curse we fight who are kin to Antenor. Take not the boy in thy car, lest the Furies, Penthesilea, Aim through the shield and the shielder to wreak the curse of the grandsire. They will not turn nor repent for thy strength nor his delicate beauty.” Swiftly to Halamus answered the high-crested might of the virgin: “Curses leave lightly the lips when the soul of a man is in anger Even as blessings easily crowd round the head that is cherished. Yet have I never seen that a curse has sharpened a spear-point;"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Ilion – Book IV 405 Never Death drew back from the doomed by the power of a blessing. Valour and skill and chance are Fate and the gods and the Furies. Give me the boy; a hero shall come back formed from the onset.” “Do as thou wilt,” replied Halamus; “Fate shall guard or shall end him.” Then to the boy delighted and smiling-eyed and exultant Cried with her voice like the call of heaven’s bugles waking the heroes, Blown by the lips of gold-haired Valkyries, Penthesilea. “Go, find the spear, gird the sword, don the cuirass, child of the mighty. Armed when thou standst on the plain of the Xanthus, field of thy fathers, See that thou fight on this day like the comrade of Penthesilea. Bud of a hero, gaze unalarmed in the eyes of Achilles.” Light as a hound released he ran to the hall of the armour Where were the shields of the mighty, the arms of the mansion of Teucer; There from the house-thralls he wrung the greaves and the cuirass and helmet Troilus wore, the wonderful boy who, ere ripened his prowess, Conquered the Greeks and drove to the ships and fought with Achilles. These on his boyish limbs he donned and ran back exulting Bearing spears and a sword and rejoiced in the clank on his armour. Meanwhile Deiphobus, head of the mellay, moved by Aeneas Opened the doors of their warlike debate to the strength of the virgin: “Well do I hope that our courage outwearying every opponent Triumph shall lift to her ancient seat on the Pergaman turrets; Clouds from Zeus come and pass; his sunshine eternal survives them. Yet we are few in the fight and armoured nations besiege us. Surging on Troy today a numberless foe well-captained Hardly pushed back in shock after shock with the Myrmidon numbers Swelled returns; they fight with a hope that broken refashion Helpful skies and a man now leads them who conquers and slaughters, One of the sons of the gods and armed by the gods for the struggle. We unhelped save by Ares stern and the mystic Apollo And but as mortals striving with stubborn mortal courage, Hated and scorned and alone in the world, by the nations rejected, Fight with the gods and mankind and Achilles and numbers against us Keeping our country from death in this bitter hour of her fortunes.

But for myself from rashness I seek a more far-seeing wisdom, Not behind vain defences choosing a tardy destruction, Rather as Zeus with his spear of the lightning and chariot of tempest Scatters and chases the heavy mass of the clouds through the heavens, So would I hunt the Greeks through the plains to their lair by the Ocean, Straight at the throat of my foeman so would I leap in the battle. Swiftly to smite at the foe is prudence for armies outnumbered.” Then to the Dardanid answered the high-crested Penthesilea: “There where I find my foe I will fight him, whether by Xanthus Or at the fosse of the ships where they crouch behind bulwarks for shelter, Or if they dare by Scamander the higher marching on Troya.” Sternly approved her the Trojan, “So should they fight who would triumph Meeting the foe ere he move in his will to the clash of encounter.” But with his careless laughter the brilliant Priamid Paris: “Joy of the battle, joy of the tempest, joy of the gamble Mated are in thy blood, O virgin, daughter of Ares. Thou like the deathless wouldst have us combat, us who are human? Come, let the gods do their will with us, Ares let lead and his daughter! Always the blood is wiser and knows what is hid from the thinker. Life and treasure and fame to cast on the wings of a moment, Fiercer joy than this the gods have not given to mortals.” Highly to Paris the virgin armipotent Penthesilea, “Paris and Halamus, shafts of the war-god, fear not for Troya. Not as a vaunt do I speak it, you gods who stern-thoughted watch us, But in my vision of strength and the soul that is seated within me, Not while I live and war shall the host of the Myrmidon fighters Forcing the currents lave, as once they were wont, in Scamander Vaunting their victor car-wheels red with the blood of the vanquished. Then when I lie by some war-god slain on the fields of the Troad, Fight again if you will behind high-banked fast-flowing Xanthus.” Halamus answered her, “Never so by my will would I battle Flinging Troy as a stake on the doubtful diceboard of Ares. But you have willed it and so let it be; yet hearken my counsel. Massed in the fight let us aim the storm of our spears at one greatness, Mighty Pelides’ head who gives victory still to the Argives."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Ilion – Book IV 407 Easy the Greeks to destroy lay Achilles once slain on the Troad, But if the Peleid lives the fire shall yet finish with Troya.

Others meanwhile, a puissant screen of our bravest and strongest, Fighting shall hold back Pylos and Argolis, Crete and the Locrian. Thou, Deiphobus, front the bronze-clad stern Diomedes, I with Polydamas’ spear will dare to restrain and discourage Ajax’ feet though they yearn for pursuit and are hungry for swiftness. Knot of retreat behind let some strong experienced captain Stand with our younger levies guarding the fords of the Xanthus, Fortify the wavering line and dawn as fresh strength on the wearied. Then if the fierce gods prevail we shall perish not driven like cattle Over the plains, but draw back sternly and slowly to Troya.” Answered the Priamid, “Wise is thy counsel, branch of Antenor. Chaff are the southern Achaians , only the hardihood Hellene, Only the savage speed of the Locrian rescues their legions. Marshal we so this field. Stand, Halamus, covering Xanthus, Helping our need when the foe press hard on the Ilian fighters. Paris, my brother, thou with our masses aid the Eoan. I with Aeneas’ single spear am enough for the Argive.” “Gladlier” Halamus cried “would I fight in the front with the Locrian! This too let be as you will; for one is the glory and service Fighting in front or guarding behind the fate of our country.” So in their thoughts they ordered battle. Meanwhile Eurus Gleaming returned and the room grew glad with the light of his armour. Glad were its conscious walls of that vision of boyhood and valour; Gods of the household sighed and smiled at his courage and beauty, They who had seen so many pass over their floors and return not Hasting to battle, the fair and the mighty, the curled and the grizzled, All of them treading one path like the conscious masks of one pageant Winding past through the glare of a light to the shadows beyond them. But on her captains proudly smiling Penthesilea Seized him and cried aloud, her wild and warlike nature Moved by the mother’s heart that the woman loses not ever. “Who then shall fear for the fate of Troy when such are her children?

Thou shalt rejoice in our wooded peaks and our fruit-bearing valleys, Lakes of Elysium dreaming and wide and rivers of wonder. All day long thou shalt glide between mystic woodlands in silence Broken only by call of the birds and the plashing of waters. There shalt thou see, O Eurus, the childhood of Penthesilea. Thou shalt repose in my father’s house and walk in the gardens Green where I played at the ball with my sisters, Ditis and Anna.” Musing she ceased, but if any god had touched her with prescience Bidding her think for the last time now of the haunts of her childhood, Gaze in her soul with a parting love at the thought of her sisters And of the lovely and distant land where she played through her summers, Brief was the touch; for she changed at once and only of triumph Dreamed and only yearned in her heart for the shock of Achilles. So they passed from the halls of Priam fated and lofty, Halls where the air seemed sobbing yet with the cry of Cassandra; Clad in their brilliant armour, bright in their beauty and courage, Sons of the passing demigods , they to their latest battle Down the ancestral hill of the Pergamans moved to the gateway. Loud with an endless march, with a tireless gliding to meet them, All Troy streamed from her streets and her palaces armed for the combat. Then to the voice of Deiphobus clanging high o’er the rumour Wide the portals swung that shall close on a blood-red evening, Slow, foreboding, reluctant, and through the yawn of the gateway Drove with a cry her steeds the virgin Penthesilea Calling aloud, “O steeds of my east, we drive to Achilles.” Blithe in the car behind her Eurus scouted around him Scared with his eyes lest Antenor his grandsire should rise in the gateway,"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Ilion – Book IV 409 Hardly believing his fate that led him safe through the portals. After her trampled and crashed the ranks of her orient fighters.

Next Deiphobus drove and the hero strong Aeneas, Leading their numbers on. Behind them Dus and Polites, Helenus, Priam’s son, Thrasymachus, grizzled Aretes, Came like the tempest his father, Adamas, son of the Northwind — Orus old in the fight and Eumachus, kin to Aeneas, Who was Cre ̈ usa’s brother and richest of men in the Troad After Antenor only and Priam, Ilion’s monarch. Halamus drove and Arintheus led on his Lycian levies. Who were the last to speed out of Troya of all those legions Doomed to the sword? for never again from the ancient city Foot would march or chariots crash in their pride to the Xanthus. Aetor the old and Tryas the conqueror known by the Oxus. They in the portals met and their ancient eyes on each other Looked amazed, admiring on age the harness of battle. They in the turreted head of the gateway halted and conversed. “Twenty years have passed, O Tryas, chief of the Trojans, Since in the battle thy car was seen and the arm of thy prowess Age has wronged. Why now to the crowded ways of the battle Move once more thy body infirm and thy eyes that are faded?” And to Antenor’s brother the Teucrian, “Thou too, O Aetor, Old and weary hast sat in thy halls and desisted from battle. Now in Troy’s portals I meet thee driving forth to the mellay.” Aetor answered, “Which then is better, to wretchedly perish Crushed by the stones of my falling house or slain like a victim Dragged through the blood of my kin on the sacred hearth of my fathers, Or in the battle to cease mid the war-cry and hymn of the chariots Knowing that Troy yet stands in her pride though doomed in her morrows? So have the young men willed and the old like thee who age not, Old are thy limbs, but thy heart is still young and hot for the war-din.” Tryas replied, “To perish is better for man or for nation Nobly in battle, nor end disgraced by disease or subjection.

If she must fall, I shall see not her ending.” Aetor replied to Tryas, “Then let us perish together, Joined by the love of our race who in life were divided in counsel. All things embrace in death and the strife and the hatred are ended.” Silent together they drove for the last time through Ilion’s portals Out with the rest to the fight towards the sea and the spears of the Argives. Only once, as they drove, they gazed back silent on Troya Lifting her marble pride in the golden joy of the morning.

Far in front Troy’s plain spread wide to the echoing Ocean."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"BOOK V The Book of Achilles Meanwhile grey from the Trojan gates Talthybius journeyed Spurred by the secret thought of the Fates who change not nor falter. Simois sighed round his wheels and Xanthus roared at his passing, Troas’ god like a lion wroth and afraid; to meet him Whistling the ocean breezes came and Ida regarded. So with his haste in the wheels the herald oceanward driving Came through the gold of the morn, o’er the trampled green of the pastures Back to the ships and the roar of the sea and the iron-hooped leaguer. Wide to the left his circle he wrote where the tents of Achilles Trooped like a flock of the sea-fowl pensive and still on the margin. He past the outposts rapidly coursed to the fosse of the Argives. In with a quavering cry to the encampment over the causeway Bridging the moat of the ships Talthybius drove in his chariot Out of the wide plains azure-roofed and the silence of Nature Passing in to the murmur of men and the thick of the leaguer. There to a thrall of the Hellene he cast his reins and with labour Down from the high seat climbed of the war-car framed for the mighty. Then betwixt tent-doors endless, vistaed streets of the canvas, Slowly the old man toiled with his eager heart, and to meet him Sauntering forth from his tent at the sound of the driving car-wheels Strong Automedon came who was charioteer of Achilles. “Grey Talthybius, whence art thou coming? From Troya the ancient? Or from a distant tent was thy speed and the King Agamemnon? What in their armoured assembly counsel the kings of the Argives?” “Not from the host but from Troy, Automedon, come I with tidings, Nor have I mixed with the Greeks in their cohorts ranked by the Ocean, Nor have I stood in their tents who are kings in sceptred Achaia, But from Achilles sent to Achilles I bring back the message. Tell me, then, what does Pelides, whether his strength he reposes Soothed by the lyre or hearing the chanted deeds of the mighty Or does he walk as he loves by the shore of the far-sounding waters?” And to the Argive herald grey Automedon answered: “Now from the meal he rests and Briseis lyres to him singing One of the Ilian chants of old in the tongue of the Trojans.”"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"412 Pondicherry, c. 1910 – 1920 “Early, then, he has eaten, Automedon, early reposes?” “Early the meat was broached on the spits, Talthybius, early High on the sands or under the tents we have eaten and rested. None knows the hour of the hunt, red, fierce, nor the prey he shall leap on, All are like straining hounds; for Achilles shares not his counsels, But on the ships, in the tents the talk has run like Peneus; These upon Troy to be loosed and the hard-fighting wolf-brood of Priam, These hope starkly with Argos embraced to have done with the Spartan, Ending his brilliance in blood or to sport on the sands of the margent Playing at bowls with the heads of the Cretan and crafty Odysseus. Welcome were either or both; we shall move in the dances of Ares, Quicken heart-beats dulled and limbs that are numb with reposing. War we desire and no longer this ease by the drone of the waters.” So as they spoke, they beheld far-off the tent of Achilles Splendid and spacious even as the hall of a high-crested chieftain, Lofty, held by a hundred stakes to the Phrygian meadow. Hung were its sides with memories bronze and trophies of armour, Sword and spear and helmet and cuirass of fallen heroes Slain by the hand of the mighty Achilles warring with Troya. Teemed in its canvas rooms the plundered riches of Troas, Craftsman’s work and the wood well-carved and the ivory painted, Work of bronze and work of gold and the dreams of the artist. And in those tents of his pride, in the dreadful guard of the Hellene, Noble boys and daughters of high-born Phrygians captive, Borne from the joyless ruins that now were the sites of their childhood, Served in the land of their sires the will of the Phthian Achilles. There on a couch reclined in his beauty mighty and golden, Loved by the Fates and doomed by them, spear of their will against Troya, Peleus’ hero son by the foam-white child of the waters Dreaming reposed and his death-giving hand hung lax o’er the couch-side. Near him dark-eyed Briseis, the fatal and beautiful captive, Sang to the Grecian victor chants of the land of her fathers, Sang the chant of Ilus, the tale of the glories of Troya.

Fain would I fathom What were the thoughts of Deiphobus locked in that nature of iron Now that he stands confronting his fate in the town of his fathers. Peace dwells not in thy aspect. Sowst thou a seed then of ruin Cast from the inflexible heart and the faltering tongue of Aeneas, Or with the golden laugh of the tameless bright Alexander?” Grey Talthybius answered, “Surely their doom has embraced them Wrapping her locks round their ears and their eyes, lest they see and escape her, Kissing their tongue with her fatal lips and dictating its answers. Dire is the hope of their chiefs and fierce is the will of their commons. ‘Son of the Aeacids, spurned is thy offer. The pride of thy challenge Rather we choose; it is nearer to Dardanus, King of the Hellenes.

Nay, if thou hast that strength, then hunt me, O hunter, and seize me, If ’tis thy hope indeed that the sun can turn back from the Orient, But if thou canst not, death of myself or thyself thou shalt capture.’” Musing heard and was silent awhile the strength of Achilles, Musing of Fate and the wills of men and the purpose of Heaven, Then from his thoughts he broke and turned in his soul towards battle. “Well did I know what reply would come winged from the princes of Troya.

Greater it seems to my mind to be king over men than their slayer, Nobler to build and to govern than what the ages have laboured Putting their godhead forth to create or the high gods have fashioned, That to destroy in our wrath of a moment. Ripened, more widely Opens my heart to the valour of man and the beauty of woman, Works of the world and delight; the cup of my victory sweetens Not with the joys of hate, but the human pride of the triumph. Yet was the battle decreed for the means supreme of the mortal Placed in a world where all things strive from the worm to the Titan. So will I seize by the onset what peace from my soul would sequester, So will I woo with the sword and with love the delight of my foeman, Troy and Polyxena, beauty of Paris and glory of Priam. This was the ancient wrestling, this was the spirit of warfare Fit for the demigods. Soon in the city of gold and of marble, There where Ilus sat and Tros, where Laomedon triumphed, Peleus’ house shall reign, the Hellene sit where the Trojan Thought himself deathless. Arise, Automedon! Out to the people! Send forth the cry through the ships and the tents of the Myrmidon nation. Let not a man be found then lingering when o’er the causeway Thunder my chariot-wheels, nor let any give back in the battle, Good if he wills from me, till through the conquered gates of the foeman Storming we herd in their remnants and press into Troy as with evening Helios rushing sinks to the sea. But thou, Briseis, Put by thy lyre, O girl; it shall gladden my heart in my triumph Victor returned from Troy to listen pleased to thy singing, Bearing a captive bound to my car-wheels Penthesilea, Bearing my valour’s reward, Polyxena, daughter of Priam, Won in despite of her city and brothers and spears of her kindred."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"416 Pondicherry, c. 1910 – 1920 So by force it is best to take one’s will and be mighty.” Joyful, Automedon ran through the drowsy camp of the Hellenes Changing the hum of the tents as he raced into shoutings of battle; For with the giant din of a nation triumphant arising Hellas sprang from her irksome ease and mounted her war-car; Donning her armour bright she rejoiced in the trumpets of battle. But to the herald grey the Peleid turned and the old man Shuddered under his gaze and shrank from the voice of the hero: “Thou to the tents of thy Kings, Talthybius, herald of Argos! Stand in the Argive assembly, voice of the strength of Achilles. Care not at all though the greatest and fiercest be wroth with thy message. Deem not thyself, old man, as a body and flesh that is mortal, Rather as living speech from the iron breast of the Hellene. Thus shalt thou cry to the vanquished chiefs who fled from a woman, Thus shalt thou speak my will to the brittle and fugitive legions: ‘Now Achilles turns towards Troya and fast-flowing Xanthus, Now he leaps at the iron zone, the impregnable city. Two were the forms of the Gods that o’erhung the sails of Pelides When with a doubtful word in his soul he came wind-helped from Hellas Cleaving the Aegean deep towards the pine-crested vision of Ida. Two are the Fates that stride with the hero counting his exploits. Over all earthly things the soul that is fearless is master, Only on death he can reckon not whether it comes in the midnight Treading the couch of Kings in their pride or speeds in the spear-shaft. Now will I weigh down that double beam of the Olympian balance Claiming one of the equal Fates that stand robed for the fighter, For to my last dire wrestle I go with the Archer of heaven, And ere the morning gleam have awakened the eagles on Ida, Troy shall lie prone or the earth shall be empty of Phthian Achilles. But for whatever Fate I accept from the ageless Immortals, Whether cold Hades dim or Indus waits for my coming Pouring down vast to the sea with the noise of his numberless waters, I with Zeus am enough. Your mortal aid I desire not, Rushing to Troy like the eagle of Zeus when he flies towards the thunders, — Winged with might, the bird of the spaces, upbuoying his pinions.

Rest, O wearied hosts; my arm shall win for you Troya, Quelled when the stern Eoans break and Penthesilea Lies like a flower in the dust at my feet. Yet if Ares desire you, Come then and meet him once more mid the cry and the trampling! Assemble Round the accustomed chiefs, round the old victorious wrestlers Wearied strengths Deiphobus leaves you or sternest Aeneas. But when my arm and my Fate have vanquished their gods and Apollo, Brilliant with blood when we stand amid Ilion’s marble splendours, Then let none seat deaf flame on the glory of Phrygia’s marbles Or with his barbarous rapine shatter the chambers of sweetness Slaying the work of the gods and the beauty the ages have lived for.

High was his voice like the wind’s when it whistles shrill o’er a forest Sole of all sounds at night, for the kite is at rest and the tiger Sleeps from the hunt returned in the deepest hush of the jungle. “Hearken, O Kings of the world, to the lonely will of the Phthian! One is the roar of the lion heard by the jungle’s hundreds, One is the voice of the great and the many shall hear it inclining.

Shadows are these of the gods which the deep heavens cast on our spirits.

Over the sands they dispersed to their armies ranked by the Ocean. But from the Argive front Acirrous loosed by Tydides Parted as hastens a shaft from the string and he sped on intently Swift where the beaches were bare or threading the gaps of the nations; Crossing Thebes and Epirus he passed through the Lemnian archers, Ancient Gnossus’ hosts and Meriones’ leaderless legions. Heedless of cry and of laughter calling over the sea-sands Swiftly he laboured, wind in his hair and the sea to him crying, Straight he ran to the Myrmidon hosts and the tents of Achilles. There he beheld at his tent-door the Phthian gleaming in armour, Glittering-helmed with the sun that climbed now the cusp of Cronion, Nobly tall, excelling humanity, planned like Apollo.

So in her mood had Fate brought them together, the son and the father, Even as our souls travelling different paths have met in the ages Each for its work and they cling for an hour to the names of affection, Then Time’s long waves bear them apart for new forms we shall know not, So these two long severed had met in the shadow of parting. Often he smote his hand on the thigh-piece for sound of the armour, Bent his ear to the plains or restless moved like a war-horse Curbed by his master’s will, when he stands new-saddled for battle Hearing the voice of the trumpets afar and pawing the meadows. Over the sands Acirrous came to them running and toiling, Known from far off, for he ran unhelmeted.

Bringest thou flattery pale or an empty and futureless menace?” But to the strength of Pelides the hero Acirrous answered: “Response none make the Greeks to thy high-voiced message and challenge; Only their shout at thy side will reply when thou leapst into Troya. So have their chieftains willed and the wisdom calm of Odysseus.” But with a haughty scorn made answer the high-crested Hellene: “Wise is Odysseus, wise are the hearts of Achaia’s chieftains. Ilion’s chiefs are enough for their strength and life is too brittle Hurrying Fate to advance on the spear of the Phthian Achilles.” “Not from the Greeks have I sped to thy tents, their friendship or quarrel Urged not my feet; but Tiryns’ chieftain strong Diomedes Sent me claiming a word long old that first by his war-car Young Neoptolemus come from island Scyros should enter Far-crashing into the fight that has lacked this shoot of Achilles, Pressing in front with his father’s strength in the playground of Ares, Shouting his father’s cry as he clashed to his earliest battle.

He on the shoulder white of his son with a gesture of parting Laid his fateful hand and spoke from his prescient spirit: “Pyrrhus, go. No mightier guide couldst thou hope into battle Opening the foemen’s ranks than the hero stern Diomedes. Noble that rugged heart, thy father’s friend and his father’s. Journey through all wide Greece, seek her prytanies, schools and palaestras, Traverse Ocean’s rocks and the cities that dream on his margin, Phocian dales, Aetolia’s cliffs and Arcady’s pastures, Never a second man wilt thou find, but alone Diomedes. Pyrrhus, follow his counsels always losing thy father, If in this battle I fall and Fate has denied to me Troya. Pyrrhus, be like thy father in virtue, thou canst not excel him; Noble be in peace, invincible, brave in the battle, Stern and calm to thy foe, to the suppliant merciful. Mortal Favour and wrath as thou walkst heed never, son of Achilles. Always thy will and the right impose on thy friend and thy foeman. Count not life nor death, defeat nor triumph, Pyrrhus. Only thy soul regard and the gods in thy joy or thy labour.” Pyrrhus heard and erect with a stride that was rigid and stately Forth with Acirrous went from his sire to the joy of the battle. Little he heeded the word of death that the god in our bosom Spoke from the lips of Achilles, but deemed at sunset returning, Slaying Halamus, Paris or dangerous mighty Aeneas, Proudly to lay at his father’s feet the spoils of the foeman. But in his lair alone the godlike doomed Pelides Turned to the door of his tent and was striding forth to the battle, When from her inner chamber Briseis parting the curtain, — Long had she stood there spying and waiting her lonely occasion, — Came and caught and held his hand like a creeper detaining Vainly a moment the deathward stride of the kings of the forest. “Tarry awhile, Achilles; not yet have the war-horns clamoured, Nor have the scouts streamed yet from Xanthus fierily running.

Others have whispered the deeds of thy wrath; we have heard, but not seen it; Marvelling much at their pallor and awe we have listened and wondered.

Over the sea in my dream an argent bow was extended; Nearing I saw a terror august over moonlit waters, Cloud and a fear and a face that was young and lovely and hostile. Then three times I heard arise in the grandiose silence, — Still was the sky and still was the land and still were the waters, — Echoing a mighty voice, ‘Take back, O King, what thou gavest; Strength, take thy strong man, sea, take thy wave, till the warfare eternal Need him again to thunder through Asia’s plains to the Ganges.’"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Ilion – Book VII 439 That fell silent, but nearer the beautiful Terror approached me, Clang I heard of the argent bow and I gazed on Apollo.

Lo, in the night came this dream; on the morn thou arisest for battle.” But to Briseis white-armed made answer the golden Achilles: “This was a dream indeed, O princess, daughter of Brises! Will it restrain Achilles from fight, the lion from preying? Come, thou hast heard of my prowess and knowest what man is Achilles. Deemst thou so near my end? or does Polyxena vex thee, Jealousy shaping thy dreams to frighten me back from her capture?” Passionate, vexed Briseis, smiting his arm with her fingers, Yet with a smile half-pleased made answer to mighty Achilles. “Thinkst thou I fear thee at all? I am brave and will chide thee and threaten. See that thou recklessly throw not, Achilles, thy life into battle Hurting this body, my world, nor venture sole midst thy foemen, Leaving thy shielders behind as oft thou art wont in thy war-rage Lured by thy tempting gods who seek their advantage to slay thee, Fighting divinely, careless of all but thy spear and thy foeman. Cover thy limbs with thy shield, speed slowly restraining thy coursers. Dost thou not know all the terrible void and cold desolation Once again my life must become if I lose thee, Achilles? Twice then thus wilt thou smite me, O hero, a desolate woman? I will not stay behind on an earth that is empty and kingless. Into the grave I will leap, through the fire I will burn, I will follow Down into Hades’ depths or wherever thy footsteps go clanging, Hunting thee always, — didst thou not seize me here for thy pleasure? — Stronger there by my love as thou than I here, O Achilles. Thou shalt not dally alone with Polyxena safe in the shadows.” But to Briseis answered the hero, mighty Pelides, Holding her delicate hands like gathered flowers in his bosom, Pressing her passionate mouth like a rose that trembles with beauty. “There then follow me even as I would have drawn thee, O woman, Voice that chimes with my soul and hands that are eager for service, Beautiful spoil beloved of my foemen, perfect Briseis."},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"440 Pondicherry, c. 1910 – 1920 But for the dreams that come to us mortals sleeping or waking, Shadows are these from our souls and who shall discern what they figure?

There in the champaigns unending battle the gods and the giants, There in eternal groves the lovers have pleasure for ever, There are the faery climes and there are the wonderful pastures. Some from a marvellous Paradise hundred-realmed in its musings, Million-ecstasied, climbed like flames that in silence aspire Windless, erect in a motionless dream, yet ascending for ever.

Up the vast incline Shaking the world with the force of his advent thundered Poseidon; Space grew full of his stride and his cry. Immortal Apollo Shone and his silver clang was heard with alarm in our kingdoms.

But we have coarsened in heart and in mood; we have turned in our natures Nearer our poorer kindred; leaned to the ant and the ferret. Sight we have darkened with sense and power we have stifled with labour, Likened in mood to the things we gaze at and are in our vestures: Therefore we toil unhelped; we are left to our weakness and blindness. Not in those veils now they rose to their skies, but like loose-fitting mantles Dropped in the vestibules huge of their vigorous realms that besiege us All that reminded of earth; then clothed with raiment of swiftness Straight they went quivering up in a glory like fire or the storm-blast.

Nothing they perfectly see, but all things seek and imagine, Out of the clod who have come and would climb from their mire to our heavens. Yet are the heavenly seats not easy even for the chosen: Rough and remote is that path; that ascent is too hard for the death-bound. Hard are God’s terms and few can meet them of men who are mortal. Mind resists; their breath is a clog; by their tools they are hampered, Blindly mistaking the throb of their mortal desires for our guidance. How shall they win in their earth to our skies who are clay and a life-wind, But that their hearts we invade? Our shocks on their lives come incessant, Ease discourage and penetrate coarseness; sternness celestial Forces their souls towards the skies and their bodies by anguish are sifted. We in the mortal wake an immortal strength by our tortures And by the flame of our lightnings choose out the vessels of godhead. This is the nature of earth that to blows she responds and by scourgings Travails excited; pain is the bed of her blossoms of pleasure. Earth that was wakened by pain to life and by hunger to thinking Left to her joys rests inert and content with her gains and her station. But for the unbearable whips of the gods back soon to her matter She would go glad and the goal would be missed and the aeons be wasted.

This by pain we prevent; we compel his feet to the journey. But in their minds to impression made subject, by forms of things captured Blind is the thought and presumptuous the hope and they swerve from our goading; Blinded are human hearts by desire and fear and possession, Darkened is knowledge on earth by hope the helper of mortals. “Now too from earth and her child ren voices of anger and weeping Beat at our thrones; ’tis the grief and the wrath of fate-stricken creatures, Mortals struggling with destiny, hearts that are slaves to their sorrow.

Troy that displaced with her force and her arms the luminous ancients, Sinks in her turn by the ruder strength of the half-savage Achaians. They to the Hellene shall yield and the Hellene fall by the Roman. Rome too shall not endure, but by strengths ill-shaped shall be broken, Nations formed in the ice and mist, confused and crude-hearted. So shall the darker and ruder always prevail o’er the brilliant Till in its turn to a ruder and darker it falls and is shattered. So shall mankind make speed to destroy what ’twas mighty creating. Ever since knowledge failed and the ancient ecstasy slackened, Light has been helper to death and darkness increases the victor. So shall it last till the fallen ages return to their greatness.

This is the greatness of gods that they know and can put back the knowledge; Doing the work they have chosen they turn not for fruit nor for failure, Griefless they walk to their goal and strain not their eyes towards the ending. Light that they have they can lose with a smile, not as souls in the darkness Clutch at every beam and mistake their one ray for all splendour.

I will not dwell with the Greeks nor aid them save forced by Ananke And because lives of the great and the blood of the strong are my portion. This too thou knowest, our nature enjoys in mankind its fulfilment. War is my nature and greatness and hardness, the necks of the vanquished; Force is my soul and strength is my bosom; I shout in the battle Breaking cities like toys and the nations are playthings of Ares: Hither and thither I shove them and throw down or range on my table. Constancy most I love, nobility, virtue and courage; Fugitive hearts I abhor and the nature fickle as sea-foam. Now if the ancient spirit of Titan battle is over, — Tros fights no more on the earth, nor now Heracles tramples and struggles, Bane of the hydra or slaying the Centaurs o’er Pelion driven, — Now if the earth no more must be shaken by Titan horsehooves, Since to a pettier framework all things are fitted consenting, Yet will I dwell not in Greece nor favour the nurslings of Pallas. I will await the sons of my loins and the teats of the she-wolf, Consuls browed like the cliffs and plebeians stern of the wolf-brood, Senates of kings and armies of granite that grow by disaster; Such be the nation august that is fit for the favour of Ares! They shall fulfil me and honour my mother, imperial Hera. Then with an iron march they shall move to their world-wide dominion, Through the long centuries rule and at last because earth is impatient, Slowly with haughtiness perish compelled by mortality’s transience Leaving a Roman memory stamped on the ages of weakness.” But to his son far-sounding the Father high of the Immortals: “So let it be since such is the will in thee, mightiest Ares; Thou shalt till sunset prevail, O war-god, fighting for Troya.” So he decreed and the soul of the Warrior sternly consented. He from his seats arose and down on the summits of Ida Flaming through Space in his cloud in a headlong glory descended, Prone like a thunderbolt flaming down from the hand of the Father.

Choose thou thy paths, O my daughter, More than thy brother assailed by the night that darkens o’er creatures. Choose the silence in heaven or choose the struggle mid mortals, Golden joy of the worlds, O thou roseate white Aphrodite.” Then with her starry eyes and bosom of bliss from the immortals Glowing and rosy-limbed cried the wonderful white Aphrodite, Drawing her fingers like flowers through the flowing gold of her tresses, Calm, discontented, her perfect mouth like a rose of resistance Chidingly budded ’gainst Fate, a charm to their senses enamoured. “Well do I know thou hast given my world to Hera and Pallas. What though my temples shall stand in Paphos and island Cythera And though the Greek be a priest for my thoughts and a lyre for my singing, Beauty pursuing and light through the figures of grace and of rhythm, — Forms shall he mould for men’s eyes that the earth has forgotten and mourns for, Mould even the workings of Pallas to commune with Paphia’s sweetness, Mould Hephaestus’ craft in the gaze of the gold Aphrodite, — Only my form he pursues that I wear for a mortal enchantment, He to whom now thou givest the world, the Ionian, the Hellene, But for my might is unfit which Babylon worshipped and Sidon Palely received from the past in images faint of the gladness Once that was known by the children of men when the thrill of their members Was but the immortal joy of the spirit overflowing their bodies, Wine-cups of God’s desire; but their clay from my natural greatness Falters betrayed to pain, their delight they have turned into ashes. Nor to my peaks shall he rise and the perfect fruit of my promptings, There where the senses swoon but the heart is delivered by rapture: Never my touch can cling to his soul nor reply from his heart-strings.

For I danced on Taygetus’ peaks and o’er Ida Naked and loosing my golden hair like a nimbus of glory O’er a deep-ecstasied earth that was drunk with my roses and whiteness. There was no shrinking nor veil in our old Saturnian kingdoms. Equals were heaven and earth, twin gods on the lap of Dione. Now shall my waning greatness perish and pass out of Nature. For though the Romans, my children, shall grasp at the strength of their mother, They shall not hold the god, but lose in unsatisfied orgies Yet what the earth has kept of my joy, my glory, my puissance, Who shall but drink for a troubled hour in the dusk of the sunset Dregs of my wine Pandemian missing the Uranian sweetness.

Bees that sting and delight are the words from thy lips, Cytherea. Art thou not womb of the world and from thee are the thronging of creatures?

How will you do then without me your works of wisdom and greatness, Hera, queen of heaven, and thou, O my sister Athene? Yes, I shall reign and endure though t he pride of my workings be conquered.

Jealous for truth to the end my might shall prevail and for ever Shatter the moulds that men make to imprison their limitless spirits. Dire, overpowering the brain I shall speak out my oracles splendid. Then in their ages of barren light or lucidity fruitful Whenso the clear gods think they have conquered earth and its mortals, Hidden God from all eyes, they shall wake from their dream and recoiling Still they shall find in their paths the fallen and darkened Apollo.” So he spoke, repressing his dreadful might in his bosom, And from their high seats passed, his soul august and resplendent"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Ilion – Book VIII 455 Drawn to the anguish of men and the fierce terrestrial labour.

Over the summits descending that slept in the silence of heaven, He through the spaces angrily drew towards the tramp and the shouting Over the speeding of Xanthus and over the pastures of Troya. Clang of his argent bow was the wrath restrained of the mighty, Stern was his pace like Fate’s; so he came to the warfare of mortals And behind Paris strong and inactive waited God’s moment Knowing what should arrive, nor disturbed like men by their hopings.

Blue are my waves and they call men’s hearts to wealth and adventure. Lured by the shifting surges they launch their delight and their treasures Trusting the toil of years to the perilous moments of Ocean. Huge man’s soul in its petty frame goes wrestling with Nature Over her vasts and his fragile ships between my horizons Buffeting death in his solitudes labour through swell and through storm-blast Bound for each land with her sons and watched for by eyes in each haven.

Now all your will shall be done, so you give me the earth for my nations. Gold shall make men like gods and bind their thoughts into oneness; Peace I will build with gold and heaven with the pearls of my caverns.” Smiling replied to his brother’s craft the mighty Cronion: “Lord of the boundless seas, Poseidon, soul of the surges, Well thou knowest that earth shall be seized as a booth for the trader. Rome nor Greece nor France can drive back Carthage for ever. Always each birth of the silence attaining the field and the movement Takes from Time its reign; for it came for its throne and its godhead.

Wisdom is with thee, Therefore thou know’st and obeyest. Submission is wisdom and knowledge; He who is blind revolts and he who is limited struggles: Strife is not for the infinite; wisdom observes to accomplish. Troy and her sons and her works are thy food today, O Hephaestus.” And to his father the Toiler answered, the silent Seer: “Yes, I obey thee, my Father, and That which than thou is more mighty; Even as thou obeyest by rule, so I by my labour. Now must I heap the furnace, now must I toil at the smithy, I who have flamed on the altar of sacrifice helping the sages. I am the Cyclops, the lamester, who once was pure and a high-priest. Holy the pomp of my flames ascendant from pyre and from altar Robed men’s souls for their heavens and my smoke was a pillar to Nature. Though I have burned in the sight of the sage and the heart of the hero, Now is no nobler hymn for my ear than the clanging of metal, Breath of human greed and the dolorous pant of the engines. Still I repine not, but toil; for to toil I was yoked by my Maker. I am your servant, O Gods, and his of whom you are servants.” But to the toiler Zeus replied, to the servant of creatures: “What is the thought thou hast uttered betrayed by thy speech, O Hephaestus? True is it earth shall grow as a smithy, the smoke of the furnace Fill men’s eyes and their souls shall be stunned with the clang of the hammers; Yet in the end there is rest on the peak of a labour accomplished. Nor shall the might of the thinker be quelled by that iron oppression, Nor shall the soul of the warrior despair in the darkness triumphant; For when the night shall be deepest, dawn shall increase on the mountains And in the heart of the worst the best shall be born by my wisdom. Pallas thy sister shall guard man’s knowledge fighting the earth-smoke. Thou too art mighty to live through the clamour even as Apollo. Work then, endure; expect from the Silence an end and thy wages.” So King Hephaestus arose and passed from the courts of his father; Down upon earth he came with his lame omnipotent motion; And with uneven steps absorbed and silent the Master Worked employed mid the wheels of the cars as a smith in his smithy, But it was death and bale that he forged, not the bronze and the iron.

But on the ranks of the Hellenes fear and amazement descended, — Messengers they from Zeus to discourage the pride and the blood-lust. Back many yards their foremost recoiled in a god-given terror, As from a snake a traveller scorned for a bough by the wayside, But it arises puffing its hood and hisses its hatred. Forward the henchmen ran and plucked back the spears from the corpses; Onward the Eoan thousands rolled o ’er the ground that was conquered Trampling the fallen men into earth with the wheels of their war-cars. But in her speed like the sea or the stormwind Penthesilea Drove towards the ranks of the foe and her spear-shafts hastened before her, Messengers whistling shrilly to Death; he came like a wolfhound Called by his master’s voice and silently fell on the quarry.

But though their hands were mighty, though fierce their obdurate natures, Mightier strengths they met and a sterner brood of the war-god.

None now dared to confront her burning eyes; the boldest Shuddered back from her spear and the cry of her tore at their heart-strings. Fear, the daughter of Zeus, had gripped at the hearts of the Hellenes. So as their heroes yielded before her, Penthesilea Lifted with victory cried to her henchman, Aurus of Ellae, Who had the foot of the wind and its breath that scants not for running, “Hasten, hasten, Aurus; race to the right where unwarring Valarus leads his host; bid him close with the strength of the Hellenes.

Shaped like a woman clad in armour and fleeing from battle, Helmed with the Hellene crest it knocked at the gates of his spirit Shaking the hero’s heart with the vision that came to his eyeballs; Silent he stared aghast and turned his ear to the war-din. “Dost thou not hear to our right, Achilles, these voices of Ares? High is the sound of Eoan battle, a woman’s war-cry Rings in my ears, but faint and sparse come the shouts of our nation. Far behind is their call and nearer the ships and the beaches.” Great Pelides heard and groaned in the caves of his spirit: “It is the doom that I feared and the fatal madness of Zethus; Slain are the men of my nation or routed by Penthesilea."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Ilion – Book IX 471 Drive, Automedon, drive, lest shame and defeat upon Hellas Fasten their seal and her heroes flee from the strength of a woman.” And to the steeds divine Automedon called and they hearkened, Rose as if seeking their old accustomed paths in the heavens, Then through the ranks that parted the y galloped as gallops the dust-cloud When the cyclone is abroad and the high trees snap by the wayside, And from the press of the Hellenes into the plain of the Xanthus Thundering, neighing came with the war-car borne like a dead leaf Chased by the blast. Then Athene opened the eyes of Achilles, Eyes that in all of us sleep, yet can see the near and the distant, Eyes that the gods in their pity have sealed from the giant confusion, Sealed from the bale and the grief. He saw like one high on a summit Near him the Eoans holding the plain and out in the distance Breaking the Hellene strengths. Like a dream in the night he regarded High-crested Sumalus fight, Somaranes swift in the onset, Bull-shouldered Tauron’s blows and the hero Artavoruxes. But in the centre fiercest the cry and the death and the fleeing. There were his chieftains ever reforming vainly resistance, — Even in defeat these were Hellenes and fit to be hosts of Achilles, — But like a doom on them thundered the war-car of Penthesilea, Pharatus smote and Surabdas and Sambus and iron Surenas.

Echemus followed, Ascanus dr ove and Drus and Thretaon: Phoces alone in the dust of the Troad lay there and moved not. Yet brought not all of them help to the ir brothers oppressed in the combat: For from the forefront forth on the knot of the swift-speeding war-cars High an Eoan chariot came drawn fast by its coursers Bearing a mighty chieftain, Valarus son of Supaures. Fire-footed thundered past him the hooves of the heavenly coursers, Nor to his challenging shout nor his spear the warlike Pelides Answered at all, but made haste like a flood to the throng and the mellay. But twixt the chariots behind and their leader the mighty Eoan Drove his dark-maned steeds and stood like a cliff to their onset. “Great is your haste, O ye Kings of the Greeks!

Weak are men’s arms, it seems, in Hellas; a boy there Ares Aims with reeds not spears at pastoral cheeses not iron. Judge now my strength.” Two spears from him ran at the hearts of his foemen.

Strong Thretaon missed, but Echemus’ point at the helmet Bit and fastened as fastens a hound on the ear of the wild-boar Wroth with the cry and the hunt that gores the pack and his hunters.

The first is a kind of compromise between the stress system and the foot measure. The stanza is of four lines, alternately of twelve and ten stresses. The second and fourth line in each stanza can be read as a ten-foot line of mixed iambs and anapaests, the first and third, though a similar system subject to replacement of a foot anywhere by a single-syllable half-foot could be applied, are still mainly readable by stresses. The other poem is an experiment in the use of quantita- tive foot measures not following any existing model, but freely invented. It is a four-line stanza reading alternately \u0001 \u0001 | \u0001 \u0001 | \u0001 | \u0001 | \u0001 | and \u0001 | \u0001 \u0001 | \u0001 \u0001 | It could indeed be read otherwise, in several ways, but read in the ordinary way of accentual feet it would lose all lyrical quality and the soul of its rhythm.

S HIVA — The Inconscient Creator The quantitative metre of Trance is suited only for a very brief lyrical poem. For longer poems I have sought to use it as a base but to liberate it by the introduction of an ample number of modulations which allow a fairly free variation of the rhythm without destroying the consistency of the underlying rhythmic measure. This is achieved in Shiva by allowing as the main mod- ulations (1) a paeon anywhere in place of an amphibrach, (2) the"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"Six Poems 555 substitution of a long for a short syllable either in the first or the last syllable of an amphibrach, at will, thus substituting a bacchius or an antibacchius, (3) the substitution of a dactyl for an initial amphibrach, (4) the substitution of a long instead of short syllable in the middle of the final anapaest, both this and the ultimate syllable to be in that case stressed in reading, e.g., deathless | and lo | ne he | ad — a bacchius replacing the anapaest. The suppression of the full value of long syllables to make them figure as metrical shorts has to be avoided in quantitative metre.

The Inconscient as the source and author of all material creation is one of the main discoveries of modern psychology, but it agrees with the idea of a famous Vedic hymn. In the Upanishads, Prajna, the Master of Sushupti, is the Ishwara and therefore the original Creator out of a superconscient sleep. The idea of the poem is that this creative Inconscient also is Shiva creating here life in matter out of an apparently inconscient material trance as from above he creates all the worlds (not the material only) from a superconscient trance. The reality is a supreme Consciousness — but that is veiled by the appearance on one side of the superconscient sleep, on the other of the material Inconscience. Here the emphasis is on the latter; the superconscient is only hinted at, not indicated, — it is the Infinity out of which comes the revealing Flame."},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"556 Pondicherry, c. 1927 – 1947 T HE L IFE H EAVENS Further modulations have been introduced in this poem — a greater use is made of tetrasyllabic feet such as paeons, epitrites, di-iambs, double trochees, ionics and, once only, the antispast — and in a few places the foot of three long syllables (molossus) has been used, and in others a foot extending to five syllables (e.g., De ̆ li _ ve ̆ red fro ̆ mgri _ ef).

There were two places in which at the time of writing there did not seem to me to be a satisfactory completeness and the addition of a stanza seemed to be called for — one at the end of the description of the Life Heavens, a stanza which would be a closing global description of the essence of the vital Heavens, the other (less imperatively called for) in the utterance of the Voice. There it is no doubt very condensed, but it cannot be otherwise. I thought, however, that one stanza might be added hinting rather than stating the connection between the two extremes. The con- nection is between the Divine suppressed in its opposites and the Divine eternal in its own unveiled and undescended nature. The idea is that the other worlds are not evolutionary but typal and each presents in a limited perfection some aspect of the Infinite, but each complete, perfectly satisfied in itself, not asking or aspiring for anything else, for self-exceeding of any kind. That aspiration, on the contrary, is self-imposed on the imperfection of Earth; the very fact of the Divine being there, but suppressed in its phenomenal opposites, compels an effort to arrive at the unveiled Divine — by ascent, but also by a descent of the Divine Perfection for evolutionary manifestation here. That is why the Earth declares itself a deeper Power than Heaven because it holds"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Six Poems 557 in itself that possibility implied in the presence of the suppressed Divine here, — which does not exist in the perfection of the vital (or even the mental) Heavens. J IVANMUKTA Written in Alcaics. These Alcaics are not perhaps very orthodox. I have treated the close of the first two lines not as a dactyl but as a cretic and have taken the liberty in any stanza of turning this into a double trochee. In one closing line I have started the dactylic run with two short preliminary syllables and there is occasionally a dactyl or anapaest in unlawful places; the dactyls too are not all pure dactyls. The object is to bring in by modula- tions some variety and a more plastic form and easier run than strict orthodoxy could give. But in essence, I think, the alcaic movement remains in spite of these departures. The basic form of this Alcaic would run, 1, 2 \u0001 | \u0001 | \u0001 || \u0001\u0001 | \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 3 \u0001 | \u0001 | \u0001 | \u0001 | \u0001 4 \u0001\u0001 | \u0001\u0001 | \u0001 \u0001 but with an opening to other modulations. The subject is the Vedantic ideal of the living liberated man — j ̄ ıvanmukta — though perhaps I have given a pull towards my own ideal which the strict Vedantin would consider illegitimate.

But those laws are quite alien to the rhythm and sound-structure of the English tongue; the attempt to observe them has always ended in deserved and inevitable failure. Another system has been fol- lowed here which is in agreement with the native rhythm of English speech. There what determines the metrical length or brevity of syllables is weight, the weight of the voice emphasis or the dwelling of the voice upon the sound. Where there is that emphasis or that dwelling of the voice, the syllable may be considered metrically long; where both are absent there will be, normally, a recognisable shortness which can only be cured by some aid of consonant weight or other lengthening circum- stance. All stressed syllables are metrically long in English and cannot be otherwise, however short the vowel may be, for they dominate the verse movement; this is a fact which is ignored in the traditional account of English quantity and which many ex- perimenters in quantitative verse have chosen to disregard with disastrous consequences, — all their genius or skill in metrical technique could not save them from failure. On the other hand, a long-vowel syllable can be regarded as metrically long even if there is no stress upon it. In the quantitative system used in these poems this possibility is converted into a law: metrical length is obligatory for all such natural syllabic longs, while a short-vowel syllable unstressed is normally short for metrical purposes unless it is very heavily weighted with consonants. But the mere occurrence of two or more consonants after a short vowel does not by itself make the syllable long as it necessarily does in Greek, Latin or Sanskrit. The system may then be reduced to the following rules: 1. All stressed syllables are regarded as metrically long, as also all syllables supported on a long vowel. 2. All short-vowel syllables not stressed are regarded as"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"566 Pondicherry, c. 1927 – 1947 short, unless they are heavily weighted with consonants. But on this last point no fixed rule can be given; in each case the ear must be the judge. 3. There are a great number of sounds in English which can be regarded according to circumstances either as longs or as shorts. Here too the ear must decide in each case. 4. English quantity metres cannot be as rigid as the me- tres of ancient tongues. The rhythm of the language demands a certain variability, free or sparing, without which monotony sets in; accordingly in all English metres modulation is admitted as possible. Even the most regular rhythms do not altogether shut out the substitution of other feet than those fixed in the normal basic arrangement of the line; they admit at least so much as is needed to give the necessary pliancy or variety to the movement. There is sometimes a very free use of such vari- ations; but they ought not to be allowed to break the basic movement or overburden or overlay it. The same rule must apply in quantitative metres; especially in long poems modulations are indispensable. This system is not only not at discord with the sound- structure of the language, it accords closely with its natural rhythm; it only regulates and intensifies into metrical pitch and tone the cadence that is already there even in prose, even in daily speech. If we take passages from English literature which were written as prose but with some intensity of rhythm, its movement can be at once detected. E.g.

This last sentence can be read indeed as a very perfect hexameter. The first of these passages could be easily presented as four lines of free quantitative verse, each independent in its arrangement of feet, but all swaying in a single rhythm. Shakespeare’s is most wonderfully balanced in a series of differing four-syllabled, with occasional shorter, feet, as if of deliberate purpose, though it is no intention of the mind but the ear of the poet that has con- structed this fine design of rhythmic prose. A free quantitative verse in this kind would be perfectly possible. A more regular quantitative metre can be of two kinds. There could be lines all with the same metrical arrangement following each other without break or else alternating lines with a different arrangement for each, forming a stanza, — as in the practice of accentual metres. But there could also be an arrangement in strophe and antistrophe as in the Greek chorus. In “Thought the Paraclete” the first rule is followed; all the lines are on the same model. The metre of this poem has a certain rhythmic similarity to the Latin hendecasyllable which runs | \u0001\u0001 | \u0001 | \u0001 | \u0001 ,e.g. So _ le _ s | o _ cci ̆ de ̆ r(e) | e _ tre ̆ | di _ re ̆ | po _ ssu _ nt.

Classical metres cannot always with success be taken over just as they are into the English rhythm; often some modifications are needed to make them more malleable. In “Moon of Two Hemispheres” the strophe antistrophe system has been used: the lines of the stanza differ from each other in the nature and order of the feet, no identity or approach to identity is imposed; but each line of the antistrophe follows scrupulously the arrangement of the corresponding line of the strophe. An occasional modulation at most is allowed, e.g. the substitution of a trochee for a spondee. The whole poem, how- ever, in spite of its metrical variations, follows a single general rhythmic movement. “Rose of God”, like a previous poem “In Horis Aeternum”, is written in pure stress metre. As stress and high accentual pitch usually coincide, it is possible to scan accentual metre on the stress principle and stress metre also can be so written that it can be scanned as accentual verse; but pure stress metre depends entirely on stress ictus. In ordinary poetry stress and natural syllabic quantity enter in as elements of the rhythm, but are not, qua stress and quantity, essential elements of the basic metre: in pure stress metre there is a reversal of these values; quantity and accentual inflexion are subordinate and help to build the rhythm, but stress alone determines the metrical basis. In “Rose of God” each line is composed of six stresses, and the whole poem is built of five stanzas, each containing four such lines; the arrangement of feet varies freely to suit the movement of thought and feeling in each line. Thus, * Suns may set and come again; For us, when once our brief light has set, There is one perpetual night to be slept.

One might add that he was a poet before he entered politics and a poet after he ceased to write about politics or philosophy. His first pub lished work, written apparently towards the end of 1882, was a short poem. The last writing work he did, towards the end of 1950, was revision of the epic poem Savitri .The results of these sixty-eight years of poetic output are collected in the present volume, with the exception of Savitri , dramatic poetry, poetic translations, and poems written in Bengali and Sanskrit. These appear, respectively, in Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol , Collected Plays and Stories , Translations ,and Writings in Bengali and Sanskrit , volumes 33 – 34, 3 – 4, 5, and 9 of T HE C OMPLETE W ORKS OF S RI A UROBINDO . The poems in the present volume have been arranged in seven chronological parts. The dates of the parts overlap because some of the books that define each period contain poems from a wide range of dates. Within each part, poems from books published by the author are followed by complete and incomplete poems published posthumously. Poems that appeared in books published by Sri Aurobindo during his lifetime are arranged as they were in those books. Otherwise, poems within each section of each part are arranged chronologically. Poems written in Greek and in French appear in an appendix at the end of the volume. P ART O NE :E NGLAND AND B ARODA , 1883 – 1898 Sri Aurobindo went to England as a child of seven in 1879. He lived in Manchester until 1884, when he went to London to study at St. Paul’s School. From there he went to Cambridge in 1890. Three years later he returned to India, and until 1906 lived and worked in the princely state of Baroda. He began writing poetry in Manchester, and continued"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"692 Collected Poems in London, Cambridge and Baroda. His first collection, published in Baroda in 1898, contained poems wri tten in England and Baroda. This collection is reproduced in the present part, along with other poems written during these years. Poem Published in 1883 Light . Published 1883. Asked in 1939, “When did you begin to write poetry?”, Sri Aurobindo replied: “When my two brothers and I were staying at Manchester. I wrote for the Fox family magazine. It was an awful imitation of somebody I don’t remember.” The only English journal having a name resembling “the Fox family magazine” is Fox’s Weekly , which first appeared on 11 January 1883 and was suspended the following November. Published from Leeds, it catered to the middle and working classes of that industrial town. A total of nine poems appeared in Fox’s Weekly during its brief existence. All but one of them are coarse adult satires. The exception is “Light”, published in the issue of 11 January 1883. Like all other poems in Fox’s Weekly , “Light” is unsigned, but there can be no doubt that it was the poem to which Sri Aurobindo referred when he said that his first verses were published in “the Fox family magazine”. The poem’s stanza is an imitation of the one used by P. B. Shelley in the well-known lyric “The Cloud”. Sri Aurobindo remarked in 1926 that as a child in Manchester, he went through the works of Shelley again and again. He also wrote that he read the Bible “assiduously” while living in the house of his guardian, William H. Drewett, a Congregationalist clergyman. Songs to Myrtilla This, Sri Aurobindo’s first collection of poems, was printed in 1898 for private circulation by the Lakshmi Vilas Printing Press, Baroda, under the title Songs to Myrtilla and Other Poems . No copy of the first edition survives. The second edition, which was probably a reimpression of the first, is undated. The date of publication must therefore be inferred from other evidence. The book’s handwritten manuscript, as well as the second edition, contains the poem “Lines on Ireland”, dated 1896. The second edition contains a translation from Chandidasa that almost"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 693 certainly was done using an edition of Chandidasa’s works published in 1897. On 17 October 1898, Sri Aurobindo’s brother Manmohan wrote in a letter to Rabindranath Tagore: “My brother . . . has just published a volume of poems at Baroda.” This book evidently is Songs to Myrtilla . In another letter Manmohan tells Tagore: “Aurobinda is anxious to know what you think of his book of verses.” This second letter is dated 24 October 1894, but the year clearly is wrong. Manmo- han had not even returned to India from England by that date. When the two letters are read together and when other documentary evidence is evaluated, it becomes clear that the second letter also was written in 1898, and that this was the year of publication of the first edition of Songs to Myrtilla . 1 The “second edition” apparently appeared a year or two later. A new edition of the book, entitled simply Songs to Myrtilla ,was published by the Arya Publishing House, Calcutta, in April 1923. When a biographer suggested during the 1940s that all the poems in Songs to Myrtilla were written in Baroda, except for five that were written in England, Sri Aurobindo corrected him as follows: “It is the other way round; all the poems in the book were written in England except five later ones which were written after his return to India.” The following poems certainly were written in Baroda after his return to India in 1893: “Lines on Ireland” (dated 1896), “Saraswati with the Lotus” and “Bankim Chandra C hatterji” (both written after the death of Bankim in 1894), and “To the Cuckoo” (originally subtitled “A Spring morning in India”). “Madhusudan Dutt” was probably also written in Baroda, as were the two adaptations of poems by Chandidasa. This makes seven poems. The number five, proposed by the biographer and not by Sri Aurobindo, was probably not meant by Sri Aurobindo to be taken as an exact figure. The handwritten manuscript of Songs to Myrtilla contains one poem, “The Just Man”, that was not printed in any edition of the book. (It is reproduced here in the third section of Part One.) The manuscript and the second edition contain a dedication and a Latin epigraph, which Sri Aurobindo later deleted.

This made it impossible for him to revise or publish these poems after his release from jail in 1909. In the manuscript, the first four sonnets are grouped together under the heading: “Four Sonnets”.

As recorded in the subtitle, this poem was written for Sri Aurobindo’s cousin Basanti Mitra, who was born on 9 Jyestha 1292 (22 May 1886).

P ART T HREE :B ARODA AND B ENGAL , CIRCA 1900 – 1909 Poems from Ahana and Other Poems Ahana and Other Poems was published in 1915. It consists of the long poem Ahana , written in Pondicherry, and twenty-four shorter poems, most of which were written in Baroda. Sometime after 1915, Sri Aurobindo wrote in his copy of the book, “Written mostly be- tween 1895 and 1908, first published at Pondicherry in 1915.” This inscription shows a degree of uncertainty: “1895” was written over “1900”, while “1908” was written over “1907”. Neither of the dates, written more than a decade after the poems, need be considered exact. Surviving manuscript drafts of these poems do not appear to be earlier than 1900. Near-final drafts of many of them are found in a typed manuscript that may be dated to 1904 – 6. When Sri Aurobindo looked over these poems in 1942 while his Collected Poems and Plays was being arranged, he commented: “I find that most of the poems are quite early in Baroda, others later on and others in the second period [ of poems in the book, i.e. 1906 – 9 ]. It would be a pity to break up these poems, as they form a natural group by themselves.” In the present volume, these twenty-four poems are published in a single group, while “Ahana” is published along with other works written in Pondicherry.

This and another draft of the poem were seized by the British police when Sri Aurobindo was arrested in 1908. Several years later, in Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo began what appears to be a new or revised version of this poem, but wrote only three lines: Where in a lapse of the hills leaps lightly down with laughter White with her rustle of raiment upon the spray strewn boulders, Cold in her virgin childhood the river resonant Ganges.

Between Novem- ber 1906 and May 1908 he was the editor of the daily newspaper Bande Mataram , and had little occasion to write poetry. In May 1908 he was arrested and imprisoned in Alipore Jail.

Satirical Poem Published in 1907 Reflections of Srinath Paul, Rai Bahadoor, on the Present Discontents . This poem was published on 5 April 1907 in the daily Bande Mataram . This political newspaper, edited by Sri Aurobindo and others, carried a number of satirical poems, most of which were the work of Sri Aurobindo’s colleague Shyam Sundar Chakravarti. This piece is the exception. Sri Aurobindo remembered writing it in 1942 when his po- ems were being collected for publication in Collected Poems and Plays . (It was not published in that collection because the file of the daily Bande Mataram was not then available.) Later the poem was indepen- dently ascribed to Sri Aurobindo by Hemendra Prasad Ghose, another Bande Mataram editor and writer, who was in a way responsible for its composition. In his report on the session of the Bengal Provincial Conference held in Behrampore in 1907, Hemendra Prasad wrote that the chairman of the Reception Committee, a loyalist named Srinath Paul (who bore the honourary British title Rai Bahadoor), finished his address “perspiring and short of breath” ( Bande Mataram , 2 April 1907). This phrase moved Sri Aurobindo to write this amusing piece of political satire. It was published under the heading “By the Way”, which was the headline he used for his occasional column in Bande Mataram . The same words were used in place of a signature at the end. Short Poems Published in 1909 and 1910 The Mother of Dreams . 1908 – 9. Published in the Modern Review in July 1909, two months after Sri Aurobindo’s release from the Alipore Jail. The following note was appended to the text: “This poem was composed by Mr. Aurobindo Ghose in t he Alipore Jail, of course with- out the aid of any writing materials. He committed it to memory and wrote it down after his release. There are several other poems of his, composed in jail.”"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 703 An Image . Circa 1909. Published in the Karmayogin on 20 November 1909. (This was the third poem by Sri Aurobindo that he published in the Karmayogin . The first two, “Invitation” and “Who”, were included in Ahana and Other Poems in 1915, and so are included in Part Three of the present volume.) “An Image”, Sri Aurobindo’s first published lines in quantitative hexameters, may be related in some way to Ilion , his epic poem in that metre, which he began to write in Alipore Jail (see below, Part Five). The Birth of Sin . Circa 1909. Published in the Karmayogin on 11 December 1909. A fragmentary draft of a related piece is found in one of Sri Aurobindo’s notebooks in handwriting of the 1909 – 10 period. That piece, which is more in the nature of a play than a poem, is published in Collected Plays and Stories , volume 4 of T HE C OMPLETE W ORKS OF S RI A UROBINDO . Epiphany . Circa 1909. Published in the Karmayogin on 18 December 1909. Around 1913, Sri Aurobindo copied the Karmayogin text into a notebook, making a few deliberate changes as he did so. Later he revised the opening and close of this version. Three decades later, when Collected Poems and Plays was being compiled, the editors, not knowing about the 1913 version, sent the Karmayogin text to Sri Aurobindo, who made a few revisions to it. This version was used in Collected Poems and Plays (1942) and reproduced in Collected Poems in 1972. The editors of the present volume have selected the more extensively revised version of 1913 for the text reproduced here. The 1942 version is reproduced in the Reference Volume. To R . 1909. Published in the Modern Review in April 1910 under the title “To R — ” and dated 19 July 1909. “R” stands for Ratna, which was the pet name of Sri Aurobindo’s cousin Kumudini Mitra, who was born on 3 Sraban 1289 (18 July 1882). In the Modern Review ,the poem was signed “Auro Dada” (big brother Auro). Transiit, Non Periit . 1909 or earlier. This sonnet to Rajnarain Bose, Sri Aurobindo’s maternal grandfather and a well-known writer and speaker, was first published at the beginning of Atmacharit ,Rajnarain’s memoirs, in 1909. As mentioned in the note beneath the title, Rajnarain died in September 1899.

No title in the manuscript. Circa 1909. The single manuscript text of this poem is found in a notebook that Sri Aurobindo used for the dramatic version of “The Birth of Sin” (see the previous section) and for the dialogue that follows. All these poems are in the handwriting of the 1909 – 10 period. A Dialogue . No title in the manuscript. Circa 1909. Written in the same notebook and in the same handwriting as “Perfect thy motion” and the dramatic version of “The Birth of Sin”. Unlike that piece, it is not structured as a play, and so has been printed here as a dramatic poem. Narrative Poems Published in 1910 Baji Prabhou . Circa 1904 – 9. Sri Aurobindo wrote that this work was “conceived and written in Bengal during the period of political activity”. This leaves the precise date of its composition unclear. Sri Aurobindo went to Bengal and openly joined the national movement in February 1906, but he had been active behind the scenes for some years before that. A partial draft of Baji Prabhou is found in a note- book he used from around 1902 to around 1910. The handwriting of this draft is that of the later years in Baroda (1904 – 6), and it is probable the poem was written during that period. (Sri Aurobindo spent a good deal of time in Bengal during these years.) Baji Prabhou was published for the first time in three issues of the Karmayogin :19 February, 26 February and 5 March 1910. At some point he revised the first instalment of the Karmayogin text, but did not make use of this revision subsequently. In 1922 he published the Karmayogin text (with new, very light, revision) at the Modern Press, Pondicherry. This text became the basis of a further revised version published in Collected Poems and Plays in 1942. This 1942 version is the basis of the present text.

In the present edition these readings have been ignored, but the 1922 and 1942 revisions, both approved by Sri Aurobindo, have been included.) Chitrangada . 1909 – 10. This incomplete poem is related in theme and form to “Uloupie” (see above, Part Two), which Sri Aurobindo wrote around 1901 – 2. The manuscript of “Uloupie” was confiscated by the police in 1908 and never returned. There were, however, two draft passages of the poem in a notebook that Sri Aurobindo had with him in 1909 – 10, and he apparently drew on these to write Chitrangada . Many of the lines in the final version are identical or almost identical to those in the draft passages. Sometime before he left Bengal in February 1910, he gave the manuscript of Chitrangada to the Karmayogin staff for publication. The poem appeared in that newspaper in the issues of 26 March and 2 April 1910. “To be continued” was printed at the end of the second instalment, but the issue in which it appeared was the last to come out. The manuscript of the rest of the poem has been lost. Around 1930, one of Sri Aurobindo’s disciples typed the incomplete poem out from the Karmayogin and sent it to Sri Aurobindo, who expressed some dissatisfaction with it. In 1937 he indicated that the poem required some revision before it could be published, but that it was “not the moment” for that. More than a decade later, he revised Chitrangada for publication in the 1949 number of the Sri Aurobindo Circle annual. The following note was printed along with the Circle text: “Sri Aurobindo had completed this poem but the original has been lost, only this fragment remains. It has been revised for publication.” The revision considerably enlarged the passage containing the speech of Chitrangada’s “dying sire”. The new lines appear to be the last poetical lines Sri Aurobindo composed, with the exception of the final revisions and additions to Savitri . Poems Written in 1910 and Published in 1920–1921 These three poems have an unusual history. They form part of a manu- script containing material appare ntly intended for three issues of the Karmayogin .

(See the Note on the Texts to Early Cultural Writings , volume 1 of T HE C OMPLETE W ORKS OF S RI A UROBINDO ,for more information on this “Chandernagore Manuscript”.) In the mid- dle of February 1910, Sri Aurobindo left Calcutta for Chandernagore, where he remained for six weeks before departing for Pondicherry. It would appear that he left the manuscript containing these poems behind in Chandernagore, that someone there made copies of the po- ems and other contents of the manuscript, and that at some point the original manuscript was sent to him in Pondicherry. (See Arun Chandra Dutt, ed., Light to Superlight [Calcutta: Prabartak Publishers, 1972], p. 207.) In 1920 – 21 defective texts of the poems (as well as some of the other contents of the manuscript) were published in the Standard Bearer , a journal brought out from Cha ndernagore. Sometime after their publication, Sri Aurobindo revised the Standard Bearer texts. In 1942, the Standard Bearer versions were given to Sri Aurobindo for further revision before inclusion in Collected Poems and Plays . Evidently he and the editors of the volume had by this time forgotten about the existence of the original manuscripts. These manuscripts, however, are superior to the defective Standard Bearer texts and also to the 1942 version, which is based on those texts. The editors of the present volume have therefore based the texts printed here on the original manuscripts, incorporating the deliberate changes made by Sri Aurobindo in 1942. The texts printed in Collected Poems and Plays are included in the Reference Volume. The Rakshasas . 1910.

P ART F IVE :P ONDICHERRY , CIRCA 1910 – 1920 Sri Aurobindo came to Pondicherry in 1910 and remained there until his passing in 1950. During this period he published four collections of short poems as well as Collected Poems and Plays (1942). He also published a number of short poems in journals, and wrote scores of poems, long and short, that were not br ought out until after his passing. Two Poems in Quantitative Hexameters Ilion . Sri Aurobindo began work on this epic in quantitative hexam- eters in 1908 or 1909. The earliest surviving manuscript lines of the poem — then entitled “The Fall of Troy: An Epic” — were dated by the author as follows: “Commenced in jail, 1909, resumed and completed in Pondicherry, April and May 1910.” Between then and 1914, he worked steadily on this “completed” poem, transforming it from a brief narrative into an epic made up of several books. During the first stage of this enlargement, between April 1910 and March 1913, he produced almost a dozen drafts of the first book and a smaller number of drafts of the second. In Marc h 1913, a sudden fluency permitted him to complete and revise a version of the epic extending up to the end of what is now Book VIII. He wrote the fragmentary ninth book (untitled and not actually headed “Book IX” in the manuscript) in 1914. Probably before then, he copied out the first eight books into notebooks that bear the title Ilion . Subsequently he revised and recopied the completed books, or passages from them, several times. This work continued until around 1917. It would appear that two"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"708 Collected Poems factors — the writing-load of the monthly journal Arya (1914 – 21) and the attention demanded by his other epic, Savitri — caused him to stop work on Ilion before completing what presumably was intended to be a twelve-book epic. During the twenties and thirties, Sri Aurobindo returned to Ilion from time to time. As late as 1935, he complained jocularly that if he could get an hour’s freedom from his correspondence every day, “in another three years Savitri and Ilion and I don’t know how much more would all be rewritten, finished, resplendently complete”. He in fact never found time to complete Ilion , but in 1942 he revised the opening of the first book to serve as an illustration of the quantitative hexameter in “On Quantitative Me tre”, an essay that was published in Collected Poems and Plays in 1942 and also in a separate booklet issued the same year. This revised passage of 371 lines was the only portion of Ilion to appear in print during his lifetime. The full text was transcribed from his manuscripts and published in 1957. A new edition, corrected against the manuscripts and with the addition of the opening of the fragmentary ninth book, was brought out in 1989. The present text has been rechecked against the manuscripts. Ahana . This poem in rhymed hexametric couplets, grew out of “The Descent of Ahana” (see below), which took its final form around 1912 – 13. “The Descent of Ahana” is divided into two parts. The first part consists of a long dialogue between Ahana and “Voices”; the second consists of a speech by Ahana, a speech by “A Voice”, and a final speech by Ahana. In the final draft of “The Descent”, the last two speeches of the second part comprise 160 lines. In or before 1915, Sri Aurobindo revised and enlarged these 160 lines into the 171-line poem that was published in Ahana and Other Poems . In this version, Sri Aurobindo added a head-note setting the scene of the poem and a footnote glossing the term “Ras”. Sometime after 1915, he revised the 1915 text, but apparently forgot about this revision, which has never been published. In or before 1942, he again revised the 1915 text for publication in Collected Poems and Plays . This 1942 revision brought the poem to its present length of 518 lines."},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 709 Poems from Manuscripts, circa 1912–1913 The Descent of Ahana . Circa 1912 – 13. The earliest known draft of this poem is found among the papers that the police seized from Sri Aurobindo’s room when he was arrested in May 1908. A complete fair copy is found in a manuscript notebook that may be dated circa 1912 – 13. The second part of the fair copy was subsequently revised and published under the title “Ahana” in Ahana and Other Poems (1915). See the note to “Ahana” in the previous section. The Meditations of Mandavya . 1913. Sri Aurobindo wrote the date “April 12, 1913” at the end of a draft of the first part of this poem. The incident of the scorpion-sting happened before 14 February 1911, when Sri Aurobindo mentioned it in Record of Yoga as something that had happened in the past. In the mid 1930s, when the book entitled Poems Past and Present was being prepared, a copy of “The Meditations of Mandavya” was typed for Sri Aurobindo, who revised it lightly. He chose however not to include the poem in that collection. The revisions done at that time are incorporated in the text for the first time in the present edition. Incomplete Poems from Manuscripts, circa 1912–1920 Thou who controllest . No title in the manuscript. Circa 1912. Sri Aurobindo wrote these lines in dactylic hexameter inside the back cover of a notebook that he used sometime before November 1912.

P ART S IX :B ARODA AND P ONDICHERRY , CIRCA 1902 – 1936 Poems Past and Present These eight poems were published as a booklet by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1946. (Four of them — “Musa Spiritus”, “Bride of the Fire”, “The Blue Bird” and “A God’s Labour” — had appeared in journals connected with the Ashram earlier the same year.) All the poems were written at least a decade, one of them four and a half decades, before 1946. The first draft of “Hell and Heaven” dates back to around 1902, early drafts of “Kamadeva” and “Life” to around 1913. A notebook containing these three early poems was uncovered by Sri Aurobindo’s secretary, Nolini Kanta Gupta, in April 1932. He typed out copies and sent them to Sri Aurobindo with this note: “I have copied these poems out of a notebook that was being hopelessly eaten away by insects. I do not know how far I have been able to recover the text.” Sri Aurobindo revised these poems around that time, adding a fourth, “One Day”, while he worked. Several years later these four poems were published along with four that had been written in 1935 and 1936 under the title Poems Past and Present . The eight poems are reproduced here in the order in which they are printed in that book. Musa Spiritus . 1935.

The earliest extant draft of this poem is found in the typed manuscript that contains drafts of “To the Ganges”, “To the Boers”, etc. (see above, Part Three). Around 1912 Sri Aurobindo copied the poem out by hand in a notebook. Twenty years later, his secretary Nolini Kanta Gupta typed this and the next two poems out from this notebook and presented them to Sri Aurobindo for revision. Fourteen years after that they were included in Poems Past and Present . There are one handwritten and two typed manuscripts. Kamadeva . Circa 1913.

One of the volumes of poems, Poems Past and Present , comprises Part Six of the present volume. The other volumes are included in this part, which also contains complete and incomplete poems from his manuscripts of the same period. Six Poems These poems were written in 1932, 1933 and 1934. In 1934 a book was planned that would include the six poems along with translations of them into Bengali by disciples of Sri Aurobindo. This book was published by Rameshwar & Co., Chandernagore, before the end of the year. Shown a proposed publicity blurb for the book, Sri Aurobindo wrote: “One can’t blow one’s own trumpet in this monstrous way, nor do I want it to be indicated that I am publishing this book. It is Nolini’s publication, not mine. Why can’t a decent notice be given instead of these terrible blurbs?” He also wrote his own descriptive paragraph stating that the six poems were in “novel English metres” and that the book included “notes on the metres of the poems and their significance drawn from the letters of Sri Aurobindo”. The texts as well as the notes were reprinted in Collected Poems and Plays (1942). The Bird of Fire . 17 October 1933. No handwritten manuscripts of this poem survive. There are three typed manuscripts, two of which are dated 17 October 1933. In a letter written shortly afterwards, Sri Aurobindo said that “Bird of Fire” was “written on two consecutive days — and afterwards revised”. He also wrote that this poem and “Trance” (see below) were completed the same day. 2 Trance . 16 October 1933. There are two handwritten manuscripts and one typed manuscript, which is dated “16.10.33”. In the same letter in which Sri Aurobindo wrote about the composition of “The Bird of Fire” (see above), he noted that “Trance” was written “at one sitting 2 Sri Aurobindo, Letters on Poetry and Art , volume 27 of T HE C OMPLETE W ORKS OF S RI A UROBINDO , p. 244."},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 713 — it took only a few minutes”. In Six Poems “Trance” was placed after “The Bird of Fire”. Shiva . 6 November 1933. There are two handwritten manuscripts and one typed manuscript, which is dated “6.11.33”. The Life Heavens . 15 November 1933. There are four handwritten and three typed manuscripts. The typed manuscripts are dated “15.11.33”. Jivanmukta . 13 April 1934. There are four handwritten and two typed manuscripts. The typed manuscripts are dated “13.4.34”. The poem was published in the Calcutta Review in June 1934. In Horis Aeternum . 19 April 1932. Sri Aurobindo began this poem while corresponding with Arjava (J. A. Chadwick, a British disciple) about English prosody. He wrote the first stanza in a letter to Arjava and the full poem in a subsequent letter ( Letters on Poetry and Art , pp. 231 – 34). There are two handwritten and two typed manuscripts. One of the typed manuscripts is dated “19.4.32”. Notes . These notes were compiled from Sri Aurobindo’s letters and revised by him for publication while Six Poems was under production. Poems These six poems were written during the early 1930s and published as a booklet by the Government Central Press, Hyderabad, in 1941. The next year they were reprinted in Collected Poems and Plays under the heading “Transformation and Other Poems”. Sometime in the 1940s a small edition of the book was published by the India Library Society, New York. Transformation . Circa 1933. This sonnet was published in the Calcutta Review in October 1934. Two months earlier, Sri Aurobindo asked his secretary to type copies of this poem and three others (“The Other Earths”, “The World Game” and “Symbol Moon”) from the notebook in which they and others had been written. When “Transformation” and “The Other Earths” were published in 1934, Sri Aurobindo in- formed a disciple that they were “some years old already” ( Letters on Poetry and Art , p. 211), but it is unlikely that they were more than a year old at that time. The first draft of “Transformation” occurs in a notebook just after the first draft of “Trance”, which is dated 16"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"714 Collected Poems October 1933; it is probable that “Transformation” was written the same year. There are two handwritten and two typed manuscripts of this poem. In a note written after “Transformation” and the next two sonnets were typed for publication, Sri Aurobindo said that he wanted the sestets of Miltonic sonnets to be set as they have been set in the present book, irrespective of rhyme scheme. Nirvana . August 1934. This sonnet was written while the texts of “Transformation” and “The Other Earths” were being prepared for publication in the Calcutta Review . It was published along with them in that journal in October 1934. There are two handwritten manuscripts and one typed manuscript of this poem. The Other Earths . Circa 1933. This sonnet was published in the Cal- cutta Review in October 1934. Its first draft occurs just after the first draft of “Transformation”, which is dated 16 October 1933; thus it belongs, in all probability, to the year 1933. See the note to “Trans- formation” for more details. Writing to a disciple who was trying to translate it into Bengali, Sri Aurobindo wrote that the line “Fire impor- tunities of scarlet bloom” meant “an abundance of scarlet blossoms importuning (constantly insisting, besieging) with the fire of their vivid hues”. There are two handwritten and two typed manuscripts of this poem. Thought the Paraclete . 31 December 1934 (this is the date on a typed manuscript; the handwritten manuscripts were probably written in June 1934). This poem originated as a metrical experiment, in which Sri Aurobindo tried to match a Bengali metrical model submitted to him by his disciple Dilip Kumar Roy. 3 There are at least three hand- written and two typed manuscripts of this poem. A printed text was produced sometime before 1941, but apparently was never published. Moon of Two Hemispheres . July 1934. Like “Thought the Paraclete”, this poem originated in an attempt to duplicate a Bengali metre pro- posed by Dilip Kumar Roy. Replying to Dilip, Sri Aurobindo began: “After two days of wrestling I have to admit that I am beaten by your last metre. I have written something, but it is a fake.” He then wrote out the first stanza of the poem, pointing out where he had 3 Dilip Kumar Roy, Sri Aurobindo Came to Me (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 1952), p. 237."},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 715 failed to meet Dilip’s specifications. He closed by saying: “I have some idea of adding a second stanza”, though “it may never take birth at all” ( Letters on Poetry and Art , pp. 235 – 36). He did write a second stanza later. The poem was published in the “Sri Aurobindo Number” (volume 2, number 5) of the Calcutta fortnightly journal Onward in August 1934. There are four handwritten and two typed manuscripts of this poem. Rose of God . 29 – 30 December 1934. There is one handwritten and one typed manuscript of this poem. The typed manuscript is dated 31 December 1934; however Sri Aurobindo wrote in a letter to a disciple that “Rose of God” was ready “on the 30th having been written on that and the previous day”. On 31 December, he wrote to his secretary that the just-typed “Rose of God” could be “circulated first as a sort of New Year invocation”. On 2 March 1935, his secretary wrote to him saying that the editor of a quarterly journal had asked for a poem to be published, and asking whether “Rose of God” could be sent. Sri Aurobindo replied: “I feel squeamish about publishing the ‘Rose of God’ in a magazine or newspaper. It seems to me the wrong place altogether.” Note . This note did not form part of Poems (1941); it was first published in 1942 in Collected Poems and Plays . Poems Published in On Quantitative Metre With two exceptions, these poems were written in 1942 for publication in Collected Poems and Plays . Sri Aurobindo later commented that he wrote them “very rapidly — in the course of a week, I think”. In regard to “Flame-Wind” and “Trance of Waiting”, this would refer not to the composition but the revision, since the first drafts of these pieces were written during the mid 1930s. The fourteen poems, along with the first 371 lines of Ilion , first appeared as an appendix to On Quantitative Metre . This text was published as part of Collected Poems and Plays , and also as a separate book, in 1942. Each of the poems was followed by a footnote written by the author giving details of the metre used.

Only three of them were published in a book during his lifetime (see above under Poems ). The other seventy-two are reproduced in the present section. See the note to “Transformation” for typographical conventions. Sri Aurobindo wrote in 1934 that he intended his sonnets to “be published in a separate book of sonnets”. This was done in the book Sonnets , first published in 1980. Three Sonnets One of these sonnets was written around 1934, the other two in 1939. Sri Aurobindo selected them from among his completed sonnets for publication in the Sri Aurobindo Circle , Bombay, in 1948. They were published under the heading “Three Sonnets”. Man the Enigma . 17 September 1939. Three handwritten and two typed manuscripts precede the Circle publication in 1948. The Infinitesimal Infinite . Circa 1934.

Four handwritten and two typed manuscripts precede the Circle publication in 1948. Sonnets from Manuscripts, circa 1934–1947 On 31 December 1934, Nolini Kanta Gupta wrote in a note to Sri Aurobindo: “Sometime ago I typed Seven Sonnets — Are they not in their final form?” Sri Aurobindo replied: “No. I have had no time to see them — and I am still a little doubtful about their quality.” The seven sonnets were (in the order of Nolini’s typed copies): “Contrasts”, “Man the Thinking Animal”, “Evolution [1]”, “Evolution [2]”, “The Call of the Impossible”, “Man the Mediator”, and “The Infinitesimal Infinite”. Sri Aurobindo later revised most of the seven, along with an eighth, “The Silver Call”, which is related to “The Infinitesimal Infi- nite”. After further revision he published “The Infinitesimal Infinite” as part of “Three Sonnets” in 1948 (see above)."},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"718 Collected Poems Man the Thinking Animal .

Written on or before 25 April 1934 (when Sri Auro- bindo quoted five lines in a letter to Dilip Kumar Roy); revised 1944. Five handwritten manuscripts and one typed manuscript; the first handwritten manuscript was written shortly after those of the two preceding sonnets. The original poem went through several versions, eventually becoming two, “The Silver Call” and “The Call of the Impossible”. The final version of “The Silver Call” is dated “193 – (?) / 23.3.44”. Evolution [1] . Circa 1934, revised 1944. Five handwritten manuscripts and one typed manuscript, that is dated “193 – (?) / 22.3.44”. This poem and the one above were often worked on together, as were the two that follow. The Call of the Impossible . 1934; revised subsequently. Four hand- written manuscripts and one typed manuscript. This poem began as a variant of “The Silver Call”: the first lines of the two poems were once identical — “There is a godhead in unrealised things” — and the first rhyming words remain the same even in the final versions. Evolution [2] . Circa 1934. Two handwritten manuscripts and one typed manuscript. The handwritten drafts were written around the same time as early drafts of “The Call of the Impossible”; the final typed versions of the two poems are also contemporaneous. The present sonnet has the same title as the one which forms a pair with “A Silver Call” (see “Evolution [1]” above). There is no textual relation between it and its namesake, but there is some between it and “The Silver Call”: its closing couplet was first used as the close of “The Silver Call” and its second and fourth lines are similar to the tenth and twelfth lines of “The Silver Call”.

Poems Written as Metrical Experiments Sri Aurobindo wrote most of these pieces in a somewhat playful effort to match metrical models submitted to him by his disciple Dilip Kumar Roy. As Dilip writes in Sri Aurobindo Came to Me , p. 233: “At the time I was transposing some English modulations into our Bengali verse which he [Sri Aurobindo] greatly appreciated in so much that, to encourage me, he composed short poems now and then as English counterparts to my Bengali bases.” One such experiment resulted in the poem “Thought the Paraclete”, which Sri Aurobindo later revised and included in the book Poems (see above). All but one of the others exist in one or more drafts in Sri Aurobindo’s notebooks of the period. The exception, “In some faint dawn”, is known only by the text published by Dilip in Sri Aurobindo Came to Me . The nine poems published in that book are reproduced here in the same order. Another poem written in response to a letter from Dilip is placed before the rest, while two others, also metrical experiments, have been placed at the end of Dilip’s set.

Nonsense and “Surrealist” Verse Sri Aurobindo wrote the first of these poems in isolation during the late 1920s or early 1930s. He wrote the other items as an amusement after some of his disciples tried to interest him in the subject of surrealistic poetry. See also the more serious sonnet “A Dream of Surreal Science” in the section ”Lyrical Poems”. A Ballad of Doom . Late 1920s or early 1930s. There is one hand- written manuscript of this piece, the writing of which has completely faded away. A transcription made years ago was published in the"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"726 Collected Poems journal Mother India in April 1974. The editors have verified and corrected this transcription using images made by means of infrared photography, scanning and imaging software. Several words in the text remain somewhat doubtful. Surrealist . Circa 1936. One handwritten manuscript, written before 28 December 1936, when Sri Aurobindo mentioned it in a letter to a disciple. Surrealist Poems . Circa 1943. (The Moro River, mentioned in the sec- ond poem, is a river in Italy that was the site of a battle between Canadian and German forces in December 1943; the notebook in which the poem is written was in use during the early 1940s.) One handwritten manuscript, consisting of two pages of a “Bloc-Memo” pad. Sri Aurobindo first wrote, in th e upper left hand corner, “Parody”, then, as title, “Surrealist Poems”. Beneath the first poem, he wrote a tongue-in-cheek explanation within his own square brackets, then, after “2”, the title and text of the second poem. Incomplete Poems from Manuscripts, circa 1927–1947 Thou art myself . No title in the manuscript. 1927 – 29. One handwrit- ten manuscript, jotted down in a notebook used otherwise for diary entries, essays, etc. In the manuscript, the word “Or”, presumably the beginning of an unwritten second stanza, comes after the fourth line. Vain, they have said . No title in the manuscript. Circa 1927. Although written, like “Ahana”, in rhymed dactylic hexameter couplets, these lines do not seem to have been intended for inclusion in that poem. (The phrase “to infinity calling” does occur both here and in “The Descent of Ahana”, but in different contexts.) One handwritten manuscript. Pururavus . Circa 1933. Several handwritten drafts in a single note- book. It would appear from the manuscript that Sri Aurobindo began this passage as a proposed revision to the opening of the narrative poem “Urvasie”. The passage developed on different lines, however, and Sri Aurobindo soon stopped work on it. The Death of a God [1] . Circa 1933. Two handwritten manuscripts; a third manuscript is published as “The Death of a God [2]”. The Death of a God [2] . Circa 1933. One handwritten manuscript. The Inconscient and the Traveller Fire .

No title in the manuscript. April 1934. Sri Aurobindo wrote the first part of this poem (down to “gloried fields of trance”) on 25 April 1934 after Dilip Kumar Roy asked him for some lines in alexandrines ( Sri Aurobindo Came to Me , pp. 226 – 29). In an accompanying letter, he explained how the caesura dividing the lines into two parts could come after different syllables. Dilip, noting that in Sri Aurobindo’s passage there were examples of the caesura falling after the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth syllables, asked for an example of a line with the caesura coming after the third syllable. Sri Aurobindo obliged by sending him the couplet: And in the silence of the mind life knows itself Immortal, and immaculately grows divine. On 28 April 1934, three days after Sri Aurobindo sent the first passage, his secretary asked him: “Can your last poem (in Alexandrines, sent to Dilip) be put into circulation?” Sri Aurobindo replied: “No. It is not even half finished.” He wrote two more passages but never wove the three together into a completed poem. The editors have reproduced the passages as they are found in Sri Aurobindo’s notebooks and loose sheets, separating the three passages by blank lines. A strong son of lightning . No title in the manuscript. Circa 1934. Three handwritten manuscripts. I made danger my helper . No title in the manuscript. Circa 1934. Two handwritten manuscripts. Sri Aurobindo wrote these four lines on the back of a typed manuscript of “The World Game”. They do not, however, appear to have been intended for inclusion in that poem. The metre is not the same as, though possibly related to, the metre of “The World Game”. The Inconscient . Circa 1934. Four handwritten manuscripts. In gleam Konarak . No title in the manuscript. Circa 1934 – 35. A single handwritten manuscript on the back of a sheet used for a draft of “Thought the Paraclete”, which is dated 31 December 1934.

A PPENDIX :P OEMS IN G REEK AND IN F RENCH As a student in England Sri Aurobindo wrote many poems in Greek and in Latin as school or college assignments. A typical assignment would be to render an English poem into Greek or Latin verse of a given metre. The Greek epigram below appears to be an example of such an assignment. Sri Aurobindo also learned French in England, and in later years wrote two poems in that language. Greek Epigram . January 1892. Sri Aurobindo wrote this epigram in a notebook he used at Cambridge. At the end he wrote “Jan. 1892 (Por- son Schol)”. This refers to the Porson Scholarship examination, which was held at Cambridge that month. In order to win this scholarship, candidates had to take twelve papers over the course of a week. One of the papers required contestants to provide a Greek translation of the following poem by Richard Carlton (born circa 1558), an English madrigal composer: The witless boy that blind is to behold Yet blinded sees what in our fancy lies With smiling looks and hairs of curled gold Hath oft entrapped and oft deceived the wise. No wit can serve his fancy to remove, For finest wits are soonest thralled to love. Sir Edmund Leach, late provost of King’s College, Cambridge, who provided the information on the scholarship examination, went on to add: It is possible that [Sri Aurobindo] Ghose was a candidate for the Porson Scholarship; alternatively it is possible that his King’s College supervisor set him the Porson Scholarship paper as an exercise to provide practice for the Classical Tripos examination which he was due to take in June 1892."},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"730 Collected Poems Sri Aurobindo’s epigram is not a literal translation of the English poem, but an adaptation of it in Greek verse. Transliterated into the Latin alphabet, the Greek text reads as follows: M ̄ oros Er ̄ os alaos th’; ho d’hom ̄ os ha g’eni phresi keitai H ̄ em ̄ on, ophthalmous ̄ on alaos kathora.

Sri Aurobindo seems to have written this prose poem during a fairly early period of his stay in Pondicherry. Published here for the first time. Sur les grands sommets blancs . No title in the manuscript. Circa 1927. Sri Aurobindo wrote this incompl ete poem in a notebook he used otherwise for the Record of Yoga of 1927. P UBLICATION H ISTORY During his lifetime, Sri Aurobindo published poetry in a number of periodicals: Fox’s Weekly (1883), Bande Mataram (1907), The Mod- ern Review (1909, 1910), Karmayogin (1909, 1910), Shama’a (1921), The Calcutta Review (1934), Sri Aurobindo Circle (1948, 1949), and others. He also published poetry in twelve books: Songs to Myrtilla and Other Poems (c. 1898), Urvasie (c. 1899), Ahana and Other Po- ems (1915), Love and Death (1921), Baji Prabhou (1922), Six Poems (1934), Poems (1941), Collected Poems and Plays (1942), On Quan- titative Metre (1942), Poems Past and Present (1946), Chitrangada (1949) and Savitri (1950 – 51). Details on the first editions of all these books except the last two may be found in the above notes. Four of the books had further editions during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime: Songs to Myrtilla (1923), Urvasie (c. 1905), Love and Death (1924, 1948), and Baji Prabhou (1949). Collected Poems and Plays was the first attempt to bring out a comprehensive edition of Sri Aurobindo’s known poetic output. It was planned by Nolini Kanta Gupta for release on 15 August 1942, Sri"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"Note on the Texts 731 Aurobindo’s seventieth birthday. Following Sri Aurobindo’s instruc- tions that “only poems already published should be included in this collection”, Nolini collected all poems, poetic translations and plays that had been published until then, typed them and sent them to Sri Aurobindo for revision. The book was published by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, and printed at the Government Central Press, Hyderabad. Work on the book extended from around February to August 1942. Between 1950 and 1971 a number of poems that had remained unpublished at the time of Sri Aurobindo’s passing were printed in various journals connected with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and in three books: Last Poems (1952), More Poems (1957) and Ilion (1957). In 1971, all of Sri Aurobindo’s known poetical works were published in Collected Poems: The Complete Poetical Works , volume 5 of the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library. A few other poems were included in the Supplement (volume 27) to the Centenary Library in 1973. About a dozen poems discovered between then and 1985 were pub- lished in the journal Sri Aurobindo: Archives and Research . The first almost complete collection of Sri Aurobindo’s Sonnets was published in 1980. Lyrical Poems 1930 – 1950 came out in 2002. In the present volume are collected all previously published poems and at least three that appear here for the first time in print: “Thou bright choregus”, “All here is Spirit” and “Lorsque rien n’existait”. The poems have been arranged chronologically. As far as possible, books published during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime have been presented in their original form. The texts of all the poems have been checked against the author’s manuscripts and printed editions."},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"Index of Titles Adwaita 621 Ahana 475 All here is Spirit 597
