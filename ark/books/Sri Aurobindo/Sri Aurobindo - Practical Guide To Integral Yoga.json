Under the Divine Wisdom^ the earth has evolved from matter to plant life and then to animal life. Evolution from animal to man is not the final stage. Humanity is under the sway of dark and ignorant forces and that is the reason for human sufferings, disease and death all the signs of imperfection. It is clear that man has to progress towards a Light which brings knowledge, power, huppiness, love, beauty and even physical immortality. The Divine is the essence of the whole universe and to realise and possess Him should be the supreme aim of human life. To acquire all the qualities of the Divine is the final purpose of Nature's evolution. Mere ideas and ideals, mere talk about God and the Good cannot help. Nor can performance of religious rites really help. A firm resolution should spring from one's heart to realise the Divine, and nothing else should matter. Emotional enthusiasm does not by itself go very far. One must be ready to pass through the hard ordeals of the spiritual path. One cannot persist to the end unless one keeps the will firm and draws on the support of an inner strength. The soul progresses by gathering experiences in the ordinary life but it is a very long> slow and devious process from birth to birth. Yoga hastens the soul's development. The"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA progress that can be made in many lives is made in a few years by the help of Yoga. Just as modern science has advanced greatly over past researches and brought new truths and powers, the Yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother has also made a momentous advancement over all past Yogas. It is called the \"Integral Yoga\" or the \"Supramental Yoga\". Where the past Yogas end, this new Integral Yoga starts. The Yogas* of the past were only of ascent to the Spirit, Sri Aurobindo's Yoga is both of ascent and descent. One can realise the Divine in consciousness by the old Yogas but cannot establish the Divine on earth in a collective no less than in an individual physical life. In the old Yogas the world was considered either an illusion or a transitional phase : it had no prospect of having all the terms of its exis- tence fulfilled. Sri Aurobindo says that the world is a real creation of the Divine and life in it can be completely divinised,, down to the very cells of the body. A Kingdom of God on earth can be brought about in the most literal sense by a total transformation of collective men. To put it in Sri Aurobindo's words : \"Here and not else- where the highest Godhead has to be found., the soul's divine nature developed out of the imperfect physical human nature and through unity with God and man and universe the whole large truth of being discovered and lived and made visibly wonderful. That completes the long cycle of our becoming and admits us to a supreme result; that is the opportunity given to the soul by the human birth and, until that is accomplished, it cannot cease.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PREFACE 3 For this transformation a new power called the \"Super- mind\" which was sealed to this earth till now is needed. By its manifestation in earth-nature a supreme evolution is made possible. The Mother has declared recently that at last the Super- mind has manifested. It is now only a question of time to have its increasing effect in world-life. This new Light will work everywhere in general but it will be more effective in those who come into direct contact with the Masters of this Yoga and take up the Yogic life in earnest. More and more people, in India as well as abroad, are drawn towards Sri Aurobindo and the Mother and are anxious to know their teachings. A need is felt to collect these teachings in a single book which would combine brevity with many-sidedness and serve as an introduction to the new path. We hope the present collection will prove helpful to all sincere aspirants.

This alone is man's real business in the world and the justification of his existence, without which he would be only an insect crawling among other ephemeral insects on a speck of surface mud and water which has managed to form itself amid the appalling immensities of the physical universe. (ii) Whoever clings to desires and weaknesses of the flesh, the cravings and passions of the vital in its turbulent ignorance, the dictates of his personal mind unsilenced and unillumined by a greater knowledge, cannot find the true inner law and is heaping obstacles in the way of the divine fulfilment.

No attach- ment, desire or habit of the mind, heart, vital- being or body should be clung to which come in the way of this one aspiration and one object of life. One must be ready to renounce all these completely as soon as the demand comes from above and the Divine Shakti. (iv) First, the consciousness must be transformed, then life, then the forms. It is in this order that the new creation will happen. All Nature's acti- vity is, in fact, a progressive return towards the Supreme Reality which is at once the origin and the goal of the universe, in its totality as well as in its smallest element ; we have to become con- cretely what we are essentially. We must live integrally the truth, the beauty, the power and the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTORY perfection hidden in the depth of our being. It is then that all life will become the expression of the sublime, eternal, divine Joy. (v) Some give their soul to the Divine, some their life, some offer their work, some their money. A few consecrate all of themselves and all they have soul, life, work, wealth ; these are the true children of God. Others give nothing these, whatever their position, power and riches, are for the Divine purpose valueless cyphers. (vi) The Adverse Powers are the forces and beings that are interested in maintaining the falsehoods they have created in the world of the Ignorance and in putting them forward as the Truth which men must follow. In India they are termed Asuras, Rakshasas, Pishachas who are in opposition to the Gods, the Powers of Light. These too are Powers, for they too have their cosmic field in which they exercise their function and authority and some of them were once divine Powers who have fallen towards the darkness by revolt against the divine Will behind the cosmos."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA As for the Mother and myself, we have had to try all the ways, follow all methods, to sur- mount mountains of difficulties, a far heavier burden to bear than you or anybody else in the Ashram or outside, far more difficult conditions, battles to fight, wounds to endure, ways to cleave through impenetrable morass and desert and forest, hostile masses to conquer a work such as, I am certain, none else had to do before us. For the leader of the way in a work like ours has not only to bring down or represent and embody the Divine, but to represent too the ascending element in humanity and to bear the burden of humanity to the full and experience, not in a mere play or Lila but in grim earnest, all the obstruction, difficulty, opposition, baffled, hampered and only slowly victorious labour which are possible on the path.... It is because we have the complete experience that we can show a straighter and easier road to others if they will only consent to take it. It is because of our experience won at a tremendous price that we can urge it upon you and others.

There will be much inner struggle and much outer struggle too. So I shall tell you of the atti- tude you should take in such circumstances. Indeed the more things become difficult, the quieter you should remain, the more unshakable the faith you should have. When difficulties come, human beings usually get agitated, excited, nervous and so make the difficulties hundredfold more difficult. The difficulties may last perhaps more than the twelve months of the year, may extend to fourteen months. It is in the nature of things. The nature of the struggle determines the measure of its duration. The forces must come up to a certain pitch of activity to produce a certain result. We make use of time in the measure of our small human duration. But naturally Divine Forces have not the same measure as we have and that may appear to us too long or too uncertain. For the Divine, however, that is the shortest way, in spite of everything, to the goal aimed at. The goal is the fulfilment of the Divine Will, whatever it is. Given the circumstances, the Divine always"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"IO A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA takes the shortest way, although that may seem to us the longest, or tortuous and uncertain. Be- cause we do not see the whole, we see just a little fragment which is according to our pro- portions. Our vision is narrow, narrow with regard to what is behind, narrow with regard to what is ahead. Man's vision is limited ; he can- not see very much beyond his nose. Human vision is linear, that is to say, things present themselves to it one after another in a line. Divine vision is different ; it is total, it is global : it looks at the problem integrally, that is to say, from all sides, in the round, not from one side or at one point ; the supreme vision takes in all sides and aspects at a glance, not only on the sur- face, but in the depth too. It embraces all the elements of the question and resolves the ques- tion without neglecting any of the points involved in it. Man, on the contrary, follows a straight line ; anything that is not on the straight line escapes his notice, and if it were left to his choice, these other things would not get done. The Divine's way is circular and yet it is the most direct. The adverse forces have always tried to push back the divine Realisation as much as possible, to maintain their hold upon the world as long as possible. That struggle seems now to have come to a head at last. It is their final chance.

They are engaged in a tremendous battle upon this earth ; for it is upon this earth that the victory has to be won, the victory that will decide the course of earth's future.

Sri Aurobindo's View : The world, as it is, is not the divine creation it is meant to be, but an obscure and perverted ex- pression of it. It is not the expression of the divine consciousness and will, but this is what it is meant to become; it has been created to develop into a perfect manifestation of the Divine under all His forms and aspects Light and Knowledge, Power, Love and Beauty. This is our conception of it and the aim we follow. 24-2-1936 THE MOTHER TO THE CHILDREN OF THE ASHRAM THERE is an ascending evolution in nature which goes from the stone to the plant, from the plant to the animal, from the animal to man. Because man is, for the moment, the last rung at the summit of the ascending evolution,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTORY 15 he considers himself as the final stage in this ascension and believes there can be nothing on earth superior to him. In that he is mis- taken. In his physical nature he is yet almost wholly an animal, a thinking and speaking ani- mal, but still an animal in his material habits and instincts. Undoubtedly, nature cannot be satisfied with such an imperfect result ; she endeavours to bring out a being who will be to man what man is to the animal, a being who will remain a man in its external form, and yet whose consciousness will rise far above the mental and its slavery to ignorance. Sri Aurobindo came upon earth to teach this truth to men. He told them that man is only a transitional being living in a mental conscious- ness, but with the possibility of acquiring a new consciousness, the Truth-consciousness, and capable of living a life perfectly harmonious, good and beautiful, happy and fully conscious. During the whole -of his life upon earth, Sri Aurobindo gave all his time to establish in himself this consciousness he called supramental, .and to help those gathered around him to realise it.

Now, all depends on your will and your sin- cerity. If you have the will no more to belong to ordinary humanity, no more to be merely evolved animals ; if your will is to become men of the new race realising Sri Aurobindo's supramental ideal, living a new and higher life upon a new earth, you will find here all the necessary help to achieve your purpose ; you will profit fully by your stay in the Ashram and eventually become living examples for the world. 24-7-1951 THE MOTHER"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"HUMANITY Its Present Condition and Need THE whole aim of the material man is to live, to pass from birth to death with as much comfort or enjoyment as may be on the way, but anyhow to live.... The cus- tomary routine, the customary institutions, the inherited or habitual forms of thought, these things are the life-breath of their nostrils.... To the material man the living progressive thinker is an ideologue, dreamer or madman. The surfaces of life are easy to understand ; their laws, characteristic movements, practical utilities are ready to our hand and we can seize on them and turn them to account with a sufficient facility and rapidity. But they do not carry us very far. They suffice for an active superficial life from day to day, but they do not solve the great problems of existence. The word civilisation so used comes to have a merely relative significance or hardly any fixed sense at all. 2"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"1 8 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA We must therefore get rid in it of all that is temporary or accidental and fix it upon this distinction that bar- barism is the state of society in which man is almost entirely preoccupied with his life and body, his eco- nomic and physical existence.... It is obvious that in a state of barbarism the rude beginnings of civilisation may exist ; it is obvious too that in a civilised society a great mass of barbarism or numerous relics of it may exist. In that sense all societies are semi-civilised. Man is an abnormal who has not found his own normality, he may imagine he has, he may appear to be normal in his own kind, but that normality is only a sort of provisional order ; therefore, though^ man is infinitely greater than the plant or the animal, lie is not perfect in his own nature like the plant and the animal. This imperfection is not a thing to be at all deplored, but rather a previlege and a promise, for it opens out to us an immense vista of self-development and self-exceeding. The Divine is infinite and immortal being; the human is life limited in time and scope and form, life that is death attempting to become life that is immortality."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"HUMANITY 19 In subhuman life of animal there is a vital and phy- sical struggle, but no mental conflict. Man is subject to this mental conflict and is therefore at war not only with others but with himself; and because he is capable of this war with himself, he is also capable of that which is denied to the animal, of an inner evolution, a progres- sion from higher to higher type, a constant self- transcending. The true business of man upon earth is to express in the type of humanity a growing image of the Divine ; whether knowingly or unknowingly, it is to this end that Nature is working in him under the thick veil of her inner and outer processes. But the material or animal man is ignorant of the inner aim of life ; he knows only its needs and its desires and he has necessarily no other guide to what is required of him than his own perception of need and his own stirrings and pointings of desire. The Self of man is a thing hidden and occult ; it is not his body, it is not his life, it is not even though he is in the scale of evolution the mental being, the Manu, his mind.

We miss the divine reality in man and the secret of the human birth if we do not see that each individual man is that Self and sums up all human potentiality in his own being. That potentiality he has to find, develop, work out from within. The knowledge of God is not to be gained by weighing the feeble arguments of reason for or against his exis- tence ; it is to be gained only by a self-transcending and absolute consecration, aspiration and experience. Nor does that experience proceed by anything like rational scientific experiment or rational philosophic thinking. Man's road to spiritual supermanhood will be open when he declares boldly that all he has yet developed, including the intellect of which he is so rightly and yet so vainly proud, are now no longer sufficient for him, and that to uncase, discover, set free this greater Light within shall be henceforward his pervading preoccupation."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"DIVINE LILA (Play) WE play at being bound, we are not really bound. We can be free when God wills; for He, our Supreme Self, is the master of the game, and without His Grace and permission no soul can leave the game. The command is now. God always keeps for him- self a chosen country in which the higher knowledge is through all chances and dangers, by the few or the many, continually preserved, and for the present, in this chaturyuga at least, that country is India. Whenever He chooses to take the full pleasure of ignorance, of the dualities, of strife and wrath and tears and weak- ness and selfishness, the tamasic and rajasic pleasures, of the play of the Kali in short, He dims the knowledge in India and puts her down into weakness and degra- dation so that she may retire into herself and not inter- fere with this movement of His lila. When he wants to rise up from the mud and Narayana in man to become once again mighty and wise and blissful, then He once more pours out the knowledge on India and raises her up so that she may give the knowledge with its necessary consequences of might, wisdom and bliss to the whole world. When there is the contracted movement of knowledge, the Yogins in India with- draw from the world and practise Yoga for their own liberation and delight or for the liberation of a few"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA disciples ; but when the movement of knowledge again expands and the soul of India expands with it, they come forth once more and work in the world and for the world. Yogins like Janaka, Ajatshatru and Karta- virya once more sit on the thrones of the world and govern the nations. God's lila in man moves always in a circle, from Satyayuga to Kaliyuga and through Kaliyuga to the Satyayuga, from the age of gold to the age of iron and back again through the iron to the gold.... But the Kali- yuga is not merely evil; in it the necessary conditions are progressively built up for a new Satyayuga, another harmony, a more advanced perfection. It is only India that can discover the harmony, because it is only by a change not a mere readjustment of man's present nature that it can be developed, and such a change is not possible except by Yoga. The nature of man and of things is at present a discord, a harmony that has gone out of tune. The whole heart and action and mind of man must be changed, but from within, not from without, not by political and social institutions, not even by creeds and philosophies, but by realisation of God in ourselves and the world and a remoulding of life by that realisation. This can only be effected by Purna-Yoga, a Yoga devoted to the fulfilment of the divine humanity in ourselves and others. For this Puma-Yoga, the surrender must be complete. Nothing must be reserved, no desire, no demand, no opinion, no idea that this must be, that cannot be, that"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"DIVINE LILA (PLAY) 23 this should be and that should not be; all must be given.

The reason for which the Avatars descend is to raise up man again and again, developing in him a higher and ever higher humanity, a greater and yet greater develop- ment of divine being, bringing more and more of heaven again and again upon the earth until our toil is done, our work accomplished and Sachchidananda fulfilled in all even here, even in this material universe.

The object of our Yoga is to bring down the supra- mental consciousness on earth, to fix it there, to create a new race with the principle of the supramental con- sciousness governing the inner and outer individual and collective life. This Yoga does not mean the rejection of the powers of life, but an inner transformation and a change of the spirit in the life and the use of the powers. These powers are now used in an egoistic spirit and for undivine ends; they have to be used in a spirit of surrender to the Divine and for the purpose of the divine Work.

The object is transformation, and the transformation can only be done by a force infinitely greater than your own; it can only be done by being truly like a child in the hands of the Divine Mother. The object of our Yoga is to enter into and be possessed by the Divine Presence and Consciousness, to love the Divine for the Divine's sake alone, to be tuned in our nature into the nature of the Divine, and in our will and works and life to be the instrument of the Divine.

Nature seeks the divine in her own symbols: Yoga goes beyond Nature to the Lord of Nature, beyond universe to the Transcendent and can return with the transcendent light and power, with the fiat of the Omnipotent. * Here the soul lives in a material universe; of that alone it is immediately conscious; the realisation of its poten- tialities in that are the problem with which it is concerned. But matter means the involution of the conscious delight of existence in self-oblivious force and in a self-dividing, infinitesimally disaggregated form of substance. There- fore the whole principle and effort of a material world must be the evolution of what is involved and the deve- lopment of what is undeveloped. Here everything is shut up from the first in the violently working incon- scient sleep of material force; therefore the whole aim of any material becoming must be the waking of conscious- ness out of the inconscient; the whole consummation of a material becoming must be the removal of the veil of matter and the luminous revelation of the entirely self- conscient Being to its own imprisoned soul in the be- coming. Since Man is such an imprisoned soul, this luminous liberation and coming to self-knowledge must be his highest object and the condition of his perfection.

The physical body is therefore a basis of action, pratistha, which cannot be despised, neglected or excluded from the spiritual evolu- tion: a perfection of the body as the outer instrument of a complete divine living on earth will be necessarily a part of the gnostic conversion. The Mother: The general aim to be attained is the advent of a pro- gressing universal harmony, and individualise the states of being that were never till now conscious in man and, by that, to put the earth in connection with one or more of the fountains of universal force that are still sealed to it. The only way to become a conscious being, to be one- self, is to unite with the divine Self that is in all. For that, we must, by the aid of concentration, isolate ourselves from external influences.

To master oneself means to do what one has decided to do, to do nothing but that, not to listen to or follow impulses, desires or fancies. The whole world is in a process of progressive trans- formation; if you take up the discipline of Yoga, you speed up in yourself this process. The work that would require years in the ordinary course, can be done by Yoga in a few days and even in a few hours. Our goal is not to lose oneself in the Divine Conscious- ness. The goal is to let the Divine Consciousness penetrate into Matter and transform it. Ours is neither a political nor a social but a spiritual goal.

If one is to prepare for Yoga by the study of books, this preparation would take rather long. But it goes much quicker when one receives directly a teaching which is at one's disposal in all circumstances.... Indeed they who are predestined receive the help of the inner Guide. At the right moment they come across the book they should read or the person who can give them the right indication.... It goes without saying that it is easier for those who are here in India. India maintains her living tradition. An aspirant for Yoga will always find someone who can give him the teaching. Even the most ignorant and the most uncultured possess in them a vague feeling of what is to be done or what can help. But if you transplant yourself to the West, you will see how difficult it is.... Now the situation is somewhat better, there has been some progress, the light has spread a little every- where.... Note this particularly, you are given a full freedom of choice; if you decide within yourself that you will reach the goal in this life, you will do so in that case you can succeed even in twelve months....

Perhaps they need turning round and round, falling back, going about in circuitous ways before they arrive where they should arrive. Unfortunately it is exactly people who have this habit of loitering, wandering away from the straight line, that most complain of the way being long; they lament, but they themselves are the artisans of their own misery. But to each his choice. What cannot be acquired or conquered during life can certainly not be done after death. The physical life is the true field for progress and realisation.

This is an exceedingly difficult aim and difficult Yoga; to many or most it will seem impossible. All the established forces of the ordinary ignorant world-consciousness are opposed to it and deny it and try to prevent it, and the Sadhak will find his own mind, life and body full of the most obstinate impediments to its realisation. If you can accept the ideal whole-heartedly, face all difficulties, leave the past and its ties behind you and are ready to give up everything and risk everything for this divine possi- bility, then only can you hope to discover by experience the Truth behind it. Asceticism for its own sake is not the ideal of this Yoga, but self-control in the vital and right order in the material are a very important part of it and even an ascetic discipline is better for our purpose than a loose absence of true control. Mastery of the material implies in it the right and careful utilisation of things and also a self-control in their use. Forceful suppression (fasting also comes under the head) stands on the same level as free indulgence; in both cases, the desire remains: in the one it is fed by indulgence, in the other it lies latent and exasperated by suppression."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"34 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA Those who seek the Self by the old Yogas separate themselves from mind, life and body and realise the self and then they proceed from realisation of Self to Nirvana or some Heaven and abandon life.

This Yoga is \"new\" because it aims at the integrality of the Divine in this world. The Sadhaka of integral Yoga who stops short at the Impersonal is no longer a sadhaka of integral Yoga. Without the action of the integral Divine there is no change of the whole nature.

It is a training ground for those who have to pass through the difficult and complex way of this Yoga and none other. All work here must be done in a spirit of acceptance, discipline and surrender, not with personal demands and conditions, but with a vigilant conscious submission to control and guidance.... The fundamental difference is in the teaching that there is a dynamic divine Truth and that into the present world of Ignorance that Truth can descend, create a new Truth-consciousness and divinise Life. The old Yogas go straight from mind to the absolute Divine, regard all dynamic existence as Ignorance, Illusion or Lila; when you enter the static and immutable Divine Truth, they say, you pass out of cosmic existence.... My aim is to realise and also to manifest the Divine in the world, bringing down for the purpose a yet unmani- fested Power, such as the Supermind. I have to bring it into the cosmic formula and, if so, I must realise the cosmic Divine and become conscious of the cosmic self and the cosmic forces.

This Yoga is not a Yoga of world-shunning asceticism, but of divine life. This Yoga accepts the value of cosmic existence and holds it to be a reality; its object is to enter into a higher Truth-Consciousness in which action and creation are the expression not of ignorance and imperfection, but of the Truth, the Light, the Divine Ananda. But for that, surrender of the mortal mind, life and body to that Higher Consciousness is indispensable, since it is too difficult for the mortal human being to pass by its own effort beyond mind to a Supramental Consciousness in which the dynamism is no longer mental but of quite another power. Only those who can accept the call to- such a change should enter into this Yoga. My Yoga is new as compared with the old Yogas: (i) Because it aims not at a departure out of world and life into Heaven or Nirvana, but at a change of life and existence, not as something subordinate or incidental, but as a distinct and central object.

The thing to be gained also is the bringing in of a Power of Consciousness (the Supramental) not yet organised or active directly in earth-nature, even in the spiritual life, but yet to be organised and made directly active. (3) Because a method has been preconized for achieving this purpose which is as total and integral as the aim set before it, viz., the total and integral change of the consciousness and nature, taking up old methods but only as a part action and present aid to others that are distinctive. I have not found this method (as a whole) or anything like it professed or realised in the old Yogas. If I had, I should not have wasted my time in hewing out paths and in thirty years of search and inner creation when I could have hastened home safely to my goal in an easy canter over paths already blazed out, laid down, perfectly mapped, macadamised, made secure and public.

It is not intended to supramentalise humanity at large, but to establish the principle of the Supramental con- sciousness in the earth-evolution. If that is done, all that is needed will be evolved by the Supramental Power itself. It is not therefore important that the mission should be wide-spread. What is important is that the thing should be done at all in however small a number; that is the only difficulty. It is in the waking state that this realisation must come and endure in order to be a reality of the life. If experienced in trance it will be a superconscient state only for some part of the inner being but not real to the whole consciousness.

The object of the sadhana is opening of the conscious- ness to the Divine and the change of the nature. Medita- tion or contemplation is one means to this but only one means; bhakti is another; work is another. Chitta- shuddhi was preached by the Yogins as a first means towards realisation and they got by it the saintliness of the saint and the quietude of the sage but the transforma- tion of the nature of which we speak is something more than that, and this transformation does not come by contemplation alone; works are necessary.

In our Yoga the Nirvana is the beginning of the higher Truth, as it is the passage from the Ignorance to the higher Truth. The Ignorance has to be extinguished in order that the Truth may manifest. The Jain philosophy is concerned with individual perfection. Our effort is quite different. We want to bring down the Supermind as a new faculty. Just as the mind is now a permanent state of consciousness in humanity, so also we want to create a race in which the Supermind will be a permanent state of consciousness. You seem not to have understood the principle of this Yoga. The old Yoga demanded a complete renun- ciation extending to the giving up of the worldly life itself. This Yoga aims instead at a new and transformed life. But it insists as inexorably on a complete throwing away of desire and attachment in the mind, life and body.

The power that works in this Yoga is of a thorough- going character and tolerates in the end nothing great or small, that is an obstacle to the Truth and its realisation. The traditions of the past are very great in their own place, in the past, but I do not see why we should merely repeat them and not go farther. In the spiritual develop- ment of the consciousness upon earth the great past ought to be followed by a greater future. All other Yogas regard this life as an illusion or a passing phase; the supramental Yoga alone regards it as a thing created by the Divine for a progressive manifes- tation and takes the fulfilment of the life and the body for its object.

All other utilisation of Yoga is for special and fragmentary advantages not always worth pursuing. Only that which aims at possessing the fulness of God is Purna Yoga or Integral Yoga. All Yoga which takes us entirely away from the world,, is a high but narrow specialisation of divine tapasya. God in His perfection embraces everything, we also must become all-embracing. In brief, by Yoga, we have to replace dualities by unity, egoism by divine consciousness, ignorance by divine wisdom, thought by divine knowledge, weakness, struggle and effort by self-contented divine force, pain and false pleasure by divine bliss. This is called in the language of Christ bringing down the kingdom of heaven on earth, or in modern language, realising and effectuating God in the world. The principle of this Yoga is not a perfection of humait nature as it is, but a psychic and spiritual transformation of all the parts of the being through the action of an inner consciousness and then of a higher consciousness which works on them, throws out the old movements or changes them into an image of its own and so transmutes the lower"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PAST YOGAS AND THE INTEGRAL YOGA 4 into higher nature.

This is a slow and difficult process; the road is long and it is hard to establish even the necessary basis. The old existing nature resists and obstructs and difficulties rise one after another, till they are overcome. Yoga of the Gita Our Yoga is not identical with the Yoga of the Gita although it contains all that is essential in the Gita's Yoga. In our Yoga we begin with the idea, the will,, the aspiration of the complete surrender ; but at the same time we have to reject the lower nature, deliver our consciousness from it, deliver the self involved in the lower nature by the self rising to freedom in the higher nature. The full truth is in the supramental consciousness and the power to work from there on life and Matter. The Gita does not speak expressly of the Divine Mother ; it speaks always of surrender to the Purushot- tama it mentions her only as the Para Prakriti who becomes the Jiva, that is, who manifests the Divine in the multiplicity and through whom all these worlds are created by the Supreme and he himself descends-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"44 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA as the Avatar. The Gita follows the Vedantic tradition which leans entirely on the Ishwara aspect of the Divine and speaks little of the Divine Mother because its object is to draw back from world-nature and arrive at the supreme realisation beyond it; the Tantric tradition leans on the Shakti or Ishwari aspect and makes all depend on the Divine Mother because its object is to possess and dominate the world-nature and arrive at the supreme realisation through it. This Yoga insists on both the aspects ; the surrender to the Divine Mother is essential for without it there is no fulfilment of the object of the Yoga. The Gita at its cryptic close may seem by its silence to stop short of that solution for which we are seeking; it pauses at the borders of the highest spiritual mind and does not cross them into the splendours of the supramental Light. I suggested the Gita method for you because the opening which is necessary for the Yoga here seems to be too difficult for you.

The manifestation of the Divine in the Avatar is of help to man because it helps him to discover his own divinity, find the way to realise it. There are two sides of the phenomenon of Avatar- hood, the Divine Consciousness and the instrumental personality. The Divine Consciousness is omnipotent but it has put forth the instrumental personality in Nature under the conditions of Nature and it uses it according to the rules of the game though also sometime to change the rules of the game. The Divine does not need to suffer or struggle for himself; if he takes on these things it is in order to bear the world-burden and help the world and men.

The third dream was a world-union forming the outer basis of a fairer, brighter and nobler life for all man- kind. That unification of the human world is under way ; there is an imperfect initiation organised but struggling against tremendous difficulties. Another dream, the spiritual gift of India to the world has already begun. India's spirituality is entering Europe and America in an ever increasing measure....

I have also been given the power to read men's characters and hearts, even their thoughts, but this power is not yet absolutely complete, nor can I use it always and in all cases. My communication with the other world is yet of a troubled character, though I am certainly in communication with some very great powers. But of all these things I will write more when the final obstacles in my way are cleared from the path. What I perceive more clearly, is that the principal object of my Yoga is to remove absolutely and entirely every possible source of error and ineffectiveness, of error in order that the Truth I shall eventually show to men may be perfect, and of ineffectiveness in order that the work of changing the world, so far as I have to assist it, may be entirely victorious and irresistible. It is for this reason that I have been going through so long a discipline and that the more brilliant and mighty results of Yoga have been so long withheld. I have been kept busy laying down the foundation, a work severe and painful. It is only now that the edifice is beginning to rise upon the sure and perfect foundation that has been laid. My Yoga is proceeding with great rapidity, but I defer writing to you of the results until certain experiments in which I am now engaged, have yielded fruit sufficient to establish beyond dispute the theory and system of Yoga which I have formed and which is giving great results not only to me, but to the young men who are with"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"60 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA me. ...I expect these results within a month, if all goes well. The whole earth is now under one law and answers to the same vibrations and I am sceptical of finding any place where the clash of the struggle will not pursue us. In any case, an effective retirement does not seem to be my destiny. I must remain in touch with the world until I have either mastered adverse circumstances or succumbed or carried on the struggle between the spiritual and physical so far as I am destined to carry it on. This is how I have always seen things and still see them. One needs to have a calm heart, a settled will, entire self-abnegation and the eyes constantly fixed on the beyond to live undiscouraged in times like these which are truly a period of universal decomposition. For myself, I follow the Voice and look neither to right nor to left of me. The result is not mine and hardly at all now even the labour.

The Mother is the conscious- ness and force of the Supreme and far above all she creates. But personally too the Mother has stooped to descend here into the Darkness that she may lead it to the Light, into the Falsehood and Error that she may convert it to the Truth, into this Death that she may turn it to godlike Life, into this world-pain and its obstinate sorrow and suffering that she may end it in the transforming ecstasy of her sublime Ananda.

The Mother's consciousness and mine are the same, the one Divine Consciousness in two, because that is neces- sary for the play. Nothing can be done without her knowledge and force, without her consciousness if any- body really feels her consciousness, he should know that I am there behind it and if he feels me it is the same with hers. The Mother's consciousness is the divine conscious- ness and the Light that comes from it is the light of the Divine Truth. One who receives and accepts and lives in the Mother's light, will begin to see the truth on all the planes, the mental, the vital, the physical. It is not necessary for us always to be physically con- scious of the action, for it is often carried out when the mind is occupied with outward things or when we sleep. The Mother's sleep is not sleep but an inner conscious- ness in which she is in connection with people or working everywhere.

Besides that, wherever the Force is working, the Presence is there. Mother's embodiment is a chance for the earth-con- sciousness to receive the Supramental into it and to undergo first the transformation necessary for that to be possible. Afterwards there will be a further transfor- mation by the Supramental. There is one divine Force which acts in the universe and in the individual and is also beyond the individual and the universe. The Mother stands for all these, but she is working here in the body to bring down something not yet expressed in this material world so as to trans- form life here it is so that you should regard her as the Divine Shakti working here for that purpose. She is that in the body, but in her whole consciousness she is also identified with all the other aspects of the Divine.

You must not lose sight of that, that it is through the Mother that all things are attained. The relation which exists between the Mother and all who accept her is a psychic and spiritual motherhood. It is a far greater relation than that of the physical mother to her child; it gives all that human motherhood can give, but in a much higher way, and it contains in itself infinitely more. If the sadhak becomes unfaithful to the Mother, it means that he did not want the sadhana or the Mother but the satisfaction of his desires and his ego. That is not Yoga. Mother has taken the body because a work of a physical nature, including a change in the physical world, had to be done. Some have come with her to share in the work, others she had called, others have come seeking for the light. With each she has a personal relation or a possi- bility of the personal relation, but each is of its own kind. To apply the silly mathematical rules of the physical mind here is absurd. Your physical mind cannot understand what the Mother does, its values and standards and ideas are not hers. It is still worse to make your personal vital demand or desire the measure of what she ought to do. She acts in each case for different reasons suitable to that case."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"SRI AUROBINDO ON THE MOTHER 65 Whether in work or in Yoga the Mother acts not from the mind or from the level of consciousness from which these criticisms arise, but from quite another vision and consciousness. If people want to understand why the Mother does things, let them get into the same inner consciousness from which she sees and acts. As to what she is, that also can only be seen either with the eye of faith or of a deeper vision. It is the Purusha and Prakriti sides of the nature one leading to pure conscious existence, static, the other to pure conscious force, dynamic the Mother. If I give, the Mother's force goes with it, or else the sadhak would get nothing, and if the Mother gives, my support goes with it and gives it my light as well as the Mother's. It is two sides of one indivisible action one carrying with it the other. It is the Mother's Force that gives the push. The Mother proposition is true. If one is open to Sri Aurobindo and not to the Mother it means that one is not really open to Sri Aurobindo.

The surrender must be total and seize all the parts of the being.

Reject the false notion that the divine Power will do and is bound to do everything for you at your demand and even though you do not satisfy the conditions laid down by the Supreme.

The Supreme demands your surrender to her, but does not impose it; you are free at every moment, till the irrevocable transformation comes, to deny and to reject the Divine or to recall your self-giving, if you are willing to suffer the spiritual consequences. Your surrender must be self-made and free; it must be the surrender of a living being, not of an inert automaton or mechanical tool. A glad and strong and helpful submission is demanded to the working of the Divine Force, the obedience of the illumined disciple of the Truth, of the inner Warrior who fights against obscurity and falsehood, of the faithful servarft of the Divine. So long as the lower nature is active the personal effort of the sadhaka remains necessary. The personal effort required is a triple labour of aspiration, rejection and surrender: (i) An aspiration vigilant, constant, unceasing. (ii) Rejection of the movements of the lower nature. (iii) Surrender of oneself and all one is and has. In proportion as the surrender and self-consecration progress, the Sadhaka becomes conscious of the Divine Shakti doing the sadhana. The more this conscious process replaces his own effort, the more rapid and true becomes his progress.

It is only by faith, aspi- ration and surrender that this self-opening can come. It is not by taking a mere mental attitude that this can be done or even by any number of inner experiences which leave the outer man as he was. It is this outer man who has to open, to surrender and to change.

When the mind falls quiet and the concentration becomes strong and the aspiration intense, then there is a beginning of experience. The more the faith, the more rapid the result is likely to be. The bhakta does not rely on his own effort alone, but on the grace and power of the Divine whom he adores. There are always difficulties and a hampered progress in the early stages and a delay in the opening of the inner doors until the being is ready. The road of Yoga is long, every inch of ground has to be won against much resis- tance and no quality is more needed by the sadhak than patience and single-minded perseverance with a faith that remains firm through all difficulties, delays and apparent ^failures. Each part of the nature wants to go on with its old movements and refuses, so far as it can, to admit a radical change and progress, because that Would subject it to something higher than itself and deprive it of its sove- reignty in its own field, its separate empire.

The rule in Yoga is not to let the depression depress you, to stand back from it, observe its cause and remove the cause. The Yogi should look on all the defects of the nature as movements of the lower prakriti common to all and reject them calmly, firmly and persistently with full confidence in the Divine Power. However hard the fight, the only thing is to fight it out now and here to the end. The goal of Yoga is always hard to reach, but this one is more difficult than any other, and it is only for those who have the call, the capacity, the willingness to face everything and every risk, even the risk of failure, and the will to progress towards an entire selflessness, desire- lessness and surrender.

The psychic does not demand or desire it aspires; it does not make conditions for its surrender or withdraw if its aspiration is not immediately satisfied for the psychic has the complete trust in the Divine or in the Guru and can wait for the right time or the hour of the Divine Grace.

By remaining physically open to the Mother, all that is necessary for work or sadhana develops progressively, that is one of the chief secrets, the central secret of the sadhana. To practise Yoga implies the will to overcome all attachments and turn to the Divine alone. The principal thing in the Yoga is to trust in the Divine Grace at every step, to direct the thought continually to the Divine and to offer oneself till the being opens and the Mother's force can be felt working in the Adhara. To remain open to the Mother is to remain always quiet and happy and confident not restless, not grieving or despondent, to let her force work in you, guide you, give you knowledge, give you peace and Ananda. It is by the constant remembrance that the being is prepared for the full opening.

But the human approach to the Divine should not be constantly turned into a human revolt and reproach against it. The power needed in Yoga is the power to go through effort, difficulty or trouble without getting fatigued, depressed, discouraged or impatient and without breaking off the effort or giving up one's aim or resolution. A quiet vigilant but undistressed persistence is the best way to get the sadhana done. It is because the vital is restless and full of desires that it is like that.

A fire is burning there, in the deep quietude of the heart. It is the divinity in you your true being. Hear its voice, follow its dictates. To prepare oneself for the Yoga, one should be con- scious, first of all. We are conscious of only an insignificant portion of our being; for the most part we are unconscious. It is this unconsciousness that keeps us down to our unregenerate nature and prevents change and trans- formation in it. It is through unconsciousness that the undivine forces enter into us and make us their slaves. You are to be conscious of yourself; that is to say, reso- lutely reject one and accept the other. The duality will present itself at every step and at every step you will have to make your choice. You will have to be patient and persistent and vigilant. Yoga does become dangerous if you want it for your own sake, to serve a personal end. Dangers and diffi- culties come in when people take up Yoga, not for the sake of the Divine, but because they want to acquire power and under the guise of Yoga seek to satisfy some ambition. If you cannot get rid of ambition, do not touch the thing. It is fire that burns. There are two paths of Yoga, one of tapasya (discipline) and the other of surrender.

The first effect of Yoga, however, is to take away the mental control, and the hungers that lie dormant are suddenly set free, they rush up and invade the being. So long as this mental control has not been replaced by the Divine control, there is a period of transition when your sincerity and surrender will be put to test. The impulses and desires that come up by the pressure of Yoga should be faced in a spirit of detachment and serenity, as something foreign to yourself or belonging to the outside world. They should be offered to the Divine, so that the Divine may take them up and transmute them. If you have once opened yourself to the Divine, if the power of the Divine has once come down into you and yet you try to keep to the old forces, you prepare troubles and difficulties and dangers for yourself.

You must go inside yourself and enter into a complete dedication to the spiritual life. All clinging to mental preferences must fall away from you, all insistence on vital aims and interests and attachments must be put away, all egoistic clinging to family, friends, country must disappear if you want to succeed in Yoga. The ways of the Divine are not like those of the human mind or according to our patterns and it is impossible to judge them or to lay down for Him what He shall or shall not do, for the Divine knows better than we can know. Not to impose one's mind and vital will on the Divine but to receive the Divine's will and follow it, is the true attitude of sadhana. Fix upon your mind and heart the resolution to live for the Divine Truth and for that alone ; reject all that is contrary and incompatible with it and turn away from the lower desires ; aspire to open yourself to the Divine Power and to no other. Do this in all sincerity and the present and living help you need will not fail you. The necessities of a sadhaka should be as few as pos- sible; for there are only a very few things that are real necessities in life.

If he has any greed, desire, demand, claim for possession or enjoyment, any anxiety, grief, anger or vexation when denied or deprived, he is not free in spirit and his use of the things he possesses is contrary to the spirit of sadhana.

To remain within, above and untouched, full of the inner consciousness and the inner experience, listening when need be to one or another with the surface conscious- ness, but with even that undisturbed, not either pulled outwards or invaded that is the perfect condition for the sadhana.

Do nothing, try to think and feel nothing that would be unworthy of the Divine Presence. It is not Yoga to give free play to the natural instincts and desires.

It is the past habit of the vital that makes you repeatedly go out into the external part; you must persist and estab- lish the opposite habit of living in your inner being which is your true being and of looking at everything from there.

One can be a conscious and perfect instrument only when one is no longer acting in obedience to the ignorant push of the lower nature but in surrender to the Mother and aware of her higher Force acting within oneself. One must be vigilant, but not anxious and uneasy. The Mother's Force will act and bring the result in its own time, provided one offers all to her and aspires and is vigilant, calling and remembering her at all times, rejecting quietly all that stands in the way of the action of her transforming Force. There should be not only a general attitude, but each work should be offered to the Mother so as to keep the attitude a living one all the time. There should be at the time of work no meditation, for that would withdraw the attention from the work, but there should be the constant memory of the One to whom you offer it.

What one has to do is to put oneself in the Mother's hands and open oneself to her by service, by bhakti, by aspiration; then the Mother by her light and force works in him so that the sadhana is done. It is a mistake also to have the ambition to be a big Purna Yogi or a supra- mental being and ask oneself how far have I got towards that. The right attitude is to be devoted and given to the Mother and to wish to be whatever she wants you to be. The rest is for the Mother to decide and do in you. There is one thing everybody should remember that everything should be done from the point of view of Yoga, of sadhana, of growing into a divine life in the Mother's consciousness. To insist upon one's own mind and its ideas, to allow oneself to be governed by one's own vital feelings and reactions should not be the rule of life here.

But there is another, a hidden conscious- ness within behind the surface one in which we can become aware of the real Self and of a larger, deeper truth of nature, can realise the Self and liberate and transform the nature. To quiet the surface mind and begin to live within is the object of this concentration. To concentrate in the heart centre with the offering of oneself to the Divine and the aspiration for this inward opening and for the Presence in the heart is the first way and, if it can be done, the natural beginning ; for its result once obtained makes the spiritual path far more easy and safe than if one begins the other way but to begin with the heart centre, if one can do it, is the more desirable. One must say \"Since I want 'only the Divine, my success is sure, I have only to walk forward in all con- fidence and His own Hand will be there secretly leading me to Him by His own way and at His own time\".

What I have said is that you should not expect the Divine or insist on it at once or within an early time. It can come early or it can come late, but come it will if one is faithful in one's call. * Harmony and not strife is the law of yogic living. The aim here is fulfilment of the Divine in Life and for that, union and solidarity are indispensable. All jealousy, strife,, hatred, aversion, rancour and other evil vital feelings should be abandoned as they can be no part of the spiri- tual life. So, also, all egoistic love and attachment will have to disappear the love that loves only for the ego's sake and, as soon as the ego is hurt and dissatisfied, ceases to love or even cherishes rancour and hate.

If you can do this, the sadhana is likely to go on progressing and enlarging itself with a minimum of trouble and disturbance. You must gather yourself within more firmly. If you disperse yourself constantly, go out of the inner circle, you will constantly move about in the pettiness of the ordinary outer nature and under the influences to which it is open.

But your mind and vital don't want to admit that, because it is always their preoccupation to justify their own movements. If the psychic were allowed its full predominance, this would not happen. It is not advisable to cut oneself off from mixing with people altogether. You must remain in the higher con- sciousness even when with people.

The distinguishing feature of Dhyana is that it puts out a steady force of knowledge on the object of knowledge. Concentration is a gathering together of the conscious- ness and either centralising at one point or turning on a single object, e.g., the Divine ; there can also be a gathered condition throughout the whole being, not at a point. In meditation it is not indispensable to gather like this, one can simply remain with a quiet mind thinking of one subject or observing what comes in the consciousness and dealing with it.... Concentration means fixing the consciousness in one place or on one object and in a single condition. Medi- tation can be diffusive, e.g., thinking about the Divine, receiving impressions and discriminating, watching what goes on in the nature and acting upon it etc. The best help for concentration is to receive the Mother's calm and peace into your mind.

If it is too persistent, a steady rejection without strain or struggle is the one thing to be done. The two main places where one can centre the con- sciousness for Yoga are in the head and in the heart. The sitting motionless posture is the natural posture for concentrated meditation walking and standing are active conditions. One can accustom oneself to meditate walk- ing, standing, lying but sitting is the first natural position. It is better to make the deeper concentration when you are alone or quiet. Outward sounds ought not to disturb you. The concentration is in its nature quiet and steady. If there is restlessness or over-eagerness, then that is not concentration. There are always two things that can rise up and assail the silence, vital suggestions, the physical mind's mechanical recurrences. Calm rejection for both is the cure. One can remain separate and see the thoughts and imaginations pass without being affected, but that is not being plunged or engrossed in meditation. You have asked what is the discipline to be followed in order to convert the mental seeking into a living spiritual experience. The first necessity is the practice of concentration of your consciousness within yourself."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Il6 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA The ordinary human mind has an activity on the surface which veils the real self. But there is another, a hidden consciousness within behind the surface one in which we can become aware of the real self and of a larger deeper truth of nature, can realise the self and liberate and transform the nature. To quiet the surface mind and begin to live within is the object of this concentration. Of this true consciousness other than the superficial there are two main centres, one in the heart (not the physical heart but the cardiac centre in the middle of the chest,) one in the head. The concentration in the heart opens within and by following this inward opening and going deep one becomes aware of the soul or psychic being, the divine element in the individual. This being unveiled begins to come forward, to govern the nature, to turn it and all its movements towards the Truth, to- wards the Divine, and to call down into it all that is above. It brings the consciousness of the Presence, the dedica- tion of the being to the Highest and invites the descent into our nature of a greater Force and Consciousness which is waiting above us. To concentrate in the heart centre with the offering of oneself to the Divine and the aspiration for this inward opening and for the Presence in the heart is the first way and, if it can be done, the natural beginning; for its result once obtained makes the spiritual path far more easy and safe than if one begins the other way....

Concentration is necessary, first, to turn the whole will and mind from the discursive divagation natural to them, following a dispersed movement of the thoughts, running after many-branching desires, led away in the track of the senses and the outward mental response to phenomena : we have to fix the will and the thought on the eternal and real behind all, and this demands an im- mense effort, a one-pointed concentration. Secondly, it is necessary in order to break down the veil which is erected by our ordinary mentality between ourselves and the truth; for our knowledge can be picked up by the way, by ordinary attention and reception, but the inner, hidden and higher truth can only be seized by an absolute concentration of the mind on its object, an absolute concentration of the will to attain it and, once attained, to hold it habitually and securely unite oneself with it.

That too not many but a selected few. It is most important to have an inner vision and discrimination in choosing people for meditation. It is a meditation which has the power to transform your being, a meditation which is progressive. Usually people do not have a dynamic meditation. When they enter into what they call meditation, it is a kind of immobi- lity in which nothing changes; they come out of it just as they entered into it, without any progress either in their being or in their consciousness. They could meditate in this way for eternities and it would bring no change either in themselves or in the universe. That is why Sri Aurobindo speaks of dynamic meditation, for it is just the contrary : it is transforming meditation. PEACE The first thing to do in the sadhana is to get a settled peace and silence in the mind. Otherwise you may have experiences, but nothing will be permanent.

In Yoga one uses the inner will and compels the vital to submit itself to tapasya so that it may become calm, strong, obedient. The vital is a good instrument but a bad master.

The more it gets the more it demands and it takes everything as its right and every denial of what it wants as an injustice and an offence. The unregenerate vital in the average human nature is not grateful for a benefit, it resents being under an obligation. So long as the benefit continues, it is effusive and says sweet things, as soon as it expects nothing more it turns round and bites the hands that fed it. Sometimes it does that even before, when it thinks it can do it without the benefactor knowing the origin of the slander, fault- finding or abuse.

But the inner test is severe and constant, one must be very sincere in the aspiration to surmount all egoism and to conquer all vanity in order to be able to stay here. A complete surrender is not outwardly exacted but it is indispensable for those who wish to stick on, and many things come to test the sincerity of this surrender.

The Divine Consciousness is not bound by these things and has no attachment, but it is also not bound to abstain from them if beauty in things is part of its intended action. The Mother, when the Ashram was still unformed, was wearing patched cotton saris. When she took up the work, it was necessary to change her habits, so she did so. * To find highest beauty is to find God; to reveal, to embody, to create as we say, highest beauty is to bring out of our souls the living image and power of God* * The Mother : It is one of the greatest weapons of the Asura at work when you are taught to shun beauty. It has been the ruin of India. The Divine manifests in the psychic as love, in the mind as knowledge, in the vital as power and in the physical as beauty.

When one does sadhana, the inner conscious ness begins to open and one is able to go inside and have all kinds of experiences there. As the sadhana progresses, one begins to live more and more in this inner being and the outer becomes more and more superficial. At first the inner consciousness seems to be the dream and the outer the waking reality. After- wards the inner consciousness becomes the reality and the outer is felt by many as a dream or delusion, or else something superficial and external. The inner consciousness begins to be a place of deep peace, light, happiness, love, closeness to the Divine or the presence of the Divine, the Mother.

The psychic being is there in all, but in very few it is well developed, well built up in the consciousness or prominent in the front; in most it is veiled, often in- effective or only an influence, not conscious enough or strong enough to support the spiritual life. It is for this reason that it is necessary for those drawn towards this Truth to come here in order that they may receive the touch which will bring about or prepare the awakening of the psychic being that is for them the beginning of the effective psychic contact. When the touch has been given or the development effected, so far as the sadhak is at the moment capable of it, he returns to the outside world and under the pro- tection and guidance even at a distance is able to keep the contact and go on with his spiritual life. But the influences of the outside world are not favourable to the psychic contact and the psychic development and, if the sadhak is not sufficiently careful or concentrated, the psychic contact may easily be lost after a time or get covered over and the development may become retarded,, stationary or even diminished by adverse movements or influences. It is for that the necessity exists and is often felt of a return to the place of the central influence in order to fortify or recover the contact or to restore or give a fresh forward impulse to the development.

The right attitude to approach the Mother when she sees one is to keep the being perfectly quiet and open to receive, without any activity of the mind or desire in the vital, with only the surrender and the psychic readiness to accept whatever is given. The physical contact of the Mother means for her an interchange, a pouring out of her forces and a receiving of things good, bad and mixed from them which often involves a great labour of adjustment and elimination, and in many cases, a severe strain on the body. The best way for Darshan is to keep oneself very col- lected and quiet and open to receive whatever the Mother gives. During Darshans and Blessings, the time has nothing to do with it. One hour's touch or a moment's touch as much can be given by the one as by the other. The Mother gives in both ways. Through the eyes it is to the psychic, through the hand to the material.

Finally the soul or psychic being retires into the psychic world to rest there till a new birth is close.

If the mind and vital and the body itself were more conscious and plastic, death would not be necessary. * At the time of death the being goes out of the body through the head; it goes out in the subtle body and goes to different planes of existence for a short time until it has gone through certain experiences which are the result of its earthly existence.

The throat centre Visuddha governs the expressive and externalising mind. The centre between the eye-brows Ajndcakra governs the dynamic mind, will, vision, mental formation.

Mind : The mind is a part of the nature which has to do with cognition and intelligence, with ideas, with mental or thought perceptions, the reactions of thought to things, with the truly mental movements and forma- tions, mental vision and will etc. that are part of his intelligence. Vital : The vital has to be carefully distinguished from mind, even though it has a mind element transfused into it; the vital is the Life nature made up of desires, sensa- tions, feelings, passions, energies of action, will of desire, reactions of the desire soul in man and of all that play of possessive and other related instincts, anger, fear, greed, lust etc. that belong to this field of the naturp. Composition of man : The being of man is composed of these elements the psychic being behind supporting all the inner mental, vital and physical, and the outer, quite external nature of mind, life and body which is their instrument of expression. But above all is the central being (Jivatma) which uses them all for its manifestation : it is a portion of the Divine Self.

Faithfulness means to admit and to manifest no other movements but only the movements prompted and guided by the Divine.

Sincerity exacts the unification and harmonisation of the whole being in all its parts and movements around the central Divine Will.

In the ordinary con- sciousness of the body there is a more or less hidden anxiety about the consequences of the slightest physical disturbance. It can be translated by these words of doubt about the future : \"And what will happen ?\" it is this anxiety that must be checked. Indeed this anxiety is a lack of confidence in the Divine's Grace, the unmistakable sign that the consecration is not complete and perfect. As a practical means of overcoming this subconscient fear each time that something of it comes at the surface, the more enlightened part of the being must impress on the body the necessity of an entire trust in the Divine's Grace, the certitude that this Grace is always working for the best in ourself as well as in all, and the deter- mination to submit entirely and unreservedly to the Divine's Will. The body must know and be convinced that its essence is divine and that if no obstacle is put in the way of the Divine's working nothing can harm us.

The soul is not divided from God by these barriers of material dimensions. What is true of matter is not true of Spirit, nor do the standards of form apply to the formless. For Matter is conscious being confined in form, the spirit is conscious being using form but not confined in it; and it is the privilege of spirit that though indivisible in its pure being, it is freely self-divisible in its conscious experience and can concentrate itself in many states at a time. * Even the truth of physical things cannot be entirely known, nor can the right use of our material existence"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"314 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA be discovered by physical Science and an outward knowledge alone or made possible by the mastery of physical and mechanical processes alone : to know, to use rightly we must go beyond the truth of physical phenomenon and process, we must know what is within and behind it.

The religious life may be the first approach to the spiritual, but very often it is only a turning about in a round of rites, ceremonies and practices of set ideas and forms without any issue. The spiritual life, on the contrary, proceeds directly by a change of consciousness, a change from the ordinary consciousness, ignorant and separated from its true self and from God, to a greater consciousness in which one finds one's true being and comes first into direct and living contact and then into union with the Divine. For the spiritual seeker this change of consciousness is the one thing he seeks and nothing else matters. Morality is a part of the ordinary life; it is an attempt to govern the outward conduct by certain mental rules or to form the character by these rules in the image of a certain mental ideal.

The moral consciousness acts in the same way in the social body as tapasya in the spiritual domain. There is a great difference between spirituality and morality, two things that are constantly confused with each other. The spiritual life has for its object to grow into the divine consciousness. Morality proceeds by mental constructions with the idea of good or bad and sets up an ideal type into which all must force them- selves. This moral ideal differs in its constituents and its ensemble in different times and different places. And it proclaims itself as a unique type and it admits of none other outside itself. Morality lifts up one artificial standard contrary to the variety of life and the freedom of the spirit. Morality is not divine or of the Divine; it is of man and human.

It does not at all mean that she has more affection for one than for another, or those she touches in a particular way are better sadhaks or less so. The sadhaks think in that way because they are full of ignorance and ego. Instead of thinking whether the Mother favours one more or the other less, comparing and watching what she does, they ought to be concerned at Pranam with only their own spiritual reception of her influence.

All bad thoughts upon the Mother or throwing of impurities on her may affect her body as she has taken the sadhaks into her consciousness ; nor can she send these things back to them as it might hurt them. If the Mother were able to bring out the Divine personalities and Powers into her body and physical being as she was doing for several months without break some years ago, the brightest period in the history of the Ashram, things would be much more easy and all these dangerous attacks that now take place would be dealt with rapidly and would in fact be impossible. In those days when the Mother was either receiving the sadhaks for meditation or otherwise working and concentrating all night and day without sleep and with very irregular food, there was no ill-health and no fatigue in her and things were proceeding with a light- ning swiftness.

The beings of this plane are often hostile to the true aim of spiritual life and establish contact with the seeker and offer him powers and occult experiences only in order that they may lead him away from the spiritual path or else that they may establish their own control over him or take possession of him for their own purpose.

It is only with an intensive mental development that these capacities fade away in children and often end by disappearing altogether. In all ages, there were upon earth isolated individuals or small groups ; they used to practise this type of science. They sought for especially gifted souls and gave them the necessary training. Usually these groups lived a more or less secret or hidden life because ordinary people are very intolerant of this kind of capacities and activities which pass their understanding and frighten them. In all the domains of human activity, there are charla- tans and imposters. But the fraud practised by them should not throw discredit upon a true science which they falsely boast they possess. That is why in the great epochs when this science flourished, when there were recognised schools where it was practised, whoever wanted to undertake this study, before being admitted, was made to go through, for a long time, sometimes even for years, a twofold discipline of a very strict nature, that of self-development and self-mastery. In this way the height and nobility of the candidate's aspiration was proved.

Occult knowledge without the spiritual discipline is, if it falls into impure hands, a dangerous instrument for one who uses it as well as for others. Spiritual know- ledge without the occult science lacks in precision and certainty in its objective effects : it is all-powerful only in the subjective world.

And the first law of creation was"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"OCCULT HISTORY OF MAN 333 freedom of decision. These Beings were manifestations in the free movement of the Divine; they themselves moved free, according to their individualised conscious will. Soon, however, they stood out no longer on the Divine, but moved out of him, away and separate; they sought to fulfil their individualised will and destiny. The first fruit, the inevitable reaction of freedom was precisely a separation from the Divine, each one encircled within its ego, limited and bound to its own fund of potency : individualism means limitation and the Four Independents lapsed into their opposites : Light changed to Darkness, i.e. Consciousness to Unconsciousness > Truth changed to Falsehood, Delight changed to Pain and Suffering, and Life changed to Death. That is how the four undivine principles, the Powers of the Undivine came to rule and fashion the material creation. Into the heart of this Darkness and Falsehood and Pain and Death, a seed was sown, a grain that is to be the epitome and symbol of material creation and in and through which the Divine will claim back all the elements gone astray, the prodigal ones who will return to recognise and fulfil the Divine. That was Earth. And the earth, in her turn, in her labour towards the Divine Fulfilment, out of her bosom, threw up a being who would again symbolise and epitomise the earth and material creation.

If they get free from these three slaveries, they will truly be the equal of men. Men also have three slaveries : (1) Spirit of possession, attachment to power and domination, (2) Desire for sexual relation with woman, (3) Attachments to the small comforts of married life. If they get rid of these three slaveries, they can truly become the equal of women. * Man feels himself superior and wants to dominate, the woman feels oppressed and revolts, openly or secretly; and the eternal quarrel between the sexes continues from age to age, identical in essence, innumerable in its forms and shades."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"336 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA It is well understood that mart throws the who e blame upon the woman, as woman in the same way throws the entire blame upon man.

In their mutual relations, man and woman are, at once and towards each other, quite despotic masters and somewhat pitiable slaves. Yes, slaves; for so long as you have desires and pre- ferences and attachments, you are a slave of these things and of those persons on whom you depend for their fulfilment. That is why no law can liberate women unless they free themselves : men too, likewise, cannot, in spite of all their habits of domination, cease to be slaves unless they are freed from all their inner slavery. This state of secret conflict, often not admitted, but always present in the subconscious, even in the best cases, seems inevitable, unless human beings rise above their ordinary consciousness to identify themselves with the perfect consciousness, to be unified with the supreme Reality.

Later on the dis- ciples could not agree on what the Master had said and there grew up a host of sects and sub-sects in the body of the parent-religion, each of them claiming to be the only, the original, the undefiled doctrine of the Buddha. The same fate overtook the teaching of the Christ. All religions have each the same story to tell. The Teacher comes and reveals the Truth but men seize upon it, trade upon it, make an almost political organisation out of it.

It is for this meaningful development of consciousness by thought, will, emotion, desire, action and experience, leading in the end to a supreme divine self-discovery, that Man, the mental being, has entered into the material body. The aim set be- fore our Yoga is nothing less than to hasten this supreme object of our existence here. It is this new birth that we make our aim : a growth into a divine consciousness is the whole meaning of our Yoga, an integral conversion to divinity not only of the soul but of all the parts of our nature.... The Gita at its cryptic close may seem by its silence to stop short of that solution for which we are seeking; it pauses at the borders of the highest spiritual mind and does not cross them into the splendours of the supra- mental Light....

To the soul that wholly gives itself to him, God also gives himself altogether. Only the one who offers his whole nature, finds the Self. Only the one who can give everything, enjoys the Divine All everywhere. Only a supreme self-abandonment attains to the Supreme. Only the sublimation by sacrifice of all that we are, can enable us to embody the Highest and live here in the immanent consciousness of the transcendent Spirit.... The practice of this Yoga of sacrifice compels us to renounce all the inner supports of egoism, casting them out of our m'nd and will and actions, and to eliminate its seed, its presence, its influence out of our nature. All must be done for the Divine; all must be directed to- wards the Divine. Nothing must be attempted for our- selves as a separate existence; nothing done for others, whether neighbours, friends, family, country or mankind or other creatures merely because they are connected with our personal life and thought and sentiment or because the ego takes a preferential interest in their welfare....

It is for this that a surrender and submission to That which is beyond us enabling the full and free working of its Power is indispensable. As that self-giving pro- gresses, the work of the sacrifice becomes easier and more powerful and the prevention of the opposing Forces loses much of its strength, impulsion and substance.... The extreme solution insisted on by the world-shun- ning ascetic or the inward-turned ecstatical and self- oblivious mystic is evidently foreign to the purpose of an integral Yoga; for if we are to realise the Divine in the world, it cannot be done by leaving aside the world- action and action itself altogether. The spiritualisation of both the inward being and the outward life and not a compromise between life and the spirit is the goal of which we are the seekers....

This physical mind of inertia of the ignorant man believes in no divinity other than its small earth-gods; it aspires perhaps to a greater comfort, order, pleasure, but asks for no uplifting and spiritual deliverance. A principle of dark and dull inertia is at its base; all are tied down by the body and its needs and desires to a trivial mind, petty desires and emotions, an insignificant repetition of small worthless functionings, needs, cares, occupations, pains, pleasures that lead to nothing beyond themselves and bear the stamp of an ignorance that knows not its own why and whither.... Life is indispensable to the completeness of the crea- tive spiritual realisation, but life released, transformed, uplifted, not the ordinary mentalised human-animal life, nor the demoniac or Titanic, not even the divine and the undivine mixed together.

The soul of desire is a separative soul of ego and all its instincts are for a separative self-affirmation. It is when there is this death of desire and this calm equal wideness in the consciousness everywhere, that the true vital being within us comes out from the veil and reveals its own calm, intense and potent presence....

The true business of man upon earth is to express in the type of humanity a growing image of the Divine; whe her knowingly or unknowingly, it is to this end that Nature is working in him under the thick veil of her inner and outer processes. But the material or animal man is ignorant of the inner aim of life; he knows only its needs and its desires and he has necessarily no other guide to what is required of him than his own perception of need and his own stirrings and pointings of desire....

So long as we work with attachment to the result, the sacrifice is offered not to the Divine, but to our ego. We may think otherwise, but we are deceiving ourselves; we are making our idea of the Divine, our sense of duty, our feeling for our fellow-creatures, our idea of what is good for the world or others, even our obedience to the Master a ma$k for our egoistic satisfactions and preferences and a specious shield against the demand made on us to root all desire out of our natures....

It is still the \"I\" that chooses and determines, it is still the \"I\" that undertakes the responsibility and feels the demerit or tho merit.

A great sincerity is asked for and has to be imposed not only on the conscious mind but still more on the subli- minal part of us which is full of hidden movements. For there is there, especially in our subliminal vital nature, an incorrigible charlatan and actor. The sadhaka must first have advanced far in the elimination of desire and in the firm equality of his soul towards all workings and all happenings before he can utterly lay down the burden of his works on the Divine. At every moment he must proceed with a vigilant eye upon the deceits of the ego and the ambushes of the misleading Powers of Darkness. Wherever desire and ego harbour, passion and disturbance harbour with them and share their life.... The Master of the work does not reveal himself at once to the seeker.

In our present life of Nature, in our externalised surface existence, it is the world that sesms to create us; but in the turn to the spiritual life it is we who must create ourselves and our world. In this new formula of creation, the inner life becomes of the first importance and the rest can be only its expression and outcome.... In the growth into a divine life the spirit must be our first preoccupation; until we have revealed and evolved it in our self out of its mental, vital, physical wrappings and disguises, extricated it with patience from our own body, as the Upanishad puts it, until we have built up in ourselves an inner life of the spirit, it is obvious that no outer divine living can become possible....

But there would be nothing supernatural or miraculous in such an evolution, except in so far as it would be a supernature or superior nature to ours just as human nature is a supernature or superior nature to that of animal or plant or material objects....

To be free from constant dangers of conflict and destruction the man of today has to grow inwardly as well as outwardly. In his present condition man lives in ignorance. He does not know how he thinks and how he acts. He has no true goal but wastes his whole life driven by passions and endless desires. His life is full of miseries, sufferings, disharmony, discords, disease and death. In fact, man is an animal, a thinking and speaking animal but still an animal in his instincts and habits. The creature of water cannot dream of the creation on land. The animal kingdom though on land cannot get the least idea of man's capacities. So with man also.

With the final perfection, man's life will be one of knowledge, love, beauty, harmony and joy ; quite free from sufferings, miseries, disease and death. Because we are creatures of this world, our con- sciousness is always externalised and we look at things and happenings from the outer surface, having no knowledge whatsoever of the real causes and effects of the different forces and influences of the subtle worlds working behind them. We can see and feel only the results on the material plane and nothing more. Our senses have a very limited scope and they can give us the knowledge of the things which are only materialised. But, in fact, that is not all that we are. We have another part in ourselves which is veiled by the external con- sciousness, and we call that our Soul the part of the Divinity within, which is ONE everywhere the True Self. As our senses give us the knowledge of external things by directing our consciousness outwardly, in the same way if we can direct our consciousness inwardly and rise into the inner consciousness, we can know the things of the higher worlds. We have to take an entire turn in our consciousness and go beyond the limitations of our physical senses, then only can we have the true knowledge of this world and the worlds beyond and that practice is called TOGA'.

That is to raise the consciousness to a stage of Bliss and fix it there. They had not much to do with the life here and with this world. They considered this world as an illusion and not worth living in. Yoga was practised for personal salvation and the world at large had no gain out of it. People in the past could not achieve the highest summits of realisation and did not know the purpose of this crea- tion : hence they declared the world to be an illusion. The Divine, though ONE, has two aspects one is static and the other dynamic. The dynamic side of the Divine is the energy or the creative side and the Maha Shakti or the Divine Mother stands for it. People in the past realised only the static aspect of the Divine and did not know much of the dynamic side as it is much more difficult to realise it. For this reason, the purpose of the creation was not understood by them and they declared the world to be futile and deceptive. That means either the Divine was unable to make a perfect world and he had no purpose in the creation or man has not been able to understand the same. Sri Aurobindo's Yoga gives the full experience of both the aspects of the Divine, that is why he calls his Yoga the Integral Yoga or the Perfect Yoga. Sri Aurobindo says the Divine is real and His creation is bound to be real. It is only Sri Aurobindo who has shown to the world the purpose of the creation and has declared that the world is still in an imperfect condition and passing through the transitory period towards its perfection.

The meaning of the word * Yoga', in its true sense is to *join' join our external consciousness with our true self the Divine within ourselves which is ONE every- where. By the practice of Yoga, our consciousness expands as wide as the universe and far beyond. To practise Yoga it is indispensable to have a Guru or a Master, who has a thorough knowledge of the path and a capacity to guide and protect his disciples from all the dangers of the unknown spheres arising either from too powerful lights or from adverse beings of different worlds. The Mother once said : \"Be faithful to your Guru whoever he is, he will lead you as far as you can go. But if you are lucky enough to have the Divine as your Guru then there will be no limit to your realisation\". At the juncture of some new evolution on earth, the Divine takes the lead. He manifests in a form necessary for the purpose and brings a new light with him that will help the evolution and bring about a change in the course of time. Hindus in India believe in such manifes- tations and also believe that there have been ten mani- festations since the beginning of the creation on earth the first being the Matsya Avatara (the Fish), then Kurma (the Tortoise), then Varaha (the Boar), then Nri- simha (the Man-Lion) and so on. These manifestations"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"AN OUTLINE OF INTEGRAL YOGA 415 show the gradations of evolution on earth. The Fish Manifestation brought a creation in water, the Tortoise brought the first creation on land, the Boar Manifestation brought a creation of developed land animals and the Man-Lion brought a further evolution from animal towards man and so on. We need, today, a new manifestation which can put the present humanity under a new cosmic power and bring about a new evolution of the present man and the world. Sri Aurobindo once said that the coming evolution will be the final stage for this world. It will be a world of perfect harmony, love, beauty, knowledge and Ananda. The consciousness and the life of the present man will be transformed and a new race will be created. To effectuate the above result, a new higher power is required to be established upon earth and made native to this world. That power Sri Aurobindo calls the Supra- mental Power or the Truth-Consciousness. That Supra- mental power alone has the capacity to transform the life of man and change the world conditions. Both the Divine Mother and Sri Aurobindo have manifested upon earth to bring about this new evolution and prepare the necessary conditions on earth for the establishment of -the Supramental Light. Unless the conditions are created the new -Light cannot stay here permanently. When divine manifestations take place, they have also to pass through great difficulties and sufferings as a result of oppositions of dark and anti-divine forces which have"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"416 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INTEGRAL YOGA had a hold upon earth since the creation. Those dark powers always oppose the new Lights because they do not want to give up their grip on the earth and sometimes their hostility even takes the form of war on earth, but in spite of all obstructions the Divine Will succeeds at last. For these reasons, to bring about a radical and collective change, Sri Aurobindo had to take a voluntary decision to leave his body in December 1950, and fight out certain forces in the subtle world. When that conquest on the subtle plane is made and the necessary conditions also are prepared by the Mother in the world atmosphere, Sri Aurobindo, with the help of the Mother, will manifest in a physical form in a divine body without taking a normal human birth. That will be the first supramental body in this world built in the supramental way. Side by side with the first effect of that new Light the Mother's physical body will be transformed and perfected. It will be a fully divinised and immortal body free from disease and death, free from inertia, plastic and luminous with an all-pervading consciousness, perfect knowledge and un- limited powers. The influence of that Divine Manifesta- tion will grow increasingly in the world and change the world conditions and the present earthly life of man. Those who will be ready to receive the new Light will be profited greatly. This is the perfect Yoga for the new evolution which transforms mind, life and body of man. People in ignorance fall into discussions and say that the Divine is everywhere and ask what the necessity is for the manifestations. In reply it can be said that electri*"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"AN OUTLINE OF INTEGRAL YOGA 417 city is everywhere in the atmosphere, as all the scientists declare, and it does work also in the world atmosphere according to the cosmic law; yet, to make the electric power effective for our material use, some conditions are required to be created on the material plane such as dynamos and generators etc. In the same way the Divine also acts in the world atmosphere according to the cosmic law. The Divine is still in a veiled form in this world and has not yet manifested Himself in his full Glory. To es- tablish new Powers and Lights in the world for the evolutionary principles, the Divine has to take a physical form from time to time till the final evolution is effected. Such manifestations serve the purpose of generators and dynamos on the material plane. The Mother herself has said : \"Since the beginning of the earth wherever and whenever there was the possibility of manifesting a ray of the Consciousness, I was there\" It is the Overmind that governs the earth at present and the higher gods and goddesses belong to that plane of consciousness. Supermind is much higher than Overmind. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother have manifested from the Supramental Plane : that is why their powers are much more creative and effective on earth than any god or goddess known to this world. For the final stage of evolution the Divine will manifest in His full Power in an unveiled form. We may hope that the time is not very far now when Sri Aurobindo will manifest in a divine body with his full Glory, remove all tensions from the world-atmosphere and save the earth."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"41 8 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO INT^JRAL YOGA To begin their Yoga, the first necessities for man are aspiration, faith, devotion, sincerity and rejection of falsehood with a crowning goal of complete and unreserved surrender of the whole being in all its parts mental, vital and physical, to the Divine alone and to no other influence of the lower Nature. The more the surrender progresses the more concretely the dynamic and conscious Force of the Divine Mother works for and in the sadhaka and carries out the purification and transformation of the whole being. As the divine influence of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother is well established in the whole world atmosphere, the aspirant from any corner of the world can receive the help and protection from them according to the intensity and sincerity of his aspiration and can progress gradually in spirituality. By sincere aspiration, faith and devotion one can progress in consciousness even at a distance, but for a complete transformation down to the physical it is in- evitable to come physically in direct contact with the Masters of this Integral Yoga. Spirituality is not morality but much higher. Morality is based on human mental standards of good and evil while spirituality is based on the Spirit or the Divine Consciousness.
