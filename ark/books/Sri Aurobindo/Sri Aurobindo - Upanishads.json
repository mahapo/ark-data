The Upanishads are at once profoundreligious scriptures, — for they are a record of the deepest spiritualexperiences, — documents of revelatory and intuitive philosophy of aninexhaustible light, power and largeness and, whether written in verse orcadenced prose, spiritual poems of an absolute, an unfailing inspirationinevitable in phrase, wonderful in rhythm and expression. It is the expressionof a mind in which philosophy and religion and poetry are made one, because thisreligion does not end with a cult nor is limited to a religio-ethicalaspiration, but rises to an infinite discovery of God, of Self, of our highestand whole reality of spirit and being and speaks out of an ecstasy of luminousknowledge and an ecstasy of moved and fulfilled experience, this philosophy isnot an abstract intellectual speculation about Truth or a structure of thelogical intelligence, but Truth seen, felt, lived, held by the inmost mind andsoul in the joy of utterance of an assured discovery and possession, and thispoetry is the work of the aesthetic mind lifted up beyond its ordinary field toexpress the wonder and beauty of the rarest spiritual self-vision and theprofoundest illumined truth of self and God and universe. Here the intuitivemind and intimate psychological experience of the Vedic seers passes into asupreme culmination in which the Spirit, as is said in a phrase of the KathaUpanishad, discloses its own very body, reveals the very word of itsself-expression and discovers to the mind the vibration of rhythms whichrepeating themselves within in the spiritual hearing seem to build up the souland set it satisfied and complete on the heights of self-knowledge.This character of the Upanishads needs to be insisted upon with a strongemphasis, because it is ignored by foreign translators who seek to bring out theintellectual sense without feeling the life of thought vision and the ecstasy ofspiritual experience which made the ancient verses appear then and still makethem to those who can enter into the element in which these utterances move, arevelation not to the intellect alone, but to the soul and the whole being, makeof them in the old expressive word not intellectual thought and phrase, butsruti, spiritual audience, an inspired Scripture. The philosophical substance ofthe Upanishads demands at this day no farther stress of appreciation of itsvalue; for even if the amplest acknowledgement by the greatest minds werewanting, the whole history of philosophy would be there to offer its evidence.The Upanishads have been the acknowledged source of numerous profoundphilosophies and religions that flowed from it in India like her great riversfrom their Himalayan cradle fertilising the mind and life of the people and keptits soul alive through the long procession of the centuries, constantly returnedto for light, never failing to give fresh illumination, a fountain ofinexhaustible life-giving waters. Buddhism with all its developments was only arestatement, although from a new standpoint and with fresh terms of intellectualdefinition and reasoning, of one side of its experience and it carried it thuschanged in form but hardly in substance over all Asia and westward towardsEurope. The ideas of the Upanishads can be rediscovered in much of the thoughtof Pythagoras and Plato and form the profoundest part of Neo-platonism andGnosticism with all their considerable consequences to the philosophicalthinking of the West, and Sufism only repeats them in another religiouslanguage. The larger part of German metaphysics is little more in substance thanan intellectual development of great realities more spiritually seen in thisancient teaching, and modern thought is rapidly absorbing them with a closer,more living and intense receptiveness which promises a revolution both inphilosophical and in religious thinking; here they are filtering in through manyindirect influences, there slowly pouring through direct and open channels.There is hardly a main philosophical idea which cannot find an authority or aseed or indication in these antique writings — the speculations, according to acertain view, of thinkers who had no better past or background to their thoughtthan a crude, barbaric, naturalistic and animistic ignorance. And even thelarger generalisations of Science are constantly found to apply to the truth ofphysical Nature formulas already discovered by the Indian sages in theiroriginal, their largest meaning in the deeper truth of the spirit.And yet these works are not philosophical speculations of the intellectual kind,a metaphysical analysis which labours to define notions, to select ideas anddiscriminate those that are true, to logicise truth or else to support the mindin its intellectual preferences by dialectical reasoning and is content to putforward an exclusive solution of existence in the light of this or that idea ofthe reason and see all things from that viewpoint, in that focus and determiningperspective. The Upanishads could not have had so undying a vitality, exercisedso unfailing an influence, produced such results or seen now their affirmationsindependently justified in other spheres of inquiry and by quite oppositemethods, if they had been of that character. It is because these seers saw Truthrather than merely thought it, clothed it indeed with a strong body of intuitiveidea and disclosing image, but a body of ideal transparency through which welook into the illimitable, because they fathomed things in the light ofself-existence and saw them with the eye of the Infinite, that their wordsremain always alive and immortal, of an inexhaustible significance, aninevitable authenticity, a satisfying finality that is at the same time aninfinite commencement of truth, to which all our lines of investigation whenthey go through to their end arrive again and to which humanity constantlyreturns in its minds and its ages of greatest vision. The Upanishads areVedanta, a book of knowledge in a higher degree even than the Vedas, butknowledge in the profounder Indian sense of the word, Jnana. Not a mere thinkingand considering by the intelligence, the pursuit and grasping of a mental formof truth by the intellectual mind, but a seeing of it with the soul and a totalliving in it with the power of the inner being, a spiritual seizing by a kind ofidentification with the object of knowledge is Jnana. And because it is only byan integral knowing of the self that this kind of direct knowledge can be madecomplete, it was the self that the Vedantic sages sought to know, to live in andto be one with it by identity. And through this endeavour they came easily tosee that the self in us is one with the universal self of all things and thatthis self again is the same as God and Brahman, a transcendent Being orExistence, and they beheld, felt, lived in the inmost truth of all things in theuniverse and the inmost truth of man’s inner and outer existence by the light ofthis one and unifying vision. The Upanishads are epic hymns of self-knowledgeand world-knowledge and God-knowledge. The great formulations of philosophictruth with which they abound are not abstract intellectual generalisations,things that may shine and enlighten the mind, but do not live and move the soulto ascension, but are ardours as well as lights of an intuitive and revelatoryillumination, reachings as well as seeings of the one Existence, thetranscendent Godhead, the divine and universal Self and discoveries of hisrelation with things and creatures in this great cosmic manifestation. Chants ofinspired knowledge, they breathe like all hymns a tone of religious aspirationand ecstasy, not of the narrowly intense kind proper to a lesser religiousfeeling, but raised beyond cult and special forms of devotion to the universalAnanda of the Divine which comes to us by approach to and oneness with theself-existent and universal spirit. And though mainly concerned with an innervision and not directly with outward human action, all the highest ethics ofBuddhism and later Hinduism are still emergences of the very life andsignificance of the truths to which they give expressive form and force, — andthere is something greater than any ethical precept and mental rule of virtue,the supreme ideal of a spiritual action founded on oneness with God and allliving beings. Therefore even when the life of the forms of the Vedic cult hadpassed away, the Upanishads still remained alive and creative and could generatethe great devotional religions and motive the persistent Indian idea of theDharma.The Upanishads are the creation of a revelatory and intuitive mind and itsillumined experience, and all their substance, structure, phrase, imagery,movement are determined by and stamped with this original character. Thesesupreme and all-embracing truths, these visions of oneness and self and auniversal divine being are cast into brief and monumental phrases which bringthem at once before the soul’s eye and make them real and imperative to itsaspiration and experience or are couched in poetic sentences full of revealingpower and suggestive thought-colour that discover a whole infinite through afinite image. The One is there revealed, but also disclosed the many aspects,and each is given its whole significance by the amplitude of the expression andfinds as if in a spontaneous self-discovery its place and its connection by theillumining justness of each word and all the phrase. The largest metaphysicaltruths and the subtlest subtleties of psychological experience are taken up intothe inspired movement and made at once precise to the seeing mind and loadedwith unending suggestion to the discovering spirit. There are separate phrases,single couplets, brief passages which contain each in itself the substance of avast philosophy and yet each is only thrown out as a side, an aspect, a portionof the infinite self-knowledge. All here is a packed and pregnant and yetperfectly lucid and luminous brevity and an immeasurable completeness. A thoughtof this kind cannot follow the tardy, careful and diffuse development of thelogical intelligence. The passage, the sentence, the couplet, the line, even thehalf line follows the one that precedes with a certain interval full of anunexpressed thought, an echoing silence between them, a thought which is carriedin the total suggestion and implied in the step itself, but which the mind isleft to work out for its own profit, and these intervals of pregnant silence arelarge, the steps of this thought are like the paces of a Titan striding fromrock to distant rock across infinite waters. There is a perfect totality, acomprehensive connection of harmonious parts in the structure of each Upanishad;but it is done in the way of a mind that sees masses of truth at a time andstops to bring only the needed word out of a filled silence. The rhythm in verseor cadenced prose corresponds to the sculpture of the thought and the phrase.The metrical forms of the Upanishads are made up of four half lines each clearlycut, the lines mostly complete in themselves and integral in sense, the halflines presenting two thoughts or distinct parts of a thought that are wedded toand complete each other, and the sound movement follows a correspondingprinciple, each step brief and marked off by the distinctness of its pause, fullof echoing cadences that remain long vibrating in the inner hearing: each is asif a wave of the infinite that carries in it the whole voice and rumour of theocean. It is a kind of poetry — word of vision, rhythm of the spirit, — that hasnot been written before or after.The imagery of the Upanishads is in large part developed from the type ofimagery of the Veda and though very ordinarily it prefers an unveiled clarity ofdirectly illuminative image, not unoften also it uses the same symbols in a waythat is closely akin to the spirit and to the less technical part of the methodof the older symbolism. It is to a great extent this element no longer seizableby our way of thinking that has baffled certain Western scholars and made themcry out that these scriptures are a mixture of the sublimest philosophicalspeculations with the first awkward stammerings of the child mind of humanity.The Upanishads are not a revolutionary departure from the Vedic mind and itstemperament and fundamental ideas, but a continuation and development and to acertain extent an enlarging transformation in the sense of bringing out intoopen expression all that was held covered in the symbolic Vedic speech as amystery and a secret. It begins by taking up the imagery and the ritual symbolsof the Veda and the Brahmanas and turning them in such a way as to bring out aninner and a mystic sense which will serve as a sort of psychical starting-pointfor its own more highly evolved and more purely spiritual philosophy. There area number of passages especially in the prose Upanishads which are entirely ofthis kind and deal, in a manner recondite, obscure and even unintelligible tothe modern understanding, with the psychic sense of ideas then current in theVedic religious mind, the distinction between the three kinds of Veda, the threeworlds and other similar subjects; but, leading as they do in the thought of theUpanishads to deepest spiritual truths, these passages cannot be dismissed aschildish aberrations of the intelligence void of sense or of any discoverablebearing on the higher thought in which they culminate. On the contrary we findthat they have a deep enough significance once we can get inside their symbolicmeaning. That appears in a psycho-physical passing upward into apsycho-spiritual knowledge for which we would now use more intellectual, lessconcrete and imaged terms, but which is still valid for those who practise Yogaand rediscover the secrets of our psycho-physical and psycho-spiritual being.Typical passages of this kind of peculiar expression of psychic truths areAjatashatru’s explanation of sleep and dream or the passages of the PrasnaUpanishad on the vital principle and its motions, or those in which the Vedicidea of the struggle between the Gods and the demons is taken up and given itsspiritual significance and the Vedic godheads more openly than in Rik and Samancharacterised and invoked in their inner function and spiritual power.I may cite as an example of this development of Vedic idea and image a passageof the Taittiriya in which Indra plainly appears as the power and godhead of thedivine mind:He who is the Bull of the Vedas of the universal form, he who was born in thesacred rhythms from the Immortal, — may Indra satisfy me through theintelligence. O God, may I become a vessel of the Immortal. May my body be fullof vision and my tongue of sweetness, may I hear the much and vast with my ears.For thou art the sheath of Brahman covered over and hidden by the intelligence.And a kindred passage may also be cited from the Isha in which Surya the Sun-Godis invoked as the godhead of knowledge whose supreme form of effulgence is theoneness of the Spirit and his rays dispersed here on the mental level are theshining diffusion of the thought mind and conceal his own infinite supramentaltruth, the body and self of this Sun, the truth of the spirit and the Eternal:The face of the Truth is covered with a golden lid: O fostering Sun, thatuncover for the law of the truth, for sight. O fosterer, O sole Rishi, Ocontrolling Yama, O Surya, O son of the Father of creatures, marshal and massthy rays: the Lustre that is thy most blessed form of all, that I see, He who isthis, this Purusha, He am I.The kinship in difference of these passages with the imagery and style of theVeda is evident and the last indeed paraphrases or translates into a later andmore open style a Vedic verse of the Atris:Hidden by your truth is the Truth that is constant for ever where they unyokethe horses of the Sun. There the ten thousands stand together, That is the One:I have seen the supreme Godhead of the embodied gods.This Vedic and Vedantic imagery is foreign to our present mentality which doesnot believe in the living truth of the symbol, because the revealing imaginationintimidated by the intellect has no longer the courage to accept, identifyitself with and boldly embody a psychic and spiritual vision; but it iscertainly very far from being a childish or a primitive and barbarous mysticism;this vivid, living, luminously poetic intuitive language is rather the naturalexpression of a highly evolved spiritual culture.The intuitive thought of the Upanishads starts from this concrete imagery andthese symbols, first to the Vedic Rishis secret seer words wholly expressive tothe mind of the seer but veils of their deepest sense to the ordinaryintelligence, link them to a less covertly expressive language and pass beyondthem to another magnificently open and sublime imagery and diction which at oncereveals the spiritual truth in all its splendour. The prose Upanishads show usthis process of the early mind of India at its work using the symbol and thenpassing beyond it to the overt expression of the spiritual significance. Apassage of the Prasna Upanishad on the power and significance of the mysticsyllable AUM illustrates the earlier stage of the process:This syllable OM, O Satyakama, it is the supreme and it is the lower Brahman.Therefore the man of knowledge passeth by this house of the Brahman to the oneor the other. And if one meditate on the single letter, he getteth by itknowledge and soon he attaineth on the earth. And him the Riks lead to the worldof men and there perfected in Tapas and Brahmacharya and faith he experienceththe greatness of the spirit. Now if by the double letter he is accomplished inthe mind, then is he led up by the Yajus to the middle world, to the moon-worldof Soma. He in the world of Soma experienceth the majesty of the spirit andreturneth again. And he who by the triple letter again, even this syllable OM,shall meditate on the highest Purusha, is perfected in the light that is theSun. As a snake putteth off its skin, even so is he released from sin and eviland is led by the Samans to the world of Brahman. He from this dense of livingsouls seeth the higher than the highest Purusha who lieth in this mansion. Thethree letters are afflicted by death, but now they are used undivided and unitedto each other, then are the inner and the outer and the middle action of thespirit made whole in their perfect using and the spirit knows and is not shaken.This world by the Riks, the middle world by the Yajus and by the Samans thatwhich the seers make known to us. The man of knowledge passeth to Him by OM, hishouse, even to the supreme spirit that is calm and ageless and fearless andimmortal.The symbols here are still obscure to our intelligence, but indications aregiven which show beyond doubt that they are representations of a psychicalexperience leading to different states of spiritual realisation and we can seethat these are three, outward, mental and supramental, and as the result of thelast a supreme perfection, a complete and integral action of the whole being inthe tranquil eternity of the immortal Spirit. And later in the MandukyaUpanishad the other symbols are cast aside and we are admitted to the unveiledsignificance. Then there emerges a knowledge to which modern thought isreturning through its own very different intellectual, rational and scientificmethod, the knowledge that behind the operations of our outward physicalconsciousness are working the operations of another, subliminal, — another andyet the same, — of which our waking mind is a surface action, and above —perhaps, we still say — is a spiritual superconscience in which can be found, itmay well be, the highest state and the whole secret of our being. We shall see,when we look closely at the passage of the Prasna Upanishad, that this knowledgeis already there, and I think we can very rationally conclude that these andsimilar utterances of the ancient sages, however perplexing their form to therational mind, cannot be dismissed as a childish mysticism, but are the imagedexpression, natural to the mentality of the time, of what the reason itself byits own processes is now showing us to be true and a very profound truth andreal reality of knowledge.The metrical Upanishads continue this highly charged symbolism but carry it morelightly and in the bulk of their verses pass beyond this kind of image to theovert expression. The Self, the Spirit, the Godhead in man and creatures andNature and all this world and in other worlds and beyond all cosmos, theImmortal, the One, the Infinite is hymned without veils in the splendour of hiseternal transcendence and his manifold self-revelation. A few passages from theteachings of Yama, lord of the Law and of Death, to Nachiketas, will be enoughto illustrate something of their character.OM is this syllable. This syllable is the Brahman, this syllable is the Supreme.He who knoweth the imperishable OM, whatso he willeth, it is his. This supportis the best, this support is the highest; and when a man knoweth it, he isgreatened in the world of Brahman. The omniscient is not born, nor dies, nor hashe come into being from anywhere, nor is he anyone. He is unborn, he is constantand eternal, he is the Ancient of Days who is not slain in the slaying of thebody....He is seated and journeys far, and lying still he goes to every side. Who otherthan I should know this ecstatic Godhead? The wise man cometh to know the greatLord and Self established and bodiless in these bodies that pass and has griefno longer. This Self is not to be won by teaching nor by brain-power nor by muchlearning: he whom the Spirit chooses, by him alone it can be won, and to himthis Spirit discloses its own very body. One who has not ceased from ill-doing,one who is not concentrated and calm, one whose mind is not tranquil, shall notget him by the brain’s wisdom. He of whom warriors and sages are the food anddeath is the spice of his banquet, who knoweth where is He?...The Self-born has cloven his doors outward, therefore man sees outward and notin the inner self: only a wise man here and there turns his eyes inward,desiring immortality, and looks on the Self face to face. The child minds followafter surface desires and fall into the net of death which is spread wide forus; but the wise know of immortality and ask not from things inconstant thatwhich is constant. One knoweth by this Self form and taste and odour and touchand its pleasures and what then is here left over? The wise man cometh to knowthe great Lord and Self by whom one seeth all that is in the soul that wakes andall that is in the soul that dreams and hath grief no longer. He who knoweth theSelf, the eater of sweetness close to the living being, the lord of what was andwhat will be, shrinks thereafter from nothing that is. He knoweth him who isthat which was born of old from Tapas and who was born of old from the watersand hath entered in and standeth in the secret cavern of being with all thesecreatures. He knoweth her who is born by the life force, the infinite Motherwith all the gods in her, her who hath entered in and standeth in the secretcavern of being with all these creatures. This is the Fire that hath theknowledge and it is hidden in the two tinders as the embryo is borne in pregnantwomen; this is the Fire that must be adored by men watching sleeplessly andbringing to him the offering. He is that from which the Sun rises and that inwhich it sets: and in him all the gods are founded and none can pass beyond him.What is here, even that is in other worlds, and what is there, even according tothat is all that is here. He goes from death to death who sees here onlydifference. A Purusha no bigger than a thumb stands in man’s central self and isthe lord of what was and what shall be, and knowing him thenceforth one shrinksfrom nothing that is. A Purusha no bigger than a man’s thumb and he is like alight without smoke; he is the Lord of what was and what shall be; it is he thatis today and it is he that shall be tomorrow.The Upanishads abound with passages which are at once poetry and spiritualphilosophy, of an absolute clarity and beauty, but no translation empty of thesuggestions and the grave and subtle and luminous sense echoes of the originalwords and rhythms can give any idea of their power and perfection. There areothers in which the subtlest psychological and philosophical truths areexpressed with an entire sufficiency without falling short of a perfect beautyof poetical expression and always so as to live to the mind and soul and notmerely be presented to the understanding intelligence. There is in some of theprose Upanishads another element of vivid narrative and tradition which restoresfor us though only in brief glimpses the picture of that extraordinary stir andmovement of spiritual enquiry and passion for the highest knowledge which madethe Upanishads possible. The scenes of the old world live before us in a fewpages, the sages sitting in their groves ready to test and teach the comer,princes and learned Brahmins and great landed nobles going about in search ofknowledge, the king’s son in his chariot and the illegitimate son of theservant-girl, seeking any man who might carry in himself the thought of lightand the word of revelation, the typical figures and personalities, Janaka andthe subtle mind of Ajatashatru, Raikwa of the cart, Yajnavalkya militant fortruth, calm and ironic, taking to himself with both hands without attachmentworldly possessions and spiritual riches and casting at last all his wealthbehind to wander forth as a houseless ascetic, Krishna son of Devaki who heard asingle word of the Rishi Ghora and knew at once the Eternal, the ashramas, thecourts of kings who were also spiritual discoverers and thinkers, the greatsacrificial assemblies where the sages met and compared their knowledge. And wesee how the soul of India was born and how arose this great birth-song in whichit soared from its earth into the supreme empyrean of the spirit. The Vedas andthe Upanishads are not only the sufficient fountain-head of Indian philosophyand religion, but of all Indian art, poetry and literature. It was the soul, thetemperament, the ideal mind formed and expressed in them which later carved outthe great philosophies, built the structure of the Dharma, recorded its heroicyouth in the Mahabharata and Ramayana, intellectualised indefatigably in theclassical times of the ripeness of its manhood, threw out so many originalintuitions in science, created so rich a glow of aesthetic and vital andsensuous experience, renewed its spiritual and psychic experience in Tantra andPurana, flung itself into grandeur and beauty of line and colour, hewed and castits thought and vision in stone and bronze, poured itself into new channels ofself-expression in the later tongues and now after eclipse reemerges always thesame in difference and ready for a new life and a new creation."},{"pageContent":" ISHA UPANISHAD"},{"pageContent":"ISHA UPANISHAD īśā vāsyamidaḿ sarvaṁ yat kiñca jagatyāṁ jagat ǀtena tyaktena bhuñjīthā mā gṛdhaḥ kasya sviddhanam ǁ1.

[14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] There are three possible senses of vasyam, \"to be clothed\", \"to be worn as agarment\" and \"to be inhabited\". The first is the ordinarily accepted meaning.Shankara explains it in this significance, that we must lose the sense of thisunreal objective universe in the sole perception of the pure Brahman. Soexplained the first line becomes a contradiction of the whole thought of theUpanishad which teaches the reconciliation, by the perception of essentialUnity, of the apparently incompatible opposites. God and the World, Renunciationand Enjoyment, Action and internal Freedom, the One and the Many, Being and itsBecomings, the passive divine Impersonality and the active divine Personality,the Knowledge and the Ignorance, the Becoming and the Not-Becoming, Life onearth and beyond and the supreme Immortality. The image is of the world eitheras a garment or as a dwelling-place for the informing and governing Spirit. Thelatter significance agrees better with the thought of the Upanishad.[2] Kurvanneva. The stress of the word eva gives the force, \"doing works indeed,and not refraining from them\".[3] Shankara reads the line, \"Thus in thee — it is not otherwise than thus —action cleaves not to a man.\" He interprets karmani in the first line in thesense of Vedic sacrifices which are permitted to the ignorant as a means ofescaping from evil actions and their results and attaining to heaven, but thesecond karma in exactly the opposite sense, \"evil action\". The verse, he tellsus, represents a concession to the ignorant; the enlightened soul abandons worksand the world and goes to the forest. The whole expression and construction inthis rendering become forced and unnatural. The rendering I give seems to me thesimple and straightforward sense of the Upanishad.[4] We have two readings, asūryāh. sunless, and asuryāh, Titanic or undivine.The third verse is, in the thought structure of the Upanishad, thestarting-point for the final movement in the last four verses. Its suggestionsare there taken up and worked out. The prayer to the Sun refers back in thoughtto the sunless worlds and their blind gloom, which are recalled in the ninth andtwelfth verses. The sun and his rays are intimately connected in otherUpanishads also with the worlds of Light and their natural opposite is the darkand sunless, not the Titanic worlds.[5] Mātariśvan seems to mean \"he who extends himself in the Mother or thecontainer\" whether that be the containing mother element, Ether, or the materialenergy called Earth in the Veda and spoken of there as the Mother. It is a Vedicepithet of the God Vayu, who, representing the divine principle in theLife-energy, Prana, extends himself in Matter and vivifies its forms. Here itsignifies the divine Life-power that presides in all forms of cosmic activity.[6] Apas, as it is accentuated in the version of the White Yajurveda, can meanonly \"waters\". If this accentuation is disregarded, we may take it as thesingular apas, work, action. Shankara, however, renders it by the plural, works.The difficulty only arises because the true Vedic sense of the word had beenforgotten and it came to be taken as referring to the fourth of the fiveelemental states of Matter, the liquid. Such a reference would be entirelyirrelevant to the context. But the Waters, otherwise called the seven streams orthe seven fostering Cows, are the Vedic symbol for the seven cosmic principlesand their activities, three inferior, the physical, vital and mental, foursuperior, the divine Truth, the divine Bliss, and divine Will and Consciousness,and the divine Being. On this conception also is founded the ancient idea of theseven worlds in each of which the seven principles are separately active bytheir various harmonies. This is, obviously, the right significance of the wordin the Upanishad.[7] The words sarvāṇi bhūtāni literally, \"all things that have become\", isopposed to Atman, self-existent and immutable being. The phrase means ordinarily\"all creatures\", but its literal sense is evidently insisted on in theexpression bhūtāni abhūt \"became the Becomings\". The idea is the acquisition inman of the supreme consciousness by which the one Self in him extends itself toembrace all creatures and realises the eternal act by which that One manifestsitself in the multiple forms of the universal motion.[8] There is a clear distinction in Vedic thought between kavi, the seer andmanīṣī, the thinker. The former indicates the divine supra-intellectualKnowledge which by direct vision and illumination sees the reality, theprinciples and the forms of things in their true relations, the latter, thelabouring mentality, which works from the divided consciousness through thepossibilities of things downward to the actual manifestation in form and upwardto their reality in the self-existent Brahman.[9] Anyadeva — eva here gives to anyad the force, \"Quite other than the resultdescribed in the preceding verse is that to which lead the Knowledge and theIgnorance.\" We have the explanation of anyad in the verse that follows. Theordinary rendering, \"Knowledge has one result. Ignorance another\", would be anobvious commonplace announced with an exaggerated pompousness, adding nothing tothe thought and without any place in the sequence of the ideas.[10] In the inner sense of the Veda Surya, the Sun-God, represents the divineIllumination of the Kavi which exceeds mind and forms the pure self-luminousTruth of things. His principal power is self-revelatory knowledge, termed in theVeda, \"Sight\". His realm is described as the Truth, the Law, the Vast. He is theFosterer or Increaser, for he enlarges and opens man's dark and limited beinginto a luminous and infinite consciousness. He is the sole Seer, Seer of Onenessand Knower of the Self, and leads him to the highest Sight. He is Yama,Controller or Ordainer for he governs man's action and manifested being by thedirect Law of the Truth, satya-dharma, and therefore by the right principle ofour nature, yāthā-tathyatah, a luminous power proceeding from the Father of allexistence, he reveals in himself the divine Purusha of whom all beings are themanifestations. His rays are the thoughts that proceed luminously from theTruth, the Vast, but become deflected and distorted, broken up and disordered inthe reflecting and dividing principle. Mind. They form there the golden lidwhich covers the face of the Truth. The Seer prays to Surya to cast them intoright order and relation and then draw them together into the unity of revealedtruth. The result of this inner process is the perception of the oneness of allbeings in the divine Soul of the Universe.[11] Vayu, called elsewhere Matarishwan, the Life-Energy in the universe. In thelight of Surya he reveals himself as an immortal principle of existence of whichbirth and death and life in the body are only particular and external processes.[12] The Vedic term kratu means sometimes the action itself, sometimes theeffective power behind action represented in mental consciousness by the will.Agni is this power. He is divine force which manifests first in matter as heatand light and material energy and then, taking different forms in the otherprinciples of man's consciousness, leads him by a progressive manifestationupwards to the Truth and the Bliss.[13] Sin, in the conception of the Veda, from which this verse is taken bodily,is that which excites and hurries the faculties into deviation from the goodpath. There is a straight road or road of naturally increasing light and truth,rjuḥ panthāh, ṛtasya panthāḥ, leading over infinite levels and towards infinitevistas, vitā p̣rṣṭhā, by which the law of our nature should normally take ustowards our fulfilment. Sin compels it instead to travel with stumblings amiduneven and limited tracts and along crooked windings (duritāni, vṛjināni).[14] The word vidhema is used of the ordering of the sacrifice, the disposal ofthe offerings to the God and, generally, of the sacrifice or worship itself. TheVedic namas, internal and external obeisance, is the symbol of submission to thedivine Being in ourselves and in the world. Here the offering is that ofcompletest submission and the self-surrender of all the faculties of the loweregoistic human nature to the divine Will-force, Agni, so that, free frominternal opposition, it may lead the soul of man through the truth towards afelicity full of the spiritual riches, rāye. That state of beatitude is theintended self-content in the principle of pure Love and Joy, which the Vedicinitiates regarded as the source of the divine existence in the universe and thefoundation of the divine life in the human being. It is the deformation of thisprinciple by egoism which appears as desire and the lust of possession in thelower worlds."},{"pageContent":"ANALYSISPREFATORYPLAN OF THE UPANISHADTHE Upanishads, being vehicles of illumination and not of instruction, composedfor seekers who had already a general familiarity with the ideas of the Vedicand Vedantic seers and even some personal experience of the truths on which theywere founded, dispense in their style with expressed transitions of thought andthe development of implied or subordinate notions.Every verse in the Isha Upanishad reposes on a number of ideas implicit in thetext but nowhere set forth explicitly; the reasoning also that supports itsconclusions is suggested by the words, not expressly conveyed to theintelligence. The reader, or rather the hearer, was supposed to proceed fromlight to light, confirming his intuitions and verifying by his experience, notsubmitting the ideas to the judgment of the logical reason.To the modern mind this method is invalid and inapplicable; it is necessary topresent the ideas of the Upanishad in their completeness, underline thesuggestions, supply the necessary transitions and bring out the suppressed butalways implicit reasoning.The central idea of the Upanishad, which is a reconciliation and harmony offundamental opposites, is worked out sym­metrically in four successive movementsof thought. FIRST MOVEMENTIn the first, a basis is laid down by the idea of the one and stable Spiritinhabiting and governing a universe of movement and of the forms of movement.(Verse 1, line 1)On this conception the rule of a divine life for man is founded, — enjoyment ofall by renunciation of all through the exclusion of desire. (Verse 1, line 2)There is then declared the justification of works and of the physical life onthe basis of an inalienable freedom of the soul, one with the Lord, amidst allthe activity of the multiple movement. (Verse 2)Finally, the result of an ignorant interference with the right manifestation ofthe One in the multiplicity is declared to be an involution in states of blindobscurity after death. (Verse 3) SECOND MOVEMENTIn the second movement the ideas of the first verse are resumed and amplified.The one stable Lord and the multiple movement are identified as one Brahman ofwhom, however, the unity and stability are the higher truth and who contains allas well as inhabits all. (Verses 4,5)The basis and fulfilment of the rule of life are found in the experience ofunity by which man identifies himself with the cosmic and transcendental Selfand is identified in the Self, but with an entire freedom from grief andillusion, with all its becomings. (Verses 6,7) THIRD MOVEMENTIn the third movement there is a return to the justification of life and works(the subject of Verse 2) and an indication of their divine fulfilment.The degrees of the Lord's self-manifestation in the universe of motion and inthe becomings of the one Being are set forth and the inner law of all existencesdeclared to be by His conception and determination. (Verse 8)Vidya and Avidya, Becoming and Non-becoming are reconciled by their mutualutility to the progressive self-realisation which proceeds from the state ofmortality to the state of Immortality. (Verses 9-14) FOURTH MOVEMENTThe fourth movement returns to the idea of the worlds and under the figures ofSurya and Agni the relations of the Supreme Truth and Immortality (Verses15,16), the activities of this life (Verse 17), and the state after death (Verse18) are symbolically indicated."},{"pageContent":"FIRST MOVEMENTTHE INHABITING GODHEAD:LIFE AND ACTIONVerses 1 - 3[1]THE BASIS OF COSMIC EXISTENCEGod and the world. Spirit and formative Nature are confronted and theirrelations fixed. COSMOSAll world is a movement of the Spirit in itself and is mutable and transient inall its formations and appearances; its only eternity is an eternity ofrecurrence, its only stability a semblance caused by certain apparent fixitiesof relation and grouping.Every separate object in the universe is, in truth, itself the whole universepresenting a certain front or outward appearance of its movement. The microcosmis one with the macrocosm.Yet in their relation of principle of movement and result of movement they arecontinent and contained, world in world, movement in movement. The individualtherefore partakes of the nature of the universal, refers back to it for itssource of activity, is, as we say, subject to its laws and part of cosmicNature. SPIRITSpirit is lord of its movement, one, immutable, free, stable and eternal.The Movement with all its formed objects has been created in order to provide ahabitation for the Spirit who, being One, yet dwells multitudinously in themultiplicity of His mansions.It is the same Lord who dwells in the sum and the part, in the Cosmos as a wholeand in each being, force or object in the Cosmos.Since He is one and indivisible, the Spirit in all is one and their multiplicityis a play of His cosmic consciousness.Therefore each human being is in his essence one with all others, free, eternal,immutable, lord of Nature. TRANSITIONAL THOUGHTAVIDYAThe object of habitation is enjoyment and possession; the object of the Spiritin Cosmos is, therefore, the possession and enjoyment of the universe. Yet,being thus in his essence one, divine and free, man seems to be limited, dividedfrom others, subject to Nature and even its creation and sport, enslaved todeath, ignorance and sorrow. His object in manifestation being possession andenjoyment of his world, he is unable to enjoy because of his limitation. Thiscontrary result comes about by Avidya, the Ignorance of oneness: and the knot ofthe Ignorance is egoism. EGOThe cause of ego is that while by Its double power of Vidya and Avidya theSpirit dwells at once in the consciousness of multiplicity and relativity and inthe consciousness of unity and identity and is therefore not bound by theIgnorance, yet It can, in mind, identify Itself with the object in the movement,absorbingly, to the apparent exclusion of the Knowledge which remains behind,veiled at the back of the mentality. The movement of Mind in Nature is thus ableto conceive of the object as the reality and the Inhabitant as limited anddetermined by the appearances of the object. It conceives of the object, not asthe universe in one of its frontal appearances, but as itself a separateexistence standing out from the Cosmos and different in being from all the restof it. It conceives similarly of the Inhabitant. This is the illusion ofignorance which falsifies all realities. The illusion is called ahamkāra, theseparative ego-sense which makes each being conceive of itself as an independentpersonality.The result of the separation is the inability to enter into harmony and onenesswith the universe and a consequent in-ability to possess and enjoy it. But thedesire to possess and enjoy is the master impulse of the Ego which knows itselfobscurely to be the Lord, although owing to the limitations of its relativity,it is unable to realise its true existence. The result is discord with othersand oneself, mental and physical suffering, the sense of weakness and inability,the sense of obscuration, the straining of energy in passion and in desiretowards self-fulfilment, the recoil of energy exhausted or disappointed towardsdeath and disintegration.Desire is the badge of subjection with its attendant discord and suffering. Thatwhich is free, one and lord, does not desire, but inalienably contains,possesses and enjoys. THE RULE OF THE DIVINE LIFEEnjoyment of the universe and all it contains is the object of world-existence,but renunciation of all in desire is the condition of the free enjoyment of all.The renunciation demanded is not a moral constraint of self-denial or a physicalrejection, but an entire liberation of the spirit from any craving after theforms of things.The terms of this liberation are freedom from egoism and, consequently, freedomfrom personal desire. Practically, this renunciation implies that one should notregard anything in the universe as a necessary object of possession, nor aspossessed by another and not by oneself, nor as an object of greed in the heartor the senses.This attitude is founded on the perception of unity. For it has already beensaid that all souls are one possessing Self, the Lord; and although the Lordinhabits each object as if separately, yet all objects exist in that Self andnot outside it.Therefore by transcending Ego and realising the one Self, we possess the wholeuniverse in the one cosmic consciousness and do not need to possess physically.Having by oneness with the Lord the possibility of an infinite free delight inall things, we do not need to desire.Being one with all beings, we possess, in their enjoyment, in ours and in thecosmic Being's, delight of universal self-expression. It is only by this Anandaat once transcendent and universal that man can be free in his soul and yet livein the world with the full active Life of the Lord in His universe of movement. THE JUSTIFICATION OF WORKSThis freedom does not depend upon inaction, nor is this possession limited tothe enjoyment of the inactive Soul that only witnesses without taking part inthe movement. On the contrary, the doing of works in this material world and afull acceptance of the term of physical life are part of its completeness. Forthe active Brahman fulfils Itself in the world by works and man also is in thebody for self-fulfilment by action. He cannot do otherwise, for even his inertiaacts and produces effects in the cosmic movement. Being in this body or any kindof body, it is idle to think of refraining from action or escaping the physicallife. The idea that this in itself can be a means of liberation, is part of theIgnorance which supposes the soul to be a separate entity in the Brahman.Action is shunned because it is thought to be inconsistent with freedom. The manwhen he acts, is supposed to be necessarily entangled in the desire behind theaction, in subjection to the formal energy that drives the action and in theresults of the action. These things are true in appearance, not in reality.Desire is only a mode of the emotional mind which by ignorance seeks its delightin the object of desire and not in the Brahman who expresses Himself in theobject. By destroying that ignorance one can do action without entanglement indesire.The Energy that drives is itself subject to the Lord, who expresses Himself init with perfect freedom. By getting behind Nature to the Lord of Nature, mergingthe individual in the Cosmic Will, one can act with the divine freedom. Ouractions are given up to the Lord and our personal responsibility ceases in Hisliberty.The chain of Karma only binds the movement of Nature and not the soul which, byknowing itself, ceases even to appear to be bound by the result of its works.Therefore the way of freedom is not inaction, but to cease from identifyingoneself with the movement and recover instead our true identity in the Self ofthings who is their Lord. THE OTHER WORLDSBy departing from the physical life one does not disappear out of the Movement,but only passes into some other general state of consciousness than the materialuniverse.These states are either obscure or illuminated, some dark or sunless.By persisting in gross forms of ignorance, by coercing perversely the soul inits self-fulfilment or by a wrong dissolution of its becoming in the Movement,one enters into states of blind darkness, not into the worlds of light and ofliberated and blissful being.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 1 All this is for habitation by the Lord, whatsoever is individual universeof movement in the universal motion. By that renounced thou shouldst enjoy; lustnot after any man's possession.2 Doing verily works in this world one should wish to live a hundred years. Thusit is in thee and not otherwise than this; action cleaves not to a man.3 Sunless are those worlds and enveloped in blind gloom whereto all they intheir passing hence resort who are slayers of their souls."},{"pageContent":"SECOND MOVEMENT1. BRAHMAN:ONENESS OF GOD AND THE WORLDVerses 4 - 5[1]BRAHMAN — THE UNITYThe Lord and the world, even when they seem to be distinct, are not reallydifferent from each other; they are one Brahman. \"ONE UNMOVING\"God is the one stable and eternal Reality. He is One because there is nothingelse, since all existence and non-existence are He. He is stable or unmoving,because motion implies change in Space and change in Time, and He, being beyondTime and Space, is immutable. He possesses eternally in Himself all that is, hasbeen or ever can be, and He therefore does not increase or diminish. He isbeyond causality and relativity and therefore there is no change of relations inHis being. \"SWIFTER THAN MIND\"The world is a cyclic movement (samsāra) of the Divine Consciousness in Spaceand Time. Its law and, in a sense, its object is progression; it exists bymovement and would be dissolved by cessation of movement. But the basis of thismovement is not material; it is the energy of active consciousness which, by itsmotion and multiplication in different principles (different in appearance, thesame in essence), creates oppositions of unity and multiplicity, divisions ofTime and Space, relations and groupings of circumstance and Causality. All thesethings are real in consciousness, but only symbolic of the Being, somewhat asthe imaginations of a creative Mind are true representations of itself, yet notquite real in comparison with itself, or real with a different kind of reality.But mental consciousness is not the Power that creates the universe. That issomething infinitely more puissant, swift and unfettered than the mind. It isthe pure omnipotent self-awareness of the Absolute unbound by any law of therelativity. The laws of the relativity, upheld by the gods, are Its temporarycreations. Their apparent eternity is only the duration, immeasurable to us, ofthe world which they govern. They are laws regularising motion and change, notlaws binding the Lord of the movement. The gods, therefore, are described ascontinually running in their course. But the Lord is free and unaffected by Hisown movement. \"THAT MOVES, THAT MOVES NOT\"The motion of the world works under the government of a perpetual stability.Change represents the constant shifting of apparent relations in an eternalImmutability.It is these truths that are expressed in the formulae of the one Unmoving thatis swifter than Mind, That which moves and moves not, the one Stable whichoutstrips in the speed of its effective consciousness the others who run. TRANSITIONAL THOUGHTTHE MANY[2]If the One is pre-eminently real, \"the others9', the Many are not unreal. Theworld is not a figment of the Mind.Unity is the eternal truth of things, diversity a play of the unity. The senseof unity has therefore been termed Knowledge, Vidya, the sense of diversityIgnorance, Avidya. But diversity is not false except when it is divorced fromthe sense of its true and eternal unity.Brahman is one, not numerically, but in essence. Numerical oneness would eitherexclude multiplicity or would be a pluralistic and divisible oneness with theMany as its parts. That is not the unity of Brahman, which can neither bediminished nor increased, nor divided.The Many in the universe are sometimes called parts of the universal Brahman asthe waves are parts of the sea. But, in truth, these waves are each of them thatsea, their diversities being those of frontal or superficial appearances causedby the sea's motion. As each object in the universe is really the whole universein a different frontal appearance, so each individual soul is all Brahmanregarding Itself and world from a centre of cosmic consciousness.For That is identical, not single. It is identical always and everywhere in Timeand Space, as well as identical beyond Time and Space. Numerical oneness andmultiplicity are equally valid terms of its essential unity.These two terms, as we see them, are like all others, representations in Chit,in the free and all-creative self-awareness of the Absolute regarding itselfvariously, infinitely, innumerably and formulating what it regards. Chit is apower not only of knowledge, but of expressive will, not only of receptivevision, but of formative representation; the two are indeed one power. For Chitis an action of Being, not of the Void. What it sees, that becomes. It seesitself beyond Space and Time; that becomes in the conditions of Space and Time.Creation is not a making of something out of nothing or of one thing out ofanother, but a self-projection of Brahman into the conditions of Space and time.Creation is not a making, but a becoming in terms and forms of consciousexistence.In the becoming each individual is Brahman variously represented and enteringinto various relations with Itself in the play of the divine consciousness; inbeing, each individual is all Brahman.Brahman as the Absolute or the Universal has the power of standing back fromItself in the relativity. It conceives, by a subordinate movement ofconsciousness, the individual as other than the universal, the relative asdifferent from the Absolute. Without this separative movement, the individualwould always tend to lose itself in the universal, the relative to disappearinto the Absolute. Thus, It supports a corresponding reaction in the individualwho regards himself as \"other\" than the transcendent and universal Brahman and\"other\" than the rest of the Many. He puts identity behind him and enforces theplay of Being in the separate Ego.The individual may regard himself as eternally different from the One, or aseternally one with It, yet different, or he may go back entirely in hisconsciousness to the pure Identity. [3] But he can never regard himself asindependent of some kind of Unity, for such a view would correspond to noconceivable truth in the universe or beyond it.These three attitudes correspond to three truths of the Brahman which aresimultaneously valid and none of them entirely true without the others as itscomplements. Their co-existence, difficult of conception to the logicalintellect, can be experienced by identity in consciousness with Brahman.Even in asserting Oneness, we must remember that Brahman is beyond our mentaldistinctions and is a fact not of Thought that discriminates, but of Being whichis absolute, infinite and escapes discrimination. Our consciousness isrepresentative and symbolic; it cannot conceive the thing-in-itself, theAbsolute, except by negation, in a sort of void, by emptying it of all that itseems in the universe to contain. But the Absolute is not a void or negation. Itis all that is here in Time and beyond Time.Even oneness is a representation and exists in relation to multiplicity. Vidyaand Avidya are equally eternal powers of the supreme Chit. Neither Vidya norAvidya by itself is the absolute knowledge. (Verses 9-11)Still, of all relations oneness is the secret base, not multiplicity. Onenessconstitutes and upholds the multiplicity, multiplicity does not constitute anduphold the oneness.Therefore we have to conceive of oneness as our self and the essential nature ofBeing, multiplicity as a representation of Self and a becoming. We have toconceive of the Brahman as One Self of all and then return upon the Many asbecomings of the One Being (bhūtāni…ātmānam). But both the Self and thebe-comings are Brahman; we cannot regard the one as Brahman and the others asunreal and not Brahman. Both are real, the one with a constituent andcomprehensive, the others with a derivative or dependent reality. THE RUNNING OF THE GODSBrahman representing Itself in the universe as the Stable. , by Its immutableexistence (Sat), is Purusha, God, Spirit; representing Itself as the Motional,by Its power of active Consciousness (Chit), is Nature, Force or World-Principle(Prakriti, Shakti, Maya). [4] The play of these two principles is the Life ofthe universe.The Gods are Brahman representing Itself in cosmic Personalities expressive ofthe one Godhead who, in their impersonal action, appear as the various play ofthe principles of Nature.The \"others\" are sarvāṇi bhūtāni of a later verse, all becomings Brahmanrepresenting itself in the separative consciousness of the Many.Everything in the universe, even the Gods, seems to itself to be moving in thegeneral movement towards a goal outside itself or other than its immediate ideaof itself. Brahman is the goal; for it is both the beginning and the end, thecause and the result of all movement.But the idea of a final goal in the movement of Nature itself is illusory. ForBrahman is Absolute and Infinite. The Gods, labouring to reach him, find, atevery goal that they realise, Brahman still moving forward in front to a fartherrealisation. Nothing in the appearances of the universe can be entirely That tothe relative consciousness; all is only a symbolic representation of theUnknowable.All things are already realised in Brahman. The running of the Others in thecourse of Nature is only a working out (Prakriti), by Causality, in Time andSpace, of something that Brahman already possesses.Even in Its universal being Brahman exceeds the Movement. Exceeding Time, Itcontains in Itself past, present and future simultaneously and has not to run tothe end of conceivable Time. Exceeding Space, It contains all formations inItself coincidently and has not to run to the end of conceivable Space.Exceeding Causality, It contains freely in Itself all eventualities as well asall potentialities without being bound by the apparent chain of causality bywhich they are linked in the universe. Everything is already realised by It asthe Lord before it can be accomplished by the separated Personalities in themovement. THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFEMATARISHWAN AND THE WATERSWhat then is Its intention in the movement?The movement is a rhythm, a harmony which That, as the Universal Life, works outby figures of Itself in the terms of conscious Being. It is a formulasymbolically expressive of the Unknowable, — so arranged that every level ofconsciousness really represents something beyond itself, depth of depth,continent of continent. It is a play[5] of the divine Consciousness existing forits own satisfaction and adding nothing to That, which is already complete. Itis a fact of conscious being, justified by its own existence, with no purposeulterior to itself. The idea of purpose, of a goal is born of the progressiveself-unfolding by the world of its own true nature to the individual Soulsinhabiting its forms; for the Being is gradually self-revealed within its ownbecomings, real Unity emerges out of the Multiplicity and changes entirely thevalues of the latter to our consciousness.This self-unfolding is governed by conditions determined by the complexity ofconsciousness in its cosmic action.For consciousness is not simple or homogeneous, it is septuple. That is to say,it constitutes itself into seven forms or grades of conscious activitydescending from pure Being to physical being. Their interplay creates theworlds, determines all activities, constitutes all becomings.Brahman is always the continent of this play or this working. Brahmanself-extended in Space and Time is the universe.In this extension Brahman represents Itself as formative Nature, the universalMother of things, who appears to us, first, as Matter, called pṛthivī, theEarth-Principle.Brahman in Matter or physical being represents Itself as the universalLife-Power, Matarishwan, which moves there as a dynamic energy, prāṇa, andpresides effectively over all arrangement and formation.Universal Life establishes, involved in Matter, the septuple consciousness; andthe action of prāṇa, the dynamic energy, on the Matrix of things evolves out ofit its different forms and serves as a basis for all their evolutions. TRANSITIONAL THOUGHTTHE WATERSThere are, then, seven constituents of Chit active in the universe.We are habitually aware of three elements in our being, Mind, Life and Body.These constitute for us a divided and mutable existence which is in a conditionof unstable harmony and works by a strife of positive and negative forcesbetween the two poles of Birth and Death. For all life is a constant birth orbecoming (sambhava, sambhūti of Verses 12-14). All birth entails a constantdeath or dissolution of that which becomes, in order that it may change into anew becoming. Therefore this state of existence is called mṛtyu. Death, anddescribed as a stage which has to be passed through and transcended. (Verses11-14)For this is not the whole of our being and, therefore, not our pure being. Wehave, behind, a superconscious existence which has also three constituents, sat,cit-tapas and ānanda.Sat is essence of our being, pure infinite and undivided, as opposed to thisdivisible being which founds itself on the constant changeableness of physicalsubstance. Sat is the divine counterpart of physical substance.Chit-Tapas is pure energy of Consciousness, free in its rest or its action,sovereign in its will, as opposed to the hampered dynamic energies of Pranawhich, feeding upon physical substances, are dependent on and limited by theirsustenance. [6] Tapas is the divine counterpart of this lower nervous or vitalenergy.Ananda is Beatitude, the bliss of pure conscious existence and energy, asopposed to the life of the sensations and emotions which are at the mercy of theoutward touches of Life and Matter and their positive and negative reactions,joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Ananda is the divine counterpart of the loweremotional and sensational being.This higher existence, proper to the divine Sachchidananda, is unified,self-existent, not confused by the figures of Birth and Death. It is called,therefore, amṛtam. Immortality, and offered to us as the goal to be aimed at andthe felicity to be enjoyed when we have transcended the state of death. (Verses11, 14, 17,18)The higher divine is linked to the lower mortal existence by the causal Idea[7]or supramental Knowledge-Will, vijñāna. It is the causal Idea which, bysupporting and secretly guiding the confused activities of the Mind, Life andBody, ensures and compels the right arrangement of the universe. It is called inthe Veda the Truth because it represents by direct vision the truth of thingsboth inclusive and independent of their appearances; the Right or Law because,containing in itself the effective power of Chit, it works out all thingsaccording to their nature with a perfect knowledge and prevision; the Vast,because it is of the nature of an infinite cosmic Intelligence comprehensive ofall particular activities.Vijnana, as the Truth, leads the divided consciousness back to the One. It alsosees the truth of things in the multiplicity. Vijnana is the divine counterpartof the lower divided intelligence.These seven powers of Chit are spoken of by the Vedic Rishis as the Waters, theyare imaged as currents flowing into or rising out of the general sea ofConsciousness in the human being. [8]They are all co-existent in the universe eternally and inseparably, but capableof being involved and remanifested in each other. They are actually involved inphysical Nature and must necessarily evolve out of it. They can be withdrawninto pure infinite Being and can again be manifested out of it.The infolding and unfolding of the One in the Many and the Many in the One istherefore the law of the eternally recurrent cosmic Cycles. THE VISION OF THE BRAHMANThe Upanishad teaches us how to perceive Brahman in the universe and in ourself-existence.We have to perceive Brahman comprehensively as both the Stable and the Moving.We must see It in eternal and immutable Spirit and in all the changingmanifestations of universe and relativity.We have to perceive all things in Space and Time, the far and the near, theimmemorial Past, the immediate Present, the infinite Future with all theircontents and happenings as the One Brahman.We have to perceive Brahman as that which exceeds, contains and supports allindividual things as well as all universe, transcendentally of Time and Spaceand Causality. We have to perceive It also as that which lives in and possessesthe universe and all it contains.This is the transcendental, universal and individual Brahman, Lord, Continentand Indwelling Spirit, which is the object of all knowledge. Its realisation isthe condition of perfection and the way of Immortality.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 4 One unmoving that is swifter than Mind; That the Gods reach not, for Itprogresses ever in front. That, standing, passes beyond others as they run. InThat the Master of Life establishes the Waters.5 That moves and That moves not; That is far and the same is near; That iswithin all this and That also is outside all this.[2] The series of ideas under this heading seem to me to be the indispensablemetaphysical basis of the Upanishad. The Isha Upanishad does not teach a pureand exclusive Monism; it declares the One without denying the Many and itsmethod is to see the One in the Many. It asserts the simultaneous validity ofVidya and Avidya and upholds as the object of action and knowledge animmortality consistent with Life and Birth in this world. It regards everyobject as itself, the universe and every soul as itself, the divine Purusha. Theensemble of these ideas is consistent only with a synthetic or comprehensive asopposed to an illusionist or exclusive Monism.[3] The positions, in inverse order, of the three principal philosophicalschools of Vedanta, Monism, Qualified Monism and Dualism.[4] Prakriti, executive Nature as opposed to Purusha, which is the Soulgoverning, taking cognisance of and enjoying the works of Prakriti. Shakti, theself-existent, self-cognitive, self-effective Power of the Lord (Ishwara, Devaor Purusha), which expresses itself in the workings of Prakriti. Maya,signifying originally in the Veda comprehensive and creative knowledge. Wisdomthat is from of old; afterwards taken in its second and derivative sense,cunning, magic. Illusion. In this second significance it can really beappropriate only to the workings of the lower Nature, aparā prakṛti which hasput behind it the Divine Wisdom and is absorbed in the experiences of theseparative Ego. It is in the more ancient sense that the word Maya is used inthe Upanishads, where, indeed, it occurs but rarely.[5] This is the Vaishnava image of the Lila applied usually to the play of thePersonal Deity in the world, but equally applicable to the active impersonalBrahman.[6] Therefore physical substance is called in the Upanishads annam. Food. In itsorigin, however, the word meant simply being or substance.[7] Not the abstract mental idea, but the supramental Real-Idea, theConsciousness, Force and Delight of the Being precipitated into a comprehensiveand discriminative awareness of all the truths and powers of its own existence,carrying in its self-knowledge the will of self-manifestation, the power of allits potentialities and the power of all its forms. It is power that acts andeffectuates, as well as knowledge master of its own action.[8] Hṛdya samudra, Ocean of the Heart. Rv. IV. 58. 5."},{"pageContent":"SECOND MOVEMENT2. SELF-REALISATIONVerses 6 - 7[1]SELF-REALISATIONBrahman is, subjectively, Atman, the Self or immutable existence of all that isin the universe. Everything that changes inus, mind, life body, character,temperament, action, is not our real and unchanging self, but becomings of theSelf in the movement, jagati.In Nature, therefore, all things that exist, animate or inanimate, are becomingsof the one Self of all. All these different creatures are one indivisibleexistence. This is the truth each being has to realise.When this unity has been realised by the individual in every part of hi3 being,he becomes perfect, pure, liberated from ego and the dualities, possessed of theentire divine felicity. ATMANAtman, our true self, is Brahman; it is pure indivisible Being, self-luminous,self-concentrated in consciousness, self-concentrated in force, self-delighted.Its existence is light and bliss. It is timeless, spaceless and free. THE THREEFOLD PURUSHA[2]Atman represents itself to the consciousness of the creature in three states,dependent on the relations between puruṣa and prakṛti, the Soul and Nature.These three states are akṣara, unmoving or immutable; kṣara, moving or mutable;and para or uttama. Supreme or Highest.Kshara Purusha is the Self reflecting the changes and movements of Nature,participating in them, immersed in the consciousness of the movement and seemingin it to be born and die, increase and diminish, progress and change. Atman, asthe Kshara, enjoys change and division and duality; controls secretly its ownchanges but seems to be controlled by them; enjoys the oppositions of pleasureand pain, good and bad, but appears to be their victim; possesses and upholdsthe action of Nature, by which it seems to be created. For, always andinalienably, the Self is Ishwara, the Lord.Akshara Purusha is the Self, standing back from the changes and movements ofNature, calm, pure, impartial, indifferent, watching them and not participating,above them as on a summit, not immersed in these Waters. This calm Self is thesky that never moves and changes looking down upon the waters that are never atrest. The Akshara is the hidden freedom of the Kshara.Para Purusha or Purushottama is the Self containing and enjoying both thestillness and the movement, but conditioned and limited by neither of them. Itis the Lord, Brahman, the All, the Indefinable and Unknowable.It is this supreme Self that has to be realised in both the unmoving and themutable. PURUSHA IN PRAKRITI[3]Atman, the Self, represents itself differently in the sevenfold movement ofNature according to the dominant principle of the consciousness in theindividual being.In the physical consciousness Atman becomes the material being, annamaya puruṣa.In the vital or nervous consciousness Atman becomes the vital or dynamic being,prāṇamaya puruṣa.In the mental consciousness Atman becomes the mental being, manomaya puruṣa.In the supra-intellectual consciousness, dominated by the Truth or causal Idea(called in Veda satyam ṛtam bṛhat, theTrue, the Right, the Vast), Atman becomesthe ideal being or great Soul, vijñānamaya puruṣa or mahat ātman[4]In the consciousness proper to the universal Beatitude, Atman becomes theall-blissful being or all-enjoying and all-productive Soul, ānandamaya puruṣa.In the consciousness proper to the infinite divine self-awareness which is alsothe infinite all-effective Will (cit-tapas), Atman is the all-conscious Soulthat is source and lord of the universe, caitanya puruṣa.In the consciousness proper to the state of pure divine existence, Atman is satpuruṣa, the pure divine Self.Man, being one in his true Self with the Lord who inhabits all forms, can livein any of these states of the Self in the world and partake of its experiences.He can be anything he wills from the material to the all-blissful being. Throughthe Anandamaya he can enter into the Chaitanya and Sat Purusha. SACHCHIDANANDASachchidananda is the manifestation of the higher Purusha; its nature ofinfinite being, consciousness, power and bliss is the higher Nature, parāprakṛti. Mind, life and body are the lower nature, aparā prakṛti.The state of Sachchidananda is the higher half of universal existence, parārdha,the nature of which is Immortality, amṛtam. The state of mortal existence inMatter is the lower half, aparārdha, the nature of which is death, mṛtyu.Mind and life in the body are in the state of Death because by Ignorance theyfail to realise Sachchidananda. Realising perfectly Sachchidananda, they canconvert themselves. Mind into the nature of the Truth, vijñāna. Life into thenature of caitanya, Body into the nature of sat, that is, into the pure essence.When this cannot be done perfectly in the body, the soul realises its true statein other forms of existence or worlds, the\"sunlit\" worlds and states offelicity, and returns upon material existence to complete its evolution in thebody.A progressively perfect realisation in the body is the aim of human evolution.It is also possible for the soul to withdraw for an indefinable period into thepure state of Sachchidananda.The realisation of the Self as Sachchidananda is the aim of human existence. THE CONDITION OF SELF-REALISATION[5]Sachchidananda is always the pure state of Atman; it may either remainself-contained as if apart from the universe or overlook, embrace and possess itas the Lord.In fact, it does both simultaneously. (Verse 8)The Lord pervades the universe as the Virat Purusha, the Cosmic Soul (paribhūḥof the eighth verse, the One who becomes everywhere); He enters into each objectin the movement, to the Knowledge as Brahman supporting individual consciousnessand individual form, to the Ignorance as an individualised and limited being. Hemanifests as the Jivatman or individual self in the living creature.From the standpoint of our lower state in the kingdom of death and limitationAtman is Sachchidananda, supra-mental, but reflected in the mind. If the mind ispure, bright and still, there is the right reflection; if it is unpurified,troubled and obscured, the reflection is distorted and subjected to the crookedaction of the Ignorance.According to the state of the reflecting mind we may have either purity ofself-knowledge or an obscuration and distortion of knowledge in the dualities oftruth and error; a pure activity of unegoistic Will or an obscuration anddeflection of Will in the dualities of right and wrong action, sin and virtue; apure state and unmixed play of beatitude or an obscuration and perversion of itin the dualities of right and wrong enjoyment, pleasure and pain, joy and grief.It is the mental ego-sense that creates this distortion by division andlimitation of the Self. The limitation is brought about through the KsharaPurusha identifying itself with the changeable formations of Nature in theseparate body, the individual life and the egoistic mind, to the exclusion ofthe sense of unity with allexistence and with all existences.This exclusion is a fixed habit of the understanding due to our past evolutionin the movement, not an ineffugable law of human consciousness. Its diminutionand final disappearance are the condition of self-realisation.The beginning of wisdom, perfection and beatitude is the vision of the One. THE STAGES OF SELF-REALISATIONTHE VISION OF THE ALLThe first movement of self-realisation is the sense of unity with otherexistences in the universe. Its early or crude form is the attempt to understandor sympathise with others, the tendency of a widening love or compassion orfellow-feeling for others, the impulsion of work for the sake of others.The oneness so realised is a pluralistic unity, the drawing together of similarunits resulting in a collectivity or solidarity rather than in real oneness. TheMany remain to the consciousness as the real existences; the One is only theirresult.Real knowledge begins with the perception of essential oneness, — one Matter,one Life, one Mind, one Soul playing inmany forms.When this Soul of things is seen to be Sachchidananda, then knowledge isperfected. For we see Matter to be only a play of Life, Life a play of Mindenergising itself in substance, Mind a play of Truth or causal Idea representingtruth of being variously in all possible mental forms. Truth a play ofSachchidananda, Sachchidananda the self-manifestation of a supreme Unknowable,Para-Brahman or Para-Purusha.We perceive the soul in all bodies to be this one Self or Sachchidanandamultiplying itself in individual consciousness. We see also all minds, lives,bodies to be active formations of the same existence in the extended being ofthe Self.This is the vision of all existences in the Self and of the Self in allexistences which is the foundation of perfect internal liberty and perfect joyand peace.For by this vision, in proportion as it increases in intensity and completeness,there disappears from the individual mentality all jugupsā, that is to say, allrepulsion, shrinking, dislike, fear, hatred and other perversions of feelingwhich arise from division and personal opposition to other beings or to theobjectivities that surround us. Perfect equality[6] of soul is established. THE VISION OF THE SELF IN ITS BECOMINGSVision is not sufficient; one must become what inwardly one sees. The wholeinner life must be changed so as to represent perfectly in all parts of thebeing what is understood by the intellect and seen by the inner perception.In the individual soul extending itself to the All by the vision of unity(ekatvam anupaśyataḥ, seeing everywhere oneness) arranging its thoughts,emotions and sensations according to the perfect knowledge of the right relationof things which comes by the realisation of the Truth (vijānataḥ, having theperfect knowledge), there must be repeated the divine act of consciousness bywhich the one Being, eternally self-existent, manifests in itself themultiplicity of the world (sarvāṇi bhūtāni ātmaiva abhūt, the Self-Being becameall Becomings).That is to say, the human or egoistic view is that of a world of innumerableseparate creatures each self-existent and different from the others, each tryingto get its utmost possible profit out of the others and the world, but thedivine view, the way in which God sees the world, is Himself, as the sole Being,living in innumerable existences that are Himself, supporting all, helping allimpartially, working out to a divine fulfilment and under terms fixed from thebeginning, from years sempiternal, a great progressive harmony of Becoming whoselast term is Sachchidananda or Immortality. This is the viewpoint of the Self asLord inhabiting the whole movement. The individual soul has to change the humanor egoistic for the divine, supreme and universal view and live in thatrealisation.It is necessary, therefore, to have the knowledge of the transcendent Self, thesole unity, in the equation so'ham, I am He, and in that knowledge to extendone's conscious existence so as to embrace the whole Multiplicity.This is the double or synthetic ideal of the Isha Upanishad; to embracesimultaneously Vidya and Avidya, the One and the Many; to exist in the world,but change the terms of the Death into the terms of the Immortality; to have thefreedom and peace of the Non-Birth simultaneously with the activity of theBirth. (Verses 9-14).All parts of the lower being must consent to this realisation; to perceive withthe intellect is not enough. The heart must consent in a universal love anddelight, the sense-mind in a sensation of God and self everywhere, the life inthe comprehension of all aims and energies in the world as part of its ownbeing. THE ACTIVE BEATITUDEThis realisation is the perfect and complete Beatitude, embracing action, butdelivered from sorrow and self-delusion.There is no possibility of self-delusion (moha); for the soul, having attainedto the perception of the Unknowable behind all existence, is no longer attachedto the Becoming and no longer attributes an absolute value to any particularityin the universe, as if that were an object in itself and desirable in itself.All is enjoyable and has a value as the manifestation of the Self and for thesake of the Self which is manifested in it, but none for its own.[7] Desire andillusion are removed; illusion is replaced by knowledge, desire by the activebeatitude of universal possession.There is no possibility of sorrow; for all is seen as Sachchidananda andtherefore in the terms of the infinite conscious existence, the infinite will,the infinite felicity. Even pain and grief are seen to be perverse terms ofAnanda, and that Ananda which they veil here and for which they prepare thelower existence (for all suffering in the evolution is a preparation of strengthand bliss) is already seized, known and enjoyed by the soul thus liberated andperfected. For it possesses the eternal Reality of which they are theappearances.Thus it is possible, by the realisation of the unity of God and the world (īśand jagat) in the complete knowledge of the Brahman, to renounce desire andillusion through the ascent to the pure Self and the Non-Becoming and yet toenjoy by means of all things in the manifestation God in the universe through afree and illuminated self-identification with Sachchidananda in all existences. CONCLUSIONWe have, therefore, in the second movement the explanation of the first verse ofthe Upanishad. The first line, asserting that all souls are the one Lordinhabiting every object in the universe and that every object is universe inuniverse, movement in the general movement, has been explained in the terms ofcomplete oneness by the Brahman, transcendental and universal even in theindividual. One in the Many, Many in the One, Stable and Motional, exceeding andreconciling all opposites. The second line, fixing as the rule of divine lifeuniversal renunciation of desire as the condition of universal enjoyment in thespirit, has been explained by the state of self-realisation, the realisation ofthe free and transcendent Self as one's own true being, of that Self asSachchidananda and of the universe seen as the Becoming of Sachchidananda andpossessed in the terms of the right Knowledge and no longer in the terms of theIgnorance which is the cause of all attraction and repulsion, self-delusion andsorrow.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 6 But he who sees everywhere the Self in all existences and all existencesin the Self, shrinks not thereafter from aught.7 He in whom it is the Self-Being that has become all existences that areBecomings, for he has the perfect knowledge, how shall he be deluded, whenceshall he have grief who sees everywhere oneness?[2] Gita XV. 16, 17. See also XIII passim.[3] Taittiriya Upanishad II. 1-6.[4] The mahat ātman or Vast Self is frequently referred to in the Upanishads. Itis also called bhūmā, the Large.[5] I have collected under this and the preceding headings the principal ideasof the Upanishads with regard to the Self, although not expressly mentioned oralluded to in our text, because they are indispensable to an understanding ofthe complete philosophy of these Scriptures and to the relations of the thoughtwhich is developed in the Isha.[6] The state described in the Gita as samatva. Jugupsā is the feeling ofrepulsion caused by the sense of a want of harmony between one's own limitedself-formation and the contacts of the external with a consequent recoil ofgrief, fear, hatred, discomfort, suffering. It is the opposite of attractionwhich is the source of desire and attachment. Repulsion and attraction removed,we have samatva.[7] Brihadaranyaka Upanishad."},{"pageContent":"THIRD MOVEMENT1. THE LORDVerse 8[1]\"HE\"In its third movement the Upanishad takes up the justification of works alreadystated in general terms in its second verse and founds it more precisely uponthe conception of Brahman or the Self as the Lord, — īś, īśvara, para puruṣa,saḥ (He) — who is the cause of personality and governs by His law of works therhythm of the Movement and the process of the worlds that He conceives andrealises throughout eternal Time in His own self-existence.It is an error to conceive that the Upanishads teach the true existence only ofan impersonal and actionless Brahman, an impersonal God without power orqualities. They declare rather an Unknowable that manifests itself to us in adouble aspect of Personality and Impersonality. When they wish to speak of thisUnknowable in the most comprehensive and general way, they use the neuter andcall it tat. That; but this neuter does not exclude the aspect of universal andtranscendent Personality acting and governing the world (cf. Kena UpanishadIII). Still, when they intend to make prominent the latter idea they more oftenprefer to use the masculine saḥ. He, or else they employ the term Deva, God orthe Divine, or Purusha, the conscious Soul, of whom Prakriti or Maya is theexecutive Puissance, the Shakti.The Isha Upanishad, having declared the Brahman as the sole reality manifestingitself in many aspects and forms, having presented this Brahman subjectively asthe Self, the one Being of whom all existences are Becomings, and as that whichwe have to realise in ourselves and in all things and beyond all things, nowproceeds to assert the same Brahman more objectively as the Lord, the Purushawho both contains and inhabits the universe.It is He that went abroad. This Brahman, this Self is identical with the Lord,the Ish, with whose name the Upanishad opens, the Inhabitant of all forms: and,as we shall find, identical with the universal Purusha of the 16th verse, — \"ThePurusha there and there. He am I.\" It is He who has become all things andbeings, — a conscious Being, the sole Existent and Self-existent, who is Masterand Enjoyer of all He becomes. And the Upanishad proceeds to formulate thenature and manner, the general law of that becoming of God which we call theworld. For on this conception depends the Vedic idea of the two poles of deathand immortality, the reason for the existence of Avidya, the Ignorance, and thejustification of works in the world. TRANSITIONAL THOUGHTTHE DIVINE PERSONALITYThe Vedantic idea of God, \"He\", Deva or Ishwara, must not be confused with theordinary notions attached to the conception of a Personal God. Personality isgenerally conceived as identical with individuality and the vulgar idea of aPersonal God is a magnified individual like man in His nature but yet different,greater, more vast and all-overpowering. Vedanta admits the human manifestationof Brahman in man and to man, but does not admit that this is the real nature ofthe Ishwara.God is Sachchidananda. He manifests Himself as infinite existence of which theessentiality is consciousness, of which again the essentiality is bliss, isself-delight. Delight cognising variety of itself, seeking its own variety, asit were, becomes the universe. But these are abstract terms; abstract ideas inthemselves cannot produce concrete realities. They are impersonal states;impersonal states cannot in themselves produce personal activities.This becomes still clearer if we consider the manifestation of Sachchidananda.In that manifestation Delight translates itself into Love; Consciousnesstranslates itself into double terms, conceptive Knowledge, executive Force;Existence translates itself into Being, that is to say, into Person andSubstance. But Love is incomplete without a Lover and an object of Love,Knowledge without a Knower and an object of Knowledge, Force without a Workerand a Work, Substance without a Person cognising and constituting it.This is because the original terms also are not really impersonal abstractions.In delight of Brahman there is an Enjoyer of delight in consciousness of Brahmana Conscient, in existence of Brahman an Existent; but the object of Brahman'sdelight and consciousness and the term and stuff of Its existence are Itself. Inthe divine Being Knowledge, the Knower and the Known and, therefore, necessarilyalso Delight, the Enjoyer and the Enjoyed are one.This Self-Awareness and Self-Delight of Brahman has two modes of its Force ofconsciousness, its Prakriti or Maya, intensive in self-absorption, diffusive inself-extension. The intensive mode is proper to the pure and silent Brahman; thediffusive to the active Brahman. It is the diffusion of the Self-existent in theterm and stuff of His own existence that we call the world, the becoming or theperpetual movement (bhuvanam, jagat). It is Brahman that becomes; what Hebecomes is also the Brahman. The object of Love is the self of the Lover; thework is the self-figuration of the Worker; Universe is body and action of theLord.When, therefore, we consider the abstract and impersonal aspect of the infiniteexistence, we say, That\"; when we consider the Existent self-aware andself-blissful, we say, \"He\". Neither conception is entirely complete. Brahmanitself is the Unknowable beyond all conceptions of Personality andImpersonality. We may call it \"That\" to show that we exile from our affirmationall term and definition. We may equally call it \"He\", provided we speak with thesame intention of rigorous exclusion. Tat and saḥ are always the same. One thatescapes definition.In the universe there is a constant relation of Oneness and Multiplicity. Thisexpresses itself as the universal Personality and the many Persons, and bothbetween the One and the Many and among the Many themselves there is thepossibility of an infinite variety of relations. These relations are determinedby the play of the divine existence, the Lord, entering into His manifestedhabitations. They exist at first as conscious relations between individualsouls; they are then taken up by them and used as a means of entering intoconscious relation with the One. It is this entering into various relations withthe One which is the object and function of Religion. All religions arejustified by this essential necessity; all express one Truth in various ways andmove by various paths to one goal.The Divine Personality reveals Himself in various forms and names to theindividual soul. These forms and names are in a sense created in the humanconsciousness; in another they are eternal symbols revealed by the Divine whothus concretises Himself in mind-form to the multiple consciousness and aids itin its return to its own Unity.[2] HE THAT WENT ABROADIt is He that has extended Himself in the relative consciousness whose totalityof finite and changeable circumstances dependent on an equal immutable andeternal Infinity is what we call the Universe. Sa paryagāt. In this extension wehave, therefore, two aspects, one of pure infinite relationless immutability,another of a totality of objects in Time and Space working out their relationsthrough causality. Both are different and mutually complementary expressions ofthe same unknowable \"He\".To express the infinite Immutability the Upanishad uses a series of neuteradjectives, \"Bright, bodiless, without scar, without sinews, pure, unpierced byevil.\" To express the same Absolute as cause, continent and governing Inhabitantof the totality of objects and of each object in the totality (jagatyām jagat)it uses four masculine epithets, \"The Seer, the Thinker, the One who becomeseverywhere, the Self-existent\" or \"the Self-Becoming\".The Immutable is the still and secret foundation of the play and the movement,extended equally, impartially in all things, samam brahma,[3] lending itssupport to all without choice or active participation. Secure and free in Hiseternal immutability the Lord projects Himself into the play and the movement,becoming there in His self-existence all that the Seer in Him visualises and theThinker in Him conceives. Kavir manīṣī paribhūḥ svayambhūḥ. THE PURE IMMUTABLEThe pure immutability of the Lord is \"bright\". It is luminosity of pureconcentrated Self-awareness, not broken by re-fractions, not breaking out intocolour and form. It is the pure self-knowledge of the Purusha, the consciousSoul, with his Power, his executive Force contained and inactive.It is \"bodiless\", — without form, indivisible and without appearance ofdivision. It is one equal Purusha in all things, not divided by the divisions ofSpace and Time, — a pure self-conscious Absolute.It is without scar, that is, without defect, break or imperfection. It isuntouched and unaffected by the mutabilities. It supports their clash ofrelations, their play of more and less, of increase and diminution, of irruptionand interpenetration. For Itself is without action, acalaḥ sanātanaḥ,[4]\"motionless, sempiternal.\"It is without sinews. The reason for Its being without scar is that It does notput out Power, does not dispense Force in multiple channels, does not lose ithere, increase it there, replenish its loss or seek by love or by violence itscomplementary or its food. It is without nerves of force; It does not pouritself out in the energies of the Pranic dynamism, of Life, of Matarishwan.It is pure, unpierced by evil. What we call sin or evil, is merely excess anddefect, wrong placement, inharmonious action and reaction. By its equality, byits inaction even while it supports all action, the conscious Soul retains itseternal freedom and eternal purity. For it is unmodified; It watches as theSakshi, the witness, the modifications effected by Prakriti, but does notpartake of them, does not get clogged with them, receives not their impression.Na lipyate. THE SOUL INALIENABLY FREEWhat is the relation of the active Brahman and of the human soul to this pureInactive? They too are That, Action does not change the nature of the Self, butonly the nature of the diverse forms, The Self is always pure, blissful perfect,whether inactive or participating in action.The Self is all things and exceeds them. It exceeds always that in which themind is engrossed, that which it takes in a particular time and space as afigure of itself. The boundless whole is always perfect. The totality of thingsis a complete harmony without wound or flaw. The viewpoint of the part taken fora whole, in other words the Ignorance, is the broken reflection which createsthe consciousness of limitation, incompleteness and discord. We shall see thatthis Ignorance has a use in the play of the Brahman; but in itself it appears atfirst to be only a parent of evil.Ignorance is a veil that separates the mind, body and life from their source andreality, Sachchidananda. Thus obscured the mind feels itself pierced by the evilthat Ignorance creates. But the Active Brahman is always Sachchidananda usingfor its self-becoming the forms of mind, body and life. All their experiencesare therefore seen by It in the terms of Sachchidananda. It is not pierced bythe evil. For It also is the One and sees everywhere Oneness. It is not masteredby the Ignorance that It uses as a minor term of its conception.The human soul is one with the Lord; it also is in its completenessSachchidananda using Ignorance as the minor term of its being. But it hasprojected its conceptions into this minor term and established there in limitedmind its centre of vision, its viewpoint. It assumes to itself theincompleteness and the resultant sense of want, discord, desire, suffering. TheReal Man behind is not affected by all this confusion; but the apparent orexterior Man is affected. To recover its freedom it must recover itscompleteness; it must identify itself with the divine Inhabitant within, itstrue and complete self. It can then, like the Lord, conduct the action ofPrakriti without undergoing the false impression of identification with theresults of its action. It is this idea on which the Upanishad bases theassertion, \"Action cleaveth not to a man.\"To this end it must recover the silent Brahman within. The Lord possesses alwaysHis double term and conducts the action of the universe, extended in it, but notattached to or limited by His works. The human soul, entangled in mind, isobscured in vision by the rushing stream of Prakriti's works and fancies itselfto be a part of that stream and swept in its currents and in its eddies. It hasto go back in its self-existence to the silent Purusha even while participatingin its self-becoming in the movement of Prakriti. It becomes then, not only likethe silent Purusha, the witness and upholder, but also the Lord and the freeenjoyer of Prakriti and her works. An absolute calm and passivity, purity andequality within, a sovereign and inexhaustible activity without is the nature ofBrahman as we see it manifested in the universe.There is therefore no farther objection to works. On the contrary, works arejustified by the participation or self-identification of the soul with the Lordin His double aspect of passivity and activity. Tranquillity for the Soul,activity for theenergy, is the balance of the divine rhythm in man. THE LAW OF THINGSThe totality of objects (arthān) is the becoming of the Lord in the extension ofHis own being. Its principle is double. There is consciousness; there is Being.Consciousness dwells in energy (tapas) upon its self-being to produce Idea ofitself (vijсana) and form and action inevitably corresponding to the Idea. Thisis the original Indian conception of creation, self-production or projectioninto form (sṛṣṭi, prasava). Being uses its self-awareness to evolve infiniteforms of itself governed by the expansion of the innate Idea in the form. Thisis the original Indian conception of evolution, prominent in certainphilosophies such as the Sankhya (pariṇāma, vikāra, vivarta). It is the samephenomenon diversely stated.In the idea of some thinkers the world is a purely subjective evolution(vivarta), not real as objective facts; in the idea of others it is an objectivefact, a real modification (pariṇāma), but one which makes no difference to theessence of Being. Both notions claim to derive from the Upanishads as theirauthority, and their opposition comes in fact by the separation of what in theancient Vedanta was viewed as one, — as we see in this passage.Brahman is His own subject and His own object, whether in His pureself-existence or in His varied self-becoming. He is the object of His ownself-awareness; He is the Knower of His own self-being. The two aspects areinseparable, even though they seem to disappear into each other and emerge againfrom each other. All appearance of pure subjectivity holds itself as an objectimplicit in its very subjectivity; all appearance of pure objectivity holdsitself as subject implicit in its very objectivity.All objective existence is the Self-existent, the Self-becoming, svayambhū,becoming by the force of the Idea within it. The Idea is, self-contained, theFact that it becomes. For svayambhū sees or comprehends Himself in the essenceof the Fact as kavi thinks Himself out in the evolution of its possibilities asmanīṣī, becomes form of Himself in the movement in Space and Time as paribhū.These three are one operation appearing as successive in the relative, temporaland spatial Consciousness.It follows that every object holds in itself the law of its own being eternally,śāśvatībhyaḥ samābhyaḥ, from years sempiternal, in perpetual Time. All relationsin the totality of objects are thus determined by their Inhabitant, theSelf-existent, the Self-becoming, and stand contained in the nature of things bythe omnipresence of the One, the Lord, by His self-vision which is theirinherent subjective Truth, by His self-becoming which, against a background ofboundless possibilities, is the Law of their inevitable evolution in theobjective Fact.Therefore all things are arranged by Him perfectly, yāthā-tathyataḥ as theyshould be in their nature. There is an imperative harmony in the All, whichgoverns the apparent discords of individualisation. That discord would be realand operate in eternal chaos, if there were only a mass of individual forms andforces, if each form and force did not contain in itself and were not in itsreality the self-existent All, the Lord. THE PROCESS OF THINGSThe Lord appears to us in the relative notion of the process of things first asKavi, the Wise, the Seer. The Kavi sees the Truth in itself the truth in itsbecoming, in its essence, possibilities, actuality. He contains all that in theIdea, the Vijnana, called the Truth and Law, satyam ṛtam. He contains itcomprehensively, not piecemeal; the Truth and Law of things is the bṛhat, theLarge. Viewed by itself, the realm of Vijnana would seem a realm ofpredetermination, of concentration, of compelling seed-state. But it is adetermination not in previous Time, but in perpetual Time; a Fate compelled bythe Soul, not compelling it, compelling rather the action and result, present inthe expansion of the movement as well as in the concentration of the Idea.Therefore the truth of the Soul is freedom and mastery, not subjection andbondage. Purusha commands Prakriti, Prakriti does not compel Purusha. Na karmalipyate nare.The Manishi takes his stand in the possibilities. He has behind him the freedomof the Infinite and brings it in as a background for the determination of thefinite. Therefore every action in the world seems to emerge from a balancing andclashing of various possibilities. None of these, however, are effective in thedetermination except by their secret consonance with the Law of that which hasto become. The Kavi is in the Manishi and upholds him in his working. But viewedby itself the realm of the Manishi would seem to be a state of plasticity, offree-will, of the interaction of forces, but of a free-will in thought which ismet by a fate in things.For the action of the Manishi is meant to eventuate in the becoming of theParibhu. The Paribhu, called also Virat, extends Himself in the realm ofeventualities. He fulfils what is contained in the Truth, what works out in thepossibilities reflected by the mind, what appears to us as the fact objectivelyrealised. The realm of Virat would seem, if taken separately, to be that of aLaw and Predetermination which compels all things that evolve in that realm, —the iron chain of Karma, the rule of mechanical necessity, the despotism of aninexplicable Law.But the becoming of Virat is always the becoming of the self-existent Lord, —paribhūḥ svayambhūḥ. Therefore to realise the truth of that becoming we have togo back and re-embrace all that stands behind: — we have to return to the fulltruth of the free and infinite Sachchidananda.This is the truth of things as seen from above and from the Unity. It is thedivine standpoint; but we have to take account of the human standpoint whichstarts from below, proceeds from the Ignorance, and perceives these principlessuccessively, not comprehensively, as separate states of consciousness. Humanityis that which returns in experience to Sachchidananda, and it must begin frombelow, in Avidya, with the mind embodied in matter, the Thinker imprisoned andemerging from the objective Fact. This imprisoned Thinker is Man, the \"Manu\".He has to start from death and division and arrive at unity and immortality. Hehas to realise the universal in the individual and the Absolute in the relative.He is Brahman growing self-conscious in the objective multiplicity. He is theego in the cosmos vindicating himself as the All and the Transcendent.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 8 It is He that has gone abroad — That which is bright, bodiless, withoutscar of imperfection, without sinews, pure, unpierced by evil. The Seer, theThinker, the One who becomes everywhere, the Self-existent has ordered objectsperfectly according to their nature from years sempiternal.[2] It would be an error to suppose that these conceptions are in their essencelater developments of philosophical Hinduism. The conception of the many formsand names of the One is as old as the Rig-veda.[3] \"The equal Brahman\". — Gita.[4] Gita II. 24."},{"pageContent":"THIRD MOVEMENT2. KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCEVerses 9 - 11[1]VIDYA AND AVIDYAAll manifestation proceeds by the two terms, Vidya and Avidya, the consciousnessof Unity and the consciousness of Multiplicity. They are the two aspects of theMaya, the formative self-conception of the Eternal.Unity is the eternal and fundamental fact, without which all multiplicity wouldbe unreal and an impossible illusion. The consciousness of Unity is thereforecalled Vidya, the Knowledge.Multiplicity is the play or varied self-expansion of the One, shifting in itsterms, divisible in its view of itself, by force of which the One occupies manycentres of consciousness, inhabits many formations of energy in the universalMovement. Multiplicity is implicit or explicit in unity. Without it the Unitywould be either a void of non-existence or a powerless, sterile limitation tothe state of indiscriminate self-absorption or of blank repose.But the consciousness of multiplicity separated from the true knowledge in themany of their own essential oneness, — the viewpoint of the separate egoidentifying itself with the divided form and the limited action, — is a state oferror and delusion. In man this is the form taken by the consciousness ofmultiplicity. Therefore it is given the name of Avidya, the Ignorance.Brahman, the Lord, is one and all-blissful, but free from limitation by Hisunity; all-powerful. He is able to conceive Himself from multiple centres inmultiple forms from which and upon which flow multiple currents of energy, seenby us as actions or play of forces. When He is thus multiple. , He is not boundby His multiplicity, but amid all variations dwells eternally in His ownoneness. He is Lord of Vidya and Avidya. They are the two sides of Hisself-conception (Maya), the twin powers of His Energy (Chit-Shakti).Brahman, exceeding as well as dwelling in the play of His Maya, is īś, lord ofit and free. Man, dwelling in the play, is anis, not lord, not free, subject toAvidya. But this subjection is itself a play of the Ignorance, unreal inessential fact (paramārtha), real only in practical relation (vyavahāra), in theworking out of the actions of the divine Energy, the Chit-Shakti. To get back tothe essential fact of his freedom he must recover the sense of Oneness, theconsciousness of Brahman, of the Lord, realise his oneness in Brahman and withthe Lord. Recovering his freedom, realising his oneness with all existences asbecomings of the One Being who is always himself (so'ham asmi, He am I), he isable to carry out divine actions in the world, no longer subject to theIgnorance, because free in the Knowledge.The perfection of man, therefore, is the full manifestation of the Divine in theindividual through the supreme accord between Vidya and Avidya. Multiplicitymust become conscious of its oneness, Oneness embrace its multiplicity. THE EXTREME PATHSThe purpose of the Lord in the world cannot be fulfilled by following Vidyaalone or Avidya alone.Those who are devoted entirely to the principle of multiplicity and division andtake their orientation away from oneness enter into a blind darkness ofIgnorance. For this tendency is one of increasing contraction and limitation,disaggregation of the gains of knowledge and greater and greater subjection tothe mechanical necessities of Prakriti and finally to her separative andself-destructive forces. To turn away from the progression towards Oneness is toturn away from existence and from light.Those who are devoted entirely to the principle of indiscriminate Unity and seekto put away from them the integrality of the Brahman, also put away from themknowledge and completeness and enter as if into a greater darkness. They enterinto some special state and accept it for the whole, mistaking exclusion inconsciousness for transcendence in consciousness. They ignore by choice ofknowledge, as the others are ignorant by compulsion of error. Knowing all totranscend all is the right path of Vidya.Although a higher state than the other, this supreme Night is termed a greaterdarkness, because the lower is one of chaos from which reconstitution is alwayspossible, the higher is a conception of Void or Asat, an attachment tonon-existence of Self from which it is more difficult to return to fulfilment ofSelf. THE GAINS IN EITHER PATHPursued with a less entire attachment the paths of Vidya and Avidya have eachtheir legitimate gains for the human soul, but neither of these are the full andperfect thing undertaken by the individual in the manifestation.By Vidya one may attain to the state of the silent Brahman or the AksharaPurusha regarding the universe without actively participating in it or to Hisself-absorbed state of Chit in Sat from which the universe proceeds and towardswhich it returns. Both these states are conditions of serenity, plenitude,freedom from the confusions and sufferings of the world.But the highest goal of man is neither fulfilment in the movement as a separateindividual nor in the Silence separated from the movement, but in the UttamaPurusha, the Lord, He who went abroad and upholds in Himself both the Kshara andthe Akshara as modes of His being. The self of man, the Jivatman, is here inorder to realise in the individual and for the universe that one highest Self ofall. The ego created by Avidya is a necessary mechanism for affirmingindividuality in the universal as a starting-point for this supreme achievement.By Avidya one may attain to a sort of fullness of power, joy, world-knowledge,largeness of being, which is that of the Titans or of the Gods;, of Indra, ofPrajapati. This is gained in the path of self-enlargement by an ample acceptanceof the multiplicity in all its possibilities and a constant enrichment of theindividual by all the materials that the universe can pour into him. But thisalso is not the goal of man; for though it brings transcendence of the ordinaryhuman limits, it does not bring the divine transcendence of the universe in theLord of the universe. One transcends confusion of Ignorance, but not limitationof Know-ledge, — transcends death of the body, but not limitation of being, —transcends subjection to sorrow, but not subjection to joy, — transcends thelower Prakriti, but not the higher. To gain the real freedom and the perfectImmortality one would have to descend again to all that had been rejected andmake the right use of death, sorrow and ignorance.The real knowledge is that which perceives Brahman in His integrality and doesnot follow eagerly after one consciousness rather than another, is no moreattached to Vidya than to Avidya. This was the knowledge of the ancient sageswho were dhīra, steadfast in the gaze of their thought, not drawn away from thecompleteness of knowledge by one light or by another and whose perception ofBrahman was consequently entire and comprehensive and their teaching founded onthat perception equally entire and comprehensive (vicacakṣire). It is theknowledge handed down from these Ancients that is being set forth in theUpanishad. THE COMPLETE PATHBrahman embraces in His manifestation both Vidya and Avidya and if they are bothpresent in the manifestation, it is because they are both necessary to itsexistence and its accomplishment. Avidya subsists because Vidya supports andembraces it; Vidya depends upon Avidya for the preparation and the advance ofthe soul towards the great Unity. Neither could exist without the other; for ifeither were abolished, they would both pass away into something which would beneither the one nor the other, something inconceivable and ineffable beyond allmanifestation.In the worst Ignorance there is some point of the knowledge which constitutesthat form of Ignorance and some support of Unity which prevents it in its mostextreme division, limitation, obscurity from ceasing to exist by dissolving intonothingness. The destiny of the Ignorance is not that it should be dissolved outof existence, but that its elements should be enlightened, united, that whichthey strive to express delivered, fulfilled and in the fulfilment transmuted andtransfigured.In the uttermost unity of which knowledge is capable the contents of theMultiplicity are inherent and implicit and can any moment be released intoactivity. The office of Vidya is not to destroy Avidya as a thing that oughtnever to have been manifested but to draw it continually towards itself,supporting it the while and helping it to deliver itself progressively from thatcharacter of Ignorance, of the oblivion of its essential Oneness, which gives itits name.Avidya fulfilled by turning more and more to Vidya enables the individual andthe universal to become what the Lord is in Himself, conscious of Hismanifestation, conscious of His non-manifestation, free in birth, free innon-birth.Man represents the point at which the multiplicity in the universe becomesconsciously capable of this turning and fulfilment. His own natural fulfilmentcomes by following the complete path of Avidya surrendering itself to Vidya, theMultiplicity to the Unity, the Ego to the One in all and beyond all, and ofVidya accepting Avidya into itself, the Unity fulfilling the Multiplicity, theOne manifesting Himself unveiled in the individual and in the universe. MORTALITY AND IMMORTALITYMORTALITYBy Avidya fulfilled man passes beyond death, by Vidya accepting Avidya intoitself he enjoys immortality.By death is meant the state of mortality which is a subjection to the process ofconstant birth and dying as a limited ego bound to the dualities of joy andsorrow, good and evil, truth and error, love and hatred, pleasure and suffering.This state comes by limitation and self-division from the One who is all and inall and beyond all and by attachment of the idea of self to a single formationin Time and Space of body, life and mind, by which the Self excludes from itsview all that it verily is with the exception of a mass of experiences flowingout from and in upon a particular centre and limited by the capacities of aparticular mental, vital and bodily frame. This mass of experiences it organisesaround the ego-centre in the mind and linking them together in Time by a doubleaction of memory, passive in state, active in work, says continually, \"This isI,\"The result is that the soul attributes to itself a certain portion only of theplay of Prakriti or Chit-Shakti and consequently a certain limited capacity offorce of consciousness which has to bear all the impact of what the soul doesnot regard as itself but as a rush of alien forces; against them it defends itsseparate formation of individuality from dissolution into Nature or mastery byNature. It seeks to assert in the individual form and by its means its innatecharacter of Ish or Lord and so to possess and enjoy its world.But by the very definition of the ego its capacity is limited. It accepts asitself a form made of the movement of Nature which cannot endure in the generalflux of things. It has to form it by the process of the movement and this isbirth, it dissolves it by the process of the movement and this is death.It can master by the understanding only so much of its experiences as assimilatewith its own viewpoint and in a way which must always be imperfect and subjectto error because it is not the view of all or the viewpoint of the All. Itsknowledge is partly error and all the rest it ignores.It can only accept and harmonise itself with a certain number of itsexperiences, precisely because these are the only ones it can understandsufficiently to assimilate. This is its joy; the rest is sorrow or indifference.It is only capable of harmonising with the force in its body, nerves and mind acertain number of impacts of alien forces. In these it takes pleasure. The restit receives with insensibility or pain.Death therefore is the constant denial by the All of the ego's falseself-limitation in the individual frame of mind, life and body.Error is the constant denial by the All of the ego's false sufficiency in alimited knowledge.Suffering of mind and body is the constant denial by the All of the ego'sattempt to confine the universal Ananda to a false and self-regarding formationof limited and exclusive enjoyments.It is only by accepting the oneness of the All that the individual can escapefrom this constant and necessary denial and attain beyond. Then All-being,All-force, All-consciousness, All-truth, All-delight take possession of theindividual soul. It changes mortality for immortality. MORTALITY AND AVIDYABut the way of attaining to immortality is not by the self-dissolution of theindividual formation into the flux of Prakriti, neither is it by prematurelydissolving it into the All-soul which Prakriti expresses. Man moves towardssomething which fulfils the universe by transcending it. He has to prepare hisindividual soul for the transcendence and for the fulfilment.If Avidya is the cause of mortality, it is also the path out of mortality. Thelimitation has been created precisely in order that the individual may affirmhimself against the flux of Prakriti in order eventually to transcend, possessand transform it.The first necessity is therefore for man continually to enlarge himself inbeing, knowledge, joy, power in the limits of the ego so that he may arrive atthe conception of something which progressively manifests itself in him in theseterms and becomes more and more powerful to deal with the oppositions ofPrakriti and to change, individually, more and more the terms of ignorance,suffering and weakness into the terms of knowledge, joy and power and even deathinto a means of wider life.This self-enlargement has then to awaken to the perception of somethingexceeding itself, exceeding the personal manifestation. Man has so to enlargehis conception of self as to see all in himself and himself in all (Verse 6). Hehas to see that this \"I\" which contains all and is contained in all, is the One,is universal and not his personal ego. To That he has to subject his ego, Thathe has to reproduce in his nature and become, That is what he has to possess andenjoy with an equal soul in all its forms and movements.He has to see that this universal One is something entirely transcendent, thesole Being, and that the universe and all its forms, actions, egos are onlybecomings of that Being (Verse 7). World is a becoming which seeks always toexpress in motion of Time and Space, by progression in mind, life and body whatis beyond all becoming, beyond Time and Space, beyond mind, life and body.Thus Avidya becomes one with Vidya. By Avidya man passes beyond that death,suffering, ignorance, weakness which were the first terms he had to deal with,the first assertions of the One in the birth affirming Himself amid thelimitations and divisions of the Multiplicity. By Vidya he enjoys even in thebirth the Immortality. IMMORTALITYImmortality does not mean survival of the self or the ego after dissolution ofthe body. The Self always survives the dissolution of the body, because italways pre-existed before the birth of the body. The self is unborn and undying.The survival of the ego is only the first condition by which the individual soulis able to continue and link together its experiences in Avidya so as to pursuewith an increasing self-possession and mastery that process of self-enlargementwhich culminates in Vidya.By immortality is meant the consciousness which is beyond birth and death,beyond the chain of cause and effect, beyond all bondage and limitation, free,blissful, self-existent in conscious-being, the consciousness of the Lord, ofthe supreme Purusha, of Sachchidananda. IMMORTALITY AND BIRTHOn this realisation man can base his free activity in the universe.But having so far attained, what further utility has the soul for birth or forworks? None for itself, everything for God and the universe.Immortality beyond the universe is not the object of manifestation in theuniverse, for that the Self always possessed. Man exists in order that throughhim the Self may enjoy Immortality in the birth as well as in the non-becoming.Nor is individual salvation the end; for that would only be the sublime of theego, not its self-realisation through the Lord in all.Having realised his own immortality, the individual has yet to fulfil God's workin the universe. He has to help the life, he mind and the body in all beings toexpress progressively Immortality and not mortality.This he may do by the becoming in the material body which we ordinarily callbirth, or from some status in another world or even, it is possible, from beyondworld. But birth in the body is the most close, divine and effective form ofhelp which the liberated can give to those who are themselves still bound to theprogression of birth in the lowest world of the Ignorance.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 9 Into a blind darkness they enter who follow after the Ignorance, they asif into a greater darkness who devote themselves to the Knowledge alone.10 Other, verily, it is said, is that which comes by the Knowledge, other thatwhich comes by the Ignorance; this is the lore we have received from the wisewho revealed That to our understanding.11 He who knows That as both in one, the Knowledge and the Ignorance, by theIgnorance crosses beyond death and by the Knowledge enjoys Immortality."},{"pageContent":"THIRD MOVEMENT3. BIRTH AND NON-BIRTHVerses 12 - 14[1]THE BIRTH AND THE NON-BIRTHThe Self outside Nature does not become; it is immutable as well as eternal. TheSelf in Nature becomes, it changes its states and forms. This entry into variousstates and forms in the succession of Time is Birth in Nature.Because of these two positions of the Self, in Nature and out of Nature, movingin the movement and seated above the movement, active in the development andeating the fruits of the tree of Life or inactive and simply regarding, thereare two possible states of conscious existence directly opposed to each other ofwhich the human soul is capable, the state of Birth, the state of Non-Birth.Man starts from the troubled state of Birth, he arrives at that tranquil poiseof conscious existence liberated from the movement which is the Non-Birth. Theknot of the Birth is the ego-sense; the dissolution of the ego-sense brings usto the Non-Birth. Therefore the Non-Birth is also called the Dissolution(vināśa).Birth and Non-Birth are not essentially physical conditions, but soul-states. Aman may break the knot of the ego-sense and yet remain in the physical body; butif he concentrates himself solely in the state of dissolution of ego, then he isnot born again in the body. He is liberated from birth as soon as the presentimpulse of Nature which continues the action of the mind and body has beenexhausted. On the other hand if he attaches himself to the Birth, theego-principle in him seeks continually to clothe itself in fresh mental andphysical forms. THE EVIL OF THE EXTREMESNeither attachment to Non-Birth nor attachment to Birth is the perfect way. Forall attachment is an act of ignorance and a violence committed upon the Truth.Its end also is ignorance, a state of blind darkness.Exclusive attachment to Non-Birth leads to a dissolution into indiscriminateNature or into the Nihil, into the Void, and both of these are states of blinddarkness. For the Nihil is an attempt not to transcend the state of existence inbirth, but to annul it, not to pass from a limited into an illimitableexistence, but from existence into its opposite. The opposite of existence canonly be the Night of negative consciousness, a state of ignorance and not ofrelease.On the other hand, attachment to Birth in the body means a constantself-limitation and an interminable round of egoistic births in the tower formsof egoism without issue or release. This is, from a certain point of view, aworse darkness than the other; for it is ignorant even of the impulse ofrelease. It is not an error in the grasping after truth, but a perpetualcontentment with the state of blindness. It cannot lead even eventually to anygreater good, because it does not dream of any higher condition. THE GOOD OF THE EXTREMESOn the other hand each of these tendencies, pursued with a certain relativenessto the other, has its own fruit and its own good. Non-Birth pursued as the goalof Birth and a higher, fuller and truer existence may lead to withdrawal intothe silent Brahman or into the pure liberty of the Non-Being. Birth, pursued asa means of progress and self-enlargement, leads to a greater and fuller lifewhich may, in its turn, become a vestibule to the final achievement. THE PERFECT WAYBut neither of these results is perfect in itself nor the true goal of humanity.Each of them brings its intended portion into the perfect good of the human soulonly when it is completed by the other.Brahman is both Vidya and Avidya, both Birth and Non-Birth. The realisation ofthe Self as the unborn and the poise of the soul beyond the dualities of birthand death in the infinite and transcendent existence are the conditions of afree and divine life in the Becoming. The one is necessary to the other. It isby participation in the pure unity of the Immobile (Akshara) Brahman that thesoul is released from its absorption in the stream of the movement. So releasedit identifies itself with the Lord to whom becoming and non-becoming are onlymodes of His existence and is able to enjoy immortality in the manifestationwithout being caught in the wheel of Nature's delusions. The necessity of birthceases, its personal object having been fulfilled; the freedom of becomingremains. For the Divine enjoys equally and simultaneously the freedom of Hiseternity and the freedom of His becoming.It may even be Said that to have had the conscious experience of a dissolutionof the very idea of Being into the supreme Non-Being is necessary for thefullest and freest possession of Being itself. This would be from the syntheticstandpoint the justification of the great effort of Buddhism to exceed theconception of all positive being even in its widest or purest essentiality.Thus by dissolution of ego and of the attachment to birth the soul crossesbeyond death; it is liberated from all limitation in the dualities. Havingattained this liberation it accepts becoming as a process of Nature subject tothe soul and not binding upon it and by this free and divine becoming enjoysImmortality. THE JUSTIFICATION OF LIFEThus, the third movement of the Upanishad is a justification of life and works,which were enjoined upon the seeker of the Truth in its second verse. Works arethe essence of Life. Life is a manifestation of the Brahman; in Brahman the LifePrinciple arranges a harmony of the seven principles of conscious being by whichthat manifestation works out its involution and evolution. In BrahmanMatarishwan disposes the waters, the sevenfold movement of the divine Existence.That divine Existence is the Lord who has gone abroad in the movement andunrolled the universe in His three modes as All-Seer of the Truth of things.Thinker-out of their possibilities, Realiser of their actualities. He hasdetermined all things sovereignly in their own nature, development and goal fromyears sempiternal.That determination works out through His double power of Vidya and Avidya,consciousness of essential unity and consciousness of phenomenal multiplicity.The Multiplicity carried to its extreme limit returns upon itself in theconscious individual who is the Lord inhabiting the forms of the movement andenjoying first the play of the Ignorance. Afterwards by development in theIgnorance the soul returns to the capacity of Knowledge and enjoys by theKnowledge Immortality.This Immortality is gained by the dissolution of the limited ego and its chainof births into the consciousness of the unborn and undying, the Eternal, theLord, the ever-free. But it is enjoyed by a free and divine becoming in theuniverse and not outside the universe; for there it is always possessed, buthere in the material body it is to be worked out and enjoyed by the divineInhabitant under circumstances that are in appearance the most opposite to itsterms, in the life of the individual and in the multiple life of the universe.Life has to be transcended in order that it may be freely accepted; the works ofthe universe have to be over-passed in order that they may be divinelyfulfilled.The soul even in apparent bondage is really free and only plays at being bound;but it has to go back to the consciousness of freedom and possess and enjoyuniversally not this or that but the Divine and the All.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 12 Into a blind darkness they enter who follow after the Non-Birth, they asif into a greater darkness who devote themselves to the Birth alone.13 Other, verily, it is said, is that which comes by the Birth, other that whichcomes by the Non-Birth; this is the lore we have received from the wise whorevealed That to our understanding.14 He who knows That as both in one, the Birth and the dissolution of Birth, bythe dissolution crosses beyond death and by the Birth enjoys Immortality."},{"pageContent":"FOURTH MOVEMENT1. THE WORLDS — SURYAVerses 15 - 16[1]THE WORLDS AFTER DEATHIn the third verse the Upanishad has spoken of sunless worlds enveloped in blindgloom. In its third movement it also speaks twice of the soul entering into ablind gloom, but here it is a state of consciousness that seems to be indicatedand not a world. Nevertheless, the two statements differ little in effect; forin the Vedantic conception a world is only a condition of conscious beingorganised in the terms of the seven constituent principles of manifestedexistence. According to the state of consciousness which we reach here in thebody, will be our state of consciousness and the surroundings organised by itwhen the mental being passes out of the body. For the individual soul out of thebody must either disappear into the general constituents of its existence, mergeitself into Brahman or persist in an organisation of consciousness other thanthe terrestrial and in relations with the universe other than those which areappropriate to life in the body. This state of consciousness and the relationsbelonging to it are the other worlds, the worlds after death. THE THREE STATESThe Upanishad admits three states of the soul in relation to the manifesteduniverse, — terrestrial life by birth in the body, the survival of theindividual soul after death in other states and the immortal existence whichbeing beyond birth and death, beyond manifestation can yet enter into forms asthe Inhabitant and embrace Nature as its lord. The two former conditionsappertain to the Becoming; Immortality stands in the Self, in the Non-Birth, andenjoys the Becoming.The Upanishad, although it does not speak expressly of rebirth in an earthlybody, yet implies that belief in its thought and language, — especially in the17th verse. On the basis of this belief in rebirth man may aim at three distinctobjects beyond death, — a better or more fortunate life or lives upon earth,eternal enjoyment of bliss in an ultra-terrestrial world of light and joy or atranscendence exclusive of all universal existence, merged in the Supreme as inone's true self, but having no relation with the actual or possible contents ofits infinite consciousness. REBIRTHThe attainment of a better life or lives upon earth is not the consummationoffered to the soul by the thought of the Upanishad. But it is an importantintermediate object so long as the soul is in a state of growth andself-enlargement and has not attained to liberation. The obligation of birth anddeath is a sign that the mental being has not yet unified itself with its truesupramental self and spirit, but is dwelling \"in Avidya and enclosed within it\".[2] To attain that union the life of man upon earth is its appointed means.After liberation the soul is free, but may still participate in the entiremovement and return to birth no longer for its own sake but for the sake ofothers and according to the will in it of its divine Self, the Lord of itsmovement. HEAVEN AND HELLThe enjoyment of beatitude in a heaven beyond is also not the supremeconsummation. But Vedantic thought did not envisage rebirth as an immediateentry after death into a new body; the mental being in man is not so rigidlybound to the vital and physical, — on the contrary, the latter are ordinarilydissolved together after death, and there must therefore be, before the soul isattracted back towards terrestrial existence, an interval in which itassimilates its terrestrial experiences in order to be able to constitute a newvital and physical being upon earth. During this interval it must dwell instates or worlds beyond and these may be favourable or unfavourable to itsfuture development. They are favourable in proportion as the light of theSupreme Truth of which Surya is a symbol enters into them, but states ofintermediate ignorance or darkness are harmful to the soul in its progress.Those enter into them, as has been affirmed in the third verse, who do hurt tothemselves by shutting themselves to the light or distorting the natural courseof their development. The Vedantic heavens are states of light and the soul'sexpansion; darkness, self-obscuration and self-distortion are the nature of theHells which it has to shun.In relation to the soul's individual development, therefore, the life in worldsbeyond, like the life upon earth, is a means and not an object in itself. Afterliberation the soul may possess these worlds as it possesses the material birth,accepting in them a means towards the divine manifestation in which they form acondition of its fullness, each being one of the parts in a series of organisedstates of conscious being which is linked with and supports all the rest. TRANSCENDENCETranscendence is the goal of the development, but it does not exclude thepossession of that which is transcended. The soul need not and should not pushtranscendence so far as to aim at its own extinction. Nirvana is extinction ofthe ego-limitations, but not of all possibility of manifestation, since it canbe possessed even in the body.The desire of the exclusive liberation is the last desire that the soul in itsexpanding knowledge has to abandon; the delusion that it is bound by birth isthe last delusion that it has to destroy. SURYA AND AGNIOn the basis of this conception of the worlds and the relation of thesedifferent soul-states to each other the Upanishad proceeds to indicate the twolines of knowledge and action which lead to the supreme vision and the divinefelicity. This is done under the form of an invocation to Surya and Agni, theVedic godheads, representative one of the supreme Truth and its illuminations,the other of the divine Will raising, purifyingand perfecting human action. THE ORDER OF THE WORLDSTo understand entirely the place and function of Surya we must enter a littlemore profoundly into the Vedic conception of the seven worlds and the principlesof consciousness they represent.All conscious being is one and indivisible in itself, but in manifestation itbecomes a complex rhythm, a scale of harmonies, a hierarchy of states ormovements. For what we call a state is only the organisation of a complexmovement. This hierarchy is composed by a descending or involutive and anascending or evolutive movement of which Spirit and Matter are the highest andlowest terms.Spirit is Sat or pure existence, pure in self-awareness (Chit), pure inself-delight (Ananda). Therefore Spirit can be regarded as a triune basis of allconscious being. There are three terms, but they are really one. For all pureexistence is in its essence pure self-conscience and all pure self-conscience isin its essence pure self-delight. At the same time our consciousness is capableof separating these three by the Idea and the Word and even of creating foritself in its divided or limited movements the sense of their apparentopposites.An integral intuition into the nature of conscious being shows us that it isindeed one in essence but also that it is capable of an infinite potentialcomplexity and multiplicity in self-experience. The working of this potentialcomplexity and multiplicity in the One is what we call from our point of viewmanifestation or creation or world or becoming — (bhuvana, bhāva). Without it noworld-existence is possible.The agent of this becoming is always the self-conscience of the Being. The powerby which the self-conscience brings out of itself its potential complexities istermed Tapas, Force or Energy, and, being self-conscious, is obviously of thenature of Will. But not Will as we understand it, something exterior to itsobject, other than its works, labouring on material outside itself, but Willinherent in the Being, inherent in the becoming, one with the movement ofexistence, — self-conscious Will that becomes what it sees and knows in itself.Will that is expressed as Force of its own work and formulates itself in theresult of its work. By this Will, Tapas or Chit-Shakti, the worlds are created. THE HIGHER WORLDSAll organisation of self-conscient being which takes as its basis the unity ofpure existence belongs to the world of the highest creation, parārdha — theworlds of the Spirit.We can conceive three principal formations.When tapas or energy of self-conscience dwells upon sat or pure existence as itsbasis, the result is satyaloka or world of true existence. The soul in satyalokais one with all its manifestations by oneness of essence and therefore one inself-conscience and in energy of self-conscience and one also in bliss.When tapas dwells upon active power of cit as its basis, the result is tapolokaor world of energy of self-conscience. The soul in tapoloka is one with allmanifestations in this Energy and therefore enjoys oneness also in the totalityof their bliss and possesses equally their unity of essence.When tapas dwells upon active Delight of being as its basis, the result isjanaloka, world of creative Delight. The soul in janaloka is one in delight ofbeing with all manifestation and through that bliss one also in conscious energyand in essence of being.All these are states of consciousness in which unity and multiplicity have notyet been separated from each other. All is in all, each in all and all in each,inherently, by the very nature of conscious being and without effort ofconception or travail of perception. There is no night, no obscurity. Neither isthere, properly speaking, any dominant action of illuminating Surya. For thewhole of consciousness there is self-luminous and needs no light other thanitself. The distinct existence of Surya is lost in the oneness of the Lord orPurusha; that luminous oneness is Surya's most blessed form of all. THE LOWER CREATIONIn the lower creation also there are three principles. Matter, Life, and Mind.Sat or pure existence appears there as extended substance or Matter; Will orForce appears as Life which is in its nature creative or manifesting Force andthat Force is in its nature a self-conscient will involved and obscure in theforms of its creation. It is liberated from the involution and obscurity bydelight of being struggling to become conscious of itself in desire andsensation; the result is the emergence of Mind. So at least it appears to us inthe ascending or evolutive movement.Wherever there is Matter, Life and Mind are present involved or evolving. Soalso. Life and Mind have some kind of material form as the condition of theiractivities. These three appear not as triune, owing to their domination by thedividing principle of Avidya, but as triple.In the organisation of consciousness to which we belong, Tapas dwells uponMatter as its basis. Our consciousness is determined by the divisibility ofextended substance in its apparent forms. This is Bhurloka, the material world,the world of formal becoming.But we may conceive of a world in which dynamic Life-force with sensationemergent in it is the basis and determines without the gross obstacle of Matterthe forms that it shall take. This organisation of consciousness has for itsfield Bhuvarloka, the world of free vital becoming in form.We may conceive also of an organised state of consciousness in which Mindliberates itself from subjection to material sensation and becoming dominantdetermines its own forms instead of being itself determined by the forms inwhich it finds itself as a result of life-evolution. This formation is Swarlokaor world of free, pure and luminous mentality.In these lower worlds consciousness is normally broken up and divided. The lightof Surya, the Truth, is imprisoned in the night of the subconscient or appearsonly reflected in limited centres or with its rays received by those centres andutilised according to their individual nature. THE INTERMEDIATE WORLDBetween these two creations, linking them together, is the world or organisationof consciousness of which the infinite Truth of things is the foundation. Theredominant individualisation no longer usurps the all-pervading soul and thefoundation of consciousness is its own vast totality arranging in itselfindividualised movements which never lose the consciousness of their integralityand total oneness with all others. Multiplicity no longer prevails and divides,but even in the complexity of its movements always refers back to essentialunity and its own integral totality. This world is therefore called Maharloka orworld of large consciousness.The principle of Maharloka is Vijnana, the Idea. But this Vijnana is intuitionalor rather gnostic Idea,[3] not intellectual conception. The difference is thatintellectual conception not only tends towards form, but determines itself inthe form of the idea and once determined distinguishes itself sharply from otherconceptions. But pure intuitional or gnostic Idea sees itself in the Being aswell as in the Becoming. It is one with the existence which throws out the formas a symbol of itself and it therefore carries with it always the knowledge ofthe Truth behind the form. It is in its nature self-conscience of the being andpower of the One, aware always of its totality, starting therefore from thetotality of all existence and perceiving directly its contents. Its nature isdṛṣṭi, seeing, not conceiving. It is the vision at once of the essence and theimage. It is this intuition or gnosis which is the Vedic Truth, the self-visionand all-vision of Surya. THE LAW OF THE TRUTHThe face of this Truth is covered as with a brilliant shield, as with a goldenlid; covered, that is to say, from the view of our human consciousness. For weare mental beings and our highest ordinary mental sight is composed of theconcepts and percepts of the mind, which are indeed a means of knowledge, raysof the Truth, but not in their nature truth of existence, only truth of form. Bythem we arrange our knowledge of the appearances of things and try to infer thetruth behind. The true knowledge is truth of existence, satyam, not mere truthof form or appearance.We can only arrive at the true Truth, if Surya works in us to remove thisbrilliant formation of concepts and percepts and replaces them by theself-vision and all-vision.For this it is necessary that the law and action of the Truth should bemanifested in us. We must learn to see things as they are, see ourselves as weare. Our present action is one in which self-knowledge and will are divided. Westart with a fundamental falsehood, that we have a separate existence fromothers and we try to know the relations of separate beings in their separatenessand act on the knowledge so formed for an individual utility. The law of theTruth would work in us if we saw the totality of our existence containing allothers its forms created by the action of the totality, its powers working inand by the action of the totality. Our internal and external action would thenwell naturally and directly out of our self-existence, out of the very truth ofthings and not in obedience to an intermediate principle which is in its naturea falsifying reflection. THE FULFILMENT OF SURYA IN MANNevertheless even in our ordinary action there is the beginning or at least theseed of the Truth which must liberate us. Behind every act and perception thereis an intuition, a truth which, if it is continually falsified in the form, yetpreserves itself in the essence and works to lead us by increasing light andlargeness to truth in the manifestation. Behind all this travail ofdifferentiation and division there is an insistent unifying tendency which isalso continually falsified in the separate result, but yet leads persistentlytowards our eventual integrality in knowledge, in being and in will.Surya is Pushan, fosterer or increaser. His work must be to effect thisenlargement of the divided self-perception and action of will into the integralwill and knowledge. He is sole seer and replacing other forms of knowledge byhis unifying vision enables us to arrive finally at oneness. That intuitivevision of the totality, of one in All and All in one, becomes the ordainer ofthe right law of action in us, the law of the Truth. For Surya is Yama, theOrdainer or Controller who assures the law, the Dharma. Thus we arrive at thefullness of action of the Illuminer in us, accomplish the entirety of theTruth-Consciousness. We are then able to see that all that is contained in thebeing of Surya, in the Vijnana which builds up the worlds is becomingofexistence in the one existence and one Lord of all becoming, the Purusha,Sachchidananda. All becoming is born in the Being who himself exceeds allbecomings and is their Lord, Prajapati.By the revelation of the vision of Surya the true knowledge is formed. In thisformation the Upanishad indicates two successive actions. First, there is anarrangement or marshalling of the rays of Surya, that is to say, the truthsconcealed behind our concepts and percepts are brought out by separateintuitions of the image and the essence of the image and arranged in their truerelations to each other. So we arrive at totalities of intuitive knowledge andcan finally go beyond to unity. This is the drawing together of the light ofSurya. This double movement is necessitated by the constitution of our mindswhich cannot, like the original Truth-Consciousness, start at once from thetotality and perceive its contents from within. The mind can hardly conceiveunity except as an abstraction, a sum or a void. Therefore it has to begradually led from its own manner to that which exceeds it. It has to carry outits own characteristic action of arrangement, but with the help and by theoperation of the higher faculty, no longer arbitrarily, but following the veryaction of the Truth of existence itself. Afterwards, by thus graduallycorrecting the manner of its own characteristic action it can succeed inreversing that characteristic action itself and learn to proceed from the wholeto the contents instead of proceeding from \"parts”[4] mistaken for entities toan apparent whole which is still a \"part\" and still mistaken for an entity. THE ONE EXISTENTThus by the action of Surya we arrive at that light of the supremesuper-conscient in which even the intuitive knowledge of the truth of thingsbased upon the total vision passes into the self-luminous self-vision of the oneexistent, one in all infinite complexities of a self-experience which neverloses its unity or its self-luminousness. This is Surya's godliest form of all.For it is the supreme Light, the supreme Will, the supreme Delight of existence.This is the Lord, the Purusha, the self-conscient Being. When we have thisvision, there is the integral self-knowledge, the perfect seeing, expressed inthe great cry of the Upanishad, so'ham. The Purusha there and there, He am I.The Lord manifests Himself in the movements and inhabits many forms, but it isOne who inhabits all. This self-conscient being, this real “I” whom the mentalbeing individualised in the form is aware of as his true self — it is He. It isthe All; and it is that which transcends the All.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 15 The face of Truth is covered with a brilliant golden lid; that do thouremove, O Fosterer, for the law of the Truth, for sight.16 O Fosterer, O sole Seer, O Ordainer, O illumining Sun, O power of the Fatherof creatures, marshal thy rays, draw together thy light; the Lustre which is thymost blessed form of all, that in Thee I behold. The Purusha there and there. Heam I.[2] Avidyāyām antare vartamānāḥ. — Katha Upanishad I. 2.5; Mundaka I. 2. 8.[3] Intuition (revelation, inspiration, intuitive perception, intuitivediscrimination) is Vijnana working in mind under the conditions and in the formsof mind. Gnosis or true supermind is a power above mind working in its own law,out of the direct identity of the supreme Self, his absolute self-consciousTruth knowing herself by her own power of absolute Light without any need ofseeking, even the most luminous seeking.[4] There are really no parts, existence being indivisible."},{"pageContent":"FOURTH MOVEMENT2. ACTION AND THE DIVINE WILLVerses 17-18[1]THE SIDE OF ACTIONThrough Surya then, through the growth of the illumination in the mind whichenables it eventually to pass beyond itself, we have the first principle ofprogress from mortality to immortality. It is by the Sun as a door or gate[2]that the individual, the limited consciousness attains to the full consciousnessand life in the one, supreme and all-embracing Soul.Both consciousness and life are included in the formula of Immortality;Knowledge is incomplete without action. Chit fulfils itself by Tapas,Consciousness by energy. And as Surya represents the divine Light, so Agni tothe ancient Rishis represented divine Force, Power or Will-in-Consciousness. Theprayer to Agni completes the prayer to Surya. THE INDIVIDUAL WILLAs in knowledge, so in action, unity is the true foundation. The individual,accepting division as his law, isolating himself in his own egoistic limits, isnecessarily mortal, obscure and ignorant in his workings. He follows in his aimsand in his methods a knowledge that is personal, governed by desire, habits ofthought, obscure subconscious impulses or, at best, a broken partial andshifting light. He lives by rays and not in the full blaze of the Sun. Hisknowledge is narrow in its objectivity, narrow in its subjectivity, in neitherone with the integral knowledge and the total working and total will in theuniverse. His action, therefore, is crooked, many-branching, hesitating andfluctuating in its impulsion and direction; it beats about among falsehoods tofind the Truth, tosses or scraps fragments together to piece out the whole,stumbles among errors and sins to find the right. Being neither one-visioned norwhole-visioned, having neither the totality of the universal Will nor theconcentrated oneness of the transcendent, the individual will cannot walkstraight on the right or good path towards the Truth and the Immortality.Governed by desire, exposed to the shock of the forces around it with which itsegoism and ignorance forbid it to put itself in harmony, it is subject to thetwin children of the Ignorance, suffering and falsehood. Not having the divineTruth and Right it cannot have the divine Felicity. AGNI, THE DIVINE WILLBut as there is in and behind all the falsehoods of our material mind and reasona Light that prepares by this twilight the full dawn of the Truth in man, sothere is in and behind all our errors, sins and stumblings a secret Will,tending towards Love and Harmony, which knows where it is going and prepares andcombines our crooked branchings towards the straight path which will be thefinal result of their toil and seeking. The emergence of this Will and thatLight is the condition of immortality.This Will is Agni. Agni is in the Rig-veda, from which the closing verse of theUpanishad is taken, the flame of the Divine Will or Force of Consciousnessworking in the worlds. He is described as the immortal in mortals, the leader ofthe journey, the divine Horse that bears us on the road, the \"son ofcrookedness\" who himself knows and is the straightness and the Truth. Concealedand hard to seize in the workings of this world because they are all falsifiedby desire and egoism, he uses them to transcend them and emerges as theuniversal in Man or universal Power, Agni Vaishwanara, who contains in himselfall the gods and all the worlds, upholds all the universal workings and finallyfulfils the godhead, the immortality. He is the worker of the divine Work. It isthese symbols which govern the sense of the two final verses of the Upanishad. THE IMMORTAL LIFE-PRINCIPLELife is the condition from which the Will and the Light emerge. It is said inthe Veda that Vayu or Matarishwan, the Life-principle, is he who brings downAgni from Surya in the high and far-off supreme world. Life calls down thedivine Will from the Truth-Consciousness into the realm of mind and body toprepare here, in Life, its own manifestation. Agni, enjoying and devouring thethings of Life, generates the Maruts, nervous forces of Life that become forcesof thought; they, upheld by Agni, prepare the action of Indra, the luminousMind, who is for our life-powers their Rishi or finder of the Truth and Right.Indra slays Vritra, the Coverer, dispels the darkness, causes Surya to rise uponour being and go abroad over its whole field with the rays of the Truth. Suryais the Creator or manifester, Savitri, who manifests in this mortal world theworld or state of immortality, dispels the evil dream of egoism, sin andsuffering and transforms Life into the immortality, the good, the beatitude. TheVedic gods are a parable of human life emerging, mounting, lifting itselftowards the Godhead.Life, body, action, will, these are our first materials. Matter supplies us withthe body; but it is only a temporary knot of the movement, a dwelling-place ofthe Purusha in which he presides over the activities generated out of theLife-principle. Once it is thrown aside by the Life-principle it is dissolved;ashes are its end. Therefore the body is not ourselves, but only an outer tooland instrument. For Matter is the principle of obscurity and division, of birthand death, of formation and dissolution. It is the assertion of death. Immortalman must not identify himself with the body.The Life-principle in us survives. It is the immortal Breath[3] or, as thephrase really means, the subtle force of existence which is superior to theprinciple of birth and death. At first sight it may appear that birth and deathare attributes of the Life, but it is not really so: birth and death areprocesses of Matter, of the body. The Life-principle is not formed and dissolvedin the formulation and dissolution of the body; if that were so, there could beno continuity of the individual existence and all would go back at death intothe formless. Life forms body, it is not formed by it. It is the thread uponwhich the continuity of our successive bodily lives is arranged, preciselybecause it is itself immortal. It associates itself with the perishable body andcarries forward the mental being, the Purusha in the mind, upon his journey. WILL AND MEMORYThis journey consists in a series of activities continued from life to life inthis world with intervals of life in other states. The Life-principle maintainsthem; it supplies their material in the formative energy which takes shape inthem. But their presiding god is not the Life-principle; it is the Will. Will isKratu, the effective power behind the act. It is of the nature of consciousness;it is energy of consciousness, and although present in all forms, conscious,subconscious or superconscious, vital, physical or mental, yet comes into itskingdom only when it emerges in Mind. It uses the mental faculty of memory tolink together and direct consciously the activities towards the goal of theindividual.In man the use of consciousness by the mental will is imperfect, because memoryis limited. Our action is both dispersed and circumscribed because mentally welive from hour to hour in the current of Time, holding only to that whichattracts or seems immediately useful to our egoistic mind. We live in what weare doing, we do not control what has been done, but are rather controlled byour past works which we have forgotten. This is because we dwell in the actionand its fruits instead of living in the soul and viewing the stream of actionfrom behind it. The Lord, the true Will, stands back from the actions andtherefore is their lord and not bound by them.The Upanishad solemnly invokes the Will to remember the thing that has beendone, so as to contain and be conscious of the becoming, so as to become a powerof knowledge and self-possession and not only a power of impulsion andself-formulation. It will thus more and more approximate itself to the true Willand preside over the co-ordination of the successive lives with a consciouscontrol. Instead of being carried from life to life in a crooked path, as bywinds, it will be able to proceed more and more straight in an ordered series,linking life to life with an increasing force of knowledge and direction untilit becomes the fully conscious Will moving with illumination on the straightpath towards the immortal felicity. The mental will, kratu, becomes what it atpresent only represents, the divine Will, Agni. WILL AND KNOWLEDGEThe essentiality of the divine Will is that in it Consciousness and Energy,Knowledge and Force are one. It knows all manifestations, all things that takebirth in the worlds. It is Jatavedas, that which has right knowledge of allbirths. It knows them in the law of their being, in their relation to otherbirths, in their aim and method, in their process and goal, in their unity withall and their difference from all. It is this divine Will that conducts theuniverse; it is one with all the things that it combines and its being, itsknowledge, its action are inseparable from each other. What it is, it knows;what it knows, that it does and becomes.But as soon as egoistic consciousness emerges and interferes, there is adisturbance, a division, a false action. Will becomes an impulsion ignorant ofits secret motive and aim, knowledge becomes a dubious and partial ray not inpossession of the will, the act and the result, but only striving to possess andinform them. This is because we are not in possession of our self,[4] our truebeing, but only of the ego. What we are, we know not; what we know, we cannoteffect. For knowledge is real and action in harmony with true knowledge onlywhen they proceed naturally out of the conscious, illumined and self-possessingsoul, in which being, knowledge and action are one movement. SURRENDER TO THE DIVINE WILLThis is the change that happens when, the mental will approximating more andmore to the divine, Agni burns out in us. It is that increasing knowledge andforce which carries us finally into the straight or good path out of thecrookedness. It is the divine will, one with the divine knowledge, which leadsus towards felicity, towards the state of Immortality. All that belongs to thedeviations of the ego, all that obscures and drives or draws us into this orthat false path with its false lures and stumblings are put away from us by it.These things fall away from the divinised Will and cease to find lodging in ourconsciousness.Therefore the sign of right action is the increasing and finally the completesubmission of the individual to the divine Will which the illumination of Suryareveals in him. Although manifested in his consciousness, this Will is notindividual. It is the will of the Purusha who is in all things and transcendsthem. It is the will of the Lord.Knowledge of the Lord as the One in the fully self-conscious being, submissionto the Lord as the universal and transcendent in the fully self-consciousaction, are the two keys of the divine gates, the gates of Immortality.And the nature of the two united is an illuminated Devotion which accepts,aspires to and fulfils God in the human existence. CONCLUSIONThus the fourth movement indicates psychologically the double process of thatattainment of Immortality which is the subject of the third movement, the stateof bliss and truth within and the worlds of Light after death culminating in theidentity of the self-luminous One. At the same time it particularises under thecover of Vedic symbols the process of that self-knowledge and identificationwith the Self and all its becomings which is the subject of the second movementand of that liberated action in the assertion of which the first culminates. Itis thus a fitting close and consummation to the Upanishad.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 17 The Breath of things is an immortal life, but of this body ashes are theend — OM!

Upanishadic thought fallsnaturally into two great periods; in one, the earlier, it still kept close toits Vedic roots, reflected the old psychological system of the Vedic Rishis andpreserved what may be called their spiritual pragmatism; in the other and later,in which the form and thought became more modern and independent of earlysymbols and origins, some of the principal elements of Vedic thought andpsychology begin to be omitted or to lose their previous connotation and thefoundations of the later ascetic and anti-pragmatic Vedanta begin to appear. TheIsha belongs to the earlier or Vedic group. It is already face to face with theproblem of reconciling human life and activity with the Monistic standpoint andits large solution of the difficulty is one of the most interesting passages ofVedantic literature. It is the sole Upanishad which offered almost insuperabledifficulties to the extreme illusionism and anti-pragmatism of Shankaracharyaand it was even, for this reason, excised from the list of authoritativeUpanishads by one of his greatest followers. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE UPANISHADThe principle it follows throughout is the uncompromising reconciliation ofuncompromising extremes. Later thought took one series of terms, — the World,Enjoyment, Action, the Many, Birth, the Ignorance, — and gave them a more andmore secondary position, exalting the opposite series. God, Renunciation,Quietism, the One, Cessation of Birth, the Knowledge until this trend of thoughtculminated in Illusionism and the idea of existence in the world as a snare anda meaningless burden imposed inexplicably on the soul by itself, which must becast aside as soon as possible. It ended in a violent cutting of the knot of thegreat enigma. This Upanishad tries instead to get hold of the extreme ends ofthe knots, disengage and place them alongside of each other in a release thatwill be at the same time a right placing and relation. It will not qualify orsubordinate unduly any of the extremes, although it recognises a dependence ofone on the other. Renunciation is to go to the extreme, but also enjoyment is tobe equally integral; Action has to be complete and ungrudging, but also freedomof the soul from its works must be absolute; Unity utter and absolute is thegoal, but this absoluteness has to be brought to its highest term by includingin it the whole infinite multiplicity of things.So great is this scruple in the Upanishad that having so expressed itself in theformula '\"By the Ignorance having crossed over death by the knowledge one enjoysImmortality\" that Life in the world might be interpreted as only a preliminaryto an existence beyond, it at once rights the balance by reversing the order inthe parallel formula \"By dissolution having crossed over death by birth oneenjoys Immortality\", and thus makes life itself the field of the immortalexistence which is the goal and aspiration of all life. In this conclusion itagrees with the early Vedic thought which believed all the worlds and existenceand non-existence and death and life and immortality to be here in the embodiedhuman being, there evolvent, there realisable and to be possessed and enjoyed,not dependent either for acquisition or enjoyment on the renunciation of lifeand bodily existence. This thought has never entirely passed out of Indianphilosophy, but has become secondary and a side admission not strong enough toqualify seriously the increasing assertion of the extinction of mundaneexistence as the condition of our freedom and our sole wise and worthy aim. THE OPPOSITESThe pairs of opposites successively taken up by the Upanishad and resolved are,in the order of their succession:1. The Conscious Lord and phenomenal Nature.2. Renunciation and Enjoyment.3. Action in Nature and Freedom in the Soul.4. The One stable Brahman and the multiple Movement.5. Being and Becoming.6. The Active Lord and the indifferent Akshara Brahman.7. Vidya and Avidya.8. Birth and Non-Birth.9. Works and Knowledge.These discords are thus successively resolved: GOD AND NATURE1. Phenomenal Nature is a movement of the conscious Lord. The object of themovement is to create forms of His consciousness in motion in which He as theone soul in many bodies can take up his habitation and enjoy the multiplicityand the movement with all their relations.[1] ENJOYMENT AND RENUNCIATION2. Real integral enjoyment of all this movement and multiplicity in its truthand in its infinity depends upon an absolute renunciation; but the renunciationintended is an absolute renunciation of the principle of desire founded on theprinciple of egoism and not a renunciation of world-existence.[2] This solutiondepends on the idea that desire is only an egoistic and vital deformation of thedivine Ananda or delight of being from which the world is born; by extirpationof ego and desire Ananda again becomes the conscious principle of existence.This substitution is the essence of the change from life in death to life inimmortality. The enjoyment of the infinite delight of existence free from ego,founded on oneness of all in the Lord, is what is meant by the enjoyment ofImmortality. ACTION AND FREEDOM3. Actions are not inconsistent with the soul's freedom. Man is not bound byworks, but only seems to be bound. He has to recover the consciousness of hisinalienable freedom by recovering the consciousness of unity in the Lord, unityin himself, unity with all existence.[3] This done, life and works can andshould be accepted in their fullness; for the manifestation of the Lord in lifeand works is the law of our being and the object of our world-existence. THE QUIESCENCE AND THE MOVEMENT4. What then of the Quiescence of the Supreme Being and how is persistence inthe Movement compatible with that Quiescence which is generally recognised as anessential condition of the supreme Bliss?The Quiescence and the Movement are equally one Brahman and the distinctiondrawn between them is only a phenomenon of our consciousness. So it is with theidea of space and time, the far and the near, the subjective and the objective,internal and external, myself and others, one and many. Brahman, the realexistence, is all these things to our consciousness, but in itself ineffablysuperior to all such practical distinctions. The Movement is a phenomenon of theQuiescence, the Quiescence itself may be conceived as a Movement too rapid forthe gods, that is to say, for our various functions of consciousness to followin its real nature. But it is no formal, material, spatial, temporal movement,only a movement in consciousness. Knowledge sees it all as one. Ignorancedivides and creates oppositions where there is no opposition but simplyrelations of one consciousness in itself. The ego in the body says, \"I amwithin, all else is outside; and in what is outside, this is near to me in Timeand Space, that is far.\" All this is true in present relation; but in essence itis all one indivisible movement of Brahman which is not material movement but away of seeing things in the one consciousness. BEING AND BECOMING5. Everything depends on what we see, how we look at existence in our soul'sview of things. Being and Becoming, One and Many are both true and are both thesame thing: Being is one. Becomings are many; but this simply means that allBecomings are one Being who places Himself variously in the phenomenal movementof His consciousness. We have to see the One Being, but we have not to cease tosee the many Becomings, for they exist and are included in Brahman's view ofHimself. Only, we must see with knowledge and not with ignorance. We have torealise our true self as the one unchangeable, indivisible Brahman. We have tosee all becomings as developments of the movement in our true self and this selfas one inhabiting all bodies and not our body only. We have to be consciously,in our relations with this world, what we really are, — this one self becomingeverything that we observe. All the movement, all energies, all forms, allhappenings we must see as those of our one and real self in many existences, asthe play of the Will and Knowledge and Delight of the Lord in Hisworld-existence.We shall then be delivered from egoism and desire and the sense of separateexistence and therefore from all grief and delusion and shrinking; for all griefis born of the shrinking of the ego from the contacts of existence, its sense offear, weakness, want, dislike, etc.; and this is born from the delusion ofseparate existence, the sense of being my separate ego exposed to all thesecontacts of so much that is not myself. Get rid of this, see oneness everywhere,be the One manifesting Himself in all creatures; ego will disappear; desire bornof the sense of not being this, not having that, will disappear; the freeinalienable delight of the One in His own existence will take the place ofdesire and its satisfactions and dissatisfactions.[4] Immortality will be yours,death born of division will be overcome. THE ACTIVE AND INACTIVE BRAHMAN6. The Inactive and the Active Brahman are simply two aspects of the one Self,the one Brahman, who is the Lord. It is He who has gone abroad in the movement.He maintains Himself free from all modifications in His inactive existence. Theinaction is the basis of the action and exists in the action; it is His freedomfrom all He does and becomes and in all He does and becomes. These are thepositive and negative poles of one indivisible consciousness. We embrace both inone quiescence and one movement, inseparable from each other, dependent on eachother. The quiescence exists relatively to the movement, the movement to thequiescence. He is beyond both. This is a different point of view from that ofthe identity of the Movement and Quiescence which are one in reality; itexpresses rather their relation in our consciousness once they are admitted as apractical necessity of that consciousness. It is obvious that we also bybecoming one with the Lord would share in this biune conscious existence.[5] VIDYA AND AVIDYA7. The knowledge of the One and the knowledge of the Many are a result of themovement of the one consciousness, which sees all things as One in theirtruth-Idea but differentiates them in their mentality and formal becoming. Ifthe mind (manīṣī) absorbs itself in God as the formal becoming (paribhū) andseparates itself from God in the true Idea (kavi), then it loses Vidya, theknowledge of the One, and has only the knowledge of the Many which becomes nolonger knowledge at all but ignorance, Avidya. This is the cause of the separateego-sense.Avidya is accepted by the Lord in the Mind (manīṣī) in order to developindividual relations to their utmost in all the possibilities of division andits consequences and then through these individual relations to come backindividually to the knowledge of the One in all. That knowledge has remained allalong unabrogated in the consciousness of the true seer or Kavi. This seer inourselves stands back from the mental thinker; the latter, thus separated, hasto conquer death and division by a developing experience as the individualInhabitant and finally to recover by the reunited knowledge of the One and theMany the state of Immortality. This is our proper course and not either todevote ourselves exclusively to the life of Avidya or to reject it entirely formotionless absorption in the One. BIRTH AND NON-BIRTH8. The reason for this double movement of the Thinker is that we are intended torealise immortality in the Birth. The self is uniform and undying and in itselfalways possesses immortality. It does not need to descend into Avidya and Birthto get that immortality of Non-Birth; for it possesses it always. It descends inorder to realise and possess it as the individual Brahman in the play ofworld-existence. It accepts Birth and Death, assumes the ego and then dissolvingthe ego by the recovery of unity realises itself as the Lord, the One, and Birthas only a becoming of the Lord in mental and formal being; this becoming is nowgoverned by the true sight of the Seer and, once this is done, becoming is nolonger inconsistent with Being, birth becomes a means and not an obstacle to theenjoyment of immortality by the lord of this formal habitation.[6] This is ourproper course and not to remain for ever in the chain of birth and death, nor toflee from birth into a pure non-becoming. The bondage does not consist in thephysical act of becoming, but in the persistence of the ignorant sense of theseparate ego. The Mind creates the chain and not the body. WORKS AND KNOWLEDGE9. The opposition between works and knowledge exists as long as works andknowledge are only of the egoistic mental character. Mental knowledge is nottrue knowledge; true knowledge is that which is based on the true sight, thesight of the Seer, of Surya, of the Kavi. Mental thought is not knowledge, it isa golden lid placed over the face of the Truth, the Sight, the divine Ideation,the Truth-Consciousness. When that is removed, sight replaces mental thought,the all-embracing truth-ideation mahas, veda, dṛṣṭi, replaces the fragmentarymental activity. True Buddhi (vijñāna) emerges from the dissipated action of theBuddhi which is all that is possible on the basis of the sense-mind, the Manas.Vijnana leads us to pure knowledge (jñāna), pure consciousness (cit). There werealise our entire identity with the Lord in all at the very roots of our being.But in Chit, Will and Seeing are one. Therefore in Vijnana or truth-ideationalso which comes luminously out of Chit, Will and Sight are combined and nolonger as in the mind separated from each other. Therefore, when we have thesight and live in the Truth-Consciousness, our will becomes the spontaneous lawof the truth in us and, knowing all its acts and their sense and objective,leads straight to the human goal, which was always the enjoyment of the Ananda,the Lord's delight in self-being, the state of Immortality. In our acts also webecome one with all beings and our life grows into a representation of oneness,truth and divine joy and no longer proceeds on the crooked path of egoism fullof division, error and stumbling. In a word, we attain to the object of ourexistence which is to manifest in itself whether on earth in a terrestrial bodyand against the resistance of Matter or in the worlds beyond or enter beyond allworld the glory of the divine Life and the divine Being.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] This is also the view of the Gita and generally accepted.[2] This, again, is the central standpoint of the Gita, which, however, admitsalso the renunciation of world-existence. The general trend of Vedantic thoughtwould accept therenunciation of desire and egoism as the essential but wouldhold that renunciation of egoism means the renunciation of all world-existence,for it sees desire and not Ananda as the cause of world-existence.[3] This truth would, again, be generally admitted, but not the conclusion thatis drawn from it.[4] In the ordinary view all this would be admitted, but the practicalpossibility of maintaining this state of consciousness and birth in the worldtogether would be doubted.[5] In the ordinary view the Jiva cannot exist in both at the same time; hisdissolution is into the Quiescence and not into unity with the Lord in theaction and inaction.[6] This is the stumbling-block to the ordinary philosophies which areimpregnated with the idea of the illusoriness of the world, even when they donot go the whole way with the Mayavada. Birth, they would say, is a play ofignorance, it cannot subsist along with entire knowledge."},{"pageContent":" THE KENA UPANISHAD"},{"pageContent":"THE KENA UPANISHADFIRST PART keneṣitaṁ patati preṣitaṁ manaḥ ǀkena prāṇaḥ prathamaḥ praiti yuktaḥ ǀkeneṣitāṁ vācamimāṁ vadanti ǀcakṣuḥ śrotraṁ ka u devo yunakti ǁ1.

Into the great kingdom of the Brahmavidyaeach enters by its own gates, follows its own path or detour, aims at its ownpoint of arrival. The Isha Upanishad and the Kena are both concerned with thesame grand problem, the winning of the state of Immortality, the relations ofthe divine, all-ruling, all-possessing Brahman to the world and to the humanconsciousness, the means of passing out of our present state of divided self,ignorance and suffering into the unity, the truth, the divine beatitude. As theIsha closes with the aspiration towards the supreme felicity, so the Kena closeswith the definition of Brahman as the Delight and the injunction to worship andseek after That as the Delight. Nevertheless there is a variation in thestarting-point, even in the standpoint, a certain sensible divergence in theattitude.For the precise subject of the two Upanishads is not identical. The Isha isconcerned with the whole problem of the world and life and works and humandestiny in their relation to the supreme truth of the Brahman. It embraces inits brief eighteen verses most of the fundamental problems of Life and scansthem swiftly with the idea of the supreme Self and its becomings, the supremeLord and His workings as the key that shall unlock all gates. The oneness of allexistences is its dominating note.The Kena Upanishad approaches a more restricted problem, starts with a moreprecise and narrow inquiry. It concerns itself only with the relation ofmind-consciousness to Brahman-consciousness and does not stray outside thestrict boundaries of its subject. The material world and the physical life aretaken for granted, they are hardly mentioned. But the material world and thephysical life exist for us only by virtue of our internal self and our internallife. According as our mental instruments represent to us the external world,according as our vital force in obedience to the mind deals with its impacts andobjects, so will be our outward life and existence. The world is for us, notfundamentally but practically at any rate, what our mind and senses declare itto be; life is what our mentality or at least our half-mentalised vital beingdetermines that it shall become. The question is asked by the Upanishad, whatthen are these mental instruments? what is this mental life which uses theexternal? Are they the last witnesses, the supreme and final power? Are mind andlife and body all or is this human existence only a veil of something greater,mightier, more remote and profound than itself?The Upanishad replies that there is such a greater existence behind, which is tothe mind and its instruments, to the life-force and its workings what they areto the material world. Matter does not know Mind, Mind knows Matter; it is onlywhen the creature embodied in Matter develops mind, becomes the mental beingthat he can know his mental self and know by that self Matter also in itsreality to Mind. So also Mind does not know That which is behind it, That knowsMind; and it is only when the being involved in Mind can deliver out of itsappearances his true Self that he can become That, know it as himself and by itknow also Mind in its reality to that which is more real than Mind. How to risebeyond the mind and its instruments, enter into himself, attain to the Brahmanbecomes then the supreme aim for the mental being, the all-important problem ofhis existence.For given that there is a more real existence than the mental existence, agreater life than the physical life, it follows that the lower life with itsforms and enjoyments which are all that men here ordinarily worship and pursue,can no longer be an object of desire for the awakened spirit. He must aspirebeyond; he must free himself from this world of death and mere phenomena tobecome himself in his true state of immortality beyond them. Then alone hereally exists when here in this mortal life itself he can free himself from themortal consciousness and know and be the Immortal and Eternal. Otherwise hefeels that he has lost himself, has fallen from his true salvation.But this Brahman-consciousness is not represented by the Upanishad as somethingquite alien to the mental and physical world, aloof from it and in no way activeupon it or concerned with its activities. On the contrary, it is the Lord andruler of all the world; the energies of the gods in the mortal consciousness areits energies; when they conquer and grow great, it is because Brahman has foughtand won. This world therefore is an inferior action, a superficialrepresentation of something infinitely greater, more perfect, more real thanitself.What is that something? It is the All-Bliss which is infinite being and immortalforce. It is that pure and utter bliss and not the desires and enjoyments ofthis world which men ought to worship and to seek. How to seek it is the onequestion that matters; to follow after it with all one’s being is the only truthand the only wisdom."},{"pageContent":"THE QUESTION. WHAT GODHEAD?Mind is the principal agent of the lower or phenomenal consciousness; vitalforce or the life-breath, speech and the five senses of knowledge are theinstruments of the mind. Prana, the life-force in the nervous system, is indeedthe one main instrument of our mental consciousness; for it is that by which themind receives the contacts of the physical world through the organs ofknowledge, sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste, and reacts upon its object byspeech and the other four organs of action; all these senses are dependent uponthe nervous life-force for their functioning. The Upanishad therefore begins bya query as to the final source or control of the activities of the Mind,Life-Force, Speech, Senses.The question is, kena, by whom or what? In the ancient conception of theuniverse our material existence is formed from the five elemental states ofMatter, the ethereal, aerial, fiery, liquid and solid; everything that has to dowith our material existence is called the elemental, adhibhūta. In this materialthere move non-material powers manifesting through the Mind-Force and Life-Forcethat work upon Matter, and these are called Gods or Devas; everything that hasto do with the working of the non-material in us is called adhidaiva, that whichpertains to the Gods. But above the non-material powers, containing them,greater than they is the Self or Spirit, ātman, and everything that has to dowith this highest existence in us is called the spiritual, adhyātma. For thepurpose of the Upanishads the adhidaiva is the subtle in us; it is that which isrepresented by Mind and Life as opposed to gross Matter; for in Mind and Life wehave the characteristic action of the Gods.The Upanishad is not concerned with the elemental, the adhibhūta; it isconcerned with the relation between the subtle existence and the spiritual, theadhidaiva and adhyātma. But the Mind, the Life, the speech, the senses aregoverned by cosmic powers, by Gods, by Indra, Vayu, Agni. Are these subtlecosmic powers the beginning of existence, the true movers of mind and life, oris there some superior unifying force, one in itself behind them all?By whom or what is the mind missioned and sent on its errand so that it falls onits object like an arrow shot by a skilful archer at its predetermined mark,like a messenger, an envoy sent by his master to a fixed place for a fixedobject? What is it within us or without us that sends forth the mind on itserrand? What guides it to its object?Then there is the life-force, the Prana, that works in our vital being andnervous system. The Upanishad speaks of it as the first or supreme Breath;elsewhere in the sacred writings it is spoken of as the chief Breath or theBreath of the mouth, mukhya, āsanya; it is that which carries in it the Word,the creative expression. In the body of man there are said to be five workingsof the life-force called the five Pranas. One specially termed Prana moves inthe upper part of the body and is preeminently the breath of life, because itbrings the universal life-force into the physical system and gives it there tobe distributed. A second in the lower part of the trunk, termed Apana, is thebreath of death; for it gives away the vital force out of the body. A third, theSamana, regulates the interchange of these two forces at their meeting-place,equalises them and is the most important agent in maintaining the equilibrium ofthe vital forces and their functions. A fourth, the Vyana, pervasive,distributes the vital energies throughout the body. A fifth, the Udana, movesupward from the body to the crown of the head and is a regular channel ofcommunication between the physical life and the greater life of the spirit. Noneof these are the first or supreme Breath, although the Prana most nearlyrepresents it; the Breath to which so much importance is given in theUpanishads, is the pure life-force itself, — first, because all the others aresecondary to it, born from it and only exist as its special functions. It isimaged in the Veda as the Horse; its various energies are the forces that drawthe chariots of the Gods. The Vedic image is recalled by the choice of the termsemployed in the Upanishad, yukta, yoked, praiti, goes forward, as a horse drivenby the charioteer advances in its path.Who then has yoked this life-force to the many workings of existence or by whatpower superior to itself does it move forward in its paths? For it is notprimal, self-existent or its own agent. We are conscious of a power behind whichguides, drives, controls, uses it.The force of the vital breath enables us to bring up and speed outward from thebody this speech that we use to express, to throw out into a world of action andnew-creation the willings and thought-formations of the mind. It is propelled byVayu, the life-breath; it is formed by Agni, the secret will-force and fieryshaping energy in the mind and body. But these are the agents. Who or what isthe secret Power that is behind them, the master of the word that men speak, itsreal former and the origin of that which expresses itself?The ear hears the sound, the eye sees the form; but hearing and vision areparticular operations of the life-force in us used by the mind in order to putitself into communication with the world in which the mental being dwells and tointerpret it in the forms of sense. The life-force shapes them, the mind usesthem, but something other than the life-force and the mind enables them to shapeand to use their objects and their instruments. What God sets eye and ear totheir workings? Not Surya, the God of light, not Ether and his regions; forthese are only conditions of vision and hearing.The Gods combine, each bringing his contribution, the operations of the physicalworld that we observe as of the mental world that is our means of observation;but the whole universal action is one, not a sum of fortuitous atoms; it is one,arranged in its parts, combined in its multiple functionings by virtue of asingle conscient existence which can never be constructed or put together(akṛta) but is for ever anterior to all these workings. The Gods work only bythis Power anterior to themselves, live only by its life, think only by itsthought, act only for its purposes. We look into ourselves and all things andbecome aware of it there, an “I”, an “Is”, a Self, which is other, firmer,vaster than any separate or individual being.But since it is not anything that the mind can make its object or the sensesthrow into form for the mind, what then is it — or who? What absolute Spirit?What one, supreme and eternal Godhead? Ko devaḥ."},{"pageContent":"THE SUPRAMENTAL GODHEADThe eternal question has been put which turns man’s eyes away from the visibleand the outward to that which is utterly within, away from the little known thathe has become to the vast unknown he is behind these surfaces and must yet growinto and be, because that is his Reality and out of all masquerade of phenomenonand becoming the Real Being must eventually deliver itself. The human soul onceseized by this compelling direction can no longer be satisfied with lookingforth at mortalities and seemings through those doors of the mind and sensewhich the Self-existent has made to open outward upon a world of forms; it isdriven to gaze inward into a new world of realities.Here in the world that man knows, he possesses something which, howeverimperfect and insecure, he yet values. For he aims at and to some extent heprocures enlarged being, increasing knowledge, more and more joy andsatisfaction and these things are so precious to him that for what he can get ofthem he is ready to pay the price of continual suffering from the shock of theiropposites. If then he has to abandon what he here pursues and clasps, there mustbe a far more powerful attraction drawing him to the Beyond, a secret offer ofsomething so great as to be a full reward for all possible renunciation that canbe demanded of him here. This is offered, — not an enlarged becoming, butinfinite being; not always relative piecings of knowledge mistaken in their hourfor the whole of knowledge, but the possession of our essential consciousnessand the flood of its luminous realities; not partial satisfactions, but thedelight. In a word, Immortality.The language of the Upanishad makes it strikingly clear that it is nometaphysical abstraction, no void Silence, no indeterminate Absolute which isoffered to the soul that aspires, but rather the absolute of all that ispossessed by it here in the relative world of its sojourning. All here in themental is a growing light, consciousness and life; all there in the supramentalis an infinite life, light and consciousness. That which is here shadowed, isthere found; the incomplete here is there the fulfilled. The Beyond is not anannullation, but a transfiguration of all that we are here in our world offorms; it is sovran Mind of this mind, secret Life of this life, the absoluteSense which supports and justifies our limited senses.We renounce ourselves in order to find ourselves; for in the mental life thereis only a seeking, but never an ultimate finding till mind is overpassed.Therefore there is behind all our mentality a perfection of ourselves whichappears to us as an antinomy and contrast to what we are. For here we are aconstant becoming; there we possess our eternal being. Here we conceive ofourselves as a changeful consciousness developed and always developing by ahampered effort in the drive of Time; there we are an immutable consciousness ofwhich Time is not the master but the instrument as well as the field of all thatit creates and watches. Here we live in an organisation of mortal consciousnesswhich takes the form of a transient world; there we are liberated into theharmonies of an infinite self-seeing which knows all world in the light of theeternal and immortal. The Beyond is our reality; that is our plenitude; that isthe absolute satisfaction of our self-existence. It is immortality and it is“That Delight”.Here in our imprisoned mentality the ego strives to be master and possessor ofits inner field and its outer environment, yet cannot hold anything to enjoy it,because it is not possible really to possess what is not-self to us. But therein the freedom of the eternal our self-existence possesses without strife by thesufficient fact that all things are itself. Here is the apparent man, there thereal man, the Purusha: here are gods, there is the Divine: here is the attemptto exist, Life flowering out of an all-devouring death, there Existence itselfand a dateless immortality.The answer that is thus given is involved in the very form of the originalquestion. The Truth behind Mind, Life, Sense must be that which controls byexceeding it; it is the Lord, the all-possessing Deva. This was the conclusionat which the Isha Upanishad arrived by the synthesis of all existences; the Kenaarrives at it by the antithesis of one governing self-existence to all this thatexists variously by another power of being than its own. Each follows its ownmethod for the resolution of all things into the one Reality, but the conclusionis identical. It is the All-possessing and All-enjoying, who is reached by therenunciation of separate being, separate possession and separate delight.But the Isha addresses itself to the awakened seeker; it begins therefore withthe all-inhabiting Lord, proceeds to the all-becoming Self and returns to theLord as the Self of the cosmic movement, because it has to justify works to theseeker of the Uncreated and to institute a divine life founded on the joy ofimmortality and on the unified consciousness of the individual made one with theuniversal. The Kena addresses itself to the soul still attracted by the externallife, not yet wholly awakened nor wholly a seeker; it begins therefore with theBrahman as the Self beyond Mind and proceeds to the Brahman as the hidden Lordof all our mental and vital activities, because it has to point this soul upwardbeyond its apparent and outward existence. But the two opening chapters of theKena only state less widely from this other viewpoint the Isha’s doctrine of theSelf and its becomings; the last two repeat in other terms of thought the Isha’sdoctrine of the Lord and His movement."},{"pageContent":"THE ETERNAL BEYOND THE MINDThe Upanishad first affirms the existence of this profounder, vaster, morepuissant consciousness behind our mental being. That, it affirms, is Brahman.Mind, Life, Sense, Speech are not the utter Brahman; they are only inferiormodes and external instruments. Brahman-consciousness is our real self and ourtrue existence.Mind and body are not our real self; they are mutable formations or images whichwe go on constructing in the drive of Time as a result of the mass of our pastenergies. For although those energies seem to us to lie dead in the past becausetheir history is behind us, yet are they still existent in their mass and alwaysactive in the present and the future.Neither is the ego-function our real self. Ego is only a faculty put forward bythe discriminative mind to centralise round itself the experiences of thesense-mind and to serve as a sort of lynch-pin in the wheel which keeps togetherthe movement. It is no more than an instrument, although it is true that so longas we are limited by our normal mentality, we are compelled by the nature ofthat mentality and the purpose of the instrument to mistake our ego-function forour very self.Neither is it the memory that constitutes our real self. Memory is anotherinstrument, a selective instrument for the practical management of our consciousactivities. The ego-function uses it as a rest and support so as to preserve thesense of continuity without which our mental and vital activities could not beorganised for a spacious enjoyment by the individual. But even our mental selfcomprises and is influenced in its being by a host of things which are notpresent to our memory, are subconscious and hardly grasped at all by our surfaceexistence. Memory is essential to the continuity of the ego-sense, but it is notthe constituent of the ego-sense, still less of the being.Neither is moral personality our real self. It is only a changing formation, apliable mould framed and used by our subjective life in order to give someappearance of fixity to the constantly mutable becoming which our mentallimitations successfully tempt us to call ourselves.Neither is the totality of that mutable conscious becoming, although enriched byall that subconsciously underlies it, our real self. What we become is a fluentmass of life, a stream of experience pouring through time, a flux of Nature uponthe crest of which our mentality rides. What we are is the eternal essence ofthat life, the immutable consciousness that bears the experience, the immortalsubstance of Nature and mentality.For behind all and dominating all that we become and experience, there issomething that originates, uses, determines, enjoys, yet is not changed by itsorigination, not affected by its instruments, not determined by itsdeterminations, not worked upon by its enjoyings. What that is, we cannot knowunless we go behind the veil of our mental being which knows only what isaffected, what is determined, what is worked upon, what is changed. The mind canonly be aware of that as something which we indefinably are, not as somethingwhich it definably knows. For the moment our mentality tries to fix thissomething, it loses itself in the flux and the movement, grasps at parts,functions, fictions, appearances which it uses as planks of safety in the welteror tries to cut out a form from the infinite and say, “This is I.” In the wordsof the Veda, “when the mind approaches That and studies it, That vanishes.”But behind the Mind is this other or Brahman-conscious-ness, Mind of our mind,Sense of our senses, Speech of our speech, Life of our life. Arriving at that,we arrive at Self; we can draw back from mind the image into Brahman theReality.But what differentiates that real from this apparent self? Or — since we can sayno more than we have said already in the way of definition, since we can onlyindicate that “That” is not what “this” is, but is the mentally inexpressibleabsolute of all that is here, — what is the relation of this phenomenon to thatreality? For it is the question of the relation that the Upanishad makes itsstarting-point; its opening question assumes that there is a relation and thatthe reality originates and governs the phenomenon.Obviously, Brahman is not a thing subject to our mind, senses, speech orlife-force; it is no object seen, heard, expressed, sensed, formed by thought,nor any state of body or mind that we become in the changing movement of thelife. But the thought of the Upanishad attempts to awaken deeper echoes from ourgulfs than this obvious denial of the mental and sensuous objectivity of theBrahman. It affirms that not only is it not an object of mind or a formation oflife, but it is not even dependent on our mind, life and senses for the exerciseof its lordship and activity. It is that which does not think by the mind, doesnot live by the life, does not sense by the senses, does not find expression inthe speech, but rather makes these things themselves the object of its superior,all-comprehending, all-knowing consciousness.Brahman thinks out the mind by that which is beyond mind; it sees the sight andhears the hearing by that absolute vision and audition which are not phenomenaland instrumental but direct and inherent; it forms our expressive speech out ofits creative word; it speeds out this life we cling to from that eternalmovement of its energy which is not parceled out into forms but has always thefreedom of its own inexhaustible infinity.Thus the Upanishad begins its reply to its own question. It first describesBrahman as Mind of the mind, Sight of the sight, Hearing of the hearing, Speechof the speech, Life of the life. It then takes up each of these expressions andthrows them successively into a more expanded form so as to suggest a moredefinite and ample idea of their meaning, so far as that can be done by words.To the expression “Mind of the mind” corresponds the expanded phrase “That whichthinks not with the mind, that by which the mind is thought” and so on with eachof the original descriptive expressions to the closing definition of the Lifebehind this life as “That which breathes not with the life-breath, that by whichthe life-power is brought forward into its movement”.And each of these exegetic lines is emphasised by the reiterated admonition,“That Brahman seek to know and not this which men follow after here.” NeitherMind, Life, Sense and Speech nor their objects and expressions are the Realitywhich we have to know and pursue. True knowledge is of That which forms theseinstruments for us but is itself independent of their utilities. True possessionand enjoyment is of that which, while it creates these objects of our pursuit,itself makes nothing the object of its pursuit and passion, but is eternallysatisfied with all things in the joy of its immortal being."},{"pageContent":"THE SUPREME WORDThe Upanishad, reversing the usual order of our logical thought which would putMind and Sense first or Life first and Speech last as a subordinate function,begins its negative description of Brahman with an explanation of the verystriking phrase, Speech of our speech. And we can see that it means a Speechbeyond ours, an absolute expression of which human language is only a shadow andas if an artificial counterfeit. What idea underlies this phrase of theUpanishad and this precedence given to the faculty of speech?Continually, in studying the Upanishads, we have to divest ourselves of modernnotions and to realise as closely as possible the associations that lay behindthe early Vedantic use of words. We must recollect that in the Vedic system theWord was the creatrix; by the Word Brahma creates the forms of the universe.Moreover, human speech at its highest merely attempts to recover by revelationand inspiration an absolute expression of Truth which already exists in theInfinite above our mental comprehension. Equally, then, must that Word be aboveour power of mental construction.All creation is expression by the Word; but the form which is expressed is onlya symbol or representation of the thing which is. We see this in human speechwhich only presents to the mind a mental form of the object; but the object itseeks to express is itself only a form or presentation of another Reality. ThatReality is Brahman. Brahman expresses by the Word a form or presentation ofhimself in the objects of sense and consciousness which constitute the universe,just as the human word expresses a mental image of those objects. That Word iscreative in a deeper and more original sense than human speech and with a powerof which the utmost creativeness of human speech can be only a far-off andfeeble analogy.The word used here for utterance means literally a raising up to confront themind. Brahman, says the Upanishad, is that which cannot be so raised up beforethe mind by speech.Human speech, as we see, raises up only the presentation of a presentation, themental figure of an object which is itself only a figure of the sole Reality,Brahman. It has indeed a power of new creation, but even that power only extendsto the creation of new mental images, that is to say, of adaptive formationsbased upon previous mental images. Such a limited power gives no idea of theoriginal creative puissance which the old thinkers attributed to the divineWord.If, however, we go a little deeper below the surface, we shall arrive at a powerin human speech which does give us a remote image of the original creative Word.We know that vibration of sound has the power to create — and to destroy —forms; this is a commonplace of modern Science. Let us suppose that behind allforms there has been a creative vibration of sound.Next, let us examine the relation of human speech to sound in general. We see atonce that speech is only a particular application of the principle of sound, avibration made by pressure of the breath in its passage through the throat andmouth. At first, beyond doubt, it must have been formed naturally andspontaneously to express the sensations and emotions created by an object oroccurrence and only afterwards seized upon by the mind to express first the ideaof the object and then ideas about the object. The value of speech wouldtherefore seem to be only representative and not creative.But, in fact, speech is creative. It creates forms of emotion, mental images andimpulses of action. The ancient Vedic theory and practice extended this creativeaction of speech by the use of the Mantra. The theory of the Mantra is that itis a word of power born out of the secret depths of our being where it has beenbrooded upon by a deeper consciousness than the mental, framed in the heart andnot originally constructed by the intellect, held in the mind, againconcentrated on by the waking mental consciousness and then thrown out silentlyor vocally — the silent word is perhaps held to be more potent than the spoken —precisely for the work of creation. The Mantra can not only create newsubjective states in ourselves, alter our psychical being, reveal knowledge andfaculties we did not before possess, can not only produce similar results inother minds than that of the user, but can produce vibrations in the mental andvital atmosphere which result in effects, in actions and even in the productionof material forms on the physical plane.As a matter of fact, even ordinarily, even daily and hourly we do produce by theword within us thought-vibrations, thought-forms which result in correspondingvital and physical vibrations, act upon ourselves, act upon others, and end inthe indirect creation of actions and of forms in the physical world. Man isconstantly acting upon man both by the silent and the spoken word and he so actsand creates, though less directly and powerfully, even in the rest of Nature.But because we are stupidly engrossed with the external forms and phenomena ofthe world and do not trouble to examine its subtle and non-physical processes,we remain ignorant of all this field of science behind.The Vedic use of the Mantra is only a conscious utilisation of this secret powerof the word. And if we take the theory that underlies it together with ourprevious hypothesis of a creative vibration of sound behind every formation, weshall begin to understand the idea of the original creative Word. Let us supposea conscious use of the vibrations of sound which will produce correspondingforms or changes of form. But Matter is only, in the ancient view, the lowest ofthe planes of existence. Let us realise then that a vibration of sound on thematerial plane presupposes a corresponding vibration on the vital without whichit could not have come into play; that again presupposes a correspondingoriginative vibration on the mental; the mental presupposes a correspondingoriginative vibration on the supramental at the very root of things. But amental vibration implies thought and perception and a supramental vibrationimplies a supreme vision and discernment. All vibration of sound on that higherplane is, then, instinct with and expressive of this supreme discernment of atruth in things and is at the same time creative, instinct with a supreme powerwhich casts into forms the truth discerned and eventually, descending from planeto plane, reproduces it in the physical form or object created in Matter byetheric sound. Thus we see that the theory of creation by the Word which is theabsolute expression of the Truth, and the theory of the material creation bysound-vibration in the ether correspond and are two logical poles of the sameidea. They both belong to the same ancient Vedic system.This, then, is the supreme Word, Speech of our speech. It is vibration of pureExistence, instinct with the perceptive and originative power of infinite andomnipotent consciousness, shaped by the Mind behind mind into the inevitableword of the Truth of things; out of whatever substance on whatever plane, theform or physical expression emerges by its creative agency. The Supermind usingthe Word is the creative Logos.The Word has its seed-sounds — suggesting the eternal syllable of the Veda, A M,and the seed-sounds of the Tantriks — which carry in them the principles ofthings; it has its forms which stand behind the revelatory and inspired speechthat comes to man’s supreme faculties, and these compel the forms of things inthe universe; it has its rhythms, — for it is no disordered vibration, but movesout into great cosmic measures, — and according to the rhythm is the law,arrangement, harmony, processes of the world it builds. Life itself is a rhythmof God.But what is it that is expressed or raised up before the mental consciousness bythe Word in the phenomenal world? Not Brahman, but truths, forms and phenomenaof Brahman. Brahman is not, cannot be expressed by the Word; he does not use theword here to express his very self, but is known only to his own self-awareness.And even the truths of himself that stand behind the forms of cosmic things arein their true reality always self-expressed to his eternal vision in a higherthan the mental vibration, a rhythm and voice of themselves that is their ownvery soul of movement. Speech, a lesser thing, creates, expresses, but is itselfonly a creation and expression. Brahman is not expressed by speech, but speechis itself expressed by Brahman. And that which expresses speech in us, brings itup out of our consciousness with its strivings to raise up the truth of thingsto our mind, is Brahman himself as the Word, a Thing that is in the supremesuperconscience. That Word, Speech of our speech, is in its essence of Power theEternal himself and in its supreme movements a part of his very form andeverlasting spiritual body, brahmaṇo rūpam.Therefore it is not the happenings and phenomena of the world that we have toaccept finally as our object of pursuit, but That which brings out from itselfthe Word by which they were thrown into form for our observation by theconsciousness and for our pursuit by the will. In other words, the supremeExistence that has originated all.Human speech is only a secondary expression and at its highest a shadow of thedivine Word, of the seed-sounds, the satisfying rhythms, the revealing forms ofsound that are the omniscient and omnipotent speech of the eternal Thinker,Harmonist, Creator. The highest inspired speech to which the human mind canattain, the word most unanalysably expressive of supreme truth, the mostpuissant syllable or mantra can only be its far-off representation."},{"pageContent":"THE NECESSITY OF SUPERMINDAs the Upanishad asserts a speech behind this speech, which is the expressiveaspect of the Brahman-consciousness, so it asserts a Mind behind this mind whichis its cognitive aspect. And as we asked ourselves what could be the rationalbasis for the theory of the divine Word superior to our speech, so we have nowto ask ourselves what can be the rational basis for this theory of a cognitivefaculty or principle superior to Mind. We may say indeed that if we grant adivine Word creative of all things, we must also grant a divine Mind cognitiveof the Word and of all that it expresses. But this is not a sufficientfoundation; for the theory of the divine Word presents itself only as a rationalpossibility. A cognition higher than Mind presents itself on the other hand as anecessity which arises from the very nature of Mind itself, a necessity fromwhich we cannot logically escape.In the ancient system which admitted the soul’s survival of the body, Mind wasthe man, in a very profound and radical sense of the phrase. It is not only thatthe human being is the one reasoning animal upon earth, the thinking race; he isessentially the mental being in a terrestrial body, the manu. Quite apart fromthe existence of a soul or self one in all creatures, the body is not even thephenomenal self of man; the physical life also is not himself; both may bedissolved, man will persist. But if the mental being also is dissolved, man asman ceases to be; for this is his centre and the nodus of his organism.On the contrary, according to the theory of a material evolution upheld bymodern Science, man is only Matter that has developed mind by an increasingsensibility to the shocks of its environment; and Matter being the basis ofexistence, there is nothing, except the physical elements, that can survive thedissolution of the body. But this formula is at most the obverse and inferiorside of a much larger truth. Matter could not develop Mind if in or behind theforce that constitutes physical forms there were not already a principle of Mindstriving towards self- manifestation. The will to enlighten and consciouslygovern the life and the form must have been already existent in that whichappears to us inconscient; it must have been there before mind was evolved. For,if there were no such necessity of Mind in Matter, if the stuff of mentalitywere not there already and the will to mentalise, Mind could not possibly havecome into being out of inconscient substance.But in the mere chemical elements which go to constitute material forms or inelectricity or in any other purely physical factor, whatever unconscious will orsensation they may be possessed by or possess, we can discover nothing whichcould explain the emergence of conscious sensation, which could constitute awill towards the evolution of thought or which could impose the necessity ofsuch an evolution on inconscient physical substance. It is not then in the formof Matter itself, but in the Force which is at work in Matter, that we must seekthe origin of Mind. That Force must either be itself conscient or contain thegrain of mental consciousness inherent in its being and therefore thepotentiality and indeed the necessity of its emergence. This imprisonedconsciousness, though originally absorbed in the creation first of forms andthen of physical relations and reactions between physical forms, must still haveheld in itself from the beginning, however long kept back and suppressed, a willto the ultimate enlightenment of these relations by the creation ofcorresponding conscious or mental values. Mind is then a concealed necessitywhich the subconscient holds in itself from the commencement of things; it isthe thing that must emerge once the attractions and repulsions of Matter beginto be established; it is the suppressed secret and cause of the reactions oflife in the metal, plant and animal.If on the other hand we say that Mind in some such secret and suppressed form isnot already existent in Matter, we must then suppose that it exists outsideMatter and embraces it or enters into it. We must suppose a mental plane ofexistence which presses upon the physical and tends to possess it. In that casethe mental being would be in its origin an entity which is formed outside thematerial world; but it prepares in that world bodies which become progressivelymore and more able to house and express Mind. We may image it forming, enteringinto and possessing the body, breaking into it, as it were, — as the Purusha inthe Aitareya Upanishad is said to form the body and then to enter in by breakingopen a door in Matter. Man would in this view be a mental being incarnate in theliving body who at its dissolution leaves it with full possession of hismentality.The two theories are far from being incompatible with each other; they can beviewed as complements forming a single truth. For the involution of Mind, itslatency in the material Force of the physical universe and in all its movementsdoes not preclude the existence of a mental world beyond and above the reign ofthe physical principle. In fact, the emergence of such a latent Mind might welldepend upon and would certainly profit by the aid and pressure of forces from asupra-physical kingdom, a mental plane of existence.There are always two possible views of the universe. The one supposes, withmodern Science, Matter to be the beginning of things and studies everything asan evolution from Matter; or, if not Matter, then, with the Sankhya philosophy,an indeterminate inconscient active Force or Prakriti of which even mind andreason are mechanical operations, — the conscious soul, if any exists, being aquite different and, although conscient, yet inactive entity. The other supposesthe conscious soul, the Purusha, to be the material as well as the cause of theuniverse and Prakriti to be only its Shakti or the Force of its conscious beingwhich operates upon itself as the material of forms.[1] The latter is the viewof the Upanishads. Certainly, if we study the material world only, excluding allevidence of other planes as a dream or a hallucination, if we equally excludeall evidence of operations in mind which exceed the material limitation andstudy only its ordinary equation with Matter, we must necessarily accept thetheory of Matter as the origin and as the indispensable basis and continent.Otherwise, we shall be irresistibly led towards the early Vedantic conclusions.However this may be, even from the standpoint of the sole material world Man inthe substance of his manhood is a mind occupying and using the life of the body— a mind that is greater than the Matter in which it has emerged. He is thehighest present expression of the will in the material universe; the Force thathas built up the worlds, so far as we are able to judge of its intention fromits actual operations as we see them in their present formula upon earth,arrives in him at the thing it was seeking to express. It has brought out thehidden principle of Mind that now operates consciously and intelligently on thelife and the body. Man is the satisfaction of the necessity which Nature boresecretly in her from the very commencement of her works; he is the highestpossible Name or Numen on this planet; he is the realised terrestrial godhead.But all this is true only if we assume that for Nature’s terrestrial activitiesMind is the ultimate formula. In reality and when we study more deeply thephenomena of consciousness, the facts of mentality, the secret tendency,aspiration and necessity of man’s own nature, we see that he cannot be thehighest term. He is the highest realised here and now; he is not the highestrealisable. As there is something below him, so there is something, if even onlya possibility, above. As physical Nature concealed a secret beyond herself whichin him she has released into creation, so he too conceals a secret beyondhimself which he in turn must deliver to the light. That is his destiny.This must necessarily be so because Mind too is not the first principle ofthings and therefore cannot be their last possibility. As Matter contained Lifein itself, contained it as its own secret necessity and had to be delivered ofthat birth, and as Life contained Mind in itself, contained it as its own secretnecessity and had to be delivered of the birth it held, so Mind too contains initself that which is beyond itself, contains it as its own secret necessity andpresses to be delivered, it also, of this supreme birth.What is the rational necessity which forbids us to suppose Mind to be Nature’slast birth and compels us to posit something beyond it of which itself is theindication? A consideration of the nature and working of mentality supplies uswith the answer. For mentality is composed of three principal elements, thought,will and sensation. Sensation may be described as an attempt of dividedconsciousness to seize upon its object and enjoy it, thought as its attempt toseize upon the truth of the object and possess it, will as its attempt to seizeupon the potentiality of the object and use it. At least these three things aresuch an attempt in their essentiality, in their instinct, in their subconsciouspurpose. But obviously the attempt is imperfect in its conditions and itssuccess; its very terms indicate a barrier, a gulf, an incapacity. As Life islimited and hampered by the conditions of its synthesis with Matter, so Mind islimited and hampered by the conditions of its synthesis with Life in Matter.Neither Matter nor Life has found anything proper to their own formula whichcould help to conquer or sufficiently expand its limitations; they have beencompelled each to call in a new principle, Matter to call into itself Life, Lifeto call into itself Mind. Mind also is not able to find anything proper to itsown formula which can conquer or sufficiently expand the limitations imposedupon its workings; Mind also has to call in a new principle beyond itself, freerthan itself and more powerful.In other words, Mind does not exhaust the possibilities of consciousness andtherefore cannot be its last and highest expression. Mind tries to arrive atTruth and succeeds only in touching it imperfectly with a veil between; theremust be in the nature of things a faculty or principle which sees the Truthunveiled, an eternal faculty of knowledge which corresponds to the eternal factof the Truth. There is, says the Veda, such a principle; it is theTruth-Consciousness which sees the Truth directly and is in possession of itspontaneously. Mind labours to effect the will in it and succeeds only inaccomplishing partially, with difficulty and insecurely the potentiality atwhich it works; there must be a faculty or principle of conscious effectiveforce which corresponds to the unconscious automatic principle ofself-fulfilment in Nature, and this principle must be sought for in the form ofconsciousness that exceeds Mind. Mind, finally, aspires to seize and enjoy theessential delight-giving quality, the rasa of things, but it succeeds only inattaining to it indirectly, holding it in an imperfect grasp and enjoying itexternally and fragmentarily; there must be a principle which can attaindirectly, hold rightly, enjoy intimately and securely. There is, says the Veda,an eternal Bliss-consciousness which corresponds to the eternal rasa oressential delight-giving quality of all experience and is not limited by theinsecure approximations of the sense in Mind.If, then, such a deeper principle of consciousness exists, it must be that andnot mind which is the original and fundamental intention concealed in Nature andwhich eventually and somewhere must emerge. But is there any reason forsupposing that it must emerge here and in Mind, as Mind has emerged in Life andLife in Matter? We answer in the affirmative because Mind has in itself, howeverobscurely, that tendency, that aspiration and, at bottom, that necessity. Thereis one law from the lowest to the highest. Matter, when we examine it closely,proves to be instinct with the stuff of Life — the vibrations, actions andreactions, attractions and repulsions, contractions and expansions, thetendencies of combination, formation and growth, the seekings and responseswhich are the very substance of life; but the visible principle of life can onlyemerge when the necessary material conditions have been prepared which willpermit it to organise itself in Matter. So also Life is instinct with the stuffof Mind, abounds with an unconscious[2] sensation, will, intelligence, but thevisible principle of Mind can only emerge when the necessary vital conditionshave been prepared which will permit it to organise itself in living Matter.Mind too is instinct with the stuff of supermind — sympathies, unities,intuitions, emergences of pre-existent knowledge, instincts, imperative lightsand movements, inherent self-effectivities of will which disguise themselves ina mental form; but the visible principle of supermind can only emerge when thenecessary mental conditions are prepared which will permit it to organise itselfin man, the mental living creature.This necessary preparation is proceeding in human development as thecorresponding preparations were developed in the lower stages of the evolution,— with the same gradations, retardations, inequalities; but still it is moreenlightened, increasingly self-conscious, nearer to a conscious sureness. Andthe very fact that this progress is attended by less absorption in the detail,less timidity of error, a less conservative attachment to the step gainedsuggests as much as it contradicts the hope and almost the assurance that whenthe new principle emerges it will not be by the creation of a new and quitedifferent type which, separated after its creation, will leave the rest ofmankind in the same position to it as are the animals to man, but, if not by theelevation of humanity as a whole to a higher level, yet by an opening of thegreater possibility to all of the race who have the will to rise. For Man, firstamong Nature’s children, has shown the capacity to change himself by his owneffort and the conscious aspiration to transcend.These considerations justify to the reason the idea of a Mind beyond our mind,but only as a final evolution out of Matter. The Upanishad, however, enthronesit as the already existing creator and ruler of Mind; it is a secret principlealready conscient and not merely contained inconsciently in the very stuff ofthings. But this is the natural conclusion — even apart from spiritualexperience — from the nature of the supramental principle. For it is at itshighest an eternal knowledge, will, bliss and conscious being and it is morereasonable to conclude that it is eternally conscious, though we are notconscious of it, and the source of the universe, than that it is eternallyinconscient and only becomes conscient in Time as a result of the universe. Ourinconscience of it is no proof that it is inconscient of us: and yet our ownincapacity is the only real basis left for the denial of an eternal Mind beyondmind superior to its creations and originative of the cosmos.All other foundations for the rejection of this ancient wisdom have disappearedor are disappearing before the increasing light of modern knowledge.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] For example, the Aitareya Upanishad which shows us the Atman or Self usingthe Purusha as that in which all the operations of Nature are formed.[2] I use the language of the materialist Haeckel in spite of its paradoxicalform."},{"pageContent":"MIND AND SUPERMINDWe arrive then at this affirmation of an all-cognitive principle superior toMind and exceeding it in nature, scope and capacity. For the Upanishad affirms aMind beyond mind as the result of intuition and spiritual experience and itsexistence is equally a necessary conclusion from the facts of the cosmicevolution. What then is this Mind beyond mind? how does it function? or by whatmeans shall we arrive at the knowledge of it or possess it?The Upanishad asserts about this supreme cognitive principle, first, that it isbeyond the reach of mind and the senses; secondly, that it does not itself thinkwith the mind; thirdly, that it is that by which mind itself is thought ormentalised; fourthly, that it is the very nature or description of theBrahman-consciousness.When we say, however, that “Mind of mind” is the nature or description of theBrahman-consciousness, we must not forget that the absolute Brahman in itself isheld to be unknowable and therefore beyond description. It is unknowable, notbecause it is a void and capable of no description except that of nothingness,nor because, although positive in existence, it has no content or quality, butbecause it is beyond all things that our present instruments of knowledge canconceive and because the methods of ideation and expression proper to ourmentality do not apply to it. It is the absolute of all things that we know andof each thing that we know and yet nothing nor any sum of things can exhaust orcharacterise its essential being. For its manner of being is other than thatwhich we call existence; its unity resists all analysis, its multiple infinitiesexceed every synthesis. Therefore it is not in its absolute essentiality that itcan be described as Mind of the mind, but in its fundamental nature in regard toour mental existence. Brahman-consciousness is the eternal outlook of theAbsolute upon the relative.But even of this outlook we may say that it is beyond the reach of mind andspeech and senses. Yet mind, speech and senses seem to be our only availablemeans for acquiring and expressing knowledge. Must we not say then that thisBrahman-consciousness also is unknowable and that we can never hope to know itor possess it while in this body? Yet the Upanishad commands us to know thisBrahman and by knowledge to possess it — for the knowledge intended by the wordsviddhi, avedīt, is a knowledge that discovers and takes possession, — and itdeclares later on that it is here, in this body and on this earth that we mustthus possess Brahman in knowledge, otherwise great is the perdition. A good dealof confusion has been brought into the interpretation of this Upanishad by a tootrenchant dealing with the subtlety of its distinctions between the knowabilityand the unknowability of the Brahman. We must therefore try to observe exactlywhat the Upanishad says and especially to seize the whole of its drift bysynthetic intuition rather than cut up its meaning so as to make it subject toour logical mentality.The Upanishad sets out by saying that this Ruler of the mind, senses, speech andlife is Mind of our mind, Life of our life, Sense of our senses, Speech of ourspeech; and it then proceeds to explain what it intends by these challengingphrases. But it introduces between the description and the explanation a warningthat neither the description nor the explanation must be pushed beyond theirproper limits or understood as more than guide-posts pointing us towards ourgoal. For neither Mind, Speech nor Sense can travel to the Brahman; thereforeBrahman must be beyond all these things in its very nature, otherwise it wouldbe attainable by them in their function. The Upanishad, although it is about toteach of the Brahman, yet affirms, “we know It not, we cannot distinguish howone should teach of it.” The two Sanskrit words that are here used, vidmaḥ andvijānīmaḥ, seem to indicate the one a general grasp and possession in knowledge,the other a total and exact comprehension in whole and detail, by synthesis andanalysis. The reason of this entire inability is next given, “because Brahman isother than the known and It is there over the unknown”, possessing it and, as itwere, presiding over it. The known is all that we grasp and possess by ourpresent mentality; it is all that is not the supreme Brahman but only form andphenomenon of it to our sense and mental cognition. The unknown is that which isbeyond the known and though unknown is not unknowable if we can enlarge ourfaculties or attain to others that we do not yet possess.Yet the Upanishad next proceeds to maintain and explain its first descriptionand to enjoin on us the knowledge of the Brahman which it so describes. Thiscontradiction is not at once reconciled; it is only in the second chapter thatthe difficulty is solved and only in the fourth that the means of knowledge areindicated. The contradiction arises from the nature of our knowledge itselfwhich is a relation between the consciousness that seeks and the consciousnessthat is sought; where that relation disappears, knowledge is replaced by sheeridentity. In what we call existence, the highest knowledge can be no more thanthe highest relation between that which seeks and that which is sought, and itconsists in a modified identity through which we may pass beyond knowledge tothe absolute identity. This metaphysical distinction is of importance because itprevents us from mistaking any relation in knowledge for the absolute and frombecoming so bound by our experience as to lose or miss the fundamental awarenessof the absolute which is beyond all possible description and behind allformulated experience. But it does not render the highest relation in ourknowledge, the modified identity in experience worthless or otiose. On thecontrary, it is that we must aim at as the consummation of our existence in theworld. For if we possess it without being limited by it, — and if we are limitedby it we have not true possession of it, — then in and through it we shall, evenwhile in this body, remain in touch with the Absolute.The means for the attainment of this highest knowledge is the constantpreparation of the mind by the admission into it of a working higher than itselfuntil the mind is capable of giving itself up to the supramental action whichexceeds it and which will finally replace it. In fact, Mind also has to followthe law of natural progression which has governed our evolution in this worldfrom Matter into Life and Life into Mind. For just as Life-consciousness isbeyond the imprisoned material being and unattainable by it through its owninstruments, just as mind-consciousness is beyond the first inconscientmovements of life, so too this supramental consciousness is beyond the dividedand dividing nature of Mind and unattainable by it through its own instruments.But as Matter is constantly prepared for the manifestation of Life until Life isable to move in it, possess it, manage in it its own action and reaction, and asLife is constantly prepared for the manifestation of Mind until Mind is able touse it, enlighten its actions and reactions by higher and higher mental values,so must it be with Mind and that which is beyond Mind.And all this progression is possible because these things are only differentformations of one being and one consciousness. Life only reveals in Matter thatwhich is involved in Matter, that which is the secret meaning and essence ofMatter. It reveals, as it were, to material existence its own soul, its own end.So too Mind reveals in Life all that Life means, all that it obscurely is inessence but cannot realise because it is absorbed in its own practical motionand its own characteristic form. So also Supermind must intervene to reveal Mindto itself, to liberate it from its absorption in its own practical motion andcharacteristic form and enable the mental being to realise that which is thehidden secret of all its formal practice and action. Thus shall man come to theknowledge of that which rules within him and missions his mind to its mark,sends forth his speech, impels the life-force in its paths and sets his sensesto their workings.This supreme cognitive Principle does not think by the mind. Mind is to it aninferior and secondary action, not its own proper mode. For Mind, based onlimitation and division, can act only from a given centre in the lower andobscured existence; but Supermind is founded on unity and it comprehends andpervades; its action is in the universal and is in conscious communion with atranscendent source eternal and beyond the formations of the universe. Supermindregards the individual in the universal and does not begin with him or make ofhim a separate being. It starts from the Transcendent and sees the universal andindividual as they are in relation to it, as its terms, as its formulas; it doesnot start from the individual and universal to arrive at the Transcendent. Mindacquires knowledge and mastery; it reaches it by a constant mentalising andwilling: Supermind possesses knowledge and mastery; possessing, it throws itselfout freely in various willing and knowing. Mind gropes by divided sensation; itarrives at a sort of oneness through sympathy: Supermind possesses by a free andall-embracing sense; it lives in the unity of which various love and sympathyare only a secondary play of manifestation. Supermind starts from the whole andsees in it its parts and properties, it does not build up the knowledge of thewhole by an increasing knowledge of the parts and properties; and even the wholeis to it only a unity of sum, only a partial and inferior term of the higherunity of infinite essence.We see, then, that these two cognitive Principles start from two opposite polesand act in opposite directions by opposite methods. Yet it is by the highercognitive that the lower is formed and governed. Mind is thought by that whichis beyond Mind; the mentalising consciousness shapes and directs its movementaccording to the knowledge and impulse it receives from this higher Supermindand even the stuff of which it is formed belongs to that Principle. Mentalityexists because that which is beyond Mind has conceived an inverse action ofitself working in a thinner, poorer, darker, less powerful substance ofconscious being and founded upon its self-concentration on different points inits own being and in different forms of its own being. Supermind fixes thesepoints, sees how consciousness must act from them on other forms of itself andin obedience to the pressure of those other forms, once a particular rhythm orlaw of universal action is given; it governs the whole action of mentalityaccording to what it thus fixes and sees. Even our ignorance is only thedistorted action of a truth projected from the Supermind and could not existexcept as such a distortion; and so likewise all our dualities of knowledge,sensation, emotion, force proceed from that higher vision, obey it and are asecondary and, as one might say, perverse action of the concealed Superminditself which governs always this lower action in harmony with its firstconception of a located consciousness, divided indeed and therefore not inpossession of its world or itself, but feeling out towards that possession andtowards the unity which, because of the Supermind in us, it instinctively, ifobscurely, knows to be its true nature and right.But, for this very reason, the feeling out, the attempt at acquisition can onlysucceed in proportion as the mental being abandons his characteristic mentalityand its limitations in order to rise beyond to that Mind of the mind which ishis origin and his secret governing principle. His mentality must admitSupramentality as Life has admitted Mind. So long as he worships, follows after,adheres to all this that he now accepts as the object of his pursuit, to themind and its aims, to its broken methods, its constructions of will and opinionand emotion dependent on egoism, division and ignorance, he cannot rise beyondthis death to that immortality which the Upanishad promises to the seeker. ThatBrahman we have to know and seek after and not this which men here adore andpursue.The Upanishad is not satisfied with the definition of the Brahman-consciousnessas Mind of the mind. Just as it has described it as Speech of the speech, soalso it describes it as Eye of the eye, Ear of the ear. Not only is it anabsolute cognition behind the play of expression, but also an absolute Sensebehind the action of the senses. Every part of our being finds its fulfilment inthat which is beyond its present forms of functioning and not in those formsthemselves.This conception of the all-governing supreme consciousness does not fall in withour ordinary theories about sense and mind and the Brahman. We know of senseonly as an action of the organs through which embodied mind communicates withexternal Matter, and these sense-organs have been separately developed in thecourse of evolution; the senses therefore are not fundamental things, but onlysubordinate conveniences and temporary physical functionings of the embodiedmind. Brahman, on the other hand, we conceive of by the elimination of all thatis not fundamental, by the elimination even of the Mind itself. It is a sort ofpositive zero, an X or unknowable which corresponds to no possible equation ofphysical or psychological quantities. In essence this may or may not be true;but we have now to think not of the Unknowable but of its highest manifestationin consciousness; and this we have described as the outlook of the Absolute onthe relative and as that which is the cause and governing power of all that weand the universe are. There in that governing cause there must be somethingessential and supreme of which all our fundamental functionings here are arendering in the terms of embodied consciousness.Sense, however, is not or does not appear to be fundamental; it is only aninstrumentation of Mind using the nervous system. It is not even a pure mentalfunctioning, but depends so much upon the currents of the Life-force, upon itselectric energy vibrating up and down the nerves, that in the Upanishads thesenses are called Pranas, powers or functionings of the Life-force. It is truethat Mind turns these nervous impressions when communicated to it into mentalvalues, but the sense-action itself seems to be rather nervous than mental. Inany case there would, at first sight, appear to be no warrant in reason forattributing a Sense of the sense to that which is not embodied, to a supramentalconsciousness which has no need of any such instrumentation.But this is not the last word about sense; this is only its outward appearancebehind which we must penetrate. What, not in its functioning, but in itsessence, is the thing we call sense? In its functioning, if we analyse thatthoroughly, we see that it is the contact of the mind with an eidolon of Matter,— whether that eidolon be of a vibration of sound, a light-image of form, avolley of earth-particles giving the sense of odour, an impression of rasa orsap that gives the sense of taste, or that direct sense of disturbance of ournervous being which we call touch. No doubt, the contact of Matter with Matteris the original cause of these sensations; but it is only the eidolon of Matter,as for instance the image of the form cast upon the eye, with which the mind isdirectly concerned. For the mind operates upon Matter not directly, but throughthe Life-force; that is its instrument of communication and the Life-force,being in us a nervous energy and not anything material, can seize on Matter onlythrough nervous impressions of form, through contactual images, as it were,which create corresponding values in the energy-consciousness called in theUpanishads the Prana. Mind takes these up and replies to them with correspondingmental values, mental impressions of form, so that the thing sensed comes to usafter a triple process of translation, first the material eidolon, secondly thenervous or energy-image, third the image reproduced in stuff of mind.This elaborate process is concealed from us by the lightning-like rapidity withwhich it is managed, — rapidity in our impressions of Time; for in anothernotation of Time by a creature differently constituted each part of theoperation might be distinctly sensible. But the triple translation is alwaysthere, because there are really three sheaths of consciousness in us, thematerial, annakoṣa, in which the physical contact and image are received andformed, the vital and nervous, prāṇakoṣa, in which there is a nervous contactand formation, the mental, manaḥkoṣa, in which there is mental contact andimaging. We dwell centred in the mental sheath and therefore the experience ofthe material world has to come through the other two sheaths before it can reachus.The foundation of sense, therefore, is contact, and the essential contact is themental without which there would not be sense at all. The plant, for instance,feels nervously, feels in terms of life-energy, precisely as the human nervoussystem does, and it has precisely the same reactions; but it is only if theplant has rudimentary mind that we can suppose it to be, as we understand theword, sensible of these nervous or vital impressions and reactions. For then itwould feel not only nervously, but in terms of mind. Sense, then, may bedescribed as in its essence mental contact with an object and the mentalreproduction of its image.All these things we observe and reason of in terms of this embodiment of mind inMatter; for these sheaths or koṣas are formations in a more and more subtlesubstance reposing on gross Matter as their base. Let us imagine that there is amental world in which Mind and not Matter is the base. There sense would bequite a different thing in its operation. It would feel mentally an image inMind and throw it out into form in more and more gross substance; and whateverphysical formations there might already be in that world would respond rapidlyto the Mind and obey its modifying suggestions. Mind would be masterful,creative, originative, not as with us either obedient to Matter and merelyreproductive or else in struggle with it and only with difficulty able to modifya material predetermined and dully reluctant to its touch. It would be, subjectto whatever supramental power might be above it, master of a ductile and easilyresponsive material. But still Sense would be there, because contact in mentalconsciousness and formation of images would still be part of the law of being.Mind, in fact, or active consciousness generally has four necessary functionswhich are indispensable to it wherever and however it may act and of which theUpanishads speak in the four terms, vijñāna, prajñāna, saṁjñāna and ājñāna.Vijnana is the original comprehensive consciousness which holds an image ofthings at once in its essence, its totality and its parts and properties; it isthe original, spontaneous, true and complete view of it which belongs properlyto the supermind and of which mind has only a shadow in the highest operationsof the comprehensive intellect. Prajnana is the consciousness which holds animage of things before it as an object with which it has to enter into relationsand to possess by apprehension and a combined analytic and synthetic cognition.Sanjnana is the contact of consciousness with an image of things by which thereis a sensible possession of it in its substance; if prajnana can be described asthe outgoing of apprehensive consciousness to possess its object in consciousenergy, to know it, sanjnana can be described as the inbringing movement ofapprehensive consciousness which draws the object placed before it back toitself so as to possess it in conscious substance, to feel it. Ajnana is theoperation by which consciousness dwells on an image of things so as to hold,govern and possess it in power. These four, therefore, are the basis of allconscious action.As our human psychology is constituted, we begin with sanjnana, the sense of anobject in its image; the apprehension of it in knowledge follows. Afterwards wetry to arrive at the comprehension of it in knowledge and the possession of itin power. There are secret operations in us, in our subconscient andsuperconscient selves, which precede this action, but of these we are not awarein our surface being and therefore for us they do not exist. If we knew of them,our whole conscious functioning would be changed. As it is what happens is arapid process by which we sense an image and have of it an apprehensive perceptand concept, and a slower process of the intellect by which we try to comprehendand possess it. The former process is the natural action of the mind which hasentirely developed in us; the latter is an acquired action, an action of theintellect and the intelligent will which represent in Mind an attempt of themental being to do what can only be done with perfect spontaneity and mastery bysomething higher than Mind. The intellect and intelligent will form a bridge bywhich the mental being is trying to establish a conscious connection with thesupramental and to prepare the embodied soul for the descent into it of asupramental action. Therefore the first process is comparatively easy,spontaneous, rapid, perfect; the second slow, laboured, imperfect. In proportionas the intellectual action becomes associated with and dominated by arudimentary supramental action, — and it is this which constitutes thephenomenon of genius, — the second process also becomes more and more easy,spontaneous, rapid and perfect.If we suppose a supreme consciousness, master of the world, which reallyconducts behind the veil all the operations the mental gods attribute tothemselves, it will be obvious that that consciousness will be the entire Knowerand Lord. The basis of its action or government of the world will be theperfect, original and all-possessing vijnana and ajnana. It will comprehend allthings in its energy of conscious knowledge, control all things in its energy ofconscious power. These energies will be the spontaneous inherent action of itsconscious being creative and possessive of the forms of the universe. What partthen will be left for the apprehensive consciousness and the sense? They will benot independent functions, but subordinate operations involved in the action ofthe comprehensive consciousness itself. In fact, all four there will be onerapid movement. If we had all these four acting in us with the unified rapiditywith which the prajnana and sanjnana act, we should then have in our notation ofTime some inadequate image of the unity of the supreme action of the supremeenergy.If we consider, we shall see that this must be so. The supreme consciousnessmust not only comprehend and possess in its conscious being the images of thingswhich it creates as its self-expression, but it must place them before it —always in its own being, not externally — and have a certain relation with themby the two terms of apprehensive consciousness. Otherwise the universe would nottake the form that it has for us; for we only reflect in the terms of ourorganisation the movements of the supreme Energy. But by the very fact that theimages of things are there held in front of an apprehending consciousness withinthe comprehending conscious being and not externalised as our individual mindexternalises them, the supreme Mind and supreme Sense will be something quitedifferent from our mentality and our forms of sensation. They will be terms ofan entire knowledge and self-possession and not terms of an ignorance andlimitation which strives to know and possess.In its essential and general term our sense must reflect and be the creation ofthis supreme Sense. But the Upanishad speaks of a Sight behind our sight and aHearing behind our hearing, not in general terms of a Sense behind our sense.Certainly eye and ear are only taken as typical of the senses, and are chosenbecause they are the highest and subtlest of them all. But still thedifferentiation of sense which forms part of our mentality is evidently held tocorrespond with a differentiation of some kind in the supreme Sense. How is thispossible? It is what we have next to unravel by examining the nature and sourceof the functioning of the separate senses in ourselves, — their source in ourmentality and not merely their functioning in the actual terms of ourlife-energy and our body. What is it in Mind that is fundamental to sight andhearing? Why do we see and hear and not simply sense with the mind?Mind was called by Indian psychologists the eleventh and ranks as the supremesense. In the ancient arrangement of the senses, five of knowledge and five ofaction, it was the sixth of the organs of knowledge and at the same time thesixth of the organs of action. It is a commonplace of psychology that theeffective functioning of the senses of knowledge is inoperative without theassistance of the mind; the eye may see, the ear may hear, all the senses mayact, but if the mind pays no attention, the man has not heard, seen, felt,touched or tasted. Similarly, according to psychology, the organs of action actonly by the force of the mind operating as will or, physiologically, by thereactive nervous force from the brain which must be according to materialisticnotions the true self and essence of all will. In any case, the senses or allsenses, if there are other than the ten, — according to a text in the Upanishadthere should be at least fourteen, seven and seven, — all senses appear to beonly organisations, functionings, instrumentations of the mind-consciousness,devices which it has formed in the course of its evolution in living Matter.Modern psychology has extended our knowledge and has admitted us to a truthwhich the ancients already knew but expressed in other language. We know now orwe rediscover the truth that the conscious operation of mind is only a surfaceaction. There is a much vaster and more potent subconscious mind which losesnothing of what the senses bring to it; it keeps all its wealth in aninexhaustible store of memory, akṣitam śravaḥ. The surface mind may pay noattention, still the subconscious mind attends, receives, treasures up with aninfallible accuracy. The illiterate servant-girl hears daily her master recitingHebrew in his study; the surface mind pays no attention to the unintelligiblegibberish, but the subconscious mind hears, remembers and, when in an abnormalcondition it comes up to the surface, reproduces those learned recitations witha portentous accuracy which the most correct and retentive scholar might envy.The man or mind has not heard because he did not attend; the greater man or mindwithin has heard because he always attends, or rather sub-tends, with aninfinite capacity. So too a man put under an anaesthetic and operated upon hasfelt nothing; but release his subconscious mind by hypnosis and he will relateaccurately every detail of the operation and its appropriate sufferings; for thestupor of the physical sense-organ could not prevent the larger mind within fromobserving and feeling.Similarly we know that a large part of our physical action is instinctive anddirected not by the surface but by the subconscious mind. And we know now thatit is a mind that acts and not merely an ignorant nervous reaction from thebrute physical brain. The subconscious mind in the catering insect knows theanatomy of the victim it intends to immobilise and make food for its young andit directs the sting accordingly, as unerringly as the most skilful surgeon,provided the mere limited surface mind with its groping and faltering nervousaction does not get in the way and falsify the inner knowledge or the innerwill-force.These examples point us to truths which western psychology, hampered by pastignorance posing as scientific orthodoxy, still ignores or refuses toacknowledge. The Upanishads declare that the Mind in us is infinite; it knowsnot only what has been seen but what has not been seen, not only what has beenheard but what has not been heard, not only what has been discriminated by thethought but what has not been discriminated by the thought. Let us say, then, inthe tongue of our modern knowledge that the surface man in us is limited by hisphysical experiences; he knows only what his nervous life in the body brings tohis embodied mind; and even of those bringings he knows, he can retain andutilise only so much as his surface mind-sense attends to and consciouslyremembers; but there is a larger subliminal consciousness within him which isnot thus limited. That consciousness senses what has not been sensed by thesurface mind and its organs and knows what the surface mind has not learned byits acquisitive thought. That in the insect knows the anatomy of its victim;that in the man outwardly insensible not only feels and remembers the action ofthe surgeon’s knife, but knows the appropriate reactions of suffering which werein the physical body inhibited by the anaesthetic and therefore non-existent;that in the illiterate servant-girl heard and retained accurately the words ofan unknown language and could, as Yogic experience knows, by a higher action ofitself understand those superficially unintelligible sounds.To return to the Vedantic words we have been using, there is a vaster action ofthe Sanjnana which is not limited by the action of the physical sense-organs; itwas this which sensed perfectly and made its own through the ear the words ofthe unknown language, through the touch the movements of the unfelt surgeon’sknife, through the sense-mind or sixth sense the exact location of the centresof locomotion in the victim insect. There is also associated with it acorresponding vaster action of Prajnana, Ajnana and Vijnana not limited by thesmaller apprehensive and comprehensive faculties of the external mind. It isthis vaster Prajnana which perceived the proper relation of the words to eachother, of the movement of the knife to the unfelt suffering of the nerves and ofthe successive relation in space of the articulations in the insect’s body. Suchperception was inherent in the right reproduction of the words, the rightnarration of the sufferings, the right successive action of the sting. TheAjnana or Knowledge-Will originating all these actions was also vaster, notlimited by the faltering force that governs the operations directed by thesurface mind. And although in these examples the action of the vaster Vijnana isnot so apparent, yet it was evidently there working through them and ensuringtheir co-ordination.But at present it is with the Sanjnana that we are concerned. Here we shouldnote, first of all, that there is an action of the sense-mind which is superiorto the particular action of the senses and is aware of things even withoutimaging them in forms of sight, sound, contact, but which also as a sort ofsubordinate operation, subordinate but necessary to completeness ofpresentation, does image in these forms. This is evident in psychical phenomena.Those who have carried the study and experimentation of them to a certainextent, have found that we can sense things known only to the minds of others,things that exist only at a great distance, things that belong to another planethan the terrestrial but have here their effects; we can both sense them intheir images and also feel, as it were, all that they are without any definiteimage proper to the five senses.This shows, in the first place, that sight and the other senses are not mereresults of the development of our physical organs in the terrestrial evolution.Mind, subconscious in all Matter and evolving in Matter, has developed thesephysical organs in order to apply its inherent capacities of sight, hearingetc., on the physical plane by physical means for a physical life; but they areinherent capacities and not dependent on the circumstance of terrestrialevolution and they can be employed without the use of the physical eye, ear,skin, palate. Supposing that there are psychical senses which act through apsychical body, and we thus explain these psychical phenomena, still that actionalso is only an organisation of the inherent functioning of the essential sense,the Sanjnana, which in itself can operate without bodily organs. This essentialsense is the original capacity of consciousness to feel in itself all thatconsciousness has formed and to feel it in all the essential properties andoperations of that which has form, whether represented materially by vibrationof sound or images of light or any other physical symbol.The trend of knowledge leads more and more to the conclusion that not only arethe properties of form, even the most obvious such as colour, light etc., merelyoperations of Force, but form itself is only an operation of Force. This Forceagain proves to be self-power of conscious-being[1] in a state of energy andactivity. Practically, therefore, all form is only an operation of consciousnessimpressing itself with presentations of its own workings. We see colour becausethat is the presentation which consciousness makes to itself of one of its ownoperations; but colour is only an operation of Force working in the form ofLight, and Light again is only a movement, that is to say an operation of Force.The question is what is essential to this operation of Force taking on itselfthe presentation of form? For it is this that must determine the working ofSanjnana or Sense on whatever plane it may operate.Everything begins with vibration or movement, the original kṣobha ordisturbance. If there is no movement of the conscious being, it can only knowits own pure static existence. Without vibration[2] or movement of being inconsciousness there can be no act of knowledge and therefore no sense; withoutvibration or movement of being in force there can be no object of sense.Movement of conscious being as knowledge becoming sensible of itself as movementof force, in other words the knowledge separating itself from its own working towatch that and take it into itself again by feeling, — this is the basis ofuniversal Sanjnana. This is true both of our internal and external operations. Ibecome anger by a vibration of conscious force acting as nervous emotion and Ifeel the anger that I have become by another movement of conscious force actingas light of knowledge. I am conscious of my body because I have myself becomethe body; that same force of conscious being which has made this form of itself,this presentation of its workings knows it in that form, in that presentation. Ican know nothing except what I myself am; if I know others, it is because theyalso are myself, because my self has assumed these apparently alienpresentations as well as that which is nearest to my own mental centre. Allsensation, all action of sense is thus the same in essence whether external orinternal, physical or psychical.But this vibration of conscious being is presented to itself by various forms ofsense which answer to the successive operations of movement in its assumption ofform. For first we have intensity of vibration creating regular rhythm which isthe basis or constituent of all creative formation; secondly, contact orintermiscence of the movements of conscious being which constitute the rhythm;thirdly, definition of the grouping of movements which are in contact, theirshape; fourthly, the constant welling up of the essential force to support inits continuity the movement that has been thus defined; fifthly, the actualenforcement and compression of the force in its own movement which maintains theform that has been assumed. In Matter these five constituent operations are saidby the Sankhyas to represent themselves as five elemental conditions ofsubstance, the etheric, atmospheric, igneous, liquid and solid; and the rhythmof vibration is seen by them as śabda, sound, the basis of hearing, theintermiscence as contact, the basis of touch, the definition as shape, the basisof sight, the upflow of force as rasa, sap, the basis of taste, and thedischarge of the atomic compression as gandha, odour, the basis of smell. It istrue that this is only predicated of pure or subtle Matter; the physical matterof our world being a mixed operation of force, these five elemental states arenot found there separately except in a very modified form. But all these areonly the physical workings or symbols. Essentially all formation, to the mostsubtle and most beyond our senses such as form of mind, form of character, formof soul, amount when scrutinised to this fivefold operation of conscious-forcein movement.All these operations, then, the Sanjnana or essential sense must be able toseize, to make its own by that union in knowledge of knower and object which ispeculiar to itself. Its sense of the rhythm or intensity of the vibrations whichcontain in themselves all the meaning of the form, will be the basis of theessential hearing of which our apprehension of physical sound or the spoken wordis only the most outward result; so also its sense of the contact orintermiscence of conscious force with conscious force must be the basis of theessential touch; its sense of the definition or form of force must be the basisof the essential sight; its sense of the upflow of essential being in the form,that which is the secret of its self-delight, must be the basis of the essentialtaste; its sense of the compression of force and the self-discharge of itsessence of being must be the basis of the essential inhalation grosslyrepresented in physical substance by the sense of smell. On whatever plane, towhatever kind of formation these essentialities of sense will apply themselvesand on each they will seek an appropriate organisation, an appropriatefunctioning.This various sense will, it is obvious, be in the highest consciousness acomplex unity, just as we have seen that there the various operation ofknowledge is also a complex unity. Even if we examine the physical senses, say,the sense of hearing, if we observe how the underlying mind receives theiraction, we shall see that in their essence all the senses are in each other.That mind is not only aware of the vibration which we call sound; it is awarealso of the contact and interchange between the force in the sound and thenervous force in us with which that intermixes; it is aware of the definition orform of the sound and of the complex contacts or relations which make up theform; it is aware of the essence or outwelling conscious force which constitutesand maintains the sound and prolongs its vibrations in our nervous being; it isaware of our own nervous inhalation of the vibratory discharge proceeding fromthe compression of force which makes, so to speak, the solidity of the sound.All these sensations enter into the sensitive reception and joy of music whichis the highest physical form of this operation of force, — they constitute ourphysical sensitiveness to it and the joy of our nervous being in it; diminishone of them and the joy and the sensitiveness are to that extent dulled. Muchmore must there be this complex unity in a higher than the physicalconsciousness and most of all must there be unity in the highest. But theessential sense must be capable also of seizing the secret essence of allconscious being in action, in itself and not only through the results of theoperation; its appreciation of these results can be nothing more than itself anoutcome of this deeper sense which it has of the essence of the Thing behind itsappearances.If we consider these things thus subtly in the light of our own deeperpsychology and pursue them beyond the physical appearances by which they arecovered, we shall get to some intellectual conception of the sense behind oursenses or rather the Sense of our senses, the Sight of our sight and the Hearingof our hearing. The Brahman-consciousness of which the Upanishad speaks is notthe Absolute withdrawn into itself, but that Absolute in its outlook on therelative; it is the Lord, the Master-Soul, the governing Transcendent and All,He who constitutes and controls the action of the gods on the different planesof our being. Since it constitutes them, all our workings can be no more thanpsychical and physical results and representations of something essential properto its supreme creative outlook, our sense a shadow of the divine Sense, oursight of the divine Sight, our hearing of the divine Hearing. Nor is that divineSight and Hearing limited to things physical, but extend themselves to all formsand operations of conscious being.The supreme Consciousness does not depend on what we call sight and hearing forits own essential seeing and audition. It operates by a supreme Sense, creativeand comprehensive, of which our physical and psychical sight and hearing areexternal results and partial operations. Neither is it ignorant of these, norexcludes them; for since it constitutes and controls, it must be aware of thembut from a supreme plane, paraṁ dhāma, which includes all in its view; for itsoriginal action is that highest movement of Vishnu which, the Veda tells us, theseers behold like an eye extended in heaven. It is that by which the soul seesits seeings and hears its hearings; but all sense only assumes its true valueand attains to its absolute, its immortal reality when we cease to pursue thesatisfactions of the mere external and physical senses and go beyond even thepsychical being to this spiritual or essential which is the source and fountain,the knower, constituent and true valuer of all the rest.This spiritual sense of things, secret and superconscient in us, alone givestheir being, worth and reality to the psychical and physical sense; inthemselves they have none. When we attain to it, these inferior operations areas it were taken up into it and the whole world and everything in it changes tous and takes on a different and a non-material value. That Master-consciousnessin us senses our sensations of objects, sees our seeings, hears our hearings nolonger for the benefit of the senses and their desires, but with the embrace ofthe self-existent Bliss which has no cause, beginning or end, eternal in its ownimmortality.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Devātmaśaktiṁ svaguṇair nigūḍhām, self-power of the divine Existent hiddenby its own modes. Shwetashwatara Upanishad.[2] The term is used not because it is entirely adequate or accurate, nophysical term can be, but because it is most suggestive of the original outgoingof consciousness to seek itself."},{"pageContent":"THE SUPERLIFE — LIFE OF OUR LIFEBut the Brahman-consciousness is not only Mind of our mind, Speech of ourspeech, Sense of our sense; it is also Life of our life. In other words, it is asupreme and universal energy of existence of which our own material life and itssustaining energy are only an inferior result, a physical symbol, an externaland limited functioning. That which governs our existence and its functionings,does not live and act by them, but is their superior cause and the supra-vitalprinciple out of which they are formed and by which they are controlled.The English word life does duty for many very different shades of meaning; butthe word Prana familiar in the Upanishad and in the language of Yoga isrestricted to the life-force whether viewed in itself or in its functionings.The popular significance of Prana was indeed the breath drawn into and thrownout from the lungs and so, in its most material and common sense, the life orthe life-breath; but this is not the philosophic significance of the word as itis used in the Upanishads. The Prana of the Upanishads is the life-energy itselfwhich was supposed to occupy and act in the body with a fivefold movement, eachwith its characteristic name and each quite as necessary to the functioning ofthe life of the body as the act of respiration. Respiration in fact is only oneaction of the chief movement of the life-energy, the first of the five, — theaction which is most normally necessary and vital to the maintenance anddistribution of the energy in the physical frame, but which can yet be suspendedwithout the life being necessarily destroyed.The existence of a vital force or life-energy has been doubted by westernScience, because that Science concerns itself only with the most externaloperations of Nature and has as yet no true knowledge of anything except thephysical and outward. This Prana, this life-force is not physical in itself; itis not material energy, but rather a different principle supporting Matter andinvolved in it. It supports and occupies all forms and without it no physicalform could have come into being or could remain in being. It acts in allmaterial forces such as electricity and is nearest to self-manifestation inthose that are nearest to pure force; material forces could not exist or actwithout it, for from it they derive their energy and movement and they are itsvehicles. But all material aspects are only field and form of the Prana which isin itself a pure energy, their cause and not their result. It cannot thereforebe detected by any physical analysis; physical analysis can only resolve for usthe combinations of those material happenings which are its results and theexternal signs and symbols of its presence and operation.How then do we become aware of its existence? By that purification of our mindand body and that subtilisation of our means of sensation and knowledge whichbecome possible through Yoga. We become capable of analysis other than theresolution of forms into their gross physical elements and are able todistinguish the operations of the pure mental principle from those of thematerial and both of these from the vital or dynamic which forms a link betweenthem and supports them both. We are then able to distinguish the movements ofthe Pranic currents not only in the physical body which is all that we arenormally aware of, but in that subtle frame of our being which Yoga detectsunderlying and sustaining the physical. This is ordinarily done by the processof Pranayama, the government and control of the respiration. By Pranayama theHathayogin is able to control, suspend and transcend the ordinary fixedoperation of the Pranic energy which is all that Nature needs for the normalfunctioning of the body and of the physical life and mind, and he becomes awareof the channels in which that energy distributes itself in all its workings andis therefore able to do things with his body which seem miraculous to theignorant, just as the physical scientist by his knowledge of the workings ofmaterial forces is able to do things with them which would seem to us magic iftheir law and process were not divulged. For all the workings of life in thephysical form are governed by the Prana and not only those which are normal andconstant and those which, being always potential, can be easily brought forwardand set in action, but those which are of a more remote potentiality and seem toour average experience difficult or impossible.But the Pranic energy supports not only the operations of our physical life, butalso those of the mind in the living body. Therefore by the control of thePranic energy it is not only possible to control our physical and vitalfunctionings and to transcend their ordinary operation, but to control also theworkings of the mind and to transcend its ordinary operations. The human mind infact depends always on the Pranic force which links it with the body throughwhich it manifests itself, and it is able to deploy its own force only inproportion as it can make that energy available for its own uses and subservientto its own purposes. In proportion, therefore, as the Yogin gets back to thecontrol of the Prana, and by the direction of its batteries opens up thosenervous centres (cakras) in which it is now sluggish or only partiallyoperative, he is able to manifest powers of mind, sense and consciousness whichtranscend our ordinary experience. The so-called occult powers of Yoga are suchfaculties which thus open up of themselves as the Yogin advances in the controlof the Pranic force and, purifying the channels of its movement, establishes anincreasing communication between the consciousness of his subtle subliminalbeing and the consciousness of his gross physical and superficial existence.Thus the Prana is vital or nervous force which bears the operations of mind andbody, is yoked by them as it were like a horse to a chariot and driven by themind along the paths on which it wishes to travel to the goal of its desire.Therefore it is described in this Upanishad as yoked and moving forward andagain as being led forward, the images recalling the Vedic symbol of the Horseby which the Pranic force is constantly designated in the Rig-veda. It is infact that which does all the action of the world in obedience to conscious orsubconscious mind and in the conditions of material force and material form.While the mind is that movement of Nature in us which represents in the mould ofour material and phenomenal existence and within the triple term of theIgnorance the knowledge aspect of the Brahman, the consciousness of the knower,and body is that which similarly represents the being of the existent in themask of phenomenally divisible substance, so Prana or life-energy represents inthe flux of phenomenal things the force, the active dynamis of the Lord whocontrols and enjoys the manifestation of His own being.[1] It is a universalenergy present in every atom and particle of the universe, and active in everystirring and current of the constant flux and interchange which constitutes theworld.But just as mind is only an inferior movement of the supreme Conscious-Being andabove mind there is a divine and infinite principle of consciousness, will andknowledge which controls the ignorant action of mind, and it is by this superiorprinciple and not by mind that Brahman cognises His own being whether in itselfor in its manifestation, so also it must be with this Life-force. Thecharacteristics of the Life-force as it manifests itself in us are desire,hunger, an enjoyment which devours the object enjoyed and a sensational movementand activity of response which gropes after possession and seeks to pervade,embrace, take into itself the object of its desire.[2] It is not in this breathof desire and mortal enjoyment that the true life can consist or the highest,divine energy act, any more than the supreme knowledge can think in the terms ofignorant, groping, limited and divided mind. As the movements of mind are merelyrepresentations in the terms of the duality and the ignorance, reflections of asupreme consciousness and knowledge, so the movements of this life-force canonly be similar representations of a supreme energy expressing a higher andtruer existence possessed of that consciousness and knowledge and therefore freefrom desire, hunger, transient enjoyment and hampered activity. What is desirehere must there be self-existent Will or Love; what is hunger here must there bedesireless satisfaction; what is here enjoyment must there be self-existentdelight; what is here a groping action and response, must be thereself-possessing and all-possessing energy, — such must be the Life of our lifeby which this inferior action is sustained and led to its goal. Brahman does notbreathe with the breath, does not live by this Life-force and its dual terms ofbirth and death.What then is this Life of our life? It is the supreme Energy[3] which is nothingbut the infinite force in action of the supreme conscious Being in His ownillumined self. The Self-existent is luminously aware of Himself and full of Hisown delight; and that self-awareness is a timeless self-possession which inaction reveals itself as a force of infinite consciousness omnipotent as well asomniscient; for it exists between two poles, one of eternal stillness and pureidentity, the other of eternal energy and identity of All with itself, thestillness eternally supporting the energy. That is the true existence, the Lifefrom which our life proceeds; that is the immortality, while what we cling to aslife is “hunger that is death”. Therefore the object of the wise must be to passin their illumined consciousness beyond the false and phenomenal terms of lifeand death to this immortality.Yet is this Life-force, however inferior its workings, instinct with the being,will, light of that which it represents, of that which transcends it; by That itis “led forward” on its paths to a goal which its own existence implies by thevery imperfection of its movements and renderings. This death called life is notonly a dark figure of that light, but it is the passage by which we pass throughtransmutation of our being from the death-sleep of Matter into the spirit’sinfinite immortality.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] The three are the reverse aspects of Chit, Sat and Chit-Tapas.[2] All these significances are intended by the Vedic Rishis in their use of theword aśva, Horse, for the prāṇa, the root being capable of all of them as we seefrom the words āśā, hope; aśanā, hunger; aś, to eat; aś, to enjoy; āśu, swift;aś, to move, attain, pervade, etc.[3] Tapas or Chit-Shakti."},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT TRANSITIONThe thought of the Upanishad as expressed in its first chapter in the brief andpregnant sentences of the Upanishadic style, amounts then to this result thatthe life of the mind, senses, vital activities in which we dwell is not thewhole or the chief part of our existence, not the highest, not self-existent,not master of itself. It is an outer fringe, a lower result, an inferior workingof something beyond; a superconscient Existence has developed, supports andgoverns this partial and fragmentary, this incomplete and unsatisfyingconsciousness and activity of the mind, life and senses. To rise out of thisexternal and surface consciousness towards and into that superconscient is ourprogress, our goal, our destiny of completeness and satisfaction.The Upanishad does not assert the unreality, but only the incompleteness andinferiority of our present existence. All that we follow after here is animperfect representation, a broken and divided functioning of what is eternallyin an absolute perfection on that higher plane of existence. This mind of oursunpossessed of its object, groping, purblind, besieged by error and incapacity,its action founded on an external vision of things, is only the shadow thrown bya superconscient Knowledge which possesses, creates and securely uses the truthof things because nothing is external to it, nothing is other than itself,nothing is divided or at war within its all-comprehensive self-awareness. Thatis the Mind of our mind. Our speech, limited, mechanical, imperfectlyinterpretative of the outsides of things, restricted by the narrow circle of themind, based on the appearances of sense is only the far-off and feeble response,the ignorant vibration returned to a creative and revelatory Word which hasbuilt up all the forms which our mind and speech seek to comprehend and express.Our sense, a movement in stuff of consciousness vibratory to outward impacts,attempting imperfectly to grasp them by laboured and separately convergingreactions, is only the faulty image of a supreme Sense which at once, fully,harmoniously unites itself with and enjoys all that the supreme Mind and Speechcreate in the self-joyous activity of the divine and infinite existence. Ourlife, a breath of force and movement and possession attached to a form of mindand body and restricted by the form, limited in its force, hampered in itsmovement, besieged in its possession and therefore a thing of discords at warwith itself and its environment, hungering and unsatisfied, moving inconstantlyfrom object to object and unable to embrace and retain their multiplicity,devouring its objects of enjoyment and therefore transient in its enjoyments, isonly a broken movement of the one, undivided, infinite Life which isall-possessing and ever satisfied because in all it enjoys its eternal selfunimprisoned by the divisions of Space, unoccupied by the moments of Time,undeluded by the successions of Cause and Circumstance.This superconscient Existence, one, conscious of itself, conscious both of itseternal peace and its omniscient and omnipotent force, is also conscious of ourcosmic existence which it holds in itself, inspires secretly and omnipotentlygoverns. It is the Lord of the Isha Upanishad who inhabits all the creations ofHis Force, all form of movement in the ever mobile principle of cosmos. It isour self and that of which and by which we are constituted in all our being andactivities, the Brahman. The mortal life is a dual representation of That withtwo conflicting elements in it, negative and positive. Its negative elements ofdeath, suffering, incapacity, strife, division, limitation are a dark figurewhich conceal and serve the development of that which its positive elementscannot yet achieve, — immortality hiding itself from life in the figure ofdeath, delight hiding itself from pleasure in the figure of suffering, infiniteforce hiding itself from finite effort in the figure of incapacity, fusion oflove hiding itself from desire in the figure of strife, unity hiding itself fromacquisition in the figure of division, infinity hiding itself from growth in thefigure of limitation. The positive elements suggest what the Brahman is, butnever are what the Brahman is, although their victory, the victory of the gods,is always the victory of the Brahman over its own self-negations, always theself-affirmation of His vastness against the denials of the dark and limitingfigure of things. Still, it is not this vastness merely, but the absoluteinfinity which is Brahman itself. And therefore within this dual figure ofthings we cannot attain to our self, our Highest; we have to transcend in orderto attain. Our pursuit of the positive elements of this existence, our worshipof the gods of the mind, life, sense is only a preparatory to the real travailof the soul, and we must leave this lower Brahman and know that Higher if we areto fulfil ourselves. We pursue, for instance, our mental growth, we becomemental beings full of an accomplished thought-power and thought-acquisition,dhīrāḥ, in order that we may by thought of mind go beyond mind itself to theEternal. For always the life of mind and senses is the jurisdiction of death andlimitation; beyond is the immortality.The wise, therefore, the souls seated and accomplished in luminous thought-powerput away from them the dualities of our mind, life and senses and go forwardfrom this world; they go beyond to the unity and the immortality. The word usedfor going forward is that which expresses the passage of death; it is also thatwhich the Upanishad uses for the forward movement of the Life-force yoked to thecar of embodied mind and sense on the paths of life. And in this coincidence wecan find a double and most pregnant suggestion.It is not by abandoning life on earth in order to pursue immortality on othermore favourable planes of existence that the great achievement becomes possible.It is here, ihaiva, in this mortal life and body that immortality must be won,here in this lower Brahman and by this embodied soul that the Higher must beknown and possessed. “If here one find it not, great is the perdition.” ThisLife-force in us is led forward by the attraction of the supreme Life on itspath of constant acquisition through types of the Brahman until it reaches apoint where it has to go entirely forward, to go across out of the mortal life,the mortal vision of things to some Beyond. So long as death is not entirelyconquered, this going beyond is represented in the terms of death and by apassing into other worlds where death is not present, where a type ofimmortality is tasted corresponding to that which we have found here in oursoul-experience; but the attraction of death and limitation is not overpassedbecause they still conceal something of immortality and infinity which we havenot yet achieved; therefore there is a necessity of return, an insistent utilityof farther life in the mortal body which we do not overcome until we have passedbeyond all types to the very being of the Infinite, One and Immortal.The worlds of which the Upanishad speaks are essentially soul-conditions and notgeographical divisions of the cosmos. This material universe is itself onlyexistence as we see it when the soul dwells on the plane of material movementand experience in which the spirit involves itself in form, and therefore allthe framework of things in which it moves by the life and which it embraces bythe consciousness is determined by the principle of infinite division andaggregation proper to Matter, to substance of form. This becomes then its worldor vision of things. And to whatever soul-condition it climbs, its vision ofthings will change from the material vision and correspond to that othercondition, and in that other framework it will move in its living and embrace itin its consciousness. These are the worlds of the ancient tradition.But the soul that has entirely realised immortality passes beyond all worlds andis free from frameworks. It enters into the being of the Lord; like this supremesuperconscient Self and Brahman, it is not subdued to life and death. It is nolonger subject to the necessity of entering into the cycle of rebirth, oftravelling continually between the imprisoning dualities of death and birth,affirmation and negation; for it has transcended name and form. This victory,this supreme immortality it must achieve here as an embodied soul in the mortalframework of things. Afterwards, like the Brahman, it transcends and yetembraces the cosmic existence without being subject to it. Personal freedom,personal fulfilment is then achieved by the liberation of the soul fromimprisonment in the form of this changing personality and by its ascent to theOne that is the All. If afterwards there is any assumption of the figure ofmortality, it is an assumption and not a subjection, a help brought to the worldand not a help to be derived from it, a descent of the ensouled superconscientexistence not from any personal necessity, but from the universal need in thecosmic labour for those yet unfree and unfulfilled to be helped and strengthenedby the force that has already described the path up to the goal in itsexperience and achieved under the same conditions the Work and the Sacrifice.Before we can proceed to the problem how, being what we are and the Brahmanbeing what it is, we can effect the transition from the status of mind, life andsenses proper to man over to the status proper to the supreme Consciousnesswhich is master of mind, life and senses, another and prior question arises. TheUpanishad does not state it explicitly, but implies and answers it with thestrongest emphasis on the solution and the subtlest variety in its repetition ofthe apparent paradox that is presented.The Master-Consciousness of the Brahman is that for which we have to abandonthis lesser status of the mere creature subject to the movement of Nature in thecosmos; but after all this Master-Consciousness, however high and great a thingit may be, has a relation to the universe and the cosmic movement; it cannot bethe utter Absolute, Brahman superior to all relativities. This Conscious-Beingwho originates, supports and governs our mind, life, senses is the Lord; butwhere there is no universe of relativities, there can be no Lord, for there isno movement to transcend and govern. Is not then this Lord, as one might say ina later language, not so much the creator of Maya as himself a creation of Maya?Do not both Lord and cosmos disappear when we go beyond all cosmos? And is itnot beyond all cosmos that the only true reality exists? Is it not this onlytrue reality and not the Mind of our mind, the Sense of our sense, the Life ofour life, the Word behind our speech, which we have to know and possess? As wemust go behind all effects to the Cause, must we not equally go beyond the Causeto that in which neither cause nor effects exist? Is not even the immortalityspoken of in the Veda and Upanishads a petty thing to be overpassed andabandoned? and should we not reach towards the utter Ineffable where mortalityand immortality cease to have any meaning?The Upanishad does not put to itself the question in this form and languagewhich only became possible when Nihilistic Buddhism and Vedantic Illusionism hadpassed over the face of our thought and modified philosophical speech andconcepts. But it knows of the ineffable Absolute which is the utter reality andabsoluteness of the Lord even as the Lord is the absolute of all that is in thecosmos. Of That it proceeds to speak in the only way in which it can be spokenof by the human mind.Its answer to the problem is that That is precisely the Unknowable[1] of whichno relations can be affirmed[2] and about which therefore our intellect must forever be silent. The injunction to know the utterly Unknowable would be withoutany sense or practical meaning. Not that That is a Nihil, a pure Negative, butit cannot either be described by any of the positives of which our mind, speechor perception is capable, nor even can it be indicated by any of them. It isonly a little that we know; it is only in the terms of the little that we canput the mental forms of our knowledge. Even when we go beyond to the real formof the Brahman which is not this universe, we can only indicate, we cannotreally describe. If then we think we have known it perfectly, we betray ourignorance; we show that we know very little indeed, not even the little that wecan put into the forms of our knowledge. For the universe seen as our mind seesit is the little, the divided, the parcelling out of existence and consciousnessin which we know and express things by fragments, and we can never really cagein our intellectual and verbal fictions that infinite totality. Yet it isthrough the principles manifested in the universe that we have to arrive atThat, through the life, through the mind and through that highest mentalknowledge which grasps at the fundamental Ideas that are like doors concealingbehind them the Brahman and yet seeming to reveal Him.Much less, then, if we can only thus know the Master-Consciousness which is theform of the Brahman, can we pretend to know its utter ineffable reality which isbeyond all knowledge. But if this were all, there would be no hope for the souland a resigned Agnosticism would be the last word of wisdom. The truth is thatthough thus beyond our mentality and our highest ideative knowledge, the Supremedoes give Himself both to this knowledge and to our mentality in the way properto each and by following that way we can arrive at Him, but only on conditionthat we do not take our mentalising by the mind and our knowing by the higherthought for the full knowledge and rest in that with a satisfied possession.The way is to use our mind rightly for such knowledge as is open to its highest,purified capacity. We have to know the form of the Brahman, theMaster-Consciousness of the Lord through and yet beyond the universe in which welive. But first we must put aside what is mere form and phenomenon in theuniverse; for that has nothing to do with the form of the Brahman, the body ofthe Self, since it is not His form, but only His most external mask. Our firststep therefore must be to get behind the forms of Matter, the forms of Life, theforms of Mind and go back to that which is essential, most real, nearest toactual entity. And when we have gone on thus eliminating, thus analysing allforms into the fundamental entities of the cosmos, we shall find that thesefundamental entities are really only two, ourselves and the gods.The gods of the Upanishad have been supposed to be a figure for the senses, butalthough they act in the senses, they are yet much more than that. Theyrepresent the divine power in its great and fundamental cosmic functioningswhether in man or in mind and life and matter in general; they are not thefunctionings themselves but something of the Divine which is essential to theiroperation and its immediate possessor and cause. They are, as we see from otherUpanishads, positive self-representations of the Brahman leading to good, joy,light, love, immortality as against all that is a dark negation of these things.And it is necessarily in the mind, life, senses, and speech of man that thebattle here reaches its height and approaches to its full meaning. The gods seekto lead these to good and light; the Titans, sons of darkness, seek to piercethem with ignorance and evil.[3] Behind the gods is the Master-Consciousness ofwhich they are the positive cosmic self-representations.The other entity which represents the Brahman in the cosmos is the self of theliving and thinking creature, man. This self also is not an external mask; it isnot form of the mind or form of the life or form of the body. It is somethingthat supports these and makes them possible, something that can say positivelylike the gods, “I am” and not only “I seem”. We have then to scrutinise thesetwo entities and see what they are in relation to each other and to the Brahman;or, as the Upanishad puts it, “That of it which is thou, that of it which is inthe gods, this is what thy mind has to resolve.” Well, but what then of theBrahman is myself? and what of the Brahman is in the Gods? The answer isevident. I am a representation in the cosmos, but for all purposes of the cosmosa real representation of the Self; and the gods are a representation in thecosmos — a real representation since without them the cosmos could not continue— of the Lord. The one supreme Self is the essentiality of all these individualexistences; the one supreme Lord is the Godhead in the gods.The Self and the Lord are one Brahman, whom we can realise through our self andrealise through that which is essential in the cosmic movement. Just as our selfconstitutes our mind, body, life, senses, so that Self constitutes all mind,body, life, senses; it is the origin and essentiality of things. Just as thegods govern, supported by our self, the cosmos of our individual being, theaction of our mind, senses and life, so the Lord governs as Mind of the mind,Sense of the sense, Life of the life, supporting His active divinity by Hissilent essential self-being, all cosmos and all form of being. As we have gonebehind the forms of the cosmos to that which is essential in their being andmovement and found our self and the gods, so we have to go behind our self andthe gods and find the one supreme Self and the one supreme Godhead. Then we cansay, “I think that I know.”But at once we have to qualify our assertion. I think not that I know perfectly,for that is impossible in the terms of our instruments of knowledge. I do notthink for a moment that I know the Unknowable, that that can be put into theforms through which I must arrive at the Self and Lord; but at the same time Iam no longer in ignorance, I know the Brahman in the only way in which I canknow Him, in His self-revelation to me in terms not beyond the grasp of mypsychology, manifest as the Self and the Lord. The mystery of existence isrevealed in a way that utterly satisfies my being because it enables me first tocomprehend it through these figures as far as it can be comprehended by me and,secondly, to enter into, to live in, to be one in law and being with and even tomerge myself in the Brahman.If we fancy that we have grasped the Brahman by the mind and in that delusionfix down our knowledge of Him to the terms our mentality has found, then ourknowledge is no knowledge; it is the little knowledge that turns to falsehood.So too those who try to fix Him into our notion of the fundamental ideas inwhich we discern Him by the thought that rises above ordinary mental perception,have no real discernment of the Brahman, since they take certain idea-symbolsfor the Reality. On the other hand if we recognise that our mental perceptionsare simply so many clues by which we can rise beyond mental perception and if weuse these fundamental idea-symbols and the arrangement of them which ouruttermost thought makes in order to go beyond the symbol to that reality, thenwe have rightly used mind and the higher discernment for their supreme purpose.Mind and the higher discernment are satisfied of the Brahman even in beingexceeded by Him.The mind can only reflect in a sort of supreme understanding and experience theform, the image of the supreme as He shows Himself to our mentality. Throughthis reflection we find, we know; the purpose of knowledge is accomplished, forwe find immortality, we enter into the law, the being, the beatitude of theBrahman-consciousness. By self-realisation of Brahman as our self we find theforce, the divine energy which lifts us beyond the limitation, weakness,darkness, sorrow, all-pervading death of our mortal existence; by the knowledgeof the one Brahman in all beings and in all the various movement of the cosmoswe attain beyond these things to the infinity, the omnipotent being, theomniscient light, the pure beatitude of that divine existence.This great achievement must be done here in this mortal world, in this limitedbody; for if we do it, we arrive at our true existence and are no longer bounddown to our phenomenal becoming. But if here we find it not, great is the lossand perdition; for we remain continually immersed in the phenomenal life of themind and body and do not rise above it into the true supramental existence. Nor,if we miss it here, will death give it to us by our passage to another and lessdifficult world. Only those who use their awakened self and enlightened powersto distinguish and discover that One and Immortal in all existences, theall-originating self, the all-inhabiting Lord, can make the real passage whichtranscends life and death, can pass out of this mortal status, can press beyondand rise upward into a world-transcending immortality.This, then, and no other is the means to be seized on and the goal to bereached. “There is no other path for the great journey.” The Self and the Lordare that indeterminable, unknowable, ineffable Parabrahman and when we seekrather that which is indeterminable and unknowable to us, it is still the Selfand the Lord always that we find, though by an attempt which is not the straightand possible road intended for the embodied soul seeking here to accomplish itstrue existence.[4] They are the self-manifested Reality which so places itselfbefore man as the object of his highest aspiration and the fulfilment of all hisactivities.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Ajñeyam atarkyam.[2] Avyavahāryam.[3] Chhandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads.[4] Gita."},{"pageContent":"THE PARABLE OF THE GODSFrom its assertion of the relative knowableness of the unknowable Brahman andthe justification of the soul’s aspiration towards that which is beyond itspresent capacity and status the Upanishad turns to the question of the means bywhich that high-reaching aspiration can put itself into relation with the objectof its search. How is the veil to be penetrated and the subject consciousness ofman to enter into the master-consciousness of the Lord? What bridge is thereover this gulf? Knowledge has already been pointed out as the supreme means opento us, a knowledge which begins by a sort of reflection of the true existence inthe awakened mental understanding. But Mind is one of the gods; the Light behindit is indeed the greatest of the gods, Indra. Then, an awakening of all the godsthrough their greatest to the essence of that which they are, the one Godheadwhich they represent. By the mentality opening itself to the Mind of our mind,the sense and speech also will open themselves to the Sense of our sense and tothe Word behind our speech and the life to the Life of our life. The Upanishadproceeds to develop this consequence of its central suggestion by a strikingparable or apologue.The gods, the powers that affirm the Good, the Light, the Joy and Beauty, theStrength and Mastery have found themselves victorious in their eternal battlewith the powers that deny. It is Brahman that has stood behind the gods andconquered for them; the Master of all who guides all has thrown His decidingwill into the balance, put down his darkened children and exalted the childrenof Light. In this victory of the Master of all the gods are conscious of amighty development of themselves, a splendid efflorescence of their greatness inman, their joy, their light, their glory, their power and pleasure. But theirvision is as yet sealed to their own deeper truth; they know of themselves, theyknow not the Eternal; they know the godheads, they do not know God. Thereforethey see the victory as their own, the greatness as their own. This opulentefflorescence of the gods and uplifting of their greatness and light is theadvance of man to his ordinary ideal of a perfectly enlightened mentality, astrong and sane vitality, a well-ordered body and senses, a harmonious, rich,active and happy life, the Hellenic ideal which the modern world holds to be ourultimate potentiality. When such an efflorescence takes place whether in theindividual or the kind, the gods in man grow luminous, strong, happy; they feelthey have conquered the world and they proceed to divide it among themselves andenjoy it.But such is not the full intention of Brahman in the universe or in thecreature. The greatness of the gods is His own victory and greatness, but it isonly given in order that man may grow nearer to the point at which his facultieswill be strong enough to go beyond themselves and realise the Transcendent.Therefore Brahman manifests Himself before the exultant gods in theirwell-ordered world and puts to them by His silence the heart-shaking, theworld-shaking question, “If ye are all, then what am I? for see, I am and I amhere.” Though He manifests, He does not reveal Himself, but is seen and felt bythem as a vague and tremendous presence, the Yaksha, the Daemon, the Spirit, theunknown Power, the Terrible beyond good and evil for whom good and evil areinstruments towards His final self-expression. Then there is alarm and confusionin the divine assembly; they feel a demand and a menace; on the side of the evilthe possibility of monstrous and appalling powers yet unknown and unmasteredwhich may wreck the fair world they have built, upheave and shatter to piecesthe brilliant harmony of the intellect, the aesthetic mind, the moral nature,the vital desires, the body and senses which they have with such labourestablished; on the side of the good the demand of things unknown which arebeyond all these and therefore are equally a menace, since the little which isrealised cannot stand against the much that is unrealised, cannot shut out thevast, the infinite that presses against the fragile walls we have erected todefine and shelter our limited being and pleasure. Brahman presents itself tothem as the Unknown; the gods knew not what was this Daemon.Therefore Agni first arises at their bidding to discover its nature, limits,identity. The gods of the Upanishad differ in one all-important respect from thegods of the Rig-veda; for the latter are not only powers of the One, butconscious of their source and true identity; they know the Brahman, they dwellin the supreme Godhead, their origin, home and proper plane is thesuperconscient Truth. It is true they manifest themselves in man in the form ofhuman faculties and assume the appearance of human limitations, manifestthemselves in the lower cosmos and assume the mould of its cosmic operations;but this is only their lesser and lower movement and beyond it they are for everthe One, the Transcendent and Wonderful, the Master of Force and Delight andKnowledge and Being. But in the Upanishads the Brahman idea has grown and castdown the gods from this high pre-eminence so that they appear only in theirlesser human and cosmic workings. Much of their other Vedic aspects they keep.Here the three gods Indra, Vayu, Agni represent the cosmic Divine on each of itsthree planes, Indra on the mental, Vayu on the vital, Agni on the material. Inthat order, therefore, beginning from the material they approach the Brahman.Agni is the heat and flame of the conscious force in Matter which has built upthe universe; it is he who has made life and mind possible and developed them inthe material universe where he is the greatest deity. Especially he is theprimary impeller of speech of which Vayu is the medium and Indra the lord. Thisheat of conscious force in Matter is Agni Jatavedas, the knower of all births:of all things born, of every cosmic phenomenon he knows the law, the process,the limit, the relation. If then it is some mighty Birth of the cosmos thatstands before them, some new indeterminate developed in the cosmic struggle andprocess, who shall know him, determine his limits, strength, potentialities ifnot Agni Jatavedas?Full of confidence he rushes towards the object of his search and is met by thechallenge, “Who art thou? What is the force in thee?” His name is AgniJatavedas, the Power that is at the basis of all birth and process in thematerial universe and embraces and knows their workings and the force in him isthis that all that is thus born, he as the flame of Time and Death can devour.All things are his food which he assimilates and turns into material of newbirth and formation. But this all-devourer cannot devour with all his force afragile blade of grass so long as it has behind it the power of the Eternal.Agni is compelled to return, not having discovered. One thing only is settledthat this Daemon is no Birth of the material cosmos, no transient thing that issubject to the flame and breath of Time; it is too great for Agni.Another god rises to the call. It is Vayu Matarishwan, the great Life-Principle,he who moves, breathes, expands infinitely in the mother element. All things inthe universe are the movement of this mighty Life; it is he who has brought Agniand placed him secretly in all existence; for him the worlds have been upbuildedthat Life may move in them, that it may act, that it may riot and enjoy. If thisDaemon be no birth of Matter, but some stupendous Life-force active whether inthe depths or on the heights of being, who shall know it, who shall seize it inhis universal expansion if not Vayu Matarishwan?There is the same confident advance upon the object, the same formidablechallenge, “Who art thou? What is the force in thee?” This is Vayu Matarishwanand the power in him is this that he, the Life, can take all things in hisstride and growth and seize on them for his mastery and enjoyment. But even theveriest frailest trifle he cannot seize and master so long as it is protectedagainst him by the shield of the Omnipotent. Vayu too returns, not havingdiscovered. One thing only is settled that this is no form or force of cosmicLife which operates within the limits of the all-grasping vital impulse; it istoo great for Vayu.Indra next arises, the Puissant, the Opulent. Indra is the power of the Mind;the senses which the Life uses for enjoyment, are operations of Indra which heconducts for knowledge and all things that Agni has upbuilt and supports anddestroys in the universe are Indra’s field and the subject of his functioning.If then this unknown Existence is something that the senses can grasp or, if itis something that the mind can envisage, Indra shall know it and make it part ofhis opulent possessions. But it is nothing that the senses can grasp or the mindenvisage, for as soon as Indra approaches it, it vanishes. The mind can onlyenvisage what is limited by Time and Space and this Brahman is that which, asthe Rig-veda has said, is neither today nor tomorrow and though it moves and canbe approached in the conscious being of all conscious existences, yet when themind tries to approach it and study it in itself, it vanishes from the view ofthe mind. The Omnipresent cannot be seized by the senses, the Omniscient cannotbe known by the mentality.But Indra does not turn back from the quest like Agni and Vayu; he pursues hisway through the highest ether of the pure mentality and there he approaches theWoman, the many-shining, Uma Haimavati; from her he learns that this Daemon isthe Brahman by whom alone the gods of mind and life and body conquer and affirmthemselves, and in whom alone they are great. Uma is the supreme Nature fromwhom the whole cosmic action takes its birth; she is the pure summit and highestpower of the One who here shines out in many forms. From this supreme Naturewhich is also the supreme Consciousness the gods must learn their own truth;they must proceed by reflecting it in themselves instead of limiting themselvesto their own lower movement. For she has the knowledge and consciousness of theOne, while the lower nature of mind, life and body can only envisage the many.Although therefore Indra, Vayu and Agni are the greatest of the gods, the firstcoming to know the existence of the Brahman, the others approaching and feelingthe touch of it, yet it is only by entering into contact with the supremeconsciousness and reflecting its nature and by the elimination of the vital,mental, physical egoism so that their whole function shall be to reflect the Oneand Supreme that Brahman can be known by the gods in us and possessed. Theconscious force that supports our embodied life must become simply and purely areflector of that supreme Consciousness and Power of which its highest ordinaryaction is only a twilight figure; the Life must become a passively potentreflection and pure image of that supreme Life which is greater than all ourutmost actual and potential vitality; the Mind must resign itself to be no morethan a faithful mirror of the image of the superconscient Existence. By thisconscious surrender of mind, life and senses to the Master of our senses, lifeand mind who alone really governs their action, by this turning of the cosmicexistence into a passive reflection of the eternal being and a faithfulreproductor of the nature of the Eternal we may hope to know and throughknowledge to rise into that which is superconscient to us; we shall enter intothe Silence that is master of an eternal, infinite, free and all-blissfulactivity."},{"pageContent":"THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE SELF AND THE GODSThe means of the knowledge of Brahman are, we have seen, to get back behind theforms of the universe to that which is essential in the cosmos, — and that whichis essential is twofold, the gods in Nature and the self in the individual, —and then to get behind these to the Beyond which they represent. The practicalrelation of the gods to Brahman in this process of divine knowledge has beenalready determined. The cosmic functionings through which the gods act, mind,life, speech, senses, body, must become aware of something beyond them whichgoverns them, by which they are and move, by whose force they evolve, enlargethemselves and arrive at power and joy and capacity; to that they must turn fromtheir ordinary operations; leaving these, leaving the false idea of independentaction and self-ordering which is an egoism of mind and life and sense they mustbecome consciously passive to the power, light and joy of something which isbeyond themselves. What happens then is that this divine Unnameable reflectsHimself openly in the gods. His light takes possession of the thinking mind, Hispower and joy of the life, His light and rapture of the emotional mind and thesenses. Something of the supreme image of Brahman falls upon the world-natureand changes it into divine nature.All this is not done by a sudden miracle. It comes by flashes, revelations,sudden touches and glimpses; there is as if a leap of the lightning ofrevelation flaming out from those heavens for a moment and then returning intoits secret source; as if the lifting of the eyelid of an inner vision and itsfalling again because the eye cannot look long and steadily on the utter light.The repetition of these touches and visitings from the Beyond fixes the gods intheir upward gaze and expectation, constant repetition fixes them in a constantpassivity; not moving out any longer to grasp at the forms of the universe mind,life and senses will more and more be fixed in the memory, in the understanding,in the joy of the touch and vision of that transcendent glory which they havenow resolved to make their sole object; to that only they will learn to respondand not to the touches of outward things. The silence which has fallen on themand which is now their foundation and status will become their knowledge of theeternal silence which is Brahman; the response of their functioning to asupernal light, power, joy will become their knowledge of the eternal activitywhich is Brahman. Other status, other response and activity they will not know.The mind will know nothing but the Brahman, think of nothing but the Brahman,the Life will move to, embrace, enjoy nothing but the Brahman, the eye will see,the ear hear, the other senses sense nothing but the Brahman.But is then a complete oblivion of the external the goal? Must the mind andsenses recede inward and fall into an unending trance and the life be for everstilled? This is possible, if the soul so wills, but it is not inevitable andindispensable. The Mind is cosmic, one in all the universe; so too are the Life,and the Sense, so too is Matter of the body; and when they exist in and for theBrahman only, they will not only know this but will sense, feel and live in thatuniversal unity. Therefore to whatever thing they turn which to the individualsense and mind and life seems now external to them, there also it is not themere form of things which they will know, think of, sense, embrace and enjoy,but always and only the Brahman. Moreover, the external will cease to exist forthem, because nothing will be external but all things internal to us, even thewhole world and all that is in it. For the limit of ego, the wall ofindividuality will break; the individual Mind will cease to know itself asindividual, it will be conscious only of universal Mind one everywhere in whichindividuals are only knots of the one mentality; so the individual life willlose its sense of separateness and live only in and as the one life in which allindividuals are simply whirls of the indivisible flood of Pranic activity; thevery body and senses will be no longer conscious of a separated existence, butthe real body which the man will feel himself to be physically will be the wholeEarth and the whole universe and the whole indivisible form of thingswheresoever existent, and the senses also will be converted to this principle ofsensation so that even in what we call the external, the eye will see Brahmanonly in every sight, the ear will hear Brahman only in every sound, the innerand outer body will feel Brahman only in every touch and the touch itself as ifinternal in the greater body. The soul whose gods are thus converted to thissupreme law and religion, will realise in the cosmos itself and in all itsmultiplicity the truth of the One besides whom there is no other or second.Moreover, becoming one with the formless and infinite, it will exceed theuniverse itself and see all the worlds not as external, not even as commensuratewith itself, but as if within it.And in fact, in the higher realisation it will not be Mind, Life, Sense of whicheven the mind, life and sense themselves will be originally aware, but ratherthat which constitutes them. By this process of constant visiting and divinetouch and influence the Mind of the mind, that is to say, the superconscientKnowledge will take possession of the mental understanding and begin to turn allits vision and thinking into luminous stuff and vibration of light of theSupermind. So too the sense will be changed by the visitings of the Sense behindthe sense and the whole sense-view of the universe itself will be altered sothat the vital, mental and supramental will become visible to the senses withthe physical only as their last, outermost and smallest result. So too the Lifewill become a superlife, a conscious movement of the infinite Conscious-Force;it will be impersonal, unlimited by any particular acts and enjoyment, unboundto their results, untroubled by the dualities or the touch of sin and suffering,grandiose, boundless, immortal. The material world itself will become for thesegods a figure of the infinite, luminous and blissful Superconscient.This will be the transfiguration of the gods, but what of the self? For we haveseen that there are two fundamental entities, the gods and the self, and theself in us is greater than the cosmic Powers, its Godward destination more vitalto our perfection and self-fulfilment than any transfiguration of these lesserdeities. Therefore not only must the gods find their one Godhead and resolvethemselves into it; that is to say, not only must the cosmic principles workingin us resolve themselves into the working of the One, the Principle of allprinciples, so that they shall become only a unified existence and single actionof That in spite of all play of differentiation, but also and with a morefundamental necessity the self in us which supports the action of the gods mustfind and enter into the one Self of all individual existences, the indivisibleSpirit to whom all souls are no more than dark or luminous centres of itsconsciousness.This the self of man, since it is the essentiality of a mental being, will dothrough the mind. In the gods the transfiguration is effected by theSuperconscient itself visiting their substance and opening their vision with itsflashes until it has transformed them; but the mind is capable of another actionwhich is only apparently movement of mind, but really the movement of the selftowards its own reality. The mind seems to go to That, to attain to it; it islifted out of itself into something beyond and, although it falls back, still bythe mind the will of knowledge in the mental thought continually and at lastcontinuously remembers that into which it has entered. On this the Self throughthe mind seizes and repeatedly dwells and so doing it is finally caught up intoit and at last able to dwell securely in that transcendence. It transcends themind, it transcends its own mental individualisation of the being, that which itnow knows as itself; it ascends and takes foundation in the Self of all and inthe status of self-joyous infinity which is the supreme manifestation of theSelf. This is the transcendent immortality, this is the spiritual existencewhich the Upanishads declare to be the goal of man and by which we pass out ofthe mortal state into the heaven of the Spirit.What then happens to the gods and the cosmos and all that the Lord develops inHis being? Does it not all disappear? Is not the transfiguration of the godseven a mere secondary state through which we pass towards that culmination andwhich drops away from us as soon as we reach it? And with the disappearance ofthe gods and the cosmos does not the Lord too, the Master-Consciousness,disappear so that nothing is left but the one pure indeterminate Existenceself-blissful in an eternal inaction and non-creation? Such was the conclusionof the later Vedanta in its extreme monistic form and such was the sense whichit tried to read into all the Upanishads; but it must be recognised that in thelanguage whether of the Isha or the Kena Upanishad there is absolutely nothing,not even a shade or a nuance pointing to it. If we want to find it there, wehave to put it in by force; for the actual language used favours instead theconclusion of other Vedantic systems, which considered the goal to be theeternal joy of the soul in a Brahmaloka or world of the Brahman in which it isone with the infinite existence and yet in a sense still a soul able to enjoydifferentiation in the oneness.In the next verse we have the culmination of the teaching of the Upanishad, theresult of the great transcendence which it has been setting forth and afterwardsthe description of the immortality to which the souls of knowledge attain whenthey pass beyond the mortal status. It declares that Brahman is in its nature“That Delight,” Tadvanam. “Vana” is the Vedic word for delight or delightful,and “Tadvanam” means therefore the transcendent Delight, the all-blissful Anandaof which the Taittiriya Upanishad speaks as the highest Brahman from which allexistences are born, by which all existences live and increase and into whichall existences arrive in their passing out of death and birth. It is as thistranscendent Delight that the Brahman must be worshipped and sought. It is thisbeatitude therefore which is meant by the immortality of the Upanishads. Andwhat will be the result of knowing and possessing Brahman as the supreme Ananda?It is that towards the knower and possessor of the Brahman is directed thedesire of all creatures. In other words, he becomes a centre of the divineDelight shedding it on all the world and attracting all to it as to a fountainof joy and love and self-fulfilment in the universe.This is the culmination of the teaching of the Upanishad; there was a demand forthe secret teaching that enters into the ultimate truth, for the “Upanishad”,and in response this doctrine has been given. It has been uttered, the Upanishadof the Brahman, the hidden ultimate truth of the supreme Existence; itsbeginning was the search for the Lord, Master of mind, life, speech and sensesin whom is the absolute of mind, the absolute of life, the absolute of speechand senses and its close is the finding of Him as the transcendent Beatitude andthe elevation of the soul that finds and possesses it into a living centre ofthat Delight towards which all creatures in the universe shall turn as to afountain of its ecstasies. ***The Upanishad closes with two verses which seem to review and characterise thewhole work in the manner of the ancient writings when they have drawn to theirclose. This Upanishad or gospel of the inmost Truth of things has for itsfoundation, it is said, the practice of self-mastery, action and the subdual ofthe sense-life to the power of the Spirit. In other words, life and works are tobe used as a means of arriving out of the state of subjection proper to the soulin the ignorance into a state of mastery which brings it nearer to the absoluteself-mastery and all-mastery of the supreme Soul seated in the knowledge. TheVedas, that is to say, the utterances of the inspired seers and the truths theyhold, are described as all the limbs of the Upanishad; in other words, all theconvergent lines and aspects, all the necessary elements of this great practice,this profound psychological self-training and spiritual aspiration are set forthin these great Scriptures, channels of supreme knowledge and indicators of asupreme discipline. Truth is its home; and this Truth is not merely intellectualverity, — for that is not the sense of the word in the Vedic writings, — butman’s ultimate human state of true being, true consciousness, right knowledge,right works, right joy of existence, all indeed that is contrary to thefalsehood of egoism and ignorance. It is by these means, by using works andself-discipline for mastery of oneself and for the generation of spiritualenergy, by fathoming in all its parts the knowledge and repeating the highexample of the great Vedic seers and by living in the Truth that one becomescapable of the great ascent which the Upanishad opens to us.The goal of the ascent is the world of the true and vast existence of which theVeda speaks as the Truth that is the final goal and home of man. It is describedhere as the greater infinite heavenly world, (Swargaloka, Swarloka of the Veda),which is not the lesser Swarga of the Puranas or the lesser Brahmaloka of theMundaka Upanishad, its world of the sun’s rays to which the soul arrives byworks of virtue and piety, but falls from them by the exhaustion of their merit;it is the higher Swarga or Brahman-world of the Katha which is beyond the dualsymbols of birth and death, the higher Brahman-worlds of the Mundaka which thesoul enters by knowledge and renunciation. It is therefore a state not belongingto the Ignorance, but to Knowledge. It is, in fact, the infinite existence andbeatitude of the soul in the being of the all-blissful existence; it is too thehigher status, the light of the Mind beyond the mind, the joy and eternalmastery of the Life beyond the life, the riches of the Sense beyond the senses.And the soul finds in it not only its own largeness but finds too and possessesthe infinity of the One and it has firm foundation in that immortal statebecause there a supreme Silence and eternal Peace are the secure foundation ofeternal Knowledge and absolute Joy."},{"pageContent":"A LAST WORDWe have now completed our review of this Upanishad; we have considered minutelythe bearings of its successive utterances and striven to make as precise as wecan to the intelligence the sense of the puissant phrases in which it gives usits leading clues to that which can never be entirely expressed by human speech.We have some idea of what it means by that Brahman, by the Mind of mind, theLife of life, the Sense of sense, the Speech of speech, by the opposition ofourselves and the gods, by the Unknowable who is yet not utterly unknowable tous, by the transcendence of the mortal state and the conquest of immortality.Fundamentally its teaching reposes on the assertion of three states ofexistence, the human and mortal, the Brahman-consciousness which is the absoluteof our relativities, and the utter Absolute which is unknowable. The first is ina sense a false status of misrepresentation because it is a continual term ofapparent opposites and balancings where the truth of things is a secret unity;we have here a bright or positive figure and a dark or negative figure and bothare figures, neither the Truth; still in that we now live and through that wehave to move to the Beyond. The second is the Lord of all this dual action whois beyond it; He is the truth of Brahman and not in any way a falsehood ormisrepresentation, but the truth of it as attained by us in our eternalsupramental being; in Him are the absolutes of all that here we experience inpartial figures. The Unknowable is beyond our grasp because though it is thesame Reality, yet it exceeds even our highest term of eternal being and isbeyond Existence and Non-existence; it is therefore to the Brahman, the Lord whohas a relation to what we are that we must direct our search if we would attainbeyond what temporarily seems to what eternally is.The attainment of the Brahman is our escape from the mortal status intoImmortality, by which we understand not the survival of death, but the findingof our true self of eternal being and bliss beyond the dual symbols of birth anddeath. By immortality we mean the absolute life of the soul as opposed to thetransient and mutable life in the body which it assumes by birth and death andrebirth and superior also to its life as the mere mental being who dwells in theworld subjected helplessly to this law of death and birth or seems at least byhis ignorance to be subjected to this and to other laws of the lower Nature. Toknow and possess its true nature, free, absolute, master of itself and itsembodiments is the soul’s means of transcendence, and to know and possess thisis to know and possess the Brahman. It is also to rise out of mortal world intoimmortal world, out of world of bondage into world of largeness, out of finiteworld into infinite world. It is to ascend out of earthly joy and sorrow into atranscendent Beatitude.This must be done by the abandonment of our attachment to the figure of thingsin the mortal world. We must put from us its death and dualities if we wouldcompass the unity and immortality. Therefore it follows that we must cease tomake the goods of this world or even its right, light and beauty our object ofpursuit; we must go beyond these to a supreme Good, a transcendent Truth, Lightand Beauty in which the opposite figures of what we call evil disappear. Butstill, being in this world, it is only through something in this world itselfthat we can transcend it; it is through its figures that we must find theabsolute. Therefore, we scrutinise them and perceive that there are first theseforms of mind, life, speech and sense, all of them figures and imperfectsuggestions, and then behind them the cosmic principles through which the Oneacts. It is to these cosmic principles that we must proceed and turn them fromtheir ordinary aim and movement in the world to find their own supreme aim andabsolute movement in their own one Godhead, the Lord, the Brahman; they must bedrawn to leave the workings of ordinary mind and find the superconscient Mind,to leave the workings of ordinary speech and sense and find the supramentalSense and original Word, to leave the apparent workings of mundane Life and findthe transcendent Life.Besides the gods, there is our self, the spirit within who supports all thisaction of the gods. Our spirit too must turn from its absorption in its figureof itself as it sees it involved in the movement of individual life, mind, bodyand subject to it and must direct its gaze upward to its own supreme Self who isbeyond all this movement and master of it all. Therefore the mind must indeedbecome passive to the divine Mind, the sense to the divine Sense, the life tothe divine Life and by receptivity to constant touches and visitings of thehighest be transfigured into a reflection of these transcendences; but also theindividual self must through the mind’s aspiration upwards, through upliftingsof itself beyond, through constant memory of the supreme Reality in which duringthese divine moments it has lived, ascend finally into that Bliss and Power andLight.But this will not necessarily mean the immersion into an all-oblivious Beingeternally absorbed in His own inactive self-existence. For the mind, sense, lifegoing beyond their individual formations find that they are only one centre ofthe sole Mind, Life, Form of things and therefore they find Brahman in that alsoand not only in an individual transcendence; they bring down the vision of thesuperconscient into that also and not only into their own individual workings.The mind of the individual escapes from its limits and becomes the one universalmind, his life the one universal life, his bodily sense the sense of the wholeuniverse and even more as his own indivisible Brahman-body. He perceives theuniverse in himself and he perceives also his self in all existences and knowsit to be the one, the omnipresent, the single-multiple all-inhabiting Lord andReality. Without this realisation he has not fulfilled the conditions ofimmortality. Therefore it is said that what the sages seek is to distinguish andsee the Brahman in all existences; by that discovery, realisation and possessionof Him everywhere and in all they attain to their immortal existence.Still although the victory of the gods, that is to say, the progressiveperfection of the mind, life, body in the positive terms of good, right, joy,knowledge, power is recognised as a victory of the Brahman and the necessity ofusing life and human works in the world as a means of preparation andself-mastery is admitted, yet a final passing away into the infinite heavenlyworld or status of the Brahman-consciousness is held out as the goal. And thiswould seem to imply a rejection of the life of the cosmos. Well then may we ask,we the modern humanity more and more conscious of the inner warning of thatwhich created us, be it Nature or God, that there is a work for the race, adivine purpose in its creation which exceeds the salvation of the individualsoul, because the universal is as real or even more real than the individual, wewho feel more and more, in the language of the Koran, that the Lord did notcreate heaven and earth in a jest, that Brahman did not begin dreaming thisworld-dream in a moment of aberration and delirium, — well may we ask whetherthis gospel of individual salvation is all the message even of this purer,earlier, more catholic Vedanta. If so, then Vedanta at its best is a gospel forthe saint, the ascetic, the monk, the solitary, but it has not a message whichthe widening consciousness of the world can joyfully accept as the word forwhich it was waiting. For there is evidently something vital that has escapedit, a profound word of the riddle of existence from which it has turned its eyesor which it was unable or thought it not worth while to solve.Now certainly there is an emphasis in the Upanishads increasing steadily as timegoes on into an over-emphasis, on the salvation of the individual, on hisrejection of the lower cosmic life. This note increases in them as they becomelater in date, it swells afterwards into the rejection of all cosmic lifewhatever and that becomes finally in later Hinduism almost the one dominant andall-challenging cry. It does not exist in the earlier Vedic revelation whereindividual salvation is regarded as a means towards a great cosmic victory, theeventual conquest of heaven and earth by the superconscient Truth and Bliss andthose who have achieved the victory in the past are the conscious helpers oftheir yet battling posterity. If this earlier note is missing in the Upanishads,then, — for great as are these Scriptures, luminous, profound, sublime in theirunsurpassed truth, beauty and power, yet it is only the ignorant soul that willmake itself the slave of a book, — then in using them as an aid to knowledge wemust insistently call back that earlier missing note, we must seek elsewhere asolution for the word of the riddle that has been ignored. The Upanishad aloneof extant scriptures gives us without veil or stinting, with plenitude and anoble catholicity the truth of the Brahman; its aid to humanity is thereforeindispensable. Only, where anything essential is missing, we must go beyond theUpanishads to seek it, — as for instance when we add to its emphasis on divineknowledge the indispensable ardent emphasis of the later teachings upon divinelove and the high emphasis of the Veda upon divine works.The Vedic gospel of a supreme victory in heaven and on earth for the divine inman, the Christian gospel of a kingdom of God and divine city upon earth, thePuranic idea of progressing Avataras ending in the kingdom of the perfect andthe restoration of the Golden Age, not only contain behind their forms aprofound truth, but they are necessary to the religious sense in mankind.Without it the teaching of the vanity of human life and of a passionate fleeingand renunciation can only be powerful in passing epochs or else on the fewstrong souls in each age that are really capable of these things. The rest ofhumanity will either reject the creed which makes that its foundation or ignoreit in practice while professing it in precept or else must sink under the weightof its own impotence and the sense of the illusion of life or of the curse ofGod upon the world as mediaeval Christendom sank into ignorance and obscurantismor later India into stagnant torpor and the pettiness of a life of aimlessegoism. The promise for the individual is well, but the promise for the race isalso needed. Our father Heaven must remain bright with the hope of deliverance,but also our mother Earth must not feel herself for ever accursed.It was necessary at one time to insist even exclusively on the idea ofindividual salvation so that the sense of a Beyond might be driven into man’smentality, as it was necessary at one time to insist on a heaven of joys for thevirtuous and pious so that man might be drawn by that shining bait towards thepractice of religion and the suppression of his unbridled animality. But as thelures of earth have to be conquered, so also have the lures of heaven. The lureof a pleasant Paradise of the rewards of virtue has been rejected by man; theUpanishads belittled it ages ago in India and it is now no longer dominant inthe mind of the people; the similar lure in popular Christianity and popularIslam has no meaning for the conscience of modern humanity. The lure of arelease from birth and death and withdrawal from the cosmic labour must also berejected, as it was rejected by Mahayanist Buddhism which held compassion andhelpfulness to be greater than Nirvana. As the virtues we practise must be donewithout demand of earthly or heavenly reward, so the salvation we seek must bepurely internal and impersonal; it must be the release from egoism, the unionwith the Divine, the realisation of our universality as well as ourtranscendence, and no salvation should be valued which takes us away from thelove of God in his manifestation and the help we can give to the world. If needbe, it must be taught for a time, “Better this hell with our other sufferingselves than a solitary salvation.”Fortunately, there is no need to go to such lengths and deny one side of thetruth in order to establish another. The Upanishad itself suggests the door ofescape from any over-emphasis in its own statement of the truth. For the man whoknows and possesses the supreme Brahman as the transcendent Beatitude becomes acentre of that delight to which all his fellows shall come, a well from whichthey can draw the divine waters. Here is the clue that we need. The connectionwith the universe is preserved for the one reason which supremely justifies thatconnection; it must subsist not from the desire of personal earthly joy, as withthose who are still bound, but for help to all creatures. Two then are theobjects of the high-reaching soul, to attain the Supreme and to be for ever forthe good of all the world, — even as Brahman Himself; whether here or elsewhere,does not essentially matter. Still where the struggle is thickest, there shouldbe the hero of the spirit, that is surely the highest choice of the son ofImmortality; the earth calls most, because it has most need of him, to the soulthat has become one with the universe.And the nature of the highest good that can be done is also indicated, — thoughother lower forms of help are not therefore excluded. To assist in the lesservictories of the gods which must prepare the supreme victory of the Brahman maywell be and must be in some way or other a part of our task; but the greatesthelpfulness of all is this, to be a human centre of the Light, the Glory, theBliss, the Strength, the Knowledge of the Divine Existence, one through whom itshall communicate itself lavishly to other men and attract by its magnet ofdelight their souls to that which is the Highest."},{"pageContent":" MUNDAKA UPANISHAD"},{"pageContent":"FIRST MUNDAKACHAPTER Ibrahmā devānāṁ prathamaḥ sambabhūva viśvasya kartā bhuvanasya goptā ǀsa brahmavidyāṁ sarvavidyāpratiṣṭhāmatharvāya jyeṣṭhaputrāya prāha ǁ1.

Butthis is not what the Sruti says."},{"pageContent":" READINGS IN THE TAITTIRIYA UPANISHAD"},{"pageContent":"THE KNOWLEDGE OF BRAHMANThe knower of Brahman reacheth that which is supreme.This is that verse which was spoken; “Truth, Knowledge, Infinity the Brahman,He who knoweth that hidden in the secrecy in the supreme ether,Enjoyeth all desires along with the wise-thinking Brahman. ” This is the burden of the opening sentences of the Taittiriya Upanishad's secondsection; they begin its elucidation of the highest truth. Or in the Sanskrit, brahmavid āpnoti param —tad eṣābhyuktā — satyam jñānam anantam brahma —yo veda nihitam guhāyām — parame vyoman —so' śnute sarvān kāmān — saha brahmaṇā vipaściteti. But what is Brahman?Whatever reality is in existence, by which all the rest subsists, that isBrahman. An Eternal behind all instabilities, a Truth of things which isimplied, if it is hidden in all appearances, a Constant which supports allmutations, but is not increased, diminished, abrogated, — there is such anunknown X which makes existence a problem, our own self a mystery, the universea riddle. If we were only what we seem to be to our normal self-awareness, therewould be no mystery; if the world were only what it can be made out to be by theperceptions of the senses and their strict analysis in the reason, there wouldbe no riddle; and if to take our life as it is now and the world as it has sofar developed to our experience were the whole possibility of our knowing anddoing, there would be no problem. Or at best there would be but a shallowmystery, an easily solved riddle, the problem only of a child's puzzle. Butthere is more, and that more is the hidden head of the Infinite and the secretheart of the Eternal. It is the highest and this highest is the all; there isnone beyond and there is none other than it. To know it is to know the highestand by knowing the highest to know all. For as it is the beginning and source ofall things, so everything else is its consequence; as it is the support andconstituent of all things, so the secret of everything else is explained by itssecret; as it is the sum and end of all things, so everything else amounts to itand by throwing itself into it achieves the sense of its own existence.This is the Brahman.* * *If this unknown be solely an indecipherable, only indefinable X, always unknownand unknowable, the hidden never revealed, the secret never opened to us, thenour mystery would for ever remain a mystery, our riddle insoluble, our problemintangible. Its existence, even while it determines all we are, know and do,could yet make no practical difference to us; for our relation to it would thenbe a blind and helpless dependence, a relation binding us to ignorance andmaintainable only by that ignorance. Or again, if it be in some way knowable,but the sole result of knowledge were an extinction or cessation of our being,then within our being it could have no consequences; the very act andfructuation of knowledge would bring the annihilation of all that we now are,not its completion or fulfilment. The mystery, riddle, problem would not be somuch solved as abolished, for it would lose all its data. In effect we shouldhave to suppose that there is an eternal and irreconcilable opposition betweenBrahman and what we now are, between the supreme cause and all its effects orbetween the supreme source and all its derivations. And it would then seem thatall that the Eternal originates, all he supports, all he takes back to himselfis a denial or contradiction of his being which, though in itself a negative ofthat which alone is, has yet in some way become a positive. The two could notcoexist in consciousness; if he allowed the world to know him, it woulddisappear from being.But the Eternal is knowable, He defines himself so that we may seize him, andman can become, even while he exists as man and in this world and in this body,a knower of the Brahman.The knowledge of the Brahman is not a thing luminous but otiose, informing tothe intellectual view of things but without consequence to the soul of theindividual or his living; it is a knowledge that is a power and a divinecompulsion to change; by it his existence gains something that now he does notpossess in consciousness. What is this gain? it is this that he is conscious nowof a lower state only of his being, but by knowledge he gains his highest being.The highest state of our being is not a denial, contradiction and annihilationof all that we now are; it is a supreme accomplishment of all things that ourpresent existence means and aims at, but in their highest sense and in theeternal values.* * *To live in our present state of self-consciousness is to live and to act inignorance. We are ignorant of ourselves, because we know as yet only that in uswhich changes always, from moment to moment, from hour to hour, from period toperiod, from life to life, and not that in us which is eternal. We are ignorantof the world because we do not know God; we are aware of the law of appearances,but not of the law and truth of being.Our highest wisdom, our minutest most accurate science, our most effectiveapplication of knowledge can be at most a thinning of the veil of ignorance, butnot a going beyond it, so long as we do not get at the fundamental knowledge andthe consciousness to which that is native. The rest are effective for their owntemporal purposes, but prove ineffective in the end, because they do not bringto the highest good; they lead to no permanent solution of the problem ofexistence.The ignorance in which we live is not a baseless and wholesale falsehood, but atits lowest the misrepresentation of a Truth, at its highest an imperfectrepresentation and translation into inferior and to that extent misleadingvalues. It is a knowledge of the superficial only and therefore a missing of thesecret essential which is the key to all that the superficial is striving for; aknowledge of the finite and apparent, but a missing of all that the apparentsymbolises and the finite suggests; a knowledge of inferior forms, but a missingof all that our inferior life and being has above it and to which it must aspireif it is to fulfil its greatest possibilities. The true knowledge is that of thehighest, the inmost, the infinite. The knower of the Brahman sees all theselower things in the light of the Highest, the external and superficial as atranslation of the internal and essential, the finite from the view of theInfinite. He begins to see and know existence no longer as the thinking animal,but as the Eternal sees and knows it. Therefore he is glad and rich in being,luminous in joy, satisfied of existence.* * *Knowledge does not end with knowing, nor is it pursued and found for the sake ofknowing alone. It has its full value only when it leads to some greater gainthan itself, some gain of being. Simply to know the eternal and to remain in thepain, struggle and inferiority of our present way of being, would be a poor andlame advantage.A greater knowledge opens the possibility and, if really possessed, brings theactuality of a greater being. To be is the first verb which contains all theothers; knowledge, action, creation, enjoyment are only a fulfilment of being.Since we are incomplete in being, to grow is our aim, and that knowledge,action, creation, enjoyment are the best which most help us to expand, grow,feel our existence.Mere existence is not fullness of being. Being knows itself as power,consciousness, delight; a greater being means a greater power, consciousness anddelight.If by greater being we incurred only a greater pain and suffering, this goodwould not be worth having. Those who say that it is, mean simply that we get byit a greater sense of fulfilment which brings of itself a greater joy of thepower of existence, and an extension of suffering or a loss of other enjoymentis worth having as a price for this greater sense of wideness, height and power.But this could not be the perfection of being or the highest height of itsfulfilment; suffering is the seal of a lower status. The highest consciousnessis integrally fulfilled in wideness and power of its existence, but also it isintegrally fulfilled in delight.The knower of Brahman has not only the joy of light, but gains something immenseas the result of his knowledge, brahmavid apnoti.What he gains is that highest, that which is supreme; he gains the highestbeing, the highest consciousness, the highest wideness and power of being, thehighest delight; brahmavid āpnoti param.* * *The Supreme is not something aloof and shut up in itself. It is not a mereindefinable, prisoner of its own featureless absoluteness, impotent to define,create, know itself variously, eternally buried in a sleep or a swoon ofself-absorption. The Highest is the Infinite and the Infinite contains the All.Whoever attains the highest consciousness, becomes infinite in being andembraces the All.To make this clear the Upanishad has defined the Brahman as the Truth,Knowledge, Infinity and has defined the result of the knowledge of Him in thesecrecy, in the cave of being, in the supreme ether as the enjoyment of all itsdesires by the soul of the individual in the attainment of its highestself-existence.Our highest state of being is indeed a becoming one with Brahman in his eternityand infinity, but it is also an association with him in delight ofself-fulfilment, aśnute saha brahmaṇā. And that principle of the Eternal bywhich this association is possible, is the principle of his knowledge, hisself-discernment and all-discernment, the wisdom by which he knows himselfperfectly in all the world and all beings, brahmaṇā vipaścitā.Delight of being is the continent of all the fulfilled values of existence whichwe now seek after in the forms of desire. To know its conditions and possess itpurely and perfectly is the infinite privilege of the eternal Wisdom."},{"pageContent":"TRUTH, KNOWLEDGE, INFINITYTruth, Knowledge, Infinity, not as three separate things, but in theirinseparable unity, are the supernal conscious being of the Eternal. It is aninfinite being, an infinite truth of being, an infinite self-knowledge ofself-being. Take one of these away and the idea of the Eternal fails us; we landourselves in half-lights, in dark or shining paradoxes without issue or in avain exaggeration and apotheosis of isolated intellectual conceptions.Infinity is the timeless and spaceless and causeless infinity of the eternalcontaining all the infinities of space and time and the endless succession whichhumanly we call causality. But in fact causality is only an inferior aspect andtranslation into mental and vital terms of something which is not mechanicalcausality, but the harmonies of a free self-determination of the being of theEternal.Truth is truth of the infinite and eternal, truth of being, and truth ofbecoming only as a self-expression of the being. The circumstances of theself-expression appear to the mind as the finite, but nothing is really finiteexcept the way the mind has of experiencing all that appears to its view. Allthings are, each thing is the Brahman.Knowledge is the Eternal’s inalienable self-knowledge of his infiniteself-existence and of all its truth and reality and, in that truth, of allthings as seen not by the mind, but by the self-view of the Spirit. Thisknowledge is not possible to the mind; it can only be reflected inadequately byit when it is touched by a ray from the secret luminous cavern of oursuperconscient being; yet of that ray we can make a shining ladder to climb intothe source of this supreme self-viewing wisdom.To know the eternal Truth, Knowledge, Infinity is to know the Brahman."},{"pageContent":"NOTE ON THE TEXTSThe translations and commentaries published here represent Sri Aurobindo’sUpanishadic interpretation in its most mature and finished form.
