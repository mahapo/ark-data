It first appeared in The Message of the Gita,edited by Anilbaran Roy, in 1938. Sri Aurobindo approved this book forpublication; however, he made it clear in one of his letters that thetranslations in the Essays were “more explanatory than textually precise or castin a literary style”. Many of them are paraphrases rather than stricttranslations. Sri Aurobindo also wrote that he did not wish extracts from theEssays “to go out as my translation of the Gita”. This should be borne in mindby the reader as he mattes use of this translation, which has been provided as abridge between the Gita and Sri Aurobindo’s Essays."},{"pageContent":"Table of ContentsNote on the Text [section-0003.html#auto_bookmark_table_of_contents_1]section-0003.html#auto_bookmark_table_of_contents_1 CHAPTER I.

Dhritarashtra said: On the field of Kurukshetra, the field of the working outof the Dharma, gathered together, eager for battle, what did they, O Sanjaya, mypeople and the Pandavas?2. Sanjaya said: Then the prince Duryodhana, having seen the army of thePandayas arrayed in battle order, approached his teacher and spoke these words:3. \"Behold this mighty host of the sons of Pandu, O Acharya, arrayed byDrupada's son, thy intelligent disciple.4-6. Here in this mighty army are heroes and great bowmen who are equal inbattle to Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada of the great car,Dhrishlaketu, Chekitana and the valiant prince of Kashi, Purujit and Kuntibhoja,and Shaibya, foremost among men; Yudhamanyu, the strong, and Uttamauja, thevictorious; Subhadra's son (Abhimanyu) and the sons of Draupadi; all of them ofgreat prowess.7. On our side also know those who are the most distinguished. O best of thetwice-born, the leaders of my army; these I name to thee for thy special notice.8-9. Thyself and Bhishma and Kama and Kripa, the victorious in battle,Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and Saumadatti also; and many other heroes have renouncedtheir life for my sake, they are all armed with diverse weapons and missiles andall well-skilled in war.10. Unlimited is this army of ours and it is marshalled by Bhishma, while thearmy of theirs is limited, and they depend on Bhima.11. Therefore all ye standing in your respective divisions in the differentfronts of the battle, guard Bhishma.\"12. Cheering the heart of Duryodhana. the mighty grandsire (Bhishma). theAncient of the Kurus, resounding the battlefield with a lion's roar, blew hisconch.13. Then conchs and kettledrums, tabors and drums and horns, suddenly blaredforth, and the clamour became tremendous.14. Then, seated in their great chariot, yoked to white horses. Madhava (SriKrishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna) blew their divine conchs.15-16. Hrishikesha (Krishna) blew his Panchajanya and Dhananjaya (Arjuna) hisDevadatta (god-given); Vrikodara of terrific deeds blew his mighty conch,Paundra; the King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew Anantavijaya, Nakula andSahadeva, Sughosha and Manipushpaka.17-18. And Kashya of the great bow, and Shikhandi of the great chariot,Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and Satyaki, the unconquered, Drupada, and the sons ofDraupadi, O Lord of earth, and Saubhadra, the mighty-armed, on all sides theirseveral conchs blew.19. That tumultuous uproar resounding through earth and sky tore the hearts ofthe sons of Dhritarashtra.20. Then, beholding the sons of Dhritarashtra standing in battle order, – andthe flight of missiles having begun, the son of Pandu (Arjuna), whose emblem isan ape, took up his bow and spoke this word to Hrishikesha, O Lord of earth:21-23. Arjuna said: O Achyuta (the faultless, the immovable), stay my chariotbetween the two armies, so that I may view these myriads standing, longing forbattle, whom I have to meet in this holiday of fight, and look upon those whohave come here to champion the cause of the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.24-25. Sanjaya said: Thus addressed by Gudakesha (one that has overcome sleep.Arjuna), Hrishikesha, O Bharata, having stayed that best of chariots between thetwo armies, in front of Bhishma, Drona and all the princes of earth, said: \"OPartha, behold these Kurus gathered together.\"26-27. Then saw Partha standing upon opposite sides, uncles and grandsires,teachers, mother's brothers, cousins, sons and grandsons, comrades,fathers-in-law, benefactors.27-28. Seeing all these kinsmen thus standing arrayed, Kaunteya, invaded bygreat pity, uttered this in sadness and dejection:28-30. Arjuna said: Seeing these my own people, O Krishna, arrayed for battle,my limbs collapse and my mouth is parched, my body shakes and my hair stands onend; Gandiva (Arjuna's bow) slips from my hand, and all my skin seems to beburning.30-31. I am not able to stand and my mind seems to be whirling; also I see evilomens, O Keshava.31-32. Nor do I see any good in slaying my own people in battle; O Krishna, Idesire not victory, nor kingdom, nor pleasures.32-36. What is kingdom to us, O Govinda, what enjoyment, what even life? Thosefor whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures, they stand here inbattle, abandoning life and riches – teachers, fathers, sons, as well asgrandsires, mother's brothers, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, andother kith and kin; these I would not consent to slay, though myself slain, OMadhusudana, even for the kingdom of the three worlds; how then for earth? Whatpleasures can be ours after killing the sons of Dhritarashtra. O Janardana?36-37. Sin will take hold of us in slaying them, though they are the aggressors.So it is not fit that we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, our kinsmen; indeed howmay we be happy, O Madhava, killing our own people?38-39. Although these, with a consciousness clouded with greed, see no guilt inthe destruction of the family, no crime in hostility to friends, why should notwe have the wisdom to draw hack from such a sin, O Janardana, we who see theevil in the destruction of the family?40. In the annihilation of the family the eternal traditions of the family aredestroyed; in the collapse of traditions, lawlessness overcomes the wholefamily,41. Owing to predominance of lawlessness, O Krishna, the women of the familybecome corrupt; women corrupted, O Varshneya, the confusion of the Varnasarises.42. This confusion leads to hell the ruiners of the family, and the family; fortheir ancestors fall, deprived of pinda (rice offering) and libations.43. By these misdeeds of the ruiners of the family leading to the confusion ofthe orders, the eternal laws of the race and moral law of the family aredestroyed.44. And men whose family morals are corrupted, O Janardana, live for ever inhell. Thus have we heard.45. Alas! we were engaged in committing a great sin, we who were endeavouring tokill our own people through greed of the pleasures of kingship.46. It is more for my welfare that the sons of Dhritarashtra armed should slayme unarmed and unresisting. (I will not fight.)47. Sanjaya said: Having thus spoken on the battlefield, Arjuna sank down on theseat of the chariot, casting down the divine bow and the inexhaustible quiver(given to him by the gods for that tremendous hour), his spirit overwhelmed withsorrow."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IISANKHYAYOGA(2. SANKHYA-YOGA)1. Sanjaya said: To him thus invaded by pity, his eyes full and distressed withtears, his heart overcome by depression and discouragement, Madhusudana spokethese words.2. The Blessed Lord said: Whence has come to thee this dejection, this stain anddarkness of the soul in the hour of difficulty and peril, O Arjuna? This is notthe way cherished by the Aryan man: this mood came not from heaven nor can itlead to heaven, and on earth it is the forfeiting of glory.3. Fall not from the virility of the fighter and the hero, O Partha! it is notfitting in thee. Shake off this paltry faintheartedness and arise, O scourge ofthine enemy!4. Arjuna said: How, O Madhusudana, shall I strike Bhishma and Drona withweapons in battle, they who are worthy of worship?5. Better to live in this world even on alms than to slay these high-souledGurus. Slaying these Gurus, I should taste of blood-stained enjoyments even inthis world.6. Nor do I know which for us is better, that we should conquer them or theyconquer us, – before us stand the Dhritarashtrians, whom having slain we shouldnot care to live.7. It is poorness of spirit that has smitten away from me my (true heroic)nature, my whole consciousness is bewildered in its view of right and wrong. Iask thee which may be the better – that tell me decisively. I take refuge as adisciple with thee, enlighten me.8. I see not what shall thrust from me the sorrow that dries up the senses, evenif I should attain rich and unrivalled kingdom on earth or even the sovereigntyof the gods.9. Sanjaya said: Gudakesha, terror of his foes, having thus spoken toHrishikesha, and said to him, \"I will not fight!\" became silent.10. To him thus depressed and discouraged, Hrishikesha, smiling as it were, OBharata, spoke these words between the two armies.11. The Blessed Lord said: Thou grievest for those that should not be grievedfor. yet speakest words of wisdom. The enlightened man does not mourn either forthe living or for the dead.12. It is not true that at any time I was not, nor thou, nor these kings of men;nor is it true that any of us shall ever cease to be hereafter.13. As the soul passes physically through childhood and youth and age, so itpasses on to the changing of the body. The self-composed man does not allowhimself to be disturbed and blinded by this.14. The material touches, O son of Kunti, giving cold and heat, pleasure andpain, things transient which come and go, these learn to endure, O Bharata.15. The man whom these do not trouble nor pain O lion-hearted among men, thefirm and wise who is equal in pleasure and suffering, makes himself apt forimmortality.16. That which really is, cannot go out of existence, just as that which isnon-existent cannot come into being. The end of this opposition of 'is' and 'isnot' has been perceived by the seers of essential truths.17. Know that to be imperishable by which all this is extended. Who can slay theimmortal spirit?18. Finite bodies have an end, but that which possesses and uses the body isinfinite, illimitable, eternal, indestructible. Therefore fight, O Bharata.19. He who regards this (the soul) as a slayer, and he who thinks it is slain,both of them fail to perceive the truth. It does not slay, nor is it slain.20. This is not born, nor does it die, nor is it a thing that comes into beingonce and passing away will never come into being again. It is unborn, ancient,sempiternal; it is not slain with the slaying of the body.21. Who knows it as immortal eternal imperishable spiritual existence, how canthat man slay, O Partha, or cause to be slain?22. The embodied soul casts away old and takes up new bodies as a man changesworn-out raiment for new.23. Weapons cannot cleave it, nor the fire burn, nor do the waters drench it,nor the wind dry.24. It is uncleavable, it is incombustible, it can neither be drenched nordried. Eternally stable, immobile, all-pervading, it is for ever and for ever.25. It is unmanifest, it is unthinkable, it is immutable, so it is described (bythe Srutis); therefore knowing it as such, thou shouldst not grieve.26. Even if thou thinkest of it (the self) as being constantly subject to birthand death, still, O mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve.27. For certain is death for the born, and certain is birth for the dead,therefore what is inevitable ought not to be a cause of thy sorrow.28. Beings are unmanifest in the beginning, manifest in the middle, O Bharata,unmanifest likewise are they in disintegration. What is there to be grieved at?29. One sees it as a mystery or one speaks of it or hears of it as a mystery,but none knows it. That (the Self, the One, the Divine) we look on and speak andhear of as the wonderful beyond our comprehension, for after all our learningfrom those who have knowledge, no human mind has ever known this Absolute.30. This dweller in the body of everyone is eternal and indestructible. OBharata: therefore thou shouldst not grieve for any creature.31. Further, looking to thine own law of action thou shouldst not tremble; thereis no greater good for the Kshatriya than righteous battle.32. When such a battle comes to them of itself like the open gate of heaven,happy are the Kshatriyas then.33. But if thou dost not this battle for the right, then hast thou abandoned thyduty and virtue and thy glory, and sin shall be thy portion.34. Besides, men will recount thy perpetual disgrace, and to one in noblestation, dishonour is worse than death.35. The mighty men will think thee fled from the battle through fear, and thou,that wast highly esteemed by them, will allow a smirch to fall on thy honour.36. Many unseemly words will bespoken by thy enemies, slandering thy strength;what is worse grief than that?37. Slain thou shalt win Heaven, victorious thou shalt enjoy the earth;therefore arise, O son of Kunti, resolved upon battle.38. Make grief and happiness, loss and gain, victory and defeat equal to thysoul and then turn to battle; so thou shalt not incur sin.39. Such is the intelligence (the intelligent knowledge of things and will)declared to thee in the Sankhya, hear now this in the Yoga, for if thou art inYoga by this intelligence, O son of Pritha, thou shalt cast away the bondage ofworks.40. On this path no effort is lost, no obstacle prevails; even a little of thisdharma delivers from the great fear.41. The fixed and resolute intelligence is one and homogeneous, O joy of theKurus; many-branching and multifarious is the intelligence of the irresolute.42-43. This flowery word which they declare who have not clear discernment,devoted to the creed of the Veda, whose creed is that there is nothing else,souls of desire, seekers of Paradise, – it gives the fruits of the works ofbirth, it is multifarious with specialities of rites, it is directed toenjoyment and lordship as its goal.44. The intelligence of those who are misled by that (flowery word), and clingto enjoyment and lordship, is not established in the self with concentratedfixity.45. The action of the three gunas is the subject-matter of the Veda; but do thoubecome free from the triple guna, O Arjuna; without the dualities, ever based inthe true being, without getting or having, possessed of the self.46. As much use as there is in a well with water in flood on every side, so muchis there in all the Vedas for the Brahmin who has the knowledge.47. Thou hast a right to action, but only to action, never to its fruits; letnot the fruits of thy works be thy motive, neither let there be in thee anyattachment to inactivity.48. Fixed in Yoga do thy actions, having abandoned attachment, having becomeequal in failure and success; for it is equality that is meant by Yoga.49. Works are far inferior to Yoga of the intelligence, O Dhananjaya; desirerather refuge in the intelligence; poor and wretched souls are they who make thefruit of their works the object of their thoughts and activities.50. One whose intelligence has attained to unity, casts away – even here in thisworld of dualities – both good doing and evil doing. Therefore strive to be inYoga; Yoga is skill in works.51. The sages who have united their reason and will with the Divine renounce thefruit which action yields and, liberated from the bondage of birth, they reachthe status beyond misery.52. When thy intelligence shall cross beyond the whirl of delusion, then shaltthou become indifferent to Scripture heard or that which thou hast yet to hear.53. When thy intelligence which is bewildered by the Sruti, shall stand unmovingand stable in Samadhi, then shalt thou attain to Yoga.54. Arjuna said: What is the sign of the man in Samadhi whose intelligence isfirmly fixed in wisdom? How does the sage of settled understanding speak, howsit, how walk?55. The Blessed Lord said: When a man expels, O Partha, all desires from themind, and is satisfied in the self by the self, then is he called stable inintelligence.56. He whose mind is undisturbed in the midst of sorrows and amid pleasures isfree from desire, from whom liking and fear and wrath have passed away, is thesage of settled understanding.57. Who in all things is without affection though visited by this good or thatevil and neither hates nor rejoices, his intelligence sits firmly founded inwisdom.58. Who draws away the senses from the objects of sense, as the tortoise drawsin his limbs into the shell, his intelligence sits firmly founded in wisdom.59. If one abstains from food, the objects of sense cease to affect, but theaffection itself of the sense, the rasa, remains; the rasa also ceases when theSupreme is seen.60. Even the mind of the wise man who labours for perfection is carried away bythe vehement insistence of the senses, O son of Kunti.61. Having brought all the senses under control, he must sit firm in Yoga,wholly given up to Me; for whose senses are mastered, of him the intelligence isfirmly established (in its proper seat).62. In him whose mind dwells on the objects of sense with absorbing interest,attachment to them is formed; from attachment arises desire; from desire angercomes forth.63. Anger leads to bewilderment, from bewilderment comes loss of memory; and bythat the intelligence is destroyed; from destruction of intelligence heperishes.64-65. It is by ranging over the objects with the senses, but with sensessubject to the self, freed from liking and disliking, that one gets into a largeand sweet clearness of soul and temperament in which passion and grief find noplace; the intelligence of such a man is rapidly established (in its properseat).66. For one who is not in Yoga, there is no intelligence, no concentration ofthought; for him without concentration there is no peace, and for the unpeacefulhow can there be happiness?67. Such of the roving senses as the mind follows, that carries away theunderstanding, just as the winds carry away a ship on the sea.68. Therefore, O mighty-armed, one who has utterly restrained the excitement ofthe senses by their objects, his intelligence sits firmly founded in calmself-knowledge.69. That (higher being) which is to all creatures a night, is to theself-mastering sage his waking (his luminous day of true being, knowledge andpower); the life of the dualities which is to them their waking (their day,their consciousness, their bright condition of activity) is a night (a troubledsleep and darkness of the soul) to the sage who sees.70. He attains peace, into whom all desires enter as waters into the sea (anocean of wide being and consciousness) which is ever being filled, yet evermotionless – not he who (like troubled and muddy waters) is disturbed by everylittle inrush of desire.71. Who abandons all desires and lives and acts free from longing, who has no\"I\" or \"mine\" (who has extinguished his individual ego in the One and lives inthat unity), he attains to the great peace.72. This is brahmi sthiti (firm standing in the Brahman), O son of Pritha.Having attained thereto one is not bewildered; fixed in that status at his end,one can attain to extinction in the Brahman."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIIKARMAYOGA(3. THE YOGA OF THE WORKS)1. Arjuna said: If thou boldest the intelligence to be greater than works, OJanardana, why then dost thou, O Keshava, appoint me to a terrible work?2. Thou seemest to bewilder my intelligence with a confused and mingled speech;tell me then decisively that one thing by which I may attain to my soul's weal.3. The Blessed Lord said: In this world twofold is the self-application of thesoul (by which it enters into the Brahmic condition), as I before said, Osinless one: that of the Sankhyas by the Yoga of knowledge, that of the Yoginsby the Yoga of works.4. Not by abstention from works does a man enjoy actionlessness, nor by mererenunciation (of works) does he attain to his perfection (to siddhi, theaccomplishment of the aims of his self-discipline by Yoga).5. For none stands even for a moment not doing work, everyone is made to doaction helplessly by the modes born of Prakriti.6. Who controls the organs of action, but continues in his mind to remember anddwell upon the objects of sense, such a man has bewildered himself with falsenotions of self-discipline.7. He who controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, without attachmentengages with the organs of action in Yoga of action, he excels.8. Do thou do controlled action. For action is greater than inaction; even themaintenance of thy physical life cannot be effected without action.9. By doing works otherwise than for sacrifice, this world of men is in bondageto works; for sacrifice practise works, O son of Kunti, becoming free from allattachment.10. With sacrifice the Lord of creatures of old created creatures and said: Bythis shall you bring forth (fruits or offspring), let this be your milker ofdesires.11. Foster by this the gods and let the gods foster you; fostering each other,you shall attain to the supreme good.12. Fostered by sacrifice the gods shall give you desired enjoyments: who enjoystheir given enjoyments and has not given to them, he is a thief.13. The good who eat what is left from the sacrifice, are released from all sin;but evil are they and enjoy sin who cook (the food) for their own sake.14-15. From food creatures come into being, from rain is the birth of food, fromsacrifice comes into being the rain, sacrifice is born of work; work know to beborn of Brahman, Brahman is born of the Immutable; therefore is theall-pervading Brahman established in the sacrifice.16. He who follows not here the wheel thus set in movement, evil is his being,sensual is his delight, in vain, O Partha, that man lives.17. But the man whose delight is in the Self and who is satisfied with theenjoyment of the Self and in the Self he is content, for him there exists nowork that needs to be done.18. He has no object here to be gained by action done and none to be gained byaction undone; he has no dependence on all these existences for any object to begained.19. Therefore without attachment perform ever the work that is to be done (donefor the sake of the world, lokasangraha, as is made clear immediatelyafterward); for by doing work without attachment man attains to the highest.20. It was even by works that Janaka and the rest attained to perfection. Thoushouldst do works regarding also the holding together of the peoples.21. Whatsoever the Best doeth, that the lower kind of man puts into practice;the standard he creates, the people follow.22. O Son of Pritha, I have no work that I need to do in all the three worlds, Ihave nothing that I have not gained and have yet to gain, and I abide verily inthe paths of action (varta eva cha karmani, – eva implying, I abide in it and donot leave it as the sannyasin thinks himself bound to abandon works).23-24. For if I did not abide sleeplessly in the paths of action, men follow inevery way my path, these peoples would sink to destruction if I did not work andI should be the creator of confusion and slay these creatures.25. As those who know not act with attachment to the action, he who knows shouldact without attachment, having for his motive to hold together the peoples.26. He should not create a division of their understanding in the ignorant whoare attached to their works, he should set them to all actions, doing themhimself with knowledge and in Yoga.27. While the actions are being entirely done by the modes of Nature, he whoseself is bewildered by egoism thinks that it is his \"I\" which is doing them.28. But one, O mighty-armed, who knows the true principles of the divisions ofthe modes and of works, realises that it is the modes which are acting andreacting on each other and is not caught in them by attachment.29. Those who are bewildered by the modes, not knowers of the whole, let not theknower of the whole disturb in their mental standpoint.30. Giving up thy works to Me, with thy consciousness founded in the Self, freefrom desire and egoism, fight delivered from the fever of thy soul.31-32. Who, having faith and not trusting to the critical intelligence,constantly follow this teaching of mine, they too are released from (the bondageof) works. But those who find fault with my teaching and act not thereon, knowthem to be of unripe mind, bewildered in all knowledge and fated to bedestroyed.33. All existences follow their nature and what shall coercing it avail? Eventhe man of knowledge acts according to his own nature.34. In the object of this or that sense, liking and disliking are set in ambush;fall not into their power, for they are the besetters of the soul in its path.35. Better is one's own law of works, swadharma, though in itself faulty than analien law well wrought out; death in one's own law of being is better, perilousis it to follow an alien law.36. Arjuna said: But (if there is no fault in following our Nature) what is thisin us that drives a man to sin, as if by force, even against his own strugglingwill, O Varshneya?37. The Lord said: This is desire and its companion wrath, children of rajas,all-devouring, all-polluting, know thou this as the soul's great enemy (whichhas to be slain).38. As a fire is covered over by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo iswrapped by the amnion, so this (knowledge) is enveloped by it.39. Enveloped is knowledge, O Kaunteya, by this eternal enemy of knowledge inthe form of desire which is an insatiable fire.40. The senses, mind and intellect are its seat; enveloping knowledge by theseit bewilders the embodied soul.41. Therefore, O Best of the Bharatas, controlling first the senses, do thouslay this thing of sin destructive of knowledge (in order to live in the calm,clear, luminous truth of the Spirit).42. Supreme, they say, (beyond their objects) are the senses, supreme over thesenses the mind, supreme over the mind the intelligent will: that which issupreme over the intelligent will, is he (the Purusha).43. Thus awakening by the understandings to the Highest which is beyond even thediscerning mind, putting force on the self by the self to make it firm andstill, slay thou, O mighty-armed, this enemy in the form of desire, who is sohard to assail."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IVTOWARDS THE YOGA OF KNOWLEDGE(4. THE YOGA OF KNOWLEDGE)1. The Blessed Lord said: This imperishable Yoga I gave to Vivasvan (theSun-God), Vivasvan gave it to Manu (the father of men), Manu gave it to Ikshvaku(head of the Solar line).2. And so it came down from royal sage to royal sage till it was lost in thegreat lapse of Time, O Parantapa.3. This same ancient and original Yoga has been today declared to thee by Me,for thou art My devotee and My friend; this is the highest secret.4. Arjuna said: The Sun-God was one of the firstborn of beings (ancestor of thesolar dynasty) and Thou art only now born into the world; how am I to comprehendthat Thou declaredst it to him in the beginning?5. The Blessed Lord said: Many are my lives that are past, and thine also, OArjuna; all of them I know, but thou knowest not, O scourge of the foe.6. Though I am the unborn, though I am imperishable in my self-existence, thoughI am the Lord of all existences, yet I stand upon my own Nature and I come intobirth by my self-Maya.7. Whensoever there is the fading of the Dharma and the uprising ofunrighteousness, then I loose myself forth into birth.8. For the deliverance of the good, for the destruction of the evil-doers, forthe enthroning of the Right, I am born from age to age.9. He who knoweth thus in its right principles my divine birth and my divinework, when he abandons his body, comes not to rebirth, he comes to Me, O Arjuna.10. Delivered from liking and fear and wrath, full of me, taking refuge in me,many purified by austerity of knowledge have arrived at my nature of being(madbhavam, the divine nature of the Purushottama).11. As men approach Me, so I accept them to My love (bhajami); men follow inevery way my path, O son of Pritha.12. They who desire the fulfilment of their works on earth sacrifice to the gods(various forms and personalities of the one Godhead); because the fulfilmentthat is born of works (of works without knowledge) is very swift and easy in thehuman world.13. The fourfold order was created by Me according to the divisions of qualityand active function. Know Me for the doer of this (the fourfold law of humanworkings) who am yet the imperishable non-doer.14. Works fix not themselves on Me, nor have I desire for the fruits of action;he who thus knoweth Me is not bound by works.15. So knowing was work done by the men of old who sought liberation; dotherefore, thou also, work of that more ancient kind done by the ancients.16. What is action and what is inaction, as to this even the sages are perplexedand deluded. I will declare to thee that action by the knowledge of which thoushalt be released from all ills.17. One has to understand about action as well as to understand about wrongaction and about inaction one has to understand; thick and tangled is the way ofworks.18. He who in action can see inaction and can see action still continuing incessation from works, is the man of true reason and discernment among men; he isin Yoga and a many-sided universal worker (for the good of the world, for God inthe world).19. Whose inceptions and undertakings are all free from the will of desire,whose works are burned up by the fire of knowledge, him the wise have called asage.20. Having abandoned all attachment to the fruits of his works, ever satisfiedwithout any kind of dependence, he does nothing though (through his nature) heengages in action.21. He has no personal hopes, does not seize on things as his personalpossessions; his heart and self are under perfect control; performing action bythe body alone, he does not commit sin.22. He who is satisfied with whatever gain comes to him, who has passed beyondthe dualities, is jealous of none, is equal in failure and success, he is notbound even when he acts.23. When a man liberated, free from attachment, with his mind, heart and spiritfirmly founded in self-knowledge, does works as sacrifice, all his work isdissolved.24. Brahman is the giving, Brahman is the food-offering, by Brahman it isoffered into the Brahman fire, Brahman is that which is to be attained bysamadhi in Brahman-action.25. Some Yogins follow after the sacrifice which is of the gods; others offerthe sacrifice by the sacrifice itself into the Brahman-fire.26. Some offer hearing and the other senses into the fires of control, othersoffer sound and the other objects of sense into the fires of sense.27. And others offer all the actions of the sense and all the actions of thevital force into the fire of the Yoga of self-control kindled by knowledge.28. The offering of the striver after perfection may be material and physical(dravyayajna, like that consecrated in worship by the devotee to his deity), orit may be the austerity of his self-discipline and energy of his soul directedto some high aim, tapo-yajna, or it may be some form of Yoga (like the Pranayamaof the Raja-yogins and Hatha-yogins, or any other yoga-yajna), or it may be theoffering of reading and knowledge.29. Others again who are devoted to controlling the breath, having restrainedthe Prana (the incoming breath) and Apana (the outgoing breath) pour assacrifice Prana into Apana and Apana into Prana.30. Others having regulated the food pour as sacrifice their life breaths intolife-breaths. All these are knowers of sacrifice and by sacrifice have destroyedtheir sins.31. They who enjoy the nectar of immortality left over from the sacrifice attainto the eternal Brahman; this world is not for him who doeth not sacrifice, howthen any other world?32.Therefore all these and many other forms of sacrifice have been extended inthe mouth of the Brahman (the mouth of that Fire which receives all offerings).Know thou that all these are born of work and so knowing thou shalt be free.33. The sacrifice of knowledge, O Parantapa, is greater than any materialsacrifice. Knowledge is that in which all this action culminates (not any lowerknowledge, but the highest self-knowledge and God-knowledge), O Partha!34. Learn that by worshipping the feet of the teacher, by questioning and byservice; the men of knowledge who have seen (not those who know merely by theintellect) the true principles of things, will instruct thee in knowledge.35. Possessing that knowledge thou shalt not fall again into the mind'signorance, O Pandava; for by this, thou shalt see all existences withoutexception in the Self, then in Me.36. Even if thou art the greatest doer of sin beyond all sinners, thou shaltcross over all the crookedness of evil in the ship of knowledge.37. As a fire kindled turns to ashes its fuel, O Arjuna, so the fire ofknowledge turns all works to ashes.38. There is nothing in the world equal in purity to knowledge, the man who isperfected by Yoga, finds it of himself in the self by the course of Time.39. Who has faith, who has conquered and controlled the mind and senses, who hasfixed his whole conscious being on the supreme Reality, he attains knowledge;and having attained knowledge he goes swiftly to the supreme Peace.40. The ignorant who has not faith, the soul of doubt, goeth to perdition;neither this world, nor the supreme world nor any happiness is for the soul fullof doubts.41. He who has destroyed all doubt by knowledge and has by Yoga given up allworks and is in possession of the Self is not bound by his works, O Dhananjaya.42. Therefore arise, O Bharata, and resort constantly to Yoga, having cut awaywith the sword of knowledge this perplexity born of ignorance."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VTHE YOGA OF RENUNCIATION(5. THE YOGA OF THE RENUNCIATION OF ACTION)1. Arjuna said: Thou declarest to me the renunciation of works, O Krishna, andagain thou declarest to me Yoga; which one of these is the better way, that tellme with a clear decisiveness.2. The Blessed Lord said: Renunciation and Yoga of works both bring about thesoul's salvation, but of the two the Yoga of works is distinguished above therenunciation of works.3. He should be known as always a Sannyasin (even when he is doing action) whoneither dislikes nor desires; for free from the dualities he is released easilyand happily from the bondage.4. Children speak of Sankhya and Yoga apart from each other, not the wise; if aman applies himself integrally to one, he gets the fruit of both.5. The status which is attained by the Sankhya, to that the men of the Yoga alsoarrive; who sees Sankhya and Yoga as one, he sees.6. But renunciation, O mighty-armed, is difficult to attain without Yoga; thesage who has Yoga attains soon to the Brahman.7. He who is in Yoga, the pure soul, master of his self, who has conquered thesenses, whose self becomes the self of all existences (of all things that havebecome), even though he does works, he is not involved in them.8-9. The man who knows the principles of things thinks, his mind in Yoga (withthe inactive Impersonal), \"I am doing nothing\"; when he sees, hears, tastes,smells, eats, moves, sleeps, breathes, speaks, takes, ejects, opens his eyes orcloses them, he holds that it is only the senses acting upon the objects of thesenses.10. He who, having abandoned attachment, acts reposing (or founding) his workson the Brahman, is not stained by sin even as water clings not to thelotus-leaf.11. Therefore the Yogins do works with the body, mind, understanding, or evenmerely with the organs of action, abandoning attachment, for self-purification.12. By abandoning attachment to the fruits of works, the soul in union withBrahman attains to peace of rapt foundation in Brahman, but the soul not inunion is attached to the fruit and bound by the action of desire.13. The embodied soul perfectly controlling its nature, having renounced all itsactions by the mind (inwardly, not outwardly), sits serenely in its nine-gatedcity neither doing nor causing to be done.14. The Lord neither creates the works of the world nor the state of the doernor the joining of the works to the fruit; nature works out these things.15. The all-pervading Impersonal accepts neither the sin nor the virtue of any,knowledge is enveloped by ignorance; thereby creatures are bewildered.16. Verily, in whom ignorance is destroyed by self-knowledge, in them knowledgelights up like a sun the supreme Self (within them).17. Turning their discerning mind to That, directing their whole conscious beingto That, making That their whole aim and the sole object of their devotion, theygo whence there is no return, their sins washed by the waters of knowledge.18. Sages see with an equal eye the learned and cultured Brahmin, the cow, theelephant, the dog, the outcaste.19. Even here on earth they have conquered the creation whose mind isestablished in equality; the equal Brahman is faultless, therefore they live inthe Brahman.20. With intelligence stable, unbewildered, the knower of Brahman, living in theBrahman, neither rejoices on obtaining what is pleasant, nor sorrows onobtaining what is unpleasant.21. When the soul is no longer attached to the touches of outward things, thenone finds the happiness that exists in the Self; such a one enjoys animperishable happiness, because his self is in Yoga, yukta, by Yoga with theBrahman.22. The enjoyments born of the touches of things are causes of sorrow, they havea beginning and an end; therefore the sage, the man of awakened understanding,budhah, does not place his delight in these.23. He who can bear here in the body the velocity of wrath and desire, is theYogin, the happy man.24. He who has the inner happiness and the inner ease and repose and the innerlight, that Yogin becomes the Brahman and reaches self-extinction in theBrahman, brahmanirvanam.25. Sages win Nirvana in the Brahman, they in whom the stains of sin are effacedand the knot of doubt is cut asunder, masters of their selves, who are occupiedin doing good to all creatures.26. Yatis (those who practise self-mastery by Yoga and austerity) who aredelivered from desire and wrath and have gained self-mastery, for them Nirvanain the Brahman exists all about them, encompasses them, they already live in itbecause they have knowledge of the Self.27-28. Having put outside of himself all outward touches and concentrated thevision between the eyebrows and made equal the prana and the apana moving withinthe nostrils, having controlled the senses, the mind and the understanding, thesage devoted to liberation, from whom desire and wrath and fear have passedaway, is ever free.29. When a man has known Me as the Enjoyer of sacrifice of all the worlds, thefriend of all creatures, he comes by the peace."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VITHE YOGA OF THE SUPREME SPIRIT(6. THE YOGA OF SELF-SUBDUAL)1. The Blessed Lord said: Whoever does the work to be done without resort to itsfruits, he is the Sannyasin and the Yogin, not the man who lights not thesacrificial fire and does not the works.2. What they have called renunciation (Sannyasa), know to be in truth Yoga, OPandava; for none becomes a Yogin who has not renounced the desire-will in themind.3. For a sage who is ascending the hill of Yoga, action is the cause; for thesame sage when he has got to the top of Yoga self-mastery is the cause.4. When one does not get attached to the objects of sense or to works and hasrenounced all will of desire in the mind. then is he said to have ascended tothe top of Yoga.5. By the self thou shouldst deliver the self, thou shouldst not depress andcast down the self (whether by self-indulgence or suppression); for the self isthe friend of the self and the self is the enemy.6. To the man is his self a friend in whom the (lower) self has been conqueredby the (higher) self, but to him who is not in possession of his (higher) self,the (lower) self is as if an enemy and it acts as an enemy.7. When one has conquered one's self and attained to the calm of a perfectself-mastery and self-possession, then is the supreme self in a man founded andpoised (even in his outwardly conscious human being) in cold and heat, pleasureand pain as well as in honour and dishonour.8. The Yogin, who is satisfied with self-knowledge, tranquil and self-poised,master of his senses, regarding alike clod and stone and gold, is said to be inYoga.9. He who is equal in soul to friend and enemy and to neutral and indifferent,also to sinner and saint, he excels.10. Let the Yogin practise continually union with the Self (so that that maybecome his normal consciousness) sitting apart and alone, with all desire andidea of possession banished from his mind, self-controlled in his whole beingand consciousness.11-12. He should set in a pure spot his firm seat, neither too high, nor yet toolow, covered with a cloth, with a deer skin, with sacred grass, and there seatedwith a concentrated mind and with the workings of the mental consciousness andthe senses under control, he should practise Yoga for self-purification.13-14. Holding the body, head and neck erect, motionless (the posture proper tothe practice of Rajayoga), the vision drawn in and fixed between the eyebrows,not regarding the regions, the mind kept calm and free from fear and the vow ofBrahmacharya observed, the whole controlled mentality turned to Me (the Divine),he must sit firm in Yoga, wholly given up to Me (so that the lower action of theconsciousness shall be merged in the higher peace).15. Thus always putting himself in Yoga by control of his mind, the Yoginattains to the supreme peace of Nirvana which has its foundation in Me.16. Verily this Yoga is not for him who eats too much or sleeps too much, evenas it is not for him who gives up sleep and food, O Arjuna.17. Yoga destroys all sorrow for him in whom the sleep and waking, the food, theplay, the putting forth of effort in works are all yukta.18. When all the mental consciousness is perfectly controlled and liberated fromdesire and remains still in the self, then it is said, \"he is in Yoga.\"19. Motionless like the light of a lamp in a windless place is the controlledconsciousness (free from its restless action, shut in from its outward motion)of the Yogin who practises union with the Self.20. That in which the mind becomes silent and still by the practice of Yoga:that in which the Self is seen within in the Self by the Self (seen, not as itis mistranslated falsely or partially by the mind and represented to us throughthe ego, but self-perceived by the Self, swaprakasha), and the soul issatisfied.21. That in which the soul knows its own true and exceeding bliss, which isperceived by the intelligence and is beyond the senses, wherein established, itcan no longer fall away from the spiritual truth of its being.22. That is the greatest of all gains and the treasure beside which all losetheir value, wherein established he is not disturbed by the fieriest assault ofmental grief.23. It is the putting away of the contact with pain, the divorce of the mind'smarriage with grief. The firm winning of this inalienable spiritual bliss isYoga; it is the divine union. This Yoga is to be resolutely practised withoutyielding to any discouragement by difficulty or failure (until the release,until the bliss of Nirvana is secured as an eternal possession).24-25. Abandoning without any exception or residue all the desires born of thedesire-will and holding the senses by the mind so that they shall not run to allsides (after their usual disorderly and restless habit), one should slowly ceasefrom mental action by a buddhi held in the grasp of fixity, and having fixed themind in the higher Self one should not think of anything at all.26. Whenever the restless and unquiet mind goes forth, it should be controlledand brought into subjection in the Self.27. When the mind is thoroughly quieted, then there comes upon the Yoginstainless, passionless, the highest bliss of the soul that has become theBrahman.28. Thus freed from stain of passion and putting himself constantly into Yoga,the Yogin easily and happily enjoys the touch of the Brahman which is anexceeding bliss.29. The man whose self is in Yoga, sees the self in all beings and all beings inthe self, he is equal-visioned everywhere.30. He who sees Me everywhere and sees all in Me, to him I do not get lost, nordoes he get lost to Me.31. The Yogin who has taken his stand upon oneness and loves Me in all beings,however and in all ways he lives and acts, lives and acts in Me.32. He, O Arjuna, who sees with equality everything in the image of the selfwhether it be grief or it be happiness, him I hold to be the supreme Yogin.33. Arjuna said: This Yoga of the nature of equality which has been described byThee, O Madhusudana, I see no stable foundation for it, owing to restlessness.34. Restless indeed is the mind, O Krishna; it is vehement, strong andunconquerable; I deem it as hard to control as the wind.35. The Blessed Lord said: Without doubt, O mighty-armed, the mind is restlessand very difficult to restrain; but, O Kaunteya, it may be controlled byconstant practice and non-attachment.36. By one who is not self-controlled, this Yoga is difficult to attain; but bythe self-controlled, it is attainable by properly directed efforts.37. Arjuna said: He who takes up Yoga with faith, but cannot control himselfwith the mind wandering away from Yoga, failing to attain perfection in Yoga,what is his end, O Krishna?38. Does he not, O mighty-armed, lose both this life (of human activity andthought and emotion which it has left behind) and the Brahmic consciousness towhich it aspires and falling from both perish like a dissolving cloud?39. This my doubt, O Krishna, please dispel completely without leaving anyresidue; for there is none else than Thyself who can destroy this doubt.40. The Blessed Lord said: O son of Pritha, neither in this life nor hereafteris there destruction for him; never does anyone who practises good, O beloved,come to woe.41. Having attained to the world of the righteous and having dwelt there forimmemorial years, he who fell from Yoga is again born in the house of such asare pure and glorious.42. Or he may be born in the family of the wise Yogin; indeed such a birth israre to obtain in this world.43. There he recovers the mental state of union (with the Divine) which he hadformed in his previous life: and with this he again endeavours for perfection, Ojoy of the Kurus.44. By that former practice he is irresistibly carried on. Even the seeker afterthe knowledge of Yoga goes beyond the range of the Vedas and Upanishads.45. But the Yogin, endeavouring with assiduity, purified from sin, perfectinghimself through many lives attains to the highest goal.46. The Yogin is greater than the doers of askesis, greater than the men ofknowledge, greater than the men of works; become then the Yogin, O Arjuna.47. Of all Yogins he who with all his inner self given up to me, for me has loveand faith, him I hold to be the most united with me in Yoga."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIITHE YOGA OF KNOWLEDGE(7. THE YOGA OF ESSENTIAL AND COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE)1. The Blessed Lord said: Hear, O Partha, how by practising Yoga with a mindattached to me and with me as ashraya (the whole basis, lodgement, point ofresort of the conscious being and action) thou shalt know me without anyremainder of doubt, integrally.2. I will speak to thee without omission or remainder the essential knowledge,attended with all the comprehensive knowledge, by knowing which there shall beno other thing here left to be known.3. Among thousands of men one here and there strives after perfection, and ofthose who strive and attain to perfection one here and there knows me in all theprinciples of my existence.4. The five elements (conditions of material being), mind (with its varioussenses and organs), reason, ego, this is my eightfold divided Nature.5. This the lower. But know my other Nature different from this, O mighty-armed,the supreme which becomes the Jiva and by which this world is upheld.6. Know this to be the womb of all beings. I am the birth of the whole world andso too its dissolution.7. There is nothing else supreme beyond Me, O Dhananjaya. On Me all that is hereis strung like pearls upon a thread.8. I am taste in the waters, O son of Kunti, I am the light of sun and moon, Iam pranava (the syllable OM) in all the Vedas, sound in ether and manhood inmen.9. I am pure scent in earth and energy of light in fire; I am life in allexistences, I am the ascetic force of those who do askesis.10. Know me to be the eternal seed of all existences, O son of Pritha. I am theintelligence of the intelligent, the energy of the energetic.11. I am the strength of the strong devoid of desire and liking. I am in beingsthe desire which is not contrary to dharma, O Lord of the Bharatas.12. And as for the secondary subjective becomings of Nature, bhavah (states ofmind, affections of desire, movements of passion, the reactions of the senses,the limited and dual play of reason, the turns of the feeling and moral sense),which are sattwic, rajasic and tamasic, they are verily from me, but I am not inthem, it is they that are in me.13. By these three kinds of becoming which are of the nature of the gunas, thiswhole world is bewildered and does not recognise Me supreme beyond them andimperishable.14. This is my divine Maya of the gunas and it is hard to overcome; those crossbeyond it who approach Me.15. The evil-doers attain not to Me, souls bewildered, low in the human scale;for their knowledge is left away from them by Maya and they resort to the natureof being of the Asura.16. Among the virtuous ones who turn towards Me (the Divine) with devotion, OArjuna, there are four kinds of bhaktas, the suffering, the seeker for good inthe world, the seeker for knowledge, and those who adore Me with knowledge, OLord of the Bharatas.17. Of those the knower, who is ever in constant union with the Divine, whosebhakti is all concentrated on Him, is the best, he loves Me perfectly and is Mybeloved.18. Noble are all these without exception, but the knower is verily my self: foras his highest goal he accepts Me, the Purushottama with whom he is in union.19. At the end of many births the man of knowledge attains to Me. Very rare isthe great soul who knows that Vasudeva, the omnipresent Being, is all that is.20. Men are led away by various outer desires which take from them the workingof the inner knowledge, they resort to other godheads and they set up this orthat rule, which satisfies the need of their nature.21. Whatever form of Me any devotee with faith desires to worship, I make thatfaith of his firm and undeviating.22. He endowed with that faith worships that form; and when by the force of thatfaith in his cult and worship he gets his desires, it is I myself who (in thatform) give these fruits.23. But these fruits are temporary, sought after by those who are of pettyintelligence and unformed reason. To the gods go the worshippers of the gods,but my devotees come to Me.24. Petty minds think of Me, the unmanifest, as being limited by manifestation,because they know not my supreme nature of being, imperishable, most perfect.25. Nor am I revealed to all, enveloped in My Yoga-maya; this bewildered worldknows Me not, the unborn, the imperishable.26. I know all past and all present and future existences, O Arjuna, but Me noneyet knows.27. By the delusion of the dualities which arises from wish and disliking, OBharata, all existences in the creation are led into bewilderment.28. But those men of virtuous deeds, in whom sin is come to an end, they, freedfrom the delusion of the dualities, worship Me, steadfast in the vow ofself-consecration.29. Those who have resort to Me as their refuge, those who turn to Me in theirspiritual effort towards release from age and death (from the mortal being andits limitations), come to know that Brahman and all the integrality of thespiritual nature and the entirety of Karma.30. Because they know Me and know at the same time the material and the divinenature of being and the truth of the Master of sacrifice, they keep knowledge ofMe also in the critical moment of their departure from physical existence andhave at that moment their whole consciousness in union with Me (thePurushottama)."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIITHE IMMUTABLE BRAHMAN(8. THE YOGA OF THE IMMUTABLE BRAHMAN)1. Arjuna said: What is tad brahma, what adhyatma, what karma, O Purushottama?And what is declared to be adhibhuta, what is called adhidaiva?1. What is adhiyajna in this body, O Madhusudana? And how, in the criticalmoment of departure from physical existence, art Thou to be known by theself-controlled?3. The Blessed Lord said: The Akshara is the supreme Brahman: swabhava is calledadhyatma; Karma is the name given to the creative movement, visarga, whichbrings into existence all beings and their subjective and objective states.4. Adhibhuta is ksharobhava, adhidaiva is the Purusha; I myself am the Lord ofsacrifice, adhiyajna here in the body, O best of embodied beings.5. Whoever leaves his body and departs remembering Me at his time of end, comesto my bhava (that of the Purushottama, my status of being); there is no doubt ofthat.6. Whosoever at the end abandons the body, thinking upon any form of being, tothat form he attains, O Kaunteya, into which the soul was at each moment growinginwardly during the physical life.7. Therefore at all times remember me and fight; for if thy mind and thyunderstanding are always fixed on and given up to Me, to Me thou shalt surelycome.8. For it is by thinking always of him with a consciousness united with him inan undeviating Yoga of constant practice that one comes to the divine andsupreme Purusha, O Partha.9-10. This supreme Self is the Seer, the Ancient of Days, subtler than thesubtle and (in his eternal self-vision and wisdom) the Master and Ruler of allexistence who sets in their place in his being all things that are; his form isunthinkable, he is refulgent as the sun beyond the darkness; he who thinkethupon this Purusha in the time of departure, with motionless mind, a soul armedwith the strength of Yoga, a union with God in bhakti and the life-forceentirely drawn up and set between the brows in the seat of mystic vision, heattains to this supreme divine Purusha.11. This supreme Soul is the immutable self-existent Brahman of whom theVeda-knowers speak, and this is that into which the doers of askesis enter whenthey have passed beyond the affections of the mind of mortality and for thedesire of which they practise the control of the bodily passions; that status Iwill declare to thee with brevity.12-13. All the doors of the senses closed, the mind shut in into the heart, thelife-force taken up out of its diffused movement into the head, the intelligenceconcentrated in the utterance of the sacred syllable OM and its conceptivethought in the remembrance of the supreme Godhead, he who goes forth, abandoningthe body, he attains to the highest status.14. He who continually remembers Me, thinking of none else, the Yogin, O Partha,who is in constant union with Me, finds Me easy to attain.15. Having come to me, these great souls come not again to birth, this transientand painful condition of our mortal being; they reach the highest perfection.16. The highest heavens of the cosmic plan are subject to a return to rebirth,but, O Kaunteya, there is no rebirth imposed on the soul that comes to Me (thePurushottama).17. Those who know the day of Brahma, a thousand ages (Yugas) in duration, andthe night, a thousand ages in ending, they are the knowers of day and night.18. At the coming of the Day all manifestations are born into being out of theunmanifest, at the coming of the Night all vanish or are dissolved into it.19. This multitude of existences helplessly comes into the becoming again andagain, is dissolved at the coming of the Night, O Partha, and is born into beingat the coming of the Day.20. But this unmanifest is not the original divinity of the Being; there isanother status of his existence, a supracosmic unmanifest beyond this cosmicnon-manifestation (which is eternally self-seated, is not an opposite of thiscosmic status of manifestation but far above and unlike it, changeless,eternal), not forced to perish with the perishing of all these existences.21. He is called the unmanifest immutable, him they speak of as the supreme souland status, and those who attain to him return not; that is my supreme place ofbeing.22. But that supreme Purusha has to be won by a bhakti which turns to him alonein whom all beings exist and by whom all this world has been extended in space.23. That time wherein departing Yogins do not return, and also that whereindeparting they return, that time shall I declare to thee, O foremost of theBharatas.24-25. Fire and light and smoke or mist, the day and the night, the brightfortnight of the lunar month and the dark, the northern solstice and thesouthern, these are the opposites. By the first in each pair the knowers of theBrahman go to the Brahman; but by the second the Yogin reaches the \"lunar light\"and returns subsequently to human birth.26. These are the bright and the dark paths (called the path of the gods and thepath of the fathers in the Upanishads); by the one he departs who does notreturn, by the other he who returns again.27. The Yogin who knows them is not misled into any error, therefore at alltimes be in Yoga, O Arjuna.28. The fruit of meritorious deeds declared in the Vedas, sacrifices,austerities and charitable gifts, the Yogin passes all these by having knownthis and attains to the supreme and sempiternal status."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IXTHE KING-KNOWLEDGE, THE KING-SECRET(9. THE YOGA OF KING-KNOWLEDGE AND KING-SECRET)1. The Blessed Lord said: What I am going to tell thee, the uncarping, is themost secret thing of all, the essential knowledge attended with all thecomprehensive knowledge, by knowing which thou shalt be released from evil.2. This is the king-knowledge, the king-secret (the wisdom of all wisdoms, thesecret of all secrets), it is a pure and supreme light which one can verify bydirect spiritual experience, it is the right and just knowledge, the very law ofbeing. It is easy to practise and imperishable.3. (But faith is necessary). The soul that fails to get faith in the highertruth and law, O Parantapa, not attaining to Me, must return into the path ofordinary mortal living (subject to death and error and evil.)4. By Me, all this universe has been extended in the ineffable mystery of Mybeing; all existences are situated in Me, not I in them.5. And yet all existences are not situated in Me, behold My divine Yoga; Myselfis that which supports all being and constitutes their existence.6. It is as the great, the all-pervading aerial principle dwells in the ethericthat all existences dwell in Me, that is how you have to conceive of it.7. All existences, O Kaunteya, return into My divine Nature (out of her actioninto her immobility and silence) in the lapse of the cycle; at the beginning ofthe cycle again I loose them forth.8. Leaning – pressing down upon my own Nature (Prakriti) I create (loose forthinto various being) all this multitude of existences, all helplessly subject tothe control of Nature.9. Nor do these works bind me, O Dhananjaya, for I am seated as if indifferentabove, unattached to those actions.10. I am the presiding control of my own action of Nature, (not a spirit born inher, but) the creative spirit who causes her to produce all that appears in themanifestation. Because of this, O Kaunteya, the world proceeds in cycles.11. Deluded minds despise me lodged in the human body because they know not mysupreme nature of being, Lord of all existences.12. All their hope, action, knowledge are vain things (when judged by the Divineand eternal standard); they dwell in the Rakshasic and Asuric nature whichdeludes the will and the intelligence.13. The great-souled, O Partha, who dwell in the divine nature know Me (theGodhead lodged in human body) as the Imperishable from whom all existencesoriginate and so knowing they turn to Me with a sole and entire love.14. Always adoring Me, steadfast in spiritual endeavour, bowing down to Me withdevotion, they worship Me ever in Yoga.15. Others also seek Me out by the sacrifice of knowledge and worship Me in Myoneness and in every separate being and in all My million universal faces(fronting them in the world and its creatures).16. I the ritual action, I the sacrifice, I the food-oblation, I the fire-givingherb, the mantra I, I also the butter, I the flame, the offering I.17. I the Father of this world, the Mother, the Ordainer, the first Creator, theobject of Knowledge, the sacred syllable OM and also the Rik, Sama and Yajur(Vedas).18. I the path and goal, the upholder, the master, the witness, the house andcountry, the refuge, the benignant friend; I the birth and status anddestruction of apparent existence, I the imperishable seed of all and theireternal resting-place.19. I give heat, I withhold and send forth the rain; immortality and also death,existent and non-existent am I, O Arjuna.20. The Knowers of the triple Veda, who drink the soma-wine, purify themselvesfrom sin, worshipping Me with sacrifice, pray of Me the way to heaven: theyascending to the heavenly worlds by their righteousness enjoy in paradise thedivine feasts of the gods.21. They, having enjoyed heavenly worlds of larger felicities, the reward oftheir good deeds exhausted, return to mortal existence. Resorting to the virtuesenjoined by the three Vedas, seeking the satisfaction of desire, they follow thecycle of birth and death.22. To those men who worship Me making Me alone the whole object of theirthought, to those constantly in Yoga with Me, I spontaneously bring every good.23. Even those who sacrifice to other godheads with devotion and faith, theyalso sacrifice to Me, O son of Kunti, though not according to the true law.24. It is I myself who am the enjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices, but theydo not know Me in the true principles and hence they fall.25. They who worship the gods go to the gods, to the (divinised) Ancestors gothe Ancestor-worshippers, to elemental spirits go those who sacrifice toelemental spirits; but My worshippers come to Me.26. He who offers to Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, a cup of water,that offering of love from the striving soul, is acceptable to Me.27. Whatever thou doest, whatever thou enjoyest, whatever thou sacrificest,whatever thou givest, whatever energy of tapasya, of the soul's will or effort,thou puttest forth, make it an offering unto Me.28. Thus shall thou be liberated from good and evil results which constitute thebonds of action; with thy soul in union with the Divine through renunciation,thou shall become free and attain to Me.29. I (the Eternal Inhabitant) am equal in all existences, none is dear to Me,none hated; yet those who turn to Me with love and devotion, they are in Me andI also in them.30. If even a man of very evil conduct turns to Me with a sole and entire love,he must be regarded as a saint, for the settled will of endeavour in him is aright and complete will.31. Swiftly he becomes a soul of righteousness and obtains eternal peace. Thisis my word of promise, O Arjuna, that he who loves me shall not perish.32. Those who takes refuge with Me, O Partha, though outcastes, born from a wombof sin, women, Vaishyas, even Shudras, they also attain to the highest goal.33. How much rather then holy Brahmins and devoted king-sages; thou who hastcome to this transient and unhappy world, love and turn to Me.34. Become my minded, my lover and adorer, a sacrificer to me, bow thyself tome, thus united with me in the Self thou shalt come to me, having me as thysupreme goal."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XGOD IN POWER OF BECOMING(10. THE YOGA OF VIBHUTI (DIVINE MANIFESTATION))1. The Blessed Lord said: Again, O mighty-armed, hearken to my supreme word,that I will speak to thee from my will for thy soul's good, now that thy heartis taking delight in me.2. Neither the gods nor the great Rishis know any birth of Me, for I amaltogether and in every way the origin of the gods and the great Rishis.3. Whosoever knows Me as the Unborn, without origin, mighty Lord of the worldsand peoples, lives unbewildered among mortals and is delivered from all sin andevil.4-5. Understanding and knowledge and freedom from the bewilderment of theIgnorance, forgiveness and truth and self-government and calm of inner control,grief and pleasure, coming into being and destruction, fear and fearlessness,glory and ingloriousness, non-injuring and equality, contentment and austerityand giving, all here in their separate diversities are subjective becomings ofexistences, and they all proceed from Me.6. The great Rishis, the seven Ancients of the world, and also the four Manus,are my mental becomings; from them are all these living creatures in the world.7. Whosoever knows in its right principles this my pervading lordship and thismy Yoga, unites himself to me by an untrembling Yoga; of this there is no doubt.8. I am the birth of everything and from Me all proceeds into development ofaction and movement; understanding thus, the wise adore Me in rapt emotion.9. Their consciousness full of Me, their life wholly given up to Me, illuminingeach other, mutually talking about Me, they are ever contented and joyful.10. To these who are thus in a constant union with Me, and adore Me with anintense delight of love, I give the Yoga of understanding by which they come toMe.11. Out of compassion for them, I, lodged in their self, lift the blazing lampof knowledge and destroy the darkness which is born of the ignorance.12. Arjuna said: Thou art the supreme Brahman, the supreme Abode, the supremePurity, the one Permanent, the divine Purusha, the original Godhead, the Unborn,the all-pervading Lord.13. All the Rishis say this of Thee and the divine seer Narada, Asita, Devala,Vyasa; and Thou Thyself sayest it to me.14. All this that Thou sayest, my mind holds for the truth, O Keshava. Neitherthe Gods nor the Titans, O blessed Lord, know Thy manifestation.15. Thou alone knowest Thyself by Thyself, O Purushottama: Source of beings,Lord of beings, God of gods, Master of the world!16. Thou shouldst tell me of Thy divine self-manifestations, all withoutexception. Thy Vibhutis by which Thou standest pervading these worlds.17. How shall I know Thee, O Yogin, by thinking of Thee everywhere at allmoments and in what pre-eminent becomings should I think of Thee, O BlessedLord?18. In detail tell me of Thy Yoga and Vibhuti, O Janardana; and tell me evermore of it; it is nectar of immortality to me, and however much of it I hear, Iam not satiated.19. The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell thee of my divine Vibhutis, but onlyin some of My principal pre-eminences, O best of the Kurus; for there is no endto the detail of My self-extension in the universe.20. I, O Gudakesha, am the Self, which abides within all beings. I am thebeginning and middle and end of all beings.21. Among the Adityas I am Vishnu; among lights and splendours I am the radiantSun; I am Marichi among the Maruts; among the stars the Moon am I.22. Among the Vedas I am the Sama-Veda; among the gods I am Vasava; I am mindamong the senses; in living beings I am consciousness.23. I am Shiva among the Rudras, the lord of wealth among the Yakshas andRakshasas, Agni among the Vasus; Meru among the peaks of the world am I.24. And know Me, O Partha, of the high priests of the world the chief,Brihaspati; I am Skanda, the war-god, leader of the leaders of battle; among theflowing waters I am the ocean.25. I am Bhrigu among the great Rishis; I am the sacred syllable OM among words;among acts of worship I am the worship called Japa (silent repetitions of sacrednames etc.); among the mountain-ranges I am Himalaya.26. I am the Ashwattha among all plants and trees; and I am Narada among thedivine sages, Chitraratha among the Gandharvas, the Muni Kapila among theSiddhas.27. Uchchaisravas among horses know me, nectar-born; Airavata among lordlyelephants; and among men the king of men.28. Among weapons I am the divine thunderbolt; I am Kamadhenu the cow of plentyamong cattle; I am Kandarpa the love-god among the progenitors; among theserpents Vasuki am I.29. And I am Ananta among the Nagas, Varuna among the peoples of the sea,Aryaman among the Fathers, Yama (lord of the Law) among those who maintain ruleand law.30. And I am Prahlada among the Titans; I am Time the head of all reckoning tothose who reckon and measure; and among the beasts of the forest I am the kingof the beasts, and Vainateya among birds.31. I am the wind among purifiers; I am Rama among warriors; and I am thealligator among fishes; among the rivers Ganges am I.32. Of creation I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna. Iam spiritual knowledge among the many philosophies, arts and sciences; I am thelogic of those who debate.33. I am the letter A among letters, the dual among compounds. I am imperishableTime; I am the Master and Ruler (of all existences), whose faces are everywhere.34. And I am all-snatching Death, and I am too the birth of all that shall comeinto being. Among feminine qualities I am glory and beauty and speech and memoryand intelligence and steadfastness and forgiveness.35. I am also the great Sama among mantras, the Gayatri among metres; among themonths I am Marga-sirsha, first of the months; I am spring, the fairest ofseasons.36. I am the gambling of the cunning, and the strength of the mighty; I amresolution and perseverance and victory; I am the sattwic quality of the good.37. I am Krishna among the Vrishnis, Arjuna among the Pandavas; I am Vyasa amongthe sages; I am Ushanas among the seer-poets.38. I am the mastery and power of all who rule and tame and vanquish and thepolicy of all who succeed and conquer; I am the silence of things secret and theknowledge of the knower.39. And whatsoever is the seed of all existences, that am I, O Arjuna; nothingmoving or unmoving, animate or inanimate in the world can be without me.40. There is no numbering or limit to My divine Vibhutis, O Parantapa; what Ihave spoken, is nothing more than a summary development and I have given onlythe light of a few leading indications.41. Whatever beautiful and glorious creature thou seest in the world, whateverbeing is mighty and forceful (among men and above man and below him), know to bea very splendour, light, and energy of Me and born of a potent portion andintense power of my existence.42. But what need is there of a multitude of details for this knowledge, OArjuna? Take it thus, that I am here in this world and everywhere. I supportthis entire universe with an infinitesimal portion of Myself."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XITHE VISION OF THE WORLD-SPIRIT(11. THE YOGA OF THE VISION OF THE WORLD-SPIRIT)1. Arjuna said: This word of the highest spiritual secret of existence. Thouhast spoken out of compassion for me; by this my delusion is dispelled.2. The birth and passing away of existences have been heard by me in detail fromThee, O Lotus-eyed, and also the imperishable greatness of the divine consciousSoul.3. So it is, as Thou hast declared Thyself, O Supreme Lord; I desire to see Thydivine form and body, O Purushottama.4. If Thou thinkest that it can be seen by me, O Lord, O Master of Yoga, thenshow me Thy imperishable Self.5. The Blessed Lord said: Behold, O Partha, my hundreds and thousands of divineforms, various in kind, various in shape and hue.6. Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Aswins and also theMaruts; behold many wonders that none has beheld, O Bharata.7. Here, to-day, behold the whole world, with all that is moving and unmoving,unified in my body, O Gudakesha, and whatever else thou wiliest to see.8. What thou hast to see, this thy human eye cannot grasp; but there is a divineeye (an inmost seeing) and that eye I now give to thee. Behold Me in My divineYoga.9-14. Sanjaya said: Having thus spoken, O King, the Master of the great Yoga.Hari, showed to Partha His supreme Form. It is that of the infinite Godheadwhose faces are everywhere and in whom are all the wonders of existence, whomultiplies unendingly all the many marvellous revelations of His being, aworld-wide Divinity seeing with innumerable eyes, speaking from innumerablemouths, armed for battle with numberless divine uplifted weapons, glorious withdivine ornaments of beauty, robed in heavenly raiment of deity, lovely withgarlands of divine flowers, fragrant with divine perfumes. Such is the light ofthis body of God as if a thousand suns had risen at once in heaven. The wholeworld multitudinously divided and yet unified is visible in the body of the Godof Gods. Arjuna sees him (God magnificent and beautiful and terrible, the Lordof souls who has manifested in the glory and greatness of his spirit this wildand monstrous and orderly and wonderful and sweet and terrible world) andovercome with marvel and joy and fear he bows down and adores with words of aweand with clasped hands the tremendous vision.15. Arjuna said: I see all the gods in Thy body, O God, and different companiesof beings, Brahma the creating Lord seated in the Lotus, and the Rishis and therace of the divine Serpents.16. I see numberless arms and bellies and eyes and faces, I see Thy infiniteforms on every side, but I see not Thy end nor Thy middle nor Thy beginning, OLord of the universe, O Form universal.17. I see Thee crowned and with Thy mace and Thy discus, hard to discern becauseThou art a luminous mass of energy on all sides of me, an encompassing blaze, asun-bright fire-bright Immeasurable.18. Thou art the supreme Immutable whom we have to know, Thou art the highfoundation and abode of the I universe, Thou art the imperishable guardian ofthe eternal laws, Thou art the sempiternal soul of existence.19. I behold Thee without end or middle or beginning, of infinite force, ofnumberless arms, Thy eyes are suns and moons, Thou hast a face of blazing fireand thou art ever burning up the whole universe with the flame of Thy energy.20. The whole space between earth and heaven is occupied by Thee alone, when isseen this Thy fierce and astounding form, the three worlds are all in pain andsuffer, O Thou mighty Spirit.21. The companies of the gods enter Thee, afraid, adoring; the Rishis and theSiddhas crying, “May there be peace and weal”, praise Thee with many praises.22. The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Vishvas, the two Aswins and the Marutsand the Ushmapas, the Gandharvas, Yakshas, Asuras, Siddhas, all have their eyesfixed on Thee in amazement.23. Seeing Thy great form of many mouths and eyes, O Mighty-armed, of many arms,thighs and feet and bellies, terrible with many teeth, the world and its nationsare shaken and in anguish, as also am I.24. I see Thee, touching heaven, blazing, of many hues, with opened mouths andenormous burning eyes, troubled and in pain is the soul within me and I find nopeace or gladness.25. As I look upon Thy mouths terrible with many tusks of destruction. Thy faceslike the fires of Death and Time, I lose sense of the directions and find nopeace. Turn Thy heart to grace, O God of gods! refuge of all the worlds!26-27. The sons of Dhritarashtra, all with the multitude of kings and heroes,Bhishma and Drona and Kama along with the foremost warriors on our side too, arehastening into Thy tusked and terrible jaws and some are seen with crushed andbleeding heads caught between Thy teeth of power.28. As is the speed of many rushing waters racing towards the ocean, so allthese heroes of the world of men are entering into Thy many mouths of flame.29. As a swarm of moths with ever-increasing speed fall to their destructioninto a fire that some one has kindled, so now the nations with ever-increasingspeed are entering into Thy jaws of doom.30. Thou lickest the regions all around with Thy tongues and Thou art swallowingup all the nations in Thy mouths of burning; all the world is filled with theblaze of Thy energies; fierce and terrible are Thy lustres and they burn us, OVishnu.31. Declare to me who Thou art that wearest this form of fierceness. Salutationto Thee, O Thou great Godhead, turn Thy heart to grace. I would know who Thouart who wast from the beginning, for I know not the will of Thy workings.32. The Blessed Lord said: I am the Time-Spirit, destroyer of the world, arisenhuge-statured for the destruction of the nations. Even without thee all thesewarriors shall be not, who are ranked in the opposing armies.33. Therefore arise, get thee glory, conquer thy enemies and enjoy an opulentkingdom. By me and none other already even are they slain, do thou become theoccasion only, O Savyasachin.34. Slay, by me who are slain, Drona, Bhishma, Jayad-ratha, Kama and otherheroic fighters; be not pained and troubled. Fight, thou shall conquer theadversary in the battle.35. Sanjaya said: Having heard these words of Keshava, Kiriti (Arjuna), withclasped hands and trembling, saluted again and spoke to Krishna in a falteringvoice very much terrified and bowing down.36. Arjuna said: Rightly and in good place, O Krishna, does the world rejoiceand take pleasure in Thy name; the Rakshasas are fleeing from Thee in terror toall the quarters and the companies of the Siddhias bow down before Thee inadoration.37. How should they not do Thee homage, O great Spirit? For Thou art theoriginal Creator and Doer of works and greater even than creative Brahma. O ThouInfinite, O Thou Lord of the gods, O Thou abode of the universe, Thou art theImmutable and Thou art what in and is not, and Thou art that which is theSupreme.38. Thou art the ancient Soul and the first and original Godhead and the supremeresting-place of this All; Thou art the knower and that which is to be known andthe highest status; O infinite in form, by Thee was extended the universe.39-40. Thou art Yama and Vayu and Agni and Soma and Varuna and Prajapati, fatherof creatures, and the great-grandsire. Salutation to Thee a thousand times overand again and yet again salutation, in front and behind and from every side, forThou art each and all that is. Infinite in might and immeasurable in strength ofaction Thou pervadest all and art everyone.41-42. For whatsoever I have spoken to Thee in rash vehemence, thinking of Theeonly as my human friend and companion, ‘O Krishna, O Yadava, O Comrade,’ notknowing this Thy greatness, in negligent error or in love, and for whatsoeverdisrespect was shown by me to Thee in jest, at play, on the couch and the seatand in the banquet, alone or in Thy presence, O faultless One, I prayforgiveness from Thee, the immeasurable.43. Thou art the father of all this world of the moving and unmoving; Thou artone to be worshipped and the most solemn object of veneration. None is equal toThee, how then another greater in all the three worlds, O incomparable in might?44. Therefore I bow down before Thee and prostrate my body and I demand grace ofThee the adorable Lord. As a father to his son, as a friend to his friend andcomrade, as one dear with him he loves, so shouldst Thou, O Godhead, bear withme.45. I have seen what never was seen before and I rejoice, but my mind istroubled with fear. O Godhead, show me that other form of Thine; turn Thy heartto grace, O Thou Lord of the gods, O Thou abode of this universe.46. I would see Thee even as before crowned and with Thy mace and discus. AssumeThy four-armed shape, O thousand-armed, O Form universal.47. The Blessed Lord said: This that thou now seest by my favour, O Arjuna, ismy supreme shape, my form of luminous energy, the universal, the infinite, theoriginal which none but thou amongst men has yet seen. I have shown it by myself-Yoga.48. Neither by the study of Vedas and sacrifices, nor by gifts or ceremonialrites or severe austerities, this form of mine can be seen by any other thanthyself, O foremost of Kurus.49. Thou shouldst envisage this tremendous vision without pain, withoutconfusion of mind, without any sinking of the members. Cast away fear and letthy heart rejoice, behold again this other form of mine.50. Sanjaya said: Vasudeva, having thus spoken to Arjuna, again manifested hisnormal (Narayana) image; the Mahatman again assuming the desired form of graceand love and sweetness consoled the terrified one.51. Arjuna said: Beholding again Thy gentle human form, O Janardana, my heart isfilled with delight and I am restored to my own nature.52-54. The Blessed Lord said: The greater Form that thou hast seen is only forthe rare highest souls. The gods themselves ever desire to look upon it. Nor canI be seen as thou hast seen Me by Veda or austerities or gifts or sacrifice, itcan be seen, known, entered into only by that bhakti which regards, adores andloves Me alone in all things.55. Вe a doer of my works, accept Me as the supreme being and object, become mybhakta, be free from attachment and without enmity to all existences: for such aman comes to Me, O Pandava."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIIBHAKTIYOGA(12. THE YOGA OF DEVOTION)1. Arjuna said: Those devotees who thus by a constant union seek after Thee, andthose who seek after the unmanifest Immutable, which of these have the greaterknowledge of Yoga?2. The Lord said: Those who found their mind in Me and by constant union,possessed of a supreme faith, seek after Me, I hold to be the most perfectly inunion of Yoga.3-4. But those who seek after the indefinable unmanifest Immutable omnipresent,unthinkable, self-poised, immobile, constant, they also by restraining all theirsenses, by the equality of their understanding and by their seeing of one selfin all things and by their tranquil benignancy of silent will for the good ofall existences, arrive to Me.5. The difficulty of those who devote themselves to the search of the unmanifestBrahman is greater; it is a thing to which embodied souls can only arrive by aconstant mortification, a suffering of all the repressed members, a sterndifficulty and anguish of the nature.6-7. But those who giving up all their actions to Me, and wholly devoted to Me,worship meditating on Me with an unswerving Yoga, those who fix on Me all theirconsciousness, O Partha, speedily I deliver them out of the sea of death-boundexistence.8. On Me repose all thy mind and lodge all thy understanding in Me; doubt notthat thou shalt dwell in Me above this mortal existence.9. And if thou art not able to keep the consciousness fixed steadily in Me, thenby the Yoga of practice seek after Me, O Dhananjaya.10. If thou art unable even to seek by practice, then be it thy supreme aim todo My work; doing all actions for My sake, thou shalt attain perfection.11. But if even this constant remembering of Me and lifting up of your works toMe is felt beyond your power, then renounce all fruit of action with the selfcontrolled.12. Better indeed is knowledge than practice, than knowledge, meditation isbetter; than meditation, renunciation of the fruit of action, on renunciationfollows peace.13-14. He who has no egoism, no I-ness and my-ness, who has friendship and pityfor all beings and hate for no living thing, who has a tranquil equality topleasure and pain, and is patient and forgiving, he who has a desirelesscontent, the steadfast control of self and the firm unshakable will andresolution of the Yogin and a love and devotion which gives up the whole mindand reason to Me, he is dear to Me.15. He by whom the world is not afflicted or troubled, who also is not afflictedor troubled by the world, who is freed from the troubled agitated lower natureand from its waves of joy and fear and anxiety and resentment, he is dear to Me.16. He who desires nothing, is pure, skilful in all actions, indifferent towhatever comes, not pained or afflicted by any result or happening, who hasgiven up all initiative of action, he, My devotee, is dear to Me.17. He who neither desires the pleasant and rejoices at its touch nor abhors theunpleasant and sorrows at its touch, who has abolished the distinction betweenfortunate and unfortunate happenings (because his devotion receives all thingsequally as good from the hands of his eternal Lover and Master), he is dear toMe.18-19. Equal to friend and enemy, equal to honour and insult, pleasure and pain,praise and blame, grief and happiness, heat and cold (to all that troubles withopposite affections the normal nature), silent, content and well-satisfied withanything and everything, not attached to person or thing, place or home, firm inmind (because it is constantly seated in the highest self and fixed for ever onthe one divine object of his love and adoration), that man is dear to Me.20. But exceedingly dear to Me are those devotees who make Me (the Purushottama)their one supreme aim and follow out with a perfect faith and exactitude theimmortalising Dharma described in this teaching."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIIITHE FIELD AND ITS KNOWER(13. THE YOGA OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE FIELD AND THE KNOWER OF THE FIELD)1. Arjuna said: Prakriti and Purusha, the Field and the Knower of the Field.Knowledge and the object of Knowledge, these I fain would learn, O Keshava.2. The Blessed Lord said: This body, O son of Kunti, is called the Field; thatwhich takes cognisance of the Field is called the Knower of the Field by thesages.3. Understand Me as the Knower of the Field in all Fields, O Bharata; it is theknowledge at once of the Field and its Knower which is the real illumination andonly wisdom.4. What that Field is and what are its character, nature, source, deformations,and what He is and what His Powers, hear that now briefly from Me.5. It has been sung by the Rishis in manifold ways in various inspired verses;and also by the Brahma Sutras which give us the rational and philosophicanalysis.6. The indiscriminate unmanifest Energy; the five elemental states of matter;the ten senses and the one (mind), intelligence and ego; the five objects of thesenses. (This is the constitution of the kshetra.)7. Liking and disliking, pleasure and pain (these are the principal deformationsof the kshetra): consciousness, collocation, persistence; these, brieflydescribed, constitute the Field and its deformations.8. A total absence of worldly pride and arrogance, harmlessness, a candid soul,a tolerant, long-suffering and benignant heart, purity of mind and body,tranquil firmness and steadfastness, self-control and a masterful government ofthe lower nature and the heart's worship given to the Teacher.9-10. A firm removal of the natural being's attraction to the objects of thesenses, a radical freedom from egoism. absence of clinging to the attachment andabsorption of family and home, a keen perception of the defective nature of theordinary life of physical man with its aimless and painful subjection to birthand death and disease and age, a constant equalness to all pleasant orunpleasant happenings.11-12. A meditative mind turned towards solitude and away from the vain noise ofcrowds and the assemblies of men, a philosophic perception of the true sense andlarge principles of existence, a tranquil continuity of inner spiritualknowledge and light, the Yoga of an unswerving devotion, love of God, theheart's deep and constant adoration of the universal and eternal Presence; thatis declared to be the knowledge; all against it is ignorance.13. I will declare the one object to which the mind of spiritual knowledge mustbe turned, by fixity in which the soul clouded here recovers and enjoys itsnature and original consciousness of immortality, the eternal supreme Brahmancalled neither Sat (existence) nor Asat (non-existence).14. His hands and feet are on every side of us, his heads and eyes and faces arethose innumerable visages which we see wherever we turn, his ear is everywhere,he immeasurably fills and surrounds all this world with himself, he is theuniversal Being in whose embrace we live.15. All the senses and their qualities reflect him but he is without any senses;he is unattached, yet all-supporting; he is enjoyer of the gunas, though notlimited by them.16. That which is in us is he and all that we experience outside ourselves ishe. The inward and the outward, the far and the near, the moving and theunmoving, all this he is at once. He is the subtlety of the subtle which isbeyond our knowledge.17. He is indivisible and the One, but seems to divide himself in forms andcreatures and appears as all the separate existences. All things are eternallyborn from him, upborne in his eternity, taken eternally back into his oneness.18. He is the light of all lights and luminous beyond all the darkness of ourignorance. He is knowledge and the object of knowledge. He is seated in thehearts of all.19. Thus the Field, Knowledge and the Object of Knowledge, have been brieflytold. My devotee, thus knowing, attains to My bhava (the divine being and divinenature).20. Know thou that Purusha (the Soul) and Prakriti (Nature) are both withoutorigin and eternal; but the modes of Nature and the lower forms she assumes toour conscious experience have an origin in Prakriti (in the transactions ofthese two entities).21. The chain of cause and effect and the state of being the doer are created byPrakriti; Purusha enjoys pleasure and pain.22. Purusha involved in Prakriti enjoys the qualities born of Prakriti;attachment to the qualities is the cause of his birth in good and evil wombs.23. Witness, source of the consent, upholder of the work of Nature, her enjoyer,almighty Lord and supreme Self is the Supreme Soul seated in this body.24. He who thus knows Purusha and Prakriti with her qualities, howsoever helives and acts, he shall not be born again.25. This knowledge comes by an inner meditation through which the eternal Selfbecomes apparent to us in our self-existence. Or it comes by the Yoga of theSankhyas (the separation of the soul from nature). Or it comes by the Yoga ofworks.26. Others, who are ignorant of these paths of Yoga, may hear of the truth fromothers and mould the mind into the sense of that to which it listens with faithand concentration. But however arrived at, it carries us beyond death toimmortality.27. Whatever being, moving or unmoving, is born, know thou, O best of theBharatas, that it is from the union between the Field and the Knower of theField.28. Seated equally in all beings, the supreme Lord, unperishing within theperishing – he who thus sees, he sees.29. Perceiving the equal Lord as the spiritual inhabitant in all forces, in allthings and in all beings, he does not injure himself (by casting his being intothe hands of desire and passions), and thus he attains to the supreme status.30. He who sees that all action is verily done by Prakriti, and that the Self isthe inactive witness, he sees.31. When he perceives the diversified existence of beings abiding in the oneeternal Being, and spreading forth from it, then he attains to Brahman.32. Because it is without origin and eternal, not limited by the qualities, theimperishable supreme Self, though seated in the body, O Kaunteya, does not act,nor is affected.33. As the all-pervading ether is not affected by reason of its subtlety, soseated everywhere in the body, the Self is not affected.34. As the one sun illumines the entire earth, so the Lord of the Fieldillumines the entire Field, O Bharata.35. They who with the eye of knowledge perceive this difference between theField and the Knower of the Field and the liberation of beings from Prakriti,they attain to the Supreme."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIVTHE THREE GUNAS(14. THE YOGA OF THE DIVISION OF THE THREE GUNAS)1. The Blessed Lord said: I will again declare the supreme Knowledge, thehighest of all knowings, which having known, all the sages have gone hence tothe highest perfection.2. Having taken refuge in this knowledge and become of like nature and law ofbeing with Me, they are not born in the creation, nor troubled by the anguish ofthe universal dissolution.3. My womb is the Mahat Brahman; into that I cast the seed; thence spring allbeings, O Bharata.4. Whatever forms are produced in whatsoever wombs, O Kaunteya, the MahatBrahman is their womb, and I am the Father who casts the seed.5. The three gunas born of Prakriti, Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas bind in the body, Ogreat-armed one, the imperishable dweller in the body.6. Of these Sattwa is by the purity of its quality a cause of light andillumination, and by virtue of that purity produces no disease or morbidity orsuffering in the nature: it binds by attachment to knowledge and attachment tohappiness, O sinless one.7. Rajas, know thou, has for its essence attraction of liking and longing; it isa child of the attachment of the soul to the desire of objects; O Kaunteya, itbinds the embodied spirit by attachment to works.8. But Tamas, know thou, born of ignorance, is the deluded of all embodiedbeings; it binds by negligence, indolence and sleep, O Bharata.9. Sattwa attaches to happiness, rajas to action, O Bharata; tamas covers up theknowledge and attaches to negligence of error and inaction.10. Now sattwa leads, having overpowered rajas and tamas, O Bharata; now rajas,having overpowered sattwa and tamas; and now tamas, having overpowered sattwaand rajas.11. When into all the doors in the body there comes a flooding of light, a lightof understanding, perception and knowledge, one should understand that there hasbeen a great increase and uprising of the sattwic guna in the nature.12. Greed, seeking impulsions, initiative of actions, unrest, desire – all thismounts in us when rajas increases.13. Nescience, inertia, negligence and delusion – these are born when tamaspredominates, O joy of the Kurus.14. If sattwa prevails when the embodied goes to dissolution, then he attains tothe spotless worlds of the knowers of the highest principles.15. Going to dissolution when rajas prevails, he is born among those attached toaction; if dissolved during the increase of tamas, he is born in the wombs ofbeings involved in nescience.16. It is said the fruit of works rightly done is pure and sattwic; pain is theconsequence of rajasic works, ignorance is the result of tamasic action.17. From sattwa knowledge is born, and greed from rajas; negligence and delusionare of tamas, and also ignorance.18. They rise upwards who are in sattwa; those in rajas remain in the middle;the tamasic, those enveloped in ignorance and inertia, the effect of the lowestquality, go downwards.19. When the seer perceives that the modes of Nature are the whole agency andcause of works and knows and turns to That which is supreme above the gunas, heattains to mad-bhava (the movement and status of the Divine).20. When the soul thus rises above the three gunas born of the embodiment inNature, he is freed from subjection to birth and death and their concomitants,decay, old age and suffering, and enjoys in the end the Immortality of itsself-existence.21. Arjuna said: What are the signs of the man who has risen above the threegunas, O Lord? What is his action and how does he surmount the gunas?22. The Blessed Lord said: He, O Pandava, who does not abhor or shrink from theoperation of enlightenment (the result of rising sattwa) or impulsion to works(the result of rising rajas) or the clouding over of the mental and nervousbeing (the result of rising tamas), nor longs after them, when they cease.23. He who, established in a position as of one seated high above, is unshakenby the gunas; who seeing that it is the gunas that are in process of actionstands apart immovable.24-25. He who regards happiness and suffering alike, gold and mud and stone asof equal value, to whom the pleasant and the unpleasant, praise and blame,honour and insult, the faction of his friends and the faction of his enemies areequal things; who is steadfast in a wise imperturbable and immutable inner calmand quietude; who initiates no action (but leaves all works to be done by thegunas of Nature) – he is said to be above the gunas.26. He also who loves and strives after Me with an undeviating love andadoration, passes beyond the three gunas and he too is prepared for becoming theBrahman.27. I (the Purushottama) am the foundation of the silent Brahman and ofImmortality and imperishable spiritual existence and of the eternal dharma andof an utter bliss of happiness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVTHE SUPREME DIVINE(15. THE YOGA OF THE SUPREME PERSON (PURUSHOTTAMA))1. The Blessed Lord said: With its original source above (in the Eternal), itsbranches stretching below, the Ashwattha is said to be eternal and imperishable;the leaves of it are the hymns of the Veda; he who knows it is the Veda-knower.2. The branches of this cosmic tree extend both below and above (below in thematerial, above in the supraphysical planes), they grow by the gunas of Nature;the sensible objects are its foliage, downward here into the world of men itplunges its roots of attachment and desire with their consequences of anendlessly developing action.3-4. The real form of it cannot be perceived by us in this material world ofman's embodiment, nor its beginning nor its end, nor its foundation, having cutdown this firmly rooted Ashwattha by the strong sword of detachment, one shouldseek for that highest goal whence, once having reached it. there is nocompulsion of return to mortal life; I turn away (says the Vedantic verse) toseek that original Soul alone from whom proceeds the ancient sempiternal urge toaction.5. To be free from the bewilderment of this lower Maya, without egoism, thegreat fault of attachment conquered, all desires stilled, the duality of joy andgrief cast away, always to be fixed in a pure spiritual consciousness, these arethe steps of the way to that supreme Infinite.6. There we find the timeless being which is not illumined by sun or moon orfire (but is itself the light of the presence of the eternal Purusha); havinggone thither they return not; that is the highest eternal status of My Being.7. It is an eternal portion of Me that becomes the Jiva in the world of livingcreatures and cultivates the subjective powers of Prakriti, mind and the fivesenses.8. When the Lord takes up this body (he brings in with him the mind and thesenses) and in his going forth too (casting away the body) he goes taking themas the wind takes the perfumes from a vase.9. The ear, the eye, the touch, the taste and the smell, using these and themind also, he enjoys the objects of mind and sense as the indwelling andoverdwelling Soul.10. The deluded do not perceive him in his coming in and his going forth or inhis staying and enjoying and assumption of quality; they perceive who have theeye of knowledge.11. The Yogins who strive, see the Lord in themselves; but though they strive todo so, the ignorant perceive Him not, as they are not formed in the spiritualmould.12. The light of the sun that illumines all this world, that which is in themoon and in fire, that light know as from Me.13. I have entered into this form of earth (and am the spirit of its materialforce) and sustain by My might these multitudes. I am the godhead of Soma who bythe rasa (the sap in the earth-mother) nourishes all plants and trees.14. I, having become the flame of life, sustain the physical body of livingcreatures, and united with Prana and Apana. digest the four kinds of food.15. I am lodged in the heart of all; from Me are memory and knowledge and theirabsence. And that which is known by all the Vedas (and by all forms of knowing)am I; and I indeed the knower of Veda and the maker of Vedanta.16. There are two Purushas (spiritual beings) in this world, the immutable (andimpersonal) and the mutable (and personal); the mutable is all these existences,the Kutastha (the high-seated consciousness of the Brahmic status) is called theimmutable.17. But other than these two is that highest spirit called the supreme Self, whoenters the three worlds and upbears them, the imperishable Lord.18. Since I am beyond the mutable and am greater and higher even than theimmutable, in the world and the Veda I am proclaimed as the Purushottama (thesupreme Self).19. He who undeluded thus has knowledge of Me as the Purushottama, adores Me(has bhakti for Me) with all-knowledge and in every way of his natural being.20. Thus by Me the most secret shastra (the supreme teaching and science) hasbeen told, O sinless one. Absolutely to know it is to be perfected inunderstanding and successful in the supreme sense, O Bharata."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTERXVI DEVA AND ASURA(16. THE YOGA OF DIVISION BETWEEN THE DIVINE AND THE DEMONICAL ENDOWMENTS)1-3. The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purity of temperament, steadfastnessin the Yoga of Knowledge, giving, self-control, sacrifice, the study ofScripture, askesis, candour and straightforwardness, harmlessness, truth,absence of wrath, self-denial, calm, absence of fault-finding, compassion to allbeings, absence of greed, gentleness, modesty, freedom from restlessness,energy, forgiveness, patience, cleanness, absence of envy and pride – these arethe wealth of the man born into the Deva nature.4. Pride, arrogance, excessive self-esteem, wrath, harshness, ignorance, these,O Partha, are the wealth of the man born into the Asuric nature.5. The Daivic qualities lead towards liberation, the Asuric towards bondage.Grieve not, thou art born in the Deva-nature, O Pandava.6. There are two creations of beings in this material world, the Daivic and theAsuric; the Daivic hath been described at length: hear from Me, O Partha, theAsuric.7. Asuric men have no true knowledge of the way of action or the way ofabstention; truth is not in them, nor clean doing, nor faithful observance.8. \"The world is without God,\" they say, \"not true, not founded in truth,brought about by a mutual union, with Desire for its sole cause, a world ofChance.\"9. Leaning on that way of seeing life, and by its falsehood ruining their soulsand their reason, the Asuric men become the centre or instrument of a fierce,Titanic, violent action, a power of destruction in the world, a fount of injuryand evil.10. Resorting to insatiable desire, arrogant, full of self-esteem and thedrunkenness of their pride, these misguided souls delude themselves, persist infalse and obstinate aims and pursue the fixed impure resolution of theirlongings.11. They imagine that desire and enjoyment are all the aim of life and (in theirinordinate and insatiable pursuit of it) they are the prey of a devouring, ameasurelessly unceasing care and thought and endeavour and anxiety till themoment of their death.12-15. Bound by a hundred bonds, devoured by wrath and lust, unweariedlyoccupied in amassing unjust gains which may serve their enjoyment and thesatisfaction of their craving, always they think. \"To-day I have gained thisobject of desire, to-morrow I shall have that other; to-day I have so muchwealth, more I will get to-morrow. I have killed this my enemy, the rest too Iwill kill. I am a lord and king of men, I am perfect, accomplished, strong,happy, fortunate, a privileged enjoyer of the world; I am wealthy, I am of highbirth; who is there like unto me? I will sacrifice, I will give, I will enjoy.\"16. Thus occupied by many egoistic ideas, deluded, addicted to the gratificationof desire (doing works, but doing them wrongly, acting mightily, but forthemselves, for desire, for enjoyment, not for God in themselves and God inman), they fall into the unclean hell of their own evil.17. They sacrifice and give not in the true order, but from a self-regardingostentation, from vanity and with a stiff and foolish pride.18. In the egoism of their strength and power, in the violence of their wrathand arrogance they hate, despise and belittle the God hidden in themselves andthe God in man.19. These proud haters (of good and of God), evil, cruel, vilest among men inthe world, I cast down continually into more and more Asuric births.20. Cast into Asuric wombs, deluded birth after birth, they find Me not (as theydo not seek Me) and sink down into the lowest status of soul-nature.21. Threefold are the doors of Hell, destructive of the soul – desire, wrath andgreed: therefore let man renounce these three.22. A man liberated from these doors of darkness, O son of Kunti, follows hisown higher good and arrives at the highest soul-status.23. He who, having cast aside the rules of the Shastra, followeth the promptingsof desire, attaineth not to perfection, nor happiness, nor the highestsoul-status.24. Therefore let the Shastra be thy authority in determining what ought to bedone or what ought not to be done. Knowing what hath been declared by the rulesof the Shastra, thou oughtest to work in this world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIIFAITH AND THE THREE GUNAS(17. THE YOGA OF THE THREEFOLD DIVISION OF FAITH)1. Arjuna said: When men sacrifice to God or the gods with faith, but abandonthe rule of the Shastra. what is that concentrated will of devotion in them,nishtha, which gives them this faith and moves them to this kind of action. OKrishna? Is it sattwa, rajas or tamas?2. The Blessed Lord said: The faith in embodied beings is of a triple kind likeall things in Nature and varies according to the dominating quality of theirnature, sattwa. rajas or tamas. Hear thou of these.3. The faith of each man takes the shape given to it by his stuff of being, OBharata. This Purusha, this soul in man, is, as it were, made of shraddha, afaith, a will to be a belief in itself and existence, and whatever is that will,faith or constituting belief in him, he is that and that is he.4. Sattwic men offer sacrifice to the gods, the rajasic to the Yakshas (thekeepers of wealth) and the Rakshasic forces, the others, the tamasic, offertheir sacrifice to elemental powers and grosser spirits.5-6. The men who perform violent austerities, contrary to the Shastra, witharrogance and egoism, impelled by the force of their desires and passions, menof unripe minds tormenting the aggregated elements forming the body andtroubling Me also, seated in the body, know these to be Asuric in theirresolves.7. The food also which is dear to each is of triple character, as alsosacrifice, askesis and giving. Hear thou the distinction of these.8. The sattwic temperament in the mental and physical body turns naturally tothe things that increase the life, increase the inner and outer strength,nourish at once the mental, vital and physical force and increase the pleasureand satisfaction and happy condition of mind and life and body, all that issucculent and soft and firm and satisfying.9. The rajasic temperament prefers naturally food that is violently sour,pungent, hot, acrid, rough and strong and burning, the aliments that increaseill-health and the distempers of the mind and body.10. The tamasic temperament takes a perverse pleasure in cold, impure, stale,rotten or tasteless food or even accepts like the animals the remnantshalf-eaten by others.11. The sacrifice which is offered by men without desire for the personal fruit,which is executed according to the right principle, and with a mind concentratedon the idea of the thing to be done as a sacrifice, that is sattwic.12. The sacrifice offered with a view to the personal fruit, and also forostentation, O best of the Bharatas, know thou that to be of a rajasic nature.13. The sacrifice not performed according to the right rule of the Shastra,without giving of food, without the mantra, without gifts, empty of faith, issaid to be tamasic.14. Worship given to the godhead, to the twice-born, to the spiritual guide, tothe wise, cleanness, candid dealing, sexual purity and avoidance of killing andinjury to others, are called the askesis of the body.15. Speech causing no trouble to others, true, kind and beneficial, the study ofScripture, are called the askesis of speech.16. A clear and calm gladness of mind, gentleness, silence, self-control, thepurifying of the whole temperament – this is called the askesis of the mind.17. This threefold askesis, done with a highest enlightened faith, with nodesire for fruit, harmonised, is said to be sattwic.18. The askesis which is undertaken to get honour and worship from men, for thesake of outward glory and greatness and for ostentation is said to be rajasic,unstable and fleeting.19. That askesis which is pursued under a clouded and deluded idea, performedwith effort and suffering imposed on oneself or else with a concentration of theenergy in a will to do hurt to others, that is said to be tamasic.20. The sattwic way of giving is to do it for the sake of the giving and thebeneficence and to one who does no benefit in return; and it is to bestow in theright conditions of time and place and on the right recipient (who is worthy orto whom the gift can be really helpful).21. The rajasic kind of giving is that which is done with unwillingness orviolence to oneself or with a personal and egoistic object or in the hope of areturn of some kind.22. The tamasic gift is offered with no consideration of the right conditions oftime, place and object; it is offered without regard for the feelings of therecipient and despised by him even in the acceptance.23. The formula OM, Tat, Sat, is the triple definition of the Brahman, by whomthe Brahmanas, the Vedas and sacrifices were created of old.24. Therefore with the pronunciation of OM the acts of sacrifice, giving andaskesis as laid down in the rules are always commenced by the knowers of theBrahman.25. With the pronunciation of Tat and without desire of fruit are performed thevarious acts of sacrifice, askesis and giving by the seekers of liberation.26. Sat means good and it means existence; likewise, O Partha, the word Sat isused in the sense of a good work (for all good works prepare the soul for thehigher reality of our being).27. All firm abiding in sacrifice, giving and askesis and all works done withthat central view, as sacrifice, as giving, as askesis, are Sat (for they buildthe basis for the highest truth of our spirit).28. Whatever is wrought without faith, oblation, giving, askesis or other work,Asat it is called, O Partha; it is nought, here or hereafter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIIIRENUNCIATION AND MOKSHA(18. THE YOGA OF THE RUNUNCIATION OF LIBERATION)1. Arjuna said: I desire, O mighty-armed, to know the principle of Sannyasa andthe principle of Tyaga, O Hrishikesha, and their difference, O Keshinisudana.2. The Blessed Lord said: Sages have known as Sannyasa the physical depositing(or laying aside) of desirable actions; Tyaga is the name given by the wise toan entire abandonment of all attached clinging to the fruit of works.3. \"All action should be relinquished as an evil\", declare some learned men,\"acts of sacrifice, giving and askesis ought not to be renounced\", say others.4. Hear my conclusions as to renunciation (Tyaga), O best of the Bharatas; sincerenunciation of works, O tiger of men, has been explained as threefold.5. Acts of sacrifice, giving and askesis ought not to be renounced at all, butshould be performed, for they purify the wise.6. Even these actions certainly ought to be done, O Partha, leaving asideattachment and fruit.7. Verily, renunciation of rightly regulated actions is not proper, to renouncethem from ignorance is a tamasic renunciation.8. He who gives up works because they bring sorrow or are a trouble to theflesh, thus doing rajasic renunciation, obtaineth not the fruit of renunciation.9. He who performs a rightly regulated action, because it has to be done,without any attachment either to the action or to the fruit of the action, thatrenunciation is regarded as sattwic.10. The wise man with doubts cast away, who renounces in the light of the fullsattwic mind, has no aversion to unpleasant action, no attachment to pleasantaction.11. Nor indeed can embodied beings renounce all works; verily he who gives upthe fruit of action, he is said to be a renouncer.12. The three kinds of result, pleasant, unpleasant and mixed, in this or otherworlds, in this or another life are for the slaves of desire and ego; thesethings do not cling to the free spirit.13. These five causes, O mighty-armed, learn of Me as laid down by the Sankhyafor the accomplishment of all works.14. These five are the body, the doer, the various instruments, the many kindsof efforts, and last, the Fate.15. These five elements make up among them all the efficient causes, karana,that determine the shaping and outcome of whatever work man undertakes with mindand speech and body.16. That being so, he verily who, owing to ignorant understanding, looketh onthe pure Self as the doer, he, of perverted intelligence, seeth not.17. He who is free from the ego-sense, whose intelligence is not affected,though he slay these peoples, he slayeth not, nor is bound.18. Knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower, these three thingsconstitute the mental impulsion to work; there are again three things, the doer,the instrument and the work done, that hold the action together and make itpossible.19. Knowledge, work and doer are of three kinds, says the Sankhya, according tothe difference in the Gunas (qualities); hear thou duly these also.20. That by which one imperishable being is seen in all becoming, oneindivisible whole in all these divisions, know thou that knowledge as sattwic.21. But that knowledge which sees the multiplicity of things only in theirseparateness and variety of operation in all these existences, that knowledgeknow thou as rajasic.22. The tamasic knowledge is a small and narrow way of looking at things whichhas no eye for the real nature of the word; it clings to one movement or oneroutine as if it were the whole (without foresight or comprehendingintelligence).23. All action which is rightly regulated, performed without attachment, withoutliking or disliking (for its spur or its drag), done by one undesirous of fruit,that is called sattwic.24. But that action which a man undertakes under the dominion of desire, or withan egoistic sense of his own personality in the action, and which is done withinordinate effort (with a great heaving and straining of the personal will toget at the object of desire), that is declared to be rajasic.25. The action undertaken from delusion (in mechanical obedience to theinstincts, impulsions and unseeing ideas), without regarding the strength orcapacity, without regarding the consequences, the waste of effort or injury toothers, that is declared to be tamasic.26. Free from attachment, free from egoism, full of a fixed (impersonal)resolution and a calm rectitude of zeal, unelated by success, undepressed byfailure, that doer is called sattwic.27. Eagerly attached to the work, passionately desirous of fruit, greedy,impure, often violent and cruel and brutal in the means he uses, full of joy (insuccess) and grief (in failure) such a doer is known as rajasic.28. One who acts with a mechanical mind (who does not put himself really intothe work), is stupid, obstinate, cunning, insolent, lazy, easily depressed,procrastinating, that doer is called tamasic.29. Reason as also persistence are of three kinds according to the qualities;hear them related, unreservedly and severally, O Dhananjaya.30. That which sees the law of action and the law of abstention from action, thething that is to be done and the thing that is not to be done, what is to befeared and what is not to be feared, what binds the spirit of man and what setsit free, that understanding is sattwic, O Partha.31. That by which one knows awry right and wrong and also what should or shouldnot be done, that understanding, O Partha, is rajasic.32. That which, enveloped in darkness, takes what is not the true law andupholds it as the law and sees all things in a cloud of misconceptions, thatunderstanding, O Partha, is tamasic.33. That unwavering persistence by which, through Yoga, one controls the mind,the senses and the life, that persistence, O Partha, is sattwic.34. But that, O Arjuna, by which one holdeth fast right and justice (Dharma),interest (Artha) and Pleasure (Kama), and with great attachment desires for thefruits, persistence, O Partha, is tamasic.35. That by which one from ignorance doth not abandon sleep, fear, grief,depression, and also pride, that persistence, O Partha, is tamasic.36-37. And now the threefold kinds of pleasure hear thou from Me, O bull of theBharatas. That in which one by self-discipline rejoiceth and which putteth anend to pain; which at first is as poison but in the end is as nectar; thatpleasure is said to be sattwic, born of the satisfaction of the higher mind andspirit.38. That which is born from the contact of the senses with their objects, whichat first is as nectar, but in the end is like poison, that pleasure is accountedrajasic.39. That pleasure of which delusion is the beginning and delusion is theconsequence, which arises from sleep, indolence and ignorance, that is declaredtamasic.40. There is not an entity, either on the earth or again in heaven among thegods, that is not subject to the workings of these three qualities (Gunas), bornof nature.41. The works of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras are dividedaccording to the qualities (gunas) born of their own inner nature.42. Calm, self-control, askesis, purity, long-suffering, candour, knowledge,acceptance of spiritual truth are the work of the Brahmin, born of his swabhava.43. Heroism, high spirit, resolution, ability, not fleeing in the battle,giving, lordship (ishwara-bhava, the temperament of the ruler and leader) arethe natural work of the Kshatriya.44. Agriculture, cattle-keeping, trade inclusive of the labour of the craftsmanand the artisan are the natural work of the Vaishya. All work of the characterof service falls within the natural function of the Shudra.45. A man who is intent on his own natural work attains perfection. Listen thouhow perfection is won by him who is intent on his own natural work.46. He from whom all beings originate, by whom all this universe is pervaded, byworshipping Him by his own work, a man reacheth perfection.47. Better is one's own law of works, though in itself faulty, than an alien lawwell wrought out. One does not incur sin when one acts in agreement with the lawof one's own nature.48. The inborn work, O son of Kunti, though defective, ought not to beabandoned. All actions (in the three gunas) indeed are clouded by defects asfire by smoke.49. An understanding without attachment in all things, a soul self-conquered andempty of desire, man attains by renunciation a supreme perfection ofnaishkarmya.50. How, having attained this perfection, one thus attains to the Brahman, hearfrom me, O son of Kunti, – that which is the supreme concentrated direction ofthe knowledge.51-53. Uniting the purified intelligence (with the pure spiritual substance inus), controlling the whole being by firm and steady will, having renounced soundand the other objects of the senses, withdrawing from all liking and disliking,resorting to impersonal solitude, abstemious, speech, body and mind controlled,constantly united with the inmost self by meditation, completely giving updesire and attachment, having put away egoism, violence, arrogance, desire,wrath, the sense and instinct of possession, free from all I-ness and my-ness,calm and luminously impassive – one is fit to become the Brahman.54. When one has become the Brahman, when one, serene in the Self, neithergrieves nor desires, when one is equal to all beings, then one gets the supremelove and devotion to Me.55. By devotion he comes to know Me, who and how much I am and in all thereality and principles of My being; having thus known Me he entereth into That(Purushottama).56. And by doing also all actions always lodged in Me he attains by My grace theeternal and imperishable status.57. Devoting all thyself to Me, giving up in thy conscious mind all thy actionsinto Me, resorting to Yoga of the will and intelligence be always one in heartand consciousness with Me.58. If thou art one in heart and consciousness with Me at all times, then by Mygrace thou shalt pass safe through all difficult and perilous passages; but iffrom egoism thou hear not, thou shalt fall into perdition.59. Vain is this thy resolve, that in thy egoism thou thinkest, saying \"I willnot fight\"; thy nature shall appoint thee to thy work.60. What from delusion thou desirest not to do, O Kaunteya, that helplessly thoushalt do bound by thy own work born of thy swabhava.61. The Lord, O Arjuna, is seated in the heart of all beings turning all beingsmounted upon a machine by his Maya.62. In him take refuge in every way of thy being and by his grace thou shaltcome to the supreme peace and the eternal status.63. So have I expounded to thee a knowledge more secret than that which ishidden; having reflected on it fully, do as thou wouldst.64. Further hear the most secret, the supreme word that I shall speak to thee;beloved art thou intimately of Me, therefore will I speak for thy good.65. Become my-minded, my lover and adorer, a sacrificer to Me, bow thyself toMe, to Me thou shalt come, this is my pledge and promise to thee, for dear artthou to Me.66. Abandon all dharmas and take refuge in Me alone. I will deliver thee fromall sin and evil, do not grieve.67. Never is this to be spoken by thee to one without askesis, not to one thatis not devoted and not to him who does no service; nor yet to him who despisesand belittles Me (lodged in the human body).68. He who with the highest devotion for Me, shall declare this supreme secretamong My devotees, without doubt he shall come to Me.69. And there is none among men that does more than he what is most dear to Me;and there will be none else dearer to Me in the world.70. And he who shall study this sacred discourse of ours, by him I shall beworshipped with the sacrifice of knowledge.71. The man also who, full of faith and uncarping, listens to this, even he,being liberated, attains to the happy worlds of the righteous.72. Hath this been heard by thee, O son of Pritha, with a concentrated mind? Hasthy delusion, caused by ignorance, been destroyed, O Dhananjaya?73. Arjuna said: Destroyed is my delusion, I have regained memory through Thygrace, O Infallible One. I am firm, dispelled are my doubts. I will actaccording to Thy word.74. Sanjaya said: I heard this wonderful discourse of Vasudeva and of thegreat-souled Partha, causing my hair to stand on end.75. Through the grace of Vyasa I heard this supreme secret, this Yoga directlyfrom Krishna, the divine Master of Yoga, who himself declared it.76. O King, remembering, remembering this wonderful and sacred discourse ofKeshava and Arjuna, I rejoice again and again.77. Remembering, remembering also that most marvellous form of Hari, great is mywonder. O King, I rejoice, again and again.78. Wherever is Krishna, the Master of Yoga, wherever is Partha, the archer,assured are there glory, victory and prosperity, and there also is the immutableLaw of Right."}]
