The book accepts the canonical western tradition and rejects themodernist idea that culture has collapsed into meaningless fragments. I arguethat Judeo-Christianity never did defeat paganism, which still flourishes inart, eroticism, astrology, and pop culture.The first volume of Sexual Personae examines antiquity, the Renaissance, andRomanticism from the late eighteenth century to 1900. I demonstrate thatRomanticism turns almost immediately into Decadence, which I find throughoutmajor nineteenth-century authors, even Emily Dickinson. The second volume willshow how movies, television, sports, and rock music embody all the pagan themesof classical antiquity. My approach throughout the book combines disciplines:literature, art history, psychology, and religion.What is art? How and why does an artist create? The amorality, aggression,sadism, voyeurism, and pornography in great art have been ignored or glossedover by most academic critics. I fill in the space between artist and art workwith metaphors drawn from the Cambridge School of Anthropology. My largestambition is to fuse Frazer with Freud.What is sex? What is nature? I see sex and nature as brutal pagan forces. Mystress on the truth in sexual stereotypes and on the biologic basis of sexdifferences is sure to cause controversy. I reaffirm and celebrate woman’sancient mystery and glamour. I see the mother as an overwhelming force whocondemns men to lifelong sexual anxiety, from which they escape throughrationalism and physical achievement.I show how much of western life, art, and thought is ruled by personality, whichthe book traces through recurrent types or personae (“masks”). My title wasinspired by Ingmar Bergman’s cruel, dreamy masterpiece, Persona (1966). Mymethod is a form of sensationalism: I try to flesh out intellect with emotionand to induce a wide range of emotion from the reader. I want to show meaningarising from simple everyday things—cats, grocery stores, bridges, chanceencounters—and thereby to liberate criticism and interpretation from theirimprisonment in classroom and library."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSHarold Bloom has been a tremendous source of encouragement and practical helpthroughout this project.

The background from which and against which ourideas of God were formed, nature remains the supreme moral problem. We cannothope to understand sex and gender until we clarify our attitude toward nature.Sex is a subset to nature. Sex is the natural in man.Society is an artificial construction, a defense against nature’s power. Withoutsociety, we would be storm-tossed on the barbarous sea that is nature. Societyis a system of inherited forms reducing our humiliating passivity to nature. Wemay alter these forms, slowly or suddenly, but no change in society will changenature. Human beings are not nature’s favorites. We are merely one of amultitude of species upon which nature indiscriminately exerts its force. Naturehas a master agenda we can only dimly know.Human life began in flight and fear. Religion rose from rituals of propitiation,spells to lull the punishing elements. To this day, communities are few inregions scorched by heat or shackled by ice. Civilized man conceals from himselfthe extent of his subordination to nature. The grandeur of culture, theconsolation of religion absorb his attention and win his faith. But let natureshrug, and all is in ruin. Fire, flood, lightning, tornado, hurricane, volcano,earthquake—anywhere at any time. Disaster falls upon the good and bad. Civilizedlife requires a state of illusion. The idea of the ultimate benevolence ofnature and God is the most potent of man’s survival mechanisms. Without it,culture would revert to fear and despair.Sexuality and eroticism are the intricate intersection of nature and culture.Feminists grossly oversimplify the problem of sex when they reduce it to amatter of social convention: readjust society, eliminate sexual inequality,purify sex roles, and happiness and harmony will reign. Here feminism, like allliberal movements of the past two hundred years, is heir to Rousseau. The SocialContract (1762) begins: “Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.”Pitting benign Romantic nature against corrupt society, Rousseau produced theprogressivist strain in nineteenth-century culture, for which social reform wasthe means to achieve paradise on earth. The bubble of these hopes was burst bythe catastrophes of two world wars. But Rousseauism was reborn in the postwargeneration of the Sixties, from which contemporary feminism developed.Rousseau rejects original sin, Christianity’s pessimistic view of man bornunclean, with a propensity for evil. Rousseau’s idea, derived from Locke, ofman’s innate goodness led to social environmentalism, now the dominant ethic ofAmerican human services, penal codes, and behaviorist therapies. It assumes thataggression, violence, and crime come from social deprivation—a poorneighborhood, a bad home. Thus feminism blames rape on pornography and, by asmug circularity of reasoning, interprets outbreaks of sadism as a backlash toitself. But rape and sadism have been evident throughout history and, at somemoment, in all cultures.This book takes the point of view of Sade, the most unread major writer inwestern literature. Sade’s work is a comprehensive satiric critique of Rousseau,written in the decade after the first failed Rousseauist experiment, the FrenchRevolution, which ended not in political paradise but in the hell of the Reignof Terror. Sade follows Hobbes rather than Locke. Aggression comes from nature;it is what Nietzsche is to call the will-to-power. For Sade, getting back tonature (the Romantic imperative that still permeates our culture from sexcounseling to cereal commercials) would be to give free rein to violence andlust. I agree. Society is not the criminal but the force which keeps crime incheck. When social controls weaken, man’s innate cruelty bursts forth. Therapist is created not by bad social influences but by a failure of socialconditioning. Feminists, seeking to drive power relations out of sex, have setthemselves against nature. Sex is power. Identity is power. In western culture,there are no nonexploitative relationships. Everyone has killed in order tolive. Nature’s universal law of creation from destruction operates in mind as inmatter. As Freud, Nietzsche’s heir, asserts, identity is conflict. Eachgeneration drives its plow over the bones of the dead.Modern liberalism suffers unresolved contradictions. It exalts individualism andfreedom and, on its radical wing, condemns social orders as oppressive. On theother hand, it expects government to provide materially for all, a featmanageable only by an expansion of authority and a swollen bureaucracy. In otherwords, liberalism defines government as tyrant father but demands it behave asnurturant mother. Feminism has inherited these contradictions. It sees everyhierarchy as repressive, a social fiction; every negative about woman is a malelie designed to keep her in her place. Feminism has exceeded its proper missionof seeking political equality for women and has ended by rejecting contingency,that is, human limitation by nature or fate.Sexual freedom, sexual liberation. A modern delusion. We are hierarchicalanimals. Sweep one hierarchy away, and another will take its place, perhaps lesspalatable than the first. There are hierarchies in nature and alternatehierarchies in society. In nature, brute force is the law, a survival of thefittest. In society, there are protections for the weak. Society is our frailbarrier against nature. When the prestige of state and religion is low, men arefree, but they find freedom intolerable and seek new ways to enslave themselves,through drugs or depression. My theory is that whenever sexual freedom is soughtor achieved, sadomasochism will not be far behind. Romanticism always turns intodecadence. Nature is a hard taskmaster. It is the hammer and the anvil, crushingindividuality. Perfect freedom would be to die by earth, air, water, and fire.Sex is a far darker power than feminism has admitted. Behaviorist sex therapiesbelieve guiltless, no-fault sex is possible. But sex has always been girt roundwith taboo, irrespective of culture. Sex is the point of contact between man andnature, where morality and good intentions fall to primitive urges. I called itan intersection. This intersection is the uncanny crossroads of Hecate, whereall things return in the night. Eroticism is a realm stalked by ghosts. It isthe place beyond the pale, both cursed and enchanted.This book shows how much in culture goes against our best wishes. Integration ofman’s body and mind is a profound problem that is not about to be solved byrecreational sex or an expansion of women’s civil rights. Incarnation, thelimitation of mind by matter, is an outrage to imagination. Equally outrageousis gender, which we have not chosen but which nature has imposed upon us. Ourphysicality is torment, our body the tree of nature on which Blake sees uscrucified.Sex is daemonic. This term, current in Romantic studies of the past twenty-fiveyears, derives from the Greek daimon, meaning a spirit of lower divinity thanthe Olympian gods (hence my pronunciation “daimonic”). The outcast Oedipusbecomes a daemon at Colonus. The word came to mean a man’s guardian shadow.Christianity turned the daemonic into the demonic. The Great daemons were notevil—or rather they were both good and evil, like nature itself, in which theydwelled. Freud’s unconscious is a daemonic realm. In the day we are socialcreatures, but at night we descend to the dream world where nature reigns, wherethere is no law but sex, cruelty, and metamorphosis. Day itself is invaded bydaemonic night. Moment by moment, night flickers in the imagination, ineroticism, subverting our strivings for virtue and order, giving an uncanny aurato objects and persons, revealed to us through the eyes of the artist.The ghost-ridden character of sex is implicit in Freud’s brilliant theory of“family romance.” We each have an incestuous constellation of sexual personaethat we carry from childhood to the grave and that determines whom and how welove or hate. Every encounter with friend or foe, every clash with or submissionto authority bears the perverse traces of family romance. Love is a crowdedtheater, for as Harold Bloom remarks, “We can never embrace (sexually orotherwise) a single person, but embrace the whole of her or his familyromance.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch01note1a] We still know next to nothing of themystery of cathexis, the investment of libido in certain people or things. Theelement of free will in sex and emotion is slight. As poets know, falling inlove is irrational.Like art, sex is fraught with symbols. Family romance means that adult sex isalways representation, ritualistic acting out of vanished realities. A perfectlyhumane eroticism may be impossible. Somewhere in every family romance ishostility and aggression, the homicidal wishes of the unconscious. Children aremonsters of unbridled egotism and will, for they spring directly from nature,hostile intimations of immorality. We carry that daemonic will within usforever. Most people conceal it with acquired ethical precepts and meet it onlyin their dreams, which they hastily forget upon waking. The will-to-power isinnate, but the sexual scripts of family romance are learned. Human beings arethe only creatures in whom consciousness is so entangled with animal instinct.In western culture, there can never be a purely physical or anxiety-free sexualencounter. Every attraction, every pattern of touch, every orgasm is shaped bypsychic shadows.The search for freedom through sex is doomed to failure. In sex, compulsion andancient Necessity rule. The sexual personae of family romance are obliterated bythe tidal force of regression, the backwards movement toward primevaldissolution, which Ferenczi identifies with ocean. An orgasm is a domination, asurrender, or a breaking through. Nature is no respecter of human identity. Thisis why so many men turn away or flee after sex, for they have sensed theannihilation of the daemonic. Western love is a displacement of cosmicrealities. It is a defense mechanism rationalizing forces ungoverned andungovernable. Like early religion, it is a device enabling us to control ourprimal fear.Sex cannot be understood because nature cannot be understood. Science is amethod of logical analysis of nature’s operations. It has lessened human anxietyabout the cosmos by demonstrating the materiality of nature’s forces, and theirfrequent predictability. But science is always playing catch-up ball. Naturebreaks its own rules whenever it wants. Science cannot avert a singlethunderbolt. Western science is a product of the Apollonian mind: its hope isthat by naming and classification, by the cold light of intellect, archaic nightcan be pushed back and defeated.Name and person are part of the west’s quest for form. The west insists on thediscrete identity of objects. To name is to know; to know is to control. I willdemonstrate that the west’s greatness arises from this delusional certitude. FarEastern culture has never striven against nature in this way. Compliance, notconfrontation is its rule. Buddhist meditation seeks the unity and harmony ofreality. Twentieth-century physics, going full circle back to Heracleitus,postulates that all matter is in motion. In other words, there is no thing, onlyenergy. But this perception has not been imaginatively absorbed, for it cancelsthe west’s intellectual and moral assumptions.The westerner knows by seeing. Perceptual relations are at the heart of ourculture, and they have produced our titanic contributions to art. Walking innature, we see, identify, name, recognize. This recognition is our apotropaion,that is, our warding off of fear. Recognition is ritual cognition, arepetition-compulsion. We say that nature is beautiful. But this aestheticjudgment, which not all peoples have shared, is another defense formation,woefully inadequate for encompassing nature’s totality. What is pretty in natureis confined to the thin skin of the globe upon which we huddle. Scratch thatskin, and nature’s daemonic ugliness will erupt.Our focus on the pretty is an Apollonian strategy. The leaves and flowers, thebirds, the hills are a patchwork pattern by which we map the known. What thewest represses in its view of nature is the chthonian, which means “of theearth”—but earth’s bowels, not its surface. Jane Harrison uses the term forpre-Olympian Greek religion, and I adopt it as a substitute for Dionysian, whichhas become contaminated with vulgar pleasantries. The Dionysian is no picnic. Itis the chthonian realities which Apollo evades, the blind grinding ofsubterranean force, the long slow suck, the murk and ooze. It is thedehumanizing brutality of biology and geology, the Darwinian waste andbloodshed, the squalor and rot we must block from consciousness to retain ourApollonian integrity as persons. Western science and aesthetics are attempts torevise this horror into imaginatively palatable form.The daemonism of chthonian nature is the west’s dirty secret. Modern humanistsmade the “tragic sense of life” the touchstone of mature understanding. Theydefined man’s mortality and the transience of time as literature’s supremesubjects. In this I again see evasion and even sentimentality. The tragic senseof life is a partial response to experience. It is a reflex of the west’sresistance to and misapprehension of nature, compounded by the errors ofliberalism, which in its Romantic nature-philosophy has followed the RousseauistWordsworth rather than the daemonic Coleridge.Tragedy is the most western literary genre. It did not appear in Japan until thelate nineteenth century. The western will, setting itself up against nature,dramatized its own inevitable fall as a human universal, which it is not. Anirony of literary history is the birth of tragedy in the cult of Dionysus. Theprotagonist’s destruction recalls the slaughter of animals and, even earlier, ofreal human beings in archaic ritual. It is no accident that tragedy as we knowit dates from the Apollonian fifth century of Athens’ greatness, whose cardinalwork is Aeschylus’ Oresteia, a celebration of the defeat of chthonian power.Drama, a Dionysian mode, turned against Dionysus in making the passage fromritual to mimesis, that is, from action to representation. Aristotle’s “pity andfear” is a broken promise, a plea for vision without horror.Few Greek tragedies fully conform to the humanist commentary on them. Theirbarbaric residue will not come unglued. Even in the fifth century, as we shallsee, a satiric response to Apollonianized theater came in Euripides’ decadentplays. Problems in accurate assessment of Greek tragedy include not only theloss of three-quarters of the original body of work but the lack of survival ofany complete satyr-play. This was the finale to the classic trilogy, an obscenecomic burlesque. In Greek tragedy, comedy always had the last word. Moderncriticism has projected a Victorian and, I feel, Protestant high seriousnessupon pagan culture that still blankets teaching of the humanities.Paradoxically, assent to savage chthonian realities leads not to gloom but tohumor. Hence Sade’s strange laughter, his wit amid the most fantastic cruelties.For life is not a tragedy but a comedy. Comedy is born of the clash betweenApollo and Dionysus. Nature is always pulling the rug out from under our pompousideals.Female tragic protagonists are rare. Tragedy is a male paradigm of rise andfall, a graph in which dramatic and sexual climax are in shadowy analogy. Climaxis another western invention. Traditional eastern stories are picaresque,horizontal chains of incident. There is little suspense or sense of an ending.The sharp vertical peaking of western narrative, as later of orchestral music,is exemplified by Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex, whose moment of maximum intensityAristotle calls peripeteia, reversal. Western dramatic climax was produced bythe agon of male will. Through action to identity. Action is the route of escapefrom nature, but all action circles back to origins, the womb-tomb of nature.Oedipus, trying to escape his mother, runs straight into her arms. Westernnarrative is a mystery story, a process of detection. But since what is detectedis unbearable, every revelation leads to another repression.The major women of tragedy—Euripides’ Medea and Phaedra, Shakespeare’s Cleopatraand Lady Macbeth, Racine’s Phèdre—skew the genre by their disruptive relation tomale action. Tragic woman is less moral than man. Her will-to-power is naked.Her actions are under a chthonian cloud. They are a conduit of the irrational,opening the genre to intrusions of the barbaric force that drama shut out at itsbirth. Tragedy is a western vehicle for testing and purification of the malewill. The difficulty in grafting female protagonists onto it is a result not ofmale prejudice but of instinctive sexual strategics. Woman introducesuntransformed cruelty into tragedy because she is the problem that the genre istrying to correct.Tragedy plays a male game, a game it invented to snatch victory from the jaws ofdefeat. It is not flawed choice, flawed action, or even death itself which isthe ultimate human dilemma. The gravest challenge to our hopes and dreams is themessy biological business-as-usual that is going on within us and without us atevery hour of every day. Consciousness is a pitiful hostage of itsflesh-envelope, whose surges, circuits, and secret murmurings it cannot stay orspeed. This is the chthonian drama that has no climax but only an endless round,cycle upon cycle. Microcosm mirrors macrocosm. Free will is stillborn in the redcells of our body, for there is no free will in nature. Our choices come to usprepackaged and special delivery, molded by hands not our own.Tragedy’s inhospitality to woman springs from nature’s inhospitality to man. Theidentification of woman with nature was universal in prehistory. In hunting oragrarian societies dependent upon nature, femaleness was honored as an immanentprinciple of fertility. As culture progressed, crafts and commerce supplied aconcentration of resources freeing men from the caprices of weather or thehandicap of geography. With nature at one remove, femaleness receded inimportance.Buddhist cultures retained the ancient meanings of femaleness long after thewest renounced them. Male and female, the Chinese yang and yin, are balanced andinterpenetrating powers in man and nature, to which society is subordinate. Thiscode of passive acceptance has its roots in India, a land of sudden extremeswhere a monsoon can wipe out 50,000 people overnight. The femaleness offertility religions is always double-edged. The Indian nature-goddess Kali iscreator and destroyer, granting boons with one set of arms while cutting throatswith the other. She is the lady ringed with skulls. The moral ambivalence of thegreat mother goddesses has been conveniently forgotten by those Americanfeminists who have resurrected them. We cannot grasp nature’s bare blade withoutshedding our own blood.Western culture from the start has swerved from femaleness. The last majorwestern society to worship female powers was Minoan Crete. And significantly,that fell and did not rise again. The immediate cause of its collapse—quake,plague, or invasion—is beside the point. The lesson is that cultic femaleness isno guarantee of cultural strength or viability. What did survive, what didvanquish circumstance and stamp its mind-set on Europe was Mycenaean warriorculture, descending to us through Homer. The male will-to-power: Mycenaeans fromthe south and Dorians from the north would fuse to form Apollonian Athens, fromwhich came the Greco-Roman line of western history.Both the Apollonian and Judeo-Christian traditions are transcendental. That is,they seek to surmount or transcend nature. Despite Greek culture’s contraryDionysian element, which I will discuss, high classicism was an Apollonianachievement. Judaism, Christianity’s parent sect, is the most powerful ofprotests against nature. The Old Testament asserts that a father god made natureand that differentiation into objects and gender was after the fact of hismaleness. Judeo-Christianity, like Greek worship of the Olympian gods, is asky-cult. It is an advanced stage in the history of religion, which everywherebegan as earth-cult, veneration of fruitful nature.The evolution from earth-cult to sky-cult shifts woman into the nether realm.Her mysterious procreative powers and the resemblance of her rounded breasts,belly, and hips to earth’s contours put her at the center of early symbolism.She was the model for the Great Mother figures who crowded the birth of religionworldwide. But the mother cults did not mean social freedom for women. On thecontrary, as I will show in a discussion of Hollywood in the sequel to thisbook, cult-objects are prisoners of their own symbolic inflation. Every totemlives in taboo.Woman was an idol of belly-magic. She seemed to swell and give birth by her ownlaw. From the beginning of time, woman has seemed an uncanny being. Man honoredbut feared her. She was the black maw that had spat him forth and would devourhim anew. Men, bonding together, invented culture as a defense against femalenature. Sky-cult was the most sophisticated step in this process, for its switchof the creative locus from earth to sky is a shift from belly-magic tohead-magic. And from this defensive head-magic has come the spectacular glory ofmale civilization, which has lifted woman with it. The very language and logicmodern woman uses to assail patriarchal culture were the invention of men.Hence the sexes are caught in a comedy of historical indebtedness. Man, repelledby his debt to a physical mother, created an alternate reality, a heterocosm togive him the illusion of freedom. Woman, at first content to accept man’sprotections but now inflamed with desire for her own illusory freedom, invadesman’s systems and suppresses her indebtedness to him as she steals them. Byhead-magic she will deny there ever was a problem of sex and nature. She hasinherited the anxiety of influence.The identification of woman with nature is the most troubled and troubling termin this historical argument. Was it ever true? Can it still be true? Mostfeminist readers will disagree, but I think this identification not myth butreality. All the genres of philosophy, science, high art, athletics, andpolitics were invented by men. But by the Promethean law of conflict andcapture, woman has a right to seize what she will and to vie with man on his ownterms. Yet there is a limit to what she can alter in herself and in man’srelation to her. Every human being must wrestle with nature. But nature’s burdenfalls more heavily on one sex. With luck, this will not limit woman’sachievement, that is, her action in male-created social space. But it must limiteroticism, that is, our imaginative lives in sexual space, which may overlapsocial space but is not identical with it.Nature’s cycles are woman’s cycles. Biologic femaleness is a sequence ofcircular returns, beginning and ending at the same point. Woman’s centralitygives her a stability of identity. She does not have to become but only to be.Her centrality is a great obstacle to man, whose quest for identity she blocks.He must transform himself into an independent being, that is, a being free ofher. If he does not, he will simply fall back into her. Reunion with the motheris a siren call haunting our imagination. Once there was bliss, and now there isstruggle. Dim memories of life before the traumatic separation of birth may bethe source of Arcadian fantasies of a lost golden age. The western idea ofhistory as a propulsive movement into the future, a progressive or Providentialdesign climaxing in the revelation of a Second Coming, is a male formulation. Nowoman, I submit, could have coined such an idea, since it is a strategy ofevasion of woman’s own cyclic nature, in which man dreads being caught.Evolutionary or apocalyptic history is a male wish list with a happy ending, aphallic peak.Woman does not dream of transcendental or historical escape from natural cycle,since she is that cycle. Her sexual maturity means marriage to the moon, waxingand waning in lunar phases. Moon, month, menses: same word, same world. Theancients knew that woman is bound to nature’s calendar, an appointment shecannot refuse. The Greek pattern of free will to hybris to tragedy is a maledrama, since woman has never been deluded (until recently) by the mirage of freewill. She knows there is no free will, since she is not free. She has no choicebut acceptance. Whether she desires motherhood or not, nature yokes her into thebrute inflexible rhythm of procreative law. Menstrual cycle is an alarming clockthat cannot be stopped until nature wills it.Woman’s reproductive apparatus is vastly more complicated than man’s, and stillill-understood. All kinds of things can go wrong or cause distress in goingright. Western woman is in an agonistic relation to her own body: for her,biologic normalcy is suffering, and health an illness. Dysmenorrhea, it isargued, is a disease of civilization, since women in tribal cultures have fewmenstrual complaints. But in tribal life, woman has an extended or collectiveidentity; tribal religion honors nature and subordinates itself to it. It isprecisely in advanced western society, which attempts to improve or surpassnature and which holds up individualism and self-realization as a model, thatthe stark facts of woman’s condition emerge with painful clarity. The more womanaims for personal identity and autonomy, the more she develops her imagination,the fiercer will be her struggle with nature—that is, with the intractablephysical laws of her own body. And the more nature will punish her: do not dareto be free! for your body does not belong to you.The female body is a chthonian machine, indifferent to the spirit who inhabitsit. Organically, it has one mission, pregnancy, which we may spend a lifetimestaving off. Nature cares only for species, never individuals: the humiliatingdimensions of this biologic fact are most directly experienced by women, whoprobably have a greater realism and wisdom than men because of it. Woman’s bodyis a sea acted upon by the month’s lunar wave-motion. Sluggish and dormant, herfatty tissues are gorged with water, then suddenly cleansed at hormonal hightide. Edema is our mammalian relapse into the vegetable. Pregnancy demonstratesthe deterministic character of woman’s sexuality. Every pregnant woman has bodyand self taken over by a chthonian force beyond her control. In the welcomepregnancy, this is a happy sacrifice. But in the unwanted one, initiated by rapeor misadventure, it is a horror. Such unfortunate women look directly intonature’s heart of darkness. For a fetus is a benign tumor, a vampire who stealsin order to live. The so-called miracle of birth is nature getting her own way.Every month for women is a new defeat of the will. Menstruation was once called“the curse,” a reference to the expulsion from the Garden, when woman wascondemned to labor pains because of Eve’s sin. Most early cultures hemmed inmenstruating women by ritual taboos. Orthodox Jewish women still purifythemselves from menstrual uncleanness in the mikveh, a ritual bath. Women haveborne the symbolic burden of man’s imperfections, his grounding in nature.Menstrual blood is the stain, the birthmark of original sin, the filth thattranscendental religion must wash from man. Is this identification merelyphobic, merely misogynistic? Or is it possible there is something uncanny aboutmenstrual blood, justifying its attachment to taboo? I will argue that it is notmenstrual blood per se which disturbs the imagination—unstanchable as that redflood may be—but rather the albumen in the blood, the uterine shreds, placentaljellyfish of the female sea. This is the chthonian matrix from which we rose. Wehave an evolutionary revulsion from slime, our site of biologic origins. Everymonth, it is woman’s fate to face the abyss of time and being, the abyss whichis herself.The Bible has come under fire for making woman the fall guy in man’s cosmicdrama. But in casting a male conspirator, the serpent, as God’s enemy, Genesishedges and does not take its misogyny far enough. The Bible defensively swervesfrom God’s true opponent, chthonian nature. The serpent is not outside Eve butin her. She is the garden and the serpent. Anthony Storr says of witches, “At avery primitive level, all mothers are phallic.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch01note2a]The Devil is a woman. Modern emancipation movements, discarding stereotypesimpeding woman’s social advance, refuse to acknowledge procreation’s daemonism.Nature is serpentine, a bed of tangled vines, creepers and crawlers, probingdumb fingers of fetid organic life which Wordsworth taught us to call pretty.Biologists speak of man’s reptilian brain, the oldest part of our upper nervoussystem, killer survivor of the archaic era. I contend that the premenstrualwoman incited to snappishness or rage is hearing signals from the reptilianbrain. In her, man’s latent perversity is manifest. All hell breaks loose, thehell of chthonian nature that modern humanism denies and represses. In everypremenstrual woman struggling to govern her temper, sky-cult wars again withearth-cult.Mythology’s identification of woman with nature is correct. The malecontribution to procreation is momentary and transient. Conception is a pinpointof time, another of our phallic peaks of action, from which the male slides backuselessly. The pregnant woman is daemonically, devilishly complete. As anontological entity, she needs nothing and no one. I shall maintain that thepregnant woman, brooding for nine months upon her own creation, is the patternof all solipsism, that the historical attribution of narcissism to women isanother true myth. Male bonding and patriarchy were the recourse to which manwas forced by his terrible sense of woman’s power, her imperviousness, herarchetypal confederacy with chthonian nature. Woman’s body is a labyrinth inwhich man is lost. It is a walled garden, the medieval hortus conclusus, inwhich nature works its daemonic sorcery. Woman is the primeval fabricator, thereal First Mover. She turns a gob of refuse into a spreading web of sentientbeing, floating on the snaky umbilical by which she leashes every man.Feminism has been simplistic in arguing that female archetypes were politicallymotivated falsehoods by men. The historical repugnance to woman has a rationalbasis: disgust is reason’s proper response to the grossness of procreativenature. Reason and logic are the anxiety-inspired domain of Apollo, premiere godof sky-cult. The Apollonian is harsh and phobic, coldly cutting itself off fromnature by its superhuman purity. I shall argue that western personality andwestern achievement are, for better or worse, largely Apollonian. Apollo’s greatopponent Dionysus is ruler of the chthonian whose law is procreative femaleness.As we shall see, the Dionysian is liquid nature, a miasmic swamp whose prototypeis the still pond of the womb.We must ask whether the equivalence of male and female in Far Eastern symbolismwas as culturally efficacious as the hierarchization of male over female hasbeen in the west. Which system has ultimately benefited women more? Westernscience and industry have freed women from drudgery and danger. Machines dohousework. The pill neutralizes fertility. Giving birth is no longer fatal. Andthe Apollonian line of western rationality has produced the modern aggressivewoman who can think like a man and write obnoxious books. The tension andantagonism in western metaphysics developed human higher cortical powers togreat heights. Most of western culture is a distortion of reality. But realityshould be distorted; that is, imaginatively amended. The Buddhist acquiescenceto nature is neither accurate about nature nor just to human potential. TheApollonian has taken us to the stars.Daemonic archetypes of woman, filling world mythology, represent theuncontrollable nearness of nature. Their tradition passes nearly unbroken fromprehistoric idols through literature and art to modern movies. The primary imageis the femme fatale, the woman fatal to man. The more nature is beaten back inthe west, the more the femme fatale reappears, as a return of the repressed. Sheis the spectre of the west’s bad conscience about nature. She is the moralambiguity of nature, a malevolent moon that keeps breaking through our fog ofhopeful sentiment.Feminism dismisses the femme fatale as a cartoon and libel. If she ever existed,she was simply a victim of society, resorting to destructive womanly wilesbecause of her lack of access to political power. The femme fatale was a careerwoman manquée, her energies neurotically diverted into the boudoir. By suchtechniques of demystification, feminism has painted itself into a corner.Sexuality is a murky realm of contradiction and ambivalence. It cannot always beunderstood by social models, which feminism, as an heir of nineteenth-centuryutilitarianism, insists on imposing on it. Mystification will always remain thedisorderly companion of love and art. Eroticism is mystique; that is, the auraof emotion and imagination around sex. It cannot be “fixed” by codes of socialor moral convenience, whether from the political left or right. For nature’sfascism is greater than that of any society. There is a daemonic instability insexual relations that we may have to accept.The femme fatale is one of the most mesmerizing of sexual personae. She is not afiction but an extrapolation of biologic realities in women that remainconstant. The North American Indian myth of the toothed vagina (vagina dentata)is a gruesomely direct transcription of female power and male fear.Metaphorically, every vagina has secret teeth, for the male exits as less thanwhen he entered. The basic mechanics of conception require action in the malebut nothing more than passive receptivity in the female. Sex as a natural ratherthan social transaction, therefore, really is a kind of drain of male energy byfemale fullness. Physical and spiritual castration is the danger every man runsin intercourse with a woman. Love is the spell by which he puts his sexual fearto sleep. Woman’s latent vampirism is not a social aberration but a developmentof her maternal function, for which nature has equipped her with tiresomethoroughness. For the male, every act of intercourse is a return to the motherand a capitulation to her. For men, sex is a struggle for identity. In sex, themale is consumed and released again by the toothed power that bore him, thefemale dragon of nature.The femme fatale was produced by the mystique of connection between mother andchild. A modern assumption is that sex and procreation are medically,scientifically, intellectually “manageable.” If we keep tinkering with thesocial mechanism long enough, every difficulty will disappear. Meanwhile, thedivorce rate soars. Conventional marriage, despite its inequities, kept thechaos of libido in check. When the prestige of marriage is low, all the nastydaemonism of sexual instinct pops out. Individualism, the self unconstrained bysociety, leads to the coarser servitude of constraint by nature. Every road fromRousseau leads to Sade. The mystique of our birth from human mothers is one ofthe daemonic clouds we cannot dispel by tiny declarations of independence.Apollo can swerve from nature, but he cannot obliterate it. As emotional andsexual beings we go full circle. Old age is a second childhood in which earliestmemories revive. Chillingly, comatose patients of any age automatically drifttoward the fetal position, from which they have to be pried by nurses. We aretied to our birth by unshakable apparitions of sense-memory.Rousseauist psychologies like feminism assert the ultimate benevolence of humanemotion. In such a system, the femme fatale logically has no place. I followFreud, Nietzsche, and Sade in my view of the amorality of the instinctual life.At some level, all love is combat, a wrestling with ghosts. We are only forsomething by being against something else. People who believe they are havingpleasant, casual, uncomplex sexual encounters, whether with friend, spouse, orstranger, are blocking from consciousness the tangle of psychodynamics at work,just as they block the hostile clashings of their dream life. Family romanceoperates at all times. The femme fatale is one of the refinements of femalenarcissism, of the ambivalent self-directedness that is completed by the birthof a child or by the conversion of spouse or lover into child.Mothers can be fatal to their sons. It is against the mother that men haveerected their towering edifice of politics and sky-cult. She is Medusa, in whomFreud sees the castrating and castrated female pubes. But Medusa’s snaky hair isalso the writhing vegetable growth of nature. Her hideous grimace is men’s fearof the laughter of women. She that gives life also blocks the way to freedom.Therefore I agree with Sade that we have the right to thwart nature’sprocreative compulsions, through sodomy or abortion. Male homosexuality may bethe most valorous of attempts to evade the femme fatale and to defeat nature. Byturning away from the Medusan mother, whether in honor or detestation of her,the male homosexual is one of the great forgers of absolutist western identity.But of course nature has won, as she always does, by making disease the price ofpromiscuous sex.The permanence of the femme fatale as a sexual persona is part of the wearyweight of eroticism, beneath which both ethics and religion founder. Eroticismis society’s soft point, through which it is invaded by chthonian nature. Thefemme fatale can appear as Medusan mother or as frigid nymph, masquing in thebrilliant luminosity of Apollonian high glamour. Her cool unreachabilitybeckons, fascinates, and destroys. She is not a neurotic but, if anything, apsychopath. That is, she has an amoral affectlessness, a serene indifference tothe suffering of others, which she invites and dispassionately observes as testsof her power. The mystique of the femme fatale cannot be perfectly translatedinto male terms. I will speak at length of the beautiful boy, one of the west’smost stunning sexual personae. However, the danger of the homme fatal, asembodied in today’s boyish male hustler, is that he will leave, disappearing toother loves, other lands. He is a rambler, a cowboy and sailor. But the dangerof the femme fatale is that she will stay, still, placid, and paralyzing. Herremaining is a daemonic burden, the ubiquity of Walter Pater’s Mona Lisa, whosmothers history. She is a thorny symbol of the perversity of sex. She willstick.We are moving in this chapter toward a theory of beauty. I believe that theaesthetic sense, like everything else thus far, is a swerve from the chthonian.It is a displacement from one area of reality to another, analogous to the shiftfrom earth-cult to sky-cult. Ferenczi speaks of the replacement of animal noseby human eye, because of our upright stance. The eye is peremptory in itsjudgments. It decides what to see and why. Each of our glances is as muchexclusion as inclusion. We select, editorialize, and enhance. Our idea of thepretty is a limited notion that cannot possibly apply to earth’s metamorphicunderworld, a cataclysmic realm of chthonian violence. We choose not to see thisviolence on our daily strolls. Every time we say nature is beautiful, we aresaying a prayer, fingering our worry beads.The cool beauty of the femme fatale is another transformation of chthonianugliness. Female animals are usually less beautiful than males. The motherbird’s dull feathers are camouflage, protecting the nest from predators. Malebirds are creatures of spectacular display, of both plumage and parade, partlyto impress females and conquer rivals and partly to divert enemies from thenest. Among humans, male ritual display is just as extreme, but for the firsttime the female becomes a lavishly beautiful object. Why? The female is adornednot simply to increase her property value, as Marxism would demystifyingly haveit, but to assure her desirability. Consciousness has made cowards of us all.Animals do not feel sexual fear, because they are not rational beings. Theyoperate under a pure biologic imperative. Mind, which has enabled humanity toadapt and flourish as a species, has also infinitely complicated our functioningas physical beings. We see too much, and so have to stringently limit ourseeing. Desire is besieged on all sides by anxiety and doubt. Beauty, an ecstasyof the eye, drugs us and allows us to act. Beauty is our Apollonian revision ofthe chthonian.Nature is a Darwinian spectacle of the eaters and the eaten. All phases ofprocreation are ruled by appetite: sexual intercourse, from kissing topenetration, consists of movements of barely controlled cruelty and consumption.The long pregnancy of the human female and the protracted childhood of herinfant, who is not self-sustaining for seven years or more, have produced theagon of psychological dependency that burdens the male for a lifetime. Manjustifiably fears being devoured by woman, who is nature’s proxy.Repression is an evolutionary adaptation permitting us to function under theburden of our expanded consciousness. For what we are conscious of could driveus mad. Crude male slang speaks of female genitalia as “slash” or “gash.” Freudnotes that Medusa turns men to stone because, at first sight, a boy thinksfemale genitals a wound, from which the penis has been cut. They are indeed awound, but it is the infant who has been cut away, by violence: the umbilical isa hawser sawed through by a social rescue party. Sexual necessity drives manback to that bloody scene, but he cannot approach it without tremors ofapprehension. These he conceals by euphemisms of love and beauty. However, theless well-bred he is—that is, the less socialized—the sharper his sense of theanimality of sex and the grosser his language. The foulmouthed roughneck isproduced not by society’s sexism but by society’s absence. For nature is themost foulmouthed of us all.Woman’s current advance in society is not a voyage from myth to truth but frommyth to new myth. The rise of rational, technological woman may demand therepression of unpleasant archetypal realities. Ferenczi remarks, “The periodicpulsations in feminine sexuality (puberty, the menses, pregnancies andparturitions, the climacterium) require a much more powerful repression on thewoman’s part than is necessary for the man.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch01note3a] Inits argument with male society, feminism must suppress the monthly evidence ofwoman’s domination by chthonian nature. Menstruation and childbirth are anaffront to beauty and form. In aesthetic terms, they are spectacles of frightfulsqualor. Modern life, with its hospitals and paper products, has distanced andsanitized these primitive mysteries, just as it has done with death, which usedto be a gruelling at-home affair. An awful lot is being swept under the rug: theawe and terror that is our lot.The woundlike rawness of female genitals is a symbol of the unredeemability ofchthonian nature. In aesthetic terms, female genitals are lurid in color,vagrant in contour, and architecturally incoherent. Male genitals, on the otherhand, though they risk ludicrousness by their rubbery indecisiveness (a SylviaPlath heroine memorably thinks of “turkey neck and turkey gizzards”), have arational mathematical design, a syntax. This is no absolute virtue, however,since it may tend to confirm the male in his abundant misperceptions of reality.Aesthetics stop where sex begins. G. Wilson Knight declares, “All physical loveis, in its way, a victory over physical secrecies and physical repulsions.”4[ch25_notes.html#ch01note4a] Sex is sloppy and untidy, a return to what Freudcalls the infant’s polymorphous perversity, a zestful rolling around in everybody fluid. St. Augustine says, “We are born between feces and urine.” Thismisogynistic view of the infant’s sin-stained emergence from the birth canal isclose to the chthonian truth. But excretion, through which nature for once actsupon the sexes equally, can be saved by comedy, as we see in Aristophanes,Rabelais, Pope, and Joyce. Excretion has found a place in high culture.Menstruation and childbirth are too barbaric for comedy. Their ugliness hasproduced the giant displacement of women’s historical status as sex object,whose beauty is endlessly discussed and modified. Woman’s beauty is a compromisewith her dangerous archetypal allure. It gives the eye the comforting illusionof intellectual control over nature.My explanation for the male domination of art, science, and politics, anindisputable fact of history, is based on an analogy between sexual physiologyand aesthetics. I will argue that all cultural achievement is a projection, aswerve into Apollonian transcendance, and that men are anatomically destined tobe projectors. But as with Oedipus, destiny may be a curse.How we know the world and how it knows us are underlain by shadow patterns ofsexual biography and sexual geography. What breaks into consciousness is shapedin advance by the daemonism of the senses. Mind is a captive of the body.Perfect objectivity does not exist. Every thought bears some emotional burden.Had we time or energy to pursue it, each random choice, from the color of atoothbrush to a decision over a menu, could be made to yield its secret meaningin the inner drama of our lives. But in exhaustion, we shut out this psychicsupersaturation. The realm of number, the crystalline mathematic of Apollonianpurity, was invented early on by western man as a refuge from the soggyemotionalism and bristling disorder of woman and nature. Women who excel inmathematics do so in a system devised by men for the mastery of nature. Numberis the most imposing and least creaturely of pacifiers, man’s yearning hope forobjectivity. It is to number that he—and now she—withdraws to escape from thechthonian mire of love, hate, and family romance.Even now, it is usually men rather than women who claim logic’s superiority toemotion. This they comically tend to do at moments of maximum emotional chaos,which they may have incited and are helpless to stem. Male artists and actorshave a cultural function in keeping the line of emotion open from the female tomale realms. Every man harbors an inner female territory ruled by his mother,from whom he can never entirely break free. Since Romanticism, art and the studyof art have become vehicles for exploring the west’s repressed emotional life,though one would never know it from half the deadening scholarship that hassprung up around them. Poetry is the connecting link between body and mind.Every idea in poetry is grounded in emotion. Every word is a palpation of thebody. The multiplicity of interpretation surrounding a poem mirrors the stormyuncontrollability of emotion, where nature works her will. Emotion is chaos.Every benign emotion has a flip side of negativity. Thus the flight from emotionto number is another crucial strategy of the Apollonian west in its longstruggle with Dionysus.Emotion is passion, a continuum of eroticism and aggression. Love and hate arenot opposites: there is only more passion and less passion, a difference ofquantity and not of kind. To live in love and peace is one of the outstandingcontradictions that Christianity has imposed on its followers, an idealimpossible and unnatural. Since Romanticism, artists and intellectuals havecomplained about the church’s sex rules, but these are just one small part ofthe Christian war with pagan nature. Only a saint could sustain the Christiancode of love. And saints are ruthless in their exclusions: they must shut out anenormous amount of reality, the reality of sexual personae and the reality ofnature. Love for all means coldness to something or someone. Even Jesus, let usrecall, was unnecessarily rude to his mother at Cana.The chthonian superflux of emotion is a male problem. A man must do battle withthat enormity, which resides in woman and nature. He can attain selfhood only bybeating back the daemonic cloud that would swallow him up: mother-love, which wemay just as well call mother-hate. Mother-love, mother-hate, for her or fromher, one huge conglomerate of natural power. Political equality for women willmake very little difference in this emotional turmoil that is going on above andbelow politics, outside the scheme of social life. Not until all babies are bornfrom glass jars will the combat cease between mother and son. But in atotalitarian future that has removed procreation from woman’s hands, there willalso be no affect and no art. Men will be machines, without pain but alsowithout pleasure. Imagination has a price, which we are paying every day. Thereis no escape from the biologic chains that bind us.What has nature given man to defend himself against woman? Here we come to thesource of man’s cultural achievements, which follow so directly from hissingular anatomy. Our lives as physical beings give rise to basic metaphors ofapprehension, which vary greatly between the sexes. Here there can be noequality. Man is sexually compartmentalized. Genitally, he is condemned to aperpetual pattern of linearity, focus, aim, directedness. He must learn to aim.Without aim, urination and ejaculation end in infantile soiling of self orsurroundings. Woman’s eroticism is diffused throughout her body. Her desire forforeplay remains a notorious area of miscommunication between the sexes. Man’sgenital concentration is a reduction but also an intensification. He is a victimof unruly ups and downs. Male sexuality is inherently manic-depressive. Estrogentranquilizes, but androgen agitates. Men are in a constant state of sexualanxiety, living on the pins and needles of their hormones. In sex as in lifethey are driven beyond—beyond the self, beyond the body. Even in the womb thisrule applies. Every fetus becomes female unless it is steeped in male hormone,produced by a signal from the testes. Before birth, therefore, a male is alreadybeyond the female. But to be beyond is to be exiled from the center of life. Menknow they are sexual exiles. They wander the earth seeking satisfaction, cravingand despising, never content. There is nothing in that anguished motion forwomen to envy.The male genital metaphor is concentration and projection. Nature givesconcentration to man to help him overcome his fear. Man approaches woman inbursts of spasmodic concentration. This gives him the delusion of temporarycontrol of the archetypal mysteries that brought him forth. It gives him thecourage to return. Sex is metaphysical for men, as it is not for women. Womenhave no problem to solve by sex. Physically and psychologically, they areserenely self-contained. They may choose to achieve, but they do not need it.They are not thrust into the beyond by their own fractious bodies. But men areout of balance. They must quest, pursue, court, or seize. Pigeons on the grass,alas: in such parkside rituals we may savor the comic pathos of sex. How oftenone spots a male pigeon making desperate, self-inflating sallies toward thefemale, as again and again she turns her back on him and nonchalantly marchesaway. But by concentration and insistence he may carry the day. Nature hasblessed him with obliviousness to his own absurdity. His purposiveness is both agift and a burden. In human beings, sexual concentration is the male’sinstrument for gathering together and forcibly fixing the dangerous chthoniansuperflux of emotion and energy that I identify with woman and nature. In sex,man is driven into the very abyss which he flees. He makes a voyage to nonbeingand back.Through concentration to projection into the beyond. The male projection oferection and ejaculation is the paradigm for all cultural projection andconceptualization—from art and philosophy to fantasy, hallucination, andobsession. Women have conceptualized less in history not because men have keptthem from doing so but because women do not need to conceptualize in order toexist. I leave open the question of brain differences. Conceptualization andsexual mania may issue from the same part of the male brain. Fetishism, forinstance, a practice which like most of the sex perversions is confined to men,is clearly a conceptualizing or symbol-making activity. Man’s vastly greatercommercial patronage of pornography is analogous.An erection is a thought and the orgasm an act of imagination. The male has towill his sexual authority before the woman who is a shadow of his mother and ofall women. Failure and humiliation constantly wait in the wings. No woman has toprove herself a woman in the grim way a man has to prove himself a man. He mustperform, or the show does not go on. Social convention is irrelevant. A flop isa flop. Ironically, sexual success always ends in sagging fortunes anyhow. Everymale projection is transient and must be anxiously, endlessly renewed. Men enterin triumph but withdraw in decrepitude. The sex act cruelly mimics history’sdecline and fall. Male bonding is a self-preservation society, collegialreaffirmation through larger, fabricated frames of reference. Culture is man’siron reinforcement of his ever-imperiled private projections.Concentration and projection are remarkably demonstrated by urination, one ofmale anatomy’s most efficient compartmentalizations. Freud thinks primitive manpreened himself on his ability to put out a fire with a stream of urine. Astrange thing to be proud of but certainly beyond the scope of woman, who wouldscorch her hams in the process. Male urination really is a kind ofaccomplishment, an arc of transcendance. A woman merely waters the ground shestands on. Male urination is a form of commentary. It can be friendly whenshared but is often aggressive, as in the defacement of public monuments bySixties rock stars. To piss on is to criticize. John Wayne urinated on the shoesof a grouchy director in full view of cast and crew. This is one genre ofself-expression women will never master. A male dog marking every bush on theblock is a graffiti artist, leaving his rude signature with each lift of theleg. Women, like female dogs, are earthbound squatters. There is no projectionbeyond the boundaries of the self. Space is claimed by being sat on, squatter’srights.The cumbersome, solipsistic character of female physiology is tediously evidentat sports events and rock concerts, where fifty women wait in line for admissionto the sequestered cells of the toilet. Meanwhile, their male friends zip in andout (in every sense) and stand around looking at their watches and rolling theireyes. Freud’s notion of penis envy proves too true when the pubcrawling malecheerily relieves himself in midnight alleyways, to the vexation of his burstingfemale companions. This compartmentalization or isolation of male genitality hasits dark side, however. It can lead to a dissociation of sex and emotion, totemptation, promiscuity, and disease. The modern male homosexual, for example,has sought ecstasy in the squalor of public toilets, for women perhaps the leasterotic place on earth.Man’s metaphors of concentration and projection are echoes of both body andmind. Without them, he would be helpless before woman’s power. Without them,woman would long ago have absorbed all of creation into herself. There would beno culture, no system, no pyramiding of one hierarchy upon another. Earth-cultmust lose to sky-cult, if mind is ever to break free from matter. Ironically,the more modern woman thinks with Apollonian clarity, the more she participatesin the historical negation of her sex. Political equality for women, desirableand necessary as it is, is not going to remedy the radical disjunction betweenthe sexes that begins and ends in the body. The sexes will always be jolted byviolent shocks of attraction and repulsion.Androgyny, which some feminists promote as a pacifist blueprint for sexualutopia, belongs to the contemplative rather than active life. It is the ancientprerogative of priests, shamans, and artists. Feminists have politicized it as aweapon against the masculine principle. Redefined, it now means men must be likewomen and women can be whatever they like. Androgyny is a cancellation of maleconcentration and projection. Prescriptions for the future by bourgeoisacademics and writers carry their own bias. The reform of a college Englishdepartment cuts no ice down at the corner garage. Male concentration andprojection are visible everywhere in the aggressive energy of the streets.Fortunately, male homosexuals of every social class have preserved the cult ofthe masculine, which will therefore never lose its aesthetic legitimacy. Majorpeaks of western culture have been accompanied by a high incidence of malehomosexuality—in classical Athens and Renaissance Florence and London. Maleconcentration and projection are self-enhancing, leading to supreme achievementsof Apollonian conceptualization.If sexual physiology provides the pattern for our experience of the world, whatis woman’s basic metaphor? It is mystery, the hidden. Karen Horney speaks of agirl’s inability to see her genitals and a boy’s ability to see his as thesource of “the greater subjectivity of women as compared with the greaterobjectivity of men.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch01note5a] To rephrase this with mydifferent emphasis: men’s delusional certitude that objectivity is possible isbased on the visibility of their genitals. Second, this certitude is a defensiveswerve from the anxiety-inducing invisibility of the womb. Women tend to be morerealistic and less obsessional because of their toleration for ambiguity, whichthey learn from their inability to learn about their own bodies. Women acceptlimited knowledge as their natural condition, a great human truth that a man maytake a lifetime to reach.The female body’s unbearable hiddenness applies to all aspects of men’s dealingswith women. What does it look like in there? Did she have an orgasm? Is itreally my child? Who was my real father? Mystery shrouds woman’s sexuality. Thismystery is the main reason for the imprisonment man has imposed on women. Onlyby confining his wife in a locked harem guarded by eunuchs could he be certainthat her son was also his. Man’s genital visibility is a source of hisscientific desire for external testing, validation, proof. By this method hehopes to solve the ultimate mystery story, his chthonian birth. Woman is veiled.Violent tearing of this veil may be a motive in gang-rapes and rape-murders,particularly ritualistic disembowellings of the Jack the Ripper kind. TheRipper’s public nailing up of his victim’s uterus is exactly paralleled intribal ritual of South African Bushmen. Sex crimes are always male, neverfemale, because such crimes are conceptualizing assaults on the unreachableomnipotence of woman and nature. Every woman’s body contains a cell of archaicnight, where all knowing must stop. This is the profound meaning behindstriptease, a sacred dance of pagan origins which, like prostitution,Christianity has never been able to stamp out. Erotic dancing by males cannot becomparable, for a nude woman carries off the stage a final concealment, thatchthonian darkness from which we come.Woman’s body is a secret, sacred space. It is a temenos or ritual precinct, aGreek word I adopt for the discussion of art. In the marked-off space of woman’sbody, nature operates at its darkest and most mechanical. Every woman is apriestess guarding the temenos of daemonic mysteries. Virginity is categoricallydifferent for the sexes. A boy becoming a man quests for experience. The penisis like eye or hand, an extension of self reaching outward. But a girl is asealed vessel that must be broken into by force. The female body is theprototype of all sacred spaces from cave shrine to temple and church. The wombis the veiled Holy of Holies, a great problem, as we shall see, for sexualpolemicists like William Blake who seek to abolish guilt and covertness in sex.The taboo on woman’s body is the taboo that always hovers over the place ofmagic. Woman is literally the occult, which means “the hidden.” These uncannymeanings cannot be changed, only suppressed, until they break into culturalconsciousness again. Political equality will succeed only in political terms. Itis helpless against the archetypal. Kill the imagination, lobotomize the brain,castrate and operate: then the sexes will be the same. Until then, we must liveand dream in the daemonic turbulence of nature.Everything sacred and inviolable provokes profanation and violation. Every crimethat can be committed will be. Rape is a mode of natural aggression that can becontrolled only by the social contract. Modern feminism’s most naive formulationis its assertion that rape is a crime of violence but not of sex, that it ismerely power masquerading as sex. But sex is power, and all power is inherentlyaggressive. Rape is male power fighting female power. It is no more to beexcused than is murder or any other assault on another’s civil rights. Societyis woman’s protection against rape, not, as some feminists absurdly maintain,the cause of rape. Rape is the sexual expression of the will-to-power, whichnature plants in all of us and which civilization rose to contain. Therefore therapist is a man with too little socialization rather than too much. Worldwideevidence is overwhelming that whenever social controls are weakened, as in waror mob rule, even civilized men behave in uncivilized ways, among which is thebarbarity of rape.The latent metaphors of the body guarantee the survival of rape, which is adevelopment in degree of intensity alone of the basic movements of sex. A girl’sloss of virginity is always in some sense a violation of sanctity, an invasionof her integrity and identity. Defloration is destruction. But nature creates byviolence and destruction. The commonest violence in the world is childbirth,with its appalling pain and gore. Nature gives males infusions of hormones fordominance in order to hurl them against the paralyzing mystery of woman, fromwhom they would otherwise shrink. Her power as mistress of birth is already tooextreme. Lust and aggression are fused in male hormones. Anyone who doubts thishas probably never spent much time around horses. Stallions are so dangerousthey must be caged in barred stalls; once gelded, they are docile enough toserve as children’s mounts. The hormonal disparity in humans is not so gross,but it is grosser than Rousseauists like to think. The more testosterone, themore elevated the libido. The more dominant the male, the more frequent hiscontributions to the genetic pool. Even on the microscopic level, male fertilityis a function not only of number of sperm but of their motility, that is, theirrestless movement, which increases the chance of conception. Sperm are miniatureassault troops, and the ovum is a solitary citadel that must be breached. Weakor passive sperm just sit there like dead ducks. Nature rewards energy andaggression.Profanation and violation are part of the perversity of sex, which never willconform to liberal theories of benevolence. Every model of morally orpolitically correct sexual behavior will be subverted, by nature’s daemonic law.Every hour of every day, some horror is being committed somewhere. Feminism,arguing from the milder woman’s view, completely misses the blood-lust in rape,the joy of violation and destruction. An aesthetics and erotics ofprofanation—evil for the sake of evil, the sharpening of the senses by crueltyand torture—have been documented in Sade, Baudelaire, and Huysmans. Women may beless prone to such fantasies because they physically lack the equipment forsexual violence. They do not know the temptation of forcibly invading thesanctuary of another body.Our knowledge of these fantasies is expanded by pornography, which is whypornography should be tolerated, though its public display may reasonably berestricted. The imagination cannot and must not be policed. Pornography shows usnature’s daemonic heart, those eternal forces at work beneath and beyond socialconvention. Pornography cannot be separated from art; the two interpenetrateeach other, far more than humanistic criticism has admitted. Geoffrey Hartmanrightly says, “Great art is always flanked by its dark sisters, blasphemy andpornography.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch01note6a] Hamlet itself, the cardinal westernwork, is full of lewdness. Criminals through history, from Nero and Caligula toGilles de Rais and the Nazi commandants, have never needed pornography tostimulate their exquisite, gruesome inventiveness. The diabolic human mind isquite enough.Happy are those periods when marriage and religion are strong. System and ordershelter us against sex and nature. Unfortunately, we live in a time when thechaos of sex has broken into the open. G. Wilson Knight remarks, “Christianitycame originally as a tearing down of taboos in the name of a sacred humanity;but the Church it gave rise to has never yet succeeded in Christianizing thepagan evil magic of sex.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch01note7a] Historiography’s mostglaring error has been its assertion that Judeo-Christianity defeated paganism.Paganism has survived in the thousand forms of sex, art, and now the modernmedia. Christianity has made adjustment after adjustment, ingeniously absorbingits opposition (as during the Italian Renaissance) and diluting its dogma tochange with changing times. But a critical point has been reached. With therebirth of the gods in the massive idolatries of popular culture, with theeruption of sex and violence into every corner of the ubiquitous mass media,Judeo-Christianity is facing its most serious challenge since Europe’sconfrontation with Islam in the Middle Ages. The latent paganism of westernculture has burst forth again in all its daemonic vitality.Paganism never was the unbridled sexual licentiousness portrayed by missionariesof the young, embattled Christianity. Singling out as typical of paganism theorgies of bored late Roman aristocrats would be as unfair as singling out astypical of Christianity the sins of renegade priests or the Vatican revels ofPope Alexander VI. True orgy was a ceremony of the chthonian mother-cults inwhich there were both sex and bloodshed. Paganism recognized, honored, andfeared nature’s daemonism, and it limited sexual expression by ritual formulae.Christianity was a development of Dionysian mystery religion which paradoxicallytried to suppress nature in favor of a transcendental other world. The solecontact with nature that Christianity permitted its followers was sex sanctifiedby marriage. Chthonian nature, embodied in great goddess figures, wasChristianity’s most formidable opponent. Christianity works best when reveredinstitutions like monasticism or universal marriage channel sexual energy inpositive directions. Western civilization has profited enormously from thesublimation Christianity forced on sex. Christianity works least when sex isconstantly stimulated from other directions, as it is now. No transcendentalreligion can compete with the spectacular pagan nearness and concreteness of thecarnal-red media. Our eyes and ears are drowned in a sensual torrent.The pagan ritual identity of sex and violence is mass media’s chief check to thecomplacent Rousseauism of modern humanists. The commercial media, respondingdirectly to popular patronage, sidestep the liberal censors who have enjoyedsuch long control over book culture. In film, popular music, and commercials, wecontemplate all the daemonic myths and sexual stereotypes of paganism thatreform movements from Christianity to feminism have never been able toeradicate. The sexes are eternally at war. There is an element of attack, ofsearch-and-destroy in male sex, in which there will always be a potential forrape. There is an element of entrapment in female sex, a subliminal manipulationleading to physical and emotional infantilization of the male. Freud notes,apropos of his theory of the primal scene, that a child overhearing his parentshaving sex thinks male is wounding female and that the woman’s cries of pleasureare cries of pain. Most men merely grunt, at best. But woman’s strange sexualcries come directly from the chthonian. She is a Maenad about to rend hervictim. Sex is an uncanny moment of ritual and incantation, in which we hearwoman’s barbaric ululation of triumph of the will. One domination dissolves intoanother. The dominated becomes the dominator.Every menstruating or childbearing woman is a pagan and primitive cast back tothose distant ocean shores from which we have never fully evolved. On thestreets of every city, prostitutes, the world’s oldest profession, stand as arebuke to sexual morality. They are the daemonic face of nature, initiates ofpagan mysteries. Prostitution is not just a service industry, mopping up theoverflow of male demand, which always exceeds female supply. Prostitutiontestifies to the amoral power struggle of sex, which religion has never beenable to stop. Prostitutes, pornographers, and their patrons are marauders in theforest of archaic night.That nature acts upon the sexes differently is proved by the test case of modernmale and female homosexuality, illustrating how the sexes function separatelyoutside social convention. The result, according to statistics of sexualfrequency: male satyriasis and female nesting. The male homosexual has sex moreoften than his heterosexual counterpart; the female homosexual less often thanhers, a radical polarization of the sexes along a single continuum of sharedsexual nonconformity. Male aggression and lust are the energizing factors inculture. They are men’s tools of survival in the pagan vastness of femalenature.The old “double standard” gave men a sexual liberty denied to women. Marxistfeminists reduce the historical cult of woman’s virginity to her property value,her worth on the male marriage market. I would argue instead that there was andis a biologic basis to the double standard. The first medical reports on thedisease killing male homosexuals indicated men most at risk were those with athousand partners over their lifetime. Incredulity. Who could such people be?Why, it turned out, everyone one knew. Serious, kind, literate men, not bums orthugs. What an abyss divides the sexes! Let us abandon the pretense of sexualsameness and admit the terrible duality of gender.Male sex is quest romance, exploration and speculation. Promiscuity in men maycheapen love but sharpen thought. Promiscuity in women is illness, a leakage ofidentity. The promiscuous woman is self-contaminated and incapable of clearideas. She has ruptured the ritual integrity of her body. It is in nature’s bestinterests to goad dominant males into indiscriminate spreading of their seed.But nature also profits from female purity. Even in the liberated or lesbianwoman there is some biologic restraint whispering: keep the birth canal clean.In judiciously withholding herself, woman protects an invisible fetus. Perhapsthis is the reason for the archetypal horror (rather than socialized fear) thatmany otherwise bold women have of spiders and other rapidly crawling insects.Women hold themselves in reserve because the female body is a reservoir, avirgin patch of still, pooled water where the fetus comes to term. Male chaseand female flight are not just a social game. The double standard may be one ofnature’s organic laws.The quest romance of male sex is a war between identity and annihilation. Anerection is a hope for objectivity, for power to act as a free agent. But at theclimax of his success, woman is pulling the male back to her bosom, drinking andquelling his energy. Freud says, “Man fears that his strength will be taken fromhim by woman, dreads becoming infected with her femininity and then provinghimself a weakling.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch01note8a] Masculinity must fight offeffeminacy day by day. Woman and nature stand ever ready to reduce the male toboy and infant.The operations of sex are convulsive, from intercourse through menstruation andchildbirth: tension and distention, spasm, contraction, expulsion, relief. Thebody is wrenched in serpentine swelling and sloughing. Sex is not the pleasureprinciple but the Dionysian bondage of pleasure-pain. So much is a matter ofovercoming resistance, in the body or the beloved, that rape will always be apresent danger. Male sex is repetition-compulsion: whatever a man writes in thecommentary of his phallic projections must be rewritten again and again. Sexualman is the magician sawing the lady in half, yet the serpent head and tailalways live and rejoin. Projection is a male curse: forever to need something orsomeone to make oneself complete. This is one of the sources of art and thesecret of its historical domination by males. The artist is the closest man hascome to imitating woman’s superb self-containment. But the artist needs his art,his projection. The blocked artist, like Leonardo, suffers tortures of thedamned. The most famous painting in the world, the Mona Lisa, records woman’sself-satisfied apartness, her ambiguous mocking smile at the vanity and despairof her many sons.Everything great in western culture has come from the quarrel with nature. Thewest and not the east has seen the frightful brutality of natural process, theinsult to mind in the heavy blind rolling and milling of matter. In loss of selfwe would find not love or God but primeval squalor. This revelation hashistorically fallen upon the western male, who is pulled by tidal rhythms backto the oceanic mother. It is to his resentment of this daemonic undertow that weowe the grand constructions of our culture. Apollonianism, cold and absolute, isthe west’s sublime refusal. The Apollonian is a male line drawn against thedehumanizing magnitude of female nature.Everything is melting in nature. We think we see objects, but our eyes are slowand partial. Nature is blooming and withering in long puffy respirations, risingand falling in oceanic wave-motion. A mind that opened itself fully to naturewithout sentimental preconception would be glutted by nature’s coarsematerialism, its relentless superfluity. An apple tree laden with fruit: howpeaceful, how picturesque. But remove the rosy filter of humanism from our gazeand look again. See nature spuming and frothing, its mad spermatic bubblesendlessly spilling out and smashing in that inhuman round of waste, rot, andcarnage. From the jammed glassy cells of sea roe to the feathery spores pouredinto the air from bursting green pods, nature is a festering hornet’s nest ofaggression and overkill. This is the chthonian black magic with which we areinfected as sexual beings; this is the daemonic identity that Christianity soinadequately defines as original sin and thinks it can cleanse us of.Procreative woman is the most troublesome obstacle to Christianity’s claim tocatholicity, testified by its wishful doctrines of Immaculate Conception andVirgin Birth. The procreativeness of chthonian nature is an obstacle to all ofwestern metaphysics and to each man in his quest for identity against hismother. Nature is the seething excess of being.The most effective weapon against the flux of nature is art. Religion, ritual,and art began as one, and a religious or metaphysical element is still presentin all art. Art, no matter how minimalist, is never simply design. It is alwaysa ritualistic reordering of reality. The enterprise of art, in a stablecollective era or an unsettled individualistic one, is inspired by anxiety.Every subject localized and honored by art is endangered by its opposite. Art isa shutting in in order to shut out. Art is a ritualistic binding of theperpetual motion machine that is nature. The first artist was a tribal priestcasting a spell, fixing nature’s daemonic energy in a moment of perceptualstillness. Fixation is at the heart of art, fixation as stasis and fixation asobsession. The modern artist who merely draws a line across a page is stilltrying to tame some uncontrollable aspect of reality. Art is spellbinding. Artfixes the audience in its seat, stops the feet before a painting, fixes a bookin the hand. Contemplation is a magic act.Art is order. But order is not necessarily just, kind, or beautiful. Order maybe arbitrary, harsh, and cruel. Art has nothing to do with morality. Moralthemes may be present, but they are incidental, simply grounding an art work ina particular time and place. Before the Enlightenment, religious art washieratic and ceremonial. After the Enlightenment, art had to create its ownworld, in which a new ritual of artistic formalism replaced religiousuniversals. Eighteenth-century Augustan literature demonstrates it is the orderin morality rather than the morality in order that attracts the artist. Onlyutopian liberals could be surprised that the Nazis were art connoisseurs.Particularly in modern times, when high art has been shoved to the periphery ofculture, is it evident that art is aggressive and compulsive. The artist makesart not to save humankind but to save himself. Every benevolent remark by anartist is a fog to cover his tracks, the bloody trail of his assault againstreality and others.Art is a temenos, a sacred place. It is ritually clean, a swept floor, thethreshing floor that was the first site of theater. Whatever enters this spaceis transformed. From the bison of cave painting to Hollywood movie stars,represented beings enter a cultic other life from which they may never emerge.They are spellbound. Art is sacrificial, turning its inherent aggression againstboth artist and representation. Nietzsche says, “Almost everything we call‘higher culture’ is based on the spiritualization of cruelty.”9[ch25_notes.html#ch01note9a] Literature’s endless murders and disasters arethere for contemplative pleasure, not moral lesson. Their status as fiction,removed into a sacred precinct, intensifies our pleasure by guaranteeing thatcontemplation cannot turn into action. No lunge by a compassionate spectator canavert the cool inevitability of that hieratic ceremony, ritually replayedthrough time. The blood that is shed will always be shed. Ritual in church ortheater is amoral fixation, dispelling anxiety by formalizing and freezingemotion. The ritual of art is the cruel law of pain made pleasure.Art makes things. There are, I said, no objects in nature, only the gruellingerosion of natural force, flecking, dilapidating, grinding down, reducing allmatter to fluid, the thick primal soup from which new forms bob, gasping forlife. Dionysus was identified with liquids—blood, sap, milk, wine. The Dionysianis nature’s chthonian fluidity. Apollo, on the other hand, gives form and shape,marking off one being from another. All artifacts are Apollonian. Melting andunion are Dionysian; separation and individuation, Apollonian. Every boy wholeaves his mother to become a man is turning the Apollonian against theDionysian. Every artist who is compelled toward art, who needs to make words orpictures as others need to breathe, is using the Apollonian to defeat chthoniannature. In sex, men must mediate between Apollo and Dionysus. Sexually, womancan remain oblique, opaque, taking pleasure without tumult or conflict. Woman istémenos of her own dark mysteries. Genitally, man has a little thing that hemust keep dipping in Dionysian dissolution—a risky business! Thing-making,thing-preserving is central to male experience. Man is a fetishist. Without hisfetish, woman will just gobble him up again.Hence the male domination of art and science. Man’s focus, directedness,concentration, and projection, which I identified with urination andejaculation, are his tools of sexual survival, but they have never given him afinal victory. The anxiety in sexual experience remains as strong as ever. Thisman attempts to correct by the cult of female beauty. He is erotically fixatedon woman’s “shapeliness,” those spongy maternal fat deposits of breast, hip, andbuttock which are ironically the wateriest and least stable parts of heranatomy. Woman’s billowy body reflects the surging sea of chthonian nature. Byfocusing on the shapely, by making woman a sex-object, man has struggled to fixand stabilize nature’s dreadful flux. Objectification is conceptualization, thehighest human faculty. Turning people into sex objects is one of the specialtiesof our species. It will never disappear, since it is intertwined with theartimpulse and may be identical to it. A sex-object is ritual form imposed onnature. It is a totem of our perverse imagination.Apollonian thing-making is the main line of western civilization, extending fromancient Egypt to the present. Every attempt to repress this aspect of ourculture has ultimately been defeated. First Judaism, then Christianity turnedagainst pagan idol-making. But Christianity, with wider impact than Judaism,became the most art-laden, art-dominated religion in the world. Imaginationalways remedies the defects of religion. The hardest object of Apollonianthing-making is western personality, the glamourous, striving, separatist egothat entered literature in the Iliad but, I will show, first appeared in art inOld Kingdom Egypt.Christianity, wiping out paganism’s secular glamours, tried to make spiritualityprimary. But as an embattled sect, it ended by reinforcing the west’s absolutistego-structure. The hero of the medieval Church militant, the knight in shiningarmour, is the most perfect Apollonian thing in world history. Art books need tobe rewritten: there is a direct line from Greek and Roman sculpture throughmedieval armour to the Renaissance revival of classicism. Arms and armour arenot handicrafts but art. They carry the symbolic weight of western personality.Armour is the pagan continuity in medieval Christianity. After the Renaissancereleased the sensual, idolatrous art-making of classicism, the pagan line hascontinued in brazen force to today. The idea that the western traditioncollapsed after World War One is one of the myopic little sulks of liberalism. Iwill argue that high culture made itself obsolete through modernism’s neuroticnihilism and that popular culture is the great heir of the western past. Cinemais the supreme Apollonian genre, thing-making and thing-made, a machine of thegods.Man, the sexual conceptualizer and projector, has ruled art because art is hisApollonian response toward and away from woman. A sex object is something to aimat. The eye is Apollo’s arrow following the arc of transcendance I saw in maleurination and ejaculation. The western eye is a projectile into the beyond, thatwilderness of the male condition. By no coincidence, Europe first made firearmsfor gunpowder, which China had invented centuries earlier but found little usefor. Phallic aggression and projection are intrinsic to westernconceptualization. Arrow, eye, gun, cinema: the blazing lightbeam of the movieprojector is our modern path of Apollonian transcendance. Cinema is theculmination of the obsessive, mechanistic male drive in western culture. Themovie projector is an Apollonian straightshooter, demonstrating the link betweenaggression and art. Every pictorial framing is a ritual limitation, a barredprecinct. The rectangular movie screen is clearly patterned on thepost-Renaissance framed painting. But all conceptualization is a framing.The history of costume belongs to art history but is too often regarded as ajournalistic lady’s adjunct to scholarship. There is nothing trivial aboutfashion. Standards of beauty are conceptualizations projected by each culture.They tell us everything. Women have been the most victimized by fashion’sever-turning wheel, binding their feet or bosom to phantom commands. But fashionis not just one more political oppression to add to the feminist litany.Standards of beauty, created by men but usually consented to by women, rituallylimit women’s archetypal sexual allure. Fashion is an externalization of woman’sdaemonic invisibility, her genital mystery. It brings before man’s Apollonianeye what that eye can never see. Beauty is an Apollonian freeze-frame: it haltsand condenses the flux and indeterminacy of nature. It allows man to act byenhancing the desirability of what he fears.The power of the eye in western culture has not been fully appreciated oranalyzed. The Asian abases the eyes and transfers value into a mystic third eye,marked by the red dot on the Hindu forehead. Personality is inauthentic in theeast, which identifies self with group. Eastern meditation rejects historicaltime. We have a parallel religious tradition: the paradoxical axioms of easternand western mystics and poets are often indistinguishable. Buddhism andChristianity agree in seeing the material world as samsara, the veil ofillusion. But the west has another tradition, the pagan, culminating in cinema.The west makes personality and history numinous objects of contemplation.Western personality is a work of art, and history is its stage. The twentiethcentury is not the Age of Anxiety but the Age of Hollywood. The pagan cult ofpersonality has reawakened and dominates all art, all thought. It is morallyempty but ritually profound. We worship it by the power of the western eye.Movie screen and television screen are its sacred precincts.Western culture has a roving eye. Male sex is hunting and scanning: boys hangyelping from honking cars, acting like jerks over strolling girls; men lunchingon girders go through the primitive book of wolf whistles and animal clucks.Everywhere, the beautiful woman is scrutinized and harassed. She is the ultimatesymbol of human desire. The feminine is that-which-is-sought; it recedes beyondour grasp. Hence there is always a feminine element in the beautiful young manof male homosexuality. The feminine is the ever-elusive, a silver shimmer on thehorizon. We follow this image with longing eyes: maybe this one, maybe thistime. The pursuit of sex may conceal a dream of being freed from sex. Sex,knowledge, and power are deeply tangled; we cannot get one without the others.Islam is wise to drape women in black, for the eye is the avenue of eros.Western culture’s hard, defined personalities suffer from inflammation of theeye. They are so numerous that they have never been catalogued, except in ourmagnificent portrait art. Western sexual personae are nodes of power, but theyhave made a torment of eroticism. From this torment has come our grand traditionof literature and art. Unfortunately, there is no way to separate the whistlingass on his girder from the rapt visionary at his easel. In accepting the giftsof culture, women may have to take the worm with the apple.Judeo-Christianity has failed to control the pagan western eye. Our thoughtprocesses were formed in Greece and inherited by Rome, whose language remainsthe official voice of the Catholic church. Intellectual inquiry and logic arepagan. Every inquiry is preceded by a roving eye; and once the eye begins torove, it cannot be morally controlled. Judaism, due to its fear of the eye, puta taboo on visual representation. Judaism is based on word rather than image.Christianity followed suit, until it drifted into pictorialism to appeal to thepagan masses. Protestantism began as an iconoclasm, a breaking of the images ofthe corrupt Roman church. The pure Protestant style is a bare white church withplain windows. Italian Catholicism, I am happy to say, retains the most floridpictorialism, the bequest of a pagan past that was never lost.Paganism is eye-intense. It is based on cultic exhibitionism, in which sex andsadomasochism are joined. The ancient chthonian mysteries have never disappearedfrom the Italian church. Waxed saints’ corpses under glass. Tattered arm bonesin gold reliquaries. Half-nude St. Sebastian pierced by arrows. St. Lucy holdingher eyeballs out on a platter. Blood, torture, ecstasy, and tears. Its luridsensationalism makes Italian Catholicism the emotionally most complete cosmologyin religious history. Italy added pagan sex and violence to the asceticPalestinian creed. And so to Hollywood, the modern Rome: it is pagan sex andviolence that have flowered so vividly in our mass media. The camera has unbounddaemonic western imagination. Cinema is sexual showing, a pagan flaunting. Plotand dialogue are obsolete word-baggage. Cinema, the most eye-intense of genres,has restored pagan antiquity’s cultic exhibitionism. Spectacle is a pagan cultof the eye.There is no such thing as “mere” image. Western culture is built on perceptualrelations. From the soaring god-projections of ancient sky-cult to thecelebrity-inflating machinery of American commercial promotion, western identityhas organized itself around charismatic sexual personae of hierarchic command.Every god is an idol, literally an “image” (Latin idolum from Greek eidolon).Image is implied visibility. The visual is sorely undervalued in modernscholarship. Art history has attained only a fraction of the conceptualsophistication of literary criticism. And literature and art remain unmeshed.Drunk with self love, criticism has hugely overestimated the centrality oflanguage to western culture. It has failed to see the electrifying sign languageof images.The war between Judeo-Christianity and paganism is still being waged in thelatest ideologies of the university. Freud, as a Jew, may have been biased infavor of the word. In my opinion, Freudian theory overstates the linguisticcharacter of the unconscious and slights the gorgeously cinematic pictorialismof the dream life. Furthermore, arguments by the French about the rationalistlimitations of their own culture have been illegitimately transferred to Englandand America, with poor results. The English language was created by poets, afive-hundred-year enterprise of emotion and metaphor, the richest internaldialogue in world literature. French rhetorical models are too narrow for theEnglish tradition. Most pernicious of French imports is the notion that there isno person behind a text. Is there anything more affected, aggressive, andrelentlessly concrete than a Parisian intellectual behind his/her turgid text?The Parisian is a provincial when he pretends to speak for the universe. Behindevery book is a certain person with a certain history. I can never know too muchabout that person and that history. Personality is western reality. It is avisible condensation of sex and psyche outside the realm of word. We know it byApollonian vision, the pagan cinema of western perception. Let us not steal fromthe eye to give to the ear.Word-worship has made it difficult for scholarship to deal with the radicalcultural change of our era of mass media. Academics are constantly fighting arearguard action. Traditional genre-criticism is moribund. The humanities mustabandon their insular fiefdoms and begin thinking in terms of imagination, apower that crosses the genres and unites high with popular art, the noble withthe sleazy. There is neither decline nor disaster in the triumph of mass media,only a shift from word to image—in other words, a return to western culture’spre-Gutenberg, pre-Protestant pagan pictorialism.That popular culture reclaims what high culture shuts out is clear in the caseof pornography. Pornography is pure pagan imagism. Just as a poem is rituallylimited verbal expression, so is pornography ritually limited visual expressionof the daemonism of sex and nature. Every shot, every angle in pornography, nomatter how silly, twisted, or pasty, is yet another attempt to get the wholepicture of the enormity of chthonian nature. Is pornography art? Yes. Art iscontemplation and conceptualization, the ritual exhibitionism of primalmysteries. Art makes order of nature’s cyclonic brutality. Art, I said, is fullof crimes. The ugliness and violence in pornography reflect the ugliness andviolence in nature.Pornography’s male-born explicitness renders visible what is invisible, woman’schthonian internality. It tries to shed Apollonian light on woman’sanxiety-provoking darkness. The vulgar contortionism of pornography is theserpentine tangle of Medusan nature. Pornography is human imagination in tensetheatrical action; its violations are a protest against the violations of ourfreedom by nature. The banning of pornography, rightly sought byJudeo-Christianity, would be a victory over the west’s stubborn paganism. Butpornography cannot be banned, only driven underground, where its illicit chargewill be enhanced. Pornography’s amoral pictorialism will live forever as arebuke to the humanistic cult of the redemptive word. Words cannot save thecruel flux of pagan nature.The western eye makes things, idols of Apollonian objectification. Pornographymakes many well-meaning people uncomfortable because it isolates the voyeuristicelement present in all art, and especially cinema. All the personae of art aresex objects. The emotional response of spectator or reader is inseparable fromerotic response. As I said, our lives as physical beings are a Dionysiancontinuum of pleasure-pain. At every moment we are steeped in the sensory, evenin sleep. Emotional arousal is sensual arousal; sensual arousal is sexualarousal. The idea that emotion can be separated from sex is a Christianillusion, one of the most ingenious but finally unworkable strategies inChristianity’s ancient campaign against pagan nature. Agape, spiritual love,belongs to eros but has run away from home.We are voyeurs at the perimeters of art, and there is a sadomasochisticsensuality in our responses to it. Art is a scandal, literally a “stumblingblock,” to all moralism, whether on the Christian right or Rousseauist left.Pornography and art are inseparable, because there is voyeurism and voracity inall our sensations as seeing, feeling beings. The fullest exploration of theseideas is Edmund Spenser’s Renaissance epic, The Faerie Queene. In this poem,which prefigures cinema by its radiant Apollonian projections, the voyeuristicand sadomasochistic latency in art and sex is copiously documented. Westernperception is a daemonic theater of ritual surprise. We may not like what we seewhen we look into the dark mirror of art.Sex object, art work, personality: western experience is cellular and divisive.It imposes a graph of marked-off spaces on nature’s continuity and flow. We havemade Apollonian demarcations that function as ritual preserves against nature;hence our complex criminal codes and elaborate erotics of transgression. Theweakness in radical critiques of sex and society is that they fail to recognizethat sex needs ritual binding to control its daemonism and secondly thatsociety’s repressions increase sexual pleasure. There is nothing less eroticthan a nudist colony. Desire is intensified by ritual limitations. Hence themask, harness, and chains of sadomasochism.The western cells of holiness and criminality are a cognitive advance in humanhistory. Our cardinal myths are Faust, who locks himself in his study to readbooks and crack the code of nature, and Don Juan, who makes a war of pleasureand counts his conquests by Apollonian number. Both are cellular egos, seducersand criminal knowers, in whom sex, thought, and aggression are fused. This cellseparated from nature is our brain and eye. Our hard personalities are imagisticprojections from the Apollonian higher cortex. Personae are visible ideas. Allfacial expressions and theatrical postures, present among animal primates, arefleeting shadows of personae. While Japanese decorum limits facial expressions,western art since the Hellenistic era has recorded every permutation of irony,anxiety, flirtation, and menace. The hardness of our personalities and thetension with which they are set off from nature have produced the west’svulnerability to decadence. Tension leads to fatigue and collapse, “late” phasesof history in which sadomasochism flourishes. As I will show, decadence is adisease of the eye, a sexual intensification of artistic voyeurism.The Apollonian things of western sex and art reach their economic glorificationin capitalism. In the past fifteen years, Marxist approaches to literature haveenjoyed increasing vogue. To be conscious of the social context of art seemsautomatically to entail a leftist orientation. But a theory is possible that isboth avant-garde and capitalist. Marxism was one of Rousseau’snineteenth-century progeny, energized by faith in the perfectibility of man. Itsbelief that economic forces are the primary dynamic in history is Romanticnaturism in disguise. That is, it sketches a surging wave-motion in the materialcontext of human life but tries to deny the perverse daemonism of that context.Marxism is the bleakest of anxiety-formations against the power of chthonianmothers. Its influence on modern historiography has been excessive. The “greatman” theory of history was not as simplistic as claimed; we have barelyrecovered from a world war in which this theory was proved evilly true. One mancan change the course of history, for good or ill. Marxism is a flight from themagic of person and the mystique of hierarchy. It distorts the character ofwestern culture, which is based on charismatic power of person. Marxism can workonly in pre-industrial societies of homogeneous populations. Raise the standardof living, and the rainbow riot of individualism will break out. Personality andart, which Marxism fears and censors, rebound from every effort to repress them.Capitalism, gaudy and greedy, has been inherent in western aesthetics fromancient Egypt on. It is the mysticism and glamour of things, which take on apersonality of their own. As an economic system, it is in the Darwinian line ofSade, not Rousseau. The capitalist survival of the fittest is already present inthe Iliad. Western sexual personae clash by day and by night. Homer’s gleamingbronze-clad warriors are the Apollonian soup cans that crowd the sunny templesof our supermarkets and compete for our attention on television. The westobjectifies persons and personalizes objects. The teeming multiplicity ofcapitalist products is an Apollonian correction of nature. Brand names areterritorial cells of western identity. Our shiny chrome automobiles, like ourarmies of grocery boxes and cans, are extrapolations of hard, impermeablewestern personality.Capitalist products are another version of the art works flooding westernculture. The portable framed painting appeared at the birth of modern commercein the early Renaissance. Capitalism and art have challenged and nourished eachother ever since. Capitalist and artist are parallel types: the artist is justas amoral and acquisitive as the capitalist, and just as hostile to competitors.That in the age of the merchant-prince art works are hawked and sold like hotdogs supports my argument but is not central to it. Western culture is animatedby a visionary materialism. Apollonian formalism has stolen from nature to makea romance of things, hard, shiny, crass, and willful.The capitalist distribution network, a complex chain of factory, transport,warehouse, and retail outlet, is one of the greatest male accomplishments in thehistory of culture. It is a lightning-quick Apollonian circuit of male bonding.One of feminism’s irritating reflexes is its fashionable disdain for“patriarchal society,” to which nothing good is ever attributed. But it ispatriarchal society that has freed me as a woman. It is capitalism that hasgiven me the leisure to sit at this desk writing this book. Let us stop beingsmall-minded about men and freely acknowledge what treasures their obsessivenesshas poured into culture.We could make an epic catalog of male achievements, from paved roads, indoorplumbing, and washing machines to eyeglasses, antibiotics, and disposablediapers. We enjoy fresh, safe milk and meat, and vegetables and tropical fruitsheaped in snowbound cities. When I cross the George Washington Bridge or any ofAmerica’s great bridges, I think: men have done this. Construction is a sublimemale poetry. When I see a giant crane passing on a flatbed truck, I pause in aweand reverence, as one would for a church procession. What power of conception,what grandiosity: these cranes tie us to ancient Egypt, where monumentalarchitecture was first imagined and achieved. If civilization had been left infemale hands, we would still be living in grass huts. A contemporary womanclapping on a hard hat merely enters a conceptual system invented by men.Capitalism is an art form, an Apollonian fabrication to rival nature. It ishypocritical for feminists and intellectuals to enjoy the pleasures andconveniences of capitalism while sneering at it. Even Thoreau’s Walden was justa two-year experiment. Everyone born into capitalism has incurred a debt to it.Give Caesar his due.The pagan dialectic of Apollonian and Dionysian was sweepingly comprehensive andaccurate about mind and nature. Christian love is so lacking its emotionalpolarity that the Devil had to be invented to focus natural human hatred andhostility. Rousseauism’s Christianized psychology has led to the tendency ofliberals toward glumness or depression in the face of the political tensions,wars, and atrocities that daily contradict their assumptions. Perhaps the morewe are sensitized by reading and education, the more we must repress the factsof chthonian nature. But the insupportable feminist dichotomy between sex andpower must go. Just as the hatreds of divorce court expose the dark face beneaththe mask of love, so is the truth about nature revealed during crisis. Victimsof tornado and hurricane instinctively speak of “the fury of Mother Nature”—howoften we hear that phrase as the television camera follows dazed survivorspicking through the wreckage of homes and towns. In the unconscious, everyoneknows that Jehovah has never gained control of the savage elements. Nature isPandemonium, an All Devils’ Day.There are no accidents, only nature throwing her weight around. Even the bombmerely releases energy that nature has put there. Nuclear war would be just aspark in the grandeur of space. Nor can radiation “alter” nature: she willabsorb it all. After the bomb, nature will pick up the cards we have spilled,shuffle them, and begin her game again. Nature is forever playing solitaire withherself.Western love has been ambivalent from the start. As early as Sappho (600 B.C.)or even earlier in the epic legend of Helen of Troy, art records the push andpull of attraction and hostility in that perverse fascination we call love.There is a magnetics of eroticism in the west, due to the hardness of westernpersonality: eroticism is an electric forcefield between masks. The modernpursuit of self-realization has not led to sexual happiness, because assertionsof selfhood merely release the amoral chaos of libido. Freedom is the mostoverrated modern idea, originating in the Romantic rebellion against bourgeoissociety. But only in society can one be an individual. Nature is waiting atsociety’s gates to dissolve us in her chthonian bosom. Out with stereotypes,feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west’s stunning sexual personae, thevehicles of art’s assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, thereis myth. We may have to accept an ethical cleavage between imagination andreality, tolerating horrors, rapes, and mutilations in art that we would nottolerate in society. For art is our message from the beyond, telling us whatnature is up to. Not sex but cruelty is the great neglected or suppressed itemon the modern humanistic agenda. We must honor the chthonian but not necessarilyyield to it. In The Rape of the Lock, Pope counsels good humor as the onlysolution to sex war. So with our enslavement by chthonian nature. We must acceptour pain, change what we can, and laugh at the rest. But let us see art for whatit is and nature for what it is. From remotest antiquity, western art has been aparade of sexual personae, emanations of absolutist western mind. Western art isa cinema of sex and dreaming. Art is form struggling to wake from the nightmareof nature."},{"pageContent":"2THE BIRTH OF THE WESTERN EYEMythology begins with cosmogony, the creation of the world. Somehow out of thechaos of matter comes order. The plenum, a soupy fullness, divides itself intoobjects and beings. Cosmogonies vary among societies. Earth-cult admits thepriority and primacy of nature. For Judeo-Christianity, a sky-cult, God createsnature rather than vice versa. His consciousness precedes and engulfs all.Hebrew cosmogony, in the polemical poetry of Genesis, is lofty in its claims.Creation is rational and systematic. The evolution of forms proceedsmajestically, without carnage or cataclysm. God presides with workmanlikedetachment. The cosmos is something constructed, a framed dwelling for man. Godis a spirit, a presence. He has no name and no body. He is beyond sex andagainst sex, which belongs to the lower realm. Yet God is distinctly he, afather and not a mother. Femaleness is subordinate, an afterthought. Eve ismerely a sliver pulled from Adam’s belly. Maleness is magic, the potentprinciple of universal creativity.The book of Genesis is a male declaration of independence from the ancientmother-cults. Its challenge to nature, so sexist to modern ears, marks one ofthe crucial moments in western history. Mind can never be free of matter. Yetonly by mind imagining itself free can culture advance. The mother-cults, byreconciling man to nature, entrapped him in matter. Everything great in westerncivilization has come from struggle against our origins. Genesis is rigid andunjust, but it gave man hope as a man. It remade the world by male dynasty,cancelling the power of mothers.Jehovah exists somewhere outside his creation, beyond space and time. Mostancient cosmogonies begin with a primeval being who embraces all opposites andcontains everything that is or can be. Why should any eternal, self-sufficientgod add to what already is? Whether out of loneliness or a craving for drama,primeval deities set off the motion-machine and add to their own troubles. Myfavorite such god is Egyptian Khepera, who gives birth to the second stage ofexistence by an act of masturbation: “I had union with my hand, and I embracedmy shadow in a love embrace; I poured seed into my own mouth, and sent forthfrom myself issue in the form of the gods Shu and Tefnut.”1[ch25_notes.html#ch02note1a] Logically, primeval hierarchs must dig intothemselves to continue the story of creation. Jehovah, as much as Khepera,multiplies by self-compounding.Virtually all cosmogonies but ours are overtly sexual. The primeval deity may behermaphroditic, like Egypt’s mother goddess Mut, who has both male and femalegenitals. Or there is wholesale incest, the only sex possible when the in-groupis the only group. Developed mythologies ignore the incest or edit it out, asGenesis does in discreetly passing over the question of whom Cain and Abel mustmarry to get on with history. Similarly, Greek myth stresses Hera as Zeus’ wifebut makes little of the fact that she is also his sister. In Egypt there neverwas so stringent a purification of sacred texts, and primitive motifs lingeredon to the end. Isis and Osiris are distinctly sister and brother as well as wifeand husband. Egyptian gods are tangled in archaic family romance. The mothergoddess Hathor, for example, is eerily called “the mother of her father and thedaughter of her son.” As in Romanticism, identity is regressive andsupercondensed. The sexual irregularities of fertility gods are intrinsic to thedark, disorderly mystery of sexual growth.Judaism, though ascribing artfulness to God, is inhospitable to art in man.Earth-cult’s lurid sexual symbolism contains a psychic truth: there is a sexualelement in all creation, in nature or art. Khepera eating his own seed is amodel of Romantic creativity, where the self is isolated and sexually dual.Khepera bent over himself is a uroboros, the serpent eating its own tail, amagic circle of regeneration and rebirth. The uroboros is the prehistoric trackof natural cycle, from which Judaism and Hellenism make a conceptual break.Later in this book, I will argue that Romanticism restores the archaic westernpast, divining lost or suppressed pagan myths. Incest, erotic solipsism, iseverywhere in Romantic poetry. Masturbation, subliminal in Coleridge and Poe,boldly emerges in later Romantics like Walt Whitman, Aubrey Beardsley, and JeanGenet, libidinous solitary dreamers. Khepera is the androgyne as demiurge.The supreme symbol of fertility religion is the Great Mother, a figure ofdouble-sexed primal power. Many mother goddesses of the Mediterranean world wereindiscriminately fused in the syncretism of the Roman empire. They includeEgyptian Isis, Cretan and Mycenaean Gaia and Rhea, Cyprian Aphrodite, PhrygianCybele, Ephesian Artemis, Syrian Dea, Persian Anaitis, Babylonian Ishtar,Phoenician Astarte, Canaanite Atargatis, Cappadocian Mâ, and Thracian Bendis andCottyto. The Great Mother embodied the gigantism and unknowability of primevalnature. She descended from the period before agriculture, when nature seemedautocratic and capricious. Woman and nature were in mysterious harmony. Earlyman saw no necessary connection between coitus and conception, since sexualrelations often preceded menstruation. Even today, pregnancy is unpredictableand takes months to show. Woman’s fertility, following its own laws, inspiredawe and fear.Though woman was at the center of early symbolism, real women were powerless. Afantasy dogging feminist writing is that there was once a peaceable matriarchyoverthrown by warmongering men, founders of patriarchal society. The idea beganwith Bachofen in the nineteenth century and was adopted by Jane Harrison, thatgreat scholar’s one error. Not a shred of evidence supports the existence ofmatriarchy anywhere in the world at any time. Matriarchy, political rule bywomen, must not be confused with matrilineage, passive transmission of propertyor authority through the female side. The matriarchy hypothesis, revived byAmerican feminism, continues to flourish outside the university.Primitive life, far from peaceable, was submerged in the turbulence of nature.Man’s superior strength provided protection to women, particularly in theincapacitating final stages of pregnancy. The polarization of sex roles probablyoccurred rather early. Men roamed and hunted, while women in their gatheringforays ventured no farther from the campsite than they could carry their nursinginfants. There was simple logic in this, not injustice. The link between fatherand child was a late development. Margaret Mead remarks, “Human fatherhood is asocial invention.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note2a] James Joyce says, “Paternitymay be a legal fiction.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note3a] Society had advanced whenthe male contribution to conception was acknowledged. Both sexes have profitedfrom the consolidation and stability of the family.The myth of matriarchy may have originated in our universal experience of motherpower in infancy. We are all born from a female colossus. Erich Neumann callsthe first stage of psychic development “matriarchal.”4[ch25_notes.html#ch02note4a] Therefore every person’s passage from nursery tosociety is an overthrow of matriarchy. As history, the idea of matriarchy isspurious, but as metaphor, it is poetically resonant. It is crucial for theinterpretation of dreams and art, in which the mother remains dominant.Matriarchy hovers behind art works like the Venus de Milo, Mona Lisa, andWhistler’s Mother, which popular imagination has made culturally archetypal. Wewill examine the way Romanticism, as part of its archaizing movement, restoresthe mother to matriarchal power, notably in Goethe, Wordsworth, and Swinburne.The autonomy of the ancient mother goddesses was sometimes called virginity. Avirgin fertility seems contradictory, but it survives in the Christian VirginBirth. Hera and Aphrodite annually renewed their virginity by bathing in asacred spring. The same duality appears in Artemis, who was honored both asvirgin huntress and patron of childbirth. The Great Mother is a virgin insofaras she is independent of men. She is a sexual dictator, symbolicallyimpenetrable. Males are nonpersons: Neumann elsewhere speaks of “the anonymouspower of the fertilizing agent.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note5a] Thus Joyce’ssensual Great Mother, Molly Bloom, sleepily mulls over all the men in her lifeas “he,” implying their casual interchangeability. The Great Mother did not evenneed a male to fertilize her: the Egyptian goddess Net gives birth to Ra byparthenogenesis or self-fecundation.The mother goddess gives life but takes it away. Lucretius says, “The universalmother is also the common grave.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note6a] She is morallyambivalent, violent as well as benevolent. The sanitized pacifist goddesspromoted by feminism is wishful thinking. From prehistory to the end of theRoman empire, the Great Mother never lost her barbarism. She is theever-changing face of chthonian nature, now savage, now smiling. The medievalMadonna, a direct descendant of Isis, is a Great Mother with her chthonianterror removed. She has lost her roots in nature, because it is pagan naturethat Christianity rose to oppose.The masculine side of the Great Mother is often expressed in serpents, woundabout her arms or body. Mary trampling the serpent underfoot recalls paganimages in which goddess and serpent are one. The serpent inhabits the womblikeunderworld of mother earth. It is both male and female, piercing and strangling.Apuleius calls the Syrian goddess “omnipotens et omniparens,” all-potent andall-producing.7 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note7a] Energy and abundance on so vast ascale can be crushing and cold. The fluid serpent will never be converted tofriend.The goddess’ animal fecundity was cruelly dramatized in ritual. Her devoteespracticed castration, breast-amputation, self-flagellation or slashing, anddismemberment of beasts. This sacrificial extremity of experience mimics thehorrors of chthonian nature. Today such behavior survives only in sexualsadomasochism, universally labeled perverse. I think sadomasochism an archaizingphenomenon, returning the imagination to pagan nature-worship. Lewis Farnellsays whipping in vegetation-rites was meant to increase fertility or, moreoften, “to drive out from the body impure influences or spirits, so that it maybecome the purer vehicle of divine force.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note8a] In theRoman Lupercalia, depicted in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, youths ran nakedthrough the streets and struck matrons with leather thongs to stimulatechildbearing. Newlyweds are pelted with rice to drive off evil spirits andfertilize the bride. Blows mark a rite of passage into maturity. The kneelingknight is struck with sword on shoulder by his lord. At Catholic Confirmation,the kneeling adolescent is slapped by the bishop. The Orthodox Jewish girl atfirst menstruation is slapped by her mother. In Stover at Yale (1911), the luckyinitiate to Skull and Bones is ambushed at night and slammed on the back. Blowsare archaic magic, punishing marks of election.Castration in the mother-cults may have imitated the reaping of crops. Onlystone tools could be used for ritual castration; bronze or iron was forbidden,indicating the custom’s prehistoric origins. Edith Weigert-Vowinkel endorses theview that the Phrygians borrowed castration from the Semites, who altered itover time to circumcision, and that the celibacy of Catholic priests is a’substitute for castration.9 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note9a] The halolike tonsure ofCatholic monks, like the shaved heads of priests of Isis, is a lesserself-mutilation. By castration, the devotee subordinated himself to the femalelife force. Contact with the goddess was dangerous. After making love withAphrodite, Anchises ended up crippled, so that he had to be carried from burningTroy by his son Aeneas. The story that he was punished for boasting of his trystis likely a late addition. H. J. Rose says of Anchises’ handicap, “The businessof fertilizing the Great Mother was so exacting as utterly to exhaust thestrength of her inferior male partner, who consequently, if he did not die,became a eunuch.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note10a] Maleness is obliterated byshocks of female power.Self-castration was a one-way road to ritual impersonation. In the mysteryreligions, which influenced Christianity, the devotee imitated and sought unionwith his god. The priest of the Great Mother changed sex in order to become her.Transsexualism was the severe choice, transvestism less so. In ceremonies atSyracuse, men were initiated in Demeter’s purple robe. In ancient Mexico, awoman representing the goddess was flayed and her skin put on by a male priest.The Great Mother’s eunuch priest was called “she.” Thus after Catullus’ Attiscastrates himself, the pronouns shift from masculine to feminine. Today,etiquette requires one to refer to the urban drag queen as “she,” even when heis in male dress.Spiritual enlightenment produces feminization of the male. Mead says, “The moreintricate biological pattern of the female has become a model for the artist,the mystic, and the saint.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note11a] Intuition orextrasensory perception is a feminine hearkening to the secret voices in andbeyond things. Farnell says, “Many ancient observers noted that women (andeffeminate men) were especially prone to orgiastic religious seizure.”12[ch25_notes.html#ch02note12a] Hysteria means womb-madness (from the Greekustera, “womb”). Women were sibyls and oracles, subject to prophetic visions.Herodotus speaks of Scythian Enarees, male prophets afflicted by a “femaledisease,” probably sexual impotence.13 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note13a] Thisphenomenon called shamanism migrated northward to Central Asia and has beenreported in North and South America and Polynesia. Frazer describes the shaman’sstages of sexual transformation, which resemble those of our candidates forsex-reassignment surgery. The religious call may come as a dream in which theman is “possessed by a female spirit.” He adopts female speech, hair style, andclothing and finally takes a husband.14 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note14a] TheSiberian shaman, who wears a woman’s caftan sewn with large round disks asfemale breasts, is for Mircea Eliade an example of “ritual androgyny,”symbolizing the coincidentia oppositorum or reconciliation of opposites.15[ch25_notes.html#ch02note15a] Inspired, the shaman goes into a trance and fallsunconscious. He may disappear, either to fly over distant lands or to die and beresurrected. The shaman is an archaic prototype of the artist, who also crossessexes and commands space and time. How many modern transsexuals areunacknowledged shamans? Perhaps it is to poets they should go for counsel,rather than surgeons.Teiresias, the androgynous Greek shaman, is depicted as an old man with longbeard and pendulous female breasts. In Homer, Circe tells Odysseus his quest forhome cannot succeed until he descends to the underworld to consult the seer. Itis as if Teiresias, in the underworld of racial memory, represents a fullness ofemotional knowledge fusing the sexes. The masculine glamour of the Iliad isgone. When we first see the hero of the Odyssey, he is weeping. The rulingvirtues of this poem are female perception and endurance, rather than aggressiveaction. In Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex, Teiresias is the hero’s double. Teiresias andOedipus are involuntary initiates into an uncanny range of sexual experience. Atthe start, Teiresias holds the key to the mystery of plague and perversion. Healone knows the secret of Oedipal family romance, with its inflamedmultiplicities of identity: Oedipus is husband and son, father and brother. Atplay’s end, Oedipus has literally become Teiresias, a blind holy man who paysthe price of esoteric knowledge. In The Waste Land, T. S. Eliot, followingApollinaire, makes Teiresias the witness and repository of modern sexualmiseries.How did Teiresias become an androgyne? On Mount Cithaeron (where infant Oedipuswas exposed), he stumbled upon two snakes mating, for which he was punished bybeing turned into a woman. Seven years later, he came upon the same sight andwas turned back into a man. The tale confirms the terrible consequences ofseeing something forbidden to mortals. Thus Actaeon was torn to pieces by hishunting dogs for finding Artemis at her bath. Callimachus claims Teiresias wasblinded for accidentally seeing Athena bathing. Hesiod says: “This sameTeiresias was chosen by Zeus and Hera to decide the question whether the male orthe female has most pleasure in intercourse. And he said: ‘Of ten parts a manenjoys one only; but a woman’s sense enjoys all ten in full.’ For this Hera wasangry and blinded him, but Zeus gave him the seer’s power.”16[ch25_notes.html#ch02note16a] The oldest part of Teiresias’ story is the meetingwith mating snakes, a chthonian motif. The uncanny or grotesque in myth isevidence of extreme antiquity. The bantering comic tone of Zeus and Hera’sdomestic dispute marks it as later ornamentation. Charm in myths is a coming infrom the chthonian cold.I adopt the name “Teiresias” for a category of androgyne, the nurturant male ormale mother. He can be found in sculptures of classical river gods, in Romanticpoetry (Wordsworth and Keats), and in modern popular culture (televisiontalk-show hosts). I take one more model from Greek prophetic transsexualism, theDelphic oracle. Delphi, holiest spot of the ancient Mediterranean, was oncededicated to female deities, as the priestess recalls at the opening ofAeschylus’ Eumenides. W. F. Jackson Knight asserts that “Delphi means the femalegenerative organ.”17 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note17a] The delta has been found tosymbolize the female pubes in societies as far as the Brazilian jungle. TheDelphic oracle was called the Pythia or Pythoness after the giant serpent Pytho,slain by invading Apollo. Legend claims the oracle was maddened by fumes risingfrom a chasm above the decaying chthonian serpent. But no chasm has been foundat Delphi.The oracle was Apollo’s high priestess and spoke for him. Pilgrims, royal andlowly, arrived at Delphi with questions and left with cryptic replies. It wasafter descending from Delphi that Oedipus collided with his father at thecrossroads—a spot in the Greek pastureland still unchanged after three thousandyears of ghostly legend. The prophesying oracle was the instrument of the god ofpoetry, a lyre upon which he played. E. R. Dodds states, “The Pythia becameentheos, plena deo: the god entered into her and used her vocal organs as ifthey were his own, exactly as the so-called ‘control’ does in modernspirit-mediumship; that is why Apollo’s Delphic utterances are always couched inthe first person, never in the third.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note18a] Thisresembles the ventriloquism Frazer ascribes to entranced shamans. Michelangelouses the Delphic metaphor in a madrigal comparing a Renaissance virago,intellectual and poet Vittoria Colonna, to the oracle: “A man in a woman, indeeda god, speaks through her mouth.” The Delphic oracle is a woman invaded by amale spirit. She suffers usurpation of identity, like the mentalsextransformations of great dramatists and novelists. I designate as “thePythoness” another category of androgyne, of which my best example will be thesibylline comedienne Gracie Allen.The Great Mother is the master image from which split off surrogate subforms offemale horrors, like Gorgon and Fury. The vagina dentata literalizes the sexualanxiety of these myths. In the North American Indian version, says Neumann, “Ameat-eating fish inhabits the vagina of the Terrible Mother; the hero is the manwho overcomes the Terrible Mother, breaks the teeth out of her vagina, and somakes her into a woman.”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note19a] The toothed vagina isno sexist hallucination: every penis is made less in every vagina, just asmankind, male and female, is devoured by mother nature. The vagina dentata ispart of the Romantic revival of pagan myth. It is subliminally present in Poe’svoracious maelstrom and dank, scythe-swept pit. It overtly appears in the bibleof French Decadence, Huysmans’ A Rebours (1884), where a dreamer is magneticallydrawn toward mother nature’s open thighs, the “bloody depths” of a carnivorousflower rimmed by “swordblades.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note20a]The Greek Gorgon was a kind of vagina dentata. In Archaic art, she is a grinninghead with beard, tusks, and outthrust tongue. She has snakes in her hair oraround her waist. She runs in swastika form, a symbol of primitive vitality. Herbeard, a postmenopausal virilization, turns up on the witches of Macbeth. She islike a jack-o’-lantern or death’s-head, the spectral night face of mothernature. The gorgoneion or “bodiless head of fright” antedates by many centuriesthe Gorgon with a woman’s body.21 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note21a] The Perseuslegend obscures an ancient prototype: the hero seizes a trophy that cannot besevered or slain (fig. 1 [ch02.html#ch02fig1]).Men, never women, are turned to stone by gazing at Medusa. Freud interprets thisas the “terror of castration” felt by boys at their first glimpse of femalegenitals.22 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note22a] Richard Tristman feels the staringmechanism involved in male consumption of pornography is a compulsive scrutinyor searching for the missing female penis. That female genitals do resemble awound is evident in those slang terms “slash” and “gash.” Huysmans calls thegenital flower a “hideous flesh-wound.” Flower, mouth, wound: the Gorgon is areverse image of the Mystic Rose of Mary. Woman’s genital wound is a furrow infemale earth. Snaky Medusa is the thorny undergrowth of nature’s relentlessfertility.Image [../images/f0048-01.jpg]1. Perseus Cutting Off the Head of Medusa, from the metope of Temple C atSelinus, Sicily, ca. 550–540 B.C.The Gorgon’s name comes from the adjective gorgos, “terrible, fearful, fierce.”Gorgopos, “fierce-eyed, terrible,” is an epithet of Athena, who wears theGorgon’s head on breast and shield, a gift from Perseus. It is an apotropaion, acharm to ward off evil spirits, like the giant eye painted on prows of ancientships. Jackson Knight says of the gorgoneion, “It occurs on shields, on thebrow-bands of war-horses, and on the doors of ovens, where it was meant toexclude evil influences from the bread.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note23a] JaneHarrison compares the Gorgon’s head to primitive ritual masks: “They are thenatural agents of a religion of fear and ‘riddance’…. The function of such masksis permanently to ‘make an ugly face’, at you if you are doing wrong, breakingyour word, robbing your neighbor, meeting him in battle; for you if you aredoing right.”24 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note24a] Apotropaic charms are common inItaly, where belief in the evil eye is still strong. Gold hands and red or goldhorns dangle from necks and hang in kitchens next to chains of garlic to driveaway vampires. The Mediterranean has never lost its chthonian cultism.I use the apotropaic gorgoneion in two major ways. Art and religion come fromthe same part of the mind. Great cult symbols transfer smoothly into artisticexperience. Solitary or highly original artists often make apotropaic art. TheMona Lisa, for example, seems to have functioned as an apotropaion for Leonardo,who refused to part with it until his death at the court of the French king(hence its presence in the Louvre). Ambiguous Mona Lisa, presiding over herdesolate landscape, is a gorgoneion, staring hierarch of pitiless nature.A second apotropaion: Joyce’s dense modernist style. Joyce has only onesubject—Ireland. His writing is both a protest against an intolerable spiritualdependency and ironically an immortalization of the power that bound him.Ireland is a Gorgon, in Joyce’s words “the Mother Sow who eats her children.”Knight compares the mazelike meander design on Greek houses to “tangled thread”charms on British doorsteps: “Tangled drawings are meant to entangle intruders,as the tangled reality of a labyrinthine construction at the approach to a fortactually helps very much to entangle attackers.”25 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note25a]Language as labyrinth: Joyce’s aggressive impenetrability is the hex sign ofHarrison’s “religion of fear and ‘riddance’.” We will later examine the creatorof the first impenetrable modern style, Henry James. There we return full circleto the Great Mother, for my theory is that James’s Decadent late style is theheavy ritual transvestism of a eunuch-priest of the mother goddess.My third apotropaion: Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, a novel as ghostdance, as invocation and exorcism. From Woolf’s diary:Father’s birthday. He would have been 96, 96, yes, today; and could have been96, like other people one has known: but mercifully was not. His life would haveentirely ended mine. What would have happened? No writing, nobooks—inconceivable.I used to think of him and mother daily; but writing the Lighthouse laid them inmy mind. And now he comes back sometimes, but differently. (I believe this to betrue—that I was obsessed by them both, unhealthily; and writing of them was anecessary act.)26 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note26a]An apotropaion bars encroachment by the dead. The ghost of Odysseus’ mother, letus recall, is thirsty for blood. Unsentimentally, Woolf wishes for no longeryears for her father. Contest for life is a Sade an power struggle. To theLighthouse is filled with imagines, ancestor masks. The Romans put them in theatrium to keep them out of the bedroom. As family romance, To the Lighthouse isthe gorgoneion on the oven door, which must be shut to make a room of one’s own.The novel has a second ritual pattern: the Eleusinian heuresis or “findingagain” of Persephone by Demeter. In To the Lighthouse, mother and daughterreunite, but only to bid farewell.Now my other major use of the gorgoneion. The ugly staring Gorgon is thedaemonic eye. She is the paralyzing animal eye of chthonian nature, theglittering, mesmerizing eye of vampires and seductresses. The tusked Gorgon isthe eye which eats. In other words, the eye is still bound to biology. Ithungers. I will show that the west invented a new eye, contemplative,conceptual, the eye of art. It was born in Egypt. This is the Apollonian solardisk, illuminating and idealizing. The Gorgon is the night eye, Apollo the day.I will argue that the origin of the Greek Apollonian is in Egypt. Greek ideasare creatures of Egyptian formalism. It is untrue the Egyptians had no ideas.There are, I said, ideas in images. Egyptian images made western imagination.Egypt liberated and divinized the human eye. The Apollonian eye is the brain’sgreat victory over the bloody open mouth of mother nature.Only the Sphinx is as symbolically rich as the Gorgon. There are benign malesphinxes in Egypt, but the famous one is female, born of the incest ofhalf-serpent Echidna with her dog-son Orthus. The Sphinx has a woman’s head andbosom, a griffin’s wings, and a lion’s claws and rump. Her name means “theThrottler” (from the Greek sphiggo, “strangle”). The riddle by which she defeatsall men but Oedipus is the ungraspable mystery of nature, which will defeatOedipus anyway. The Gorgon rules the eye, while the Sphinx rules words. Sherules them by stopping them, stillborn, in the throat. Poets appeal to the Museto stave off the Sphinx. In Coleridge’s Christabel, one of the great horrorstories of Romanticism, Muse and Sphinx merge, changing the poet’s sex andmaking him mute. Birth is taking first breath. But the Sphinx of naturethrottles us in the womb.Other subforms of the Great Mother cluster in groups. The Furies or Erinyes areavengers. Without fixed shape in Homer, they first gain one in the Oresteia.Hesiod says the Furies sprang from drops of blood falling to earth from Uranus’castration by his son Cronos. They are cruel chthonian emanations of the soil.The motif of seminal splashes recurs in Pegasus’ birth from drops of blood fromMedusa’s severed head—suggesting the Gorgon’s half-maleness. In early ritual,throats were cut or blood poured directly on the field to stimulate earth’sfertility. The ugly, barbaric Furies are first cousin to Aphrodite. She comesfrom another seminal splashdown, from the foam cast up by Uranus’ castratedorgans hitting the sea. It is her arrival on shore, by convenient seashell, thatBotticelli depicts in The Birth of Venus. Aphrodite is therefore a Fury washedclean of her chthonian origins. Aeschylus gives the Furies a doglike rheum:their eyes drip with pus. They are the daemonic eye as running sore, theimpacted, putrefying womb of nature.The Harpies are servants of the Furies. They are “the Snatchers” (from harpazo,“snatch”), airborne pirates, befouling men with their droppings. They representthe aspect of femaleness that clutches and kills in order to feed itself. Thearchetypal power of Alfred Hitchcock’s great saga of malevolent nature, TheBirds (1963), comes from its reactivation of the Harpy myth, shown as both birdand woman. Keres resemble Harpies as female carriers of disease and pollution.They are smoky intruders from the underworld. Greek art and literature never didcrystallize a shape and story for them, so they remain vague. The Sirens, on theother hand, made it into the erotic big time. They are graveyard creatures whoappear in Archaic art much like Harpies, as birds with female heads and malebeards. Homer’s Sirens are twin singers luring sailors to destruction on therocks: “They sit there in a meadow piled high with the mouldering skeletons ofmen, whose withered skin still hangs upon their bones.”27[ch25_notes.html#ch02note27a] The Sirens are the triumph of matter. Man’sspiritual trajectory ends in the rubbish heap of his own mother-born body.Some female monsters shifted from plural to singular. Lamia, a bisexual Greekand Roman succubus who kidnapped children and drank their blood, was once one ofmany, like the child-killer Mormo. Joseph Fontenrose calls the Lamiai “phasmatathat rose from earth in woods and glens,” while the Mormones were “wanderingdaimones.”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note28a] Gello, another child-stealer, remainspart of Greek superstition today. The night-stalking vampire Empusa devoured herprey after the sex act. These examples catch myth midcourse. Spooks and goblins,who run in packs in the primeval murk, begin to emerge as personalities. Butthey must be condensed and refined by the popular imagination or by a greatpoet.Circe owes everything to Homer. An Italian sorceress living among pigs has beengorgeously enhanced with cinematic glamour. Lordly in her cold stone house,Circe waves her phallic wand over her subject males, grunting in the slop ofinfancy. She is the prison of sex, a tomb in a thicket. Circe’s Hebrewcounterpart is Lilith, Adam’s first wife, whose name means “of the night.”Harold Bloom says Lilith, originally a Babylonian wind-demoness, soughtascendancy in the sex act: “The vision men call Lilith is formed primarily bytheir anxiety at what they perceive to be the beauty of a woman’s body, a beautythey believe to be, at once, far greater and far less than their own.”29[ch25_notes.html#ch02note29a] Like Aphrodite, Circe and Lilith are the ugly madebeautiful. Nature’s Medusan hag dons her magic mask in the hall of art.Sexually dominated by him, Circe warns Odysseus of future dangers. Herdescription of Scylla has relish, for Scylla is her outdoor alter ego, a cliffmonster with twelve feet, six heads, and triple rows of teeth who plucks sailorsoff ships. Like the Harpy, she is a Snatcher, a gnawing female appetite.Scylla’s female companion, Charybdis, is her upside-down mirror image. Suckingand spewing three times a day, the killer whirlpool is the womb-vortex of thenature mother. It is probably into Charybdis that Poe’s hero sinks in Descentinto the Maelström. Ovid’s Circe stunts Scylla’s legs and girds her belly with apack of wild dogs with “gaping mouths.”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note30a] Scyllabecomes a vagina dentata or sexual she-wolf. At the gates of Hell in Milton’sParadise Lost, she is Sin, the torso of a beautiful woman ending in a scalyserpent with a scorpion’s sting. Her waist is ringed with screeching hellhoundsthat kennel in her womb. The dogs are insatiable, ulcerating lusts, like theIndian maneating fish. Sexual disillusion leads to Scylla and Charybdis. KingLear, hanging a white beard on his witchy daughter Goneril, sees woman asanimal-loined, a stinking “sulphurous pit” sucking men to hell (IV.vi.97–135).Attraction is repulsion, necessity bondage.The Great Mother’s main disciple is her son and lover, the dying god of NearEastern mystery religion. Neumann says of Attis, Adonis, Tammuz, and Osiris,“They are loved, slain, buried, and bewailed by her, and are then reborn throughher.” Maleness is merely a shadow whirled round in nature’s eternal cycle. Theboy gods are “phallic consorts of the Great Mother, drones serving the queenbee, who are killed off as soon as they have performed their duty offecundation.” Mother-love smothers what it embraces. The dying gods are“delicate blossoms, symbolized by the myths as anemones, narcissi, hyacinths, orviolets.”The youths, who personify the spring, belong to the Great Mother. They are herbondslaves, her property, because they are the sons she has borne. Consequentlythe chosen ministers and priests of the Mother Goddess are eunuchs…. For her,loving, dying, and being emasculated are the same thing.31[ch25_notes.html#ch02note31a]Masculinity flows from the Great Mother as an aspect of herself and is recalledand cancelled by her at will. Her son is a servant of her cult. There is nogoing beyond her. Motherhood blankets existence.The most brilliant perception of The Golden Bough, muted by prudence, isFrazer’s analogy between Jesus and the dying gods. The Christian ritual of deathand redemption is a survival of pagan mystery religion. Frazer says, “The type,created by Greek artists, of the sorrowful goddess with her dying lover in herarms, resembles and may have been the model of the Pietà of Christian art.”32[ch25_notes.html#ch02note32a] Early Christian and Byzantine Christs were virile,but once the Church settled in Rome, Italy’s vestigial paganism took over.Christ relapsed into Adonis. Michelangelo’s Pietà is one of the most popularworks of world art partly because of its pagan evocation of the archetypalmother-relation. Mary, with her unmarked maiden’s face, is the mother goddessever-young and ever-virgin. Jesus is remarkably epicene, with aristocratic handsand feet of morbid delicacy. Michelangelo’s androgynous dying god fuses sex andreligion in the pagan way. Grieving in her oppressive robes, Mary admires thesensual beauty of the son she has made. His glassy nude limbs slipping down herlap, Adonis sinks back to earth, his strength drained by and returned to hisimmortal mother.Freud says, “It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexualimpulse towards our mother.”33 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note33a] Incest is at thestart of all biography and cosmogony. The man who finds his true wife has foundhis mother. Male mastery in marriage is a social illusion, nurtured by womenexhorting their creations to play and walk. At the emotional heart of everymarriage is a pietà of mother and son. I will find traces of the archaic incestof mother-cults in Poe and James and in Tennessee Williams’ Suddenly LastSummer, where a queen mother, ruling a brutal primeval garden, marries herhomosexual aesthete son, who is ritually slain and mourned. Female dynamism isthe law of nature. Earth husbands herself.The residual paganism of western culture bursts out full flower in modern showbusiness. An odd phenomenon, over fifty years old, is the cultishness of malehomosexuals around female superstars. There is no equivalent taste amonglesbians, who as a group in America seem more interested in softball than artand artifice. The female superstar is a goddess, a universal mother-father.Cabaret parodies by female impersonators unerringly find the androgyny in thegreat stars. Mae West, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis, Eartha Kitt, CarolChanning, Barbra Streisand, Diana Ross, Joan Collins, Joan Rivers: all areself-exalting females of cold male will, with subtle sexual ambiguities ofmanner and look. Judy Garland inspired mob hysteria among male homosexuals.Media reports speak of uncanny shrieking, mass assaults on the stage, blindingshowers of bouquets. These were orgiastic eunuch rites at the shrine of thegoddess. Photos show posturing men making sensational entrances in Garland’sglittery costume, just like transvestite devotees of the ancient Great Mother.Such spectacles became rarer in the Seventies, when American homosexuals wentmacho. But I sense a return to imaginative sensibility among younger men.Cultishness still thrives among homosexual opera fans, whose supreme diva wastempestuous Maria Callas. I interpret this phenomenon, like pornography andperversion, as more evidence of men’s tendency toward sexual conceptualization,for me a biological faculty at the roots of art. One result of the diseaseclaiming so many lives is that homosexuals have been involuntarily rewed totheir shamanistic identity, fatal, sacrificial, outcast. To make sexual ideasout of reality, as they did in their fevered cult of the female star, is moreprofitable to culture than to act out such ideas in bar or bedroom. Art advancesby self-mutilation of the artist. The more negative homosexual experience, themore it belongs to art.Our first exhibit from western art is the so-called Venus of Willendorf, a tinystatuette (height 4⅜”) from the Old Stone Age found in Austria (fig. 2[ch02.html#ch02fig2]). In it we see all the strange laws of primitiveearth-cult. Woman is idol and object, goddess and prisoner. She is buried in thebulging mass of her own fecund body.The Venus of Willendorf is comically named, for she is unbeautiful by everystandard. But beauty has not yet emerged as a criterion for art. In the OldStone Age, art is magic, a ritual recreation of what-is-desired. Cave paintingswere not meant to be seen. Their beauty for us is incidental. Bison and reindeercrowd the walls, following rock ridges and grooves. Art was invocation, asummoning: mother nature, let herds return that man might eat. Caves were thebowels of the goddess, and art was a sexual scribbling, an impregnation. It hadrhythm and vitality but no visual status. The Venus of Willendorf, a cult-imagehalf-molded from a rough stone, is unbeautiful because art has not yet found itsrelation to the eye. Her fat is a symbol of abundance in an age of famine. Sheis the too-muchness of nature, which man longs to direct to his salvation.Image [../images/f0055-01.jpg]2. Venus of Willendorf, ca. 30,000 B.C.Venus of Willendorf carries her cave with her. She is blind, masked. Her ropesof corn-row hair look forward to the invention of agriculture. She has afurrowed brow. Her facelessness is the impersonality of primitive sex andreligion. There is no psychology or identity yet, because there is no society,no cohesion. Men cower and scatter at the blast of the elements. Venus ofWillendorf is eyeless because nature can be seen but not known. She is remoteeven as she kills and creates. The statuette, so overflowing and protuberant, isritually invisible. She stifles the eye. She is the cloud of archaic night.Bulging, bulbous, bubbling. Venus of Willendorf, bent over her own belly, tendsthe hot pot of nature. She is eternally pregnant. She broods, in all senses. Sheis hen, nest, egg. The Latin mater and materia, mother and matter, areetymologically connected. Venus of Willendorf is the nature-mother as primevalmuck, oozing into infant forms. She is female but not feminine. She is turgidwith primal force, swollen with great expectations. She has no feet. Placed onend, she would topple over. Woman is immobile, weighed down by her inflatedmounds of breast, belly, and buttock. Like Venus de Milo, Venus of Willendorfhas no arms. They are flat flippers scratched on the stone, unevolved, useless.She has no thumbs and therefore no tools. Unlike man, she can neither roam norbuild. She is a mountain that can be climbed but can never move.Venus is a solipsist, navel-gazing. Femaleness is self-referential andself-replicating. Delphi was called the omphalos or navel of the world, markedby a shapeless holy stone. A black meteorite, a primitive image of Cybele, wasbrought to Rome from Phrygia to save the city in the last Punic War. ThePalladium, a Zeus-sent image of Athena upon which Troy’s fate depended, wasprobably such a meteorite. Today, the Kaaba, the inner sanctuary of the GreatMosque of Mecca, enshrines a meteorite, the Black Stone, as the holiest relic ofIslam. The Venus of Willendorf is a kind of meteorite, a quirky found object,lumpish and mystic. The Delphic omphalos-stone was cone, womb, and beehive. Thebraided cap of Venus of Willendorf is hivelike—prefiguring the provocativebeehives of French court wigs and shellacked swinging-Sixties towers. Venusbuzzes to herself, queen for all days, woman for all seasons. She sleeps. She ishibernation and harvest, the turning wheel of the year. The egg-shaped Venusthinks in circles. Mind under matter.Sex, I said, is a descent to the nether realms, a daily sinking from sky-cult toearth-cult. It is abdominal, abominable, daemonic. Venus of Willendorf is goingdown, disappearing into her own labyrinth. She is a tuber, rooted from a pocketof earth. Kenneth Clark divides female nudes into the Vegetable and theCrystalline Aphrodite. Inert and self-communing, Venus of Willendorf representsthe obstacle of sex and vegetable nature. It is at her shrine that we worship inoral sex. In the bowels of the earth mother, we feel but do not think or see.Venus dwindles to a double pubic delta, knees clamped and cramped in the sharppelvic angle of the wide-hipped childbearing woman, which prevents her fromrunning with ease. Female jiggle is the ducklike waddle of our wallowingWillendorf, who swims in the underground river of liquid nature. Sex isprobings, plumbing, secretions, gushings. Venus is drowsing and dowsing,hearkening to the stirring in her sac of waters.Is the Venus of Willendorf just to female experience? Yes. Woman is trapped inher wavy, watery body. She must listen and learn from something beyond and yetwithin her. The Venus of Willendorf, blind, tongueless, brainless, armless,knock-kneed, seems a depressing model of gender. Yet woman is depressed, presseddown, by earth’s gravitation, calling us back to her bosom. We will see thatmalign magnetism at work in Michelangelo, one of his great themes andobsessions. In the west, art is a hacking away at nature’s excess. The westernmind makes definitions. That is, it draws lines. This is the heart ofApollonianism. There are no lines in the Venus of Willendorf, only curves andcircles. She is the formlessness of nature. She is mired in the miasmic swamp Iidentify with Dionysus. Life always begins and ends in squalor. The Venus ofWillendorf, slumping, slovenly, sluttish, is in a rut, the womb-tomb of mothernature. Never send to know for whom the belle tolls. She tolls for thee.How did beauty begin? Earth-cult, suppressing the eye, locks man in the belly ofmothers. There is, I insisted, nothing beautiful in nature. Nature is primalpower, coarse and turbulent. Beauty is our weapon against nature; by it we makeobjects, giving them limit, symmetry, proportion. Beauty halts and freezes themelting flux of nature.Beauty was made by men acting together. Hamlets, forts, cities spread across theNear East after the founding of Jericho (ca. 8000 B.C.), the first knownsettlement in the world. But it was not until Egypt that art broke itsenslavement to nature. High art is nonutilitarian. That is, the art object,though retaining its ritualism, is no longer a tool of something else. Beauty isthe art object’s license to life. The object exists on its own, godlike. Beautyis the art object’s light from within. We know it by the eye. Beauty is ourescape from the murky flesh-envelope that imprisons us.Egypt, making a state, made beauty. The reign of Chephren (fl. 2565 B.C.) gaveEgyptian art its supreme style, a tradition to last until the time of Christ(fig. 3 [ch02.html#ch02fig3]). Pharaoh was the state. The concentration of powerin one man, a living god, was a great cultural advance. A king’s emergence outof feuding tribal chieftains is always a step forward in history, as in themedieval era with its quarrelsome barons. Commerce, technology, and the artsprofit when nationalism wins over parochialism. Egypt, the first totalitarianrégime, made a mystique out of one-man rule. And in that mystique was the birthof the western eye.A king, ruling alone, is the head of state, as the people are the body. Pharaohis a wise eye, never blinking. He unifies the scattered many. The unification ofupper and lower Egypt, a geographical triumph, was man’s first experience ofconcentration, condensation, conceptualization. Social order and the idea ofsocial order emerge. Egypt is history’s first romance of hierarchy. Pharaoh,elevated and sublime, contemplated life’s panorama. His eye was the sun disk atthe apex of the social pyramid. He had point of view, an Apollonian sightline.Egypt invented the magic of image. The mystique of kingship had to be projectedover thousands of miles to keep the nation together. Conceptualization andprojection: in Egypt is forged the formalistic Apollonian line that will end inmodern cinema, master genre of our century. Egypt invented glamour, beauty aspower and power as beauty. Egyptian aristocrats were the first Beautiful People.Hierarchy and eroticism fused in Egypt, making a pagan unity the west has neverthrown off. The eros of hierarchical orders, separate but mutually intrusive, isone of the west’s most characteristic perversions, later intensified by theChristian taboo upon sex. Egypt makes personality and history numinous. Thisidea, entering Europe through Greece, remains the principal distinction betweenwestern and eastern culture.Image [../images/f0058-01.jpg]3. Chephren, from the pyramid complex at Giza, ca. 2500 B.C.A black line on a white page. The Nile, cutting through the desert, was thefirst straight line in western culture. Egypt discovered linearity, a phallictrack of mind piercing the entanglements of nature. The thirty royal dynastiesof Egypt were the cascading river of history. Ancient Egypt was a thin band ofcultivated land an average of five miles wide but six hundred miles long. Anabsolutist geography produced an absolutist politics and aesthetics. At itsheight in the Old Kingdom, pharaonic power created the pyramid, a mammoth designof converging lines. At Giza are remnants of the elevated causeway leading upfrom the Nile past the Great Sphinx to the pyramid of Chephren. Long causeways,for construction crews and religious processions, were highways into history.Egyptian linearity cut the knot of nature; it was the eye shot forward into thefar distance.The masculine art form of construction begins in Egypt. There were public worksbefore, as in the fabled walls of Jericho, but they did not cater to the eye. InEgypt, construction is male geometry, a glorification of the visible. The firstclarity of intelligible form appears in Egypt, the basis of Greek Apollonianismin art and thought. Egypt discovers foursquare architecture, a rigid grid laidagainst mother nature’s melting ovals. Social order becomes a visible aesthetic,countering nature’s chthonian invisibilities. Pharaonic construction is theperfection of matter in art. Fascist political power, grandiose andself-divinizing, creates the hierarchical, categorical superstructure of westernmind. Pyramids are man-mountains to rival nature, ladders to the sun ofsky-cult. Colossalism, monumentality. The ideal human figure in Egypt is apillar, an element of architecture and geometry. The gigantism of procreativenature has been masculinized and hardened. Egypt had little wood but lots ofstone. Stone makes an art of permanence. The body is an obelisk, square,phallic, sky-pointing, an Apollonian line defying time and organic change.Egyptian art is glyptic, that is, carved or engraved. It is based on the incisededge, which I identify as the Apollonian element in western culture. Stone isobdurate, unregenerate nature. The incised edge is the line drawn between natureand culture. It is the steely autograph of the western will. We will find thesharp Apollonian contour in psychology as well as art. Western personality ishard, impermeable, intractable. Spengler says “the brilliant polish of the stonein Egyptian art” makes the eye “glide” along the statue surface.34[ch25_notes.html#ch02note34a] The west’s armoured ego begins in the shiny stoneidealizations of Old Kingdom Pharaohs, objets d’art and objets de culte. Thegreen diorite statue of enthroned Chephren from Giza is a masterpiece of smooth,glossy, Apollonian definitiveness. Its hardness of surface repels the eye. Thismasculine hardness is an abolition of female interiority. There are no warmwomb-spaces in aristocratic Egyptian art. The body is a shaft of frozenApollonian will. The flatness of Egyptian wall-painting and relief serves thesame function, obliterating woman’s inner darkness. Every angle of the body iscrisp, clean, and sunlit. Sagging maternal breasts of the Willendorf kindusually appear, oddly enough, only on male fertility gods like Hapi, the Nilegod. Egypt is the first to glamourize small breasts. The breast as vernaladornment rather than rubbery milk sac, outline rather than volume: ApollonianEgypt made the first shift of value from femaleness to femininity, an advancederotic art form.Chthonian internality, as we shall see, was projected into the world of thedead. But Egypt also translated inner space into entirely social terms. Egyptinvented interior décor, civilized living; it made beauty out of social life.The Egyptians were the first aesthetes. An aesthete does not necessarily dresswell or collect art works: an aesthete is one who lives by the eye. TheEgyptians had “taste.” Taste is Apollonian discrimination, judgment,connoisseurship; taste is the visible logic of objects. Arnold Hauser says ofthe Middle Kingdom, “The stiffly ceremonial forms of courtly art are absolutelynew and come into prominence here for the first time in the history of humanculture.”35 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note35a] The Egyptians lived by ceremony; theyritualized social life. The aristocratic house was a cool, airy temple ofharmony and grace; the minor arts had unparalleled quality of design. Jewelry,makeup, costume, chairs, tables, cabinets: from the moment Egyptian style wasrediscovered by Napoleon’s invaders, it has been the rage in Europe and America,influencing fashion, furniture, and tombstones and even producing the WashingtonMonument. Artifacts from other Near Eastern cultures—the golden bull’s lyre fromUr, for example—seem cluttered, bulky, muscle-bound. In their cult of the eye,the Egyptians saw edges. Even their stylized gestures in art have a superbballetic contour. The Egyptians invented elegance. Elegance is reduction,simplification, condensation. It is spare, stark, sleek. Elegance is cultivatedabstraction. The source of Greek and Roman classicism—clarity, order,proportion, balance—is in Egypt.Egypt remains unabsorbed by humanistic education. Though its art and history aretaught, it is taken far less seriously than Greece. The thinness of Egyptianliterature keeps it out of core curricula. The superstition of Egyptian religionrepels the rational, and the autocracy of Egyptian politics repels the liberal.But Egypt’s power to fascinate endures, alluring poets, artists, actresses, andfanatics. Egyptian high culture was more complex and conceptual than has beenacknowledged. It is underestimated because of the moralistic obsession withlanguage that has dominated modern academic thought. Words are not the onlymeasure of mental development. To believe that they are is a very western orJudeo-Christian illusion. It stems from our invisible God, who talks creationinto existence. Words are the most removed of human inventions fromthings-as-they-are. The most ancient conflict in western culture, between Jewand Egyptian, continues today: Hebrew word-worship versus pagan imagism, thegreat unseen versus the glorified thing. The Egyptians were visionarymaterialists. They began the western line of Apollonian aestheticism that we seein the Iliad, in Pheidias, Botticelli, Spenser, Ingres, Wilde, and Hollywoodcinema. Apollonian things are the cold western eye cut out of nature.Egyptian culture flourished relatively unchanged for three thousand years, farlonger than Greek culture. Stagnancy, a stultifying lack of individualism, saysthe humanist. But Egyptian culture lasted because it was stable and complete. Itworked. The Apollonian element in Egypt is so pronounced that the idea of“classical” antiquity should be revised to contain it. Egypt and the ancientNear East were also the source of the Dionysian countercurrent in Greek culture.In Greece Apollo and Dionysus were at odds, but in Egypt they were reconciled.Egyptian culture was a fusion of the conceptual with the chthonian, theform-making of consciousness with the shadowy flux of procreative nature. Dayand night were equally honored. Here alone in the world were sky-cult andearth-cult yoked and harmonized.Fertility religion always comes first in history. But as the food problem issolved, nature’s moral and aesthetic incoherence gradually becomes apparent.Egypt evolved into the sun-worship of sky-cult without ever losing itsorientation toward the earth. This was because of the Nile, center of theEgyptian economy. Each year the river flooded and receded, leaving a plain ofrich black mud; each year the hard went soft, earth turned liquid. John Readsays alchemy probably began in Egypt, since Khem was the ancient name of Egypt,“the country of dark soil, the Biblical Land of Ham.”36[ch25_notes.html#ch02note36a] Metamorphosis is the chthonian magic ofshapeshifting Dionysus. The fertile muck was the primeval matrix, with whichEgyptians came into annual contact. The Apollonian is chaste contour,borderlines: the Nile, transgressing its borders with majestic regularity, wasthe triumph of mother nature. Egypt’s ideology of sun and stone rested onchthonian ooze, the swamp of generation I identify with Dionysus. Theoscillations of the Egyptian calendar produced a fruitful duality of point ofview, one of the greatest constructs of western imagination.Chthonian mysteries are the secret of Egypt’s perennial fascination. The grossand barbaric proliferated. A dung-beetle, the scarab, was worshipped and worn asa gemstone. The scarab was minister of nature’s decay, the bath of dissolution.Egyptian literature was undeveloped because internality was preempted by thedeath-cult. There was only one ethical principle, justice (maat), a publicvirtue above ground or below. Spirituality was projected into the afterlife. TheBook of the Dead was daemonic thought, ruminations, earth-chawings. The mummy,swaddled like an infant, returned to nature’s womb for rebirth. The painted tombwas cave art, prayers to daemonic darkness. Egyptian culture was bothearth-tending and earth-rejecting. Herodotus reports Egyptian men urinated likewomen. Egyptian gods were incompletely emerged from prehistoric animism. Theywere monstrous hybrids, half human and half animal or animal joined to animal.E. A. Wallis Budge says the Egyptians clung to their “composite creatures”despite the ridicule of foreigners.37 [ch25_notes.html#ch02note37a] One god hada serpent head on a leopard body, another a hawk head on the body of a lion andhorse; still another was a crocodile with the body of a lion and hippopotamus.Chthonian energy, like the Nile, is overflow and superfetation. The logic andrigor of the Apollonian eye had to defeat Egypt’s fuzzy tribal fetishism.The Egyptian synthesis of chthonian and Apollonian was of enormous consequencefor western tradition. It was in the interplay between earth and sky thatidealized form began. Western personality is an Egyptian objet d’art, anexclusive zone of aristocratic privilege. The cartouche, a closed oval,surrounds a hieroglyphic name. In early Egyptian art, a serekh or square palacefacade signified kingship. Cartouche and serekh are symbols of hierarchicsequestration, a closing in of the holy and royal to exclude the profane. Theyare a temenos, the Greek word for the sacred precinct around a temple. Thereserved space of the cartouche is analogous to the wedjat, the apotropaic eyeof Horus studding so many amulets and hieroglyphic displays (fig. 4[ch02.html#ch02fig4]). The Egyptian eye is synonymous with western personality.Because the soul was thought to reside there, the eye is always shown full face,flounderlike, even when the head is in painted profile. The eye is licensed inEgypt. That is, it is released but ritually bound. The glamourous black-tailedoutline of Egyptian eye-makeup is a hieratic accent, both fish and fence. Itcontains and blocks out. Egypt honored the earth but also feared it. The pure,clean Apollonian contour of Egyptian art is a defense against chthonian muck andmuddle. Egypt created the distance between eye and object which is a hallmark ofwestern philosophy and aesthetics. That distance is a charged force field, adangerous temenos. Egypt created Apollonian objects out of chthonian fear. Thewestern line of Apollonian thing-making, from Homer’s bronzed warriors tocapitalist cars and cans, begins in the Egyptian caged eye.Image [../images/f0063-01.jpg]4. Stele of the Overseer of Magazine of Amon, Nib-Amun, and his wife, Huy,Eighteenth Dynasty.One of the most misunderstood features of Egyptian life was the veneration ofcats, whose mummified bodies have been found by the thousands. My theory is thatthe cat was the model for Egypt’s unique synthesis of principles (fig. 5[ch02.html#ch02fig5]). The modern cat, the last animal domesticated by man,descends from Felis lybica, a North African wildcat. Cats are prowlers, uncannycreatures of the night. Cruelty and play are one for them. They live by and forfear, practicing being scared or spooking humans by sudden rushings andambushes. Cats dwell in the occult, that is, the “hidden.” In the Middle Ages,they were hunted and killed for their association with witches. Unfair? But thecat really is in league with chthonian nature, Christianity’s mortal enemy. Theblack cat of Halloween is the lingering shadow of archaic night. Sleeping up totwenty of every twenty-four hours, cats reconstruct and inhabit the primitivenight-world. The cat is telepathic—or at least thinks that it is. Many peopleare unnerved by its cool stare. Compared to dogs, slavishly eager to please,cats are autocrats of naked self-interest. They are both amoral and immoral,consciously breaking rules. Their “evil” look at such times is no humanprojection: the cat may be the only animal who savors the perverse or reflectsupon it.Thus the cat is an adept of chthonian mysteries. But it has a hieratic duality.It is eye-intense. The cat fuses the Gorgon eye of appetite to the detachedApollonian eye of contemplation. The cat values invisibility, comicallyimagining itself undetectable as it slouches across a lawn. But it alsofashionably loves to see and be seen; it is a spectator of life’s drama, amused,condescending. It is a narcissist, always adjusting its appearance. When it isdisheveled, its spirits fall. Cats have a sense of pictorial composition: theystation themselves symmetrically on chairs, rugs, even a sheet of paper on thefloor. Cats adhere to an Apollonian metric of mathematical space. Haughty,solitary, precise, they are arbiters of elegance—that principle I find nativelyEgyptian.Image [../images/f0065-01.jpg]5. Cat Goddess with One Gold Earring, Late Dynastic.Cats are poseurs. They have a sense of persona—and become visibly embarrassedwhen reality punctures their dignity. Apes are more human but less beautiful:they posture but never pose. Hunkering, chattering, chest-beating,buttock-baring, apes are bumptious vulgarians lurching up the evolutionary road.The cat’s sophisticated personae are masks of an advanced theatricality. Priestand god of its own cult, the cat follows a code of ritual purity, cleaningitself religiously. It makes pagan sacrifices to itself and may share itsceremonies with the elect. The day of a cat-owner often begins with thediscovery of a neat pile of mole guts or mashed mouse limbs on theporch—Darwinian mementos. The cat is the least Christian inhabitant of theaverage home.In Egypt the cat; in Greece the horse. The Greeks did not care for cats. Theyadmired the horse and used it constantly in art and metaphor. The horse is anathlete, proud but serviceable. It accepts citizenship in a public system. Thecat is a law unto itself. It has never lost its despotic air of Oriental luxuryand indolence. It was too feminine for the male-loving Greeks. I spoke ofEgypt’s invention of femininity, an aesthetic of social practice removed fromnature’s brutal female machinery. Aristocratic Egyptian women’s costume, anexquisite tunic of transparent pleated linen, must be called slinky, a word westill use for formfitting evening gowns. Slinkiness is the nocturnal stealth ofcats. The Egyptians admired sleekness, in greyhounds, jackals, and hawks.Sleekness is smooth Apollonian contour. But slinkiness is the sinuous craft ofdaemonic darkness, which the cat carries into day.Cats have secret thoughts, a divided consciousness. No other animal is capableof ambivalence, those ambiguous cross-currents of feeling, as when a purring catsimultaneously buries its teeth warningly in one’s arm. The inner drama of alounging cat is telegraphed by its ears, which swerve round toward a distantrustle as its eyes rest with false adoration on ours, and secondly by its tail,which flicks menacingly even while the cat dozes. Sometimes the cat pretends tohave no relation to its own tail, which it schizophrenically attacks. Thetwitching, thumping tail is the chthonian barometer of the cat’s Apollonianworld. It is the serpent in the garden, bumping and grinding with maliceaforethought. The cat’s ambivalent duality is dramatized in erratic mood-swings,abrupt leaps from torpor to mania, by which it checks our presumption: “Come nocloser. I can never be known.”Thus the Egyptian veneration of cats was neither silly nor childish. Through thecat, Egypt defined and refined its complex aesthetic. The cat was the symbol ofthat fusion of chthonian and Apollonian which no other culture achieved. Thewest’s eye-intense pagan line begins in Egypt, as does the hard persona of artand politics. Cats are exemplars of both. The crocodile, also honored in Egypt,resembles the cat in its daily passage between two realms: hefting itselfbetween water and earth, the spiky crocodile is the west’s armoured ego,sinister, hostile, and ever-watchful. The cat is a time-traveller from ancientEgypt. It returns whenever sorcery or style is in vogue. In the Decadentaestheticism of Poe and Baudelaire, the cat regains its sphinxlike prestige andmagnitude. With its taste for ritual and bloody spectacle, conspiracy andexhibitionism, the cat is pure pagan pomp. Uniting nocturnal primitivism toApollonian elegance of line, it became the living paradigm of Egyptiansensibility. The cat, fixing its swift predatory energy in poses of Apollonianstasis, was the first to enact the frozen moment of perceptual stillness that ishigh art.Our second exhibit from western art is the bust of Nefertiti (figs. 6[ch02.html#ch02fig6] and 7 [ch02.html#ch02fig7]). How familiar it is, and yethow strange. Nefertiti is the opposite of the Venus of Willendorf. She is thetriumph of Apollonian image over the humpiness and horror of mother earth.Everything fat, slack, and sleepy is gone. The western eye is open and alert. Ithas forced objects into their frozen frame. But the liberation of the eye hasits price. Taut, still, and truncated, Nefertiti is western ego under glass. Theradiant glamour of this supreme sexual persona comes to us from a palace-prison,the overdeveloped brain. Western culture, moving up toward Apollonian sunlight,discards one burden only to stagger under another.Image [../images/f0067-01.jpg]6. Nefertiti (copy).The bust, found by a German expedition at Amarna in 1912, dates from the reignof Akhenaten (1375–57 B.C.). Queen Nefertiti, wife of the Pharaoh, wears awig-crown peculiar to the eighteenth dynasty and seen elsewhere only onAkhenaten’s formidable mother, Queen Tiy. The bust is painted limestone withplaster additions; the eye is inset rock crystal. The ears and uraeus, the royalserpent. on the brow, are broken. Scholars have debated whether the piece is astudio model for court artists.The Nefertiti bust is one of the most popular art works in the world. It isprinted on scarves and molded in necklace pendants and coffee-table miniatures.But never in my experience is the bust exactly reproduced. The copyist softensit, feminizes and humanizes it. The actual bust is intolerably severe. It is toouncanny an object for domestic display. Even art books lie. The bust is usuallyposed in profile or at an angle, so that the missing left pupil is hidden orshadowed. What happened to the eye? Perhaps it was unnecessary in a model andnever inserted. But the eye was often chiseled out of statues and paintings ofthe dead. It was a way of making a hated rival a nonperson and extinguishing hisor her survival in the afterlife. Akhenaten’s reign was divisive. His creationof a new capital and efforts to crush the powerful priesthood, his establishmentof monotheism and innovations in artistic style were nullified under hisson-in-law, Tutankhamen, the short-lived boy-king. Nefertiti may have lost hereye in the wreck of the eighteenth dynasty.Image [../images/f0068-01.jpg]7. Nefertiti, ca. 1350 B.C.As we have it, the bust of Nefertiti is artistically and ritualisticallycomplete, exalted, harsh, and alien. It fuses the naturalism of the Amarnaperiod with the hieratic formalism of Egyptian tradition. But Amarnaexpressiveness ends in the grotesque. This is the least consoling of great artworks. Its popularity is based on misunderstanding and suppression of its uniquefeatures. The proper response to the Nefertiti bust is fear. The queen is anandroid, a manufactured being. She is a new gorgoneion, a “bodiless head offright.” She is paralyzed and paralyzing. Like enthroned Chephren, Nefertiti issuave, urbane. She gazes toward the far distance, seeing what is best for herpeople. But her eyes, with their catlike rim of kohl, are cold. She isself-divinized authority. Art shows Akhenaten half-feminine, his limbs shrunkenand belly bulging, possibly from birth defect or disease. This portrait showshis queen half-masculine, a vampire of political will. Her seductive force bothlures in and warns away. She is western personality barricaded behind itsaching, icy line of Apollonian identity.Nefertiti’s head is so massive it threatens to snap the neck like a stalk. Sheis like a papyrus blossom swaying on its river reed. The head is swollen to thepoint of deformity. She seems futuristic, with the enlarged cerebrum foreseen asthe destiny of our species. The crown is filled like a funnel with a rain ofhierarchic energy, flooding the fragile brain-pan and violently pushing the faceforward like the prow of a ship. Nefertiti is like the Winged Victory ofSamothrace, garments plastered back by the wind of history. As cargo, Nefertiticarries her own excess of thought. She is weighed down by Apollonianwakefulness, a sun that never sets. Egypt invented the pillar, which Greecewould refine. With her slim aristocratic neck, Nefertiti is a pillar, acaryatid. She bears the burden of state upon her head, rafters of the temple ofthe sun. The golden brow-band is a ritual bridle, squeezing, constricting,limiting. Nefertiti presides from the temenos of power, a sacred precinct shecan never leave.Venus of Willendorf is all body, Nefertiti all head. Her shoulders have been cutaway by radical surgery. Early in its history, Egypt invented the bust, aportrait style still in use. It may have been a robust double, the ka thatenters and exits through false doors. The shoulders of the Nefertiti bust haveshriveled to become their own pedestal. No physical force remains. The queen’sbody is bound and invisible, like a mummy. Her face gleams with the newness ofrebirth. Tense with self-creation, she is a goddess as mother-father. Thepregnancy of Venus of Willendorf is displaced upward and redefined. Willendorfis chthonian belly-magic, Nefertiti Apollonian head-magic. Thinking makes it so.Nefertiti is a royal highness, propelling herself like a jet into sky-cult.Forward thrust. Nefertiti leads with her chin. She has “great bones.” She isEgyptian stone architecture, just as Venus of Willendorf is earthen ovals, womanas quivering poached egg. Nefertiti is femaleness made mathematical, femalenesssublimized by becoming harder and more concrete.I said Egypt invented elegance, which is reduction, simplification,condensation. Mother nature is addition and multiplication, but Nefertiti issubtraction. Visually, she has been reduced to her essence. Her sleek contouredface is one step from the wizened. She is abbreviation, a symbol or pictogram, apure idea of pagan pictorialism. One can never be too rich or too thin, decreedthe Duchess of Windsor. I said the idea of beauty is based on enormousexclusions. So much is excluded from the Nefertiti bust that we can feel itssilhouette straining against the charged atmosphere, a combat of Apollonianline. The name Nefertiti means “The Beautiful One Cometh.” Her haughty face iscarved out of the chaos of nature. Beauty is a state of war, a frigid blank zoneunder siege.Nefertiti is ritualized western personality, a streamlined thing. She isforbiddingly clean. Her eyebrows are shaved and redrawn with male width andfrown. She is as depilated as a priest. She has the face of a mannequin, static,posed, self-proffering. Her knowingness is both fashionable and hieratic. Themodern mannequin of window or runway is an androgyne, because she is femalenessimpersonalized by masculine abstraction. If a studio model, the Nefertiti bustis as much a mannequin as the royal dummy of a London tailor shop. As queen andmannequin, Nefertiti is both exposed and enclosed, a face and a mask. She isnaked yet armoured, experienced yet ritually pure. She is sexuallyunapproachable because bodiless: her torso is gone; her full lips invite butremain firmly pressed together. Her perfection is for display, not for use.Akhenaten and his queen would greet their court from a balcony, the “window ofappearance.” All art is a window of appearance. Nefertiti’s face is the sun ofconsciousness rising over a new horizon, the frame or mathematical grid of man’svictory over nature. The idolatrous thingness of western art is a theft ofauthority from mother nature.Nefertiti’s mismatched eyes, deliberate or accidental, are a symbol of Egyptianduality. Like the cat, she sees in and sees out. She is frozen Apollonian poseurand Gorgonesque daemonic seer. The Greek Graiai, three old divine sisters, hadone eye that they passed from hand to hand. Fontenrose connects this to thedouble pupil of a Lydian queen: “What she had, it seems to me, was a removableeye of wondrous power. It was an eye that could penetrate the invisible.”38[ch25_notes.html#ch02note38a] Nefertiti, the half-blind mannequin, sees more bybeing less. Mutilation is mystic expansion. Modern copyists suppress the missingeye because it is fatal to popular canons of beauty. Maimed eyes seem mad orspectral, as in the veiled vulture’s eye of Poe’s Tell-Tale Heart. Nefertiti isa mutant and visionary materialist, a thing that sees. In Egypt, matter is madenuminous by the first electricity of mind. In the Egyptian cult of seeing,Nefertiti is thought in flight from its origins.From Venus of Willendorf to Nefertiti: from body to face, touch to sight, loveto judgment, nature to society. Nefertiti is like Athena born from the brow ofZeus, a head-heavy armoured goddess. She is beautiful but desexed. She ishieratic decorum and reserve, her head literally a reservoir of containment andcurtailment, like her stunted torso. Her ponderous, ostentatious crown is thecold breeding ground of Greek categorical thought. Her tight brow-band isstringency, rigor, channeled ideas. The miasmic cloud of mother nature haslifted. Nefertiti’s imperious jutting face is the cutting edge of westernconceptualization and projection. In her profile, all roads lead to the eye.From the side, diagonals converge in peaking vectors of force. From the front,she rears up like a cobra head, woman as royal intimidator. She is theeye-intense west, the overenlargement and grandiosity of head-culture. The bustof Nefertiti is eye-pleasing but oppressive. It looks forward to Bellini’sandrogynous Doge Loredan, to Neapolitan silver reliquary busts, to Fiftiesfantasy drawings of smiling armless women in chic evening gowns. Authority, goodwill, aloofness, asceticism. Epiphany as a totem of vibrating passivity. Withher welcoming but uncanny smile, Nefertiti is western personality in its ritualbonds. Exquisite and artificial, she is mind-made image forever caught inradiant Apollonian freezeframe."},{"pageContent":"3APOLLO AND DIONYSUSThe Greek gods are sharp personalities, interacting in dramatic space. Theirvisualization was first achieved by blind Homer, in his epic arcs of cinematiclight. Homer’s conceptions were confirmed by Pheidias, the great sculptor ofhigh classic Athens, from which came the cold white monoliths of Roman art andarchitecture.In Egypt, sky-cult and earth-cult were harmonized, but in Greece there is asplit. Greek greatness is Apollonian. The gods live on a peak touching the sky.Olympus and Parnassus are mountain shrines of creative power spurning the earth.In that swerve upward is the sublime conceptualism of western intellect and art.Egypt gave Greece the pillar and monumental sculpture, which Greece turns fromPharaoh to kouros, from divine king to divine boy. Hidden in these gifts layEgypt’s Apollonianism, which Greek artists so splendidly develop. The orderlymathematic of the Doric temple is an orchestration of Egyptian ideas. Pheidiasbrings person and building together on the Acropolis or High City, Athens’ magicmountain. Egypt invented clarity of image, the essence of Apollonianism. FromOld Kingdom Pharaohs to Pheidias is two thousand years but one step in thehistory of art. Greek sky-cult is an Egyptian colonnade of stony things, thehard, harsh blocks of western personality.In Judeo-Christianity man is made in God’s image, but in Greek religion God ismade in man’s image. The Greek gods have a higher human beauty, their fleshincorruptible yet sensual. Greece, unlike Egypt, never worshipped beast gods.Greek sky-cult kept nature in her place. The visibility of the Greek gods isintellectual, symbolizing mind’s victory over matter. Art, a glorification ofmatter, wins its independence in the gods’ perfection. We know the name of noartist before signed Archaic pottery of sixth-century Greece. The artist inEgypt was merely an anonymous artisan, which he became again in Rome and theMiddle Ages. Judaism repressed art and the artist, reserving creativity for itsfabricator God. The Greek gods, well-made but not making, float like goldensolids in air.Jane Harrison calls the Olympians “objets d’art.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note1a]Their brilliant clarity and glittering chastity of form are Apollonian. Inpsychology, philosophy, and art, classical Greek imagination sought, in EduardFraenkel’s words, “λóγος, ratio… the intelligible, determinate, mensurable, asopposed to the fantastic, vague, and shapeless.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note2a]The Apollonian, I said, is the line drawn against nature. For Harrison, theOlympian gods are patriarchal betrayers of earth-cult and mother nature. Thechthonian is her test of authenticity and spiritual value. But I say there isneither person, thought, thing, nor art in the brutal chthonian. It was,ironically, the west’s Apollonian line that produced the matchless JaneHarrison.Nietzsche calls Apollo “the marvellous divine image of the principiumindividuationis,” “god of individuation and just boundaries.”3[ch25_notes.html#ch03note3a] The Apollonian borderline separates demes,districts, ideas, persons. Western individuation is Apollonian. The western egois finite, articulated, visible. Apollo is the integrity and unity of westernpersonality, a firm-outlined shape of sculptural definitiveness. Apollo laysdown the law. W. K. C. Guthrie says, “Apollo was first and foremost the patronof the legal or statutory aspect of religion.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note4a]Apollo links society and religion. He is fabricated form. He is exclusion andexclusiveness. I will argue that the Olympians as objets d’art symbolize socialorder. Roger Hinks says: “Olympian religion is essentially a religion of thesuccessful, comfortable, and healthy ruling-class. The downtrodden peasant,harassed by the necessities of keeping body and soul together in a naturallyunfruitful land, crippled by debt and social injustice, asked something verydifferent of his gods: the Olympians bore a discouraging resemblance to hisoppressors.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note5a] Aristocracy is aboveness. TheOlympians are authoritarian and repressive. What they repress is the monstrousgigantism of chthonian nature, that murky night-world from which society must bereclaimed day by day.Greek art transformed Apollo from the virile bearded god to a beautiful youngman or ephebe. He was once a wolf god: Apollo Lukeios, the Wolfish Apollo, gavehis name to the academic Lyceum, literally “Place of Wolves.” Apollo’swolfishness survives in his severity and austerity, his Doric plainness andrigor. The Dorians, who invaded Greece from the north in the twelfth centuryB.C., may have been blonde, recalled in Homer’s red-haired Menelaus. I thinkApollonian light turned again into blondeness, one of Europe’s racist motifs,glamourized in Botticelli and the Apollonian Faerie Queene. Blondeness isApollo’s wolfish coldness and conceptualism. It made its mark on our century inHitler’s homoerotic Aryanism and in the icy eye-spear of black and whiteApollonian cinema. By the early fifth century, Greek art purged both chthonianand single-sex elements from the major Olympians. Only the brothers Zeus andPoseidon retained their full beards and burly torsos. The ephebic androgyny ofthe high classic Apollo turned into effeminacy in Hellenistic art.Apollo’s latent transsexualism is partly evident in his connection to his twinsister, Artemis. Mythological twins are normally male, as in battling brothersfrom Egyptian Set and Osiris to Lewis Carroll’s Tweedledum and Tweedledee.Apollo and Artemis represent not conflict but consonance. They are mirrorimages, male and female versions of one personality, a motif not returning untilthe incestuous brother-sister pairs of Romanticism. The fraternal androgynesApollo and Artemis are, with Athena, the most militant of Olympians in the waragainst chthonian nature. Jane Harrison resents their twinship, deriving their“barren relation of sister and brother” from the early hierarchy of Great Motherover son-lover.6 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note6a]Artemis thwarts the gross fecundities of earth-cult. Euripides’ Hippolytus, hercelibate devotee, is destroyed by jealous Aphrodite, who unleashes the monstersof chthonian nature. Walter Otto calls Apollo and Artemis “the most sublime ofthe Greek gods,” distinguished by their “purity and holiness,” the root meaningof the name Phoebus: “In both deities there is something mysterious andunapproachable, something that commands an awed distance. As archers they shootunerringly and unseen from afar.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note7a] The coldness ofApollo and Artemis is so intense it burns like fire. Apollo’s amours are latefables. At his most characteristic, as on the temple pediment at Olympia, hestands alone (fig. 8 [ch03.html#ch03fig8]). Artemis is pre-Christian chastity,overlooked by those who stereotyped paganism as sexual license. Her supposedinfatuation with Endymion belongs to the moon goddess Selene, with whom she wasfalsely identified in the Hellenistic era. Moon worship is Near Eastern, notGreek. Like her twin, Artemis is a beam of blinding Apollonian daylight.The Greeks popularly connected Artemis’ name, which has no apparent Greek root,with artamos, “slaughterer, butcher.” Early Artemis was Potnia Theron, the dreadMistress of the Beasts, as the Iliad calls her. Archaic art shows her standingbetween heraldic animals, which she strangles with each hand. She rules them andshe slays them. A remnant of Proto-Artemis survived in the Ephesian Artemis,whose temple in Asia Minor was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world(fig. 9 [ch03.html#ch03fig9]). It was to the great port of Ephesus that St. Paultravelled with Mary, who died there. The Madonna is a spiritual correction ofEphesian Artemis, symbol of animal nature. A copy of the idol was brought toRome to stand in the Temple of Diana on the Aventine Hill. Its mummiform torsois covered with bull testicles or breasts in canine profusion. Ephesian Artemisis the swarming hive of mother nature, that heavy apple tree foaming with fruitwhich I found, in human terms, so repellent.Image [../images/f0075-01.jpg]8. Apollo and the Combat of Centaurs and Lapiths (detail), from the westpediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, 465–457 B.C.Image [../images/f0076-01.jpg]9. Ephesian Artemis. Imperial Roman statue of Hellenistic design.The descent of Artemis the huntress from the Great Mother accounts for thepuzzling fact that she, a virgin, rules over childbirth and is invoked by womenin labor. The Greek Artemis substitutes androgynous twinship for the AsianArtemis’ androgynous fecundity. Hellenistic art gradually merged the faces andgenders of brother and sister. The Greek Artemis is a sexual persona, aprojected personality. The narrowest of the major Olympians, she is acondensation of their Apollonian character. She is rigidly visible. Artemis’mystique of virginity is very western. Indeed, her sexual absolutism makes herone of the most western of personae, for which there is no counterpart in othercultures. Chastity is visibility in Artemis. Her superb authority as a femalepersona comes from her resistance to nature’s sexual flux. Her cleanliness ofcontour is the bold line of pagan pictorialism.Artemis is the Amazon of Olympus. Amazon legends were pre-Homeric. Theseus, itwas said, drove off an Amazon invasion from Athens, with the Areopagus the siteof victory and the women’s encampment afterward called the Amazonium. The battleof Greeks and Amazons was one of the great themes of Greek art, as on thewestern metope of the Parthenon. The Amazonomachia, or Amazon contest,symbolized the struggle of civilization against barbarism. It was used as ametaphor for the Persian Wars, rarely otherwise documented in survivingmonuments. Perhaps there was malicious humor in portraying the effete Persiansas masculine women. The Amazons may have been beardless Asian males with braidedhair who from a distance appeared to be women. The Amazon homeland was Scythia,the Black Sea region of southern Russia later linked with sexually ambiguousshamans. Until the fifth century B.C., when they donned the short tunic ofrunner and huntress, Amazons appeared in Greek art in Scythian trousers, boots,and Phrygian cap.Controversy continues about whether the Amazons were historical or mythical.Bodies of women in armour have been unearthed in Germany and Russia, but thereis still no evidence of autonomous female military units. The Greeks derived thename Amazon from amazos, “breastless.” The Amazon was said to cut or pinch offher right breast to draw the bowstring. This etymology may have been invented toexplain a word which was in fact amaza, “without barley bread” (cognate with“matzoh,” unleavened bread). The persistent motif of the amputated breast may beconnected to breast-amputation in rites of the great goddesses of Asia Minor.One theory about Ephesian Artemis was that she was strung with garlands ofsacrificed breasts. Amazons were the legendary founders of both the city andtemple of Ephesus.Many have wondered why Greek art never shows the Amazon with breast cut off. Myanswer is that deformity or mutilation of any kind was contrary to theidealizing classical imagination and the hyperdeveloped Greek sense of form.True or false, the tale illustrates the Greek view of the Amazon as anandrogyne. Breast-amputation, as in Lady Macbeth’s desire to “unsex” herself, isequivalent to male castration. The Amazon’s torso is half male, half female. Thesame idea appears in depictions of the Amazon with one breast bared. The greatGreek sculptors competitively tackled the theme Dying Amazon, where the warriorlifts one arm above her chest wound. Vergil’s Amazon Camilla is slain by ajavelin beneath the exposed breast. The Amazonian motif recurs in Delacroix’sLiberty Leading the People, where a flag-waving citizeness with one breast bareleaps the barricades. Amazonian exposure of the breast paradoxicallydesexualizes.Greek epithets illustrate the Amazon’s ferocity. She is called megathumos,dauntless, fearless; mnesimache, war-lustful; anandros, living without men;styganor, man-hating; androdamas, mansubduing; kreobotos, flesh-devouring;androdaiktos, androktonos, deianeira, manmurdering. Amazons are at eternal warwith men. Their defeat prefigured the absolute power of husband over wife inclassical Athens, where women had no civil rights. Greek art never shows theAmazon as a hulking Gorgon. She gained grace and dramatic dignity through thecode of arete, the Greek quest for honor and fame. The Amazon was latervulgarized by sex. Ovid makes her a woman of fanatical sexual refusal laid lowby man’s phallic sword. Pope uses the idea in The Rape of the Lock, wherespiteful Amazons make a drawing-room charge on a pack of foppish beaux. TheAmazon’s sole moment of real distinction after Greek art is in Renaissance epic,in the woman warriors of Boiardo, Ariosto, Tasso, and Spenser. But as we shallsee, the English Renaissance too subdued the Amazon to social frames ofreference.The Amazon is woman in groups, a myth of female bonding. Artemis is theAmazonian will in solitary self-communing. She is pure Apollonian ego, glintingwith the hostile separatism of western personae. She is assertion andaggression, followed by withdrawal and purification through self-sequestration.Artemis needs an Apollonian imagination like Spenser’s to do her justice. Likethe Amazon, she sank into erotic formula and lost her severity and coldness.Judeo-Christianity has nothing like her except Joan of Arc. Our sense of ancientArtemis sculptures comes from the Diana of Versailles, a Roman copy. Stridingforward, bow in hand, the goddess glances over her shoulder as she draws anarrow from her quiver. She wears the huntress’ short chiton and buskins,acquired in fifth-century Greece. Artemis stalks through western space, piercingand dominating it.Postclassical art feminizes and pacifies Artemis. Kenneth Clark can lament thedecline in nobility of a god while overlooking the same thing in his twin:depictions of Apollo lost their “feeling of dread,” turning him into “thecomplacent bore of classicism.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note8a] Dread is theproper response to beings of hieratic purity. Major western painters have beeninhospitable to the Artemis idea. In Diana and Actaeon, for example, Titianmakes the goddess an awkward, rump-heavy matron. Rembrandt’s Diana is homely andmiddle-aged, breasts and belly sagging. Rembrandt’s Bellona gives the Romanwar-goddess a stunted body and porky face. French Renaissance art has manyDianas, inspired by Diane de Poitiers, mistress of Henry II. Because of theirresidual Gothicism, these works of the Fontainebleau school are persuasivelyslim, small-breasted, and emotionally cold, but they are unmistakableconflations of Diana and Venus. Goujon’s marble Diana of Anet and even Boucher’slater The Bath of Diana retain Artemis’ clarity of outline, but they are bothtoo chic for the fierce goddess of the woods.The true Artemis is remote and intimidating, offering nothing for fantasy. As anindependent female impulse, she seems to have triggered a persistent negativityamong male artists, who turn her swift and sudden action into fleshy passivity.Louis XIV ordered the muscles of the classical Venus of Arles planed down toconform to an acceptable canon of femininity. Sexual reduction is also apparentin Saint-Gaudens’ colossal gold Diana, which stood upon the turret of the oldMadison Square Garden (1891) and now commands the grand staircase of thePhiladelphia Museum of Art. The goddess has a magnificent heroic bow, but as shedraws back the string, no muscular tension ripples through her arms or emptyupper back. There is no passion for the chase or “feeling of dread” in thisnubile nymph. The true Artemis is taut in body and mind.Artemis is overshadowed by Clark’s Vegetable Aphrodite, woman as opulent organicform. Fruitfulness is the metaphor of times of famine, physical or spiritual.The first completely nude female in monumental sculpture appears at the dawn ofthe Hellenistic era, Praxiteles’ Aphrodite of Knidos (ca. 350 B.C.). Greek arthad been full of vigorous male nudes for two hundred years. The buxom KnidianAphrodite marks a shift from the homosexuality of classic Athens. It starts atradition of female posture, transmitted to Botticelli’s Venus through the RomanVenus Pudica, modestly stooping, knees pressed together. We saw this in theVenus of Willendorf, where procreative woman is bound down by her own abundance,hormonal ropes of flab. I spoke of the knock-knees of the wide-hipped woman thatinhibit running. Because of their narrow hips, men can move their legsefficiently, like pistons. The best women runners have lean male bodies.Big-breasted, wide-hipped women excel at few sports. The intimacy between fatand fertility is demonstrated by menstruation halting in woman athletes whosebody fat falls below a certain biological level. Artemis is a cancellation ofthe Vegetable Aphrodite. She rejects anatomy as destiny. Rover and ravener, sheis the woman runner who is always first. Nefertiti reverses Venus of Willendorfby displacing energy into the head. Artemis, living in and for the body,streamlines the female form by her implacable male will. She is one of theGreeks’ greatest Apollonian ideas, pitiless and frigid.Artemis exists alone. Her Amazonism is directed toward women as well as men. Aswith Apollo, her sexual duality is in her self-completion. No one before theRoman poet-pornographers attributed aberrant tastes to her. Boucher illustratesthe lesbian salaciousness in an episode from Ovid, Zeus as Artemis, wooingCallisto. But Artemis and Athena are incapable of lesbianism, since their mythicidentity is predicated on militant chasity. This chastity is a metaphor forpower, freedom, and audacity. It descends from the Great Mother’s renewablevirginity, signifying independence from males. The postclassical era haspersonified chastity in softer, more ingratiating forms—modest maidens, silentnuns, or blushing children, like Dickens’ Little Dorritt. Judeo-Christianchastity is devout self-sacrifice. But the Greeks saw chastity as an armedgoddess of brazen ego.An Orphic hymn calls Artemis arsenomorphe, “masculine in form or look.” I willuse this adjective for Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, which isstructured around a Diana myth. Hepburn is the only true Artemis in western artafter Spenser’s Belphoebe, the female warrior who swerves from all touch.Artemis is velocity and splendor. She is woman imperiously eluding the world anddefinitions of men. The sole male she honors is her brother, her double. LikeAthena, she is resolution and action. But in Athena, action takes place in andfor society: she is the helpmeet. Artemis is solitude and action joined. She isselfish, but she pushes selfhood to the limits of western possibility. Sheinhabits a purely physical realm. Spengler says, “Apollo and Athene have nosouls.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note9a] Artemis is pre-Christian purity withoutspirituality. Like Nefertiti, she is a visionary materialist. She is westernpersonality as thing, matter cleansed of the chthonian.As a woman, Artemis has a heroic glamour. She has nerve, fire, arrogance, force.She belongs to the warlike Age of Aries, preceding Christian charity. She isblood lust, bloody-mindedness. Worldwide, she is the female persona of maximumaggression, expressed in the hunt by pursuit, speed, defiance, risk. HerApollonian arrow is the western eye and the western will. Like an athlete, sheis for victory and glory. Artemis is uncomplex. She has no contradictionsbecause she has no inner life. Her Amazonism is in her polished armoured ego.She is incapable of relaxation or relenting. As a character type, she is anarrested adolescent. Her figure is boyish, her breasts undeveloped. She cannotbe psychologically, much less physically, invaded. Artemis is unfeminine becauseuninfluenced by the environment, which she surmounts. She is pristine. She neverlearns. In her blankness and coldness, she is a perfect selfhood, a sublimeenergy. Seeking parallels, one thinks of Greta Garbo, with her reclusiveness andfrosty emptiness, but not of Marlene Dietrich, who has the stunning physicalbrilliance of Artemis but also an irony gained from a worldly experience ofwhich Artemis can know nothing. Artemis the runner, connecting only through herarrows of domination, is woman darting away into western epic space. She putsinto divine perpetual motion the burden of woman’s chthonian body.In the revival of pagan culture from the Renaissance on, Apollo was hailed asthe supreme creation of classical mythology. As patron of poetry he appealed toartists, and as a beautiful young man he appealed to homosexuals. Athena hasreceived far less attention. But she dominates the Odyssey, and she was thepatron of classical Athens, which she surveyed from two colossal statues on theAcropolis. Amazon goddesses, a brilliant pagan idea, have won no popularitycontests in Christian times.Athena, I would argue, is Apollo’s equal. She has no parallels or descendants.Though she is the most cinematic of the Greek gods, film has never reproducedher. She is massive yet mobile, overwhelming by both mental and physical force.She is icon-laden, a power lifter over-determined by duty (fig. 10[ch03.html#ch03fig10]). Gilbert Murray says, “Athena is an ideal, an ideal and amystery; the ideal of wisdom, of incessant labor, of almost terrifyingpurity.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note10a] Otto says: “The modern, andparticularly the northerner, must accustom himself to the lightning clarity’ ofher form gradually. Her brightness breaks into our foggy atmosphere with almostterrifying harshness.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note11a] Athena is a beam of hardwhite light, a cold pagan sunburst. She has a dangerous luminosity. Tugged bythe hair, Homer’s Achilles recognizes her immediately, “so terrible was thebrillance of her eyes.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note12a] The Apollonian Olympiansare eye-gods, living, warning, and ruling by the aggressive western eye.Athena has a complex sexual duality, beginning with her bizarre birth. Hesiodsays Zeus, warned that his pregnant first wife Metis will bear a son strongerthan his father, swallows her whole. Athena then springs from Zeus’ brow, herexit facilitated in some accounts by the hammer blow of Hephaestus orPrometheus. Metis’ role was probably invented to explain the older legend ofAthena’s birth from the head of Zeus. Perhaps androgynous Athena is a collapsingof Metis into her male fetus. Athena is born of aggression. She must fight herway out. The hammer blow is her power too, like a fist pounding a table. Wespeak of being “struck” by a thought or, in Sixties slang, of having a “flash”of insight. Athena is Zeus ponderously thinking, treading by dread giant stepsof primitive induction. Zeus too is hermaphrodite: he has the power ofself-insemination and procreation or conception, which in English as in Latinhas a double meaning of pregnancy and comprehension. Egyptian Khepera, themasturbatory First Mover, is shown coiled in an uroboros-like circle, feettouching head, from which leaps a tiny human figure. So perhaps Zeus too is aprimal masturbator, loving himself as he would next love his sister Hera. AmazonAthena is a brazen spume of divine self-love. Gregory Zilboorg compares Athena’sbirth to the ritual couvade, where a father, after delivery of a baby, jealouslytakes to bed and is attended as if he were in labor. Citing schizophrenicfantasies of a baby issuing from head or penis, Zilboorg concludes that themyths of Athena’s and Dionysus’ birth come from “woman-envy,” male envy offemale powers, which he thinks earlier and “psychogenetically older andtherefore more fundamental” than Freud’s penis-envy.13[ch25_notes.html#ch03note13a]Image [../images/f0082-01.jpg]10. Athena Parthenos. The Varvakeion statuette. Roman marble copy, first centuryA.D., of ivory and gold colossus by Pheidias in the Parthenon, ca. 447–439 B.C.Athena’s sexual duality is also expressed in her masculine armour. The Atheniansincorrectly understood her title Pallas to mean Brandisher of Weapons (pallo, “Iwield or brandish”). In the Iliad she vanquishes the god of war by knocking himdown with a boulder. Zeus loans her his own arms, including the “huge heavyspear” and panic-spreading aegis, which she wears like a shawl. A goatskinringed with serpents, the aegis is a vestige of chthonian violence. It mayrepresent a storm cloud split by snaky thunderbolts. I see the aegis as Olympianbut not yet Apollonian. That is, it descends from earliest sky-cult, when heavenwas primitive, occult, opaque rather than rational and transparent—when it waspurple-black rather than blue-white. The sacred animal of the Acropolis, thegreat serpent of Erechtheus, legendary king of Athens, coils behind Athena’sshield. Sometimes she is shown casting a snake like a spear. The serpent may beher male alter ego, a phallic projection. It clings to her images as a remnantof her early character as a Minoan vegetation goddess.Becoming Apollonian, Artemis throws off all sign of her chthonian origins.Athena, on the other hand, bristles with barbaric badges, notably the Gorgon’shead on breast and shield. Freud says this “symbol of horror” makes her “a womanwho is unapproachable and repels all sexual desires—since she displays theterrifying genitals of the Mother.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note14a] Serenevirginity symbolized by chthonian ugliness: Milton resolves this incongruity indefining Minerva’s “snaky-headed Gorgon shield” as the goddess’ “rigid looks ofChaste austerity” (Comus 447–50). A rigid look is phallic ocular aggression.In Athena’s elaborate iconography, so unlike the emblematic simplicity of theother Olympians, resides her uncanniness, her sex-surpassing power. Scholarshiphas shown relatively little interest in her transvestite armour. There isuniversal acceptance of Martin Nilsson’s theory that Athena was a pre-Hellenicdeity who became palace goddess of the Mycenaean warlords. Hence she donned herarmour as defender of the citadel. But etiology does not explain persistence.The armed Athena lingered on more than five hundred years after the end ofMycenaean culture. As Thucydides notes, the Athenians were the first people togo about without weapons. C. J. Herington describes two different versions ofAthena worshipped on the Acropolis: the goddess of the Erechtheum was a peacefulfertility goddess, shown seated and unarmed; Athena Parthenos, the virgingoddess of the Parthenon (“Virgin Temple”), was a standing or striding warriorin battle armour. These presumably correspond to her incarnations as AthenaErgane, patron of handicrafts and weaving, and Athena Promachos, champion of thefighting line. She appeared as the latter in Pheidias’ two colossi, the ivoryand gold statue inside the Parthenon and its outdoor companion, whose glintinghelmet could be seen by ships at sea as far as Cape Sunium.Thus, far from the Mycenaeans permanently fixing Athena in their own martialimage, her Mino an prototype remained available for metaphorical developmentuntil the high classic period. We must explain why the armed Athena prevailed inAthens, for whom she meant far more than military might. As Herington remarks,“When we reach the age of Pericles and Pheidias it will be she who is chosen toexpress the highest beliefs of that age.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note15a]Athens’ mirror image was a solar androgyne, perfect in body, mind, and eye.Athena’s sexual hybridism is already evident in Homer, who makes her descents asexual masquerade. In the Iliad, Athena appears on earth four times as a male,once as a vulture, and six times in her own form. In the Odyssey, she appearseight times as a male, twice as a human girl, six times as herself. She issometimes aged Mentor or Phoenix, sometimes a beautiful shepherd or “sturdyspearman” in arms. One of Homer’s most magical motifs is this busy flying aboutof Athena-energy. Only once does another deity take cross-sexual form, when Irisappears to Priam as his son Polites. Hera never appears as a man, since shelacks the masculine component that would enable her to do so. Vergil adopts thetranssexual motif somewhat mechanically: Juturna, Turnus’ sister, appears onceas a warrior and twice as a charioteer. But this is because the Aeneid hasabsorbed and lavishly reimagined Homer’s Amazon theme in the glamourous andwillful tragic heroines, Dido and Camilla.What does Athena’s androgyny mean? Jane Harrison says patriarchy turned “thelocal Kore of Athens” into “a sexless thing, neither man nor woman”: “To the endshe remains manufactured, unreal, and never convinces us…. We cannot love agoddess who on principle forgets the Earth from which she sprang.”16[ch25_notes.html#ch03note16a] Harrison acknowledges Athena’s androgyny but findsit distasteful. The indignation in her long indictment comes from her mistakenbelief in a Mediterranean matriarchy, overthrown by men. Athena is therefore acollaborator with the oppressor. She is sexually inauthentic because of herabandonment of the chthonian, the analysis of which is the permanent distinctionof Harrison’s wonderful body of work. Harrison has influenced me heavily, but mytheory of the chthonian is darker and less trusting. I see too much Wordsworthin her nineteenth-century view of nature. I follow Sade and Coleridge.My refutation of Harrison’s view begins with her assertion, “The strangedenaturalized birth of Athene from the brain of Zeus is a dark, desperate effortto make thought the basis of being and reality.”17 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note17a]But Athena never did represent pure thought. Metis, the name of her supposedmother, means “counsel, wisdom, skill, cunning, craft.” Even sophia is first“cleverness, skill, cunning, shrewdness” and only secondly “scientificknowledge, wisdom, philosophy.” Athena is techne (“art, skill”) rather than nous(“mind”). Thus her patronage of the crafts. Her special favorites are men ofaction, especially Odysseus, Homer’s “man of many wiles.” The virtues she givesare listed by a suitor praising Penelope—“the matchless gifts that she owes toAthene, her skill in fine handicraft, her excellent brain, and that genius shehas for getting her way.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note18a] Both Odysseus andPenelope are tricksters and master strategists. Life for him is a performanceart. He brings down Troy by a ruse, where brute force has failed. He can make aboat from scratch or carve a bed from a living tree. He escapes Cyclops’ cave byimprovising a cruel log tool and mimicking the Trojan horse by riding out undera ram. Homeric mind is ingenuity, practical intelligence. There is no Rodinlikedeep thinking, no mathematical or philosophical speculation. That comes muchlater in history. Odysseus thinks with his hands. He is athlete, gambler,engineer. Athena rules technological man, the Greek heir to Egyptianconstructionism.Here, I propose, is the answer to Athena’s androgyny. She appears in moredisguises and crosses sexual borderlines more often than any other Greek godbecause she symbolizes the resourceful, adaptive mind, the ability to invent,plan, conspire, cope, and survive. The mind as techne, pragmatic design, washermaphroditic for the ancients, much as the psyche is hermaphroditic for Jungin an era when selfhood expands to include the unconscious. Athena personifiesonly the waking ego, daylight energies. Premodern psychology externalizeddaemonic powers that we locate in the soul. Thus the Gorgon is on Athena’sbreast but not in her heart. Athena as the transsexual contriving mind exploitssituation and opportunity, subduing circumstance to will and desire. Here forthe first time we see the androgyne as a cultural symbol of mind. TheRenaissance recasts the androgyne in alchemical terms to represent intuition andthe spiritualization of matter. Romanticism uses the androgyne to symbolizeimagination, the creative process, and poetry itself.All-male Ares is the battle frenzy, a rabid half-animal state. But androgynousAthena mentalizes war. Among her inventions are the war harness, the trumpet,and the Pyrrhic dance in armour. She is goddess of battle music and the battleshout. In a Futurist Manifesto, Marinetti speaks of “an aesthetics of war.”Athena turns war into an art form: calculated resolute action is the historicalcrisscrossing of western space. Harrison’s association of Athena with purethought belongs to the Hellenistic era, when the goddess increasinglypersonified sober, solitary wisdom.As presiding deity of the Odyssey, Athena is a projected displacement of themercurial consciousness of cagey Odysseus, the dexterous escape artist. Theconnection between Athena’s adventurous transsexualism and the machinations ofthe subtle mind is demonstrated in a scene where she changes sex before oureyes. Waking on the foggy shore of Ithaca, the goal toward which he hasstruggled for ten years, Odysseus sees a young shepherd with a javelin, Athenain disguise. Odysseus spins a long spurious saga of woe.The bright-eyed goddess smiled at Odysseus’ tale and caressed him with her hand.Her appearance altered, and now she looked like a woman, tall, beautiful, andaccomplished….“And so my stubborn friend, Odysseus the arch-deceiver, with his craving forintrigue, does not propose even in his own country to drop his sharp practiceand the lying tales that he loves from the bottom of his heart. But no more ofthis: we are both adepts in chicane. For in the world of men you have no rivalas a statesman and orator, while I am preeminent among the gods for inventionand resource.”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note19a]Thus Homer’s first scene after the hero achieves his nostos or homecoming takesritualistic form: one of Odysseus’ shrewd stratagems is enclosed within, like aset of heraldic parentheses, Athena male and Athena female. The dreamlikesex-transformation is a masquelike reenactment of the central false speech.Smiling with pleasure, Athena says in effect, “What a marvelous liar you are!”Lies are legal Bronze Age piracy. Here as at the Phaeacian banquet, Odysseus thestoryteller stands proxy for Homer the bard. Homeric cinema: the sex-changeepisode theatrically synchronizes word and image. The link between Athena’stechnical skills and Odysseus’ lies is perfectly conveyed in our word“fabrication.” Sexually mobile Athena literally is the shifting, shifty powersof human intelligence. Sexual personae are the jumpy primal nerve-chemistry ofimpulse and choice.To Harrison’s complaint, then, that Athena has forgotten “the earth from whichshe sprang,” I reply that Athena is divorced from earth because she representsthe man-made. As patron of the crafts and cultivated olive, she gives mancontrol over capricious nature. For Harrison, Athena’s virginity is sterilebecause unfertile in the chthonian sense. But virginity is perfect autonomy.Jackson Knight says, “The maidenhood of city goddesses seems to have been insome magical sympathy with the unbroken defence of a city.”20[ch25_notes.html#ch03note20a] Athena as patron of Athens is the wall that shutsthe enemy out, the enemy nature as well as the enemy man. Her virginity is herstable Apollonian self, the intractable will behind her hermaphrodite changes.She is fortitude and pressing forward, a job to do. She is the fanaticalpurposiveness of the west, limited but all-achieving.Aphrodite and Hermes illustrate the gradual purgation of chthonian elements fromthe Olympians. Neither became completely Apollonian, as I define it. But theyprovide models for two of my sexual personae.Aphrodite, a Near Eastern fertility goddess, was one of the last additions tothe Olympian pantheon. She began as potent All-Mother and ended up in lateantiquity as a sentimental literary convention, patron of love and beauty. Insome places, her cult retained traces of her original bisexual character. Hesiodis the source of the story of her birth from sea foam splashed up by the fall ofUranus’ mutilated genitals. Though this savage tale may be another fancifuletymology (aphros, “foam, froth”), it suggests something sexually problematic inthe goddess, for newborn Aphrodite is a transubstantiation of Uranus’ virility.Athena bursts from a divine brain, Aphrodite from divine balls. The goddesses ofmutant birth are to be victors over males in separate realms.On her native Cyprus, Aphrodite was worshipped as the Venus Barbata, the BeardedVenus. Her image wore female clothing but had a beard and male genitals. Ritualsacrifices were conducted by men and women in transvestite dress. Elsewhere, asthe Venus Calva or Bald Venus, Aphrodite was shown with a man’s bald head, likepriests of Isis. Aristophanes calls her Aphroditos, a Cypriot male name.Aphrodite appeared in battle armour in Sparta, which may have borrowed thecustom from Cythera. The Venus Armata or Armed Venus became a Renaissanceconvention, partly because of the appearance of Vergil’s Venus as Diana. I adoptthe names Venus Barbata and Venus Calva, the Bearded and Bald Venus, for certainhighly aggressive, corrosively verbal movie stars like Bette Davis and ElizabethTaylor.Early Hermes was indistinguishable from the piles of stones and phallicmonuments called “herms” that marked Greek boundary lines. When he attains humanshape, it is as a mature bearded man, Psychopompos, escorter of souls to theunderworld. The two centuries from Archaic to Hellenistic art change him into abeautiful beardless youth, like Apollo. Masculine agrarian vigor becomesandrogynous urbanity. Late Hermes influences Roman Mercury, to whom Vergil gives“blonde hair and graceful young limbs” (Aen. IV.559). The development fromHermes to Mercury is from crude earth-centered monolith to earth-defyingair-swimmer—from the chthonian to the Apollonian. Late Hermes appears inGiambologna’s sleek bronze of Mercury in flight, a logo of American florists.Our idea of the mercurial comes from the swiftness of wing-footed Mercury.Hermes is patron of magic and theft. His epithets are “crafty,” “deceiving,”“ingenious.” Otto speaks of his “nimbleness and subtle cunning,” his “wonderfuldeftness” and “mischievousness.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note21a] In real life, Iobserve, a volatile mingling of masculine and feminine accompanies thisconstellation of irrepressible, unscrupulous traits. Free movement among moodstates automatically opens one to multiple sexual personae. Though he hasHermes’ cunning, Odysseus’ persona is ruggedly masculine, like early Hermes. Thesexual duality latent in Odysseus’ strategic personae resides in his androgynouspatron, Athena. Mercurius, Latin for the god, planet, and quicksilver, is theallegorical hermaphrodite of medieval alchemy. I adopt the name Mercurius for acrazed, witty, restless, elusive, sexually ambiguous creature. Examples areShakespeare’s Rosalind and Ariel, Goethe’s Mignon, Tolstoy’s Natasha, andPatrick Dennis’ Auntie Mame.Hermes carries either a magic herald’s staff or the caduceus, a winged rodwrapped by two serpents, a symbol of healing. The caduceus may have a bisexualmeaning, like the Egyptian uraeus, Cretan labrys or double ax, and ourThanksgiving cornucopia, which is both a phallic bull’s horn and an overflowing,abundant womb. The circular uroboros is similarly bisexual. Neumann calls it“the serpent which at once bears, begets, and devours.” An alchemic text, citedby Jung, says, “The dragon slays itself, weds itself, impregnates itself.”22[ch25_notes.html#ch03note22a] Bisexuality, in symbol or persona, recreates theplenum of primitive cosmogony.Dionysus, Apollo’s antagonist and rival, is not among Homer’s Olympians, thoughhe is the son of Zeus. The Apollonian Olympians, I said, are eye-gods. Dionysusrepresents obliteration of the western eye. Heir to the Great Mother ofchthonian nature, he is, with Osiris, the greatest of the dying gods of mysteryreligion. Out of his worship came two rituals of enormous impact on westernculture, tragic drama and Christian liturgy.Dionysus’ androgyny, like Athena’s, begins in a sexually irregular birth. Whenhis pregnant mother, Semele, demands her lover prove he is Zeus, she is burnt toa crisp. Zeus plucks his son from her womb, makes a slit in his own thigh, andsews up the fetus till it comes to term. In the Bacchae, Euripides imagines Zeussummoning Dionysus to “enter this my male womb” (526–27). Zeus’s artificial wombresembles Adonis’ tusk-torn thigh, a symbol for the castration of themother-cults. Zeus’s Dionysian pregnancy makes the symbolic equation of childwith penis that Freud finds in the maternal psyche. The analogy is supported bya Greek pun on the words for grapevine and scrotum (Image[../images/w-01.gif]σχη and Image [../images/o-01.gif]σχη), honored at theAthenian Oschophoria, harvest festival of Dionysus the wine god.The Greeks inaccurately read Dionysus’ double birth in his epithet Dithyrambos,the name also of his ritual song: di + thura = “double door.” The god is bornthrough two doors, one female, one male. Jane Harrison says of puberty rites ofpassage, “With the savage, to be twice born is the rule, not the exception.” Andelsewhere: “The birth from the male womb is to rid the child from the infectionof its mother—to turn him from a woman-thing into a man-thing.”23[ch25_notes.html#ch03note23a] At the opening of the Odyssey, Telemachus,inspired by male-born Athena, searches for his father by turning against hismother. Jesus too publicly spurns his mother to be about his father’s business.Male adulthood begins with the breaking of female chains. But Dionysus reversesloyalties. He remains the son of his mother, wearing her clothes and loiteringwith bands of women (fig. 11 [ch03.html#ch03fig11]).Dionysus’ transvestism is more complete than Athena’s. She adds male armour to afemale tunic, but he retains nothing male except a beard. Archaic vases show himin a woman’s tunic, saffron veil, and hairnet. His name Bassareus comes from theThracian bassara, a woman’s fox-skin mantle. He is called Pseudanor, the FakeMan. Ritual transvestism was fairly common in Greek cult. The procession of theOschophoria was led by two boys dressed as girls. Performers of Dionysus’ ritualdance, the Ithyphallos, appeared in the costume of the opposite sex. In theHybristika and Hysteria, Aphrodite’s festival at Argos, men wore women’s veilsand women wore male dress. In the festival of Hera on Samos, men wore women’srobes and adorned themselves with bracelets, necklaces, and golden hairnets. Onwedding nights at Cos, the bridegroom wore women’s robes. At Sparta, the bride,head shaved, wore men’s garments and boots. At Argos, the bride donned a falsebeard.Image [../images/f0090-01.jpg]11. Dionysus and Maenads. Attic red-figured amphora by the Kleophrades Painter,ca. 500 B.C.Several Greek hero sagas have transvestite interludes. Supermasculine Herculesis enslaved by the Amazon Omphale, who makes him wear women’s clothing and spinwool. The tale was reenacted in the Hercules cult at Cos, where his priest worefemale dress. Arriving in Athens, young Theseus was mistaken for a girl andmocked by a crowd of laborers. Nothing changes in the construction trade! Thehero responded by hurling a chariot over a rooftop. Achilles, the supreme Greekwarrior, began his career in drag. The story of his exposure by Odysseus, whofound him among the women on Scyros, may recall tribal initiations where a bandof men invades the women’s quarters to kidnap a boy into adult life. Polygnotuspainted the transvestite Achilles in the Propylaea of the Acropolis, andEuripides devoted a lost play to the subject, The Scyrians.Ritual transvestism, then and now, is a drama of female dominance. There arereligious meanings to all female impersonation, in nightclub or bedroom. A womanputting on men’s clothes merely steals social power. But a man putting onwomen’s clothes is searching for God. He memorializes his mother, whom hewatched at the boudoir ritual of her mirror. Mothers and fathers are not in thesame cosmic league. Fatherhood is short, motherhood long, for earth is a motherof ever-changing costume, green to brown and back. The Bible condemnstranvestism as bag and baggage of the Asiatic mother-cults. Yet the pagantradition survives in Rio de Janeiro at Carnival, in New Orleans at Mardi Gras,in Philadelphia on New Year’s Day, and everywhere on Halloween. Halloweenmasquerade is apotropaic, mimicking the dead on their night of nights in orderto drive off their ghosts. Ancient transvestism could be similarly propitiatory.What is sexually grotesque or criminal in our culture may have symbolicsignificance elsewhere. Frazer says of a tribal custom in north New Guinea,where the genitals of a murdered man were eaten by an old woman and the genitalsof a murdered woman eaten by an old man, “Perhaps the intention is to unsex anddisarm the dangerous ghost.”24 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note24a] In primitive life,sex is religion and vice versa. Christianity has never shut down the ritualtheater of sex.Dionysus’ transvestism, then, symbolizes his radical identification withmothers. I connect this to his association with water, milk, blood, sap, honey,and wine. The Roman and Renaissance Bacchus is no more than a wine god. ButGreek Dionysus rules what Plutarch calls the hygra physis, wet or liquid nature.Dionysus is, as Farnell puts it, “the liquid principle in things.”25[ch25_notes.html#ch03note25a] Dionysian liquidity is the invisible sea oforganic life, flooding our cells and uniting us to plants and animals. Ourbodies are Ferenczi’s primeval ocean, surging and rippling. I interpretPlutarch’s hygra physis as not free-flowing but contained water, fluids whichooze, drip, or hang in tissues or fleshy sacs. The hygra physis is the maturefemale body, which I declare a prison of gender. Female experience is submergedin the world of fluids, dramatically demonstrated in menstruation, childbirth,and lactation. Edema, water-retention, that female curse, is Dionysus’ leadenembrace. Male tumescence is an assertion of the separateness of objects. Anerection is architectural, sky-pointing. Female tumescence, through blood orwater, is slow, gravitational, amorphous. In the war for human identity, maletumescence is an instrument, female tumescence an obstruction. The fatty femalebody is a sponge. At peak menstrual and natal moments, it is locked passively inplace, suffering wave after wave of Dionysian power.There are male initiates into female experience. The white circus clown, forexample, is an androgyne of female fatness. In silhouette, he is pregnant.Stumbling, tumbling, buffeted, he is a tumescence which cannot act but is onlyacted upon. The morbidly obese man, my next example, loses virility because heis paralyzed by passive engorgement. The fat man as hollow female vessel appearsin Prince Hal’s satire of Falstaff as “that trunk of humors, … that swoll’nparcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloakbag of guts” (IHen IV II.iv.454–57). In Emblems (1635), Francis Quarles expands these images tonature, rebuking the fat man, “Thy skin’s a bladder blown with watry tumours; /Thy flesh a trembling bog, a quagmire full of humours” (I.xii.4). Bog andquagmire are my chthonian swamp, that dank primal brew of earth and water that Iidentify with the female body. Fatness is fluidity, the Dionysian masterprinciple. Karl Stern diagnoses as “a caricature of femininity” theself-thwarting of neurotic men “whose attitude toward life was one of hoardingand retentiveness, with a tendency to unproductive accumulation, a kind ofunending pregnancy of material inflation which never came to creativeness or‘birth’.” He calls this syndrome “accumulation without issue.”26[ch25_notes.html#ch03note26a] It is a diseased male pregnancy, a stagnantfatness of mind rather than body. It may be an occupational hazard of academe,typified by the disappointed mythographer Casaubon of George Eliot’sMiddlemarch.Dionysus’ female chthonian swamp is inhabited by silent, swarming invertebrates.I proposed that the taboo attached to women is justified and that the infamous“uncleanness” of menstruation is due not to blood but to uterine jellies in thatblood. The primal swamp is choked with menstrual albumen, the lukewarm matrix ofnature, teeming with algae and bacteria. We have a food that symbolizes thisswamp: raw clams on the half-shell. Twenty years ago, I noticed the strongemotions roused by this delicacy, to which few are indifferent. Common reactionsrange from ecstasy to revulsion. Why? The clam is a microcosm of the femalehygra physis. It is as aesthetically and psychologically disturbing as menstrualalbumen. The primitive shapelessness of raw clams offers sensuous access to somearchaic swamp-experience.Botticelli’s Venus coasts to shore on the half-shell. Sexual love is a deep-seadiving into the timeless and elemental. G. Wilson Knight says, “Life rose fromthe sea. Our bodies are three parts water and our minds compacted of saltylusts.”27 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note27a] Woman’s body reeks of the sea. Ferenczisays, “The genital secretion of the female among the higher mammals and in man …possesses a distinctly fishy odor (odor of herring brine), according to thedescription of all physiologists; this odor of the vagina comes from the samesubstance (trimethylamine) as the decomposition of fish gives rise to.”28[ch25_notes.html#ch03note28a] Raw clams, I am convinced, have a latentlycunnilingual character that many find repugnant. Eating a clam, fresh-killed,barely dead, is a barbarous, amorous plunging into mother nature’s cold saltsea.Scatology and graffiti, in their perennial folk wisdom, rudely acknowledgewoman’s marine character. Slang calls female genitals “the bearded clam.” Bawdyt-shirts and bumper stickers link fish-consumption with virility. Ivy Leaguestudents recently traded the following ripostes, scratched in different hands onthe wall of a library study stall: “Women smell like fish! Men smell like shit!Do women like to smell fish? Do fish smell like women? Do fish like to smellwomen?”Dionysus, god of fluids, rules a murky no man’s land of matter half-turned toliquid. Neumann notes the linguistic connection in German between Mutter,mother; Moder, bog; Moor, fen; Marsch, marsh; and Meer, ocean.29[ch25_notes.html#ch03note29a] A chthonian miasma hangs over woman, like thepolluted cloud raining pestilence on Oedipus’ Thebes. The miasma is woman’sprocreative fate, linking her to the primeval. Artemis is woman on the run,breaking out of her cloud into Apollonian sunlight. Artemis’ radiance is amilitant self-hardening, a refusal of menarche. Dionysus, endorsing woman, alsokeeps her in the chthonian swamp. Sartre speaks of the mucoid or slimy, levisqueux, “a substance in between two states,” “a moist and feminine sucking,”“a liquid seen in a nightmare,”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note30a] Sartre’s slimeis Dionysus’ swamp, the fleshy muck of the generative matrix. There is no visionbecause there are no eyes. Apollo’s solar torch is put out; the heart ofcreation is blind. In nature’s female womb-world, there are no objects and noart.Dionysus is the all-embracing totality of mother-cult. Nothing disgusts him,since he contains everything that is. Disgust is an Apollonian response, anaesthetic judgment. Disgust always indicates some misalignment toward orswerving away from the maternal. Huysmans speaks of “the humid horror” ofwoman’s unclean body.31 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note31a] I will argue thatnineteenth-century aestheticism, a vision of a glittering crystalline world, isa flight from the chthonian swamp into which nature-loving Wordsworthinadvertently led Romanticism. Aestheticism insists on the Apollonian line,separating objects from each other and from nature. Disgust is Apollonian fearat a melting borderline. Ernest Jones says Hamlet’s denunciation of his mothershows “that almost physical disgust which is so characteristic a manifestationof intensely ‘repressed’ sexual feeling.”32 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note32a] Yes,Hamlet struggles against the lure of Oedipal incest. But we all commit incestwith the nature mother. Hamlet rails against the “reechy kisses” of “the bloatKing” (III.iv.183–85). A bloated male is my pregnant paralyzed clown. Or it is aripe corpse in a garden, the thrifty baked meat of the royal wedding table.Hamlet, as all sons of all mothers, is bloated with “this too too solid flesh.”His first soliloquy is a strange chain of associations with a hidden chthonianlogic: it moves from suicidal self-disgust to thoughts of the world as “anunweeded garden,” overgrown by “things rank and gross in nature,” and ends inlurid visualization of his mother’s sex life amid rumpled “incestuous sheets,”sweaty soiled rags, both swaddlings and shroud, mother nature’s bindings ofbirth and death (I.ii.129–59). The play is filled with bad smells. The stench isfrom an unavenged corpse but also from the female prima materia, the humid baseof organic life, which Hamlet resists in decadent revulsion.Another female closet, another swamp of sex and filth: Jonathan Swift’s oddpoem, The Lady’s Dressing Room. Another male as lover, hater, voyeur, forcinghis way into the squalid womb-world from which we came. It is slippery withrefuse, poison, and magic ointments. Swift rejects his protagonist’s disgust:“Should I the Queen of Love refuse, / Because she rose from stinking Ooze?”Venus skims into town on a sewer. Swift confirms my identification of shellfishand swamp. The hearty poet will eat the clam, while his protagonist gags withSartre’s nausea. Swift’s boudoir mire may come from Milton’s Comus, where avirgin is stuck to her enchanted chair, “smear’d with gums of glutinous heat.”These are piney Dionysian resins, fishy female jellies, the dead weight ofMedusan paralysis. Sex locks us in place. The virgin is released from the mucoidswamp by a water-nymph from under “the glassy cool, translucent wave,” anApollonian realm of purity, clarity, and vision. Milton’s chastity is “clad incomplete steel,” “a quiver’d Nymph with Arrows keen,” like Spenser’s Amazons.33[ch25_notes.html#ch03note33a] Chastity is always a triumph of Apollo overDionysus. It is the sanctity of the object reclaimed from the dank, clingyliquidity of chthonian nature. Scylla or Charybdis: woman’s lubriciouslubrications are the easy road to Lear’s hell, where both sexes are lost.The Dionysian was trivialized by Sixties polemicists, who turned it into playand protest. Pot on the picketline. Sex in the romper room. Benign regression.But the great god Dionysus is the barbarism and brutality of mother nature.Comparing the Orphic to Olympian strains in Greek religion, Gilbert Murray says,“These things are Gods or forms of God: not fabulous immortal men, but ‘Thingswhich Are’, things utterly non-human and non-moral, which bring man bliss ortear his life to shreds without a break in their own serenity.”34[ch25_notes.html#ch03note34a] Dionysus liberates by destroying. He is notpleasure but pleasure-pain, the tormenting bondage of our life in the body. Foreach gift he exacts a price. Dionysian orgy ended in mutilation anddismemberment. The Maenads’ frenzy was bathed in blood. True Dionysian dance isa rupturing extremity of torsion. The harsh percussive accents of Stravinsky,Martha Graham, and rock music are cosmic concussions upon the human, volleys ofpure force. Dionysian nature is cataclysmic. Our bodies are pagan temples,heathen holdouts against Judeo-Christian soul or mind. A modern overimbiber,kneeling, moaning, and compulsively vomiting, is said to be “worshipping at theporcelain god.” When the body’s chthonian spasms take over, we are invaded byDionysus. The uterine contractions of menstruation and childbirth are Dionysus’fist clenching in our bowels. Birth is expulsion, a rocky cascade of spasmskicking us out in a river of blood. We are skin drums which nature beats.Invitation to Dionysian dance is a binding contract of enslavement to nature.The violent principle of Dionysian cult is sparagmos, which in Greek means “arending, tearing, mangling” and secondly “a convulsion, spasm.” The body of thegod, or a human or animal substitute, is torn to pieces, which are eaten orscattered like seed. Omophagy, ritual eating of raw flesh, is the assimilationand internalization of godhead. Ancient mystery religion was posited on theworshipper’s imitation of the god. Cannibalism was impersonation, a primitivetheater. You are what you eat. The body parts of dismembered Osiris, scatteredacross the earth, were collected by Isis, who founded a shrine at each site.Before his arrest, Jesus tears the Passover bread for his disciples: “Take, eat;this is my body” (Mt. 26:26). At every Christian service, wafers and wine arechanged into Christ’s body and blood, consumed by the worshipper. InCatholicism, this is not symbolic but literal. Transubstantiation iscannibalism. Dionysian sparagmos was an ecstasy of sexual excitation andsuperhuman strength. Try disjointing a grocery chicken with your barehands!—much less a living goat or heifer. The scattering of sparagmosinseminated the earth. Hence swallowing the god’s parts was an act of physicallove. There may be an element of omophagy in all oral sex, a mystic ritual,reverent and sadistic. Nature lives by sparagmos, no literary abstraction. Sheis forever tearing apart in order to remake: a witness of a recent air crash,where 131 died when a wind shear slapped the plane to the ground, toldreporters, “It was like arms and legs separated and burning.” Accidents anddisasters are a religious spectacle. The sensationalizing media give us thegrotesque truth about reality.Meditating on Apollo and Dionysus, Plutarch says dismemberment is a metaphor forDionysus’ metamorphoses “into winds and water, earth and stars, and into thegenerations of plants and animals.”35 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note35a] Dionysus,like Proteus, shifts through all forms of being, high to low. Human, animal,plant, mineral: none has special status. All are equalized and sacralized in thecontinuum of natural energy. Dionysus, leveling the great chain of being,respects no hierarchy. Plutarch says “riddles and fabulous tales” about Dionysus“construct destructions and disappearances, followed by returns to life andregenerations.” Mystery religions offered initiates eternal life. Promise ofresurrection was and is a major reason for Christianity’s spread. Olympian culthad no such lure: the visible separatism of the sharp-edged Apollonian godsapplied also to their relations with worshippers. Jane Harrison says of thebirth of tragedy in Dionysian ritual, “Athene and Zeus and Poseidon have nodrama because no one, in his wildest moments, believed he could become and beAthene or Zeus or Poseidon.”36 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note36a] Mystery religion’simpersonation and theatricality linger in Christian liturgy, where celebrant andlaity replay the Last Supper and blood-sacrifice of the Crucifixion. TheImitation of Christ suffuses prayer and ritual, as in the fourteen Stations ofthe Cross or the stigmata, Christ’s bleeding wounds miraculously appearing onhands and feet of the devout. Our word enthusiasm comes from Dionysianenthousiasmos, a wild state of holy inspiration. The devotee was entheos, “fullof the god.” Man and god were fused: Frazer says, “Every dead Egyptian wasidentified with Osiris and bore his name.”37 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note37a]Mystery religion is a communion, a union of human and divine, surging throughthe world with all-conquering force. Mystery religion is a vibration, a tremoror temblor reducing the visible to the tangible, a brute laying on of hands.The Apollonian and Dionysian, two great western principles, govern sexualpersonae in life and art. My theory is this: Dionysus is identification, Apolloobjectification. Dionysus is the empathic, the sympathetic emotion transportingus into other people, other places, other times. Apollo is the hard, coldseparatism of western personality and categorical thought. Dionysus is energy,ecstasy, hysteria, promiscuity, emotionalism—heedless indiscriminateness of ideaor practice. Apollo is obsessiveness, voyeurism, idolatry, fascism—frigidity andaggression of the eye, petrifaction of objects. Human imagination rolls throughthe world seeking cathexis. Here, there, everywhere, it invests itself inperishable things of flesh, silk, marble, and metal, materializations of desire.Words themselves the west makes into objects. Complete harmony is impossible.Our brains are split, and brain is split from body. The quarrel between Apolloand Dionysus is the quarrel between the higher cortex and the older limbic andreptilian brains. Art reflects on and resolves the eternal human dilemma oforder versus energy. In the west, Apollo and Dionysus strive for victory. Apollomakes the boundary lines that are civilization but that lead to convention,constraint, oppression. Dionysus is energy unbound, mad, callous, destructive,wasteful. Apollo is law, history, tradition, the dignity and safety of customand form. Dionysus is the new, exhilarating but rude, sweeping all away to beginagain. Apollo is a tyrant, Dionysus a vandal. Every excess breeds itscounterreaction. So western culture swings from point to point on its complexcycle, pouring forth its lavish tributes of art, word, and deed. We havelittered the world with grandiose achievements. Our story is vast, lurid, andunending.Now to translate these principles into psychology and politics. Plutarch callsApollo the One, “denying the Many and abjuring multiplicity.”38[ch25_notes.html#ch03note38a] The Apollonian is aristocratic, monarchist, andreactionary. Volatile, mobile Dionysus is hoi polloi, the Many. He is rabble andrubble, both democratic mob-rule and the slurry of uncountable objects rumblingthrough nature. Harrison says, “Apollo is the principle of simplicity, unity andpurity, Dionysos of manifold change and metamorphosis.”39[ch25_notes.html#ch03note39a] Greek artists, says Plutarch, attribute to Apollo“uniformity, orderliness, and unadulterated seriousness” but to Dionysus“variability,” “playfulness, wantonness, and frenzy.” Dionysus is a masquer andimproviser; he is daemonic energy and plural identity. Dodds states: “He isLusios, ‘the Liberator’—the god who by very simple means, or by other means notso simple, enables you for a short time to stop being yourself, and thereby setyou free…. The aim of his cult was ecstasis—which could mean anything from‘taking you out of yourself to a profound alteration of personality.”40[ch25_notes.html#ch03note40a] Ecstasis (“standing outside of”) is trancelikeself-removal, schizoid or shamanistic. Dionysus’ amorality cuts both ways. He isgod of theater, masked balls, and free love—but also of anarchy, gang rape, andmass murder. Playfulness and criminality are first cousins, flouting the norm.Frosty Apollo has a sculptural coherence and clarity. The Apollonian “One,”strict, rigid, and contained, is western personality as work of art, haughty andelegant.Dionysian sparagmos and Dionysian liquidity are analogous. Sparagmos denies theidentity of objects. It is nature grinding down and dissolving matter to energy.Ernst Cassirer speaks of the “instability” and “law of metamorphosis” of themythical world, which is “at a much more fluid and fluctuating stage than ourtheoretical world of things and properties.”41 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note41a]Dionysian fluidity is the plenum of the dank female swamp. Dionysianmetamorphoses are the scintillations of nature’s high-energy perpetual-motionmachine. Sparagmos and metamorphosis, sex and violence flood our dream life,where objects and persons flicker and merge. Dreams are Dionysian magic in thesensory inflammation of sleep. Sleep is a cavern to which we nightly descend,our bed a musty burrow of primeval hibernation. There we go into trance,drooling and twitching. Dionysus is our body’s automatic reflexes andinvoluntary functions, the serpentine peristalsis of the archaic. Apollofreezes, Dionysus dissolves. Apollo says, “Stop!” Dionysus says, “Move!” Apollobinds together and battens down against the storm of nature.G. Wilson Knight remarks, “The Apollonian is the created ideal, forms ofvisionary beauty that can be seen, sight rather than sound, intellectually clearto us.”42 [ch25_notes.html#ch03note42a] We contemplate the Apollonian from anaesthetic distance. In Dionysian identification, space is collapsed. The eyecannot maintain point of view. Dionysus can’t see the forest for the trees. Thewet dream of Dionysian liquidity takes the hard edges off things. Objects andideas are fuzzy, misty—that mistiness Johnny Mathis sings of in love. Dionysianempathy is Dionysian dissolution. Sparagmos is sharing, breaking bread or bodytogether. Dionysian identification is fellow feeling, extended or enlargedidentity. It passed into Christianity, which tried to separate Dionysian lovefrom Dionysian nature. But as I said, there is no agape or caritas without eros.The continuum of empathy and emotion leads to sex. Failure to realize that wasthe Christian error. The continuum of sex leads to sadomasochism. Failure torealize that was the error of the Dionysian Sixties. Dionysus expands identitybut crushes individuals. There is no liberal dignity of the person in theDionysian. The god gives latitude but no civil rights. In nature we areconvicted without appeal."},{"pageContent":"4PAGAN BEAUTYThe competing Apollonian and Dionysian elements in Greek culture remainedunresolved. Egypt alone was able to synthesize sunlit clarity of form withdaemonic earth-cult: it honored both the eye and the labyrinth of biology.Egyptian state religion, with its mystic obscurantism yet soaring cleargeometries, unified the classes in one system of belief. In Greece there mayhave been a split, with aristocrats following Olympian sky-cult, while farmers,nominally Olympian, cautiously continued to honor primeval spirits of the soil.Fifth-century Athenian culture was supremely Apollonian. Indeed, classic styleis always a defeat of Dionysus by Apollo. It is form rescued from mother earth’soceanic dissolutions.High classic moments, as at the Renaissance, are short. The artist speaks forhis nation and is buoyed by a rush of collective confidence. This was theShakespeare of the Elizabethan 1590s or the Michelangelo of the David andCreation of Man. But politics spiral out of control. David turns into Goliath.The idealist on the throne is followed by the cynic. Out of the morass ofByzantine court politics came the Jacobean Shakespeare of Hamlet and the problemplays and the Mannerist Michelangelo of the stormy Last Judgment and MediciChapel nudes. High classic art is simple, serene, balanced. Late-phase art isaccomplished but anxious. Composition is crowded or overwrought; color is lurid.The Hellenistic Laocoön shows the theatrical perversity of late style: heroicmale athleticism strained and bursting, strangled by serpents. Beautiful andgrotesque conjoin. Late-phase art defiles high classic form with mother nature’ssex and violence. Dionysus, bound down by Apollo, always escapes and returnswith a vengeance.The movement from Dionysus to Apollo and back is illustrated in two landmarks ofGreek drama, Aeschylus’ Oresteia (458 B.C.) and Euripides’ Bacchae (407 B.C.),which stand at either end of classical Athens. From Aeschylus’ generation,exhilarated by its defeat of the Persian invaders, came the formal perfection ofclassic art and architecture—the beauty and freedom of male sculpture, the grandyet humanistic proportions of the Parthenon. The Oresteia proclaims Apollo’striumph over chthonian nature. Fifty years later, after Athens’ decline andfall, Euripides answers each of Aeschylus’ Apollonian assertions. The Bacchae isa point-by-point refutation of the Oresteia. The Apollonian house that Athensbuilt is demolished by a wave of chthonian superpower. Dionysus, the invaderfrom the east, succeeds where the Persians failed. Sky-cult topples back intothe earth-cult.Aeschylus makes the ancient legend of the House of Atreus a metaphor for thebirth of civilization out of barbarism. For him, history is progress; in thisrespect, he is the first liberal. Unfortunately for women, the ideal of Atheniandemocracy celebrated by the Oresteia requires a defeat of female power. Modernreaders may not catch the chutzpah in Aeschylus’ local boosterism: his steeringof a Homeric saga toward his hometown (a mere hamlet in the Iliad) is like anAmerican poet making the Knights of the Round Table emigrate to New York. ButAeschylus was right. The coming decades were to be a peak moment in worldhistory, a burst of creativity accompanied by institutionalized misogyny. Womenplayed no part in Athenian high culture. They could not vote, attend thetheater, or walk in the stoa talking philosophy. But the male orientation ofclassical Athens was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great notdespite but because of its misogyny. Male homosexuality played a similarcatalytic role in Renaissance Florence and Elizabethan London. At such moments,male bonding enjoys an amorous intensity of self-assurance, a transientconviction of victory over mothers and nature. For 2,500 years, western culturehas fed itself on the enormous achievements of homosexual hybris, small bands ofmen attaining visionary heights in a few concentrated years of exaltation anddefiance.The Oresteia recapitulates history, moving from nature to society, from chaos toorder, from emotion to reason, from revenge to justice, from female to male.Father kills daughter; wife kills husband; son kills mother. Who is guilty, whoinnocent? The competing claims, weighed by an Athenian tribunal, produce a tievote. It is broken by Athena, the warrior-androgyne, who unexpectedly endorsesmale rule on the grounds that she is motherless, born from her father alone.Athens’ patron is the armoured woman, a female hard-body, without chthonianinteriority. Athena seals up the womb-space of mother nature. She closes theOresteia in two senses, just as Clytemnestra opens it. Athena is the Apolloniananswer to the problem of woman dogging every man.The first words of male-willed Clytemnestra evoke the ancient power of fertile“mother night” (Ag. 265). She stands for female rights, the priority of motherover son and wife over husband. Unlike Homer, Aeschylus makes Aegisthus agigolo, lesser consort of a goddess-queen. The Furies, Clytemnestra’s hellhoundavengers, are daemonic spirits of earth-cult, black as their mother night. Theyare ugly. They offend the eye. The Furies are snake-crowned hags, eyes drippingpus. Apollo and his priestess cannot stand to look at them: he banishes them totheir home of “beheadings, torn-out eyes, cut throats, castration, mutilation,stoning, and impalement” (Eum. 186–90). The Furies come from the realm ofDionysian sparagmos or ritual dismemberment. The chthonian annihilates form andobliterates the eye. The Furies complain of lack of respect from the Olympian“whelps,” young gods wet behind the ears. History stirs from nature’s grasp.Apollo, the solar eye, has broken free of mother night.The Oresteia shows that society is a defense against nature. Everythingintelligible—institutions, objects, persons, ideas—is the result of Apollonianclarification, adjudication, and action. Western politics, science, psychology,and art are creations of arrogant Apollo. Through every century, winning orlosing, western mind has struggled to keep nature at bay. The Oresteia’s sexisttransition from matriarchy to patriarchy records the rebellion every imaginationmust make against nature. Without that rebellion, we as a species are condemnedto regression or stasis. Even rebelling, we cannot get far. But all vying withfate is godlike.The Oresteia’s sexism was the first shock wave of Greek conceptualism. Art andarchitecture had near to hand the Egyptian formalism of stone column andsculpture, which had been slowly developing through the Archaic era. Philosophysuddenly emerged from pre-Socratic physics. Aeschylus’ Apollonian trilogyinaugurated the golden age of classicism. Greek tragedy is a conceptual cage inwhich Dionysus, founder of theater, is caught. A play is an anxiety-formationfreezing his barbaric Protean energy. At the end of the Oresteia the Furies,cleansed of the chthonian, become Eumenides, “Kindly Ones,” Athens’ benevolentguardians. Greek tragedy is an Apollonian prayer, stifling nature’s amoralappetite. It works only while society coheres. When the center does not hold,tragedy disintegrates. Dionysus is the mist slipping through society’s cracks.After 431 B.C., Athens was humiliated by plague, the failed Sicilian expedition,and defeat by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Idealism and sense of missionwere gone. Apollonian clarity and perfection were no longer possible. Euripides’Bacchae, emerging from the city’s self-doubt and self-criticism, satiricallyreverses the Oresteia: chthonian nature, which Aeschylus defeats, rebounds withterrible force. Dionysus makes landfall at Thebes, site of Sophocles’ greatestplay. Euripides rewrites his precursors’ central statements. Teiresias, who inSophocles warns Oedipus to seek Apollonian illumination, now warns Pentheus theother way. Again, Teiresias is the sexual track along which the protagonistmoves to destruction. Oedipus’ twenty-four-hour transformation fromhypermasculine hero to maimed sufferer is echoed by Pentheus’ transformationfrom strutting young buck to drag queen to shredded corpse.The Oresteia begins with a signal fire bouncing from summit to summit, Troy toArgos. Clytemnestra’s device to learn of Troy’s fall, it is the flame of ragepassing from that war to this. It is the murderous chain of causality, thebloodline of three generations of the House of Atreus, like the red carpet trodby Agamemnon, the stream of his own blood. The flare is also the poetic flamepassing from Homer to Aeschylus, a cultural shift of genres from epic totragedy. The third play of the Oresteia opens by mirroring the first.Transmission over time: Apollo’s priestess, the Pythoness, recites Delphi’sownership from Mother Earth to Apollo, earth-cult to sky-cult, prefiguring theOlympians’ neutralization of the Furies. Aeschylus’ brilliant movements, lofty,systematic, and historical, are parodied by the Bacchae. Greece again catchesfire from Asia, but for apocalypse, not evolution. History moves backwards,civilization relapsing into nature. Dionysus leads barbarian hordes ofmarauders: Thebes is first, with all of Greece ahead. Teiresias prophesies,flouting Aeschylus’ Pythoness, that Dionysus will leap the crags at Delphi. TheBacchae is a demolition derby, a catastrophe saga. And all fall down. Dionysusthe invader is plague, fire, and flood, the titan of nature unbound.The Oresteia is Freudian psychodrama. Orestes, young ego, is swamped by the idof the Furies, until superego Apollo puts them in their place. Aeschylus makesan analogy between society and personality. The Bacchae disfigures society’sApollonian constructions. Dionysus is nature’s raw sex and violence. He isdrugs, drink, dance—the dance of death. My generation of the Sixties may be thefirst since antiquity to have had so direct an experience of Dionysus. TheBacchae is our story, a panorama of intoxication, delusion, andself-destruction. Rock music is the naked power of Dionysus as Bromios, “theThunderer.” In the Bacchae, Apollonian sky-cult and political authority arebankrupt. Society is in its late or decadent phase. The ruling hierarchyconsists of the senile and the adolescent. Pentheus is like Homer’s callowsuitors, a lost generation of pampered dandies unseasoned by war and adventure.Heir rather than founder, he is bully and braggart. Thebes is a moral vacuuminto which Dionysus surges. He is a return of the repressed, the id ofAeschylus’ Furies bursting from bondage.Chronicling the birth of a religion out of the collapse of the old, the Bacchaestrangely prefigures the New Testament. Four hundred years before Christ,Euripides depicts the conflict between armed authority and a popular cult. Along-haired nonconformist, claiming to be the son of God by a human woman,arrives at the capital city with a mob of scruffy disciples, outlandishprovincials. Are the palms of Jesus’ march on Jerusalem a version of Dionysianthyrsi, potent pine wands? The demigod is arrested, interrogated, mocked,imprisoned. He offers no resistance, mildly yielding to his persecutors. Hisfollowers, like St. Peter, escape when their chains magically fall off. A ritualvictim, symbolizing the god, is lofted onto a tree, then slaughtered and hisbody torn to bits. An earthquake levels the royal palace, like the earthquakeduring Jesus’ crucifixion that tears the Temple veil, symbol of the old order.Both gods are beloved of women and expand their rights. The play identifiestransvestite Dionysus with the mother goddesses Cybele and Demeter. He avengeshis mother’s defamation by maddening her sister Agave into infanticide. Agave,cavorting onstage with her bloody trophy, cradles the severed head of her sonPentheus in a grisly mock-pietà. Against her will, she mimes murderous mothernature.Euripides shows what is excluded from the supposed universality of Atheniantragedy. Dionysus’ eerie smile, playful and cruel, gives the lie to tragedy’shigh seriousness. The salacious voyeurism into which Dionysus lures Pentheus maybe Euripides’ comment on the moral evasions of theater—the perverse voyeurism ofthe audience, the residue of untransformed barbarism in tragedy’s deaths anddisasters. The Bacchae’s messenger speeches are crammed with grotesque andmiraculous detail. Wild Maenads, girt with writhing snakes, give suck to wolvesand gazelles. Water, wine, and milk pour from the soil. Women tear cattle tobits with bare hands. Snakes lick splattered blood from cheeks. DismemberingPentheus, the Maenads play ball with his arms, feet, and ribs. Agave, foaming atthe mouth, impales his head on her wand. In these savage, sportive speeches welook directly into daemonic fantasy, the hellish nightscape of dream andcreative imagination. Shapeshifting Dionysus, who is bull, snake, lion,dissolves the Apollonian borderlines between objects and beings. He is ample,indiscriminate, all-engulfing.The Bacchae deconstructs western personality. Pentheus, brought onstage in partson a stretcher, has gone to pieces. He is shattered. He has lost his head. Wespeak of falling apart, having a breakdown, getting on top of things, getting itall together. Only in the west is there such conviction of the Apollonian unityof personality, hierarchically tidy and task-oriented. Turning Pentheus from awarrior calling for his armour to a drag queen primping with her hem, Dionysusmelts the west’s armoured ego in moral and sexual ambivalence. The Bacchaereturns drama to its severe ritual origins. What Aeschylus seized for Apollo,Euripides returns, bloodstained, to Dionysus.Tragedy springs from the clash between Apollo and Dionysus. Apollonian order,harmony, and light make a clear space in nature where the individual voice canbe heard. Apollo is a lawgiver; Dionysus is beyond the law. Tragedy fades tomelodrama when the individual becomes greater than the state. Lyric, inventedearlier by the Greeks, is the genre of private experience. When lyric invadestragedy, a public mode, tragedy is over. Tragedy makes sightlines, a mathematicof social space. Greek theater formalizes the eye-relations of group or polis:it captures and distances Dionysus, binding down nature to be looked at andtherefore cleansed. The extreme visibility of the elegant Parthenon, poised onthe crest of the Acropolis, hovers above the ritual visibilities of the Theaterof Dionysus, carved from the cliffside below. The Parthenon and the Oresteiawere born simultaneously as Apollonian ideas. To see, and to conquer by seeing.The rites of Dionysus, as depicted in the Bacchae, were participatory andfree-form, to the point of chaos. The conversion of bacchanal into liturgyhappened at Athens. The Greek drive for Apollonian conceptualization madeprogram and structure out of the spring fertility festival of Dionysus. Greektheater was an exercise of the eye. The audience, sitting and looking, wasstrengthening the cultural suppression of chthonian nature. It was intensifyingeye and mind in their war with the body.Apollo is the western eye victorious. Dionysus, I noted, is visceral andspasmodic: he is eating and feeling. Sparagmos is nature chewing, reducingobjects to the soupy primeval swamp. On the temple pediment at Olympia, Apolloflings out his arm to quell the roiling centaurs, a wedding party broken intoriot and rape. This fascist gesture is also made by the Apollo Belvedere,following his arrow with his eye. Apollo’s outstretched arm is the horizon lineof sky-cult. It is the piercing sightline of the aggressive western eye, thestraight line invented by Egypt as a correction of mother nature’s sexy curves.At Olympia, the Apollonian straight arm suppresses the tacky tumult of chthoniannature. Apollo is superego grandly subduing the libidinous id, as in theOresteia. The centaurs are man’s animal impulses, controlled by social form.Half horse, they symbolize Dionysian metamorphosis.Dionysus charges matter with motion and energy: objects are alive, and peopleare bestial. Apollo freezes the living into objects of art or contemplation.Apollonian objectification is fascist but sublime, enlarging human power againstthe tyranny of nature. Apollo’s western eye gives us identity by making usvisible. His outstretched arm reappears in Renaissance court ritual, preservedin classical ballet. Extension of the arm, needed to escort a woman in a hoopskirt, is activation of the upper body. It is literally courtly; that is, itcreates a visible, hierarchic social space, the artistic arena in which balletstill moves. The Caucasian “line” of the dancer’s body is Apollo’s hard incisededge. His outflung arm represents head and upper body rebelling againstchthonian pelvicism. Remember the hip-heavy Venus of Willendorf’s shrivelledarms. Dionysus, with his Maenadic night rites, is the body as internalwomb-space, tunneled for eating and procreating. Apollo, haughty, severe, andjudgmental, makes the plane of the eye by which we rise above our murky bodies.Apollonian form was derived from Egypt but perfected in Greece. Coleridge says,“The Greeks idolized the finite,” while Northern Europeans have “a tendency tothe infinite.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note1a] Spengler similarly identifies themodern “Faustian soul” with “pure and limitless space.” Following Nietzsche, hecalls the Apollonian “the principle of visible limits” and applies it to theGreek city-state: “All that lay beyond the visual range of this political atomwas alien.” The Greek statue, “the empirical visible body,” symbolizes classicalreality: “the material, the optically definite, the comprehensible, theimmediately present.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note2a] The Greeks were, in myphrase, visionary materialists. They saw things and persons hard and glittery,radiant with Apollonian glamour. We know the Maenadic Dionysus mainly throughthe impressionistic medium of Archaic vase painting. He appears in statue formonly when he loses his beard and female garb and turns ephebic Olympian, in thefifth century and after. High classic Athenian culture is based on Apolloniandefinitiveness and externality. “The whole tendency of Greek philosophy afterPlato,” remarks Gilbert Murray, “was away from the outer world towards the worldof the soul.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note3a] The shift of Greek thought fromouter to inner parallels the shift in art from the male to the female nude, fromhomosexual to heterosexual taste. Spengler says of Greek society, “What was faraway, invisible, was ipso facto ‘not there’.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note4a] Icited Karen Horney’s observation that a woman cannot see her own genitals. TheGreek world-view was predicated on the model of absolute outwardness of male sexorgans. Athenian culture flourished in externalities, the open air of the agoraand the nudity of the palestra. There are no female nudes in major fifth-centuryart because female sexuality was imaginatively “not there,” buried like theFuries turned Eumenides. To the old complaint that the Greeks gave their statuesthe genitals of little boys, one could reply that the male nude offers the wholebody as a projected genital. The modestly stooping Knidian Aphrodite marks theturn toward spiritual and sexual internality. It is the end of Apollo.Kalokagathia, the beautiful and (or as) the good, was implicit in the Greekworld-view from the start. Apollonian idealization of form was already presentin Homer, while the visual arts were still groping toward a style. Homer’scinematic pictorialism put armoured western personality on the literary map.Jane Harrison suggestively refers, without elaboration, to “the Homeric horrorof formlessness.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note5a] I find this horror in theIliad’s epic battle between Achilles and the river Scamander, a strange episodewhich oscillates surreally between terror and comedy. The river is in a fluidhalf-state of identity, a personification dilating and contracting at will. Itthinks and speaks like a demigod, then diffuses into the immensity of naturalforce, beyond human scale. Greek Archaic art tucked sprightly river or wind godsinto the corner of temple pediments. They are gleeful twisty creatures, a man’sface and torso ending in a blue corkscrew. Homer’s Scamander is good-natured buteasily provoked. It protests its defilement with blood and gore by raveningAchilles. There is a long test of wills. Weapons are useless against the“foaming cataracts” and “black wall of water.” Achilles is buried in a “mightybillow,” the earth swept from beneath his feet.6 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note6a]The episode passes in nightmare slow motion. Human size, human strength are notenough. Achilles survives only because Hephaestus intervenes, scalding the riverwith fire and turning it to steam. It is a war of the elements. Only nature canfight nature. The scene switches to Olympus, where the gods are in a rumpus.Ares, Athena, Aphrodite, Artemis, and Hera fling insults and cuff each otherabout, while Zeus laughs in delight. This book of the Iliad is an allegoricaltableau in which formlessness opposes form. It recapitulates the birth of objectand person out of the capricious flux of nature. Identity is imperiled butfights its way to visibility and freedom. The Olympian gods, with their radiantspecificity, culminate the evolution of form. Sharp words, sharp blows: the godsare hard; they wear the body-armour of Apollonian contour. Fright turns tolaughter. The war of man and nature ends in the charm of sky-cult. Homer bringsform out of the flood of chthonian darkness.The moral principle of Greek paganism, I propose, was reverence for theintegrity of the human form. About to bestow immortality upon her favorite,Tydeus, Athena was repulsed by his brutish death: in his last agony, he brokeopen the skull of his enemy, Melanippus, and devoured his brains. Apollonianismis unity and purity of form. Through her many disguises, Athena has a pristinepersona, an untouched Apollonian cell of self to which she always returns.Dionysus, on the other hand, is truly Protean, the sum of his tumbling roles. InHomer, Athena may zestfully zip about, but in Athens she stands still. The twocolossi of the Acropolis showed her in regal Apollonian stasis. Even her hand,perch of a winged Victory, rested on a pedestal. High classic figures have aserene equilibrium of face and posture. Their Apollonian contour keepspersonality in and nature out.Euripides, shrewd charter of Greek decline, shows Homer’s chthonian river in newflood. Like the Bacchae, Medea uses Greek legend to symbolize the fall ofApollonian Athens. Within a year of its production, the city was ravaged by aplague that put the ugliness, vulgarity, and passivity of the human body onpublic display. Thus ended, I say, Athens’ Apollonian idealizations. Ephebicmale beauty had an Achilles heel, where the hand of mother nature grips us. Anamazing passage in Medea prophetically depicts profanation of the human form byrepressed forces beneath and beyond Greek culture. Foreign Medea, spurned byJason, sends poisoned wedding gifts to his bride, daughter of the king ofCorinth. The death of princess and king is one of the most horrifying scenes inliterature. A messenger describes the girl receiving and donning the fancy robesand diadem. She smugly pats her hair, smiling in the mirror; she parades throughher chambers, looking herself up and down. Suddenly, she trembles and staggers.A double plague assailed her. The golden diadem on her head emitted a strangeflow of devouring fire, while the fine robes were eating up the poor girl’swhite flesh. All aflame, she jumps from her seat and flees, shaking her head andhair this way and that, trying to throw off the crown. But the golden band heldfirmly, and after she had shaken her hair more violently, the fire began toblaze twice as fiercely. Overcome by the agony she falls on the ground, and nonebut her father could have recognized her. The position of her eyes could not bedistinguished, nor the beauty of her face. The blood, clotted with fire, drippedfrom the crown of her head, and the flesh melted from her bones, like resin froma pine tree, as the poisons ate their unseen way. It was a fearful sight. Allwere afraid to touch the corpse, taught by what had happened to her.The king rushes in. Weeping and lamenting, he throws himself on his daughter’sbody, embracing and kissing her. When he tries to stand up:He stuck to the fine robes, like ivy to a laurel bush. His struggles werehorrible. He would try to free a leg, but the girl’s body stuck to his. And ifhe pulled violently, he tore his shrunken flesh off his bones. At last his lifewent out; doomed, he gave up the ghost. Side by side lie the two bodies,daughter and old father.7 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note7a]We listen to the messenger’s eloquent formal speech with a stunned combinationof admiration and physical revulsion. It is a daemonic aria, a flight ofdecadent imagination. The princess is simply a cipher. Nameless, she neverappears in the play. But Euripides has particularized her execution withterrible and uncanny detail, threatening our sympathy for his plaintiffprotagonist. Medea, gifted niece of the sorceress Circe, is a vehicle ofchthonian disorder. She is a metamorphosist who can change gold to dross, joy tohorror.The scene prefigures the transition in Greek art from high classicism toHellenistic style. Father tangled with daughter is like Laocoön dying with hisstrangled sons. The Apollonian borders of the body are burst through. Thepassage’s emotional power comes from the brutal contrast between the princess’ssmirking vanity and the sudden melting of her features beyond recognition.Holocaust and apocalypse. She stands at ground zero, incinerated by a distantinvader. Primping princess is sister to primping Pentheus, self-intoxicated inthe electric moment before lightning strikes. Mirror, crown, palace: theprincess is Apollonian selfhood and social hierarchy. For the feministEuripides, looking backward at Pheidian Athens as Aeschylus looked forward,Greek sexual personae are shallow and conventional. Fatuous Jason, like thesegregated Athenian audience, makes rigid definitions of male and female. Theclotheshorse princess falls victim to chthonian overflow. The Apollonianprincipium individuationis of father and daughter are abolished. Tossing herflaming head, the princess is goaded into a Maenadic dance of death. Her fleshmelts “like resin from a pine tree”: she runs with Dionysian fluids. Theprincess dies by the sedition of her own body, upon which her father iscrucified, like Pentheus on the fir tree. Flesh torn in sparagmos, they liescorched by ecstasy and annihilation.Euripides makes two planes of reality collide. Into the world of glitteringApollonian appearances springs a form-dissolving fountain of chthonian force,erupting from primeval chaos. The intelligible momentarily loses to theirrational, manifested as a fiery lava flow cruelly generated by the human bodyitself. The king, trapped by his tar-baby daughter, turns into the gummy log ofHamlet senior, a crusted corpse in a garden. Euripides destroys the Oresteia’spsychodrama: when the princess as young ego is swamped by id, no Apollo rides tothe rescue. The chthonian triumphs in Medea, as in the later Bacchae. The twoplays are symmetrical: citizenship is denied to a sexually ambiguous,magic-working alien, who vengefully debases and liquidates society’s arroganthierarchs.Euripides savors the sexually grotesque. King and blinded princess cleavetogether in a parody of union, a reply to Sophocles’ incest-drama. Male-willedMedea, who slaughters her children, dismembers her brother, and dupes Pelias’daughters into killing their father, spreads perversion like a plague. As aScythian witch, she can violate the unconscious of her victims. In this tour deforce of sadomasochistic description, Euripides shows Greek culture in mentaland physical breakdown. Spengler says, “‘Soul’ for the real Hellene was in lastanalysis the form of his body.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note8a] The princess’meltdown of face and flesh dissolves what neurologists call the proprioceptivesense, by which we know ourselves in the concrete world. Personality is palpableand visible, an Apollonian self-projection. Zevedei Barbu says ofschizophrenics, “The disintegration of the self seems to be related to thedeterioration of the perception of form.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note9a] InMedea, body-image disintegrates as society self-destructs. Form is created bythe Apollonian eye: King Creon’s lament over his mutilated daughter is thereforean elegy for Athenian high classicism.The Athenian cult of beauty had a supreme theme: the beautiful boy. Euripides,the first decadent artist, substitutes a bloody moon for the golden Apolloniansun. Medea is Athens’ worst nightmare about women. She is nature’s revenge,Euripides’ dark answer to the beautiful boy.Though the homosexuality of Greek high culture has been perfectly obvious sinceWinckelmann, the facts have been suppressed or magnified, depending on periodand point of view. Late nineteenth-century aestheticism, for example, was fullof heady effusions about “Greek love.” Yet Harvard’s green and red Loeb Librarytranslations of classical literature, published early this century, are heavilycensored. The pendulum has now swung toward realism. In Greek Homosexuality(1978), K. J. Dover wittily reconstructs from the evidence of vase painting theactual mechanics of sexual practice. But I depart from sociological rationalesfor Greek love. For me, aesthetics are primary. The Athenian turn away fromwomen toward boys was a brilliant act of conceptualization. Unjust andultimately self-thwarting, it was nevertheless a crucial movement in theformation of western culture and identity.The Greek beautiful boy, as I remarked earlier, is one of the west’s greatsexual personae. Like Artemis, he has no exact equivalent in other cultures. Hiscult returns whenever Apollonianism rebounds, as in Italian Renaissance art. Thebeautiful boy is an androgyne, luminously masculine and feminine. He has malemuscle structure but a dewy girlishness. In Greece he inhabited the world ofhard masculine action. His body was on view, striving nude in the palestra.Greek athletics, like Greek law, were theater, a public agon. They imposedmathematics on nature: how fast? how far? how strong? The beautiful boy was thefocus of Apollonian space. All eyes were on him. His broad-shouldered,narrow-waisted body was a masterwork of Apollonian articulation, every musclegroup edged and contoured. There was even a ropy new muscle, looping the hipsand genitals. Classic Athens found the fatty female body unbeautiful, because itwas not a visible instrument of action. The beautiful boy is Adonis, the GreatMother’s son-lover, now removed from nature and cleansed of the chthonian. LikeAthena, he is reborn through males and clad in the Apollonian armour of his ownhard body.Major Greek art begins in the late seventh century B.C. with the Archaic kouros(“youth”), a more than life-size nude statue of a victorious athlete (fig. 12[ch04.html#ch04fig12]). He is monumental human assertion, imagined in Apollonianstillness. He stands like Pharaoh, fists clenched and one foot forward. ButGreek artists wanted their work to breathe and move. What was unchanged forthousands of years in Egypt leaps to life in a single century. The muscles curveand swell; the heavy wiglike hair curls and tufts. The smiling kouros is thefirst fully free-standing sculpture in art. Strict Egyptian symmetry waspreserved until the early classic Kritios Boy, who looks one way while shiftinghis weight to the opposite leg (fig. 13 [ch04.html#ch04fig13]). In the brokenrecord of Greek artifacts, the Kritios Boy is the last kouros. He is not a typebut a real boy, serious and regal. His smooth, shapely body has a whitesensuality. The Archaic kouros was always callipygian, the large buttocks morestressed and valued than the face. But the buttocks of the Kritios Boy have afeminine refinement, as erotic as breasts in Venetian painting. The contrappostoflexes one buttock and relaxes the other. The artist imagines them as apple andpear, glowing and compact.Image [../images/f0111-01.jpg]12. New York Kouros, ca. 600 B.C.For three hundred years, Greek art is filled with beautiful boys, in stone andbronze. We know the name of none of them. The old-fashioned generic term,“Apollo,” had a certain wisdom, for the solitary, self-supporting kouros was anApollonian idea, a liberation of the eye. His nudity was polemical. The Archaickore (“maiden”) was always clothed and utilitarian, one hand proffering a votiveplate. The kouros stands heroically bare in Apollonian externality andvisibility. Unlike two-dimensional pharaonic sculptures, he invites thestrolling spectator to admire him in the round. He is not king or god but humanyouth. Divinity and stardom fall upon the beautiful boy. Epiphany is secularizedand personality ritualized. The kouros records the first cult of personality inwestern history. It is an icon of the worship of beauty, a hierarchismself-generated rather than dynastic.The kouros bore strange fruit. From its bold clarity and unity of design cameall major Greek sculpture, by the fourth century female as well as male.Hellenic art spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean as Hellenistic art.From that grew medieval Byzantine art in Greece, Turkey, and Italy, with itsdour mosaic icons of Christ, Virgin, and saint (fig. 14 [ch04.html#ch04fig14]).The Italian Renaissance begins in the Byzantine style. Thus there is a directartistic line from Archaic Greek kouroi to the standing saints of Italianaltarpieces and the stained-glass windows of Gothic cathedrals. Homoeroticiconicism goes full circle in the popular Italian theme, St. Sebastian, abeautiful seminude youth pierced by phallic arrows (fig. 15[ch04.html#ch04fig15]). Those arrows are glances of the aggressive western eye,solar shafts of Apollo the archer. The Greek kouros, inheriting Egypt’s coldApollonian eye, created the great western fusion of sex, power, and personality.Image [../images/f0112-01.jpg]13. The Kritios Boy, ca. 480 B.C.Image [../images/f0113-01.jpg]14. Byzantine Saints, 1138–1148.Image [../images/f0114-01.jpg]15. Sandro Botticelli, St. Sebastian, 1474.In Greece the beautiful boy was always beardless, frozen in time. At manhood, hebecame a lover of boys himself. The Greek boy, like the Christian saint, was amartyr, victim of nature’s tyranny. His beauty could not last and so was caughtfull-flower by Apollonian sculpture. There are hundreds of pots, shards, andgraffiti hailing so-and-so kalos, “the beautiful,” flirtatious public praise ofmales by males. Dover demonstrates the criteria governing depiction of malegenitalia, opposite to ours: a small thin penis was fashionable, a large penisvulgar and animalistic. Even brawny Hercules was shown with boy’s genitals.Therefore, despite its political patriarchy, Athens cannot be considered—horridword—a phallocracy. On the contrary, the Greek penis was edited down from anexclamation point to a dash. The beautiful boy was desired but not desiring. Heoccupied a presexual or suprasexual dimension, the Greek aesthetic ideal. Inconvention, his adult admirer could seek orgasm, while he remained unaroused.The beautiful boy was an adolescent, hovering between a female past and malefuture. J. H. Van den Berg claims the eighteenth century invented adolescence.10[ch25_notes.html#ch04note10a] It is true children once passed more directly intoadult responsibilities than they do now. In Catholicism, for example, seven isthe dawn of moral consciousness. After one’s First Communion, it’s hell or highwater. Brooding identity crises were indeed the Romantic creations of Rousseauand Goethe. But Van den Berg is wrong to make adolescence entirely modern. TheGreeks saw it and formalized it in art. Greek pederasty honored the eroticmagnetism of male adolescents in a way that today brings the police to the door.Children are more conscious and perverse than parents like to think. I agreewith Bruce Benderson that children can and do choose. The adolescent male, onestep over puberty, is dreamy and removed, oscillating between vigor and languor.He is a girl-boy, masculinity shimmering and blurred, as if seen through acloudy fragment of ancient glass. J. Z. Eglinton cites images of youthful“bloom” in Greek poetry: “The adolescent in bloom is a synthesis of male andfemale beauties.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note11a] The slightly older ephebosgained in gravity but retained a half-feminine glamour. We see it in thepedimental Apollo, the Delphic Charioteer, the bronze Apollo at Chatsworth, thewhite-lekythos Eretrian warrior seated before a gravestone. These youths have adistinctly ancient Greek face: high brow, strong straight nose, girlishly fleshycheeks, full petulant mouth, and short upper lip. It is the face of ElvisPresley, Lord Byron, and Bronzino’s glossy Mannerist blue boy. Freud saw theandrogyny in the Greek adolescent: “Among the Greeks, where the most manly menwere found among inverts, it is quite obvious that it was not the masculinecharacter of the boy which kindled the love of man; it was his physicalresemblance to woman as well as his feminine psychic qualities, such as shyness,demureness, and the need of instruction and help.”12[ch25_notes.html#ch04note12a] Certain boys, especially blondes, seem to carryadolescent beauty into adulthood. They form an enduring class of homosexualtaste that I call the Billy Budd topos, fresh, active, and ephebic.The beautiful boy is the Greek angel, a celestial visitor from the Apollonianrealm. His purity is inadvertently revealed in Joseph Campbell’s negativecritique of fifth-century Athens: “Everything that we read of it has a wonderfuladolescent atmosphere of opalescent, timeless skies—untouched by the vulgarseriousness of a heterosexual commitment to mere life. The art, too, of thelovely standing nude, for all its grace and charm, is finally neuter—like thevoice of a singing boy.” Campbell quotes Heinrich Zimmer’s praise of the“heterosexual flavor” and yogic awareness of Hindu sculpture: “Greek art wasderived from experiences of the eye; Hindu from those of the circulation of theblood.”13 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note13a] Campbell’s “neuter” is a blank, a moralnothing. But the beautiful boy’s androgyny is visionary and exalted. Let us takeCampbell’s own example, “the voice of a singing boy.” In a Seraphim recording ofFauré’s Requiem that substitutes the King’s College choir for the usual women,the treble parts are taken by boys from eight to thirteen. Alec Robertson’sreview seeks a tonality of emotion for which our only language is religious:boys’ voices “add an unforgettable radiance and serenity to their part,impossible to sopranos, however good”; the soloist’s singing has “an etherealbeauty that no words can describe.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note14a] The rosyEnglish or Austrian choirboy, disciplined, reserved, and heart-stoppinglybeautiful, is a symbol of spiritual and sexual illumination, fused in theidealizing Greek manner. We see the same thing in Botticelli’s exquisitelong-haired boy-angels. These days, especially in America, boy-love is not onlyscandalous and criminal but somehow in bad taste. On the evening news, one seeshandcuffed teachers, priests, or Boy Scout leaders hustled into police vans.Therapists call them maladjusted, emotionally immature. But beauty has its ownlaws, inconsistent with Christian morality. As a woman, I feel free to protestthat men today are pilloried for something that was rational and honorable inGreece at the height of civilization.The Greek beautiful boy was a living idol of the Apollonian eye. As a sexualpersona, the kouros represents that tense relation betweeen eye and object thatI saw in Nefertiti and that was absent in the Venus of Willendorf, with hereasy, forgiving, spongy female amplitude. Zimmer correctly opposes heterosexualHindu “circulation of the blood” to Greek aesthetics of the eye. The beautifulboy is a rebuke to mother nature, an escape from the labyrinth of the body, withits murky womb and bowels. Woman is the Dionysian miasma, the world of fluids,the chthonian swamp of generation. Athens, says Campbell, was “untouched by thevulgar seriousness of a heterosexual commitment to mere life.” Yes, mere life isindeed rejected by the idealizing Apollonian mode. It is the divine humanprivilege to make ideas greater than nature. We are born into the indignities ofthe body, with its relentless inner movements pushing us moment by moment towarddeath. Greek Apollonianism, freezing the human form into absolute maleexternality, is a triumph of mind over matter. Apollo, slaying the Python atDelphi, the navel of the world, halts the flood of time, for the coiled serpentwe carry in our abdomen is the eternal wave-motion of female fluidity. Everybeautiful boy is an Icarus seeking the Apollonian sun. He escapes the labyrinthonly to fall into nature’s sea of dissolution.Cults of beauty have been persistently homosexual from antiquity to today’s hairsalons and houses of couture. Professional beautification of women by homosexualmen is a systematic reconceptualizing of the brute facts of female nature. As atthe nineteenth-century fin de siècle, the aesthete is always male, never female.There is no lesbian parallel to Greek worship of the adolescent. The greatSappho may have fallen in love with girls, but to all evidence she internalizedrather than externalized her passions. Her most famous poem invents the hostiledistance between sexual personae that will have so long a history in westernlove poetry. Gazing across a room at her beloved sitting with a man, she suffersa physical convulsion of jealousy, humiliation, and helpless resignation. Thisseparation is not the aesthetic distance of Apollonian Athens but a desert ofemotional deprivation. It is a gap that can be closed—as Aphrodite laughinglypromises Sappho in another poem. Lascivious delectation of the eye isconspicuously missing in female eroticism. Visionary idealism is a male artform. The lesbian aesthete does not exist. But if there were one, she would havelearned from the perverse male mind. The eye-intense pursuit of beauty is anApollonian correction of life in our mother-born bodies.The beautiful boy, suspended in time, is physicality without physiology. He doesnot eat, drink, or reproduce. Dionysus is deeply immersed in time—rhythm, music,dance, drunkenness, gluttony, orgy. The beautiful boy as angel floats above theturmoil of nature. Angels, in Judaism too, defy chthonian femaleness. This iswhy the angel, though sexless, is always a youthful male. Eastern religion doesnot have our angels of incorporeal purity, for two reasons. A “messenger”(angelos) or mediator between the divine and human is unnecessary, since the tworealms are coexistent. Second, eastern femaleness is symbolically equivalent toand harmonious with maleness—though this has never improved real women’s socialstatus.The pink-cheeked beautiful boy is emotional vernality, spring only. He is apartial statement about reality. He is exclusive, a product of aristocratictaste. He flees the superfluity of matter, the womb of female nature devouringand spewing out creatures. Dionysus, we noted, is “the Many,” all-inclusive andever-changing. Life’s totality is summer and winter, floridity and devastation.The Great Mother is both seasons in her benevolent and malevolent halves. If thebeautiful boy is pink and white, she is the red and purple of her labial maw.The beautiful boy represents a hopeless attempt to separate imagination fromdeath and decay. He is form seceding from form-making, natura naturata dreamingitself free of natura naturans. As an epiphany, eye-created, he binds up themany into a transient vision of the one, like art itself.Besides the Kritios Boy, the preeminent examples of this persona are the bronzeBenevento Boy of the Louvre (fig. 16 [ch04.html#ch04fig16]), the Antinoussculptures commissioned by the emperor Hadrian (fig. 17 [ch04.html#ch04fig17]),Donatello’s David, and Thomas Mann’s Tadzio in Death in Venice. The Apollonianis a mode of silence, suppressing rhythm to focus the eye. The beautiful boy,sexually self-complete, is sealed in silence, behind a wall of aristocraticdisdain. The adolescent dreaminess of the Antinous sculptures is not trueinwardness but a melancholy premonition of death. Antinous drowned, like Icarus.The beautiful boy dreams but neither thinks nor feels. His eyes fix on nothing.His face is a pale oval upon which nothing is written. A real person could notremain at this stage without decadence and mummification. The beautiful boy iscruel in his indifference, remoteness, and serene self-containment. We rarelysee these things in a girl, but when we do, as in the magnificent portraitphotographs of the young Virginia Woolf, we sense catatonia and autism.Narcissistic beauty in a postadolescent (like Hitchcock’s Marnie) may meanmalice and ruthlessness, a psychopathic amorality. There is danger in beauty.The beautiful boy has flowing or richly textured hyacinthine hair, the onlyluxuriance in this chastity. Long male hair, sometimes wrapped round the head,was an aristocratic fashion in Athens. Antinous’ thick hair is crisply layered,as in Van Dyck’s silky princes or Seventies rock stars. In its artful negligenceand allure, the hair traps the beholder’s eye. It is a nimbus, a pre-Christianhalo, scintillating with fiery flakes of stars. The beautiful boy, glitteringwith charisma, is matter transformed, penetrated by Apollonian light. Greekvisionary materialism makes hard crystal of our gross fleshiness. The beautifulboy is without motive force or deed; hence he is not a hero. Because of hisemotional detachment, he is not a heroine. He occupies an ideal space betweenmale and female, effect and affect. Like the Olympians, he is an objet d’art,which also affects without acting or being acted upon. The beautiful boy is theproduct of chance or destiny, a sport thrown up by the universe. He is, Isuggested, a secular saint. Light makes beautiful boys incandescent. Divinityswoops down to ennoble them, like the eagle falling upon Ganymede, who iskidnapped to Olympus, unlike the pack of female lovers like Leda whom Zeuscasually abandons as types of the generative mother.Image [../images/f0119-01.jpg]16.

Socrates says the man who gazes upon “a god-like countenance or physicalform,” a copy of “true beauty,” is overcome by a shudder of awe, “an unusualfever and perspiration”: “Beholding it, he reverences it as he would a god; andif he were not afraid of being accounted stark mad, he would offer sacrifice tothe beloved as to a holy image of divinity.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note15a]Beauty is the first step of a ladder leading to God. Writing in the fourthcentury about memories of the fifth, Plato is already postclassical. He issuspicious of art, which he banishes from his ideal republic. Visionarymaterialism has failed. In the Phaedrus, however, we still see the aestheticdistance vibrating between Greek personae. Plato has Sappho’s fever, but it iscooled by the dominating and dominated western eye. In Greece, beauty was sacredand ugliness or deformity hateful. When Odysseus bludgeons Thersites, a lame,hunchback commoner, Homer’s heroes laugh. Christ’s ministry to the lepers wasunthinkable in Greek terms. In the Greek cult of beauty, there was mysticalelevation and hierarchical submission, but significantly without moralobligation.The Greek principle of domination by the beautiful person as work of art isimplicit in western culture, rising to view at charged historical moments. I seeit in Dante and Beatrice and in Petrarch and Laura. There must be distance, ofspace or time. The eye elects a narcissistic personality as galvanizing objectand formalizes the relation in art. The artist imposes a hieratic sexualcharacter on the beloved, making himself the receptor (or more femininereceptacle) of the beloved’s mana. The structure is sadomasochistic. Westernsexual personae are hostile with dramatic tension. Naturalistically, Beatrice’sexpansion into a gigantic heavenly body is grandiose and even absurd, but sheachieves her preeminence through the poet’s sexually hierarchizing westernimagination. The aesthetic distance between personae is like a vacuum betweenpoles, discharging electric tension by a bolt of lightning. Little is known ofthe real Beatrice and Laura. But I think they resembled the beautiful boy ofhomosexual tradition: they were dreamy, remote, autistic, lost in a world ofandrogynous self-completion. Beatrice, after all, was barely eight when Dantefell in love with her in her crimson dress. Laura’s impenetrability inspired the“fire and ice” metaphor of Petrarch’s sonnets, which revolutionized Europeanpoetry. “Fire and ice” is western alchemy. It is the chills and fever ofSappho’s and Plato’s uncanny love experience. Agonized ambivalence of body andmind was Sappho’s contribution to poetry, imitated by Catullus and transmittedto us through folk ballads and pop torch songs. Western love, Denis de Rougemontshows, is unhappy or death-ridden. In Dante and Petrarch, self-frustrating loveis not neurotic but ritualistic and conceptualizing. The west makes art andthought out of the cold manipulation of our hard sexual personae.Domination by the beautiful personality is central to Romanticism, specificallyin its dark Coleridgean line passing-through Poe and Baudelaire to Wilde. ThePre-Raphaelite Dante Gabriel Rossetti, imitating his namesake, invented his ownBeatrice, the sickly Elizabeth Siddal, who obsessively appears throughout hiswork. That Siddal, like Beatrice and Laura, was a female version of thebeautiful boy is suggested by the speed with which her face turned into the faceof beautiful young men in the paintings of Rossetti’s disciple, EdwardBurne-Jones. The beautiful boy’s narcissistic remoteness and latent autismbecame somnambulism in Rossetti’s pensive Muse. Antinous, Beatrice, Laura, andElizabeth Siddal passed with ease into art because in their cool, untouchableimpersonality they already had the abstract removal of an objet d’art.Transcendance of sexual identity is the key.The bungling brooder, John Hinckley, infatuated with the boyish Jodie Foster,replicates Dante’s submission to distant Beatrice. Dante’s love was just aspreposterous, but he made poetry out of it. The untalented literalist, failingto recognize the aggression already inherent in the western eye, picks up a guninstead of a pen. The sexual ambiguity of Jodie Foster’s onscreen personasupports my point about Beatrice. The absence of moral obligation in this sexualreligiosity explains the amorality of aestheticism. Oscar Wilde believed thebeautiful person has absolute rights to commit any act. Beauty replaces moralityas the divine order. As Cocteau said, following Wilde, “The privileges of beautyare enormous.”The beautiful boy, the object of all eyes, looks downward or away or keeps hiseyes in soft focus because he does not recognize the reality of other persons orthings. By making the glamourous Alcibiades burst drunk into the Symposium,ending the intellectual debate, Plato is commenting in retrospect on thepolitical damage done to Athens by its fascination with beauty. Spoiled,captivating Alcibiades was to betray his city and end in exile and disgrace.When the beautiful boy leaves the realm of contemplation for the realm ofaction, the result is chaos and crime. Wilde’s Alcibiades, Dorian Gray, makes ascience of corruption. Refusing to accept the early death that preserved thebeauty of Adonis and Antinous, Dorian compacts with a fellow art object, hisportrait, projecting human mutability onto it. The ephebic Dorian is serene andheartless, the beautiful boy as destroyer. In Death in Venice, Mann’s homage toWilde, the beautiful boy does not even have to act to destroy. His blindingApollonian light is a radiation disintegrating the moral world.The beautiful boy is the representational paradigm of high classic Athens. He ispure Apollonian objectification, a public sex object. His lucid contour andhardness originate in Egypt’s monumental architectonics and in Homer’s gleamingOlympian sky-cult. The Apollonian beautiful boy dramatizes the special horror ofdissolved form to Pheidian Athens, with its passionate vision of the sunlithuman figure. Unity of image and unity of personality were the Athenian norm,satirized by Euripides in his chthonian dismemberments, symbol of fragmentationand multiplicity. The androgynous beautiful boy has an androgynous sponsor, themale-born Uranian Aphrodite whom Plato identifies with homosexual love. Whilethe Archaic kouros is vigorously masculine, the early and high classic beautifulboy perfectly harmonizes masculine and feminine. With the Hellenistic tilttoward women, prefigured by Euripides, the beautiful boy slides toward thefeminine, a symptom of decadence.Praxiteles registers this shift in his ephebic Hermes (ca. 350 B.C.), whichmisaligns the elegance of classic contrapposto. Hermes awkwardly leans away fromthe engaged leg rather than toward it, curving his hips in a peculiar swish. Hisarm, supporting infant Dionysus, rests heavily on a stump. Farnell says of thePraxitelean “languor,” “Even the gods are becoming fatigued.”16[ch25_notes.html#ch04note16a] Kenneth Clark finds in high classic Greek art aperfect “physical balance of strength and grace.”17[ch25_notes.html#ch04note17a] In the Hellenistic beautiful boy, grace drainsstrength. Rhys Carpenter sees Praxiteles’ Knidian Aphrodite as a sexualdegeneration of Polycleitus’ canonical fifth-century Doryphoros, a “languiddevitalization of the male victor-athlete into an equivalent feminine canon.”18[ch25_notes.html#ch04note18a] Hauser says of the Hermes and Lysippus’Apoxyomenos, “They give the impression of being dancers rather than athletes.”19[ch25_notes.html#ch04note19a] Jane Harrison denounces Praxiteles’ Hermes on thegrounds that as Kourotrophos (“boy-rearer”) he “usurps the function of themother”: “The man doing woman’s work has all the inherent futility and somethingof the ugly dissonance of the man masquerading in woman’s clothes.”20[ch25_notes.html#ch04note20a] Again, Harrison recognizes sexual duality butfinds it repugnant. Clark points out that wherever contrapposto appears in worldart, it shows Greek influence, even in India, to which it was carried byAlexander. Originally a male motif, it entered female iconography to become “avivid symbol of desire.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note21a] What seems overlookedis that contrapposto was erotic from the start, in the dignified exhibitionismof the early classic kouros. Hellenistic ephebes use a more extreme hip-shotpose, ripe with sexual solicitation. It is the street stance of harlot and dragqueen, ancient or modern. Male contrapposto with hand on hip, as in Donatello’sDavid, is provocative and epicene.Portraits of Dionysus illustrate the sensual feminization of male personae inGreek art. The Archaic transvestite Dionysus fuses a bearded adult man with asexually mature woman. In the fifth century, he loses his beard and becomesindistinguishable from the ephebic Apollo of the Parthenon frieze. TheHellenistic Dionysus is a voluptuously appealing beautiful boy. A third-centuryhead at Thasos could be mistaken for a woman, a movie queen, with thickshoulder-length hair and expectant parted lips. Scholars have generally beenrepelled by these beautiful objects, with their overt homoeroticism. Even MarieDelcourt, in her excellent study, Hermaphrodite, attacks the “effeminacy” of theHellenistic Dionysus, which “pandered” to Greek homosexual desire.22[ch25_notes.html#ch04note22a] But it was the Hellenistic Dionysus and Apollo whowere the androgynous models for the exquisite Antinous sculptures.The long, decentralized Hellenistic era was like our own time, lively, anxious,and sensationalistic. Hellenistic art teems with sex and violence. High classicGreek art honors ideal youth, while Hellenistic art is full of babies, brutes,and drunks. Athenian eroticism is pornographic in kitchen and tavern pottery butsublime and restrained in major sculpture. Hellenistic sculpture, on the otherhand, likes large-scale wrestling and rapine—massacre, pugilism, and priapism.Hellenistic sex is in such free flow that the gender of shattered statues can bedoubtful. Misidentifications have been common.Dover speaks of the change in homosexual taste in Athens from the fifth century,which glorified athletic physiques, to the fourth, when softer, passive minionscame into vogue. It is in the fourth century that the hermaphrodite firstappears in classical art. The plush creature with female breasts manages toexpose its male genitals, either by a slipping cloak or a tunic boldly raised inritual exhibitionism. The Sleeping Hermaphrodite influenced later art, likeeighteenth-century reclining female nudes. From one side, the drowsy figuredisplays ambiguously smooth buttocks and the half-swell of a breast; from theother, female breast and male genitals pop out clear as day. I found the VillaBorghese copy prudently pushed against the wall to discourage inspection! Thedecorative popularity of hermaphrodites is paradoxical, for everywhere inantiquity the birth of a real hermaphrodite was greeted with horror. Thiscondition, hypospadias, may be examined ad stuporem in the hundreds ofphotographs of Hugh Hampton Young’s pioneering text, Genital Abnormalities,Hermaphroditism, and Related Adrenal Diseases (1937). Since a hermaphroditebirth was a bad omen presaging war, disaster, or pestilence, the infant wasusually destroyed or left to die by exposure. As late as Paracelsus,hermaphroditic children were thought “monstrous signs of secret sins in theparents.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note23a] The annalist Diodorus Siculus, in theRoman era, records a case where an Arabian girl’s tumor burst open to revealmale genitals. She then changed her name, donned men’s clothes, and joined thecalvary.24 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note24a]The source of the Hermaphrodite legend is unknown. It may be a vestige of thesexual duality of early fertility deities of Asia Minor. Later storiesimprovised upon the name to claim he/she was the child of Hermes and Aphrodite.Ovid started a mythographic muddle with his version in the Metamorphoses,possibly based on a lost Alexandrian romance. The amorous nymph Salmacis trapsthe beautiful boy Hermaphroditus in her forest pool, entwining him with her armsand legs, until the gods grant her prayer to unite them into one being, likePlato’s primeval androgynes. The tale may have begun as a folk legend about acursed pool sapping the virility of men who bathed in it.Greek androgyny evolved from chthonian to Apollonian and back: vitalistic energyto godlike charisma to loss of manhood. I do not agree with the disparagement ofthe later androgyne by Jane Harrison and Marie Delcourt. Effeminate men havesuffered a bad press the world over. I accept decadence as a complex historicalmode. In late phases, maleness is always in retreat. Women have ironicallyenjoyed a greater symbolic, if not practical freedom. Thus it is that male andnot female homosexuality has usually been harshly punished by law. A debater inLucian declares, “Far better that a woman, in the madness of her lust, shouldusurp the nature of man, than that man’s noble nature should be so degraded asto play the woman.”25 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note25a] Similarly today, lesbianinterludes are a staple of heterosexual pornography. Ever since man emerged fromthe dominance of nature, masculinity has been the most fragile and problematicof psychic states.Greek culture has come to us mainly through Rome. Greek Apollonianism appealedto the highly ritualistic Romans, with their solemn formalism of religion, law,and politics. Rome returned Apollonianism to its Egyptian roots. Like Egypt,Rome was centered on a cult of the state; hierarchy and history were the meansof national identity. The Apollonian is always reactionary. For its ownpropaganda, Rome made Greek style monolithic. Gracious human scale yielded toofficialism, governmental overstatement. Kouros became colossus. Columns swelledand towered. Rome imitated not the plain, vigorous Doric pillar of the Parthenonnor the sleek, elegant Ionic pillar of the Erechtheum and Propylaea but thegigantic, frilly Corinthian pillar of the temple of Zeus on the plain below theAcropolis. Our cold white Federal architecture is Roman. Banks and governmentbuildings are vast temples of state, tombs and fortresses. No Greek temple lookslike a tomb. Rome rediscovered the hieratic Egyptian funeralism latent in GreekApollonian style. The Greeks were not interested in the dead. But Egypt and Romedefined themselves by death-rituals of preparation or commemoration. Romanancestors were eternal male presences. Their portraits, the imagines, first waxdeath masks and then stone busts, were kept in a household shrine and paraded atfunerals. Roman identity was condensed into discrete units of personalitycarried down the linear track of dynasty and history. Clan, tribalism, still sostrong in Italian culture, framed ethics and society. Sculptural westernpersonae began in Egypt but were given their definitive stamp by ApollonianRome. Rome made the roster of western selves, names engraved in stone.Rome inherited Greek style in the Hellenicization of the Mediterranean world inthe centuries before Christ. But the Roman mind was neither speculative noridealist. A Greek temple is solid, rare marble. A Roman temple is usually brickfaced with marble. Economy and practicality outweigh abstract aesthetics. Thepedimental Parthenon sculptures are finely carved front and back, even thoughtiny crimps of drapery would be hidden from the ground. But the back of a Romanstatue in a niche could be left relatively rough. Egyptian and GreekApollonianism was a metaphysic of the eye, an aristocratic aestheticism makingspiritual order of the visible and concrete. The Romans, except forHellenophiles like Hadrian, were not aesthetes. Rome took the eroticism anddreamy obliqueness out of Greek iconic sculpture. The great Prima Porta statueof Augustus, for example, is kouros turned suave, sober diplomat. Law and custombecame sacred ends in themselves. The Roman persona was a public construction:it had severity, weight, density. The Greeks were peripatetic, walking andtalking. Argument was mobile and improvisatory. But the Romans were declamatory,oratorical. They took stage and held it. The Roman persona was the stable prowof an ancient ship of state. Indeed, a “rostrum” is a ship’s prow, thetrophy-hung speaker’s platform of the Forum.Roman personality was equivalent to Greek epic, a repository of racial history.The group was paramount. The hero legends of early Rome, Marcus Curtius, MuciusScaevola, Horatius Cocles, Lucius Brutus, teach self sacrificed to state. TheRoman legion, much larger than the Greek phalanx, was an extrapolation of Rome’spolitical will: fortitude, resolution, victory. Rome began in combat against itsItalic neighbors and finally reduced the known world to servitude. Its growthwas a martial clash of identities, celebrated in the lavish triumph, anotherprocession mining the linearity of history. Roman art was documentary, whileGreek art treated contemporary history as allegory. Gisela Richter remarks: “Wehave not a single representation of the battles of Thermopylai or Salamis, ofthe Peloponnesian war, of the great plague, of the Sicilian expedition…. Howdifferent the Romans or the Egyptians and Assyrians with their endless friezesrecording their triumphs over their enemies.”26 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note26a]Roman art used facts to magnify reality; Greek art transformed reality byavoiding facts. Roman architecture was equally pragmatic, excelling in brilliantengineering, colossal public works like baths, aqueducts, and a far-flungnetwork of paved roads, so sturdy they are still in use. Greek Apollonianism wasa sublime projection, mind made radiant matter. But Roman Apollonianism was apower play, a proclamation of national grandeur. The hard Roman personaultimately descended from pharaonic self-conceptualization, the Old Kingdom’sfoursquare enthronements. State and self were monuments carved by Apollonianborderline.What of Apollo’s rival? Roman Bacchus is not Dionysus’ peer. He is merely arowdy wine god, a tippler and mirthmaker. Dionysus was so strong in Greecebecause of the dominance of Apollonian conceptualism. The combat between Apolloand Dionysus, never resolved, produced the rich diversity of Greek culture.Dionysus was unnecessary in Rome because of the ancient chthonianism of Italianreligion. Buying Greek prestige wholesale, the Romans identified their godswilly-nilly with the Olympians, an imperfect match-up in the case of roughDiana. The manes, the deified dead, occupied a sepulchral chthonian realm.Ancestor-worship is also ancestor-fear. Roman memoriousness was partcelebration, part propitiation. At the Parentalia in February, the family deadwere honored for a week. At the Lemuria in May, wandering ghosts were driven outof the family house. The dead pressed upon the dutiful consciousness of theliving.To this day, relatives in my mother’s village near Rome visit the cemetery everySunday to lay flowers on the graves. It is a kind of picnic. I rememberchildhood feelings of chill and awe at the candle kept burning by my grandmotherbefore a photograph of her dead daughter Lenora, the small, round yellow flameflickering in the darkened room. A sense of the mystic and uncanny has pervadedItalian culture for thousands of years, a pagan hieraticism flowering again inCatholicism, with its polychrome statues of martyred saints, its holy elbows andjawbones sealed in altarstones, and its mummified corpses on illuminateddisplay. In a chapel in Naples, I recently counted 112 gold and glass caskets ofmusty saints’ bones stacked as a transparent wall from floor to ceiling. Inanother church, I found a painting of the public disembowelling of a patientsaint, his intestines being methodically wound up on a large machine like apasta roller. Nailed like schools of fish to church walls are hundreds of tinysilver ears, noses, hearts, breasts, legs, feet, and other body parts, votiveofferings by parishioners seeking a cure. Old-style Italian Catholicism, nowshunned by middle-class WASP-aspiring descendants of immigrants, was full of thechthonian poetry of paganism. The Italian imagination is darkly archaic. Ithears the voices of the dead and identifies the passions and torments of thebody with the slumbering spirits of mother earth. A ritual fragment survivesfrom a southern Italian mystery-cult: “I have entered into the lap of the queenof the underworld.” I believe I understand this with every atavistic fiber of mybeing—its pagan conflation of longing, lust, fright, ecstasy, resignation, andrepose. It is the daemonic sublime.If there is an Apollonian-Dionysian dialectic in Rome, it is in the tensionbetween individual and group. This is the theme of the first four books ofVergil’s Aeneid, symbolized by red and gold. Carnal red is emotion, sex, life inthe body here and now. Imperial gold is the Roman future, harsh and glorious.Dutiful Aeneas must harden and limit himself. He carries ancestors and posterityon his back. Apollonian gold wins over Dionysian red, flaming up in Dido’sfuneral pyre. In Homer as in Vergil, woman is an obstacle to the heroic quest.The epic journey must free itself from female chains and delays. The Trojanwomen burn the ships, and Dido makes Aeneas her consort.Half of Aeneas’ destiny, says the opening of the poem, is to find the true wifeLavinia, his passage into Italian bloodlines. But Lavinia, no Penelope, shrinksas the poem goes on. Vergil oddly gives his imaginative sympathies to Amazonenemies of Rome. Carthage, founded by a Phoenician queen, is a transplant ofNear East autocracy and goddess cult. Woman is in mythic ascendancy. Venus,appearing as Diana to her son Aeneas, says her huntress’s quiver and high redboots are the Carthaginian female style. Aeneas inspects murals of the TrojanWar in the rising temple of savage Juno. When he comes to “Penthesilea furens,”Dido enters the poem. She is the Amazon of the first half of the Aeneid, just asCamilla is the Amazon of the second. Aeneas falls under her sway, and the malewill is stymied. He builds her city instead of his own.Venus armed is Aeneas’ lesson. Carthage is both the pleasure principle and theOrient from which he uproots himself. East yields to west, Asia to Europe. TheItalian tribes think Aeneas effeminate. Turnus calls him a “half-man”: “Let mefoul in the dust that hair crimped with curling-tongs and oiled with myrrh!”Dido’s suitor Iarbas calls him “this second Paris, wearing a Phrygian bonnet totie up his chin and cover his oily hair, and attended by a train of she-men.”27[ch25_notes.html#ch04note27a] Aeneas must purify his masculinity, creating thesimplicity and gravity of Roman personality. The Volscian warrior Camilla,apparently Vergil’s invention, is a new burst of female furor that must bequelled for Rome to be born. The Aeneid is remarkably attracted to theglamourous androgynes, Dido and Camilla, who steal the thunder of pallidLavinia. The poem follows its hero through a war of sexual personae. Femaledeviance, losing to decorous femininity, takes the poetry with it. The twinviragos win in defeat.Vergil writes at the borderline between republic and empire. In under a century,Rome accelerated in size and ambition. The new cosmopolitan sexual personaebroke with tradition. There was a shift from Apollonian unity and narrowness toDionysian pluralism, uncontrolled and eventually decadent. Granting universalcitizenship, Rome brought civilization to the world but diluted itself. Eighthundred years intervene between Homer and Vergil. When Vergil picks up the epicgenre, it no longer obeys poetic command. Epic plot, the male trajectory ofhistory, is the weakest thing in the Aeneid. Homer’s great rhetorical rhythmsare missing. The Iliad and Odyssey were all-day performance art, recited to liveaudiences by a professional bard of athletic stamina. The Aeneid is closetdrama. Vergil was melancholic, reclusive, possibly homosexual. His nicknameParthenias, “the maidenly man,” is a pun on Vergil/virgo and Parthenope, apoetic name for Naples, near which his villa was located.Vergil, unlike Homer, knew urban coteries of aristocratic refinement, a courtmilieu of febrile worldliness. This experience affects the Aeneid in unsuspectedways. Its sexual personae have undergone the same transformation as its epicgifts. Homer’s heroes exchange iron cauldrons and tripods, functional ware ofhigh Bronze Age value. Vergil’s gifts are objets d’art, gold and silver andstudded with jewels. Alexandrian museum consciousness has come into being.Vergil’s detachment and connoisseurship, so damaging to epic’s malepyrotechnics, intensify the erotic aura around persons and things. There is anintricate psychological meshing between poet and poem not present in Homer.Vergil is “involved” with Dido. Her obsession, suffering, and passion oflove-hate are the grandest things in literature since Euripides’ Medea. Vergil’sidentification with her is as palpable as Flaubert’s with Madame Bovary orTolstoy’s with Anna Karenina. The suicide of a male-willed heroine, in all threecases, may be a rite of exorcism, objectifying and terminating a male artist’sspiritual transsexualism. Falling on Aeneas’ sword, Dido cries, “Sic, sic iuvatire sub umbras” (“Thus, thus is it pleasing to go beneath the shades”). Theliquid Latin is thrillingly, hypnotically autoerotic, like honey and dark wine.The shadowy tongue tapping in our mouth is as private and phallic as thefetishistic sword.Little else in the Aeneid approaches the brilliance of the Carthaginian books.The poet probably knew it, as he ordered the unfinished poem burnt after hisdeath—like self-immolating Dido. Vergil is a decadent poet, a virtuoso ofdestruction. His fall of Troy is a cinematic apocalypse, flames filling thenight sky as violation and profanation swirl below. His characteristic imageryis sinuous, writhing, glistering, phosphorescent. The only translation thatcaptures the Aeneid’s uncanny daemonism is by W. F. Jackson Knight, in prose. Inthis poem, Roman ritualism falls to forces of the irrational, so long kept incheck. Vergil, an admirer of Augustus, shows the costs of political destiny—mostrecently, the suicide of another Oriental queen, Cleopatra, Dido’s model. Epicplot in the Aeneid is failed self-containment, a male scheme to bridletranssexual reverie. Vergil’s relation to his own poem is perverse. At ahistorical crisis in sexual personae, he turns to epic to stop it and stophimself. Spenser reproduces this conservative but deeply conflicted strategy inThe Faerie Queene. Sexual personae are vampires on plot in the Aeneid, aphenomenon I find in Coleridge’s Christabel and call psychoiconicism.The Roman republic made the persona, Greek theater’s wooden mask, a legalentity, sharp-contoured in the Apollonian way. The Roman decadence, ingenious inpleasures and cruelties, was a reaction against and satiric commentary on theausterity of republican personae, a profanation of ancestor cult. Republic toempire was like high classic to Hellenistic, unity to multiplicity. Romanreligion’s chthonian reverence turned into Dionysian orgy, now removed fromfertile nature. Maenadism was un-Roman. There was no Asiatic wildness in Romancult, with its priestly hierarchy, as in Egypt but not Greece. There wasprogram, formula, decorum, even in the honoring of omenfilled nature. The Romanpriest was an interpreter who kept his wits about him. He did not go into trancelike the Delphic oracle.True Greek orgy meant mystic loss of self. But in imperial Roman orgy, personacontinued. The Roman decadent kept the observing Apollonian eye awake duringDionysian revel. More Alexandrian connoisseurship, here applied to thefashionable self. Eye plus orgy equals decadence. Salaciousness, lewdness,lasciviousness: such interesting hyperstates are produced by a superimpositionof mind on erotic action. The west has pioneered in this charred crimsonterritory. Without strong personality of the western kind, serious decadence isimpossible. Sin is a form of cinema, seen from a distance. The Romans,pragmatically adapting Greek ideas, made engineering out of eroticism too. Theheir of Greek theater was not Roman theater but Roman sex. The Roman decadencehas never been matched in scale because other places and times have lacked thegreat mass of classical forms to corrupt. Rome made daemonic music of gluttonyand lust from the Dionysian body. The Maenadism absent from Roman cult becameimperial ecstasy, mechanized greed.Roman literature’s sexual personae are in hectic perpetual motion. Greekaristocratic athleticism split in two in Rome: vulgar gladiatorship by ruffiansand slaves, and leisure-class sexual adventurism, a sporting life then as now.As the republic ends, Catullus records the jazzy promiscuity of Rome’s chic set.Patrician women loitering on dark streets, giving themselves to commonpassers-by. Half-clad men molested by their mothers and sisters. Effeminatessoft as a rabbit and “languid as a limp penis.” A sodomite waking with batteredbuttocks and “red lips like snow,” mouth rimmed with last night’s pasty spoils.The strolling poet, finding a boy and girl copulating, falls upon the boy frombehind, piercing and driving him to his task. Public sex, it is fair to say, isdecadent. Oh, those happy pagan days, romping in green meadows: one stillencounters this sentimental notion, half-baked Keats. It is quite wrong.Catullus, like Baudelaire, savors imagery of squalor and filth. His moralassumptions remain those of republican Rome, which he jovially pollutes withdegeneration and disease. His poetry is a torch-lit descent into a gloomyunderworld, where we survey the contamination and collapse of Roman personae.Men and women are suddenly free, but freedom is a flood of superfluous energy, avicious circle of agitation, quest, satiation, exhaustion, ennui. Moral codesare always obstructive, relative, and man-made. Yet they have been of enormousprofit to civilization. They are civilization. Without them, we are invaded bythe chaotic barbarism of sex, nature’s tyranny, turning day into night and loveinto obsession and lust.Catullus, an admirer of Sappho, turns her emotional ambivalence intosadomasochism. Her chills and fever become his “odi et amo,” “I hate and Ilove.” Her beloved maidens, fresh as orange flowers, become his cynical Lesbia,adulteress and dominatrix, vampiristically “draining the strength of all.” Theurban femme fatale dons the primitive mask of mother nature. Lesbia, thewellborn Clodia, introduces to Rome a depraved sexual persona that had beencurrent, according to aggrieved comment of the Old Testament, for a thousandyears in Babylon. Female receptivity becomes a sinkhole of vice, the vagina acollector of pestilence to poison Roman nobility and bring it to an end.Catullus is a cartographer of sexual personae. His lament for the dying godAttis (Carmen 63) is an extraordinary improvisation on gender. Castratinghimself for Cybele, Attis enters a sexual twilight zone. Grammatically, the poemrefers to him as feminine. “I a woman, I a man, I a youth, I a boy”: in thislitany of haunting memory, Attis floats through a shamanistically expandedpresent tense of gender, all things and nothing. Like imperial Rome, he has beenpitched into an ecstatic free fall of personae. Suspension of sexual conventionsbrings melancholy, not joy. He is artistically detached from ordinary life butfeels “sterile.” Attis is the poet himself, mutating through gender in astrange, new, manic world.Ovid, born forty years later, is the first psychoanalyst of sex. His masterpieceis aptly called Metamorphoses: as Rome changes, Ovid plunders Greek and Romanlegend for magic transformations—man and god to animal and plant, male to femaleand back. Identity is liquid. Nature is under Dionysian spell; Apollo’s contoursdo not hold. The world becomes a projected psyche, played upon by amoralvagaries of sexual desire. Ovid’s encyclopedic attentiveness to eroticperversity will not recur until Spenser’s Faerie Queene, directly influenced byhim. His successors are Sade, Balzac, Proust, Krafft-Ebing, and Freud.The Metamorphoses is a handbook of sexual problematics. There is Iphis, a girlraised as a boy who falls in love with another girl and is relieved of hersuffering by being changed into a man. Or Caeneus, once the girl Caenis, whorejects marriage and is raped by Neptune. As compensation, she is changed into aman invulnerable to wounds, martial and sexual. According to the Homericscholiast, Caeneus set up his spear as a phallic totem in the marketplace,prayed and sacrificed to it, and commanded people hail it as a god, angeringZeus. In Vergil’s underworld, Aeneas sees Caeneus as a woman, the morphologicalghost of her femaleness reasserting itself. Ovid’s complications of violationand fetishism are theory, not titillation. The theme is our “double nature,” histerm for the centaurs who smother impenetrable Caeneus after a horrifying orgyof Maenadic pulverizations. Like Freud, Ovid constructs hypothetical models ofnarcissism and the will-to-power. His point of view comes from his positionbetween eras. Sexual personae, in flux, allow him to bring cool Apollonian studyto bear upon roiling Dionysian process.In his lesser works, Ovid lightens Catullus’ bitter sex war into parlorpolitics. In The Art of Love, he says the seducer must be shrewd and changeableas Proteus. This is the Roman Dionysus, metamorphic Greek nature reduced toerotic opportunism. Sex-change is a foxy game: the wise adulteress, counselsOvid, transsexualizes her letters, turning “he” to “she.” The empire divertedRoman conceptual energy into sex. So specialized is Martial’s sexual vocabularythat it influenced modern medical terminology. Latin, an exact but narrowlanguage, became startlingly precise about sexual activity. The Latinist FredNichols tells me that a verb in Martial, used in poetry for the first time byCatullus, describes the fluttering movement of the buttocks of the passivepartner in sodomy. There were, in fact, two forms of this verb: one for malesand another for females.Classical Athens, exalting masculine athleticism, had no conspicuous sexualsadomasochists and street transvestites. The Roman empire, on the other hand, ifwe believe the satirists, was overrun by epicene creatures. Ovid warns women tobeware of elegant men with coiffures “sleek with liquid nard”—they may be out tosteal your dress! “What can a woman do when her lover is smoother than she, andmay have more boyfriends?”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note28a] Ausonius tells asodomist with depilated anus and buttocks, “You are a woman behind, a man infront.” Girlish boys and long-haired male prostitutes appear in Horace,Petronius, and Martial. Gaius Julius Phaedrus blames homosexuals of both sexeson drunken Prometheus, who attached the wrong genitalia to human figures he wasmolding. Lesbianism, infrequent in Greek literature, makes a splash in Rome.Martial and Horace record real-life tribads, Balba, Philaenis, and Folia ofArminum, with her “masculine libidinousness.” There are lesbian innuendos aboutthe all-woman rites of the Bona Dea, crashed by Publius Clodius in drag.Lucian’s debater condemns lesbian acts as “androgynous passions” and callsdildos “infamous instruments of lust, an unholy imitation of a fruitlessunion.”29 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note29a] Rome’s sexual disorientation was greattheater, but it led to the collapse of paganism.Pursuit of pleasure belongs on the party circuit, not in the centers of power.Today too, one might like playfulness and spontaneity in a friend, lover, orstar, but one wants a different character in people with professional orpolitical authority. The more regular, unimaginative, and boring the daily livesof presidents, surgeons, and airline pilots, the better for us, thank you verymuch. Hierarchic ministry should be ascetic and focused. It does not profit fromidentity crises, the province of art. Rome had a genius for organization. Itsadministrative structure was absorbed by the Catholic Church, which turned anesoteric Palestinian sect into a world religion. Roman imperial bureaucracy, anextension of republican legalism, was a superb machine, rolling over othernations with brutal force. Two thousand years later, we are still feeling theconsequences of its destruction of Judaea and dispersion of the fractious Jews,who refused to become Roman. We know from Hollywood movies what that machinesounded like, its thunderous, relentless marching drums pushing Roman destinyacross the world and through history. But when the masters of the machine turnedto idleness and frivolity, Roman moral force vanished.The Roman annalists give us the riveting gossip. Sodomy was reported of theemperors Tiberius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Commodus, Trajan, and Elagabalus. EvenJulius Caesar was rumored to be bisexual. Hadrian fell in love with thebeautiful Antinous, deified him after his death, and spread his imageeverywhere. Caligula had a taste for extravagant robes and women’s clothes. Hedressed his wife Caesonia in armour and paraded her before the troops. He lovedimpersonations, appearing in wig and costume as singer, dancer, charioteer,gladiator, virgin huntress, wife. He posed as all the male and female gods. AsJupiter, he seduced many women, including his sisters. Cassius Dio tartlyremarks, “He was eager to appear to be anything rather than a human being and anemperor.”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note30a]Nero chose the roles of bard, athlete, and charioteer. He dressed as a tragedianto watch Rome burn. Onstage he played heroes and heroines, gods and goddesses.He pretended to be a runaway slave, a blind man, a madman, a pregnant woman, awoman in labor. He wore the mask of his wife Poppaea Sabina, who had died, itwas said, after he kicked her in her pregnant belly. Nero was a clever architectof sexual spectacle. He built riverbank brothels and installed patrician womento solicit him from doorways. Tying young male and female victims to stakes, hedraped himself in animal skins and leapt out from a den to attack theirgenitals. Nero devised two homosexual parodies of marriage. He castrated the boySporus, who resembled dead Poppaea, dressed him in women’s clothes, and marriedhim before the court, treating him afterward as wife and empress. In the secondmale marriage, with a youth whom Tacitus calls Pythagoras and SuetoniusDoryphorus, sex roles were reversed: the emperor was bride. “On the weddingnight,” reports Suetonius, “he imitated the screams and moans of a girl beingdeflowered.”31 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note31a]Commodus gave his mother’s name to a concubine, making his sex life an Oedipaldrama. He appeared as Mercury and transvestite Hercules. He was calledAmazonius, because he dressed his concubine Marcia as an Amazon and wanted toappear as an Amazon himself in the arena. Elagabalus, Caracalla’s cousin,brought the sexually freakish customs of Asia Minor to imperial Rome. Hescandalized the army with his silks, jewelry, and dancing. His short reign wasgiddy with plays, pageants, and parlor games. Lampridius says, “He got himselfup as a confectioner, a perfumer, a cook, a shopkeeper, or a procurer, and heeven practiced all these occupations in his own house continually.”32[ch25_notes.html#ch04note32a] Elagabalus’ lordly ease of access to plebeianroles was social mobility in reverse. Like Nero, he practiced “classtransvestism,” David Reisman’s phrase for the modern bluejeans fad.33[ch25_notes.html#ch04note33a]Elagabalus’ life passion was his longing for womanhood. Wearing a wig, heprostituted himself in real Roman brothels. Cassius Dio reports:He set aside a room in the palace and there committed his indecencies, alwaysstanding nude at the door of the room, as the harlots do, and shaking thecurtain which hung from gold rings, while in a soft and melting voice hesolicited the passers-by. There were, of course, men who had been speciallyinstructed to play their part…. He would collect money from his patrons and givehimself airs over his gains; he would also dispute with his associates in thisshameful occupation, claiming that he had more lovers than they and took in moremoney.Miming an adulteress caught in the act and beaten by her husband, the emperorcherished black eyes as a souvenir. He summoned to court a man notorious forenormous genitals and greeted him with “a ravishing feminine pose,” saying,“Call me not Lord, for I am a Lady.” He impersonated the Great Mother in alion-drawn chariot and publicly posed as the Venus Pudica, dropping to his kneeswith buttocks thrust before a male partner. Finally, Elagabalus’ transvestitefantasies led to a desire to change sex. He had to be dissuaded from castratinghimself, reluctantly accepting circumcision as a compromise. Dio says, “He askedthe physicians to contrive a woman’s vagina in his body by means of an incision,promising them large sums for doing so.”34 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note34a]Science, which only recently perfected this operation, is clearly laggard uponthe sexual imagination.Absolute power is a door into dreaming. The Roman emperors made living theaterof their turbulent world. There was no gap between wish and realization; fantasyleapt into instant visibility. Roman imperial masque: charades, inquisition,horseplay. The emperors made sexual personae an artistic medium, plastic asclay. Nero, setting live Christians afire for a night banquet, played withreality. Roman copies of Greek statues are a bit dull and coarse. So too withRome’s sexual literalization of Greek drama. The emperors, acting to provoke,torture, or arouse, removed the poetry and philosophy from theater. Thevomitoria of Roman villas are troughs for vomiting the last six courses beforestarting on the next. Vomitoria is also the name for the exits of Romanamphitheaters, through which the mob poured. Imperial Rome, heir to sprawlingHellenistic culture, suffered from too-muchness, the hallmark of decadence. Toomuch mind, too much body; too many people, too many facts. The mind of the kingis a perverse mirror of the time. Having no cinema, Nero made his own. InAthens, the beautiful boy was an idealized objet de cuite. In Rome, persons werestage machinery, mannequins, décor. The lives of the wastrel emperorsdemonstrate the inadequacy of our modern myth of personal freedom. Here were menwho were free and who were sickened by that freedom. Sexual liberation, ourdeceitful mirage, ends in lassitude and inertness. An emperor’s day wasandrogyny-in-action. But was he happier than his republican ancestors, withtheir rigid sex roles? Repression makes meaning and purpose.The more moral an emperor, the less he was drawn to theater. Dio says ofTrajan’s empress: “When Plotina, his wife, first entered the palace, she turnedround so as to face the stairway and the populace and said: ‘I enter here such aperson as I wish to be when I depart.’ And she conducted herself during theentire reign in such manner as to incur no censure.”35[ch25_notes.html#ch04note35a] With old Roman integrity, Plotina rejects randommetamorphosis of personality. The moral man has one persona, firmly fixed in thegreat chain of being. Plato dismisses myths about the gods changing shape: “Isnot the best always least liable to change or alteration by an external cause? …Every god is as perfect and as good as possible, and remains in his own formwithout variation for ever.”36 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note36a] Virtue and divinityare unitary, homogeneous, Apollonian. Thus the empress Plotina resists theself-division of worldly experience. Multiplicity of persona is anarchic. Hermesis a thief. Hence the neoclassic eighteenth century, unlike the Renaissance,rejects the androgyne: Pope assails epicene Lord Hervey, whom he casts as Nero’scatamite Sporus, for defying the great chain of being. Sporus refuses to confinehimself to one social or sexual role, transgressing the borders of male andfemale, mammal and reptile, even animal and mineral.37[ch25_notes.html#ch04note37a] For Pope, a man knows his own place and his ownface. There are no masks.Theatrical self-transformation, a seductive principle of our time, can never bereconciled with morality. From antiquity on, professional theater has been undera moral cloud. Autocrat, artist, actor: freedom of persona is magical butdestabilizing. An emperor’s appearance onstage was shocking, since actors weredéclassé, barred from Roman citizenship. St. Augustine denounces “the voluptuousmadness of stage-plays” and “the foul plague-spot” of the theater.38[ch25_notes.html#ch04note38a] Tertullian complains of theater’s immorality andits frequenting by prostitutes, who even took to the stage to advertisethemselves. The first English actresses, in the late seventeenth century, werenotorious for promiscuity. In 1969, the New York Social Register still droppedthe name of a man who married a movie star. The Puritans, who managed to closethe theaters for eighteen years, equated fiction with deceit. They were right.Art remains an avenue of escape from morality. Actors live in illusion; they areskittish shamans, drenched in being. Crafty fabricators of mood and gesture,they slip along the edges of convention. Actor and artist are the first toregister historical change. They write the sibylline leaves of western sexualpersonae.Roman decadence was the final skirmish between the Apollonian and Dionysianelements in pagan culture. The strength and vigor of the Roman republic camefrom its synthesis of an Apollonian cult of the state with archaic chthonianritualism. Major early Roman gods were male, with subordinate fertilitygoddesses. Although worship of the Great Mother had been introduced in 204 B.C.and had always been an option of the aristocracy, her popularity during theempire was a significant departure from Rome’s first principles. She came fromthe eastern Mediterranean, where nature is less hospitable and more absolute.Was this turn toward female divinity a cultural advance or retreat? Then andnow, worship of the Great Mother in an urban era is decadent. Imperial Romans nolonger lived in and by the cycle of nature. The Great Mother went from fertilelife force to sadomasochistic sexual persona. She was the ultimate dominatrix.In late Rome, men were passive to history. Decadence is the juxtaposition ofprimitivism with sophistication, a circling back of history on itself. The RomanGreat Mother, with her multiple names and symbols, was heavy with the past. Herpregnancy was curatorial, another Alexandrian museum.The Great Mother was the focus of new anxieties and spiritual longings thatwould not be satisfied until the consolidation of Christianity. The ChurchFathers recognized the Great Mother as the enemy of Christ. St. Augustine,writing at a turning point in western culture (ca. 415 A.D.), calls the rites ofCybele “obscene,” “shameful,” “filthy,” “the mad and abominable revelry ofeffeminates and mutilated men”: “If these are sacred rites, what is sacrilege?If this is purification, what is pollution? … The Great Mother has surpassed allher sons, not in greatness of deity, but of crime.” Cybele is a “monster,”imposing a “deformity of cruelty” on her castrated priests. Even Jupiter sinnedless: “He, with all his seductions of women, only disgraced heaven with oneGanymede; she, with so many avowed and public effeminates, has both defiled theearth and outraged heaven.”39 [ch25_notes.html#ch04note39a] The Great Mother,like Rome herself, is the Whore of Babylon.Christianity could not tolerate the pagan integration of sex, cruelty, anddivinity. It thrust chthonian nature into the nether realm, to be infested bymedieval witches. Daemonism became demonism, a conspiracy against God. Love,tenderness, pity became the new virtues, soft qualities of the Palestinianmartyr. The pagan veneration of force had turned politics into a bloodbath. LateRome oscillated between fatigue and brutality. Flagellation and castration inthe mother-cults was a sacrificial symbol of human dependency on nature. In theempire, however, whipping got kinky, and castrates went professional. Packs ofthem, in wigs, makeup, and garish female dress, roamed the towns and highwaysclinking cymbals and begging for alms. Apuleius describes them “squeaking fordelight in their splintering harsh womanish voices.”40[ch25_notes.html#ch04note40a] Eunuchs had a high profile in the empire. Churchleaders despised them. Christian strictness about sex roles dates from thisperiod of crass, flamboyant personae. The Great Mother’s castrate devotees,turning ritual orgy into street carnival, put the effeminate or homosexual maleinto permanent ill repute. When woman resurfaces in the Christian pantheon, shewill be the mild Virgin without animal taint. Banished by Augustine, the GreatMother disappears for over a thousand years. But she returns in all her glory inRomanticism, that historical wave of the archetypal.Though it destroyed the outward forms of paganism, Christianity has neverinterrupted the pagan continuity of sexual personae, latent in our language,ideas, and images. Christianity inherited Judaism’s suspicion of image-making,but in its centuries of expansion, it began to use pictures as a didactic tool.The earliest Christians were an illiterate underclass. Christian pictures werefirst rudimentary scrawls, a new cave art in Roman catacombs; then they sailedupward into Byzantine domes, where they copied Greek iconic posture andhard-edged Apollonian style. Christian saints are reborn pagan personae. MartinLuther correctly diagnosed a loss of aboriginal Christianity in the ItalianChurch. The Romanism in Catholicism is splendidly, enduringly pagan, spillingout in Renaissance, Counter-Reformation, and beyond.Paganism is pictorialism plus the will-to-power. It is ritualism, grandiosity,colossalism, sensationalism. All theater is pagan showiness, the brazen pomp ofsexual personae. Judaism’s campaign to make divinity invisible has never fullysucceeded. Images are always eluding moral control, creating the brilliantwestern art tradition. Idolatry is fascism of the eye. The western eye will beserved, with or without the consent of conscience. Images are archaicprojection, earlier than words and morals. Greco-Roman personality is itself avisual image, shapely and concrete. The sexual and psychological deficiencies ofJudeo-Christianity have become blatant in our own time. Popular culture is thenew Babylon, into which so much art and intellect now flow. It is our imperialsex theater, supreme temple of the western eye. We live in the age of idols. Thepagan past, never dead, flames again in our mystic hierarchies of stardom."},{"pageContent":"5RENAISSANCE FORMItalian ArtThe Renaissance, a rebirth of pagan image and form, was an explosion of sexualpersonae. Recent scholarship has followed a Christianizing tendency, smoothingthe rough edges off the Renaissance and giving it an anachronistic moral tone.Specialists have slowly redefined Renaissance humanism in their own image,patient and prudent. Yet the disciples of saintly Raphael could plot the murderof a rival artist in the street. The sudden intellectual and geographicalexpansion of culture inaugurated three centuries of psychological turbulence.Renaissance style was spectacle and display, a pagan ostentation. TheRenaissance liberated the western eye, repressed by the Christian Middle Ages.In that eye, sex and aggression are amorally fused.The great chain of being, a master principle of western culture from classicalantiquity to the Enlightenment, sees the universe as hierarchical: mineral,plant, animal, man, angel, God. The Renaissance was politically unstable.Shakespeare’s Ulysses grounds politics in the great chain of being: disrespectfor authority is like misaligned planets causing earthquake and storm (Troilusand Cressida I.iii.83–126). From the tension between sexual personae and publicorder came an abundance of Renaissance literature and art. Celebrations of thebeauty and necessity of order are a reflex of the nearness of disorder.The medieval great chain of being suffered a climactic trauma: the Black Deathof 1348, a bubonic plague that killed up to 40 percent of Europe’s population.Boccaccio decribes the breakdown of law and government, the desertion of childby parent and husband by wife. A wellborn woman who fell ill was nursed by amale servant: “Nor did she have any scruples about showing him every part of herbody as freely as she would have displayed it to a woman …; and this explainswhy those women who recovered were possibly less chaste in the period thatfollowed.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note1a] The Black Death weakened socialcontrols. It had a polar effect, pushing some toward debauchery and others, likethe flagellants, toward religiosity.The Athenian plague, I argued, brought high classicism to an end. The BlackDeath worked in reverse, giving birth to the Renaissance by destroying theMiddle Ages. Philip Ziegler says, “Modern man was forged in the crucible of theBlack Death.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note2a] Christianity’s failure to protectthe good damaged Church authority and opened the way for the Reformation. Ithink the grossness and squalor of plague broke the Christian taboo on displayof the body. Pagan nudity reappeared in its anguished Hellenistic form oftorture, massacre, and decay. By reducing persons to bodies, the plague putpersonality into a purely physical or secular dimension. I begin Renaissance artwith the shock of the Black Death. Public ugliness and exhibitionism unmoralizedthe body and prepared it for its reidealization in painting and sculpture.Boccaccio’s plague-framed Decameron, the first work of Renaissance literature,is an epic of cultural disintegration and renewal.At the Renaissance, says Jacob Burckhardt, there was an “awakening ofpersonality.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note3a] Renaissance art teems withpersonalities, arrogant, seductive, vivacious. Italy restores the pagantheatricality of western identity. There is a craze for cosmetics, hairstyles,costumes. What would have been vanity and sybaritism in the Middle Ages becomesthe public language of personae. Architecture takes vivid hue. The white marbleof the Florentine Duomo (completed in the early Renaissance) is crossed with redand green, hallucinatory vibrations in the Italian sun. This burst of multiplecolor is like coming to Vergil after Caesar and Cicero. The Aeneid’s newartistic palette—rose, violet, purple—signals the manic proliferation ofimperial personae. So too in the Renaissance, as in the psychedelic Sixties.Colors and personae are in dynamic relation. By the late Renaissance,architecture dissolves in color or is buried under ornamentation. Bernini usestwenty colored marbles for the Cornaro Chapel. In that outbreak of pagan sex andviolence which is the Bernini Baroque, the liberated eye finally drifts into asea of sensual excitation.The Renaissance infatuation with sexual personae is reflected in Castiglione’sBook of the Courtier (1528), which had enormous influence all over Europe. It isa program for theatricality. The man with a talent, says Castiglione, should“adroitly seek the occasion for displaying it.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note4a]Social life is a stage and each man a dramatist. Castiglione set high standardsof taste for dress and deportment. The courtier is an artifact, a work ofself-sculpture. He is also an androgyne: he has “a special sweetness,” a “grace”and “beauty.” Two of his primary qualities, sprezzatura and disinvoltura(“nonchalance” and “ease”), are hermaphroditizing. That is, by making speech andmovement seem effortless, they disguise or efface masculine action. Woman iscentral to the Book of the Courtier: the dialogue takes place in the apartmentsof the Duchess of Mantua while the Duke sleeps, and woman literally has the lastword. The Castiglione woman is purely feminine. Castiglione opposes thedouble-sexed Petrarchan model of womanhood, with its proud, killing cold. Thecourtier’s sweetness and grace seep into him from contact with women. Maleeducation is Castiglione’s theme as much as Plato’s, but woman has now capturedthe symbolic high ground of spiritual value. In Castiglione, all women areDiotimas.The courtier quests for a sexual persona perfectly balancing masculine andfeminine. Castiglione warns against effeminancy, excessive feminization. Thecourtier’s face should have “something manly about it”:I would have our Courtier’s face be such, not so soft and feminine as manyattempt to have who not only curl their hair and pluck their eyebrows, but preenthemselves in all those ways that the most wanton and dissolute women in theworld adopt; and in walking, in posture, and in every act, appear so tender andlanguid that their limbs seem to be on the verge of falling apart; and uttertheir words so limply that it seems they are about to expire on the spot; andthe more they find themselves in the company of men of rank, the more they makea show of such manners. These, since nature did not make them women as theyclearly wish to appear and be, should be treated not as good women, but aspublic harlots, and driven not only from the courts of great lords but from thesociety of all noble men.5 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note5a]Is this merely an attack on open homosexuality? Castiglione implies thateffeminacy is somehow inspired by the presence of authority figures. The issueis the moral welfare of court and sovereign.We come now to history’s most repellent androgyne, completely overlooked byfeminist promoters of androgyny. I call it the “court hermaphrodite.”Renaissance high culture was organized around the courts of duke and king, uponwhom artists and intellectuals depended for patronage. Art was a tool ofcompetitive display, by which a ruler maintained his prestige. Power alwaysgenerates sycophancy. Enid Welsford says, “The blasphemous flattering ofprinces, which was such a disagreeable characteristic of Renaissance literatureand revelling, was not a mere fashion of speech but a sign that the state wasbeing regarded as an end in itself.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note6a] A prince, onestep from God, reproduced the great chain of being in his court hierarchy.Flattery was secular prayer, worship of the sacred order. But the insincereflatterer was leech and opportunist, a polluter of language. In Castiglione’sdetestation of the type, we see the moral dangers of Renaissance theatricality.The court hermaphrodite appears wherever there is wealth, power, and fame. He isin governments, corporations, university departments, and the book and artworld. We know the professional sycophant from the Hollywood flack or yes-man.He is the celebrity hairdresser, the boudoir confidant and lounge lizard, theglossy escort. Ava Gardner said of an unctuous gossip columnist, “He’s either atyour feet or at your throat.” Flattery and malice come from the same forkedtongue. The sycophant is an androgyne because of his pliability and servility.He is a deformation of Castiglione’s courtier: self-sculpture becomes slavishplasticity to the ruler’s whim and will. Identity is self-evacuated. Theflatterer opens himself like a glove to the royal hand. Castiglione’s male“harlots” are, or seem to be, homosexual because sycophancy is political sodomy.We call a flatterer a brown-nose, an ass-licker, sucking up, grovelling, supine.His shameless self-abasement is unmanly, elevating bum over head. Lloyd Georgesaid Lord Derby was “a cushion who always bore the impress of the last man whosat on him.” Like Milton’s “fawning” Satan, the smooth flatterer crawls on hisbelly, twisting and turning with changing circumstance. He is purely reactive, aparody of femininity, each word and deed a cloying mime of the ruler’s desire.This phenomenon may be a perversion of male bonding, a social spectacle ofdominance and submission.Shakespeare’s Richard II is rebuked by his lords for the “thousand flatterers”who sway his judgment (II.i.100). Flattery poisoning the court world of Hamletis one cause of the hero’s chronic nausea. Polonius and the young courtier Osricagree like annoying echoes with each of the exasperated Hamlet’s nonsensicalassertions. The court hermaphrodite has no gender because he has no real self ormoral substance. Most painful to Hamlet is the betrayal of his childhoodfriends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who turn spy for the king. Hamlet callsRosencrantz a “sponge … that soaks up the king’s countenance, his rewards, hisauthorities” (IV.ii.12–21). Goethe’s Wilheim Meister rejects a proposal tocombine the two men into one: there ought to be “at least a dozen” of them, for“they are society itself.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note7a] Shakespeare’s dramaticdoubling of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern is the court hermaphrodite sterilelycloning itself. Inseparable and indistinguishable, they hover in floatingpassivity. Pope’s ambitious dunces dive into London sewage: sycophancy was afoul byproduct of Renaissance secularism. John Donne alludes to “paintedcourtiers” and “strange Hermaphrodits” (Epithalamion made at Lincolnes Inne). InBen Jonson’s Volpone, the “parasite” Mosca is cunning household sycophant to anobleman whose entourage includes a eunuch, Castrone, and a hermaphrodite,Androgyno. Pleased with Mosca’s services, Volpone cries, “My witty mischief, /Let me embrace thee. O that I could now / Transform thee to a Venus!” (V.i.)Flattery is sexual subordination. Hierarchy is conceptualized eroticism, whichis why, as homely Henry Kissinger said, power is the ultimate aphrodisiac. TheRenaissance court aesthetic is still thriving in the eighteenth century, whenPope denounces Lord Hervey as a cynical court hermaphrodite and Mirabeau callsMarie Antoinette “the only man at court.” Two cinema court hermaphrodites areKatharine Hepburn’s nervy, epicene secretary Gerald in Woman of the Year and theodious eunuch Photinus, Pharaoh’s lord chamberlain in the Elizabeth TaylorCleopatra.Renaissance hierarchies are dramatized in the noisy climax of BenvenutoCellini’s Autobiography (1562). The artist is one of the great sexual personaeof the Renaissance, a culture hero and worker of marvels. Before this, sculptorand painter, as manual laborers, were always inferior to the poet. Everywhereexcept Greece, they were simply artisans, like today’s carpenter and plumber.Cellini’s bronze Perseus is forged in a Wagnerian storm of western will. Theartist attacks by earth, air, water, and fire. He piles on wood, brick, iron,copper; he digs a pit; he hauls ropes. He shapes his hero out of clay and wax.He exerts superhuman energies, until he is struck down by fever. Cellini takesto bed in ritual couvade, while Perseus strains to be born. The metal curdlesand must be resurrected from the dead. Finally, the shouting, cursing artist,transfigured by creative ecstasy, defeats all obstacles and brings Perseus intothe world in an explosion, “a tremendous flash of flame” like a thunderbolt.Cellini has made “miracles,” triumphing by a godlike blend of male and femalepower.8 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note8a]Now Perseus is placed in Florence’s public square (fig. 18[ch05.html#ch05fig18]). At its unveiling, the crowd sends up “a shout ofboundless enthusiasm.” Dozens of sonnets are nailed up, panegyrics by universityscholars. The Duke sits for hours hidden in a palace window, listening tocitizens acclaim the statue. This thrilling episode demonstrates the potentialfor collectivity at certain privileged moments in history. The Renaissance madepublic art, uniting the social classes in a common emotion. A figure on aplatform; the mingling of nobles, intellectuals, plebeians: one thinks of thebroad audience of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre. It is impossible to imagine amodern art work provoking a shout from a socially mixed crowd. Our soleequivalent is cinema, as at the Atlanta premiere of Gone with the Wind. Celliniillustrates the national differences in Renaissance form: in Italy, the objetd’art; in England, drama.Image [../images/f0145-01.jpg]18. Benvenuto Cellini, Perseus with the Head of Medusa, ca. 1550.Whether Cellini lies or exaggerates is irrelevant. His autobiography (dictatedto a scribe) is compulsively western in its hierarchical vision. Little in theEast corresponds to this epiphanic theatricality of the art object, thisconcentration of affect upon a single point, the apex of a perceptual pyramid.The Perseus is an Apollonian idol of the aggressive western eye. It is partlyCellini’s victorious superself and partly a homoerotic glamourization of thebeautiful boy, a Greco-Roman theme revived in the Renaissance. Westernpersonality is raised on a pedestal, in Florence or in Nuremberg. LeniRiefenstahl did for Hitler what the neoclassic David did for Napoleon.Personality is ritualized by the fascism of the western eye. Cellini, by divineforce of genius, raises his Perseus to a summit presided over by an invisiblegodlike Duke. Agon and revelation: western religion, art, and politics use thesame dramaturgy of form, because they are all emanations of cold hierarchicalmind.Perseus was Cellini’s answer to the heroic marble David made by Michelangeloforty years earlier for the same public square. Both statues descend fromDonatello’s bronze David, the first beautiful nude and the first trulyfree-standing sculpture since the fall of Rome. Blatantly homosexual ininspiration, it shows David standing victorious over the severed head ofGoliath, which he tramples underfoot (fig. 19 [ch05.html#ch05fig19]). The storyof David and Goliath, like that of Judith and Holofernes, would become apolitical symbol of Florentine resistance to tyranny. Donatello’s David isastonishingly young, even younger than the Kritios Boy. David’s contrapposto islanguorously Hellenistic. The hand on hip and cocked knee create an air ofsexual solicitation. From the side, one is struck by the peachy buttocks, bonyshoulderblades, and petulantly protruding boy-belly. The combination of child’sphysique with female body language is perverse and pederastic. Michelangelo isto adopt this erotic formula for his more athletic nudes, where it becomesovertly sadomasochistic.For H. W. Janson, Donatello’s David is “strangely androgynous,” “le beau garçonsans merci, conscious only of his own sensuous beauty.” There may be aconnection to Beccadelli’s poetry collection, Hermaphroditus.9[ch25_notes.html#ch05note9a] David has long feminine locks of hair, tangled withribbons, and a splendidly raffish wreathed hat, a version of the traveller’s hatof Hermes Psychopompos. But here is no traveller’s cloak, only exquisitelyetched leather buskins. A pornographic trope: the half-dressed is more eroticthan the totally nude. The feathery wing of Goliath’s helmet, like an escapingthought, climbs ticklishly up the inside of David’s thigh, pointing toward thegenitals. Roman putti often display their genitals or mischievously urinate, amotif adopted for Renaissance fountains. Donatello poeticizes the ostentatiogenitalium, a pagan showing. The hoary head of a monster conquered is a familiariconographic detail, but here it vomits a wreathlike flood of blood ringing thestatue. The stream is the giant’s, and the artist’s, own desire. David, plunginghis massive sword to the center, has stolen the adult penis, as he has stolenhearts. The gushing blood, wing-topped, is a carnal cloud, Zeus as a maimedeagle bearing up Ganymede.Image [../images/f0147-01.jpg]19. Donatello, David, ca. 1430–32.I think Donatello’s David, even more than the ancient Venus Pudica, was the truemodel for Botticelli’s Venus. David, fusing Venus and Mars, skims into view on aswirl of the dreaming artist’s fantasy, half spasmodic release, half risingsigh. The David’s shimmery, slithery bronze is a frozen wet dream, an Apollonianpetrifaction. It is also a portrait of the artist, whose oppressed face appearslike a signature at the bottom, another homoerotic motif borrowed byMichelangelo. The armed boy bursts like Athena from the artist’s imprisonedbrain.The glamourous Apollonianism of Italian Renaissance art begins with Donatello,who frees sculpture from its medieval subordination to architecture. From hisSt. George (1417), stepping from its niche, to David: stone knight to bronzekouros. Medieval armour is the pagan exoskeleton of western personality. Hard,shiny, absolutist, it is a product of that radiant Apollonian thing-making whichpasses from Egypt to Greece and Rome and resurfaces in the High Middle Ages asmilitary design. The bronze David is St. George’s suit of armour turned insideout. David’s brazen nudity is the impermeability of western personality. Hiscompact frame is supercondensed by the aggressive western eye. He is personalityas sex and power.The beautiful boy is homosexuality’s greatest contribution to western culture.Un-Christian and anti-Christian, he is an iconic formalization of the relationbetween the eye and reality. Repeated in a thousand forms in Italian paintingand sculpture, he is the ultimate symbol of Renaissance art. He is St.Sebastian, the Christian Adonis pierced by arrows, or ephebic St. Michael, whomthe Renaissance took out of his Byzantine tunic and clad in silver armour. TheNorthern European Renaissance has few beautiful boys and no Apollonian grandeur.Figures (portraits excepted) rarely fill the pictorial plane. They are modest,fluttery, and to my Mediterranean eye dry and insipid. They allow space to pressupon them. Italian art makes personality and gesture florid and theatrical, inthe fascist Apollonian manner. Donatello’s David stands on its own because ithas rejected northern Gothicism for southern paganism. Its hardness anddomination of space come from the artist’s rediscovery of the authenticallywestern will, inflexible and amoral. Art has rearmed itself with the paganglorification of matter.Donatello’s youths are always sexually ambiguous. His marble, clothed David(1409) has a graceful, feminine hand and girlishly delicate face with a small,pretty mouth. The statue was apparently based on an Etruscan goddess in theMedici collection.10 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note10a] The unfinished marble Davidin Washington has fleshy cheeks in classic Greek style. The bust of a youth inFlorence has a sensitive face and sweet smile and a provocatively swellingthroat and breast. With longer hair, he could pass as a woman. In his harrowinglate period, Donatello abandons his ephebic dreams and banishes pagan eroticismfrom his art. The emaciated wooden John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene arewithered by guilt and atonement. David’s glossy Apollonian surface is scored andslashed, the flesh already bored by worms. Such self-laceration is typical ofMediterranean Catholicism, with the ecstatic mortifications of its paganheritage.The morally and sexually ambiguous smile of Donatello’s David has a longsubsequent history. It goes directly to Michelangelo’s Victory after passingthrough Verrocchio to Leonardo, where it ends up on the Mona Lisa. Finally, wesee it on Bernini’s androgynous angel impishly piercing St. Teresa. David’ssmile is dreamy and solipsistic. He is the beautiful boy as destroyer,triumphing over his admirers. He is western armoured ego as sex object,free-standing because separatist. Despite his beguiling insouciance, David’sApollonian hardness, mental and material, is evident when we compare him toCaravaggio’s beautiful boys. Here, by the richness of oil paint, the Dionysianmouth intrudes on the Apollonian eye. Caravaggio’s cardinal metaphor of fruit iswritten all over his street urchins’ inviting nudity. Subtly, despite ourselves,we salivate. In high classic dignity, Donatello’s David, unlike Caravaggio’sbolder boys, does not meet our eyes. His sword keeps us at a distance. He hastrue Apollonian iconicism. While entranced by his eroticism, we look up to himand leave him in his temenos of sacred beauty. Like Nefertiti, he is a hierarchof the western eye.In my history of sexual personae, Botticelli is Donatello’s heir. I seeDonatello’s androgynous David in every face in Botticelli. It is the sameelaboration of a single face into a whole universe of sexual ambiguity and mutedcolor tones that happens from Rossetti to Burne-Jones. Botticelli turns Gothic’swavy slimness and height into sophisticated Apollonian linearity. He shares withPollaiuolo and Mantegna the sharp Byzantine outline that, thanks to Donatello,survived Masaccio’s new shadowed contours. Pollaiuolo’s anatomies are busy andstrained, but Botticelli’s, in his best work, have a high classic unity andrepose. Even in the segmented Primavera, personality is in the foreground,literally and figuratively. Botticelli thinks in terms of sexual personae,swelling with innate authority. I spoke of the descent of Byzantine icons, withtheir sharp edges and static frontality, from the Greek kouros. Botticelliresurrects the paganism in the Byzantine line. Inspired by Donatello’sfree-standing David, he restores Apollonian iconicism to the painted figure.Botticelli’s clarity of outline is the same armouring of western personality wefirst saw in the enthroned Pharaoh Chephren. The hardness of the Botticellianbody is, I venture, a subliminally homosexual motif, like the closing off offemale internality in Greek sculpture. It will become the Panzerhaft or glazedarmouring of Mannerist figures in Pontormo and Bronzino. By deduction,therefore, Mannerist hardness is the ultimate result of Donatello’s momentousstep from marble to bronze, from stone armour to armed nudity.In The Birth of Venus, Botticelli reimagines a chthonian goddess as Apollonianpersonality (fig. 20 [ch05.html#ch05fig20]). She scuds to shore on a metallicscallop shell, the heraldic shield of woman’s marine origins. On her face is thepensive smile of Donatello’s dreamy David, and around her winds, as a heavy ropeof strawberry-blonde hair, the ruddy wish-stream of Donatello’s bleedingGoliath. The Birth of Venus, thirteen feet wide, is a pagan altarpiece. Thegoddess’s monumentality and proud separatism come from sculpture. In this culticepiphany, Venus dominates the eye, as she dominates the picture plane. She risesfrom the starburst shell (a trumpeting petrifaction of her splashing foam) tostand in Apollonian sunlight. She is sex and love washed clean of mystery anddanger. The freshest of breezes skips across the scene, a dewy spume blown fromthe lips of a libidinous zephyr into a handmaiden’s billowing cloak. The shallowcomposition is Byzantine, as is the sharpness of line. Botticelli’s Venus isKenneth Clark’s Crystalline Aphrodite. She is a springtime goddess, showeredwith flowers of mathematical articulation. There is no chthonian tangle orbrooding pregnancy in this nature. Every tendril and herb has a fine Apollonianidentity. The sea itself has no murky depth. Botticelli’s revised Venus is anApollonian idea. Female secrecy and entrapment are abolished in her frank, yetdecorous nudity, her perfect visibility. An air-blown or aerated womanliness:Raphael takes this from Botticelli for his genial Galatea. I find it again inthe modern Galatea, the Life magazine pin-up of Rita Hayworth.Image [../images/f0151-01.jpg]20. Sandro Botticelli, The Birth of Venus, 1485.The Birth of Venus is Botticelli’s cinematic resolution of the unsettling sexualcomplexities of his Primavera, another large, imposing painting (fig. 21[ch05.html#ch05fig21]). The Primavera is a black egg cracked open by The Birthof Venus. The transfer of tapestry design into paint in the Primavera produces asinister claustrophobia unacknowledged by scholarship. Because of its enclosedspace and atomized placement of figures, I classify the painting as decadent—thelast gasp of Gothicism. The umbrella pine is Botticelli’s favorite symbol ofcontracted omnipotent nature, overhanging human thought. In the Primavera, thedark grove is an emanation of Spring’s bulging womb, at the picture’s exactcenter. Why do we not rejoice with the promise of fertility? We seem to be inelegy, not pastoral. The spindly trunks, ashy leaves, and metallic fruit belongto Dante. There is a sunless sky we cannot reach. The trees are a spiritualstockade. The figures are separated by invisible barriers. Each is locked in anallegorical cell, oblivious to the others. Even the three dancing Graces averttheir eyes. Mercury turns his back on the whole scene, in superb indifference.He will pluck his own fruit, and of his own kind. This beautiful boy isDonatello’s David two years later. Puberty is fleshing him out. His hat, likehis attitude, is haughtier and more warlike. Like the Graces’ impenetrablefemale circle, androgynous Mercury is narcissistic and self-complete.Image [../images/f0152-01.jpg]21. Sandro Botticelli, Primavera, 1478.Across the way, Flora casts petals from her brimming, self-fecundated lap. Whatof her strange face framed by cropped male hair? After years of puzzling over myUffizi copy, I realized Botticelli has joined two faces together, as in thedream sequence of Bergman’s Persona. One half belongs to a female aristocrat,cool, chaste, and self-possessed. The other belongs to a coarse gutter waif,roguish and lewd. Love for sale. Botticelli has condensed the extremes of sexand caste in an unsettling fusion of Renaissance personae. Flora, as much asMercury, makes love to herself. The energies of the Primavera are boxed or, touse a term from English poetry, embowered. The zephyr so freely blowing in TheBirth of Venus is caught in the trees here, his wings tangled and his stoppedcheeks bursting. His impure thoughts dribble in leafy syllables from the lips ofan anxious nymph. The allegory of the Primavera, however it may be worked out,cannot explain away the picture’s chilling atmospherics, its decadent precisionof bleakness and elegance.Botticelli’s pictures have mood. This was something new in the history ofpainting. I say it came from the sexual aura of Donatello’s David, theApollonian corona which warns us away. Hauser speaks of Botticelli’s “effeminatemelancholy.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note11a] Eroticized melancholy is everywherein Botticelli, in angels, Madonnas, saints, boys, nymphs. It is extruded assubtle tints of rose, sepia, grey, pale blue. Similar color values in Pierodella Francesca do not have the same perverse effect. Why? Because Botticelli,unlike Piero, is a poet of sexual personae. Botticelli’s personalities have afixity and dreamy apartness. They offer themselves to the eye and yet rebuff ourintimacy. Within their nervous carved lines, they have a heaviness or density ofconsciousness. Their dispassionate faces are like the barred backdrop of thePrimavera, a cultivated closure.Donatello and Botticelli’s rediscovery of the Apollonian iconicism in westernpersonality comes to them as a homosexual conceptualization, as in Greek highclassicism. The Apollonian borderline, I said, is a turning away and a shuttingout. The sharp Botticellian line is part of the self-definition of Renaissancepersonality, its withdrawal from medieval Christianity and its reorientation insecular space. Botticelli’s unity of tone is produced by his figures’ awakenedyet entranced eyes. His personae, unreachable, contemplative, hover in a dreamvision. They have the materiality of pagan pictorialism. Their pale smooth fleshglitters with the aristocracy of Apollonian beauty, an artistic dynasty foundedin Egypt.This theatrical compounding of sexual personae with moody ambiance, sober andascetic in Botticelli, is reproduced and darkened by Leonardo da Vinci.Botticelli’s subtle atmospherics are so transparent they are easy to miss. Butin Leonardo a thundercloud of chiaroscuro is gathering. Leonardo, who melts theApollonian line in shadow, is linked to Botticelli by the motif of anobsessively repeated face, used for both sexes. Leonardo and Michelangelo,solitary and depressive, created the persona of the artist as spiritual quester,as much a man of ideas as any philosopher. For both men, art, science, andconstruction were intellectual substitutes for sex—not sublimation butundisguised aggression, a hostile domination of nature. Their celibacy and illtemper were correlated, rational responses to our outrageous extension in thesetyrannous bodies, branded with gender by mother nature. Leonardo dissected andanatomized the body to remove its female mysteries, unstringing muscles,detaching bones, even opening a womb to draw the huddled fetus. In hisinventions, from flying machines to engines of war, the laws of dynamics werecaptured by the mathematical male mind. Michelangelo, by titanic masculineathleticism, tried to hammer matter into servitude. After the breakup of theordered medieval cosmos, both men turned anxiety into megalomania, a fanaticalexpansion of the will. But Leonardo painted little. Even his finished works hada self-destruct quotient, like The Last Supper, with its experimental technique,which made the paint almost immediately begin to peel off the refectory wall.Image [../images/f0154-01.jpg]22. Leonardo da Vinci, Mona Lisa, 1503.Leonardo’s Mona Lisa is the premiere sexual persona of western art (fig. 22[ch05.html#ch05fig22]). She is the Renaissance Nefertiti, eternally watching.She is unnervingly placid. The most beautiful woman, making herself a perfectstillness, will always turn Gorgon. I spoke of the Mona Lisa as Leonardo’sapotropaion, his household charm of warding-off. She is an ambassador fromprimeval times, when earth was a desert inhospitable to man. She presides over alandscape of raw rock and water. The distant river’s snaky meander is theelusiveness of her cold daemonic heart. Her figure is a stable female delta, aperceptual pyramid topped with the mystic eye. But the background is deceptiveand incoherent. The mismatched horizon lines, which one rarely notices at first,are subliminally disorienting. They are the unbalanced scales of an archetypalworld without law or justice. Mona Lisa’s famous smile is a thin mouth recedinginto shadow. Her expression, like her puffy eyes, is hooded. The egglike headwith its enormous plucked brow seems to pillow on the abundant, self-embracedItalian bosom. What is Mona Lisa thinking? Nothing, of course. Her blankness isher menace and our fear. She is Zeus, Leda, and egg rolled into one, anotherhermaphrodite deity pleasuring herself in mere being. Walter Pater is to callher a “vampire,” coasting through history on her secret tasks. Despite manysatires, the Mona Lisa will remain the world’s most famous painting. Supremewestern works of art, like Oedipus Rex and Hamlet, preserve their indeterminacythrough all interpretation. They are morally ungraspable. Even the Venus de Milogained everything by losing her arms. Mona Lisa looks through us and passivelyaccepts our admiration as her due. Some say she is pregnant. If so, she radiatesthe solipsism of woman gloating over her own creation. The picture combinesfleshy amplitude, emotional obliqueness, and earthly devastation. Leonardo hasdrawn mother nature from life.Image [../images/f0155-01.jpg]23. Leonardo da Vinci, Virgin and Child with St. Anne, 1508–10.In his major female paintings, Leonardo recloses the bright open space of TheBirth of Venus, the temporary reprieve Botticelli’s Apollonian metric wonagainst the entanglements of procreative nature. Leonardo’s sfumato, orsmokiness, is a chthonian leakage, a spreading miasma. The Madonna of the Rocks(1483–90) is backed by a looming cavern and a forest of ancient stalagmites,brute ziggurats or phallic totems. The women of the Virgin and Child with St.Anne totter at the edge of a stony cliff, harsh and barren (fig. 23[ch05.html#ch05fig23]). In the distance is a ghostly moonscape, like blastedGothic cathedrals. These peaceful scenes of mother and child have a chthonianundertow, threatening to suck us back to earth-cult. Mona Lisa’s ambiguous smileis a hieroglyph symbolizing the link between Leonardo’s sexual personae andtheir enshrouding atmosphere, a strange light which is their own stormy innerweather. The same smile appears on Leda and both women of The Virgin with St.Anne and even on two male figures, St. John the Baptist and its twin Bacchus,where smile and pointing finger turn seductive and depraved. So Leonardo’s smileis androgynous, a sexual hex sign. It is beginning to bud on the lips of thegesturing angel of The Madonna of the Rocks, a male so feminine that studentsseeing the picture for the first time insist he is a woman.Freud traces the mysterious smile to Leonardo’s buried memory of the lostbiological mother preceding his adoptive mother, the two women of The Virginwith St. Anne. Freud connects the painting to Leonardo’s childhood dream of abird of prey, the hermaphroditic Egyptian vulture goddess, Mut. Meyer Schapirorejects Freud’s reasoning and claims the source of the Leonardo smile is in hismaster Verrocchio. The grouping of the two women was traditional, says Schapiro,their oddly close ages signifying “the theological idealization of Anne as thedouble of her daughter Mary.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note12a] But there isnothing sinister or disturbing in the gentle Verrocchio. I trace the smile allthe way back through Botticelli to Donatello and find it amoral, solipsistic,and gender-crossing from the start. Leonardo injected Verrocchio with his ownperversity: one of his earliest works is the androgynous angel he painted as anapprentice in Verrocchio’s Baptism of Christ (1472).Freud rightly senses uncanniness in Leonardo’s doubling of St. Anne and theVirgin. Mary seems not so much sitting on Anne’s lap as slipping off it. Thefigures are like photographic superimpositions, two images seen simultaneously,eerie and hallucinatory. Yes, the women are doubles, just like Demeter andPersephone. Both Farnell and Frazer comment on Greek depictions of divine motherand daughter as “twin-sisters,” their “identity of substance” symbolizing thestages of vegetable growth.13 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note13a] In Leonardo’scharcoal cartoon (1499) and finished panel, St. Anne’s magnetic attentiveness toher companion seems menacingly or lasciviously intense. Anne’s blocky fist of agesture in the cartoon turns into a mannish, piratical hand on hip in thepainting. Love in Leonardo is never normal. His mystic doubling of Anne andMary, their uncertain spatial placement and ambiguous smiles, and the bleachedlandscape give the painting an archetypal power found nowhere else inRenaissance art except in Michelangelo. St. Anne and the Virgin are joined inautocratic nature-rule. These divine twin sisters are one archaic personalitythat has parthenogenetically cloned itself. Life is an endless series ofself-replicating females. Leonardo reverses Genesis, so it is maleness, in thechubby infant Jesus, that is successive and subordinate to femaleness. But asthe grotesque landscape shows, this is no celebration of female power. LikeMichelangelo, Leonardo finds the condition of male servitude intolerable, andrightly so.I give the name “allegorical repletion” to the doubling of The Virgin with St.Anne. The term describes a redundant proliferation of homologous identities in amatrix of sexual ambiguity. Allegorical repletion is present in the Hymenepisode ending Shakespeare’s As You Like It; in the incestuous mirroring ofcharacters and family names of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights; and in twosurreal Rossetti paintings, Astarte Syriaca and The Bower Meadow, which containominously multiple versions of a single melancholy female face. Leonardo’ssuffocating doubling of figures in The Virgin with St. Anne is another versionof Mona Lisa’s stolid, self-contained hermaphroditism. We now know what apregnant Mona Lisa carries within her: her fetal twin. The theme of Leonardo’stwo paintings is the same: the male eye and psyche flooded by female power.Leonardo’s neatest composition is The Last Supper (1495–98). Is there aconnection between the all-male Passover party and the regular, rationalmathematical design of the room, with its perspective lines converging behindChrist’s head? Male space makes sense in Leonardo. But female space is crowded,murky, eccentric, destabilizing. Leonardo’s paintings may be so few in numberbecause the journey from idea to rectangular picture plane was beset with femaledaemons. Science and engineering, then as now, are Apollonian havens from thevertigo of gender.Both Leonardo and Michelangelo are commonly classified as homosexual, butwhatever sex they may have had was surely rare and anomalous. The monasticstrain runs deep in the Italian temper. Freud observes that it is emotionalattraction, not physical activity which proves sexual orientation. In theirprivate lives, Leonardo and Michelangelo were evidently interested only in malebeauty. Of course, they had no real private lives apart from art and intellect.They were half-mad visionaries, as misanthropic as hermit saints. Theirritualistic cultism was a natural flowering of Mediterranean paganism:extremism, militancy, and hieraticism are always near at hand for the ItalianCatholic. Leonardo and Michelangelo’s homosexuality was part of their angryquest for autonomy of imagination, against everyone and everything—parents,teachers, friends, rivals, society, nature, religion, God. The western dynamicof conflict and combat is crystal-clear in them. They have no Christian charityor generosity, only pagan hunger to conquer, surpass, subdue by force. We tooare their subjects. Their dominance demands our submission. The two geniuses ofthe High Renaissance remake art by making art aggressive. Homosexuality inLeonardo and Michelangelo was intellectual as well as erotic, in the westernway. It was a resistance to the grossest of human dependencies, our enslavementby nature.Why was Michelangelo so productive as an artist and Leonardo so frustrated?Michelangelo’s total output was staggering, a virtuosity in sculpture, painting,and architecture unparalleled in the history of the arts. The vigor and vitalityof the Renaissance flowed into him, as into Shakespeare. Why did Leonardocomplete so little? My answer is that his technique and theme were at odds.Style and sexual personae sabotage each other. The smokiness of sfumato isDionysian mistiness, the fog hanging over the chthonian swamp. DecadentEuripides, we saw, uses Dionysian liquidity to destroy Apollonian Aeschylus. ButLeonardo is a high classicist, an archon of the mathematical mind. He wants tosubdue mother nature, but in depicting her, he allows her to dictate his style.Sfumato is her game. The more he plays it, the less he can paint. Even theself-dissolving Last Supper is infected by her.Michelangelo, on the other hand, an athlete stonecutter, began with sculptureand retained its Apollonian laws in painting, which the pope forced on him inthe Sistine Chapel. Oil painting and color, said Michelangelo, are for “womenand the lazy.” His sharp-edged Apollonian style is the only way to beat backmother nature. It is the hieratic signature of the western will. This is whyLeonardo’s sketches and private notebooks, with their Apollonian pen line, areso voluminous. But there is never a final victory in fighting nature.Michelangelo was locked into a pattern of endlessly renewed anxiety. Again andagain and again. To the end of his long life, Michelangelo leapt from labor tolabor, piling up the man-mountain of his stunning achievement. He converted aquest for freedom into another enslavement, sweat-stained, day blurring intonight. His bequest is the most brilliant series of Apollonian images sinceAthens’ revival of Egypt’s royal glamour.Michelangelo’s huge David (1501–04) is companion to Mona Lisa in the star chartof Renaissance sexual personae. The original, removed in 1873 from the weather,is enshrined in a simple temple of pagan design. It is a true kouros,Donatello’s David as teenaged athlete, a sinewy boy-man. We see him beforeaction rather than after. He glares toward Goliath along a plane of theaggressive western eye. His body is half-resolute, half-apprehensive, the leftleg shrinking away but sending its energy into the hand-held stone, about torise to the slingshot. In its monumentality and armoured hardness, David is anapotheosis of the male body as Apollonian perfection. The tension of male willhas contracted the torso, so head and hands seem overlarge. This contraction isa sexual condensation, a homoerotic defeat of female murk and interiority. TheDavid overwhelms the pilgrim viewer by its blazing solar radiation, its defiantdomination of space. The very air around it seems as impenetrable as the bodyitself. David, like Michelangelo, fends us off. The dreaminess of Donatello’scharmer is gone. Michelangelo’s David is awakened western consciousness,studying the enemy in the cold hostile light of Apollonian day.Michelangelo’s obsessive theme is glorified maleness. Moses (1513–15) Hellenizesanother Biblical persona. It is an astonishing improvisation on pagan images.The rippling Belvedere Torso swells Moses’ bulging biceps. The serpentineundulations of the just-excavated Laocoön spill through the long beard, trappingMoses’ index finger, his own halted motivation. Massed Greek draperies hang onthe powerful leg like a shroud. The Hebraic lawgiver, letting slip the stonetablets, breaks his own code. Like David, he glares furiously to the left. Hesees the golden idol of his fickle people. But the artist raises Moses as a newidol, Zeus-Jehovah, a theatrical amalgam of intellectual and physical force.Moses makes God in his own image. And Michelangelo creates as an entrancingfather-figure the one sexual persona more virile than he.The Moses’ maleness is absolute. It drives femaleness out of existence. Thereare no mothers in this cosmos. Only monumental Assyrian relief has suchpropagandistic machismo. We come to the limit of sexual representation. Thefemale body can never attain such grandiosity of assertion. Moses is anidealization, but its exaggerations are of normal physical contours produced inmen by male hormone. This definitive articulation and massiness of muscle andjoint are unavailable to women except through automedication with steroids. JohnAddington Symonds says that “the superiority of male beauty” consists in “thecomplete organization of the body as the supreme instrument of vital energy.”14[ch25_notes.html#ch05note14a] I agree. When admiring the sleek body of a womanathlete, I see androgyny, not femaleness. I honor her capture of a male mode.Moses is specifically western in its masculinity. Nothing in the art of othercultures resembles it in stature or abundant facial hair. Michelangelo’selectrifying icon of the Hebrew iconoclast is a racist paradigm of Greekphysical culture. The Apollonian, I said, is a Dorian and therefore Aryanaesthetic. Moses challenges modern liberal pieties on every front. It is beautyas power, beyond ethics.Michelangelo’s exaltation of maleness deforms his depiction of women. Like manyRenaissance artists, he used male models for female figures, since a womanposing nude was scandalous. But from the evidence of his surviving drawings,Michelangelo never sketched any woman from life, dressed or not. Furthermore,the cross-sexual origin of his female figures has left a strong visual residue.The best examples are the Sibyls of the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The earlydrawing for the Libyan Sibyl is obviously of a male model, whose athleticphysique survives in the final figure. The Delphic and Eritrean Sibyls havestartlingly heavy male arms. The old Cumaean Sibyl is one of the most fantasticsexual personae in art (fig. 24 [ch05.html#ch05fig24]). She has grim wizenedfeatures yet bursting breasts, fat as pumpkins. Her lumbering shoulder and armare brawny beyond human maleness. She is witch, hag, wet nurse. She isMichelangelo’s Mona Lisa, mother nature in the flesh, old as time but teemingwith coarse fertility.Cousins to the Sibyls are the reclining female nudes of the Medici Chapel(1520–34), products of Michelangelo’s Mannerist late phase. No one knows whatthese figures mean or even what they should be called. Anxious Dawn, lifting alistless hand, flexes her male bicep. Night bares a hammy haunch as she twistsin restless half-sleep, her abdomen ridged like a washboard (fig. 25[ch05.html#ch05fig25]). The women’s breasts are knobby protuberances stuck tomale torsos. Clark calls them “humiliating appendages.”15[ch25_notes.html#ch05note15a] Night’s choppy nipples are angry and puckered. Whowould care to suck such sour pippins? Among Renaissance personae, Michelangelo’smassive females, including Leda and the muscular Madonna of the Doni Tondo,belong to a sexual cabal. I classify them as viragos, uniquely blending male andfemale. With Night as my model, I define the virago as a fusion of Great Motherand Amazon, but without the fecundity of the former or free movement of thelatter. Like Artemis, the Amazon has an adolescent body type. But the virago islarge-breasted, sexually mature, her body heavy and inert. She is spirituallyimprisoned and poisoned. Jeanne Duval, Baudelaire’s bisexual harlot Muse, wassuch a sterile virago, indolent and self-thwarting. Baudelaire in fact wrote averse about Michelangelo’s Night (“The Ideal”). The virago is one of our darkestandrogynes. The Medici Chapel nudes, perched uncomfortably on their slippery,too-small tombs, labor and bring forth nothing. Night is a Gorgon Mona Lisa whohas devoured her own rocky landscape. The virago is self-enclosed, paralyzed,and dyspeptic.In art, monumentality or abstraction impersonalizes and therefore masculinizeswomen. This principle applies to Michelangelo, the Nefertiti bust, and Assyrianrelief, with its beefy muscle-bound goddesses. Michelangelo’s women are not allandrogynes. There is winsome Eve peeking brightly from the crook of God’s arm inthe Creation of Man. And there is the pure, tranquil Virgin of the Rome Pietà.But in both cases, the female body is largely concealed. Eve and Mary’sappealing femininity is made possible for Michelangelo by suppression of theirbodies. Moreover, the women appear with two of his most magnificent male nudes,who absorb his imagination. Eve and Mary are handmaidens of a sublime butenervated masculinity, without which Michelangelo would never dream of bringingthem into being. Adrian Stokes calls the Sistine God’s flaring, creature-packedcloak a “uterine mantle.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note16a] So Eve is just aparticle subdivided from a hermaphrodite male deity. The medieval MadonnaMisericordia, tenting humanity beneath her wings, has been robbed of her garmentby the aggressive Sistine God.Image [../images/f0161-01.jpg]24. Michelangelo, Cumaean Sibyl, 1508–12.Image [../images/f0162-01.jpg]25. Michelangelo, Night, 1525–31.Michelangelo’s life work is an epic in which femininity plays little part. Hislyric poetry resembles Shakespeare’s sonnets in its dual inspiration: abeautiful boy, Tommaso Cavalieri, and a potent woman, Vittoria Colonna, whocombines the sexes. I cited, apropos of the Delphic oracle, Michelangelo’ssalute to Colonna as “a man, a god rather, inside a woman.” This makesmythologically intelligible his depiction of the Sibyls as half-male viragos.Michelangelo’s late admiration for the pious Colonna, who took to a conventafter her husband’s death, has been misunderstood as romance by manycommentators. She became one of Michelangelo’s sexual personae, but she inspiredno eroticism. She was a hermaphrodite Muse, a voice of judgment, appealing tohis admiration for hierarchic force. She did not exist as a body. She was aninvisible mother-father, hovering like the Sistine Sibyls midway between heavenand earth.Michelangelo, we have seen, invested his imaginative energies nearly exclusivelyin masculinity. But an occult rule of his art is that the masculine is inconstant danger of melting into the feminine. Consider as a sexual persona theMedici Chapel’s idealized portrait of Giuliano de’ Medici, Duke of Nemours (fig.26 [ch05.html#ch05fig26]). This statue repeats the pose of the awesome Moses,but it is hemmed in its narrow niche in Mannerist closure, the imprisonment oflate-phase art. Michelangelo packs Donatello’s free male figure back into itsGothic pen. Despite its vigorous athleticism, the Giuliano has a wonderfulhalf-female glamour. The neck supporting the Apollo Belvedere head is sinuous,swanlike, and feminine. The torso is suggestively explicit. First, the breastsare excessively developed for a male. Second, the torso is a brilliant fantasiaon the cuirasse esthetique, the molding of a Roman leather or bronze breastplateto the personal imprint of the chest. Vasari says of the Giuliano, “The verybuskins and cuirass seem not of this world.”17 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note17a] Thechest and abdominal muscles are fluent, tactile, sensual. Michelangelo sopersuasively reproduces human skin folds on the cuirass’s caul-like transparencythat the metal shoulder clamps seem to be biting into living flesh. I alwaysthink of the nipple-piercing pins in sadomasochistic sex shops. Surely thislurid motif has come to Michelangelo from the Capitoline bust of the emperorCommodus draped in Hercules’ lion-skin, open jaws capping his head and clawsresting on his chest. But Michelangelo perversely sexualizes it. Unlike hispensive brother Lorenzo, sitting across the chapel in an ordinary cuirass,Giuliano is exquisitely autoerotic.Michelangelo likes to stress the male chest. Of examples like the mighty Christof The Last Judgment, Clark speaks of “that strange compulsion which made himthicken a torso till it is almost square,” “almost a deformation.”18[ch25_notes.html#ch05note18a] Giuliano’s chest has erotic delicacy and theintelligence and sensibility one normally expects of a face. John Pope-Hennessysays Michelangelo was “deeply uninterested” in portraiture.19[ch25_notes.html#ch05note19a] Michelangelo’s only portrait, as Vasari exclaims,is of the beautiful Tommaso Cavalieri. I propose that the luxurious chest ofGiuliano de’ Medici is the second of Michelangelo’s homosexual portraits. It isanalogous to the glossy buttocks of the Kritios Boy, which borrow artisticenergy from the still, sober, high classic face. Giuliano’s flesh-piercingornaments are subliminally sodomitic. They are an iron pen filling the blankpage of the torso with flowing erotic script. The male torso is Michelangelo’slandscape, the broad stage of human experience and action. Giuliano’s moundedbreasts are forbidden Cities of the Plain.Image [../images/f0164-01.jpg]26. Michelangelo, Giuliano de’ Medici, 1531–34.Giuliano de’ Medici belongs to a category of Renaissance androgyne separate fromthat of the beautiful boy. I call it “Epicoene, or the man of beauty,” after BenJonson’s transvestite play, Epicoene, or The Silent Woman. The man of beauty hasan active, athletic adult maleness. But in insolent narcissism, he retains anephebic transsexual quality, expressed in a feminine alabaster skin, herearising from the dazzling white marble. Three other examples of my Epicoenecategory are George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham, Lord Byron, and ElvisPresley, all dangerous men of notorious charisma.Gender in the Giuliano is barely held in balance by the male military regalia.The foursquare male chest of resolute western will is disordered by theserpentine disengagement of the curvy neck. A feminine masochism is beginning toencroach upon the statue through the limp flipped wrist and pierced breasts. Thetheme of masochistic sensuality is already present in the so-called Dying Slave,one of a series of “Captives” for the uncompleted tomb of Julius II (fig. 27[ch05.html#ch05fig27]). The huge statue (height 7′ 6½″) is usually explained inNeoplatonic terms as a symbol of the soul’s struggle against the body. But thetheory leaves too much emotional overflow. Leg flexed, the languid Dying Slaveposes like a beauty queen, voluptuously postorgasmic. The cross-sexual elementcomes partly from the statue’s Greek models, both female: a wounded Niobid andthe Dying Amazon, with raised arm. The Dying Slave is a sexual reversal ofMichelangelo’s alertly masculine David, whose leg placement it parodies. Aphantasmic band of cloth winds the eroticized chest, touched by dainty fingersof onanistic tenderness, a gesture borrowed from Donatello’s early marble David.The combination of athletic male physique with female mood and body language isperverse. It turns the milder flaunting of Donatello’s bronze David intodecadent sexual cultism, an ecstasy of sadomasochistic bondage. The Dying Slave,backed by the lurking ape of bestial instinct, is a pagan crucifix. This is agratified St. Sebastian who has swallowed his tormentors’ shafts. He drifts inhis own perfect fantasy. When as a youngster I saw a picture of this statue, Iwas fascinated by its blatant eroticism, which scholarship, in its quick escapeto allegory, studiously ignores.The Victory (1532–34) is another of Michelangelo’s provocative works ofsexualized theater: a beautiful youth with cruelly blank Donatello face crusheshis knee upon a hogtied older man, whose bearded face resembles Michelangelo’s.Is the defeated elder the Old Adam of experience? Yawn. Sexual personae are thered flame of Renaissance imagination. Victory is a homage to Donatello’s David,who treads the grizzled head of Goliath. In the psychic force-field of theaggressive western eye, beauty dominates the observer. All-dominatingMichelangelo is undone and humiliated by his own homosexual eye. The beautifulboy, with his beckoning feminine hand, is an angel-vampire leaping up withMichelangelo’s repressed energy, the burden of his jailed self. I cannot beconvinced that great artists are moralists. Art is first appearances, thenmeaning. The Dying Slave and Victory, as well as the twenty exhibitionisticallyself-twining ignudi or nude youths of the Sistine ceiling, are complex pagan sexobjects. These works resemble Spenser’s Faerie Queene in the way that moralallegory has wandered into prurient sexual naturalism.Image [../images/f0166-01.jpg]27. Michelangelo, Dying Slave, 1513–16.Michelangelo’s primary principle is the quest for Apollonian form. His figuresmust exert enormous pressure to keep their shape. Our and the artist’s eye mustremain vigilant and aggressive. The dialectic between definitiveness anddissolution is evident as early as Bacchus (1497). “Androgynous and seductive,”in Robert Liebert’s phrase, Michelangelo’s boyish wine-god careens unsteadily,offering us his lifted cup.20 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note20a] But the seduction ismore than sexual. Major western sculpture, I said, is Apollonian. ThereforeBacchus staggering is Apollonian form seduced by the chthonian, deliquescing.Mother earth calls. Michelangelo never has to use Bacchus overtly again, sincehis figures artistically assimilate the Dionysian theme. Clark speaks of “afeeling of thundery oppression” in Michelangelo’s torsos. Stokes sees in thesculpture and painting “a state of uneasy passivity, known to us in terms of anoppressive weight.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch05note21a] What is it that oppressesMichelangelo’s figures? His terribilità (“awesomeness” or “fearfulness”) is themalign gravitation of mother nature, who dissolves all forms in her cycle ofchange and remaking. The Apollonian line asserts the identity of objects.Sculptural contour is so emphatic in Michelangelo because of the danger offeminine surrender to nature.Like Greek artists indifferent to landscape, Michelangelo makes the male figurethe field of combat. His resistance to nature is like William Blake’s: both menare obsessed with the dream of a world generated and sustained by masculinityalone. To materialize that world, the choleric Michelangelo drove himself withremorseless athleticism, a hyperbolic titanism. But a wholly masculine cosmos isuntenable. It cannot last even when erected by a genius. Consequently,Michelangelo’s male figures are exhausted with their effort and helplesslyinfected by femininity, which shimmies upward from a spiritually opaquegravitational center. The pornographic fluorescence of the Dying Slave comesfrom its will-lessness, its sensually engorged surrender. The ruggedly masculineMichelangelo, like Ernest Hemingway, required rituals of male inflation to fightoff the lure of transsexual submission. Mother nature turns us all to eunuchs.Nearly everything in Michelangelo has some sexually disturbing undercurrent.Effeminates cavort behind the Holy Family of the Doni Tondo, pagan desireescaping Christian control. The Sistine ignudi seem like castrates, rituallytormented initiates of an unknown cult. Even the great Pietà, surely partlyinspired by Botticelli’s Venus and Mars, is a tableau of female immortality andperishable manhood. In archetypal terms, has the Holy Mother not drained herson? Morbidezza, the Pietà’s softness or delicacy of modelling, also means“effeminacy” in Italian. Perhaps the Medici Chapel nudes are less masculinewomen than men being transformed, as in a nightmare, into women. Michelangelo’ssexual ambiguities are apotropaic formulas, repeating what is feared in order todrive it off.Intransigent Michelangelo is the best example of the western aesthetic ofperceptual control. The art object, in its Apollonian unity and clarity, is aprotest against the too-muchness of nature. Late in Michelangelo’s career, themultiplicity of objects rebounds, breaking back into the Mannerist Last Judgment(1536–41) and filling it with a dithery mass of churning bodies. But by thispoint the artist is starting to flag in his Apollonian enterprise. Turning, likeDonatello and Botticelli, back to the church, he portrays himself as a shapelessflayed skin in St. Bartholomew’s grasp and leaves his mammoth figureshalf-buried in stone. Apollonian form deflates or aborts. Matter has won.Renaissance Apollonianism originated in Florence and spread to Rome. Itsemphatic sharp edge, descending through Byzantine style from the Greek kouros,was initially a homosexual idea, a line drawn against female nature. It thenpassed into general artistic usage and lost its secret polemicism. Florentineintellectuality and Florentine homosexuality were linked phenomena. Beautifulboys, everywhere in Florentine art, rarely appear in Venetian painting, which isfull of luscious female nudes. Mercantile Venice did not seethe withphilosophers and crackpots, like Florence. In art, fleshy Venetian women,half-Oriental odalisques, relax in cordial landscapes—a far cry from Leonardo’sabandoned rock quarries. Venetian personae and Venetian landscape are equallyheterosexual. Venice’s appreciation of female beauty allowed acceptance ofrather than resistance toward nature. Was this not the result of the city’sunique physical character? Venice, veined by water, is in placid relation tomarine nature. Its people and artists imaginatively internalized femalefluidity, the prime chthonian principle. The Renaissance City of Art, a triumphof architectural ingenuity, was its own balance of Apollonian and Dionysian anddid not need to explore these ideas in painting. That balance was eventuallydisrupted by the ubiquity and omnipotence of Venetian water. The city rotted,flooded, and began to sink. Mann records its modern degeneration in Death inVenice.Hard-bodied boy-form is implicit in Florentine aesthetics. It surely influencedthe Florentine female nude, like Botticelli’s Venus, with her small breasts andtall, slim build. Procreativeness was neither a Florentine nor an Athenianvalue. The luxuriance savored by Venice in female curves was projected byFlorentine artists into men’s flowing hair, one of the most mesmerizing themesof Renaissance art. Like Michelangelo’s muscle-man Moses, this is a nativelywestern mode. Only Caucasians, a motley blend of ethnic types, have such avariety of hair colors and consistencies. Portrait art has made European hair agorgeous palette of sexual personae. In the Renaissance as now, a pretty boywith a long, fine head of hair has a drop-dead androgynous allure. All thosedashing Italian Renaissance ángels are crowned with pagan physicality.Raphael of Urbino, youngest of the three High Renaissance geniuses, divertedFlorence’s homoerotic glamour back toward the procreative female. He created theChristmas-card persona of the warm Madonna, a simple peasant girl of open faceand arms. Raphael was heavily influenced by Leonardo and Michelangelo, whoenabled him to break from his master Perugino, with his spare, bland,small-figured Northern European style. But Raphael takes the sexual ambiguityand psychological conflict out of Leonardo and Michelangelo. He does to themwhat Keats does to Coleridge, sweetening and purifying the daemonic, making thematernal a blessing rather than a curse. Raphael subtly corrects his teachers.His matchless glow of color, a half-liquid envelope of feminine emotion, is aclarification of Leonardo’s louring atmosphere. From the surviving portraits andself-portraits of all three artists, Raphael seems the most feminine in mannerand appearance. His turn toward woman prefigures the sexual shift oflate-Renaissance art.In Mannerism and Baroque, as in Hellenistic art, the sexes repolarize. Cellini’sPerseus, with whom we began, holds his scimitar at crotch level to punctuate hisvictory over the femme fatale, whose dripping head he brandishes aloft.Bernini’s David, a self-portrait, is stoutly masculine and in mad motion. Theandrogyny and Apollonian apartness of the first Renaissance Davids have beenredefined in late-phase terms. Bernini’s Apollo pursues a nymph melting into abristling tree. Metamorphosis is the Dionysian principle of Baroque illusionism.Bernini even stations four giant, undulating, brazen pagan serpents to hold upthe canopy over the main altar of Christendom. The supreme Baroque work, his St.Teresa in Ecstasy, a sex-parody of Renaissance Annunciations, makes the armedandrogyne merely a titillating boudoir provocateur. The orgasmic victim is infull sail on a Dionysian cloud. Woman, with all her vibrating internality, takescenter stage."},{"pageContent":"6SPENSER AND APOLLOThe Faerie QueeneEnglish literature is one of the supreme constructions in the history of art. Itis both music and philosophy, a sensory stream of thought feeding eachgeneration of writers from the Middle Ages to modernism. English literarydistinction begins in the Renaissance and is the creation of one man, EdmundSpenser. His epic poem, The Faerie Queene (1590, 1596), does for the EnglishRenaissance what painting and sculpture did for the Italian. Spenser isBotticelli’s heir. By his intuitive grasp of the hard-edged Apollonian line,Spenser puts English literature into the ancient dynasty of western sexualpersonae. The arts, except for portraiture, were weak in the EnglishRenaissance, partly because of Henry VIII’s destruction of Catholic images.Spenser recreates English pictorialism in poetic form. His influence upon laterwriters, beginning with Shakespeare, was incalculable. It was through Spenser’squarrel with himself that English literature gained its amazing complexity.Romantic poetry’s chthonian daemonism, for example, is a flowering of the secretrepressions of The Faerie Queene. We will see it pass from Coleridge to Poe toBaudelaire and beyond. Spenser invented the artistic vocabulary of Englishpoetry, which he turned into a meditation on nature and society, on sex, art,and power.At the moment, The Faerie Queene is a great beached whale, marooned on thedesert shores of English departments. Spenser is a hostage of his own critics,who have thrown up a thicket of unreadable commentary around him. Renaissancestudies are woefully over-specialized; a lurid era has been reduced to a jumbleof multilingual footnotes. Efforts to draw different arts or nations into oneframe of reference are resisted. Even Spenser and Shakespeare are rarelydiscussed together. The Faerie Queene has been ruined for many students by thenumbingly moralistic way it is taught. Spenser spoke to other poets as a bard,not a preacher. And when bards summon the Muse, they themselves may not alwaysknow what they speak.Scholars begin English literature with Chaucer and list Spenser as his disciple.But English literature would have remained merely national if it had reallyfollowed Chaucer. I would argue that Spenser made English literature world-classonly by abandoning Chaucer and eradicating his influence. There is a huge shiftof style between the Chaucerian Shepheardes Calendar (1579), which madeSpenser’s name, and The Faerie Queene, begun the same year. Pastoral eclogue wasa pagan genre, adopted by apprentice Vergil, but The Shepheardes Calendar ismedieval Christian in tone and detail.Through his friendship with Sir Philip Sidney, an advocate of Castiglione’saristocratic ideals, and through his devotion to the queen, to whom he dedicatedThe Faerie Queene, Spenser reawoke the mystic hieraticism of power latent inwestern sexual personae. The mass glorification of Elizabeth I revived theradiant laws of Apollonian beauty. Her portraits are Byzantine icons, stifflyceremonial and encrusted with jewels. I spoke of the origins of Botticelli’shard edge in Byzantine art and Donatello’s sculpture. We know Spenser wasfamiliar with some Botticelli: that he modelled a major sex scene in The FaerieQueene on Botticelli’s Venus and Mars was one of the earliest observations ofSpenser criticism. Copies of Italian art came to England largely in the form ofengravings, a new technique that would intensify hard Apollonian contours andadd them even when absent in the original. The Faerie Queene has an Apollonianbrilliance found nowhere in Spenser’s medieval or Renaissance sources, includingAriosto, who lacks his asperity and iconicism, his concentration and hard edge.The Faerie Queene turns to pagan style to defeat Christian Chaucer. My theory ofcomedy puts Oscar Wilde in the same haughty Apollonian line as Spenser.Chaucer’s comic persona resembles that of Charlie Chaplin’s Little Tramp, whom Iseem to be alone in loathing. Chaucer’s humanism is predicated on the commonman, on our shared foibles and frailties, our daily muddle. He absolves hisadmirers of guilt. There is no fear and trembling in his theology. Chaucer’sconviviality is full of winks, chuckles, and nudges. The hearty warmth of it allmakes my skin crawl. Chaucer is a populist, while Spenser is a hierarchist. TheFaerie Queene, like Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest, is aristocratic inform and content. Chaucer, and here is his continuing appeal, accepts the flesh.But the Apollonian resists nature by its hostile eye-drawn line. For me, readingChaucer is like fighting through cattails while being worried by midges. Thereare too many words, Gothic flutters and curlicues. Portraiture in The CanterburyTales has a scratchy, rustling detail coming, like Northern European painting,from manuscript illumination. In Greco-Roman terms, it is a coy, labored style.Wise Chaucer, putting roses in the cheeks of medieval asceticism, opposesabsolutism and extremism in all things. But the idealizing Apollonian mode isabsolutist and extremist from the first architectural overstatements of OldKingdom Egypt. Western greatness is unwise, mad, inhuman.Revolutionary Spenser puts the eye into English poetry. Horace’s theory that apoem should be like a picture was much discussed in the Renaissance. But Spensergoes far beyond this. Image, A. C. Hamilton rightly insists, is as crucial asallegory.1 [ch25_notes.html#ch06note1a] The aggressive eye is theconceptualizing power of The Faerie Queene and the master of its largest ideas.Spenser is history’s first theorist of aggression, anticipating Hobbes, Sade,Darwin, Nietzsche, and Freud. Only Leonardo and Michelangelo before him hadstruggled with the moral problem of the awakened eye. Spenser’s pagan eye burnscozy Chaucer right out of English poetry. Not since Homer had there been socinematic a poet. Spenser’s long blazing sightlines prefigure the epic sweep offilm and the probing light-beam of the projector. The opening up of secularspace in Italian painting through perspective is paralleled in the vastdistances of The Faerie Queene. Spenser’s typical moment is the glancing oflight off the armour of a faraway knight. Who or what is it? We never hear aname until the scene is nearly over. Spenser, as much as Donatello, understandsthe meaning of medieval armour as a vehicle of western pagan identity. Spenseris an Apollonian thing-maker in the tradition linking stony Pharaoh Chephren tomodern metal cans and cars.Personality in Spenser is armoured, an artifact of aggressive forging. The themeof The Faerie Queene is the same one I found in Michelangelo, a conflict betweendefinitiveness and dissolution of self. In the Renaissance, sex has a dangerousfreedom. That barbaric power consigned to the medieval Hell now waits in everyglade, returned to its old place in nature. The western eye, creator of thesharp boundaries of selfhood, is sucked into will-lessness by the lure ofsensual beauty. To preserve its autonomy, the Spenserian eye suspends itself invoyeurism, a tactic of defense that turns into perversion. Judaism had avoidedthis dilemma by elevating the word and banishing the eye. But Christianity,assimilating pagan art, was divided against itself from the moment it leftPalestine. Spenser’s profound study of the amoral dynamics of the western eyemakes The Faerie Queene the supreme work of Renaissance literature until Hamlet,which uses Spenserian voyeurism in virtually every scene.The Apollonian line to which The Faerie Queene belongs began in Egypt and Greeceand passes through Donatello, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Blake, and Shelley tothe Pre-Raphaelite painters and Oscar Wilde. It then reappears in cinema, whichwas implicit in western art and thought from the start. The Faerie Queene makescinema out of the west’s primary principle: to see is to know; to know is tocontrol. The Spenserian eye cuts, wounds, rapes. Since Vasari, artists have beendivided into draughtsmen and colorists, practitioners of Wölfflin’s painterlystyle. The argument flares in the nineteenth century, when Blake rejectschiaroscuro as mud and when rough-brushed Delacroix opposes clean-lined Ingres.Spenser uses the incising draughtsman’s pen. Direct contact with Botticelli wasunnecessary, since the Apollonian style was latent in medieval armour, in whichSpenser clothes so many characters. Spenserian armour is western personalityimagined as discrete and indissoluble, cohesive and luminous.The sex and glamour of the armour-infatuated Faerie Queene separate it from amore faithfully Protestant work like its descendant, Pilgrim’s Progress (1678).Upstairs, downstairs: Bunyan’s kitchen Spenser returns allegory to its legiblemedieval form, as in the morality plays. Pilgrim’s Progress makes a charminglydirect path between simple image and simple message, which the Bible allows usto decode. But in the tricky Faerie Queene, Protestant individualism has beenusurped by a pagan aesthetic. In Spenser, as nowhere in Bunyan, we constantlycontemplate the ritual visibility of fabricated personality, a Greco-Roman idea.Armour is the Spenserian language of moral beauty, signifying Apollonianfinitude and self-containment.Spenser’s questing knights, isolated against empty panoramas, replay Apollo’shostility to nature. The west has always made Apollonian art objects out of armsof war (fig. 28 [ch06.html#ch06fig28]). The bronze carapace of Homer’s heroes isa male exoskeleton, the hardness of western will, a theme to return in adiscussion of American football in my next book. In Odysseus’ Ithaca, weaponsare kept on display in the banquet hall. In the Middle Ages, a shield hung onthe wall, as a painting would be in the Renaissance, was a badge of clanidentity. The heraldic crest is another Egyptian cartouche, a privileged sacredspace.Western culture has always been obsessed with severe burnished surfaces. Theelegant Corinthian Greek war helmet, for example, with its flat cheek-guards andkeyhole eyes, is an eerie superself, smooth as a staring skull (fig. 29[ch06.html#ch06fig29]). Eastern armour, in contrast, is squat, sinuous, andbushy. Asian art is based on the female curve, not the rigid male line. Easternarmour uses organic shapes, while western armour insists on technologicalinsulation from nature. The western soldier is a steely marching machine. TheJapanese Samurai is bristly and rotund; his armour seems pregnant, overgrown byvegetation. He is half-camouflaged, relapsing into female nature, like TheFaerie Queene’s leafy knight Artegall, who is in a spiritually unreconstructedcondition.Image [../images/f0174-01.jpg]28. Homogeneous Tilting Armour, German, 1580. Maker: Anton Peffenhauser,Augsburg.Compare the imperial tombs of Egypt and China. The Pharaohs’ mummiform granitesarcophagi or Tut’s fitted gold coffins are heavy and solid, fused from head tofoot. But the gleaming jade burial suits of Han princes are faceted and stitchedlike fish scales. Western Apollonianism is ungiving, impermeable, adamantine. Itis an aesthetic of closure. Donald Keene says Japanese sentences “trail off intothin smoke,” a vapor of hanging participles.2 [ch25_notes.html#ch06note2a] Inother words, Japanese sentences avoid closure. Even the sword blade, in the westa harsh phallic totem, is given an interior by Japanese connoisseurs, whoproject poetic landscapes into its hundred folded layers. Western armour isseparatist, dividing self from self and self from nature. Spenser’s armour isthe symbol of Apollonian externality, of strife and solar wakefulness. Itensures permanent visibility, personae hardened against their own sexualimpulses. In The Faerie Queene, nature lurks everywhere with her seductivedissolutions of surrender and repose.Image [../images/f0175-01.jpg]29. Greek Helmet. Corinthian type, late seventh to early sixth centuries B.C.Border of wave pattern.Arms and armour in The Faerie Queene symbolize male fortitude andself-assertion. We expect these qualities from heroes. But Spenser extends themto heroines, in a way that speaks directly to our time. His armed Amazons,Belphoebe and Britomart, are among the most potent women in literature. Spenserremoves the usual archetypal basis of female force, the daemonic, and imagineshis heroines as Apollonian angels. This had not been done since Greek Artemis.Spenser creates the new Renaissance cult of married love. As C. S. Lewisobserves, Spenser’s “romance of marriage” replaces the “romance of adultery” ofmedieval courtly love.3 [ch25_notes.html#ch06note3a] Before the Renaissance,poets sang of their mistresses but not of their wives. Marriage was autilitarian affair, having nothing to do with art. Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen,was urged to marry throughout her reign, to ensure a peaceful succession. TheFaerie Queene moves toward marriage but never reaches it (the poem is a merefragment of Spenser’s ambitious plan). The female knight Britomart is to wedArtegall and start the dynasty leading to Elizabeth and England’s greatness.Britomart’s maternal destiny introduces an image foreign to the Renaissance as awhole: a benevolent Great Mother, whom Spenser calls Great Dame Nature. We sawhow the androgynes of Italian art are usually beautiful boys and howdominatrixes, like Leonardo’s Mona Lisa or Michelangelo’s Night, tend to besinister or sterile. In Shakespeare too, with his staggering range of sexualpersonae, references to creative chthonian females are rare. Spenser’sattraction to the Great Mother is anomalous. He exalts her, where Cellini,decorating Perseus’ pedestal with Ephesian Artemis, defeats her. Britomartreverses Artemis’ evolution: she begins as the adolescent Apollonian androgyneand ends as the primeval mother goddess. Spenser’s Great Mother, like herancient precursors, is always double-sexed. In Venus’ Temple, the idol,serpent-twined like Roman statues of Atargatis or Dea Syria, exhibits thegenitalia of both sexes. She is “both male and female,” “sire and mother,”begetting and conceiving by herself alone (IV.x.41).4[ch25_notes.html#ch06note4a]Spenser’s recasting of sexual mythology is daring, original, and perhapsunsupportable. The grandest epic quest of The Faerie Queene is his own. He wantsto cleanse the procreative of its daemonic taint. Spenser’s Renaissance ideal ofmarriage cooperates with genre in his two famous epithalamia. But now in epic,with its more aggressive sexual personae, nature is not so easily contained. TheFaerie Queene tries to repair splits in Spenser’s own imagination. It tries toturn the foul cup of the Whore of Babylon into a Holy Grail.Spenser’s most militant instrument of Apollonian definition is chastity, aself-armouring of personality. St. Augustine calls continence “unity of self.”5[ch25_notes.html#ch06note5a] Virtue in The Faerie Queene means holding to one’svisible shape. In the human realm, formlessness or wanton metamorphosis isamoral. Only evil characters (Archimago, Duessa, Guyle, Proteus) change shape.The heroic Prince Arthur can transform other things but never alters himself.Hybrid beings (part dog, fox, dragon, hag) are always bad. This is the reason, Ithink, that Spenser was troubled by the five “Hermaphrodite stanzas,” which hemysteriously dropped from the poem after its first edition. Amoret and SirScudamour, embracing, melt into one another until they seem a RomanHermaphrodite statue. Spenser may have cancelled these stanzas because theyviolate his own Apollonian laws, trespassing the boundaries of form. In TheFaerie Queene, mutilation is horrific. Words like “misshapen” and “deformitee”recur. The human form is paradigmatic, as in the anatomical architecture of theHouse of Temperance (II.ix). Belphoebe and Britomart, personified chastity,express their radical autonomy in a blaze of self-generated light, the samelight that pours from the Olympian gods as patrons of aristocratic order. Thebody in Spenser is a social integer. Apollonian illumination and integrity ofform are art, politics, and morality all in one. Clarity of eye is purity ofbeing.The Elizabeth-inspired Amazons, Belphoebe and Britomart, are the greatest sexualpersonae of The Faerie Queene. They flood the verse with a strange golden light.St. Thomas Aquinas makes “brightness or clarity” a prime quality of beauty.6[ch25_notes.html#ch06note6a] Eliade says of Vishnu, “Mystically perfect beingsare radiant.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch06note7a] Burckhardt remarks that blonde wasthe ideal hair color of the Italian Renaissance. But Spenserian blondeness is amoral, not a cosmetic principle. Belphoebe and Britomart’s heraldic blondenessis analogous to their upper-class hermaphroditism. Dorian and authoritarianApollo, I said, is ice-blonde. Belphoebe’s Apollonian blondeness is atransparency, hard and clear. The whole Faerie Queene is a “world of glass,” aconstruct of visionary materialism (III.ii.19).Light seems to penetrate blonde forms, so they seem midway between matter andspirit. St. Gregory the Great, seeing fair-haired British boy slaves in Rome,exclaimed, “They are not Angles but angels” (Non Angli sed angeli). In bodytype, Belphoebe and Britomart are the Crystalline Aphrodite, like Botticelli’sVenus. All angels are ectomorphic. Spenser’s female angels, suppressing thematernal silhouette, approach the sexually indeterminate. The blondeness of hisheroines is a prism through which light is intensified and projected. Theradiance of the Olympian gods as objets d’art is identical to the glamour ofHollywood publicity in which Kenneth Burke sees “a hierarchic motive.”8[ch25_notes.html#ch06note8a] Movie stars of the Thirties and Forties,photographed in halos of shimmering light, had Spenserian glamour. They werearistocrats of a dark era of economic chaos and war. The camera’s idealizing eyegave them Apollonian power and perfection. The Amazons of The Faerie Queene shedlight because they too are produced by an instinct for hierarchy. This poem,like most English Renaissance literature, is inspired by a reverence for socialorder.Spenser and Shakespeare star beautiful female androgynes in their galaxy ofpersonae. Here the English Renaissance strongly departs from the Italian: therewere willful educated women like Caterina Sforza and Isabella d’Este, but theywere not the focus of Italian imagination. Perusing the stunning Italianportraits crammed into museums and palazzi, one is struck by the disparitybetween male and female representation. Italian men and boys are vivacious,ravishing; but the women seem placid, stolid, even stupid. The feminineconventions of shaved eyebrows and bulbous forehead don’t help. The divergenceis extreme in double facing portraits like Piero della Francesca’s of the Dukeand Duchess of Urbino or Raphael’s of Angelo and Maddalena Doni: the men arefully developed personalities, while their wives seem static and bland. Not onlycould respectable women not pose at leisure, but there was the Plotina effect: alady confines herself to one persona. Decorum means expressionlessness.Spenser and Shakespeare throw all this out the window. They love imperious,volatile women. England was governed by a charismatic spinster who boxed theears of her nobles and bashed ale flagons into tabletops. Her chief ministerLord Burghley said the queen was “more than a man and (in truth) sometimes lessthan a woman.” Not until Mannerism do aggressive real-life women finally make itinto Italian art. Bronzino, for example, captures the mannish profile of poetessLaura Battiferri, whom he calls, punning on her name, “all iron within, icewithout.” As for England, appreciation of fierce females did not survive theRenaissance, thanks to the upsurge of Puritanism. Early eighteenth-centuryportraits of noblewomen are as frigid and formulaic as those of the ItalianRenaissance. But Amazons were to stage a comeback in the Augustan salon, as weknow from The Rape of the Lock.So the liberated woman is the symbol of the English Renaissance, as thebeautiful boy is the symbol of the Italian. In The Faerie Queene, we see her infree movement. I speak, of course, of artistic projection and not of the life ofreal British women. But art is what transcends and survives. Of all truths, itis the finest. Belphoebe bursts into The Faerie Queene like a divine epiphany.Spenser gives her one of the most dazzling theatrical entrances in art.Narrative action stops dead, while ten long stanzas minutely describe herappearance. The Apollonian eye is locked in place. It is a privileged moment ofhieratic stillness and silence, as if a frame of film were frozen before us.Belphoebe, a huntress and solitary forest-dweller, recalls Venus disguised asDiana in the Aeneid. She resembles Penthesilea, “Queene of Amazons.” She carries“a sharpe boar-spear” and a bow and quiver “stuft with steele-headed darts.” Herface is the “heavenly portrait” of a “bright Angel,” rose-red and lily-white.She has an ivory brow. Her eyes dart “fiery beames,” full of “dread Majestie,”that quell lust. Her long, loose yellow hair, “crisped like golden wire,” islifted by the wind and flecked with falling flowers—which suggests Spenser hadalso seen copies of Botticelli’s Primavera or Birth of Venus or both. Belphoebewears a pleated white silk tunic, sprinkled with golden ornaments like twinklingstars. Her skirt has a gold fringe. Her gilt buskins are decorated with gold,enamel, and jewels. Her legs are like “marble pillars” supporting “the temple ofthe Gods” (II.iii.21–31).Belphoebe seems like a work of sculpture embedded in the text. Spenser’s lavishdescription, far longer than anything in Boiardo, Ariosto, or Tasso, has thestylization and high specificity of a Byzantine icon. Belphoebe is the ByzantineElizabeth. But she also has a high classic symmetry and mass, a mathematicalmeasure. With her white and gold Amazonian splendor, she is like thechryselephantine colossus of Athena in the Parthenon. Every detail and edge isdeeply incised, because Spenserian personality must be forcibly carved out ofobdurate nature and defended against the erosion and lassitude of fatigue orhedonism. The intricacies of Belphoebe’s golden hair and costume correspond tothe categories and subsets of the great chain of being, ascending Apollonianorder. Belphoebe’s hypervisibility is our own Apollonian consciousness, ouraggressive pagan eye. She is a masterpiece of western objectification, the sexobject that leaps from the brain and repels all touch.Belphoebe appears and disappears, like a dream vision. Not till a full booklater does Spenser disclose her birth and education. In Book Two, she is formaland abstract, a sudden manifestation of hierarchic power. With her grace,dignity, and arete, she may be a living illustration of the golden mean, theparable of Medina and her sisters in the prior canto. Belphoebe mediates betweenthe extremes of art and nature, masculinity and femininity. Her name means“beautiful Diana.” She carries “deadly tooles,” her male weapons (II.iii.37). Weusually see her caught up in bloodlust, fast on the red trail of fleeing prey. Awoman of “Heroick mind,” she intimidates by her monomania, evasion of physicalcontact, and want of ordinary homely emotion. Discovering the injured Timias,she is touched for the first time by pity, “soft passion and unwonted smart”(III.v.55, 30). Even binding his wounds, she remains austere and remote. She isimpenetrable, like the frosty, unknowable Garbo, in whom Roland Barthes sees anarchetypal impersonality.Belphoebe’s chastity is a form of hierarchic sequestration. Proclus says, “Thepeculiarity of purity is to keep more excellent natures exempt from such as aresubordinate.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch06note9a] The Apollonian universe ofdomination and submission permits no emotional involvement. Cold andself-complete, the Apollonian androgyne is isolated behind a wall of silence ormuteness. I find this narcissistic phenomenon in the Greek beautiful boy, Mann’senigmatic Tadzio, and Melville’s stammering Billy Budd. Compare Belphoebe’s oddhabit of dashing off in the middle of sentences. Exaltation of the Apollonianmode in The Faerie Queene tends to make the virtuous characters somewhatslow-witted! Belphoebe, for example, is given to rather dull speeches. Eloquencebelongs to evil characters, like seductively musical Despair (I.ix.38–47).Spenser invented the word “blatant,” meaning talk as noisy babbling. In thefirst canto, the pictorial Faerie Queene vomits its own words. Belphoebe’s lateradventures with Timias show her naturalistically: she has a reduced power,unlike the glory of her presence at first entrance. Spenser no longer showsApollonian radiance emanating from her because, with the advent of pity into herheart, Belphoebe has forfeited her Amazonian autonomy. She descends to the realmof human hurts from the empty zone of her Olympian mind.Self-sequestered Belphoebe stands apart from the main action of The FaerieQueene. But her Apollonian peer, Britomart, is one of the central protagonists,with a whole book and more devoted to her. She is chastity with an enchantedspear, the poem’s only invincible knight. We first see her through the hostileeyes of Prince Arthur and Guyon, who think her a man. They see her as a mirrorimage of themselves, a warrior in full armour. During the ensuing skirmish,Spenser calls Britomart “he,” deceiving us as well. Then he reveals her sex tous in an aside and switches to “she” for the rest of the joust, which we nowwatch with quickened attention (III.i). He uses this transsexual trick ofperspective twice more, when Britomart approaches Malbecco’s house and when shechallenges and defeats Artegall (III.ix.12; IV.iv.43). Spenser’s sleight of handwith grammatical gender, like his withholding of characters’ names, seems to bepart of his prescient insight into the problematic nature of perception andidentity.Trouncing the poem’s leading men, Britomart is a paragon of knightly prowess.Spenser summarizes her double sexual nature: “For she was full of amiable grace,/ And manly terrour mixed therewithall” (III.i.46). She inspires both love andfear, appealing to the eye but subduing the spirit. This is a pagan synthesis.Like Belphoebe, Britomart throws off a dazzling angel light. We see her onlywhen she disarms, a sudden revelation the more overwhelming. “Her golden locks,”falling to her heels, are “like sunny beames” bursting from a cloud, “goldengleames” shooting “azure streames” through the air (III.ix.20). Later, doffingher “glistring helmet,” she lets her golden hair fall “like a silken veile”about her body. It is like “the shining sky in summer’s night,” the day’s“scorching heat” now “crested all with lines of fiery light, / That itprodigious seemes in common people’s sight” (IV.i.13). Britomart is Apolloniansupernature, moon and sun, cold and hot. She is Virgin and Lion, summertimeconstellations shot with sparkling meteor showers. People look up and marvel.But they are seeing Babylonian and not Christian gods.This kind of glittering feminine beauty in Spenser always has a masculinecomponent. Tasso’s Amazon, the warrior Clorinda, never gives off the Apollonianlight of The Faerie Queene, but there are precedents for the above passages inAriosto. What Spenser adds to Ariosto is the quality of strangeness, of uncannyhierarchical excitation. Spenser senses the conceptualism and hieraticism in theaggressive western eye. He pushes vision into forbidden celestial space.Seraphic light unnerves and paralyzes the mortal viewer. Lascivious Malecasta,stealing upon sleeping Britomart, shrieks in fear. Her household finds herswooning at the feet of the wrathful knight:  they saw the warlike MaidAll in her snow-white smocke, with locks unbownd,Threatning the point of her avenging blade.Wherewith enrag’d she fiercely at them flew,And with her flaming sword about her layd. [III.i.63, 66]Britomart, affronted chastity, is a pillar of fire. She is the archangel atEden’s gate, driving off sin from her holy sequestered self, a virgin circle.Belphoebe similarly recoils from the lustful advances of Braggadocchio, aChaucerian lunk: “With that she swarving backe, her Javelin bright / Against himbent, and fiercely did menace” (II.iii.42). Spenser’s female androgynes ofApollonian radiance assert their self-preserving masculine will by explosiveextrusions of phallic projectiles. These javelins, swords, and darts arecontained in western light. They are solar beams, killing glances of ouromnipotent eye.Britomart is motherless, like Athena, Atalanta, and Camilla. We hear only of aroyal father and an old nurse, Glauce. There is a peculiarly physical scenebetween Britomart and the nurse, who revives her from love-sickness caused by aglimpse of her future betrothed in a crystal ball. Glauce rubs her charge allover the body and kisses her eyes and “alabaster brest” (III.ii.34, 42). Theseintimacies are maternal and then some. Spenser habitually complicates eveninnocent exchanges by some eroticizing adjective, usually describing invitingwhite flesh. Britomart’s relation with Glauce corresponds to Rosalind andCelia’s childhood union in Shakespeare’s As You Like It, a proto-lesbianism, theprepubescent female matrix from which the sexually ambiguous heroine emergesinto heterosexuality.A lesbian suggestiveness of a different kind occurs in the prior canto in CastleJoyeous, where Malecasta, thinking Britomart a man, is consumed by desire.“Panting soft, and trembling every joint,” she prowls the corridors likeDiderot’s obsessed lesbian mother superior and finally takes the masculineinitiative by invading Britomart’s bed (i.60). Malecasta has only seenBritomart’s face through her open visor—a face we know to be quite feminine;hence her attraction to Britomart is subtly homoerotic. This is clear when onecompares the episode to its source in Ariosto, where the Princess Fiordispinafalls in love with the female warrior Bradamante. The tone is completelydifferent. Fiordispina’s impossible plight has an affecting pathos; there isnothing decadent about it. Malecasta is a jaded sophisticate and chatelaine, notan ingenue. Her sexual aggressiveness turns things kinky, a word that applies toSpenser but never to Ariosto. Kinky is a mental twist, top-spin on the eyeball.Malecasta’s “wanton eyes” that “roll too lightly” are hostile western perceptionon the loose (41).Though Britomart, feeling an intruder under the covers, leaps up outraged,Spenser persists in putting her in compromising quasi-lesbian situations. Latershe kisses, embraces, and sleeps with Amoret, Belphoebe’s feminine sister.Refusing to accept the False Florimell as her paramour, Britomart treats “herowne Amoret” as if she were actually Amoret’s male champion (IV.v.20). Indeed,before Amoret knows her identity, the distracted Britomart pursues her maleimpersonation beyond the strictly necessary. Amoret becomes fearful ofBritomart’s “doubtfull” behavior, a lovemaking and “lustfulnesse” that threaten“some excesse” (IV.i.7).These homosexual touches are part of Spenser’s grand plan for Britomart. Hercharacter has extraordinary amplitude, covering the full range of humanexperience, from masculine achievement to maternal generation. Britomart is oneof the sexually most complex women in literature. Like Belphoebe, she is adazzling Apollonian androgyne, with the figure of an adolescent boy. But unlikeBelphoebe, she will renounce athleticism and militancy for motherhood. Even herinspired name is one of the Cretan titles of the Great Mother (Britomartis) andnot, as one first thinks, Spenser’s fusion of “British” and “martial.” One ofBritomart’s missions, peculiar in a supposedly Christian poem, is her pilgrimageto the shrine of Isis. There she has “a wondrous vision” where she is robed andmitred as a male priest, then transformed into the pregnant goddess (V.vii).This sex change, paralleling the finale of As You Like It, is Britomart’s lifepattern. She traverses the vast landscape of sexual personae, progressing fromsolitary knightly quester to obedient wife and mother.Britomart’s encounters with her future mate are full of comic ironies. Artegall,to whom she must cede sovereignty in marriage, is repeatedly crushed by her inhand-to-hand combat. The Faerie Queene follows Artegall’s education andtraining. He must earn his wife. At the moment, he falls dismally short ofBritomart’s daydreams, where he is “wise, warlike, personable, curteous, andkind” (III.iv.5). He enters the poem in an untidy state of rude strength, hisarmour covered with moss and weeds. His steed has oak leaves for trappings. Themotto on his ragged shield is “Salvagesse sans finesse,” savagery withoutrefinement (IV.iv.39). Artegall must be tempered from this extreme of brutishmasculinity to become more androgynous. Spenser’s letter to Sir Walter Raleighsays of Prince Arthur that the poem will “fashion a gentleman or noble person invirtuous and gentle discipline.” Spenser praises Sir Calidore, hero of the Bookof Courtesy, for his “gentlenesse of spright and manners mylde” (VI.i.2).Castiglione, we recall, gives the ideal Courtier “a special sweetness” and“grace.” The accomplished gentleman has a feminine sensitivity to the socialmoment. Good manners are tentative and accommodating. The man passing frombattlefield to court must be devirilized.In journeying toward his feminine pole, however, Artegall goes too far. Fallingbeneath the sway of Radigund, the Amazon queen, he becomes effeminate. WithRadigund, that strange glittering light returns to the poem after an absence ofa book and a half. It is the radiance of the Spenserian androgynous. Under hercoat of mail, Radigund wears a purple silk tunic woven with silver and quiltedon milk-white satin. She has painted buskins “basted with bends of gold.” Herscimitar hangs from an embroidered belt, and her jewelled shield shines like themoon (V.v.2–3). The description deliberately recalls Belphoebe. But Radigund,“halfe like a man,” is a bully. In her solitary self-communing, Belphoebe doesnot affront the freedom of others. Radigund is a new Omphale, dressing captiveknights in women’s clothes and making them sew and wash to earn their supper(V.iv.36, 31).Artegall makes two errors of judgment. First he promises, if defeated, to obeyRadigund’s law (Britomart later refuses to agree to such terms). Second, afterhe knocks Radigund cold, he is undone by her beauty, like Achilles overPenthesilea, and rashly flings away his sword. Thus he emasculates himself: “Sowas he overcome, not overcome, / But to her yeelded of his owne accord”(V.v.17). Radigund breaks Artegall’s sword as a symbol of castration and hustleshim into drag. “So hard it is to be a woman’s slave,” Spenser remarks, warningthat all women except queens were born to obey men (V.v.23, 25). The great chainof being governs Spenser’s definition of sexual order, perfected in marriage. Inthe Book of Justice, Artegall offends that principle by upsetting the sexualbalance of power. The Renaissance thought men’s political supremacy over womenwas based in natural law.Britomart rides to the rescue. She must restore Artegall to manhood in order,paradoxically, to surrender to him. Chivalric sex roles are reversed. Britomartis the white knight and Artegall the damsel in distress. Catching sight of herintended in female dress, Britomart turns her head aside in embarrassment.Challenging Radigund to combat, she suffers a shock. For the first and only timein the poem, she loses. It takes one hermaphrodite to beat another. We see acontest between two womanly androgynies, as if to prove the truer or highertype. Britomart, who significantly has just come from Isis’ Church, where shesurveyed her maternal future, recovers and kills the Amazon outright. Shedestroys Radigund’s revolutionary kingdom, repealing “the liberty of women” andrestoring them to “men’s subjection” (V.vii.42).As the end of As You Like It also demonstrates, the Renaissance, despite itshumanistic expansion of the rights of women, could not permit Amazonism toflourish within the social world. But Spenser’s sexual personae play mischiefwith his official doctrine. Britomart has more force and common sense than herhusband-to-be. She, not Artegall, is Spenser’s epic hero. Britomart carries theblood of noble Trojan refugees, which will pass from her into the royal Britishline to raise the third Troy of Elizabethan London. Thus she is the real Aeneasof the poem. I elsewhere note her other sexual ambiguities.10[ch25_notes.html#ch06note10a]Britomart’s martial superiority is no modern freak. Spenser laments its presentrarity. Long ago, in “Antique glory,” women fought battles and inspired poets toverse. Let great female deeds awake again, he proclaims (III.iv.1–2). In TheFaerie Queene, helpless, retiring femininity is a spiritually deficient persona.Fleeing, ever-receding Florimell, brainwashed by the literary conventions of thelove-game, is a caricature of hysterical vulnerability. Terrified by the soundof leaves, she runs even from admirers and rescuers. Spenser values courage andconfrontation. Florimell’s timidity and irrational fear are a defect of will.Belphoebe and Britomart’s arms signify readiness to engage in spiritual combat.For male and female alike in The Faerie Queene, the psychological energy ofaspiration and achievement is masculine. Life is rigor; no rest is possible.Seductive Phaedria tries to dissuade her suitor knights from conflict, but it isonly by the clashing strife of contraries that Temperance or the temperategolden mean is achieved. The Faerie Queene’s androgyny theme belongs to thisclassical tradition of the coincidentia oppositorum or fruitful synthesis ofopposites.Female arms and armour are the panoply of sex war. One of the cardinal events ofThe Faerie Queene is rape, which occurs in dozens of forms, some real, somefabricated. The maidens Una, Belphoebe, Florimell, Amoret, Samient, and Serenaare attacked once or repeatedly by rapists. Children born of rape include thesorcerer Merlin, the knights Satyrane and Marinell, and the chivalric tripletsTriamond, Priamond, and Diamond. Males too fall victim to rape, kidnapped by thegiantess Argante, her brother Ollyphant, and Jove himself. Even avarice isimagined as rape, the sacrilegious wounding of earth’s “quiet wombe” fortinselly silver and gold (II.vii.17). The rape cycle of The Faerie Queene is themost advanced rhetorical structure in Renaissance poetry, surpassed only byMilton’s freezing of epic plot into oratory in Paradise Lost. The masculinehurls itself at the feminine in an eternal circle of pursuit and flight.The rapes of The Faerie Queene come from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the most imitatedbook of the Renaissance. But rape in Ovid, as in Hellenistic and Baroque art, isa bit of a jamboree, a romp of popping male muscles and bursting female globes.Spenser intellectualizes the Ovidian motif. Rape is his metaphor for biology,for the surges of aggression in nature. The sex war of The Faerie Queene is aDarwinian spectacle of nature red in tooth and claw, of the eaters and theeaten. Bestial Lust and his agents, like the hyena monster stalking Florimell,literally feed on women’s flesh, devouring their bodies. Woman is meat, and thepenis, symbolized in oak logs brandished by Lust and Orgoglio, is a thing, aweapon. The theme culminates in Book Six, where Serena is stripped andappreciatively manhandled by slavering cannibals and where Pastorella, lustedafter by brigands, is embraced and entangled in a heap of corpses, the grosstriumph of matter.The rabid struggle for sexual dominance in The Faerie Queene is love debased tothe will-to-power. Christian ethics are assailed on every side by paganinstinct. Spenser is the first to sense the identity of sex and power, thepermeation of eroticism by aggression. Here he looks forward to Blake, Sade,Nietzsche, and Freud. Lust is the medium by which each sex tries to enslave theother. Spenser personifies it in numerous forms: as Lechery riding a goat in theprocession of vices; as Sansloy, the lawless knight; as enemies of Temperancebesieging the sense of touch; and as the grotesque predator Lust, all fangs,nose, and pouchy ears, a walking phallic symbol. As a state into which thevirtuous characters may fall, lust is allegorically projected as a series offelons, cads, and sybarites who use force, fraud, or magic to have their way.The Spenserian rapist is a savage, churl, or knight who is not “curteous” or“gentle,” who has not, in other words, undergone the feminizing refinement ofsocial life. Due to his failure to incorporate a feminine component, he pursuesfleeing, malleable femininity with a headlong ferocity that is a hunger forself-completion. His lust is a semantic error, a self-misinterpretation, aconfession of psychic inadequacy. But on the other hand, weakness inspiresattack. Vulnerability generates its own entrapments, creating a maelstrom ofvoracity around itself. Nature abhors a vacuum. Into the spiritual emptiness ofpure femininity in Spenser rush a storm of masculine forces. Florimell, forexample, is a professional victim. In her mad flight, she is called a “Hynd,”the deer whom fierce Belphoebe pursues at her first entrance. Florimell’s narrowescapes from disaster are sheer melodrama; they are not self-won or spirituallypaid for. She remains novice and ward, living off the dole.In The Faerie Queene, the ability to fend off rape is a prerequisite of theideal female psyche. We saw how spectacularly Belphoebe and Britomart turn theirweapons against lechers male and female. Amoret’s inability to defend herselfshows she is incomplete. Assaulted by Lust, she shrieks, in a striking displayof lack of animal energy, too “feebly” to wake the sleeping Britomart(IV.vii.4). And Amoret is grotesquely defenseless against the sorcerer Busyrane,who binds her to a pillar, slashes open her naked breast, and extracts from“that wide orifice her trembling heart,” laying it in a silver basin(III.xii.20–21). This episode, one of the most decadent in The Faerie Queene, isa formal spectacle of eroticized masochism. The genital symbolism is lurid andunconcealed. Spenser intensifies the moral ambiguity by using a poetry sodeliciously beautiful that the reader is attracted to and emotionally implicatedin Busyrane’s sadism. Ivory, gold, silver, “skin all snowy cleene” dyed“sanguine red”; fainting tremors, despoiling hands. Amoret, due to her spirituallimitations, may have invoked this morbid scene of martyrdom as an imaginativeprojection. But the gravest seduction is of our own sensibilities. Spenser,making exquisite aestheticism out of torture and rape, arouses us through theaggressive pagan eye. Amoret’s “wide wound” is her passivity but our probing anddelectation. Western sex as mental surgery.Feminine and unarmed, Florimell and Amoret are flagrant targets for attack.Sadism and masochism engender one another in dizzy oscillation. Caught on theswing of the sexual dialectic, the rapist vainly strives to obliterate hisopposite. The Faerie Queene’s savage circular world of rape is transcended bythe higher characters, who internally subsume the chastened extremes ofmasculine and feminine. Florimell’s unmixed femininity makes her unfit forquest. It is her impoverished lack of sexual complexity that allows a knock-offcopy of her to be so easily fabricated. The witch-hag makes a “snowy” FalseFlorimell and animates it with an epicene, possibly homosexual evil spiritskilled in female impersonation (III.viii.8). Because of her psychologicallyembryonic state, Florimell’s identity is quickly invaded and occupied by adaemonic hermaphrodite. This too is the knife of Busyrane, the sensualself-wounding of femininity. Spenser’s naive rape victims turn up again inColeridge’s Christabel, one of the nineteenth century’s most influential poems.And they are everywhere in that autoerotic sadist, Emily Dickinson. Neither ofthese far-reaching effects of Spenserian sex crime has been noted before.I have been speaking of assaults of male on female. But some of The FaerieQueene’s boldest sexual aggressors are the licentious femmes fatales: genitallydeformed Duessa (a version of the Whore of Babylon), Acrasia, Phaedria,Malecasta, Hellenore. Manipulative and exploitative, they seek humiliatingsexual victory over men. Their greatest power is in womblike closed spaces, inbedchambers, groves, and caves like the leafy grotto of Homer’s Calypso, wherethe male is captured, seduced, and infantilized. Spenser’s great word for suchplaces is “bower,” both garden and burrow. Embowerment is one of The FaerieQueene’s primary processes, a psychological convolution of entrancement, turningthe linearity of quest into the uroboros of solipsism.The Bower of Bliss, wrathfully destroyed by Sir Guyon, is the most lavishlydepicted of these female zones, which express the invitation and yet archetypaldanger of sex. At the gate, Excess, a “comely dame” in disordered clothes,crushes scrotal grape clusters (a Dionysiac symbol) into a vaginal cup of gold,the male squeezed dry for female pleasure (II.xii.55–56). At the damp heart ofthe dusky Bower lies Acrasia, hungrily hovering over the dozing knight Verdant,who sprawls enervated and depleted, his weapons abandoned and defaced. Acrasiais a Circean sorceress and vampire: she “through his humid eyes did sucke hisspright” (73). This sultry postcoital scene is based on Botticelli’s Venus andMars, whose long narrow design signifies the triumph of mother nature’shorizontals over the verticals of spiritual ascent (fig. 30[ch06.html#ch06fig30]).Spenser’s femmes fatales tempt their male victims and paramours away from thepursuit of chivalric honor into “lewd sloth”—languid indolence and passivity(III.v.1) The Faerie Queene represents this moral degeneration as dissolution ofApollonian contour. Sinister fogs blanket the landscape, a Dionysian miasma.Lying down to rest in pretty glades, Spenser’s knights feel their strengthflowing away. In The Faerie Queene, the hard Botticellian edge of heroic malewill is constantly fighting off the blurring of female sfumato. Spenser is theanatomist of an economy of sex, of physiological laws of pressure and control,embodied in images of binding and loosing. The Bower of Bliss is the chthonianswamp, the matrix of liquid nature. It is inert and opaque, slippery withonanistic spillage. The bower is an erotic capsulization, a pocketing of theeye. Apollo’s chariot is mired in Dionysian deliquescence. Images shimmer in ourself-generated heat. The Spenserian bower is our libidinous mother-born body,matriarchal property in perpetuity. The rule of The Faerie Queene is: keepmoving and stay out of the shade. The penalty is embowerment, sterileself-thwarting, a limbo of lush pleasures but stultifying passivity.Image [../images/f0188-01.jpg]30. Sandro Botticelli, Venus and Mars, 1485–86.The Faerie Queene is the most extended and extensive meditation on sex in thehistory of poetry. It charts the entire erotic spectrum, a great chain of beingrising from matter to spirit, from the coarsest lust to chastity and romanticidealism. The poem’s themes of sex and politics are parallel: the psyche, likesociety, must be disciplined by good government. Spenser agrees with classicaland Christian philosophers on the primacy of reason over animal appetite. Helooks forward to the Romantic poets, however, in the way that he shows the seximpulse as innately daemonic and barbaric, breeding witches and sorcerers ofevil allure. Like the Odyssey, The Faerie Queene is a heroic epic in which themasculine must evade female traps or delays. But two millennia of rising andfalling urban culture intervene since Homer. Spenser ponders how love isaffected by worldly manners, how it is embellished or distorted by theartificiality of courts. Hence sex in The Faerie Queene reaches extremes ofdecadent sophistication not present in literature since Roman satire and neverin the genre of epic. Marriage is the social regulation and placement of sexualenergies, which for Spenser otherwise fall back into the anarchy of nature,ruled by the will-to-power and survival of the fittest. Marriage is thesanctified link between nature and society. Sex in Spenser must always have asocial goal.Spenser’s theory of sex is a continuum from the normative to the aberrant.Chastity and fruitful marriage occupy one pole, after which the modalities oferoticism darken toward the perverse and monstrous. First in blame is what wewould call recreational sex, heterosexual impulses hedonistically squandered. Ielsewhere enumerate incidences of other illicit practices, which make The FaerieQueene an encyclopedic catalog of perversions, like Krafft-Ebing’s PsychopathiaSexualis: not only rape and homosexuality but priapism, nymphomania,exhibitionism, incest, bestiality, necrophilia, fetishism, transvestism, andtranssexualism.11 [ch25_notes.html#ch06note11a] Above all is a recurrent motifof sadomasochistic sexual bondage. Captivity and enslavement, chains and snares,love as a sickness or wound: Spenser diagnoses these Petrarchan stereotypes asthemselves diseased. Literary convention led lovers to confuse sex withself-immolation. Love was corrupted by Freud’s death-instinct.Sexual bondage in The Faerie Queene belongs to the larger theme of politics.Hierarchy and ceremony, radiations of the great chain of being and masterprinciples of Renaissance culture, are criminalized in the sexual realm. Bondageis a daemonic antimasque, the uncontrolled sexual fantasy of morallysecessionist authoritarians. Another pathological category is flight from sex,either sexual fear or frigidity, which Spenser incorporates in a theory ofnarcissism that is psychoanalytically pioneering. Dainty self-withholding turnsinto autoeroticism, a stagnant psychic pool. Personality becomes a prison. Onher throne in the House of Pride, Lucifera raptly gazes at herself in ahand-mirror, “And in her selfe-lov’d semblance tooke delight.” (I.iv.10). In herrudderless boat, Phaedria eerily laughs and sings to herself, “Making sweetsolace to her selfe alone” (II.vi.3). Narcissism is “idleness,” a big word inSpenser. In self-love there is no energy of duality and therefore no spiritualprogression. Autoeroticism, self-abuse literally and figuratively, inhibits theenlargement and multiplication of emotion in marriage and therefore theinvestment of psychic energy in the public structures of history.Voyeurism or scopophilia is one of the most characteristic moods of The FaerieQueene. An observer is posted by chance or choice at the perimeter of avoluptuous sexual scene, to which he plays peeping Tom. Voyeuristic elements arepresent in the episodes of Phedon and Philemon, where a squire is made to watcha sexual charade defaming his bride (II.iv.). They are rampant in the Bower ofBliss, where Cymochles peruses a bevy of half-naked damsels, ogling them throughdeceptively half-closed lids; where bathing lady wrestlers expose themselves tothe distinctly interested Guyon; and where flimsily clad Acrasia fastens “herfalse eyes” on drowsy Verdant, a scene repeated in the tapestry of Venus andAdonis in Castle Joyous (II.v.32–34, xii.73; III.i.34–37). At Malbecco’sbanquet, Hellenore and Paridell arouse each other by brazen eye contact and alewd sexual theater of spilled wine, a voyeurism to resurface in their host’splight as a hidden spectator at the debauchment of his wife, who is pleasurablymounted by a satyr nine times in one night (III.ix, x). Sleeping Serena isinspected by a tribe of cannibals, who seat themselves like an audience andjudiciously weigh the merits of each appetizing part of her body (VI.viii). OnMount Acidale, Sir Calidore stumbles on the dazzling scene of a hundred nakedmaidens dancing in a ring, Spenser’s supreme symbol for the harmony of natureand art (VI.x). In the Cantos of Mutabilitie, Faunus is punished for witnessingDiana at her bath (VII.vi.42–55). Cumulatively, these episodes in Spenser surelyinspired the voyeuristic spying of Milton’s Satan on Adam and Eve in the Gardenof Eden, a detail not in the Bible (P.L. IV, IX).The voyeurism of The Faerie Queene, endangering the poem itself, arises from theproblem of sensuous beauty, which can lead the soul toward good or evil. C. S.Lewis was the first to apply the term “skeptophilia” (his spelling) to Spenser’sBower of Bliss, but criticism did not follow it up.12[ch25_notes.html#ch06note12a] G. Wilson Knight rightly calls the poem“perilously near decadence”: The Faerie Queene is itself one vast Bower ofBliss.”13 [ch25_notes.html#ch06note13a] I would go even further: the poeticallystrongest and most fully realized material in The Faerie Queene is pornographic.Spenser, like Blake’s Milton, may be of the devil’s party without knowing it. Ina paradox cherished by Sade and Baudelaire, the presence of moral law or taboointensifies the pleasure of sexual transgression and the luxury of evil. A greatpoet always has profound ambivalences and obscurities of motivation, whichcriticism has scarcely begun to study in this case.The Faerie Queene is didactic but also self-pleasuring. In the midst ofdissipation and atrocity, we hear a voice saying “Ain’t it awful!” Scholarship’smajor error, incredible in this century of the New Critical doctrine of persona,has been to identify that voice with the poet. The Faerie Queene iscontrapuntal. There is an ethical voice and a wanton voice, dissolving the otherinto lust by its delicacy and splendor, its hypnotic appeals to the untamedpagan eye. Voyeurism is the relation of this poet to this poem. It is therelation of every reader to every novel, of every spectator to every painting,play, and film. It is present in our study of biography and history, and even inour conversations about others.Voyeurism is the amoral aesthetic of the aggressive western eye. It is the cloudof contemplation that enwraps us as sexual personae, transporting us unseenacross space and time. Christianity, far from putting out the pagan eye, merelyexpanded its power. Christianity’s vast tracts of the forbidden are virginterritory for the pagan eye to penetrate and defile. The Faerie Queene is amassively original analysis of these tensions in western culture. Criticismassumes that what Spenser says is what he means. But a poet is not always masterof his own poem, for imagination can overwhelm moral intention. This is whathappens in Coleridge’s Christabel. But I think Spenser far more cunning andconscious of his teasing ambiguities. His favorite erotic trope is half-revealedwhite female flesh, glimpsed through ripped or parted garments. The FaerieQueene often becomes what it condemns, nowhere more overtly than in itsvoyeurism, in which both poet and reader are deeply implicated.The Faerie Queene’s decadent aesthetics reflect the Apollonian hierarchism ofthe Renaissance court world. Spenserian pornography is always sexual spectacle,a ceremonial tableau or procession. Formality creates perversity. Before Amoretslashed by Busyrane, there is the suicide Amavia, whom Guyon findsstill-conscious with a knife in her riven “white alabaster brest.” “Purple gore”stains her garments, the “grassy ground” and “cleane waves” of a bubblingfountain, and finally the cruelly playing hands of “a lovely babe.” Beside heris the corpse of the knight Mortdant, bloody but smiling and, according to thepoem, still sexually irresistible (II.i.39–41). Proud Mirabella, havingtormented her admirers and laughed at their sufferings and death, is nowpunished by being whipped along by Scorn, who laughs in turn at her cries(VI.vii). Artegall finds a headless lady, murdered by her knight Sir Sanglier,who is now forced to carry her dead head as a penalty (V.i). The iron man,Talus, chops off and nails up the gold hands and silver feet of beautiful Muneraor self-worshipping money (V.ii). As in Michelangelo’s “Captives” and ignudi,allegory has gone to hell.Such combinations in Spenser of beauty, laughter, sex, torture, mutilation, anddeath are emotionally startling and ethically problematic. I find but oneprecedent: Boccaccio’s tale of Nastagio degli Onesti in the Decameron. A haughtywoman rejects and gloats over her suffering lover, who commits suicide. Foreternity, they are condemned to pursuit and flight. Whenever he catches her, hekills her. He slits her back, tears out her “hard, cold heart,” and feeds it andher entrails to dogs. Then she springs to life, and the chase resumes. Nastagio,courting his own proud maiden, lays a banquet in a pine grove, so that theguests and his callous beloved may witness “the massacre of the cruel lady.”14[ch25_notes.html#ch06note14a] Bon appétit! Botticelli’s workshop painted thissavage, salacious tale, presumably to his design. A black knight on a blacksteed waves his rapier at a nude woman, who in weirdly conflated scenes runsthrough the forest and lies on her face, her back being sliced open. A secondpanel shows the festive banqueters witnessing the bloody capture, as the lady’swhite buttock and thigh are seized at table height by toothy mastiffs. TheSpenserian decadence in Boccaccio’s tale is produced by the coolness andcasualness of the detached eye, which treats sex and violence like art. Eye andobject are positioned precisely as in modern cinema.Spenserian cinema is ritualized sexual perception. We feel the poet’s ownconnoisseurship everywhere in The Faerie Queene. It is probably the source ofthe erotic overtones in Glauce’s bedroom massage of Britomart and in PrincessClaribell’s bizarre reunion with her long-lost Pastorella, where mother jumpsdaughter and rips her bodice open (Vl.xii.19). Connoisseurship, as we will seein nineteenth-century aestheticism and Decadence, is the dominance of theintellectualized eye. The Faerie Queene is like a stunt film substituting asatirical soundtrack for the real one. A sermonizing voice earnestly comments ondisturbing or pornographic images. But the eye in Spenser always wins.The Faerie Queene is pulled in two directions, one Protestant, one pagan.Spenser wants good to come out of noble action. But sexual personae have a willof their own. The spectral sex signs of western art are vaunting creatures ofhostility and egotism. The Faerie Queene’s harsh clangor of combat is our nativemusic. Spenser’s contradictions are uneasiest in his nature theory. He glorifieswoman, but her body is a morass in which action is lost. Spenser is poetry’sfirst master of daemonic image. The ambivalent bower theme that he bequeathed tohis successors would make English literature supreme. It makes all thedifference, for example, between Rousseau and Wordsworth. Spenser asks offertile nature, should we resist or yield to it? The Faerie Queene opposes thearmoured to the embowered woman. Spenser’s myth of benevolent fertility ties himto Keats. But in his broodings upon the secrets of nature, paralleled in theRenaissance only by Leonardo, he is disquieted and indecisive. His Gardens ofAdonis, a creative womb-world with female mount and odorous dripping boughs, areanother male prison.Britomart’s shiny armour and Belphoebe’s Byzantine glitter are attempts topolish and perfect the eye and keep it free. Spenser longs for an Apollonianwoman. To make everything visible: we saw that ambition in homosexual Greekclassicism. The long cinematic sightlines of The Faerie Queene create a clear,articulate pagan space. Spenser turns medieval allegory into pagan ostentation.Scheduled moral meanings barely survive this apotheosis of the pagan eye.Spenser’s pictorialism is a compulsive Apollonian thing-making. And the mostglamourous of these made things is the female warrior, who combats fallennature, where the vampire drains maleness and the rapist annihilates femaleness.Spenser’s aristocratic Amazons, Belphoebe and Britomart, renouncing dominance inthe boudoir and masochistic vulnerability in the field, carry the western eye toApollonian victory."},{"pageContent":"7SHAKESPEARE AND DIONYSUSAs You Like It and Antony and CleopatraSpenser’s initial heavy impact upon English literature was in the 1590s, justwhen Shakespeare was developing his style. Shakespeare’s two early long poems,Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece (1592, 1593–94) are homages to Spenser.The first is about sensual embowerment in female nature, its legend of dominantgoddess and kidnapped pretty boy borrowed straight from The Faerie Queene. Thesecond is a lurid account of a politically pivotal rape from early Romanhistory. Shakespeare slows down the sexual cinema of Spenser’s rape cycle to anarousing frame-by-frame inspection of the assailant’s invasion of bedroom, bed,and white body. Spenser’s sophisticated amalgam of prurience and moralism isadroitly duplicated. But Shakespeare had to throw off Spenser in order to get onwith his own creative mission. His struggle against Spenser produced, I wouldargue, the titanism of the greatest plays, in which Shakespeare pushes into newground beyond Spenser’s reach. I see Titus Andronicus (1592–94), long thoughtShakespeare’s weakest play, as a devastating parody of Spenser. It has usuallybeen misread (though not by A. C. Hamilton) as slipshod bad taste. But thisRoman drama of rape and mutilation turns the Spenserian rape cycle intoslapstick comedy. It is hilariously, intentionally funny. The ravished Laviniadoggedly persists in waving her “stumps” about like a windmill. Like Wilde’sApollonian The Importance of Being Earnest, Titus Andronicus should be played byromping drag queens, so that its outrageous mannerisms clearly emerge. This playis Shakespeare’s taunting farewell to Spenser. He is about to launch his ownoriginal explorations of love and gender. In Titus Andronicus Shakespeare triesto fix and reduce Spenser, in order to pin him down and get past him. Lavinia’sendlessly stressed amputated tongue and hands are Atalanta’s balls, blood-redherrings tossed along the racetrack of the Muses.Spenser is an iconicist, Shakespeare a dramaturge. Spenser is ruled by the eye,Shakespeare by the ear. Spenser is an Apollonian, presenting his personae in alinear series of epiphanies, carved out by the Botticellian hard edge. He makestableaux, episodic vignettes, so loosely connected by plot that no one can everremember what happens when. I see The Faerie Queene’s processional technique ofshort dramatic tableaux of high-colored sexual personae repeated in D. H.Lawrence’s Women in Love, with its overt Apollonian-Dionysian theme. Shakespeareis a metamorphosist and therefore closer to Dionysus than to Apollo. He showsprocess, not objects. Everything is in flux—thought, language, identity, action.He enormously expands the inner life of his personae and sets them into the hugefateful rhythm which is his plot, an overwhelming force entering the play frombeyond society. Shakespeare’s elemental energy comes from nature itself. I thinkthis remark by G. Wilson Knight the most brilliant thing ever said aboutShakespeare’s plays: “In such poetry we are aware less of any surface than of aturbulent power, a heave and swell, from deeps beyond verbal definition; and, asthe thing progresses, a gathering of power, a ninth wave of passion, an increasein tempo and intensity.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note1a] The sea, Dionysian liquidnature, is the master image in Shakespeare’s plays. It is the wave-motion withinShakespearean speech which transfixes the audience even when we don’t understanda word of it.Spenser’s medieval language is archaic, backward-looking. By reversingcontemporary changes in language, he means to halt the giddy changes inRenaissance personae. His Apollonian personalities are historically retrograde.Epic is always a genre of nostalgia. Spenser, like Vergil, turns to epic at amoment of sudden anarchic multiplication of sexual personae. We will see Blakesimilarly responding to the psychological crisis which is Romanticism.Multiplicity of persona, random role-experimentation, is always evil in TheFaerie Queene. Positive Spenserian hermaphroditism is never fluid andimprovisational, as it is in Shakespeare, but rather formalized, frozen, andemblematic, as in Britomart’s phallic spear or the Isis idol’s “long whiteslender wand” (V.vii.7). Shakespeare responds to Spenser’s archaism with dynamicfuturism. The sixteenth century transformed Middle English into modern English.Grammar was up for grabs. People made up vocabulary and syntax as they wentalong. Not until the eighteenth century would rules of English usage appear.Shakespearean language is a bizarre super-tongue, alien and plastic, twisting,turning, and forever escaping. It is untranslatable, since it knocks Anglo-Saxonroot words against Norman and Greco-Roman importations sweetly or harshly,kicking us up and down rhetorical levels with witty abruptness. No one in reallife ever spoke like Shakespeare’s characters. His language does not “makesense,” especially in the greatest plays. Anywhere from a third to a half ofevery Shakespearean play, I conservatively estimate, will always remain under aninterpretative cloud. Unfortunately, this fact is obscured by the encrustationsof footnotes in modern texts, which imply to the poor cowed student that if onlyhe knew what the savants do, all would be clear as day. Every time I openHamlet, I am stunned by its hostile virtuosity, its elusiveness andimpenetrability. Shakespeare uses language to darken. He mesmerizes bydisorienting us. He suspends the traditional compass-points of rhetoric, stillquite firm in Marlowe, normally regarded as Shakespeare’s main influence.Shakespeare’s words have “aura.” This he got from Spenser, not Marlowe.Spenser’s daemonic imagery turns into turmoil and hallucination in Shakespeare.Shakespeare’s language hovers at the very threshold of dreaming. It is shaped bythe irrational. Shakespearean characters are controlled by rather thancontrolling their speech. They are like Michelangelo’s Mannerist sculptures,restive under night visitations. Consciousness in Shakespeare is soaked inprimal compulsion.Language and personae mirror each other in both Spenser and Shakespeare. Thearchaizing language of The Faerie Queene is analogous to the Apollonian unity ofits armoured personalities. Belphoebe and Britomart have one line of thought, asthey have one line of action. They are not besieged by fantasy or mood, by therising torrent of imagination surging through Shakespeare’s major characters.The cool, tensionless consistency of identity of Spenser’s godly Una (“Accepttherefore my simple selfe”; I.viii.27) appears in Shakespeare only in helplessmaidens like Ophelia, Cordelia, and Desdemona, who are destroyed by their plays.In Antony and Cleopatra, the Una-like Octavia comes off as a party-pooper andstick-in-the-mud compared to Shakespeare’s loquacious firebrand heroine.Octavia’s reticence and feminine whispers affront the genre of drama, which isall voice. But in The Faerie Queene, we saw, epiphanic Apollonian silence rules.Language is truncated or abbreviated for virtue’s sake. In Spenser, actionspeaks louder than words. Significantly, the decadent Bower of Bliss iscacophonous, a confusion of “birds, voices, instruments, winds, waters”(II.xii.70). This resembles Plutarch’s description of the wheelingnature-metamorphoses of Dionysus.That proteanism is evil in The Faerie Queene accounts for Spenser’s puzzlingportrayal of Proteus as a cruel tyrant and rapist.2 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note2a]Shakespeare, on the other hand, is proteanism personified. Coleridge calls him“the one Proteus of the fire and the flood.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note3a]Multiplicity of personae, afflicting Hamlet but magnifying Rosalind andCleopatra, is a major principle in his plays, just as multiplicity of languageis his poetic style. Voice is so primary in Shakespeare that costumes andtime-schemes may be radically altered, as they are in modern productions,without affecting the higher meanings of the drama. But strict authenticity ofcostume is crucial to Spenser’s iconistic personae. Put Belphoebe in a tennisdress or Regency chemise, and all is lost. Apollonian armature is not therotating wheel of fashion. It is hard and eternal. In Spenser, I showed,chastity is integrity of form. But Shakespeare’s characters are forever changingtheir clothes, especially in the comedies. Shakespeare takes the inherited themeof mistaken identity, as old as Menander and Plautus, and turns it into ameditation on Renaissance role-playing. He is the first to reflect upon thefluid nature of modern gender and identity.Accordingly, Shakespeare is impatient with objets d’art, unlike the eye-obsessedpictorialist, Spenser. We see this as early as Venus and Adonis, whereShakespeare’s goddess speaks of sullen Adonis as a “lifeless picture, cold andsenseless stone, / Well-painted idol, image dull and dead, / Statue contentingbut the eye alone” (211–13). Wherever art works appear in Shakespeare—Violagrieving like “Patience on a monument,” Octavia as “a statue rather than abreather,” Hermione as a statue brought to life—they are usually symptoms ofsome emotional lapse or deficiency, of the callous abandonment of good, usuallyby blameworthy males. Cold objectification is lofty in Spenser, but inShakespeare it is an obstruction to the free flow of psychic energy.Shakespeare’s resculptured rapee, Lavinia, may be the ultimate Spenserian mute.Shakespeare rejects Spenserian hieraticism. Stasis is a danger on stage, whereit slows the propulsiveness of dramatic plot. Every slighting reference to thevisual arts in Shakespeare is a pointed rebuke to Spenser. Spenserian aestheticsare cunningly evoked at odd moments, as in Macbeth’s gorgeous description of themurdered king, “his silver skin laced with his golden blood” (II.iii.112).Shakespeare puts Spenser’s glittering Byzantine iconicism into a traitor’smouth. The essence of Shakespeare is not the objet d’art but the metaphor.Metaphors are the key to character, the imaginative center of every speech. Theyspill from line to line, abundant, florid, illogical. They are Shakespeare’sdream-vehicle of Dionysian metamorphosis. The teeming metaphors are the objectsof the medieval great chain of being suddenly unstacked and released intovitalistic free movement. Shakespeare’s metaphors, like his sexual personae,flicker through a rolling stream of development and process. Nothing inShakespeare stays the same for long.If Spenser is a pictorialist, Shakespeare is an alchemist. In his treatment ofsex and personality, Shakespeare is a shape-shifter and master oftransformations. He returns dramatic impersonation to its ritual origins in thecult of Dionysus, where masks were magic. Shakespeare recognizes that westernidentity, in its long pagan line, is impersonation. Kenneth Burke calls role indrama “salvation via change or purification of identity (purification in eitherthe moral or chemical sense).”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note4a] The pattern ofchemical breakdown, remixture of elements, and composition of new personality isclear in King Lear, where the protagonist is set to the boil on a stormy heath.Alchemy, which began in Hellenistic Egypt, entered the Middle Ages throughArabic texts and remained influential throughout the Renaissance. Its esotericsymbolism was a matter of literate common knowledge down to the seventeenthcentury, when science took over its terms and techniques. There is debate abouthow much alchemical lore survived the Renaissance and was transmitted to thefounders of Romanticism. That Coleridge was influenced by German commentary onthe subject seems certain.Alchemy, like astrology, has been stigmatized at its worst rather thanremembered at its best. It was not just a mercenary scrabble for a formula toturn lead to gold. It was a philosophical quest for the creative secrets ofnature. Mind and matter were linked, in the pagan way. Alchemy is pagannaturism. Titus Burckhardt says alchemy’s spiritual aim was “the achievement of‘inward silver’ or ‘inward gold’—in their immutable purity and luminosity.”5[ch25_notes.html#ch07note5a] Jung speaks of alchemy as not only “the mother ofchemistry” but “the forerunner of our modern psychology of the unconscious.”6[ch25_notes.html#ch07note6a] Jack Lindsay sees alchemy prefiguring allscientific and anthropological “concepts of development and evolution.”7[ch25_notes.html#ch07note7a] The alchemical process sought to transform theprima materia, or chaos of mutable substances, into the eternal andincorruptible “Philosopher’s Stone.” This perfected entity was depicted as anandrogyne, a rebis (“double thing”). Both the primal matrix and the finishedproduct were hermaphroditic, because they contained all four basic elements,earth, water, air, and fire. The self-contained magnum opus of alchemicalprocess was symbolized by the uroboros, the self-begetting, self-devouringserpent. The synthesis of contraries in the watery “bath” of the opus was ahierosgamos or coniunctio (“sacred marriage” or “union”), a “chymical wedding”of male and female. This pair appeared as brother and sister in incestuousintercourse. The terminology of incest is everywhere in alchemy, betraying itsimplicit pagan character. Romanticism’s incest themes may bear this ancienthistory.The alchemists gave the name “Mercurius” to an allegorical hermaphroditeconstituting all or part of the process. Mercurius, the god and planet, isliquid mercury or quicksilver, the elixir of transformations. Arthur EdwardWaite says, “Universal Mercury is the animating spirit diffused throughout theuniverse.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note8a] Mercurius is my name for one of themost fascinating and restless western sexual personae. We earlier traced theidea of the “mercurial” to crafty, wing-footed Hermes. My Mercurius, firstconceived by Shakespeare, is the androgynous spirit of impersonation, the livingembodiment of multiplicity of persona. Mercurius possesses verbal and thereforemental power. Shakespeare’s great Mercurius androgyne is the transvestiteRosalind and after her the male-willed Cleopatra. The main characteristic is anelectric wit, dazzling, triumphant, euphoric, combined with rapid alternationsof persona. Lesser examples are Goethe’s Mignon, Jane Austen’s Emma, andTolstoy’s Natasha. Lady Caroline Lamb, Byron’s tempestuous mistress, will be ourreal-life example of the negative or afflicted Mercurius. At their most stagyand manipulative, Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord in The Philadelphia Story andVivien Leigh as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind are the rivetingMercurius. Above all is Patrick Dennis’ breezy Auntie Mame, lavish practitionerof multiple personae, whose cult status among male homosexuals is theunmistakable sign of her cross-sexual character.Shakespeare is the most prolific single contributor to that parade of sexualpersonae which is western art. The liberated woman, I said, is the symbol of theEnglish Renaissance, as the beautiful boy is of the Italian. In Shakespeare,liberated woman speaks, irrepressibly. Wit, as Jacob Burckhardt suggests, is aconcomitant of the new “free personality” of the Renaissance.9[ch25_notes.html#ch07note9a] Western wit, culminating in Oscar Wilde, isaggressive and competitive. It is an aristocratic language of social maneuveringand sexual display. The English and the French jointly created this hard style,for which there are few parallels in the Far East, where cultivated humor tendsto be mild and diffuse. The Faerie Queene’s arms and armour turn into wit inShakespeare’s Renaissance Amazons. Rosalind, the young heroine of As You Like It(1599–1600), is one of the most original characters of Renaissance literature,capsulizing the era’s psychological changes. The play’s source is Thomas Lodge’sprose romance, Rosalynde or Euphues’ Golden Legacy (1590), which contains mostof the plot. But Shakespeare makes the story a fantasia upon westernpersonality. He enlarges and complicates Rosalind’s character by giving her wit,audacity, and masculine force. Rosalind is Shakespeare’s answer to Spenser’sBelphoebe and Britomart, whom he spins into verbal and psychological motion.Rosalind is kinetic rather than iconistic. She too is a virgin. Indeed, herexhilarating freshness depends on that virginity. But Shakespeare removesAmazonian virginity from its holy self-sequestration and puts it into socialengagement. Rosalind, unlike the high-minded Belphoebe and Britomart, has fun.She inhabits newly reclaimed secular space.In her transvestite adventure, Rosalind seems to resemble Viola of Shakespeare’sTwelfth Night, but temperamentally, the two women are completely unalike. In herauthority over the other characters, Rosalind surpasses all of Shakespeare’scomic heroines. Productions of As You Like It rarely show this. IntrepidRosalind is usually reduced to Viola, and both parts are marred by summer-camppastoral sentimentality. Rosalind’s whole meaning is lyricism of personalitywithout sentimentality. These roles, written for boy actors, have ambiguities oftone which modern actresses suppress. The androgynous Rosalind is prettified anddemasculinized. Shakespeare’s Portia is momentarily transvestite in The Merchantof Venice, where she wears a lawyer’s robe for one act. But Portia’s is not acomplete sexual persona; that is, the play’s other characters do not respond tohim/her erotically. Rosalind and Viola are sexual instigators, the cause ofirksome romantic errors. In many tales available to Shakespeare, a disguisedwoman inspires another woman’s unhappy love. Most such stories were Italian,influenced by classical models, like Ovid’s Iphis. The Italian tales, like theirEnglish prose counterparts, imitate the droll Ovidian manner of sexual innuendo.As You Like It and Twelfth Night depart from their sources in avoidingbedchamber intrigue. Shakespeare is interested in psychology, not pornography.Both Rosalind and Viola adopt male clothing in crisis, but Viola’s predicamentis grimmer. She is orphaned and shipwrecked. Rosalind, on the other hand,banished by her usurper uncle, elects a male persona as whim and escapade. Bothheroines choose sexually ambiguous alter egos. Viola is Cesario, a eunuch, andRosalind Ganymede (as in Lodge), the beautiful boy kidnapped by Zeus. Rosalindis brasher than Viola from the start, arming herself with swashbuckling cutlassand boarspear. Viola, with her frail court rapier, makes a girlish and delicateboy at best. She is timid and easily terrorized. Rosalind relishes trouble andeven creates it, as in her malicious meddling in the Sylvius-Phebe romance. WhenOlivia falls in love with her, Viola feels compassion toward this victim of hersexual illusion. But Rosalind is incapable of compassion where her own directinterest is not at stake. She can be hard, disdainful. Rosalind’s lack ofconventional feminine tenderness is part of her lofty power as a sexual persona.There is intimidation in her, uncaught by modern productions. Unlike Viola,Rosalind acts and conspires and laughs at the consequences.Twelfth Night’s plot resolution depends on the mechanistic device of twins.Viola surrenders her uncomfortable male role to a convenient brother, whouncomplainingly steps into her place in Olivia’s affections. As You Like It,however, is centered on the more ambiguous Rosalind, who subsumes both twinswithin her nature. Viola is melancholy, recessive, but Rosalind is exuberant andegotistical, with a flamboyant instinct for center stage. The difference isclearest at play’s end. Viola falls into long silence, keeping the joy ofreunion to herself. Her decorous self-removal is the opposite of Rosalind’slordly capture of the finale of As You Like It. Dominating her play better thanher father has dominated his own realm, Rosalind asserts her innate aristocraticauthority.Shakespeare rings his double-sexed heroines with rippling circles of sexualambiguity. Olivia’s infatuation with Viola/Cesario is as suspicious as that ofSpenser’s Malecasta with Britomart, for the disguised Viola strikes everyone asfeminine in voice and appearance. Twelfth Night begins with Duke Orsino savoringhis sexual submission to the indifferent Olivia, whom he describes with outmodedPetrarchan metaphors of coldness and cruelty. Since the narcissistic Orsino isof dubious masculinity, Viola’s ardor for him is problematic. In both TwelfthNight and As You Like It, the transvestite heroines fall for men far inferior tothem. Even feminine Viola has sexual peculiarities. L. G. Salingar says of Violaand her precursors in the play’s Roman and Italian sources, she is “the only oneto fall in love after assuming her disguise.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note10a] SoViola falls in love not as a woman but as an androgyne. That she senses andesteems Orsino’s half-feminine state is suggested in a covert confession of lovewhere she casts him fleetingly as a woman (II.iv.23–28). Conveying Orsino’smasochistic endearments to the arrogant Olivia, Viola is an androgyne bearing ahermaphroditic message from one androgyne to another. Violas transports Orsino’sresidual maleness before Olivia, where it radiates as an amatory promise seemingto come from Viola herself. Thus Viola’s official mission further masculinizesher. Richard Bernheimer speaks of personality as a vehicle of representation bydiplomats and attorneys: in “the fascination of his presence,” deputy mayeclipse employer.11 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note11a] The fetching Viola is aconflation of sexual representations. She represents Orsino but also, asCesario, she represents a male. Twelfth Night relativizes gender and identity bythis masque-like succession of representations. The principal characters becomeandrogynous echoes of one another.Like his counterpart in Twelfth Night, the male lead of As You Like It hassevere dramatic shortcomings. Orlando, with whom Rosalind instantly falls inlove, is adolescent-looking, barely bearded. Shakespeare undercuts his athleticprowess by making him the butt of constant jokes. The slow-witted Orlando is anunimpressive exponent of his sex in a play ruled by a vigorous heroine. BertrandEvans calls him “only a sturdy booby.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note12a] LikeOrsino, Orlando is more manipulated than manipulating. There may be a homoeroticelement in his prompt consent to Rosalind/Ganymede’s transsexual game. In As YouLike It, Shakespeare reduces the Renaissance prestige of male authority tomaximize his heroine’s princely potency. Rosalind is intellectually andemotionally superior, sweeping all the characters into her sexual orbit. Thereis a lesbian suggestiveness in Phebe’s infatuation with the disguised Rosalind,whose prettiness she dwells on and savors (III.v.113–23). Rosalind as a boy is,in Oliver’s words, “fair, of female favor” (IV.iii.86–87). Her maleness isglamourously half-female.The childhood liaison of Rosalind and Celia is also homoerotic. Shakespeare putsthe girls into emotional alignment from the first moment Rosalind is mentionedand before she has even appeared. “Never two ladies loved as they do”; they havebeen “coupled and inseparable,” even sleeping together (I.i.109, iii.71–74).This amorously exclusive friendship functions in the first act as a structuralcounterpoise to the adult marriages of the last act, which ends in a vision ofthe wedding god. In an essay on the use of “you” and “thou” in As You Like It,Angus McIntosh remarks that “you” often carries “an overtone of disgust andannoyance.” After they encounter Orlando in the Forest of Arden, Celia, with “anote of huffiness,” begins to “you” Rosalind, indicating “the intrusion ofOrlando into the cosiness of their hitherto undisturbed relationship.”13[ch25_notes.html#ch07note13a] I find evidence of Celia’s jealousy even in thefirst act, when Rosalind hangs back to compliment Orlando and Celia sayssharply, “Will you go, coz?” (I.ii.245). In the forest, Rosalind tries to getCelia to play the priest and marry her to the duped Orlando. “I cannot say thewords,” Celia replies (IV.i.121). She must be prodded three times before she canbring herself to give away the bride. That Shakespeare intends this subtext ofsexual tension seems proved by the fact that in his source in Lodge it is theCelia character who merrily invents and urges on the sham wedding ceremony.Because of the premodern prestige of virginity, the union of Rosalind and Celiais surely emotional and not overtly sexual. Their intimacy is that female matrixI found in Britomart’s bond to her nurse. In As You Like It the matrix is anearly stage of primary narcissism from which emerge the adult heterosexualcommitments of the finale. Midway through the play, Rosalind exclaims, “But whattalk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?” (III.iv.35–36). Familyand childhood alliances must yield to the new world of marriage. This is acharacteristic English Renaissance movement: exogamy reinforces the socialstructure. Rosalind undergoes a process of increasing sexual differentiation.She splits from Celia by psychic mitosis. Their friendship is an all-in-all ofgender, a solace for that motherlessness which Shakespeare curiously imposes onhis maidens, leaving them defenseless in Hamlet and Othello. At the end of AsYou Like It, Rosalind and Celia sacrifice their relationship to take up thefixed sex roles of marriage. A choice is made, not necessarily inevitable. HughRichmond was, to my knowledge, the first critic to freely admit Rosalind’s“capacity for bisexuality.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note14a] Unlike Viola,Rosalind is borderline. She could go either way. One of the unnoticed themes ofAs You Like It is Rosalind’s temptation toward her outlaw male extreme and herovercoming of it to enter the larger social order. She is distinctly flirtatiousin her prank with Phebe. Rosalind as Ganymede pretends to be a rakishlady-killer and, at her assumption of that sexual persona, actually becomes one.A superb language of arrogant command suddenly flows from her (III.v.35ff.). Sheis all sex and power. It is a complex psychological response to eroticopportunity, which she may or may not consciously recognize. In the scene inSpenser where she romances the dismayed Amoret, Britomart’s actions are divorcedfrom her thoughts, which are on her future husband. So Spenser and Shakespeareprefigure the modern theory of the unconscious, which Freud said was invented bythe Romantic poets. Britomart and Rosalind drift into an involuntary realm oflesbian courtship. Male disguise elicits wayward impulses from the sociallyrepressed side of their sexual nature.Are there any fixed coordinates for masculinity and femininity in Shakespeare’stransvestite comedies? Commentary on sex-differences can be fatuous, as inOrsino’s pontifications. Rosalind’s maxims on the sexes are usually satirical.In these plays, clothes make the man. By fixing the social persona, costumetransforms thought, behavior, and gender. The one distinction between male andfemale seems to be combat ability. Viola is afraid to duel, and Rosalind faintsat the sight of blood. Viola’s twin, Sebastian, on the other hand, ishot-tempered and slaps people around. So Shakespeare gives men a physical geniusthat will out. Aside from this, Shakespeare seems to view masculinity andfemininity as masks to put on and take off. He makes remarkably few allusions tosexual anatomy here: in the two plays I find one explicit remark and two orthree puns. Viola, quailing at a duel, cries, “A little thing would make me tellthem how much I lack of a man” (III.iv.313–15). Man minus “little thing” equalswoman. Rosalind’s resolve to “suit me all points like a man” hints at theobvious qualification that one male point isn’t ordinarily available to armysupply (I.iii.114). A clown parodies Orlando’s love verse: “He that sweetestrose will find / Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind” (III.ii.111–12) Toconsummate his love for Rosalind, the moping Orlando must recover his manlyautonomy. Like Artegall in drag, he must straighten up and take charge. Second,Rosalind as rose is both flower and thorn. Disguised as an armed male, she hasdual sexual attributes, the phallic “love’s prick” as well as the female genital“rose.” One expects more bawdiness in cross-dressing Renaissance imbroglios. Ina source of Twelfth Night, Barnabe Rich’s Of Apolonius and Silla (1581), Silvio,Viola’s precursor, reveals her sex at the end by “loosing his garments down tohis stomach,” showing “his breasts and pretty teats.” An arresting moment inboudoir reading, ill fit for the stage! Shakespeare’s treatment of sexualambiguity is remarkably chaste.Shakespeare’s characters often fail to read the correct sex of their colleaguesor even to recognize their own lovers onstage. The motif of twins mistaken forone another comes from Plautus and Terence, who took it from Greek New Comedy.But in classical drama, the twins are the same sex. The Renaissance, with itsattraction for the androgynous, altered the theme to opposite-sex twins. As ifsparked by the zeitgeist, Shakespeare managed to father boy-and-girl twins. Theuse of virtuoso boy actors in all female roles conditioned Elizabethan playgoersto a suspension of sexual disbelief. The textual ambiguities of the transvestitecomedies would be heightened by the presence of boys in the lead roles. Theepilogue to As You Like It, which some think not by Shakespeare, demandsaudience recognition of the theatrical transsexualism. The actor playingRosalind comes forward in female dress and addresses the audience: “If I were awoman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me.” A touch ofmale homosexual coquetry. At the end of performance, modern female impersonatorssimilarly step out from the dramatic frame, revealing their real sex by tearingoff wig and brassiere or emerging in tuxedo. Male portrayal of female roles inElizabethan theater was inherently more homoerotic than the same custom inGreece or Japan. Greek actors wore wooden masks; Japanese Kabuki employs heavyschematic makeup. Greek and Japanese actors could be any age. But Elizabethantheater used beardless boys, probably with wigs and some makeup. But there wereno masks. A boy had to be facially feminine enough to pass as a woman. Theerotic piquancy must surely have led to claques of groupies, like those doggingthe castrati of Italian opera.Earlier, I spoke of the androgynous beauty of adolescent boys and the religiouspurity of their singing voices. The boy-angel inhabiting the stage Rosalindadded his own hermaphroditism to an already sexually complex role. As You LikeIt and Twelfth Night played by boys would be shimmering spectacles of themystery of gender. The quality of spectacle is evident in the last act ofTwelfth Night, where the twins protract the traditional recognition scene tohypnotic length, a technique of cinematic slow motion I found in Shakespeare’sRape of Lucrece. London’s National Theatre attempted an all-male production ofAs You Like It in 1967, the costumes Sixties mod. The director sought “anatmosphere of spiritual purity.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note15a] The episodewhere Rosalind as Ganymede induces Orlando to mock-woo her would speciallybenefit from such idealizing treatment, for it is a dazzling series ofimpersonations: we see a boy playing a girl playing a boy playing a girl. Areviewer said this production was “as simple, stylised and, in fact, as cold asa Noh play.” Still, these actors were young adults, not boys. Roger Baker claimsboys as Rosalind and Viola would be “really unnerving”: “Boys can act with anatural gravity and grace.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note16a] Transvestite boys,we saw, led the Greek sacred procession of the Dionysian Oschophoria. Theirunmasked presence on the Elizabethan stage reproduced the archaic ritualism andcultism of early drama.Like Michelangelo’s poetry, Shakespeare’s sonnets are addressed to twolove-objects, a baffling forceful woman and a beautiful boy. The unidentifiedfair youth was evidently highly androgynous in appearance. Shakespeare calls him“angel,” “sweet boy,” “beauteous and lovely youth” (144, 108, 54). Most blatantis Sonnet 20, where Shakespeare calls the youth his “master mistress” and sayshe has “a woman’s face” and “a woman’s gentle heart.” Meaning him to be a woman,Nature “fell a-doting” and mistakenly added a penis. This is like Phaedrus’drunken Prometheus getting human genitals wrong. Sonnet 20 anticipates modernhormonal theory, where a fetus with male genitalia may retain female brainchemistry, producing an inner conviction of womanhood and a longing to changesex. The youth of Sonnet 20 is a hermaphrodite, facially and emotionally femalebut with the sexual superfluity of a penis—from which Shakespeare explicitlyabstains. I suspect Shakespeare, like Michelangelo, was a Greek homosexualidealist who did not necessarily seek physical relations with men. G. WilsonKnight says Shakespeare’s sonnets express “the recognition in his adored boy ofa bisexual strength-with-grace” and identifies this view with Plato’s, callingit “the seraphic intuition.” Knight writes brilliantly about erotic idealism,which transforms libidinal energy into aesthetic vision, “a floodedconsciousness”: “You must have a maximum of ardour with a minimum of possibleaccomplishment, so that desire is forced into eye and mind to create.”17[ch25_notes.html#ch07note17a]The beautiful boy belongs to the sonnets and must remain there. He cannot enterthe plays. Rosalind is the beautiful boy reimagined in social terms. Referencesto homosexuality are rare in Shakespeare’s plays. There may be homosexualovertones to Iago’s behavior in Othello and Leontes’ in The Winter’s Tale or toAntonio’s devotion to Sebastian in Twelfth Night and Patroclus’ to Achilles inTroilus and Cressida. But Shakespeare never dwells on homosexuality orconstructs a play or major character around it like his contemporary Marlowe,who opens Dido, Queen of Carthage with Jupiter “dandling Ganymede upon his knee”and Edward the Second with the king’s male lover reading a mash note in thestreet. That play ends with the anal execution of the homosexual king with ared-hot poker.I see in Shakespeare a segregation by genre, which diverts homosexuality intolyric and keeps it out of drama. I spoke of the Greek-invented beautiful boy asan Apollonian androgyne, silent and solipsistic. He is an objet d’art, broughtinto being by the admirer’s reverent eye. Silence is a threat to drama, whichthrives by voice. Northrop Frye speaks of “the self-enclosed world of theunproductive and narcissistic beautiful youth of Shakespeare’s sonnets, a‘liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass’.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note18a] Fryeis using an alchemical image from Sonnet 5, where summer flowers are distilledinto an alembic of perfume, like love and beauty transformed into art. Thebeautiful boy of the sonnets is asocial, self-absorbed. Shakespeare exhorts himto marry and beget heirs lest his patrician line end (Sonnets 1–17). Ironically,as I see it, if the youth were to make the social commitment of marriage, hewould immediately lose his glamourous narcissistic beauty, which is produced byhis removal from time and community. I have stressed that the Apollonian mode isharsh, absolutist, and separatist. Apollonian beings are incapable of Dionysianparticipation: they cannot “take part,” since Apollonianism is coldly unitary,indivisible. The transvestite Rosalind inherits the marriage obligation of thefair youth, whose refusal of social integration confines him to the sonnets. Abeautiful boy in the plays would seem shallow and small. In Shakespeare’s drama,the only Ganymede is a woman. In Rosalind, the beautiful boy makes the choicefor others rather than self.Shakespeare’s reflections upon androgynous personae were inspired by theRenaissance ferment in sex roles, which hit England later than Italy. Thedistance between these national phases of the Renaissance is illustrated by thefact that Shakespeare and Marlowe were born the same year Michelangelo died atage eighty-nine. Puritan preachers of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periodinveighed against effeminate men and masculine women wearing men’s clothes. ThusShakespeare’s transvestite comedies address a public issue and take a liberalposition on it. Unlike Botticelli, who allowed Savonarola to destroy his paganstyle, Shakespeare never yielded to Puritan pressure. In fact there is a turntoward decadence rather than away from it in his Jacobean plays. Shakespearecontinued to believe in sexual personae as a mode of self-definition. This themeis treated in different ways in his two principal genres. His sonnets circulatedin manuscript among an aristocratic coterie of Apollonian exclusiveness. But theplays were for the mixed social classes of the Globe Theatre, the democratic“Many” whom Plutarch identifies with Dionysus. Hence the psychic metamorphosesof Shakespeare’s androgynes were in analogy to the rowdy pluralism of hisaudience.That boy actors played girls is consistent with As You Like It’s claim that boysand women are emotionally alike. Rosalind as Ganymede claims she cured a man oflove by pretending to be his beloved: “At which time would I, being but amoonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud,fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; forevery passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women arefor the most part cattle of this color” (III.ii.400–06). There are intimationshere of the charming vexations of pederasty. Vergil’s Mercury says, “Woman isforever various and changeable” (Aen. IV.569–70). Verdi’s duke agrees: “La donnaè mobile.” Woman is mobile, changeable, fickle. Boys are moonish, as Rosalindputs it, because their mercurial inconstancy of mind resembles the ever-alteringphases of the feminine moon, ruler of women’s lives. Shakespeare is speaking ofadolescents, more proof that Van den Berg is wrong to say adolescence was nevernoticed and therefore did not exist before the Enlightenment. Rosalind’s speechis a catalog of rapid shifts of persona, that giddy free movement amongmood-states which I identify with the fun-loving but deceitful Hermes/Mercury.Are boys and women volatile by hormonal alchemy? Some male artists and writershave the nervous sensibility and delicate trembling fingers of women.Sensitivity begins in the body, which mind and vocation follow.Shakespeare elsewhere broadens his model of androgynous volatility to includespecial men or men in special situations. “The lunatic, the lover, and the poet/ Are of imagination all compact”: artists and lovers are like lunatics,literally moon-men (Midsummer V.i.7–8). To love “is to be all made of fantasy.”The true lover is “unstaid and skittish in all motions” save the beloved’simage. The lover should wear “changeable taffeta,” for his mind is “a very opal”(AYLI V.ii.93; Twelfth II.iv.17–20, 73–75). Love dematerializes masculinity.Things are glimmering, wavering, liquefied. Art and love dissolve social habitand form, a Dionysian fluidity. Shakespeare’s clowns also inhabit a déclasséworld of androgynous freedom. The medieval fool or jester had licensed access tosatiric commentary and multiple personae. In King Lear Shakespeare gives theasexual fool Zen-like maxims of ultimate truth, toward which the pompous kingmakes his painful way. In Romeo and Juliet the jester role is played by theill-starred nobleman Mercutio, named for his unruly mercurial temperament. Hisspeech is a mad rush of images, metaphors, puns. Woman, boy, lunatic, lover,poet, fool: Shakespeare unites them emotionally and psychologically. They sharethe same fantastical quickness and variability. They are in moonlike psychicflux, which becomes manic-depressive instability in the frantic Mercutio. As apoet, Shakespeare belongs to this invisible fraternity of mixed sex. Inwardly,he too is a mercurial androgyne. Sonnet 29 charts one of his crushingmood-swings—low, lower, then up and away with the lark of sunrise.Rosalind, the alchemical Mercurius, symbolizes comic mastery of multiplepersonae. Viola and Rosalind discipline their feelings, while the minorcharacters are full of excess and self-indulgence. Both women patiently maintaintheir male disguise in situations crying out for revelation. They differ,however, in their speech. Viola is discreet and solicitous, Rosalind aggressive,mischievous, bantering, railing. Riffling through her endless personae withmystical ease, Rosalind seems conscious of the fictiveness of personality. Shetheatricalizes her inner life. She stands mentally outside her role and allroles. Rosalind’s characteristic tone is roguish self-satire: “Make the doorsupon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement; shut that, and ’twill outat the keyhole; stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney”(IV.i.154–57). Her own darting wit is this gusty draft in the closed householdof Renaissance womanhood. Rosalind turns words to smoke, a spiritualisticemanation of her restless motility of thought. Her performance in drag is highcamp—a useful if passé homosexual term. The essence of camp is manner, notdécor. Rosalind fulfills Christopher Isherwood’s definition of camp: she mockssomething, her love for Orlando, which she takes seriously. Her supreme momentof high camp is the wooing scene, where she pretends to be what she reallyis—Rosalind.The Mercurius androgyne has the reckless dash and spontaneity of youth. Despiteour racy modern bias, if Rosalind were to keep her male disguise, she wouldcease to grow as a character. Shakespeare’s plays, I said, esteem developmentand process, Dionysian transformation. Rosalind transforms herself by going tothe forest, but she would stagnate if she stayed there. Her valiant Amazonpersonality would be diminished and trivialized. She would turn intoShakespeare’s other mercurial androgyne, the cavorting sky-spirit Ariel, who isall shape-shifting and speed, changing himself to Harpy and sea-nymph. Ariel,the trickster Till Eulenspiegel, and J. M. Barrie’s Peter Pan (a boy played byan actress), demonstrate the feminizing effects of psychic mutability on males.This reverses the principle I found in Michelangelo, where monumentalitymasculinizes women. Rosalind must put an end to her proteanism and rejoin theRenaissance social order. Modern productions completely miss the severe patternof ritualistic renunciation in As You Like It. Rosalind is not Peter Pan, nor isshe Virginia Woolf’s reckless, cigar-smoking Sally Seton. Rosalind is nevermadcap or flippant. Behind her playfulness of language and personae is apressure of magisterial will. Multiplicity of mood tends toward anarchy.Shakespeare’s Renaissance wisdom subordinates that multiplicity to socialstructure, containing its exuberant energies in marriage. In the Renaissance asnow, play must be part of a dialectic of work, or it becomes decadent.At the climax of As You Like It, Rosalind constructs a ceremony of farewell toher androgynous self. It is her moment of maximum wit or creative intelligence.The play’s romantic entanglements are in total confusion. Rosalind proclaimsthat by “magic” she will deliver to each person his or her heart’s desire. Therevelation of her own identity and gender is the key: As You Like It ends in analchemical experiment where Rosalind, as the hermaphroditic Mercurius,transmutes the play’s characters and destinies, including her own. The magnumopus begins with a chant, a spell or litany of erotic fixation and frustration.The lines go round and round in circle magic, rings of the alchemical uroboros(V.ii.82–118, iv. 116–24). The play proposes a riddle, as snarled as the Gordianknot. Rosalind’s personality, self-displayed, resolves these dismayingintricacies. When she appears undisguised, Rosalind is the surprise conclusionto an elegant sexual syllogism. Her shamanistic epiphany reorders the eroticchaos of the play. This Sphinx answers her own riddle. Oedipus’ reply, “Man,”works again, for Rosalind is the anthropos or perfected man of alchemy.Rosalind’s hybrid gender and perpetual transformations are the quicksilver ofthe alchemical Mercurius, who had the rainbow colors of the peacock’s tail. Jungsays Mercurius as quicksilver symbolizes “the ‘fluid’, i.e., mobile, intellect.”Mercurius, like Rosalind, is “both material and spiritual.”19[ch25_notes.html#ch07note19a] Rosalind’s spirituality is her purity, purpose,and romantic fidelity; her materiality is her realism and mordant pragmatism. Analchemical treatise of the early seventeenth century is called Atalanta Fugiens,“Atalanta in flight.” It makes the swift huntress a metaphor for “the strengthof the volatile Mercury.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note20a] As You Like Itcompares Rosalind to Atalanta and identifies wit with speed: “All thoughts… arewinged” (III.ii.147; IV.i.135; III.ii.273–74). In her emotional reserve andverbal agility, Rosalind is an Atalanta fugiens. The Philosopher’s Stone orhermaphroditic rebis of alchemy often has wings, which Jung interprets as“intuition or spiritual (winged) potentiality.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note21a]Both masculine and feminine, Rosalind is a Mercurius of swift, sovereignintelligence. Speed as hermaphroditic transcendance: we see this in Vergil’sAmazon Camilla and Giambologna’s ephebic Mercury in ecstatic flight.Rosalind is the catalyst of As You Like It, the magic elixir transmuting baseinto noble metals. The editor of Atalanta Fugiens remarks, “Mercurius is themercury in which the metals have to be dissolved, reduced to the primary matterbefore they can become gold.”22 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note22a] The rebis, wenoted, is often shown as incestuous brother and sister. Shakespeare alters theforest roles of Lodge’s Rosalynde and Aliena (Celia) from page and mistress tobrother and sister, as if to facilitate an alchemical analogy. This change doesnot preclude eroticism, in view of the lesbian tinge to Rosalind and Celia’sfriendship. As first cousins, they too risk incest. The primary transactionsundertaken by Shakespeare’s Mercurius are the Sylvius-Phebe romance (which turnstriangle) and the bamboozling of the lovelorn Orlando. These alchemicalexperiments, in the closed glass retort of the play, succeed. Like Nero,Rosalind experiments with person and place. But hers is white rather than blackmagic, leading to love and marriage rather than debauchery and death. Lodge’sRosalynde claims to have a friend “deeply experienced in necromancy and magic,”but Shakespeare’s Rosalind boldly arrogates these occult powers to herself.Rosalind is both producer and star of the finale. Her hierarchically mostcommanding moment is paradoxically the one where she ritually lays aside herhermaphroditism to take up the socialized persona of obedient wife to Orlando.Her incantatory speech in female dress ceremonially restores heterosexualnormality to the play. In it she names and cleanses her major socialrelationships, then reifies them. A new social structure is being constructed,with her father reinvested with his ducal authority. “Ducdame, ducdame,ducdame,” sings Jaques in the forest, a nonsense word bemusing scholars(II.v.49). I say, the duke is a dame. Rosalind, as much as her uncle, hasusurped her father’s manhood. Now she surrenders what is not hers to reclaim herown sex.Rosalind’s magic is real, for she produces Hymen, the marriage spirit who enterswith her in the last scene. Hymen is a prominent figure in court masque, but heis conspicuously out of place in a Shakespeare play. He is an embarrassment tomodern commentators on the play, who ignore him whenever possible. Why thisallegorical invasion of the naturalistic As You Like It? First of all, Hymensymbolizes the mass marriages which end Shakespearean comedy. He isreconciliation and social harmony, knitting the classes and leading the banishedcharacters back to the redeemed city. But Hymen is also a by-product of theplay’s psychoalchemy. The alchemical operation had two parts: distillation andsublimation. Hymen, traditionally depicted as a beautiful young man, is a sexualsublimate. He is the emanation or double of Rosalind herself. He is the ghost ofher maleness, exorcised but lingering on to preside over the exit from Arden.Shakespeare’s technique here is allegorical repletion, the term I invented forLeonardo’s The Virgin with St. Anne. Hymen’s odd doubling of Rosalind is likeLeonardo’s awkward photographic superimposition of two female figures. Sexualpersonae flood the eye. The characters of As You Like It stand startled. Hymenis their collectively projected mental image of the transvestite Rosalind, nowonly a memory. Hymen is a visible distillation of her transsexual experience. Inher romantic conspiracies, Rosalind has impersonated Hymen and hence evoked hispresence. As the Mercurius who overcomes sexual duality and perfects basematerials, she possesses the magnetic power of concord, ensuring the integrityof Renaissance social order.Rosalind is, to borrow a phrase from Paracelsus, “a fiery and perfect Mercuryextracted by Nature and Art.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note23a] She reinterpretsthe classical Amazon, making physical prowess intellectual. Rosalind isShakespeare’s version of Spenser’s glamourous androgynes. Britomart’s flashingarmour and flaming sword become Rosalind’s unanswerable wit. Shakespeare’stransvestite heroine has masculine pride, verve, and cool aristocraticcontrol—scarcely to be found in today’s simplistic, innocuous Rosalinds. Theideal Rosalind must have both lyricism and force. There must be intelligence,depth, spontaneity, something quick and vivacious, with a hint of the wild anduncontrolled. The girl-boy Rosalind is in Atalanta-flight from mood to mood, anadolescent skittishness. The closest thing I have ever seen to Shakespeare’sauthentic Rosalind is Patricia Charbonneau’s spirited performance as a coltishReno cowgirl in Donna Deitch’s film Desert Hearts (1985), based on a lesbianlove story by Jane Rule.Rosalind as Mercurius has a quick smile and mobile eye. Shakespeare’s view ofwoman is revolutionary. Unlike Belphoebe or Britomart, Rosalind has a jovialinner landscape. It is not Spenser’s grim arena of virtue’s battle with vice.This landscape is airy and pleasant, full of charm and surprise. Rosalind’sself-pleasuring is not like Mona Lisa’s. No daemonic fog of solipsism hangs overher. Rosalind has an invigorating alertness. She is not smugly half-asleep, likeLeonardo’s Renaissance woman. Mona Lisa still has the baleful Gorgon eye ofarchaic archetype. She burns us with her glance. The daemonic eye sees nothingbut its prey. It seeks power, the fascism of nature. But Rosalind’s socializedeye moves to see. It takes things in. Hers are not the lustful rolling eyes ofSpenser’s femmes fatales, which slither, pierce, and possess. Rosalind’s eyehonors the integrity of objects and persons. Its mobility signals a mentalprocessing of information, the visible sign of western intelligence. In Spenser,we saw, the virtuous eye is rigidly controlled. Until our century, a respectablewoman kept her eyes modestly averted. Shakespeare legitimizes bold mobility ofthe female eye and identifies it with imagination. Rosalind’s eye is trulyperceptive: it both sees and understands. Shakespeare’s great heroine unitesmultiplicity of gender, persona, word, eye, and thought.Despite his love for the glamourous personality of multiple moods and masks,Shakespeare subordinates all his characters to the public good. The great chainof being reasserts itself at the end of his plays. The psycho-alchemic patternof Shakespeare’s comedies is release, remelting, and reincorporation in society.So Dionysian fluidity and metamorphoses move toward a final Apollonian ordering,a Renaissance moral value in which Shakespeare rejoins Spenser. In Antony andCleopatra (1606–07) Shakespeare amplifies the psychology of his transvestitecomedies. Antony and Cleopatra shows us what happens when sexual personae refusereincorporation in society and insist on remaining in nature, the realm ofperpetual transformations. This play confirms that the price of Rosalind’sremaining an androgyne in the Forest of Arden would be spiritual death.Antony and Cleopatra, long thought technically flawed, may be the favoriteShakespeare play of my generation of critics. Unlike older scholars, some of usfind King Lear boring and obvious, and we dread having to teach it to resentfulstudents. Antony and Cleopatra has come into its own. Its choppy multitude ofscenes, flying about the ancient Mediterranean, do not irritate sensibilitiesschooled on cinema. Here again is Shakespeare’s mobile eye. Spenser’s camera isthe obsessive zoom lens, concentrated and iconistic. But Shakespeare’s hand-heldcamera takes to the air, dominating western space. Antony and Cleopatra closelyfollows its source in Plutarch. But as usual, Shakespeare adds his ownmetamorphic metaphors and pyrotechnic personae. I see this play as the mostthorough of Shakespeare’s replies to Spenser. The Egypt of Antony and Cleopatrais Spenser’s Bower of Bliss, fertile stamping ground of the femme fatale. ButShakespeare, the Dionysian alchemist, is determined to rescue nature from itsdaemonic taint. He will show it at its rawest and most brutal, then defend it.Yet Renaissance order must have the last word.Over the past century, Shakespeare’s Cleopatra has undergone a radical change incritical fortunes. She used to be the lowest of the low among Shakespeare’sprotagonists. Her sexual libertinism and volatility led to Victorian andpost-Victorian vilification. Her sharp mood-changes were thought moralduplicity. In scholarly literature before the feminist 1970s, rare indeed is acomment like A. C. Bradley’s: “Many unpleasant things can be said of Cleopatra;and the more that are said the more wonderful she appears.”24[ch25_notes.html#ch07note24a] Perhaps apocryphally, a Victorian theatergoerleaving a production of Antony and Cleopatra remarked, “How different from thedomestic life of our own dear Queen.” Since then, there has been a huge shift insexual assumptions about women, from which Cleopatra has profited. TheVictorians admired Cordelia, Lear’s one honest daughter, as the saintlyperfection of femininity. To me, probably as time-bound as they, Cordelia seemsa vapid nincompoop, self-righteous and self-thwarting. Even for her mostgenerous apologists, Cleopatra presents interpretative problems. Hertemperamental excesses make people uneasy. She is, in my terms, Shakespeare’smost uncontrolled and uncontrollable Dionysian androgyne, the metamorphosingMercurius who obeys no law but her own. Hence she cannot survive her play.Spenser makes England’s fierce Virgin Queen an ivory Diana. Shakespeare makesher an umber Venus. Antony and Cleopatra is a Baroque Venus and Mars, burstingSpenser’s chaste Botticellian line. Shakespeare repeats The Faerie Queene’spsychological dialectic of definitiveness and dissolution, but he reverses itsmeanings. Apollonian social order again opposes Dionysian energy and wins. ButShakespeare, unlike Spenser, gives his imaginative sympathies to the Dionysianextremists. The traditional persona of republican Rome, we saw, was fixed to thepoint of rigidity. Antony and Cleopatra takes place at a great transition inhistory, when empire replaces republic, creating the era of international peacein which Christianity would spread. The old masculine Roman virtues are suddenlypassé. Only Antony, the sexually most unstable male in Shakespeare’s play,extols machismo. His contempt for Octavius Caesar, the politician who refuses tomeet him in hand-to-hand combat, strikes even us as faintly anachronistic, andhis challenge is dismissed as absurd by the gruff Enobarbus, the lone Roman whohas not yet smoothed his blunt speech into the glib diplomacy of the dawning ageof empire.In Antony and Cleopatra Rome follows a conservative republican psychology. Romanpersonality is strictly delimited, preserving the bounds of ego. At the news ofAntony’s death, Caesar declares, “The breaking of so great a thing should make agreater crack” (V.i.14–15). He means the announcing of so important an eventshould make a louder noise, like a thunderclap. But Caesar also envisionsAntony’s death as the toppling and shattering of a statue, a colossus.Throughout the play, Roman personality is static and brittle, like stone. Caesardefines identity and kinship in legalistic terms. The abstract and public takeprecedence over the concrete, emotional, and sensuous (III.vi.6). The Romansconstantly condemn Antony for abandoning the former for the latter. Roman socialorder is hierarchically inflexible, as Ventidius shrewdly sees. Rome’s voice isthe bleak reality principle of political expediency. In Egypt, on the otherhand, energy pours into self-expression. Antony and Cleopatra’s Alexandrianrevels are an endless round of feasts and games. Enobarbus saw the pantingCleopatra “hop forty paces through the public street” (II.ii.235). Dionysianbeings are playful and democratic. As queen, Cleopatra is indifferent todecorum. Her hilarity contrasts with Caesar’s puritanical sobriety. Caesarstands on ceremony. He is driven by a single purpose, consolidation of theMediterranean under Roman rule. He has no personal life. He completelyidentifies private with public interest. Hence he is unstoppable. Such men canbe political geniuses or monsters.Roman time and Roman space also obey Apollonian laws. Caesar sees time as alinear strip, a Roman triumph, the chronicle of civic history (V.i.65–66).Cleopatra blurs time in the eternal now of imagination. Narrated memories inEgypt have such emotional immediacy they seem more vivid than events before us.Enobarbus, a Roman in Rome, is overcome by Egyptian memory when he describesCleopatra on her royal barge. Caesar remembers only for duty or revenge.Throughout the play, Roman space is defined by images of closure, contrastingwith Antony and Cleopatra’s expansive “new heaven, new earth” of love (Li. 17).Space is cut up like urban districts, the Apollonian borderlines of Greek demesand tracts. The Romans speak of hoops, edges, fences, stalls, pillars, the rigidlanguage of public architecture and Apollonian containment.Antony and Cleopatra respect no boundaries. Antony’s infatuation “o’erflows themeasure.” He sends “his bounty overplus” even to defectors. His heart and chestburst his buckles. The heart of dead Cleopatra strains to blow free. Caesarplaces Antony’s old legions in the vanguard “that Antony may seem to spend hisfury upon himself” (Li.2.; IV.vi.22; IV.vi.10–11). Even his archenemyacknowledges Antony’s transpersonal extensiveness of identity. Everything inEgypt is abundance, profligacy, Dionysian too-muchness: “Eight wild boarsroasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there” (II.ii.185–86).Caesar tries to channel and subdue the flood of emotion and sensation which isEgyptian experience. His victory is signalled when Cleopatra is “confined” toher tomb, the “frame” of his own Apollonian will (V.i.52–56). Like Blake’styrant Urizen, Caesar lays the cold compass of Apollonian measure uponCleopatra’s “infinite variety” (II.ii.242).Caesar’s Roman world-view is a desiccated or devivified Apollonianism:hierarchical order and dignity, intellectual categorization, the sharp-edgedunitary ego, separation from sexuality and the sensory. Caesar’s patron is, touse Nietzche’s phrase, “Apollo, the founder of states.”25[ch25_notes.html#ch07note25a] Cleopatra’s world-view is promiscuously Dionysian:abolition of limits and boundaries, multiple personae, eating and drinking, sex,anarchic energy, natural fecundity. Caesar and his retinue call Antonyeffeminate, yet Antony is more masculine than Caesar in the usual sense. Caesar,a bland managerial type, is sexually neuter. He is an Apollonian androgyne. Thedominant sexual persona of Spenser’s Faerie Queene has completely lost itsglamour in Shakespeare’s Dionysian genre. In Antony and Cleopatra, Apollonianismis merely officiousness, the spite and banality of small minds.Cleopatra’s Dionysian multiplicity is richly illustrated throughout the play.For example, when she hears of Antony’s marriage to Octavia, Cleopatra swervesback and forth between extreme emotions five times in ten lines (II.v.109–19).Each mood-swing, toward and away from Antony, has its own operatic tone,gesture, and posture. Critics used to wonder which is the “real” Cleopatra, orwhere is she? The secondary selves must be cunning stratagems. Worse, the issueof Octavia’s height and hair color, interwoven with Cleopatra’s lamentations andfaintings, make the queen seem silly and superficial in academic eyes. How likea woman! But Cleopatra is an actress, and as we shall see, theatricality is themodel of human psychology in Antony and Cleopatra. Cleopatra is the sum of hermasks.Cleopatra’s Dionysianism dissolves male into female. The fruitful femaleprinciple is so dominant in Shakespeare’s Egyptian Bower of Bliss that malepower is dwarfed and stymied. Cleopatra is surrounded by eunuchs, disdained bythe Romans. The historical Antony was already a notorious drinker and carouserbefore he met Cleopatra, but in the play he is charged with Egyptiandegeneration after a nobly stoic Roman past. For the Romans, Antony suffers areduction of identity through his feminizing association with Cleopatra. ButShakespeare sees it as an aggrandizement of identity which Antony, unlikeRosalind, is unable to control. Cleopatra recalls a transvestite game where shedecked Antony in her robes and headdress while she strapped on his battle sword(II.v.22–23). This detail is not in Plutarch, though everything else in thepassage is. Surely Shakespeare is directly addressing Spenser here. He takesArtegall’s transvestite enslavement to the Amazon queen and recasts it withDionysian dramatic energy. What is shameful and depressing in Spenser becomesplayful and mirthful. Artegall is at a dead end. But Shakespeare’s transvestiteAntony and Cleopatra give the impression of vitality, of identity opening andmultiplying. Exchange of clothing is a paradigm for the emotional union of love.Antony and Cleopatra so interpenetrate that they are mistaken for one another(I.ii.80).Even before she absorbs Antony’s identity, Cleopatra is robustly half-masculine.Rivalled only by Rosalind, Cleopatra appropriates the powers and prerogatives ofboth sexes more lavishly than any other character in literature. Her sexualpersonae are energized by stormy infusions of Dionysian nature-force. HereRosalind is more limited because more civilized. Cleopatra is psychicallyimmersed in the irrational and barbaric. She is voluptuously female, a rarity inShakespeare. Her sexuality is so potent in European terms that the Romans arealways calling her whore, strumpet, trull. As the “serpent of old Nile,” she isthe archetypal femme fatale (I.v.25). Cleopatra appears costumed as Isis, whomas queen she literally embodies. Her main distinction from the mocking Rosalindis her maternalism, which makes her cradle the asp like “my baby at my breast”(V.ii.309). The mother is one of Cleopatra’s many personae, but Rosalind andSpenser’s Britomart will become mothers only outside the frame of their works.This is because the archetype behind Rosalind is the chaste beautiful boy.Cleopatra is a virago, the androgynous type I found in Michelangelo’s MediciChapel nudes, with their thrusting breasts. Rosalind inhabits the crisp Forestof Arden, the Northern European green world. But Cleopatra belongs to theheat-enervated Orient, whose oppressiveness hangs over Michelangelo’s women.Cleopatra is not more feminine than Rosalind, but she is far more female.Cleopatra greets the messenger: “Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears”(II.v.24). A pagan Annunciation. Physically craving the absent Antony, Cleopatrais a sexual vessel forcibly filled. Yet the penetrating force is hers; sheinvokes it by command. Her overwrought metaphor incidentally implies a touch ofhomosexual perversion in the murder-by-ear of Hamlet Senior in his drowsySpenserian bower.Cleopatra’s male persona is equally strong. As queen of Egypt, Cleopatra, likeHatshepsut, is an impersonation of a royal male. Janet Adelman suggests thatCleopatra wearing Antony’s sword is a Renaissance Venus armata and that forbattle at Actium she would appear in male dress.26 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note26a]Psychologically, Cleopatra is always armed. She has a fiery belligerence. Shethreatens to bloody her maid’s teeth; she even threatens Antony, using a punwhich advertises her penis-envy (I.iii.40–41; ii.58–61). When the messengerarrives with news of Antony’s marriage, Cleopatra passes beyond threats toactual assault and battery, hitting him, hauling him up and down, and pulling aknife. Such scenes caused the long critical resistance to Cleopatra. By modernmiddle-class standards, they require defense. Shakespeare gives Cleopatra anintemperate flair for masculine violence unique in the sympathetic portrayal ofwomen in literature. The violence of Medea or Lady Macbeth is transient, eithermale-inspired or deflected through a male’s action. In Cleopatra violence isconstantly present as a potential male persona. It is the raging warfare of herhermaphrodite character. For parallels we must go to villainesses like Lear’sdaughters or outside social literature to mythic horrors like Scylla. IntoCleopatra as Isis flows the untransformed energy of nature, sheer sex andviolence.Is it unseemly for queens to brawl? Dionysian beings instinctively subvert thehierarchical. As an Italian, I have little problem reconciling violence withculture. Rousseau drove the wedge between aggression and culture, so colorfullyunited in the Renaissance. Cleopatra’s pugilistic energy is matched by hersadistic imagination and flights of daemonic metaphor, where eyeballs are puntedlike footballs and whipped bodies steeped in pickle brine (II.v.63–66).Shakespeare shows us the turbulent emotion-in-action of the Dionysian androgyne.Language seethes like boiling oil. Cleopatra’s rabid speeches sound moreshocking to Anglo-American than to Mediterranean ears. A savage vehemence ofspeech is common among southern peoples, due to the nearness of agriculture andthe survival of pagan intensity. Those who live on and by the land recognizenature’s terrible amorality. Cleopatra’s sadistic images are normal in Italianterms. My immigrant relatives used to say, “May you be killed!” or “May you beeaten by a cat!” Common Italian-American expressions, according to my father,took the form “Che te possono” (May such and such be done to you). For example,“May your eyes be torn out,” “May you drag your tongue along the ground,” “Maythey squeeze your testicles,” “May they sew up your anus.” The similarity toCleopatra’s rhetorical style is obvious. Torture and homicide are immediatelyaccessible to the Mediterranean imagination.I called Dionysian impulses sadistic, but the proper term is sadomasochistic,both active and passive. Provoked, Cleopatra is off on runaway flights ofmasochistic vision. It is the psychic countercurrent to her aggression, whatHeracleitus calls enantiodromia, “running to its opposite.” When Antony callsher “cold-hearted,” she blurts out a surreal fantasy of poison hail, blightedwombs, and unburied bodies covered with flies and gnats (III.xiii.158–67). Takenprisoner, she storms that, preferable to jeers in Rome, let her naked corpse bethrown into the mud and swelled up by waterflies—or hung in chains on a pyramid(V.ii.55–62). Cleopatra’s sadomasochistic imagination makes Dionysian leapsthrough nature. Her body is the earth mother torn by the strife of the elementsin the cycle of birth and death. Ugliness, pain, abortion, and decay arenature’s reality. Cleopatra’s rough speech has a daemonic eloquence. Shakespeareopens a window into the unconscious, where we see the sex and violence we carrywithin us. There is the grinding dreamwork, spewing out metaphors which appallus. Cleopatra’s images tumble out with bruising force, like the boulders tossedlike chaff in Coleridge’s underground river.The passionately active Cleopatra contrasts with feminine, retiring Octavia.Chaste Octavia is a “swan’s-down feather” on the tide: she is will-less, thepawn of larger forces. She is of “a holy, cold, and still conversation,” a modelRoman matron. She moves so primly “She shows a body rather than a life, / Astatue than a breather” (III.ii.48; II.vi.122–23; III.iii.23–24). Like brother,like sister. In Shakespeare, iconic Apollonian statues are dead wood.Cleopatra’s Dionysian proteanism and velocity take Shakespeare’s eye. He makesOctavia’s virtue seem torpid. Octavia is matter and Cleopatra energy. Cleopatrais scourge, not feather. Her dominion over gender is dramatized in athletictransformations of dizzying speed. “I am pale, Charmian,” she murmurs—and a linelater leaps at the messenger and slugs him to the floor (II.v.59–61). Cleopatravaults from one sexual extreme to the other, barely taking breath. The delicateLady of the Camellias switch-hits with burly Ajax. The genders soindiscriminately mingle in Cleopatra that she makes transsexual word errorsunder stress (II.v.40–41, 116, 45). Cleopatra has a Dionysian all-inclusiveness.She breaks through social restraints to plunge into the sensual, orgiasticpleasure of pure feeling.Cleopatra embodies the Dionysian principle of theatricality. Shakespeare oftenmakes analogies between personality and stagecraft but never, save in Hamlet, sosystematically as he does in Antony and Cleopatra. From first scene to last,public and private behavior is critiqued in terms of performance. Politicsitself is stage-managed. Antony and Cleopatra are always going in and out oftheir legendary roles as Antony and Cleopatra. For Cleopatra, life is theater.She is a master propagandist. Truth is inconsequential; dramatic values aresupreme. Cleopatra shamelessly manipulates others’ emotions like clay. Once hercleverness misfires, when she sends word she is dead and Antony kills himself.Cleopatra resembles Rosalind in the gleeful way she throws herself into a role.This is so even at her lowest moment, when she scripts her suicide. LikeRosalind, Cleopatra is producer and star of play’s end. She makes a masque-liketableau of her own death. Shakespeare presses Renaissance theatricality beyondmoral norms. Metamorphoses are horrific for both Spenser and Dante, who consignsimpersonation to one of the lowest circles of the Inferno: incestuous Myrrha,“falsifying herself in another’s form,” is classed with liars and counterfeiters(XXX.41). Puritan hostility to theater was justified. Secular theater isGreco-Roman and therefore pagan. Shakespeare makes Cleopatra his accomplice andadvocate for dramatic impersonation.Cleopatra has a sensational flair for improvisation and melodrama. Her vampingand camping are more extreme than Rosalind’s as Ganymede. Cleopatra’s posturesof romantic martrydom are as self-parodying as a drag queen’s. Self-parody isalways sex-parody. The virtuoso tone of Cleopatra’s theatrics recurs in Wilde’sThe Importance of Being Earnest, where it clearly springs from wholesaledesexualization of the characters. Cleopatra’s moment of maximum consciousnessof persona is when she sets aside both feminine swooning and masculineintimidation for a briskly efficient interrogation of the messenger. She extortsintelligence on Octavia’s age, height, voice, hair, and face shape (III.iii). Iconsider this neglected scene one of the classic moments in all drama. A game ofpersonae is being played. Cleopatra is mentally auditioning Octavia, cattilyrevising her virtues downward, always with her rival’s theatrical impact onAntony in mind. Cleopatra is gracious and queenly, but we tangibly feel hersense of her persona, as well as her maid Charmian’s sense of it. Charmian, likea church deacon, keeps piping up the required response, in ritual antiphony.Shakespeare makes us see Cleopatra’s detachment from her masks and yet hercomplete identification with them. Her showy self-representations have bothintellectual duality and hierarchic authority. Cleopatra is Shakespeare’sdespotic Muse of drama.The only character in literature whose theatrical personae rival Cleopatra’s isAuntie Mame. Patrick Dennis’ Auntie Mame (1955) is the American Alice inWonderland and in my view more interesting and important than any “serious”novel after World War II. The original book is far sharper than the wonderfulplay and movie (1958), starring the great Rosalind Russell. The subsequentmusical and Lucille Ball movie (1974) are of little worth, turning the regalAuntie Mame into trivial spunk and cuddles. I mentioned Auntie Mame as a type ofthe Mercurius androgyne. She is an archaeologist of persona. Each event, eachphase of life is registered in a change of costume and interior décor. Style andsubstance are one, in the Wildean manner. When the story opens in the Twenties,Auntie Mame is in her Chinese period, her Beekman Place apartment as exotic asShakespeare’s Egypt. Like Cleopatra, Auntie Mame stands for a flamboyant,extravagant, wine-drenched, ethnically diverse world threatened by a rationalistApollonian prude, the WASP banker Mr. Babcock, Mame’s Caesar-like chiefantagonist. Like Cleopatra, Mame is attended by androgynes—a giggling eunuchlikeJapanese houseboy, a virago confidante (the actress and drunk, Vera Charles),and epicene party-guests (a “woman-man and man-woman”). Like Cleopatra, Mame isbossy, peremptory, and given to “a little half-hour show of histrionics,” “herlifetime habit.” Like Cleopatra, she has so many feminine personae that,mysteriously, she ends up ceasing to seem female at all. My Hermes/Mercuryprinciple: a multitude of personae suspends gender. One remembers Mame’s longgreen lacquered fingernails and sweeping bamboo cigarette holder, her Orientalrobe of embroidered golden silk, her black satin sheets and bed jacket of pinkostrich feathers. Panic and crisis: how does one dress for Scarsdale? “Anydiscussion of clothing always won Auntie Mame’s undivided attention.” Trying toavoid a Georgia fox hunt, Mame “powdered herself dead white” and put on “anunbecoming shade of green.”27 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note27a] Auntie Mame is astudy of multiple impersonations, the theatrical principle of western selfhood.Emotion is instantly objectified. Costume, speech, and manner are a public paganlanguage of the inner life.Expiring with emotion upon learning of her new rival, Cleopatra manages toconvey to her envoy, “Let him not leave out the color of her hair.” Like AuntieMame, Cleopatra, a creature of theater, sees persona as a mirror of soul. Thepagan folk sciences, astrology, palmistry, and phrenology, have never forgottenthat externals are truth. Beauty is only skin-deep; you can’t tell a book by itscover: these pious axioms come from a contrary moral tradition. The aesthete,who lives in a world of surfaces, and the male homosexual, who lives in a worldof masks, believe in the absoluteness of externals. That is why Auntie Mame wasa diva of homosexuals. Cleopatra’s multiple personae are far from femininefickleness. She represents a radical theatricality in which the inner world iscompletely transformed into the outer.Did Shakespeare base Cleopatra on an Italian model? A. L. Rowse thinks the DarkLady of the sonnets was the half-Italian Emilia Bassanio. Luigi Barzinidescribes “the importance of spectacle” in Italian culture, with its publicstaging of emotional scenes. He speaks of “the transparency of Italian faces,”which allows conversations to be followed at a distance: “Undisguised emotions,some sincere and some feigned, follow each other on an Italian’s face as swiftlyas the shadows of clouds over a meadow on a windy day in spring.”28[ch25_notes.html#ch07note28a] Shakespeare’s self-dramatizing Cleopatra has afluid Italian expressiveness. In her amoral dissimulations, she confirms thenegative Northern European view of Italian and papist character in theRenaissance. Renaissance England was more flamboyant than modern England butless so than Renaissance Italy. Hence in the spiritual geography of Antony andCleopatra, Egypt is to Rome as Renaissance Italy was to Renaissance England.Cleopatra belongs to an emotional and sexual southland. But Shakespeare is wellaware of the anarchic danger in a life of impersonations. Caesar wins in Antonyand Cleopatra because he represents political order, the dream of the fractured,fractious Renaissance. Antony and Cleopatra’s reactionary political premise isborne out by Italian history, where theatrical individualism weakenedcentralized authority, aiding the rise of the tribal Mafia. Since World War II,nearly fifty governments have come and gone in Rome. Restless change is therule.We turn now to the ultimate question of Shakespeare’s play. If Cleopatracontains all emotional modes and all powers of male and female, why is shedefeated by the world? Why is she not a perfected image of man? Cleopatra dies,while Rosalind triumphantly survives, because Cleopatra is an incompleteMercurius and as such cannot advance her play toward the goal of EnglishRenaissance art: social and hierarchical consolidation. An important imagepattern in Antony and Cleopatra has aroused little or no comment. Astrology,even more than alchemy, was one of the great symbol systems of the Renaissance.Its iconography pervaded Renaissance art, book illustration, and interior décor.The formidable combined forces of Judeo-Christianity and modern science havenever succeeded in wiping out pagan astrology, nor will they ever. Astrologysupplies what is missing in the west’s official moral and intellectual codes.Astrology is the oldest organized art form of sexual personae. Waging war onastrology, the medieval and Renaisssance Church promulgated the distortion thatastrology is fatalism, a flouting of God’s Providence and the necessity formoral struggle. But the predictive part of astrology is less important than itspsychology, which three thousand years of continuous practice have given aphenomenal subtlety. Astrology does insist upon self-discipline andself-transformation. Judging astrology by those vague sun-sign columns in thedaily paper is like judging Christianity by a smudged shop window ofblack-velvet day-glo paintings of the Good Shepherd. The idea that the starsliterally influence men (by a falling fluid, an influenza) is plainly untenable.But that the movements of the constellations are a clock by which earthlychanges can be measured is less easy to dismiss. I subscribe to what Jung callssynchronicity. Things happen in complex patterns of apparent coincidence,noticed by the keen eyes of the artist. Astrology links man to nature, its majorpoint of departure from Judeo-Christianity. The Greek word zodiac means circleof animals. Most birth signs are symbolized by animals, whose characterastrology identifies with human types. Our behaviorist age is generallyresistant to the idea of genetic traits, for individuals, sexes, or races. Butask any mother of a large family whether personality is innate or learned. Shesenses a child’s inborn shyness or aggression from earliest infancy. People whodismiss astrology do so out of either ignorance or rationalism. Rationalistshave their place, but their limited assumptions and methods must be kept out ofthe arts. Interpretation of poem, dream, or person requires intuition anddivination, not science.The Renaissance embraced astrology as part of its infatuation with sexualpersonae. Antony and Cleopatra, Shakespeare’s greatest drama of sexual personae,makes astrological metaphors crucial to its psychological design. Each sign ofthe zodiac is associated with one of the four elements, named by thepre-Socratic philosopher Empedocles. From long study, I summarize theastrological meaning of the elements as follows. Fire is will, originality,boldness, the amoral life force. Air is language, wit, balance, humaneperspective. Water is intuition, sympathy, deep feeling, mystical oneness, andprophecy. Earth is order, method, precision, realism, materialism. Modernscience discarded the four elements in favor of finer terminology. From the lateRenaissance on, more and more basic elements were discovered, now approachingone hundred. John Anthony West claims, however, that the four principal elementsof modern organic chemistry, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, closelycorrespond in function to fire, earth, air, and water.29[ch25_notes.html#ch07note29a] Northrop Frye says, “Earth, air, water, and fireare still the four elements of imaginative experience, and always will be.”30[ch25_notes.html#ch07note30a] A person’s natal horoscope sometimes lacks one ofthe four elements, a disturbing imbalance which can and should be compensatedfor through self-analysis and vigilant effort. My theory is that Shakespeare hascast for Cleopatra a horoscope lacking the element of earth and that thispsychic incompletion, with her refusal to correct it, dooms both herself andAntony.The most poetic speech in the play, by normally curt Enobarbus, is a gorgeousdreamlike memory of Cleopatra’s arrival at Tarsus to meet Antony: “The barge shesat in, like a burnished throne, / Burned on the water” (II.ii.197–98).Cleopatra is Venus in motion, a Dionysian epiphany. Shakespeare is answering thefrozen iconic entrance of Spenser’s Belphoebe, the Apollonian Diana. With itsgold deck and purple sails, the barge is the Amazon sanctuary of PhoenicianDido, whom Vergil decks with red and gold. Cleopatra carries her own bower withher, getting it out of the swampy Spenserian glade onto the brisk high seas.Shakespeare’s motion picture has its own soundtrack, flute music and the beatingof silver oars. Air and water swirl toward the barge, which exudes “a strangeinvisible perfume.” A magnetism or suction pulls people out of the marketplacetoward the wharves. Cleopatra as Venus is the power of physical attraction amongthe elements, which Empedocles attributes to Aphrodite. She is in heat:Shakespeare carefully adds fire to his tableau. That the barge “burns” is hisaddition to Plutarch’s description. Cleopatra is Venus born from the sea. InEnobarbus’ speech, she commands three elements: water, air, and fire. Earth ispointedly excluded. In fact, earth is evacuated, denuded of its properties bythe rush of citizens shoreward. Shakespeare’s Cleopatra is the free play ofsovereign imagination, hostile to the steadfastness and stability of earth.The climax of Antony and Cleopatra is the battle of Actium, a turning point inwestern history. Antony’s loss is Caesar’s gain and the beginning of Romanempire, united under one man. Shakespeare stunningly mythologizes Plutarch’saccount, without loss of factual accuracy. He introduces elemental metaphorseffecting a poetic transformation of history. Antony’s fateful decision to fightby sea ruins him. Commander of infantrymen and master of land warfare, hefoolishly allows Cleopatra to dictate his battle plan. The Egyptians areseafarers. Cleopatra insists the ultimate contest with Caesar be by navy, notarmy. Antony’s seasoned soldiers passionately appeal to him, but blinded bylove, he waves them away. In agreeing to fight by sea, Antony repudiates theelement of earth, the foundation of his illustrious career. At the same time, heshrugs off common sense and practicality, qualities astrologically symbolized byearth. In imposing the element of water upon her lover, Cleopatra destroys him.Shakespeare weaves the elemental imagery into the play from the start, so thatthe words “land” and “sea” chime ominously in the deliberations at Actium.The scene where Antony blithely severs his connection with earth ends with thenaming of Caesar’s lieutenant, Taurus (III.vii.78). The next scene, just a fewlines long, begins with Caesar calling out to Taurus, who answers and departs,his sole appearance in the play. Shakespeare has plucked this name fromPlutarch’s roster of military officers at Actium. A Renaissance audience,familiar with simple astrology, would immediately recognize that Taurus is thefirst of the three earth signs of the zodiac. Taurus was also Shakespeare’sbirth sign. This is what Maynard Mack would call “the emblematic entrance andexit” in Shakespeare’s plays.31 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note31a] Caesar’s deputy isan earth-spirit because Antony and Cleopatra identifies Caesar with theastrological qualities of earth—patience, pragmatism, emotional reserve,discipline, application. Caesar is the reality principle, Realpolitik. Herepresents what Antony and Cleopatra have rejected, and because drama must takeplace in human space and human time, he defeats them. Psychic fixity overcomespsychic volatility. The historical Caesar was himself ruled by an earth sign.Suetonius reports that Augustus Caesar commemorated an astrological predictionof his rise to power by ordering struck “a silver coin stamped with Capricorn,the sign under which he had been born.”32 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note32a] InAntony and Cleopatra Caesar consolidates his Capricornian earth-power by bindingTaurus to him, taking away the heart of Antony’s military identity.Ancient and modern historians have been puzzled by Cleopatra’s sudden flightfrom the battle of Actium, and even more by Antony’s shameful abandonment of histroops and ships to follow her. As Shakespeare presents it, Cleopatra and theAntony whom she has infected veer off from the theater of war because of a lackof the tenacity and resolution that earth contributes to a horoscope. Cleopatrais the “fire and air” of imagination afloat upon the sea of perpetualtransformations. Fire is her fierce or fiery character of aggression andviolence. Air is her verbal energy and poetic power of image-making. Water isher uncontainable surges of emotion and her mercurial shifts of mood.Cleopatra’s personae are in constant, uncontrollable change because earth is notpresent to stabilize or set a single persona. The sea she chooses at Actium isDionysian “liquid nature,” a phrase from elsewhere in Plutarch. This is thewatery chthonian which separates her from Rosalind.Cleopatra is Egypt, and Egypt is the Nile. In the Renaissance way, Cleopatra isaddressed by the name of her realm, even by Antony. In Antony and Cleopatra, dryEgyptian earth has no inherent value. Fertility comes only when earth is subduedby water, turned to “slime and ooze” by the flooding Nile (II.vii.22). This muckis the primal swamp of Dionysian metamorphosis. The Egyptian serpent (alreadyidentified with Cleopatra) is bred from mud by the fiery sun (II.vii.26–27;I.iii.68–69). Cleopatra as Isis is Great Mother to her people. But Antony, inentering the humid Bower of Bliss of her liquid realm, loses his sense of self.He is not just a private person but a leader upon whom thousands depend. Aleader cannot live by love alone. Antony betrays his men, and he betrayshimself. The lovers’ indifference to public concerns and their exaltation ofemotion over duty are prefigured from the start in metaphors which inundate landwith water. Antony declares, “Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch / Of theranged empire fall!”—unadmirable sentiments for a Roman triumvir (I.i.33–34).Cleopatra angrily cries, “Sink Rome!” and “Melt Egypt into Nile!” (III.vii.15;II.v.78, 94). Antony and Cleopatra, obliterating earth in the waters of emotion,cannot resist the steady, inexorable pressure of earth’s representative, Caesar.The Renaissance Shakespeare knows Antony and Cleopatra are morally in the wrong,yet he projects into them the liquefied proteanism of his own artistic self.Antony, once the “pillar” of the Roman world, sees himself turning into shiftingclouds, shapes of horse, bear, lion, citadel, cliff, mountain (IV.xiv.2–14).Cleopatra has dissolved and naturalized him. Jane Harrison says of the GreekOrphics, with their persistent cloud metaphors, “Their theogony, theircosmogony, is full of vague nature-impersonations, of air and ether and Erebosand Chaos, and the whirlpool of things unborn.”33 [ch25_notes.html#ch07note33a]Orphism is anti-Olympian and hence anti-Apollonian. In Antony and Cleopatra,Apollonian Rome, with its statutory limits, sets up rational barriers to thechaotic flux of sensory experience. Antony is alchemized by Cleopatra, queen ofDionysian nature. He is hermaphroditized by his dissolution in watery Egypt.Mars drowns in Venus. At his darkest moment, Antony says to Cleopatra, “Love, Iam full of lead” (III.xi.72). This is the play’s nadir, before thetransformation begins into spiritual gold.Magic and prophecies are efficacious throughout. After his death, Cleopatra seesAntony as the astrological cosmic man, his eyes the sun and moon (V.ii.80). Thehermaphrodite rebis of alchemy was often shown as a union of Sol and Luna, sunand moon. Both Antony and Cleopatra reach perfection in death. As the incompleteMercurius, Cleopatra must achieve her magnum opus outside of life rather than init. Before her suicide, she says, “Now from head to foot / I am marble-constant:now the fleeting moon / No planet is of mine” (239–41). Cleopatra is renouncingwhat Shakespeare elsewhere calls “the wat’ry moon,” the symbol of emotionalvolatility we found in As You Like It (Midsummer II.1.162). At last she acquiresthat stony fixity of will which the play ascribes to Roman personality. Herceaseless transformations end in the immobility of death—immutable as thePhilosopher’s Stone. Death is already in her lips when she says, “I am fire, andair; my other elements / I give to baser life” (289–90). Actually, she hasfinally mastered her too-combustible fire and air and achieved a spiritualintegration of all four elements. With the addition of “marble-constant” earth,the coldness of death, Cleopatra is now the complete Mercurius, enshrined uponher altar-like bier. “Husband, I come,” she says to the dead Antony. Themedieval alchemic process was called both marriage bed and funeral bier. Thosewho have sought a redemptive pattern in Antony and Cleopatra are correct, butChristian it is not. Shakespeare ends his play with the alchemic purification ofpagan personality.The symbolic marriage of Antony and Cleopatra, enacted at the moment of death,removes the lovers from the social order. Their hedonism and self-involvementhave damaged their nations and their cause. Eight boars for breakfast is norecipe for political success. Cleopatra was the last of the Ptolemies, athree-hundred-year-old Macedonian dynasty. After her death, Egypt was annexed assubject state to Rome and never regained its former glory. Antony and Cleopatrademonstrates that life cannot be lived as a series of perpetualself-transformations without violating social and ethical principles. Mygeneration learned this the hard way, going down in sexual disease and drugoverdoses. Antony and Cleopatra takes a double point of view: Shakespeareacknowledges the eternal authority of beauty and imagination, but he rendersunto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s. Social order and stability wereprimary English Renaissance values. This is why Rosalind, unlike Cleopatra, isthe perfected Mercurius. At the end of her play, Rosalind demonstrates thesubordination of personality to society by relinquishing her theatricalandrogyny and metamorphoses for obedience in marriage. Hierarchy is restored, inhome and palace.If Rosalind is a role difficult to play, Shakespeare’s Cleopatra is even moreso. A bad Rosalind is simply simpering or flat. But a bad Cleopatra isludicrous. No one fits the part—except Tina Turner, Kent Christensen’s superbsuggestion to me. In the video of “What’s Love Got To Do With It?” Tina Turneris Shakespeare’s “tawny” Cleopatra in all her moods, regal, raffish, masculine,maternal, strolling among her people in the city streets. Cleopatra’s fierysexual expressionism is Shakespeare’s reply to the cool introversion ofSpenser’s chaste heroines. Cleopatra is Amazon and mother but also chatterbox.The silent pictorial iconicism of The Faerie Queene is part of the poem’s searchfor self-definition. Spenser turns the hard Apollonian line against his ownplush pornographic impulses. Shakespeare bases language in the Dionysian body.In all his mature plays, speech is sensory and muscular. Stage gesture andmovement are implicit in the zigzagging syntax. Every major Shakespearecharacter unites sexual personae with blooming language, while Spenser dividesthem. Nothing in literature is more majestic than the sound of a true kingspeaking in Shakespeare. The enormous assertion of that voice and the internalstability in the verse are functions of Renaissance hierarchy, overflows of thegreat chain of being. Unfortunately, the heroic Shakespearean sound is muffledthese days for scaled-down television performance or productions by liberaldirectors with antifascist axes to grind. But Shakespeare’s aristocratic voicemust be heard. It is a moral ideal. Rosalind and Cleopatra, we have seen, strainat the limits of the Renaissance hierarchic code. Shakespeare dramatizes theRenaissance tension between sexual personae and social order, one of hisprofoundest concerns. The major theme of Shakespeare’s plays ispersonality-in-history, the heart of western identity.Spenser, Shakespeare, and Freud are the three greatest sexual psychologists inliterature, continuing a tradition begun by Euripides and Ovid. Freud has norivals among his successors because they think he wrote science, when in fact hewrote art. Spenser, the Apollonian pictorialist, and Shakespeare, the Dionysianalchemist, compete for artistic control of the English Renaissance. Shakespeareunlooses his metamorphic flood of words and personae to escape Spenser’srigorous binding. Luckily, he had drama to flourish in. In this genre he couldbe free of Spenser’s strictures. The contrast between Shakespeare and Spenser isreplayed in Metaphysical poetry, the next important literary movement. JohnDonne is Shakespeare’s heir, muscular, theatrical, and metaphor-ridden. Donnefills even devout religious poems with flamboyant sexual personae and eccentrictranspositions of gender. George Herbert is Spenser’s heir. The exquisiteaestheticism of The Faerie Queene turns into feminine homoeroticism in Herbert.The silvery sweetness of Herbert’s simple style is exactly like Sappho’s. If youwant to know how Sappho sounds in Greek, don’t read her pedestrian translators;read Herbert. Herbert discourages anything abrupt or emphatic—that is,masculine. Climactic speech is often ignored, restrained, or expelled. Herbert’sworld of contemplative serenity and whispery intimacies is androgynous. Itsdivine male presences have internalized femininity, so that real women areunnecessary and de trop. Though his poems seem disarmingly open and transparent,Herbert is psychologically embowered. He is alone, under Spenserian glass.Shakespeare managed to evade Spenser, but Milton as epic poet had to meetSpenser on his own turf. Paradise Lost (1660) staggers under the burden of TheFaerie Queene. If Spenser is the English Botticelli, Milton is its Bernini.Paradise Lost is a Baroque Laocoön, strangling itself with its own statelyornateness. Though Milton uses Shakespeare’s over-spilling line, Shakespeare’sspeed is gone. The best things in Paradise Lost are pagan developments ofSpenser. The worst things are humorless Protestant sermonizing, which hasimprisoned this poem in parochial nationalism. Milton can only be read inEnglish. Translated, he withers. The pagan Spenser corrupts the Puritan Milton.Milton tries, vainly, to correct Spenser morally. But Italian pictorialism,coming partly through The Faerie Queene and partly through the most decadentpassages of the Aeneid, swamps Milton’s Protestant iconoclasm. Spenser’s radiantApollonian armouring becomes Milton’s louring metallic daemonism, militant andmisogynistic. Satan’s legions gleam with hard Spenserian light. Milton sinkswhen he sings of the foggy formlessness of good. His God is poetically impotent.But his noisy, thrashing Spenserian serpents and monsters; his lush Spenserianembowered Paradise; his evil, envious Spenserian voyeurism: these are immortal.Milton tries to defeat Spenser by wordiness, Judaic word-fetishism, tangling theApollonian eye in the labyrinth of etymology. Shakespeare succeeded here byjoining words to pagan sexual personae. But the Christian Milton is mastered bySpenser, who bounds over him and through him to Romanticism."},{"pageContent":"8RETURN OF THE GREAT MOTHERRousseau versus SadeRomanticism is the forge of modern gender. Two Renaissance principles reemerge:flamboyant androgynous sex roles and the idea of divinely inspired artisticgenius. The Renaissance, we saw, revived the Apollonian element in Greco-Romanpaganism. In Renaissance art, even Dionysian beings, like Shakespeare’sCleopatra, are subordinated to social and moral order. Romanticism swings towardApollo’s rival, Dionysus, who appears in a great wave of the chthonian. TheEnlightenment, developing Renaissance innovations in science and technology, wasruled by the Apollonian mind. Not since Greek high classicism had clarity andlogic been so promoted as intellectual and moral values, determining themathematical form of poetry, art, architecture, and music. “ORDER is Heav’n’sfirst law,” says Pope, from the cold beauty of Descartes and Newton’s mechanicaluniverse (Essay on Man, IV.49). The Enlightenment, as Peter Gay asserts, usedpagan scientism to free European culture from Judeo-Christian theology.1[ch25_notes.html#ch08note1a] Reason, not faith created the modern world. Butoverstress of any faculty causes a rebound to the other extreme. The ApollonianEnlightenment produced the counterreaction of irrationalism and daemonism whichis Romanticism.Romanticism makes a regression to the primeval, the archaic night-world defeatedand repressed by Aeschylus’ Oresteia. It brings a return of the Great Mother,the dark nature-goddess whom St. Augustine condemns as the most formidable enemyof Christianity. Turning from society toward nature, Rousseau creates theRomantic world-view. Though he allows authority to the state for public good,his most enduring bequest is the flamingly antiestablishment stance of radicalsfrom Blake and Marx to the Rolling Stones. Rousseau makes freedom a westernwatchword. Like the Renaissance, the Enlightenment glamourized hierarchy, thegreat chain of being swept away by Romanticism. For Rousseau, the SwissProtestant reformer, no hierarchy comes from nature. Politics can be reshaped byhuman will, for human benefit. Romanticism regards hierarchy as a repressivesocial fiction. But man is biologically a hierarchical animal. When onehierarchy is removed, another automatically springs up to take its place. Thegreat irony of Romanticism is that a movement predicated on freedom willcompulsively reenslave itself to imaginative orders even more fixed.Nature, hailed by Rousseau and Wordsworth as a benevolent mother, is a dangerousguest. The ancient cult-followers of Dionysus knew that subordination to natureis a crucifixion and dismemberment. Human identity is obliterated in theDionysian conversion of matter to energy, a theme of Euripides’ Bacchae.Romanticism, like the Rousseauist Swinging Sixties, misunderstands the Dionysianas the pleasure principle, when it is in fact the gross continuum ofpleasure-pain. Worshipping nature and seeking political and sexual freedom,Romanticism ends in imaginative entrammelment of every kind. Perfect freedom isintolerable and therefore impossible.Romanticism’s overexpanded superself immediately subjects itself to artificialrestraints as a chastening ascesis, a discipline and punishment. First of all,Romantic poetry invents an archaic ritual form, implicitly pagan. Second, itsteeps itself in sadomasochistic eroticism, never fully acknowledged byscholars. The sadomasochism becomes blatant in Decadent Late Romanticism, whichdefies Rousseau and Wordsworth by rejecting chthonian nature for Apollonianaestheticism. I view nineteenth-century Decadence as a Mannerist convolution ofHigh Romanticism and date it unusually early—1830. The themes I find in High andLate Romanticism—cruelty, sexual ambiguity, narcissism, fascination, obsession,vampirism, seduction, violation—are all the still-uncharted psychodynamics oferotic, artistic, and theatrical cathexis. I define American Romanticism asDecadent Late Romanticism, in the French manner. Decadence is a counterreactionwithin Romanticism, correcting its tilt toward Dionysus. This ambivalent patternis there from the start. Rousseau is savagely answered by the decadent Marquisde Sade, who stands half in the Enlightenment, half in Romanticism. Blake,Sade’s British brother, answers himself, his voices of experience devouring hisvoices of innocence. And Wordsworth is secretly answered and undermined by hiscolleague Coleridge, who through Byron and Poe turns Romanticism into Decadencein English, American, and French literature and art.Rousseau and Wordsworth, loving female nature, open the door of a closet St.Augustine locked. Out pop vampires and spirits of the night, who still stalk ourtime. We remain in the Romantic cycle initiated by Rousseau: liberal idealismcancelled by violence, barbarism, disillusion, cynicism. The French Revolution,degenerating into the bloody Reign of Terror and ending in the restoration ofmonarchy in imperial Napoleon, was the first failed Rousseauist experiment.Rousseau believes man naturally good. Evil springs from negative environmentalconditioning. Rousseau’s saintly child, marred by society, is opposed by Freud’saggressive, egomaniacal infant—whom I hear and see everywhere. But Rousseauismflourishes among today’s social workers and childcare experts, whose smooth,sunny voices too often exude piety and paternalism.In The Confessions, modelled on Augustine’s, Rousseau says a childhood incidentformed his adult sexual tastes. He is eight, beaten and inadvertently aroused bya woman of thirty. Since then, his desires have been masochistic: “To fall on myknees before a masterful mistress, to obey her commands, to have to beg for herforgiveness, have been to me the most delicate of pleasures.” In love, he ispassive; women must make the first move.2 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note2a] Rousseauends the sexual scheme of the great chain of being, where male was sovereignover female. In Romanticism, unlike the Renaissance, Amazons retain their power.Rousseau wants it both ways. Idolizing woman is natural and right, a cosmic law.On the other hand, male recessiveness is blamed on female coercion. Either way,sadomasochistic dominance and submission are inherent in Rousseauism from thestart.Rousseau feminizes the European male persona. The late eighteenth century, theAge of Sensibility, gives the ideal man a womanlike sensitivity. He isCastiglione’s courtier without athleticism or social savvy. He looks to natureand beauty with misty emotion. Rousseau makes sensibility a prelude toRomanticism. The Petrarchan lover fancied himself deliciously powerlessvis-à-vis one charismatic ice-queen. The man of feminized sensibility lacks anerotic focus. He is sufficient unto himself, savoring his own thoughts andfeelings. His narcissism evolves into Romantic solipsism, doubt about thereality of things outside the self.For Rousseau and the Romantics, the female principle is absolute. Man is asatellite in woman’s sexual orbit. Rousseau calls his first patron, Madame deWarens, “Mamma,” and she calls him “Little one.” Stendhal’s heroes will replayRousseau’s erotics of maternalism. Rousseau says of his sexual initiation by DeWarens, “I felt as if I had committed incest.” She later “compells” him to puton her dressing gown: he is transvestite priest to a goddess. Rousseau attendsthe Venetian carnival as a masked lady, then adopts Armenian robes as dailydress and busies himself making laces: “I took my cushion round with me onvisits, or worked at my door, like the women.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note3a]Rousseau absorbs femininity from women, but they cannot reciprocate. They mustremain female. He is repulsed by the flat chest of intellectual Madame d’Épinay.But the voluptuous female figure is enhanced by transvestism: Madame d’Houdetot,model for his Nouvelle Héloise, conquers Rousseau when she arrives on horsebackin men’s clothes.Rousseau’s nature-theory is grounded in sex. Worshipping nature meansworshipping woman. She is a mysterious superior force. Late in life, Rousseaulikes to let his boat drift in a Swiss lake (a scene paralleled in Wordsworth’sPrelude): “Sometimes I cried out with emotion: ‘O Nature! O my mother! I am hereunder your sole protection. Here there is no cunning and rascally man to thrusthimself between us’.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note4a] The son-lover of the GreatMother spurns his sibling rivals. For all his talk of tenderness and fraternity,Rousseau was notoriously quarrelsome, finding conspiracy and persecutioneverywhere. He constantly fought with male friends, including his benefactor,British philosopher David Hume. Rousseau’s flights from city to nature werepilgrimages purifying him of masculine contamination. He started a fashion. OnceRousseau lauded the Alps, Van den Berg says, people’s desire to see Switzerlandspread through Europe “like an epidemic”: “It was then that the Alps became atourist attraction.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note5a]Through power of imaginative projection, Rousseau imprinted European culturewith his peculiar constellation of sexual personae. The man who created modernautobiography made political science autobiographical. He was the first to claimwhat we call a sexual identity. Before the late eighteenth century, identity wasdetermined internally by moral consciousness and externally by family and socialclass. Rousseau anticipates Freud in inserting sex into the childhood drama ofcharacter development. How striking a departure this was is clear when wecompare Rousseau to his self-analytic French precursors. In his Essays (1580),Montaigne lists his sexual habits as casually as his menus or bowel movements.Sex for Montaigne is office schedule and flow chart: how often and at what timesof day does he lie with his wife? The sex act is rhetorically equivalent to histaste in wines or reluctance to use silverware (an effete Italian import).Montaigne’s identity is not shaped by sex. He is discursive intellect musing onsocial custom. Pascal’s Pensées (1670) strip away Montaigne’s cheerfulintimacies. Pascal says Montaigne talks too much of himself. In the transitionfrom Renaissance to seventeenth century, identity has become barer and moreanxious. Pascal never reflects upon his sexual identity. The supreme question isthe soul’s relation to God, or, more fearfully, the soul’s relation to auniverse without God. Sex is merely part of the earthliness impeding man’sspiritual struggles.Rousseau makes sex a master principle of western character. Psychic fluidity andambiguity, themes of Shakespeare’s transvestite comedies, enter the mainstreamof thought and behavior. Autobiography becomes apologia. The Confessions are aromance of self. Rousseau is the first to trace adult perversity to childhoodtrauma. The Christian quest for salvation is recast in erotic terms. Rousseau’sguiding female spirits are apparitions, angels, and demons. He is a pagan Moses,climbing the Alps to meet his god. Adrift in the lake, he floats in the womb ofliquid nature. The sexual revolution he wrought is evident in the emergence ofhomosexuality as a formal category. From antiquity, there were homosexual acts,honorable or dissolute depending on culture and time. Since the late nineteenthcentury, there is homosexuality, a condition of being entered after searching or“questioning,” a Rousseauist identity crisis. Modern psychology, followingRousseau, pessimistically roots sex deeper than does Judeo-Christianity, whichsubordinates sex to moral will. Our sexual “freedom” is a new enslavement toancient Necessity.Rousseau’s philosophizing of sex originates in the failure of social and moralhierarchies in the late eighteenth century. Before the Enlightenment, rigidclass stratification, however stultifying, provided a sense of community. Nowidentity, suddenly expanding, must find other means of definition. But sex is nosubstitute for metaphysics. Pascal says, “The tendency should be towards thegeneral, and the bias towards self is the beginning of all disorder, in war,politics, economics, in man’s individual body.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note6a]Sex was central to ancient mystery religions, but they had a coherent view ofomnipotent nature, both violent and benign. Rousseau, the first fabricator ofsexual identity, seeks freedom by banishing social hierarchies and worshipping auniformly benevolent nature. My theory: when political and religious authorityweakens, hierarchy reasserts itself in sex, as the archaizing phenomenon ofsadomasochism. Freedom makes new prisons. We cannot escape our life in thesefascist bodies. Rousseau’s masochistic subordination to women comes from hisoveridealization of nature and emotion. Making honey, he stings himself.One cause of Rousseau’s simplistic nature-theory: there was no Faerie Queene inFrench literature to show the dangers of nature. Consequently, Sade arose, withall his horrors, to check Rousseau’s happy hopes. Rousseau and Sade togetherequal the totality of Spenser. Spenser and Sade see the daemonism in sex andnature. The Marquis de Sade (1740–1814) is a great writer and philosopher whoseabsence from university curricula illustrates the timidity and hypocrisy of theliberal humanities. No education in the western tradition is complete withoutSade. He must be confronted, in all his ugliness. Properly read, he is funny.Satirizing Rousseau, point by point, he prefigures the theories of aggression inDarwin, Nietzsche, and Freud. Sade was prosecuted by both conservative andliberal governments and spent twenty-seven years in prison. His books werebanned at publication, but rare private editions influenced avant-garde Frenchand English writers throughout the nineteenth century. Sade’s complete survivingworks were finally published in reliable form after World War II. Frenchintellectuals embraced him as a poet-criminal in the style of Jean Genet,homosexual thief and jailbird. But Sade has made barely a dent on Americanadacemic consciousness. It is his violence far more than his sex which is sohard for liberals to accept. For Sade, sex is violence. Violence is theauthentic spirit of mother nature.Sade is a transitional figure. His aristocratic libertines belong to theeighteenth-century novel of worldliness, like Lacios’ Les Liaisons dangereuses(1782). But Sade’s emphasis upon energy, instinct, and imagination puts himsquarely in Romanticism. He is writing in the same decade as Blake, Wordsworth,and Coleridge. Extending Rousseau’s idea of sexual identity, Sade makes sex atheater of pagan action. He drives a wedge between sex and emotion. Force, notlove is the law of the universe, the highest pagan truth. Sade’s daemonic mothernature is the bloodiest goddess since Asiatic Cybele. Rousseau revives the GreatMother, but Sade restores her true ferocity. She is Darwin’s nature, red intooth and claw. Simply follow nature, Rousseau declares. Sade laughing, grimlyagrees. “Cruelty is natural,” he says in Philosophy in the Bedroom (1795). InJustine (1791), he calls nature our “common mother.” Sade’s world is ruled by afemale titan: “No, there is no God, Nature sufficeth unto herself; in no wisehath she need of an author.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note7a] The Great Mother,Sade’s supreme female character, begins and ends all.In Sade’s sacred rites, libertines flagellate, rape, and castrate their victims,then devour their bodies and drink their blood. Like Aztec priests, theyvivisect, extracting the living heart. A product of the elegant Frencharistocracy, Sade primitivizes his own culture and makes it decadent. He minglessex acts with assault and mutilation to show the latent brutality of sex. As inFreud, the sex instinct is amoral and egotistical. In Juliette (1797), answeringRousseau’s Julie, Sade says of lust, “It demands, it militates, it tyrannizes.”Sex is power. Sex and aggression so fuse that not only is sex murderous butmurder is sexual. A woman declares: “Murder is a branch of erotic activity, oneof its extravagances. The human being reaches the final paroxysm of delight onlythrough an access of rage.” The orgasm is a burst of violence, “a kind of fury”showing nature’s intention that “behavior during copulation be the same asbehavior in anger.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note8a] Freud says the infantwitnessing the primal scene of parental intercourse thinks male is woundingfemale. Sade corrects Rousseau’s map of the past: Rousseau’s eroticism wasshaped by Sadean subordination, not Rousseauist tenderness. The flagellatedeight-year-old was an initiate into Sadean cult.Sade meshes his case against Rousseau with his case against Christianity. LikeNietzsche, whom he clearly influenced, Sade attacks Christianity’s bias for theweak and outcast. By preserving the lowly, Christian pity “disrupts the naturalorder and perverts the natural law.” Dominance is the right of the strong.Against Christ and Rousseau, Sade says benevolence and “what fools callhumaneness” have “nothing to do with Nature” but are “the fruit of civilizationand fear.” The founder of Christianity was “some feeble individual,” “some punywretch.” Sade dismisses Christian charity and Rousseau’s equality and fraternityas sentimental delusions. There are no social or moral obligations for thephilosopher: “He is alone in the universe.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note9a]Because of his Romantic concentration on self, Sade’s libertines never permitlove or friendship to survive. Loyalty is a temporary pact among criminalcoconspirators.Humanity has no special status in the universe. Sade asks: “What is man? andwhat difference is there between him and other plants, between him and all theother animals of the world? None, obviously.” This is a classically Dionysianview of man’s immersion in organic nature. Judeo-Christianity elevates man abovenature, but Sade, like Darwin, assigns him to the animal kingdom, subject tonatural force. Vegetable too: man is soulless, “an absolutely material plant.”And mineral: Juliette says, “Man is in no wise Nature’s dependent; he is noteven her child; he is her froth, her precipitated residue.”10[ch25_notes.html#ch08note10a] Rousseau’s mother nature is Christian Madonna,lovingly enfolding her infant son. Sade’s mother nature is pagan cannibal, herdragon jaws dripping sperm and spittle.Since man has no privileges in Sade’s universe, human acts are “neither good norbad intrinsically.” From nature’s point of view, marital sex is no differentfrom rape. To prove human benevolence a utopian theory contradicted by reality,Sade assembles a catalog of atrocities committed by every culture in history,often in the name of religion. His anthropological syncretism, anticipatingFrazer’s, demonstrates the relativism of sexual and criminal codes.Surprisingly, Sade’s abolition of civil and divine law does not lead to anarchy.The libertines establish their own rigorous structures, the natural hierarchy ofstrong and weak, master and slave. Whether Juliette’s Sodality of the Friends ofCrime or the vast School for Libertinage in 120 Days of Sodom, Sade’s libertinesorganize themselves into autonomous social units. They issue prospectuses andstatutes, design formal architectural environments, and herd their victims intoerotic classes and subsets. Like colonies of ants, they secrete systems. Thesethings in Sade come from the Apollonian Enlightenment. As a Dionysian sexualist,Sade abolishes the great chain of being, sinking man into the continuum ofnature, but he cannot shake off the intellectual hierarchism of his age. Thelibertines’ identity precedes their cooperative clustering for debauchery.Personality in Sade is hard and impermeable—that is, Apollonian. There are nomysteries or ambiguities because nothing is left in the unconscious, whose mostperverse fantasies empty into the cold light of consciousness. In Sade,Apollonian personality is plunged into Dionysian sewage but emerges clean andintact.Sade’s libertines are often double-sexed. Soft-figured males crave passivesodomy. Dolmancé belongs to a third sex: with his “feminine manias,” thesodomite was created by nature to “diminish or minimize propagation.” Sade’sheroines are among the most potent women in literature, sister to Shakespeare’sbare-knuckles Cleopatra. Madame de Clairwil of Juliette and Madame de Saint-Angeof Philosophy in the Bedroom have extraordinary self-command and aristocraticpresence. They match the male libertines in erudition and intellectual force.Clairwil (Apollonian “clear will”) combines “Minerva” with “Venus.” Her keenglance is “too fiery to withstand.” Juliette herself, through her voluminousadventures (1,193 pages), has a captivating freshness, resilience, and masculinewillfulness. Sade’s female aggressors have Cleopatra’s power of intimidation andattack, but they enact what Cleopatra only imagines. Clairwil remarks,“Torturing males is still my favorite pastime.” Juliette admires Clairwil atplay, “when I saw her daubing her cheeks with the victim’s blood, tasting it,drinking it, when I saw her bite into his flesh and tear it away with her teeth;when I saw her rub her clitoris on the bleeding wounds she opened in thewretch.” Another exploit: “The fierce creature opens the abdomen of the boy whohas been entrusted to her, she tears out his heart and thrusts it hot into hercunt. … Clairwil sent up a howl of pleasure. ‘Juliette,’ she gasped, ‘Try it,Juliette, try it, there’s nothing to equal the sensation’.”11[ch25_notes.html#ch08note11a] Not since the Bacchae had there been so direct atranscription of daemonic experience. Sade recreates the agony and ecstasy ofancient mystery religion. His female libertines are high priestesses of savagenature, doing her work day and night.Juliette calls herself “manlike in my tastes as in my thinking.” For her firstcrime, sexual assault upon and murder of a woman pedestrian, she dons men’sclothing, the sign of her burgeoning male will. She turns Rosalind’stransvestism into an executioner’s masked ball. Noirceuil enlists Juliette fortransvestite double marriages, surpassing Nero’s. Dressed as a woman, Noirceuilmarries a man; then dressed as a man, he marries a catamite dressed as a girl.Juliette, meanwhile, dresses as a man and marries a lesbian; then dressed as awoman, she marries a lesbian dressed as a man. A sexual maze.The masculinity of Sade’s women can be anatomical. Madame de Champville of 120Days of Sodom and the beautiful nun Madame de Volmar of Juliette have three-inchclitorises. Madame Durand has an obstructed vagina and a clitoris “as long as afinger,” with which she forces sodomy on women and boys. In these ruthlesspenetrators, Sade creates a freakish new sexual persona: the female activesodomite. Sade and Baudelaire like lesbianism for its aura of the unnatural. Thefemale squanders her reproductive energy upon herself. Sade finds lesbianssuperior to other women, “more original, more intelligent, more agreeable.” Hislesbian couplings go on constantly all over Europe. The lesbian heroines imitatethe “ceaseless flux and action” of nature. Plucky Juliette contrasts with hergoody-goody sister Justine, much as Cleopatra does with shy Octavia. Everydisaster and outrage comically befall patient, humble Justine. Virtue fails;vice prospers. I think that Justine is Rousseau and that Juliette is Sade.Virtue is “inert and passive,” but nature is “motion,” “active agitation.”12[ch25_notes.html#ch08note12a] In Sade as in Spenser, pure femininity is a vacuuminto which nature’s energy violently rushes. Nature finally strikes Justine deadwith a bolt of lightning. In Sade as in Blake, energy is male. Hence Sade’sgreat heroines are masculinized by their criminal vitality.Sade’s libertines retain Apollonian intellect in nature’s surging Dionysianflux. Though Sade thinks men no different from plants, his characters contradicthim by their long unplantlike speeches. In fact, they never stop talking.Learned disquisitions go on amid orgies, as in Philosophy in the Bedroom, withits rapid seesaw between theory and praxis. Cleopatra’s stormy speeches camefrom Dionysus’ link to language—hence the logophilia of Sade’s copulators. Butthere is no Dionysian self-abandonment in Sade. Moderate delirium may occur atorgasm (Madame de Saint-Ange: “Aië! aië! aië!”), but words generally sail onthrough ejaculation. Sade’s sexual dissenters seek Dionysian lawlessness andabandon themselves to Dionysian fluids. Physiologic squalor, theme of Swift’sThe Lady’s Dressing Room, is minutely detailed in 120 Days of Sodom. Here aremore excremental interludes than in any other Sade novel, not only coprophagybut lapping up of the most obscure bodily secretions. As in Whitman, identity isexpanded and redefined by taking in life’s debris. To be sexually aroused bysomething eccentric, insignificant, or disgusting is a victory of imagination.Sade demonstrates Dionysus’ promiscuous all-inclusiveness. He makes licking andsucking mental acts. Without the great chain of being, there is no hierarchicdignity or decorum. Sade’s libertines freely wallow in filth and find nohumiliation in being flogged or sodomized in public. The excretory voiding ofone person into the mouth of another is Dionysian monologue, a pagan oratory.Sade consigns the human body to the realm of Dionysian dismemberments, scornedby Aeschylus’ Apollo as chthonian home of the Furies. The tortures invented bythe libertines are of the form-pulverizing kind I found in Homer and Euripides.The libertines eagerly obliterate the body’s formal contours, tearing, piercing,scraping, gouging, maiming, slicing, shredding, burning, melting. Readers’tolerance for Sade’s barbaric fantasies will vary. Even I cannot stand manypassages, despite my long study of the chthonian and, possibly more germane, acollege summer as ward secretary of a downtown hospital emergency room. Don’tread Sade before lunch! Sade is subjecting the body to Dionysian process,reducing the human to raw matter and feeding it back to rapacious nature.Plutarch calls Dionysus “the Many.” Sadean sex is not democratic, but it alwaysoccurs in groups. Private rooms annex the sexual arena of 120 Days of Sodom butseem merely ornamental. The libertines prefer mob-frenzy, a Bacchic rout.Dionysus’ metamorphoses are in Sade’s roiling sex-action, inventing sexualpersonae and molding the body into new shapes. Men take masochistic roles andwomen rape and torture in order to destroy traditional sexual hierarchy.Paganism is restored and the hermaphroditic world of Roman orgy recreated. Sadewants to create an androgyne as perfect monster, combining as many perverseidentities as possible. Sodomized as she rapes her mother, the ingenue Eugéniecheerfully cries, “Here I am: at one stroke incestuous, adulteress, sodomite,and all that in a girl who only lost her maidenhead today!” Fornicating with herbrother, Madame de Saint-Ange is sodomized by Dolmancé, who in turn is beingsodomized by the gardener. She declares to Eugénie, “Behold, my love, behold allthat I simultaneously do: scandal, seduction, bad example, incest, adultery,sodomy!” Eugénie, an initiate into pagan mysteries, is catechized by herpreceptress, satirizing Rousseau’s progressivist theory of education. Sadeconcocts roles and experiences with Romantic audacity. In 120 Days of Sodom, thePresident de Curval explores another variation: “In order to combine incest,adultery, sodomy, and sacrilege, he embuggers his married daughter with a Host.”Sade stirs affronts to the sacred into his stew. Again: “A notorious sodomist,in order to commit that crime with those of incest, murder, rape, sacrilege, andadultery, first inserts a Host in his ass, then has himself embuggered by hisown son, rapes his married daughter, and kills his niece.”13[ch25_notes.html#ch08note13a] The Sadean orgiast is intellectual andcontortionist, a Laocoön entwined by his proliferating desires.Sade’s sexual conglomerations are like answers to a riddle: what is black andwhite and red all over? He produces them a posteriori (!) in response to thequestion, how may I outrage as many conventions as possible? They are prisonpuzzles worked out by ingenious wit, as in the ritualistic finale of As You LikeIt, where Rosalind makes herself the solution to a sexual conundrum. But notethe difference between Renaissance and Romantic imagination. Rosalind simplifiesher superimposed sexual identities to ensure social consolidation and progress.Sade crushes identity upon identity to demolish social structure. Romanticincest, we will see, is a contraction of relationships. Incestuous inbreedingrules Sade’s sexual conglomerates.At a Naples revel, Juliette enjoys receiving “three pricks simultaneously, twoin the cunt, one in the ass”:There were several times when everybody forgathered upon a single woman. Thricedid I withstand the weight of that general assault. I was lying upon one man whowas embuggering me; Elise, squatting over my face, gave me her pretty littlecunt to suck; another man embuggered her above me, while frigging my cunt; andRaimonde was stimulating that man’s asshole with her tongue. Within reach of mytwo hands were Olympia to one side, on all fours, Clairwil to the other side: Iintroduced a prick into the asshole of each, and each of them sucked a prickbelonging to the fifth and sixth man. The six valets, after having dischargedeight times each, were finally received without difficulty.14[ch25_notes.html#ch08note14a]We see a gigantic complex sexual molecule with a female center. It is thewrithing octopus of mother nature. Sade’s multisexed hybrid is like Scylla orHydra or other chthonian horrors of Greek myth. Such grotesques in Spenser andBlake are always negative. But not in Sade, who substitutes sexual for socialrelations. His libertines swarm together in mutually exploitative units, thenbreak apart into hostile atomies. Multiplication, addition, division: Sadeperverts the Enlightenment’s Apollonian mathematic. A schoolmaster’s voice: ifsix valets discharge eight times each, how many valets does it take to … ?One of Sade’s most outlandish conjunctions occurs in a convent in Bologna.Juliette makes the unforgettable remark, “The Bolognese nun possesses the art ofcunt-sucking in a higher degree than any other female on the Europeancontinent.” Sade parodies Diderot’s magisterial style, investigating, comparing,concluding.Delicious creatures! I shall ever sing your memory…. It was there, my friends,that I executed what Italian women call the rosary: all fitted out with dildoesand gathered in a great hall, we would thread ourselves one to the next, therewould be a hundred on the chain; through those who were tall it ran by the cunt,by the ass through those who were short; an elder was placed at each novena,they were the paternoster beads and had the right to speak: they gave the signalfor discharges, directed the movements and evolutions, and presided in generalover the order of those unusual orgies.15 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note15a]A hundred nuns linked by dildos! The style of Busby Berkeley or the Radio CityRockettes. The holy rosary becomes the primeval uroboros, a vicious circle.Human connectedness is sexually literalized. The orgiast nuns are like apolysyllabic Greek or German noun, spawning prefixes and suffixes and hyphenatedby dildos. As a man of the Enlightenment, Sade organizes Dionysian experienceinto Apollonian patterns, punctuated by hierarchical speech.Sade’s Dionysian modes are multiplicity and metamorphosis. Dolmancé urgesEugénie “to multiply those excesses even to beyond the possible,” a Romanticformulation. An abbess tells Juliette, “Variety, multiplicity are the two mostpowerful vehicles of lust.” Madame de Saint-Ange explains the boudoir’s manymirrors: “By repeating our attitudes and postures in a thousand different ways,they infinitely multiply those same pleasures for the persons seated here uponthis ottoman. Thus everything is visible, no part of the body can remain hidden:everything must be seen.” Madame de Saint-Ange is voyeur and cubist, dividingthe body into parts spread across a single screen of vision. In Sade, theaggressive Apollonian eye never loses its power. He creates a night of moralitybut never of sight. Noirceuil, echoing Ovid, counsels wives, “Metamorphoseyourselves, assume many roles, play at this sex and that.”16[ch25_notes.html#ch08note16a].Dionysian metamorphosis is obvious in the transvestite and transsexual episodes.A roué wants to be spanked by “a man got up as a girl,” a “masculineflagellatrice” called “she.” The Due de Blangis, kissing a boy, is suddenlysodomized: “Virtually without noticing it, he changed sex.” Transsexualoperations are brutally improvised: “After having sheared off the boy’s prickand balls, using a red-hot iron he hollows out a cunt in the place formerlyoccupied by his genitals; the iron makes the hole and cauterizes simultaneously:he fucks the patient’s new orifice and strangles him with his hands upondischarging.” The libertines practice daemonic medicine. Another transsexualexperiment, with organ transplants: “A sodomist: rips the intestines from ayoung boy and a young girl, puts the boy’s into the girl, inserts the girl’sinto the boy’s body, stitches up the incisions, ties them back to back to apillar which supports them both, and he watches them perish.”17[ch25_notes.html#ch08note17a] Remember, these are ideas, not acts. Sade isolatesthe aggression in the western scientific mind. And he demonstrates (my constanttheme) the sexual character of western seeing. Sade plays Darwinian mothernature, mutating gender and cross-fertilizing with heavy hands. Like her, hemakes manure and loam out of humanity.So identity in Sade, as in Romanticism, comes not from society but from thedaemonized self. But Sade differs from the more passive Romantics (except Blake)in making identity arise from action, for libertine and victim alike. Oneoriginates an act, and the other suffers it. The context of Sadean identity isdramaturgical. There are always “tableaux” and “dramatic spectacles” ofinterlaced bodies, of which people make witty aesthetic judgments. Theatricalityis blatant in modern sadomasochism, with its costumes, stage props, and scripts.Sadomasochism, I suggested, is a symptom of cultural thirst for hierarchy.Religion is misguided when it relaxes its ritualism. The imagination longs forsubordination and will seek it elsewhere. Sade, a philosophe casting the churchout of his universe, ends by making sex a new religion. His lavish sexualritualism dramatizes the natural hierarchism of sex—a hierarchism having nothingto do with social custom, for women can be masters and men slaves. Sadomasochismis coldly formal, a condensed expression of the biologic structure ofsex-experience. In every orgasm there is domination or surrender, open at alltimes to both sexes, in groups, pairs, or alone. Richard Tristman remarked tome, “All sexuality entails some degree of theater.” Sex contains an element ofthe abstract and transpersonal, which only sadomasochism forthrightlyacknowledges. Tristman continued: “All sexual relations involve relations ofdominance. The desire for equality in women is probably an attenuated expressionof the desire to dominate.” Hailed in the Sixties as a sexual liberator, Sade isactually the most scholarly documenter of sex’s subjection to hierarchicalorders.The theatricality of Sade’s libertines comes from their clarity ofconsciousness. Daydreaming or introspection is unneeded in a world whererealization immediately follows desire. The libertines are like Roman emperorsin wealth and power, two things, as Sade observes, which give absolute sexualcontrol over others. Like Blake, Sade exalts Romantic imagination, the source ofwish and therefore fulfillment: “The imagination’s fire must set the furnace ofthe senses alight.” Free imagination is able “to forge, to weave, to create newfantasies.” Juliette declares, “The imagination is the only cradle wherepleasures are born.” Without it, “all that remains is the physical act, dull,gross, and brutish.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note18a] Sade’s biggest erogenouszone is the mind. His works, like Genet’s, are autoerotic prison dreams creatinga perverse universe of new sensations and sexes. Sade is the cosmogonic Khepera,eternally renewing his lust. Masturbation is his motivating principle.In 120 Days of Sodom, with its Decameron-like format, the compulsion to findfresh sexual rituals to stimulate orgasm appears in the numbered lists of thefinal sections, still in draft when the manuscript disappeared in the stormingof the Bastille. Sade invents an astonishing series of short sexual scriptsisolating the drama of subordination, fantasies stripped down to their skeletalhierarchical structure. Each has a date and number. The lists are part journal,saints’ calendar, epic catalog, Apollonian calculus.We may sense the eroticism in this, even if we fail to share its appeal: “The22nd of December. 109. He rubs a naked girl with honey, then binds her to acolumn and releases upon her a swarm of large flies.” St. Sebastian becomes theseething hive of Ephesian mother nature. Other scenarios are more puzzling. “Hasher run naked about a garden at night, the season is winter, the weatherfreezing; here and there are stretched cords upon which she trips and falls.”Or: “He holds the girl by the ears and walks her around the room, discharging ashe parades with her.” The imagery is of malice and sabotage, hunt and trophy.The girl is a flayed coney run to earth. Sade’s scripts can be disarmingly mild:“Has a woman with beautiful hair brought to him, saying he simply wishes toexamine her hair; but he cuts if off very traitorously and discharges uponseeing her melt into tears and bewail her misfortune, at which he laughsimmoderately.”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note19a] This is Spenserian masque, apublic spectacle eroticized by juxtaposing feminine vulnerability with icy,lustful hierarchic power.Sade’s precision gives his fantasies a comic gratuitousness: “He pulls out herteeth and scratches her gums with needles. Sometimes he heats the needles.” Hotneedles are the least of her problems. Sade’s self-satirizing decadent stylebelongs to an eighteenth-century fin de siècle. There are Swiftian sallies: “The17th of February 90. A bugger cooks up a little girl in a double boiler.” Thepot gleams with recipe-like professionalism. My favorite recalls Aliceintroduced to the plum pudding: “He binds the girl belly down upon a diningtable and eats a piping hot omelette served upon her buttocks. He uses anexceedingly sharp fork.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note20a] Heated needles, doubleboiler, ticklish tines: the eye is drawn in by increasing specificity of detailuntil we find ourselves poring over a grotesque scene with scientificabsorption. Sade’s epicene wit allies him with Lewis Carroll and Oscar Wilde.The lists of 120 Days of Sodom are like a roster of outrageous Wildean epigrams.The theater director of 120 Days of Sodom is male, but in Sade’s work as awhole, females are not more abused than males. Sade and Blake grant women thesexual freedom of men. Though he honors his great female libertines, Sadedetests procreative woman. Pregnant women are tortured, forced to abort, orcrushed together on iron wheels. Madame de Saint-Ange tells Eugénie, “I declareto you, I hold generation in such horror I should cease to be your friend theinstant you were to become pregnant.” Madame Delbène urges Juliette, “Do notbreed.” A statute of the Sodality of the Friends of Crime is, “True libertinageabhors progeniture.” The three major figures of Philosophy in the Bedroom detesttheir mothers. The novella ends in a ritualistic assault upon a mother, Madamede Mistival, who comes to rescue her daughter Eugénie from her corrupters.Instead, Mistival is raped, flogged, and infected vaginally and anally by asyphilitic valet. Then vagina and rectum are sewn up with “a heavy red waxedthread.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note21a] Needlework torture occurs elsewhere inSade, but nowhere so emphatically. Only here is the thread red, hinting at thearterial and umbilical. The scene looks forward to Huysmans’ archetypal dream ofmother nature, where female genitalia turn into syphilitic flower.Sade is seeking a female equivalent to castration. How does one desex a womanwithout dismembering and therefore killing her? In 120 Days of Sodom the Due deBlangis attempts such an operation, disordering a woman’s entrails by piercingthe vaginal, intestinal, and gastric walls. But in Philosophy in the BedroomSade wants to androgynize the procreative female and send her back into theworld in humiliating sterility. Similar symbolic action was at work in Jack theRipper’s extraction and public nailing up of the uterus of his victims. Isuspect Sade is a bit vague about female sexual anatomy; otherwise, he wouldsurely have splattered such impromptu hysterectomies all over his work.Mutilation of female genitals, reported to this day throughout the world,descends from ancient perceptions of the uncanniness of female fertility. Jungsays, “Occasionally it still happens that the natives in the bush kill a womanand take out her uterus, in order to make use of this organ in magical rites.”22[ch25_notes.html#ch08note22a] Such things arise not from social prejudice butfrom legitimate fear of woman’s alliance with chthonian nature.The female body is often ridiculed in Sade. Two effeminate homosexual minionsstrip Justine and laugh uproariously at her genitals: “Nothing nastier than thathole.” A man in Juliette calls female genitals an “unclean, fetid gulf.” Thefemale bosom is lustfully admired by Sade’s lesbians, but it leaves many malescold. In 120 Days of Sodom a priapic gentleman rebukes Madame Duclos: “‘Deviltake those damned tits of yours,’ he cried; ‘who asked you for tits? That’s whatI can’t bear about these creatures, every single impudent one of them is wild toshow you her miserable bubs’.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note23a] Breasts oftenappear only to be flailed and cut to ribbons—or in one case severed and fried ona griddle. But before we condemn Sade, think of Tiepolo’s painting, TheMartyrdom of Saint Agatha (1750). The saint ecstatically expires, eyes raised toheaven, while her bloody amputated breasts are collected for us by an insouciantpageboy hefting a silver platter. Are we expected to vomit or eat? For twothousand years, the torture of martyred saints, as well as of Christ, has filledwestern imagination with sadomasochistic reverie. Adolescent Yukio Mishima hadhis first orgasm upon seeing a copy of Guido Reni’s St. Sebastian. The sex andviolence in Christian iconography are an eruption of pagan mystery religion, ofwhich Christianity is a development.Sade believes the female body less beautiful than the male. Compare a naked manand woman: “You will be obliged to conclude that woman is simply man in anextraordinarily degraded form.”24 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note24a] LikeMichelangelo, Sade admires muscular articulation, the Blakean correlate of hisRomantic energy. De Beauvoir and Barthes connect Sade’s devaluation of thefemale body to his homosexual craving for sodomy.25[ch25_notes.html#ch08note25a] But sexual symbolism is greater than privatehabits. Sodomy is Sade’s rational protest against relentlessly overabundantprocreative nature. Dog-style heterosexual copulation, a staple of currentpornography, represents the animality and impersonality of sex-experience. Whenface is averted from face, emotion and society are annihilated. Remember themasked face of the Venus of Willendorf. The zippered leather mask of modernsadomasochistic gear covers the whole head and primitivizes the personality.Sodomy’s ritual significance appears in a myth recorded by Clement ofAlexandria. As a reward for directions to the underworld, Dionysus promises tosodomize Proshymnos. But when the god returns, Proshymnos is dead. To fulfillhis vow, Dionysus anally penetrates the corpse with a branch carved like apenis. Sodomy is imagined as ritual entrance to the underworld, symbolized byman’s bowels.The ritual sex acts of ancient earth-cult were meant to stimulate nature’sfertility. Sodomy in Sade blocks the procreative. Like Blake, Sade brings theGreat Mother into being as an act of hostility. The campaign against Madame deMistival begins with Dolmancé’s proclamation, “We owe absolutely nothing to ourmothers.” After Harold Bloom’s study of male poetic strife in The Anxiety ofInfluence, it is impossible to read such a statement without hearing its realmeaning: “We owe absolutely everything to our mothers.” Sade’s works ritualizesex on a gigantic scale. If a ritual relieves anxiety, Sade’s sadomasochisticinventions are modes of distancing by which male imagination tries to freeitself from female origins. Again, there are parallels with Blake. Jane Harrisonsays, “Man cannot escape being born of woman, but he can, and if he is wise,will, as soon as he comes to manhood, perform ceremonies of riddance andpurgation.”26 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note26a] Sade’s obsessive sodomy is a ritualof riddance to evade maternal power.Hence Sade alternately celebrates and reviles woman. He gives his intellectualfemale libertines another male prerogative, in defiance of reality: the passionfor sexual atrocities. Anyone can see, just by reading the newspaper, that mencommit sex-crimes and women do not. The feminist idea that sexual violence iscaused by the social denigration of women is disproved by the many cases ofhomosexual torture and rape-murder of boys by the dozen. Sex-crimes arise lessfrom environmental conditioning than from a failure of socialization. Mutilatingcrimes by women are extremely rare. There are the Papin sisters, whose massacreof their employers inspired Genet’s The Maids. After that we are at a loss,driven as far back as ax-wielding Lizzie Borden, who may have gotten a raw deal.As for what Sade calls “lust-murder” or “venereal murder”—homicide thatstimulates orgasm or is a substitute for it—I beg for female nominees. One ofhistory’s most intriguing women, Hungarian Countess Erzsebet Bathory(1560–1614), the prototypical lesbian vampire of horror films, may have beensexually aroused in her torture and murder of 610 maidens, but rumor reportsonly that she bathed in their blood to preserve her youth. As Freud says, “Womenshow little need to degrade the sexual object.”27 [ch25_notes.html#ch08note27a]Serial or sex murder, like fetishism, is a perversion of male intelligence. Itis a criminal abstraction, masculine in its deranged egotism and orderliness. Itis the asocial equivalent of philosophy, mathematics, and music. There is nofemale Mozart because there is no female Jack the Ripper. Sade has spectacularlyenlarged female character. The barbarism of Madame de Clairwil, orgasmic allyrending her victims limb from limb, is the sign of her greater conceptual power.Sade’s female sex-criminals are Belles Dames Sans Merci of early Romanticism.The Romantic femmes fatales will be silent, nocturnal, lit by their own daemonicanimal eye. But Sade’s women, inveterate talkers, retain the clear Apolloniansolar eye of western intellect.Sade’s enormous influence upon Decadent Late Romanticism has not been fullystudied. His importance is demonstrated by Mario Praz in “The Shadow of theDivine Marquis” in The Romantic Agony (1933), a major book shunned by mostcritics as simplistic and sensational. Baudelaire and Swinburne stress theirdebt to Sade, who prefigures Decadent sensibility in several ways. He findsbeauty in the horrible and revolting. Like the Roman emperors, he juxtaposesartificiality and sophistication with chthonian barbarism. His libertines are“indifferent to everything simple and commonplace,” a Decadent phrase.28[ch25_notes.html#ch08note28a] The libertines are always self-immured, a Decadentclaustrophobia. We will find a parallel in the imprisoned spaces of the Gothicnovel, which reach the Decadence through Poe. Sade’s corpse-strewn sexual arenasresemble the Gothic morgue. These heaps of rotting matter are the accumulatedobjects of nature and society which I see oppressing Romantic imagination."},{"pageContent":"9AMAZONS, MOTHERS, GHOSTSGoethe to GothicThe young Goethe, a disciple of Rousseau, begins German literaryself-consciousness in a welter of sexual ambiguities. Like Sade, Goethe is atransitional figure, half classic, half Romantic. A new Renaissance man, hesought mastery of all arts and sciences. By the end of his long life he was thecultural leader of Europe, as Voltaire had been in the eighteenth century.Biography long ago established Goethe’s sexual eccentricities and amoraltitanism of will. But too much of the vast scholarship on Goethe’s poems, plays,and novels is stultifyingly dull, paralyzed by reverence. No other writer ofthis rank suffers so gaping a rift between biography and criticism.Goethe’s novella The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774) gave the Sturm und Drangschool, with its Rousseauist sensibility, an international impact. Werther, towhom Goethe gives his own birthday, is Rousseau’s emotional feminized male,pale, melancholy, tearful. He is the moody double-sexed adolescent firstdocumented by Shakespeare. Romantic adolescence has spiritual superiority. ForWerther, childhood is beautiful and pure, while masculine adulthood is sordidand debased; so refusing to grow up is noble. Werther clings to his femininemood-states to defeat time and gender.The Sorrows of Young Werther ends in the hero’s suicide, which started a voguefor real suicides throughout Europe. This was the first salvo of Romanticyouth-cult, to return in our own frenetic 1960s. I attribute these suicides tothe shift in sexual personae at the close of the eighteenth century. TheodoreFaithfull says in another context, “Dreams of self-destruction, and probablymany cases of suicide, are desires or attempts on the part of narcissisticindividuals to give themselves a new birth by sexually attacking themselves andthus bringing about self fertilization.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note1a]Werther-style suicide had an aggressive autoeroticism, glamourizing an act thatthe Church condemns as the gravest sin. Werther’s Rousseauist emotionalism isself-dissolving: “My powers of expression are weak and everything is so hazy inmy mind that all contours seem to elude me.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note2a] TheEnlightenment’s sharp Apollonian lines disappear in Dionysian mist. Werther islike Shakespeare’s suicidal Antony, whose identity shifts like clouds. TheSorrows of Young Werther demonstrates how Rousseauist sensibility acted as analchemic bath, hermaphrodizing the European male persona in emotional fluidity.Like Rousseau, Werther worships the earth mother, in whose lap he dies. Hissuicide is strongly ritualistic: the pistols must pass through the daemonizinghands of Lotte, a pleasant maiden whom Werther turns into a Romantic femmefatale. Goethe said the novel came from “the decision to let my inner self ruleme at will” and to let outside events “penetrate.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note3a]In Romantic creativity, the male waits in spiritual passivity, acted upon byinternal and external forces. The feminized inner self is the Muse who becomesincreasingly ferocious as Romanticism goes on.Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship (1796) is a tangle of sexual problematics.Goethe’s novel begins the tradition of the Bildungsroman or novel of education,the story of a young man’s development, modelled on Rousseau’s Confessions. Afeminized male is the center of The Sorrows of Young Werther, but WilhelmMeister is dominated by masculine women. The novel opens with transvestism: anactress steps offstage in male military dress, with sword. She refuses to changeclothes, since she has a rendezvous with Wilhelm Meister, whom Goethe called his“dramatic likeness.” Like Balzac’s Sarrasine and Wilde’s Dorian Gray, Wilhelmhas fallen in love with a stage persona, whose red uniform he clasps withfetishistic “rapture.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note4a] Female transvestism iseverywhere in Wilhelm Meister, from Tasso’s warrior Clorinda to women disguisingthemselves as pages and hunter-boys.The novel has a mysterious “Amazon” who finds Wilhelm lying wounded by bandits.The shape of the radiant “angel” is concealed by a man’s white great coat, whichshe ritualistically lays upon him. This light-shedding Apollonian androgyne,suddenly appearing in a forest, resembles Spenser’s Amazon huntress Belphoebe,whose roots are in Ariosto and Tasso. Wilhelm becomes obsessed with her,replaying her epiphany in his dreams. When she becomes a real and intelligentperson at novel’s end, the Amazon loses her glamour. This pattern of declensionis common in works with sexually ambiguous themes, like Virginia Woolf’s Orlandoand Mrs. Dalloway. The Amazon’s magnetism comes only from her mysticalandrogyny. Wilhelm Meister’s transvestism is so pronounced that the heromistakes a real soldier for a woman. Another actress carries a dagger, the“faithful friend” which is her totemic male self. She kisses it and tucks it inher bosom or whips it around, cutting Wilhelm. Wilhelm Meister is not asfeminine as Werther, but Goethe swamps him sexually by surrounding him withviragos and transvestites. Wilhelm speaks for his creator in saying that “thenovel-hero” must suffer, while the dramatic hero should act and achieve.5[ch25_notes.html#ch09note5a] Even in action, like Werther’s suicide, Goethe’snovel-heroes seek self-subordination. Goethe hastens the evolution ofRousseauist sensibility into Romantic masochism.The star transvestite of Wilhelm Meister is Mignon, whom Georg Lukács calls “thevery embodiment of the romantic spirit” and Victor Lange the “most exquisiteembodiment of Romantic lyricism.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note6a] When Wilhelmfirst sees her, the adolescent Mignon is in male dress, and he cannot guess hergender. She is an “enigma” with a magical fascination for him. Her name haserotic associations: the French “mignon,” whence our “minion,” means “favorite”or “darling” in female prostitution and male homosexuality. Although she is inthe novel’s earliest manuscript, Mignon resembles a boyish Venetian acrobat whomGoethe saw in Italy in 1790. “Neither male nor female,” Mignon is fanaticalabout her transvestism. She passionately rejects female clothing: “I am a boy, Iwill be no girl!”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note7a] After playing an angel in apageant, she refuses to surrender her seraph’s robe. Two dozen pages later, sheis dead, after becoming more and more attenuated and etherealized as acharacter: she loses vital energy when she abandons male clothing. At thefuneral, her body is laid out in her winged angel’s costume. The service is amasque, with recitations by boys in Apollonian azure and silver.Mignon conforms to two categories of the androgyne. She is the beautiful boy,the Apollonian angel, but she is also a negative or afflicted Mercurius, thevolatile shape-shifter. Mignon’s early death is foreshadowed in her unnaturalexcitation. When Wilhelm meets her, she “darted like lightning through thedoor”: “She never walked up or down the stairs, but jumped. She would springalong by the railing, and before you were aware, would be sitting quietly aboveupon the landing.” She dances “lightly, nimbly, quickly.” Mignon sounds likeShakespeare’s antic Ariel, but there is something disturbingly pathological inher energy. She has palpitations and fits, a worsening “spasmodic vivacity” or“restless stillness.” She constantly twists or chews thread, napkins, paper, asif to drain “some inward violent commotion.” She is alarmingly “frantic withgayety”; hair flying, she raves and capers like a “Maenad.”8[ch25_notes.html#ch09note8a] Mignon finally falls dead from a heart spasm. TheDionysian Mercurius dances herself to death.In her emotional purity and intensity, Mignon is an early version of Faust’sEuphorion, the symbol of poetry modelled on Byron. Euphorion too is agitated andvolatile, but Mignon is more feverish and hysterical. I call her Goethe’sEuphoria, after the uncontrollable “up” phase of manic-depression. Shakespeare’sRosalind is the perfected Mercurius of mercurial wit and multiple personae. Theafflicted Mercurius is like Byron’s mistress, Lady Caroline Lamb. Sometimesappearing in pageboy or other male dress, Lady Caroline was notorious for hermad nervous energy and exhibitionistic pranks. She smashed china in her rages;she was publicly self-destructive, as when, jealous of Byron, she shattered awineglass in her hands. Byron called her “Little Mania.” Dangerous to herselfand others, she died prematurely, like Mignon. Lady Caroline was androgynous inher willfulness, transvestism, and adolescent body-type. Her excessive thinnesswent against contemporary fashion: besieged by her after his ardor had cooled,Byron declared, “I am haunted by a skeleton.”Though Mignon is more innocent than the calculating Lady Caroline Lamb, the twohave the same hyperactivity and spasmodic tension. In her mobile charm, Mignonis like Tolstoy’s mischievous Natasha, who appears once in War and Peace in amustache. In Rosalind as Mercurius, language is developed to its maximum. ButMignon is a Mercurius of silence: “Often for the whole day she was mute.”9[ch25_notes.html#ch09note9a] Even from childhood, “she could not expressherself” with words. This muteness is Mignon’s Apollonian side, which she shareswith Spenser’s Belphoebe, with her broken sentences, Melville’s stammering BillyBudd, and Thomas Mann’s dreamy Tadzio. Another afflicted Mercurius: EdieSedgwick, the short-lived blonde socialite and Andy Warhol superstar who, likeLady Caroline, was childish, boyish, angelic, monstrous, and self-destructive,constantly dancing or setting her bed and hotel afire. Next, the affectedaspiring actress Gloria (Barbara Steele) in Fellini’s 8½, wearing out her aginglover by her madcap dancing, poetic raptures, and hysterical mood-swings.Not until the end of Wilhelm Meister do we learn that Mignon was born of theincest of brother and sister. Incest, defended here, is to become the paradigmof Romantic sexuality. Mignon’s parents mentally deteriorate. An “Apparition”appears, “a beautiful boy standing at the foot of their bed and holding a bareknife.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note10a] This avenging angel of the guilt-riddenunconscious prefigures the doomed transvestite Mignon. Stationed at the bed ofsin, the boy-spirit is like Rosalind’s double, Hymen, the hoveringmarriage-idea. Mignon’s death is analogous to the Amazon’s loss of glamour whenshe regains her social identity. Like As You Like It and Twelfth Night, WilhelmMeister consigns the romance of transvestism to spiritual adolescence. Wilhelmenters maturity by renouncing the theater, arena of impersonations. For Wilhelmto advance from apprentice to master of life, the novel must sacrifice hisinseparable companion, Mignon. She is an externalization of his double-sexedadolescence. Her death is equivalent to Rosalind and Viola killing off Ganymedeand Cesario, the transvestite heroines’ male alter egos. Wilhelm’s new concernfor permanence and continuity comes from Goethe’s neoclassic side. Wilhelmbecomes “father” and “citizen.” Like Empress Plotina, he rejects multiplepersonae for the stable, unitary persona that is the basis of civic order. LikeShakespeare’s transvestite comedies (surely Goethe’s inspiration), WilheimMeister ends with the setting aside of masquerades and the rediverting ofpsychic energy into society.Goethe’s Mignon had a long and unacknowledged influence on nineteenth-centuryliterature. I think she is the source, ultimately forgotten, of a series ofRomantic and Late Romantic androgynes. An untranslated and now obscure work,Henri de Latouche’s Fragoletta (1829), takes up Wilhelm Meister’s motif offemale transvestism and transmits it to two writers strongly influenced by laTouche, Balzac and Gautier. Gautier’s Mademoiselle de Maupin, inspired byFragoletta, becomes the first bible of the French and English Decadence. In themanuscript of Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship, found early this century,Mignon’s sexual ambiguity went beyond transvestism. Goethe calls her sometimes“she,” sometimes “he,” a witty subtlety suppressed in earlier editions(including Thomas Carlyle’s still-sold translation) because it was thought anerror. In the sequel, Wilhelm Meister’s Travels, Goethe calls Mignon “boy-girl”and “pseudo-boy.” Mignon should be credited to Shakespeare’s enduringcontinental influence. Gautier rejoins the female transvestite to her source inAs You Like It, performed by his characters as a mime of their own genderconfusion.In the Venetian Epigrams, ancestor of Mann’s Death in Venice, Goethe celebratesthe Mignon-like acrobat, Bettina. He accepts as his own his novel-heroes’fascination with the perverse. Goethe sees Bettina as an incarnation of thebeautiful boys or “cherubim” of Italian Renaissance painting (Epigram 36). Hecompares her to Ganymede, whom he as king of the gods covets (38). Performing,Bettina plunges the admiring observer into dreamlike uncertainty and doubt:“Everything hovers in space in unstable form. / So Bettina confuses us, twistingher beautiful limbs” (41).11 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note11a] Bettina is sexuallyand morphologically ambiguous. Her acrobatic dexterity makes Goethe question herspecies: she is mollusk, fish, reptile, bird, human, angel (37). Mobile Bettinarepresents both Apollonian ideal beauty and Dionysian metamorphosis. Sheviolates all categories.One of the Venetian Epigrams suppressed because of their frank sexual content isabout Bettina: “What worries me most is that Bettina grows always more skillful,/ Always more supple becomes every joint in her frame; / At last she’ll bringher little tongue into her dainty slit; / She’ll play with her charming self,lose all interest in men” (34).12 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note12a] Goethe thevoyeur imagines Bettina acrobatically masturbating, like Catullus’ autofellatingsleazebag, Gellius. Bettina becomes a Romantic circle of incest and narcissism.She is the uroboros devouring itself or the Egyptian sky goddess archingbackwards. She is sexually complete and self-embowered, like Blake’s autoerotic“Sick Rose.” Visually, she resembles Blake’s engravings of solipsisticallycontorted figures. Goethe invents an autonomous, rapacious female sexuality. Heis merely a spectator at a pagan ritual. Man is on the periphery, woman at thecenter. In the next epigram, Goethe predicts Bettina’s first lover will find heracrobatics have torn her hymen. She has, in other words, the masculine power todeflower herself. Bettina is hardier and uncannier than Mignon. Her serpentinelimbs slink into and bind Goethe’s strange sexual imagination. In her flauntingexhibitionism, she is like baby mother nature at play.Faust, Goethe’s contribution to world literature, joins the Renaissance toRomanticism. Not since Hamlet, which influenced this play, had there been sosearching an analysis of the moral and sexual ambiguities of westernconsciousness. The historical Doctor Faustus was an unscrupulous magiciandenounced by his contemporary, Martin Luther. The first Faustbook (1587),condemning Faust for his intellectual hybris, shows Protestantism awakenedagainst the dangers of Renaissance paganism. Goethe expands the sexualcommentary in the Faust story. The western mind is seen as sex and power,striving against God and nature. Don Juan and Faust are the most characteristicmyths of the postclassical west. They represent dominance, aggression, thewill-to-power, all the imperial ambitions of paganism that Christianity hasnever been able to defeat.Faust is Goethe, the artist as magus, just as Mephistopheles is Goethe, theartist as enemy of God. As a Renaissance alchemist, Faust seeks the secrets ofnature. What Goethe has added to the story is the seduction theme, borrowed fromDon Juan and Casanova. In Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus (1593), Helen of Troy,summoned for Faust’s delectation, is a majestic love goddess. Goethe’sOphelia-like Gretchen, on the other hand, is the humble handmaiden in a saga oflust, violation, guilt, and remorse. Goethe makes an analogy between theexploitation of women by men and the exploitation of nature by theself-infatuated western mind. Here Goethe parallels Blake, who is the first toprotest against the industrial corruption and pollution of green England.Faust shows sex as a mode of western knowledge and control. Gretchen, thelamblike feminine innocent, is physically and morally ruined, ending ininfanticide. Her illicit intercourse with Faust implants her with westernaggression. Seduction is an intellectual game. It is the invasion of onehierarchy by another. By creating sacred spaces apart from nature, the westinvites their despoilment. Like Spenser’s Florimell, Gretchen inducesdestruction by her own passivity and defenselessness. Goethe exalts the feminineprinciple and makes Gretchen a redeemed martyr, but like all great artists he isambivalent toward his own moral constructions. Faust in league withMephistopheles is Goethe yielding to his own cannibal impulses.The west’s will-to-power has created our perverse dynamics of willing. Therapist says, she wanted it, she asked for it. This conviction is produced by theseparation and tension between sexual personae. She who may or may not ask forit is a real person, with a sharp identity. The defeat of her will is part ofthe thrill of seduction or rape. Coercion requires free will, in both homosexualand heterosexual acts. Faust’s seduction of Gretchen is intrusion, trespass,criminal entry into posted space. This is one of the west’s premiere sexualtropes, intensified by our categorizations and hierarchic rankings. In classicalantiquity, immoderate lust was priapism, which was, like drunkenness, the faultof fools and satyrs. Christianity’s animus against sex and its stark polarity ofgood versus evil intellectualized lust and raised its significance. Lust is acrossing of the gap between western sexual personae. Lust sharpens theaggressive, predatory western eye, making it prelude and coda of touch. Faustand Mephistopheles, watching, are voyeurs at Gretchen’s stalking, capture,soiling, and imprisonment.Faust, a play with an alchemist hero, has a diffuse alchemical form. It has twoparts, a multitude of episodes, and a crowd of minor characters. It combinesclassical with Christian culture. It mixes tragedy with comedy, epic with lyric,ideal beauty with the grotesque and obscene. Gretchen is naive sentiment,Mephistopheles cynical sophistication. Faust is caught in the middle, like allmankind. Faust has a variety of sexual personae, more than any other work ofmajor literature. Goethe inserts Romantic androgynes into the traditional Fauststory. Faust’s acquisitive western intellect is invaded by hybrid sexual forms,bursting out of the alchemic unconscious. All of Faust is a Walpurgisnacht, areturn of the occult. The witch-revel episode, Goethe’s addition, is a paganencroachment upon a Christian drama. Goethe identified imagination with thedaemonic: he repeatedly spoke of daemonic assaults upon gifted men. Faust isstructurally amorphous because it is daemon-haunted. The play itself suffersDionysian fluctuations: metamorphosis was the master principle of Goethe’sspeculations in science and art. Critics comment on his inability or refusal tofinish anything. All Goethe’s stories, even Werther and Wilhelm Meister, were tocontinue in sequels. As a drama, Faust breaks Aristotle’s and Racine’sApollonian rules. It is restless, volatile, glutted with magic epiphanies andcontradictory emotional textures.The two characters in Faust symbolizing poetry are double-sexed. The girlish BoyCharioteer is fancily decked out with jewels and tinsel. Euphorion, Faust andHelen’s son, is a classic beautiful boy, part Apollo, part Icarus. He wearsfeminine adornments of Asiatic opulence. Like Homer’s Athena, he is theandrogyne as symbol of human intelligence. Poetry, Goethe implies, attainsuniversality by a fusion of genders. To be transsexual in appeal, art must bebisexual in origin. Euphorion is short-lived because he represents Romanticlyricism, which burns hot and fast. Goethe joins the vernality of the Greekbeautiful boy to the true facts of English Romanticism, whose second generationof poets died glamourously young.The Adonis-like Paris is a maturer Euphorion. Goethe’s Paris is even moreeffeminate than Homer’s. Goethe suggests that femininity in a male alienates menbut arouses women. Thus the unmanly Paris won the most beautiful woman in theworld. Other examples of the languid boudoir manner are Byron’s Don Juan andGeorge Hamilton, Hollywood’s most popular escort of famous women. The mandiscreetly attending women becomes a misty mirror of their femininity.There are two sex changes in Faust. Mephistopheles slips into the shape offemale Phorkyas. Now a smooth courtier, Mephistopheles can call on chthonianmetamorphosis at will—the realm he came from when he began his interventionistcareer as a serpent trailing after a woman. The second example occurs at acarnival, where the Scraggy One, a parodie Teiresias, identifies himself as amiser whose sex has waned from female to male. Like Dante and Spenser, Goetheidentifies the female principle with emotional generosity. The Scraggy One is agargoyle, spiritually contracted, the androgyne as moral monstrosity.An alchemical experiment is performed in the second part of Faust. Homunculus, afabricated being, hovers in its glass retort, a self-propelled bubble. Goetheconsidered giving Homunculus a Homuncula as a mate, but his efforts to bringthem together failed. Presumably Homunculus, as double-sexed as the alchemicrebis, rebuffed a wife as redundant. Faust shows the creative process asalchemic. The glass jar is the lucid self-contained world of art, harboring bothbeauty and deformity. As a creative symbol, Homunculus is goblin-twin toEuphorion and the Boy Charioteer. As a specimen of bioengineering, Homunculusanticipates Mary Shelley’s creature in Frankenstein and her husband’sHermaphrodite in The Witch of Atlas. Manufacture becomes a metaphor for theaggressions of Romantic imagination.Faust’s most imposing androgynes occupy an eerie netherworld beyond space andtime. Mephistopheles, uneasy, calls them “the Mothers.” They are blind goddessesin a murky barren zone lit by a glowing Delphic tripod. The Mothers are GreekFates combined with Plato’s eternal forms: “Formation, Transformation, / EternalMind’s eternal recreation.”13 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note13a] Mephistopheles takesFaust to the omphalos of the universe, a female heart of darkness. The Mothersare nature’s brute force of metamorphosis. Their creative solipsism is adaemonized version of Bettina’s autoerotic circularity. Faust’s descent to theunderworld shows past, present, and future. The realm of the Mothers isrepressed pagan nature, which Enlightenment science failed to illuminate.Romanticism reverses the moral values of day and night. Mephistopheles himselfhails from “Mother Night,” Clytemnestra’s home.Certain Cretan nymphs were called “the mothers,” mentioned by Diodorus Siculusas “the Cretan nurses of Zeus.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note14a] Goethe’sfamiliarity with classical arcana is shown by his use of the name Baubo for oneof Faust’s witches: Baubo is an ancient totem of ritual exhibitionism, raisingher skirt to show her genitals. Goethe’s goddesses are the Great Mother cloningherself, as profuse as the many breasts of Ephesian Artemis or the thousandnames of Isis. The Mothers’ multiplicity is sinister and suffocating. They flocklike Sirens or Harpies, but they are far vaster in power. Goethe’s maternallimbo is unparalleled, though it takes its tone from the witch scenes ofMacbeth. In modern times, even when the Great Mother is treated sympathetically,as she is by Joyce and Woolf, she controls only green nature, not this gloomyStygian cavern with which western myth associates swarthy male hierarchs.Emptiness and barrenness are usually produced by a flight from the maternal, asin the refusal to mourn the dead mother in Camus’ The Stranger or in the horrorof the mucoid object-world in Sartre’s Nausea. Wasteland vision denies orsuppresses the mother. In Faust, however, barrenness and fertility are creepilysimultaneous. Goethe honors female power, but he sees it blocking everything.All roads lead to maternal darkness.The Mothers appear in Faust when the hero tries to materialize the spirit ofHelen. Adult love is overshadowed by maternal claims to priority. The malestruggles through his sexual stages, returning to the mother even when he thinkshimself most free of her. Faust finds his way to the Mothers with a key thatphallically swells. When key and tripod touch, they stick. Now Faust is able toconjure up alluring Helen. If the mother-realm is the unconscious, key andvulval tripod are the self-fecundation of imagination. The Mothers as eternalforms (“Gestalten”) are the archetypes tapped by the artist in his quest forideal beauty, the elusive Helen. The male artist descending to the Mothers makesa journey to terra incognita, his own repressed feminine side, where his motherstill dwells.In key drawn to tripod, Goethe shows the ambivalent compulsions of sexualintercourse. Every male copulating with a woman returns to his origins in thewomb. Goethe postponed intercourse until he was forty. This must be related tohis self-imposed distance from his forceful mother. To refuse phallicpenetration is to refuse surrender to the female matrix. Goethe was at leastseventy-two when he wrote the Mothers episode. Therefore it represents aconfrontation and perhaps reconciliation with a mode of experience he had castout of his youthful imaginative life. Faust shudders at the Mothers’ name. Theyare uncanny, archaic, and inescapable. Freud says that the uncanny (unheimlich)is really the familiar, the homely (heimlich) which one cannot bear torecognize. The strangeness of Goethe’s Mothers comes from their perpetualproximity. We live with them. The simplistic sexual pattern of Part One ofFaust, where the virile hero feeds upon the fragile femininity of Gretchen, isan evasion of the grosser truths faced by Part Two in the Mothers. Faust has anappetite for quivering Gretchen. But the Mothers have an appetite for quiveringFaust. He is Everyman frozen before his maker.Faust’s angelic and infernal androgynes were produced by an imagination bothfascinated and repelled by the mystery of sex. In his study of biologicalmorphology, Goethe says the scientist must remain “just as mobile and pliant” asnature herself. Goethe counsels receptivity and subordination but finds themintolerable. After a sickly childhood, he undertook a vigorous exercise programto increase his strength: he seized masculinity by force of will. Goethe’senergy in old age was legendary. Deceased contemporaries were the subject ofcondescending remarks. Goethe seemed to feel he had a superhuman power to holddeath at bay. Thomas Mann says there was something “brutal” and “heathenish” in“the arrogant way Goethe sometimes boasted of his vitality, hisindestructibility.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note15a] Goethe turned hisvulnerability to mother and nature into imperious mastery of knowledge and othermen. His principal relationship was with his sister Cornelia, a year younger andhis only real childhood friend. His imaginative connection to her was likeTennessee Williams’ to his mad sister, Rose. In his memoirs, Goethe speaks ofCornelia as his twin. She was his Romantic alter ego, what Jung would call hisanima, a sister-Muse. Cornelia died at twenty-six, soon after her marriage. Didshe fail after separation from her twin? Goethe’s sister-fixation is evidentthroughout his love affairs. In letters and poems he uses the word “sister” forlover or wife. Goethe’s many androgynes may represent a condensed incestuoustwinship.A sister is a woman who is not the mother. Goethe would not allow his mother’sname to be spoken in his presence. He avoided her. He refused to answerquestions about the episode of the Mothers. Goethe’s mother was too strong apersonality. He feared to come near her lest he be reabsorbed into hergravitational field and returned to childhood dependency. Goethe’s biographersays, “Most of his relations with women ended in sexual renunciation.”16[ch25_notes.html#ch09note16a] Heterosexuality for men will always carry thedanger of loss of identity. Goethe, unlike Antaeus, gained strength by nottouching mother earth.Wilhelm Meister’s transvestism echoes an incident just before Goethe began TheSorrows of Young Werther. The source of this story is his own mother. Goetheinvited her and her friends to watch him skate on a frozen river. His motherwore a long red fur cloak trimmed with gold. Goethe demanded the garment, put iton, and skated away—leaving her astonished and bewildered. Old engravings of thescene appear in popular articles about Goethe. K. R. Eissler says: “It is mostremarkable that the greatest German poet, one week before he set out to writehis greatest novel, felt the impulse on the spur of the moment to exhibithimself to his mother and a large crowd dressed in a conspicuous piece of femaleclothing.”17 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note17a] Theft and expropriation. Artists takewhat they want and need. Goethe plays rude Baubo with the Great Mother. He makesaggression and mockery an open-air pagan theater.Freud thinks the fetishist’s fur and velvet are symbolic substitutes for themother’s pubic hair.18 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note18a] Masoch’s Venus in Furs(1870) seems to support this. Goethe lures his mother into an arena ofhierarchic as sault. The frozen river is his own unnatural coldness to her: thisice is Dante’s pit, where fathers eat their children. Generations are at war,striving for dominance. Like Prometheus, Goethe steals the red flame of the oldorder. He wrests the vatic mantle from his mother, claiming for himself theDelphic power to give birth to Werther. Harold Bloom says, “A strong poet… mustdivine or invent himself, and so attempt the impossibility of originatinghimself.”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note19a] Goethe forces a public ritual ofself-origination. Jesus’ career begins at Cana, where he harshly tells Mary,“Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come” (John 2:4).Goethe on the frozen river says to his mother, my hour is come, and I take fromyou what I need to give birth to myself. The midwives stand gaping on the banks,spurned and useless. Remus, leaping his brother Romulus’ wall, meant to breakits magic, as by rape. Plutarch reports that Julius Caesar, the night before hecrossed the Rubicon, dreamed he had sexual relations with this mother. Goethetoo crosses a river and rapes his motherland. Attack and retreat: a declarationof imaginative independence. Henceforth, Goethe will be defiantly separate fromhis formidable mother. He steals the Palladium, the cultic Athena, which bringsdown Troy. Formerly under his mother’s aegis, he now wears it. He istransvestite son to a vanquished Amazon goddess. For another artist, turningfrom the mother might mean a withering of feeling, a creative stunting. ButGoethe instinctively reoriented himself toward his sister-spirit, borrowing herpurified femininity. Together they would rule his new inner world, twinPtolemies of self-orphaning Romanticism.Goethe used transsexual analogies to describe his creative process, referring tohimself as a pregnant woman. He spoke of being “suddenly overwhelmed” by hispoems, which forced themselves upon him fully formed. Artistically, he feltfeminine and passive toward a superior power, an idea we will find inWordsworth, Shelley, and Keats. Recollections of Goethe often use sexuallyambiguous terminology. Schiller, for example, said, “I look on him as a haughtyprudish woman whom one wants to get with child.” Goethe called his intimacy withKarl August, Duke of Weimar a “marriage.” The two even slept in the same room.In the period of his Bettina poetry, Goethe admits to homosexual feelings. Asuppressed Venetian epigram declares, “I’m fairly fond of boys, but mypreference is girls; / When I have enough of a girl, she serves me still as aboy” (40).20 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note20a] Sodomy unexpectedly rears its head atthe end of Faust, when the hero’s soul escapes because Mephistopheles isdistracted by the angels’ physical attractions. Are Wilhelm Meister’s femaletransvestites and girl-boy Mignon sexually transformed males?Goethe, who repeatedly compared himself to Voltaire’s Mambre, eunuch philosopherto Pharaoh, was a castrate priest declining to worship his goddess. The ice uponwhich he tauntingly skated hardened and externalized the chthonian swampiness ofsex and mother love. Late in life he said, “The sexual act destroys beauty, butnothing is more beautiful than what precedes this moment. Only in ancient art iseternal youth captured and depicted. And what does eternal youth mean other thannever to have known a man or a woman.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note21a] Sexdestroys beauty: Dionysus subverts the Apollonian eye. Romantic Goethecontinually seduced classical Goethe. In the Wincklemann way, Goethe thought themale body more beautiful than the female. There may be less homosexuality inthis than Apollonian idealization, the high articulation of the eye, oftenaccompanied by chastity. Goethe was heroically self-contained andself-sufficient. Like Beethoven, he married himself.Goethe’s androgynes are fitting symbols for his life work, with its titanicall-inclusiveness. Sex for Goethe is a gathering in, not a dissemination. Heclaimed there was no vice or crime of which he could not find a trace inhimself. Romantic art is self-exploratory, self-arousing, self-maiming. Goethesaid, “Geniuses experience a second adolescence, whereas other people are onlyyoung once.” Goethe retained his access to both sexes by renewing and prolongingpuberty, in which gender fluctuates. Romanticism once seemed to make largesimple gestures of rebellion. But we barely begin to understand its chargedsexual complexities and archaic pagan ritualism.Decadence is inherent in Romanticism. Sadomasochism, we have seen, is alreadypresent in Romantic eroticism from its first formulation by Rousseau. As thehistorical rhythm of Romanticism moves forward, the organic logic of artisticstyle takes over. The late phase of Romantic style is luridly Hellenistic orMannerist: distortion of form, sadomasochistic fantasy, and psychologicalclosure. Our first example is Heinrich von Kleist (1777–1811), a poet of thelate phase of German Romanticism. What Goethe dreamed about through Werther,Kleist put into action. Kleist obsessively meditated upon and ritualisticallyplanned his suicide, which he succeeded in at age thirty-four. Goethe had madesuicide poetic and erotic. Kleist, the perfect masochist, allowed dominantGoethe to write a grisly life-poem through him.Kleist’s play, Penthesilea (1808), illustrates the daemonic sensationalism ofGerman Late Romanticism. It reverses the hierarchy of sexual personae in theGreek legend of Achilles and Penthesilea. Instead of Achilles killing the Amazonqueen, she kills him. Kleist’s militant Amazons have tremendous chthonianferocity. Epic similes compare Penthesilea to a she-wolf, a raging torrent, astorm wind, a thunderbolt. When the normally Apollonian Amazon enters drama,there is an eruption of Dionysian violence. Spenser defeats the surly AmazonRadigund, but Kleist exalts her. In Romanticism, nature, not society rules. InPenthesilea woman, as conduit of the natural, obliterates manhood and history.The design of Kleist’s play is sadomasochistic oscillation. Achilles andPenthesilea try to dominate each other physically and psychologically. Eachsurge of assertion is followed by relapse, a hypnotic longing for sexualsubmission. Achilles and Penthesilea manage to capture each other a ludicrousnumber of times: Kleist’s anarchic plot line reflects the ambiguities andcontradictions in heterosexuality. Sadistic Penthesilea is aroused bymasochistic fantasies in which her dead body is battered, degraded, anddiscarded. I hear the influence of Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra here, asalso in Kleist’s images of land submerged in water, the public persona drownedin erotic obsession.Kleist’s Achilles, unlike Homer’s, wants to lose. Three times he casts awaysword and shield. He walks to his death in somnambulistic trance, seekingenslavement to Penthesilea, who falls upon him with her dogs. The play suddenlyascribes a feminine softness to Achilles. As he turns his neck, it is pierced byPenthesilea’s arrow. Neck-turning or neck-exposing is a classically femininegesture, with parallels of animal surrender. I find it in Michelangelo’sGiuliano de’ Medici, portraits of Byron, Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, and GeorgeEliot’s vain Rosamond Lydgate. In Kleist, Achilles’ feminine neck is hisAchilles’ heel, phallically penetrated by the Amazon. She and her dogs go intochthonian furor, savagely ripping off Achilles’ armour and sinking their teethinto his chest. Penthesilea locks onto his left breast, blood dripping from hermouth. Later she laments she “ravaged” Achilles by breaking through the“snow-white alabaster wall” of his breast.22 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note22a] Herassault is masculine violation of feminine virginity. The rape focuses onbreasts rather than genitals. Achilles seems to give suck to his beloved and herdogs, his breasts flowing with gore rather than milk. Kleist invents a gruesomeversion of the androgyne I call Teiresias, the nurturant male. He is injectingSade’s nature into Rousseau’s tender mother-relations.Penthesilea, a Romantic vampire, drains her victim, body and soul. Is Achilles’pierced breast an example of Freud’s “displacement upwards” from the genitals?So Penthesilea castrates. The rape-like devouring of a penis disguised as abreast appears in Bob Dylan’s brilliant invective, “Ballad of a Thin Man,” wherea sadistic voice attacks the naive Mr. Jones with the homosexual demand, “You’rea cow! Give me some milk or else go home!” Kleist’s Achilles and Dylan’s Mr.Jones enter and misread a menacing sexual scene. Both are punished for theirmisreading by compulsory feminization. Teiresias too turns female afterstumbling on a chthonian scene. Voracious Penthesilea sinks to the level of herdogs. Dogs suckling a human breast reverse the image of Romulus and Remus nursedby the she-wolf (for which Eliade finds parallels in Central Asia). Multiplenursing is usually animalistic, an exception being Daumier’s allegorical TheRepublic. Achilles’ death is a primitive, barbaric spectacle. Michelangelo’sGiuliano similarly combines a feminine neck with sadistically pierced breasts.In Kleist, however, there is a thrashing violence, Hellenistic storm and stress.Amazon and dogs in feeding frenzy fuse with and hybridize Achilles’ body, ahorrific mutilation-through-accretion recalling the grotesque deaths ofEuripides’ Medea, where princess and king stick and burn like tar. Latephase artdisfigures the human form.Phallus as breast: one explanation, as we saw, for the penile or canine breastsof the Ephesian Artemis was that Amazons hung the idol with gift strings oftheir amputated breasts. Attacking Achilles’ chest, Penthesilea is not onlydesexing him but making him an Amazon, a version of herself. She is a sadisticerotic mastectomist. All Romantic femmes fatales are avatars of daemonic mothernature. Kleist’s Amazon is a hermaphrodite deity rewriting Genesis. She hurlsAdam’s rib back through his Adam’s apple, then mutilates his rib cage withouthealing it. Like Jehovah, she makes man in her own image. The dying Achilles isnow her twin, her Romantic sister-spirit.Kleist dwells on the Amazons’ amputated breasts throughout the play. Greekartists, we saw, never showed the Amazon’s body as maimed. The Late RomanticKleist, on the other hand, makes the detail central. Nowhere else in literatureor art, not even in Sade, is so much made of breast amputation. Kleist’s hero isfetishistically aroused by a woman’s mutilating masculinization. He presses hisface to Penthesilea’s breast with a rush of endearments. Decadence is a style ofexcess and extravagance which approaches self-parody. It operaticizes byoverliteralizing. Hence one laughs even when shocked or repelled, as in Sade.Kleist’s stage directions are also parodic. This one, for example, rivalsShakespeare’s “Exit, pursued by a bear”: “Penthesilea looks round as if for achair. The Amazons roll up a stone.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note23a] It waspresumably the decadent elements in Penthesilea that led Goethe to condemn it as“unplayable.”As a classical saga of the erotic destruction of male by female, Penthesileaprefigures Swinburne’s verse-play Atalanta in Calydon. Kleist and Swinburneidentify kissing with biting, sex with appetite and cannibalism. Achilles’macabre murder resembles the narrated climax of Tennessee Williams’ SuddenlyLast Summer, where the epicene Sebastian Venable is torn to pieces and eaten bya mob of boys he has solicited. Penthesilea’s maniacal ecstasy comes fromEuripides’ Agave, who dismembers her son in the Bacchae. Penthesilea raves,foams at the mouth, hurls boulders, tears Achilles’ body limb from limb. Shelongs to root up sky and planets, to drag down the sun “by his flaming goldenhair,” to pile mountain on mountain. Dionysian vision is disordering andanti-hierarchical. In “Voodoo Child,” Jimi Hendrix aspires with drug-inducedtitanism: “I stand up next to a mountain, and I chop it down with the edge of myhand.” Shamanistic peaking is aggressive and self-destructive. Space istraversed, transcended, exploded. Penthesilea’s expansion of self through theinflux of primeval force is so overwhelming that she begins to devour all otherselves. Kleist reshapes classical legend into a parable of Romantic solipsism.Penthesilea’s ritualistic oscillations between sadism and masochism are uniquein Romanticism. In Poe, for example, the sadomasochistic relations of male andfemale personae are relatively stable and mappable. But Penthesilea is aswirling vortex of sadomasochistic passions, each savagely devouring the next.Welcome to Late Romantic nature, created by Rousseau’s benign overidealizations.Penthesilea can be read allegorically, as a descent into the poet’s unconscious,where two parts of the psyche, masculine and feminine, fight for supremacy.The play’s sexual personae have indeterminate boundaries, which are correctedand hardened by emotional, physical, and sexual assault. Penthesilea’s dangerousexpansion of self has historical causes. The failure of traditional hierarchiesin the late eighteenth century removed social and philosophical limitationsessential for happiness, security, and self-knowledge. Without externalrestrictions, there can be no self-definition. The dissolution of hierarchicalorders permitted personality to expand so suddenly that it went into a free fallof anxiety. Hence the self had to be chastened, its boundaries redefined, evenby pain. The self must be reduced in size. This is the ultimate meaning ofPenthesilea’s erotics of mastectomy. Romanticism, swelling, contracts itself inDecadence. Mutilations and amputations belong to an aesthetics of subtraction, apathological metaphysic in which the imagination reorients itself to the worldby a surgical reduction of self. Sadomasochism will always appear in the freesttimes, in imperial Rome or the late twentieth century. It is a pagan ritual ofriddance, stilling anxiety and fear.Kleist’s Achilles, lying in streams of blood under a pack of dogs, is glamourouswith masochistic ecstasy. Dying, he touches Penthesilea’s cheek: “O my bride, isthis / The festival of roses that you promised?” (To which she should reply, ifshe could get her teeth out of his chest, “I never promised you a rose garden.”)Late Romantics love the climactic pietà, starring what I call the male heroine.Woman cradles the victim, but only after she has batted him down and crushedhim. The romance of the male heroine is a dream of disordered receptivity, inwhich there is a transsexual impulse. I find a parallel symbolism in afringe-group homosexual practice that appeared in the 1970s: “fist-fucking,”whose devotees crave anal penetration by a male arm, greased by Crisco, up tothe elbow. Proctologists warned about internal damage they were repairing, firstsign of the cycle of excess that led to AIDS. Ten years ago, I was deeplyimpressed by an early pornographic film I saw of these activities. It had thesolemnity and gloom of a pagan ritual, like the tableaux of Pompeii’s Villa ofthe Mysteries. Sex as crucifixion and torture. Fist-fucking, in its starklydepersonalized conflation of voluntary rape and primitive exploratory surgery,dramatizes the daemonism of the sexual imagination, untouched by five thousandyears of civilization. My amazement never ceases at the biological conceptualismin male sexuality. What woman could invent such compulsive structures? Whatwoman, unpaid, would live and love in so hellish an underworld?The life of Heinrich von Kleist reveals the sexual conflicts that inspiredPenthesilea. Kleist’s failure to follow family military tradition was severelycensured. Literature was an unsuitable and unserious vocation. Kleist’s suicide,by pistol in the mouth (like Hemingway’s shotgun), expresses his martyrdom toTeutonic masculinity. Guns in the mouth may also suggest something notimmediately apparent in Penthesilea: repressed and therefore destructivehomosexual desire. Kleist tried to persuade his friends to a double suicidepact, and one finally agreed. Kleist spoke erotically of the anticipated eventas “the most glorious and sensual of deaths.”24 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note24a]A Romantic solipsist is in inevitable intimacy with a sister, in this caseKleist’s half-sister Ulrike, who he said had “nothing of her sex but the hips.”He longed to live with her, in Romantic union. Is she the model for Penthesilea?Many scholars note the recurrence of ideas, images, and phraseology in Kleist’swork. Walter Silz says, “Kleist is the most persistent self-plagiarist in Germanliterature.”25 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note25a] Self-plagiarism is incest andautoeroticism, the uroboros of Goethe’s Bettina. It is the self-devouring styleof the sadomasochistic Penthesilea. Kleist’s turn toward his sister was towardhis missing sexual component, but he was feminine and she masculine. She was thehe which he needed. Kleist’s Romantic family romance produced the defiant Amazonmanifesto of Penthesilea, which rings with modernity. Women have rarely spokenso boldly for themselves as Kleist speaks for them here.Sade’s reaction against Rousseau was sweeping and systematic, but it wascensored and thus not absorbed into French literature until long afterward. TheEnglish reaction against Rousseau took assimilable form: the Gothic novel.Because English literature had the archetypal precedents of The Faerie Queeneand Paradise Lost, English Romanticism from the start had a daemonic intensitythat French Romanticism took forty more years to acquire. English Gothicism ofthe 1790s is equivalent to the medieval alchemy and occultism in Faust, whichGoethe was working on at the time. Gothic darkness and roughness oppose theApollonian Enlightenment’s light, contour, and symmetry. Protestant rationalismis defeated by Gothic’s return to the ritualism and mysticism of medievalCatholicism, with its residual paganism. Art withdraws into caverns, castles,prison-cells, tombs, coffins. Gothic is a style of claustrophobic sensuality.Its closed spaces are daemonic wombs. The Gothic novel is sexually archaic: itwithdraws into chthonian darkness, the realm of Goethe’s Mothers. Mother nightpervades Romanticism, from Coleridge and Keats to Poe and Chopin with hisbrooding nocturnes. The ghosts released by Gothic will stalk through thenineteenth century as spiritualism, whose séances continue today in GreatBritain.The Gothic tradition was begun by Ann Radcliffe, a rare example of a womancreating an artistic style. The Gothic novel with the greatest impact onRomanticism, however, was Matthew G. Lewis’ The Monk (1796). Lewis, a friend ofByron, influenced all the English Romantic poets as well as Hoffmann, Scott,Poe, Hawthorne, and Emily Brontë. The Monk’s medieval monastery is a sequesteredChristian space which Lewis, like Sade, defiles with pagan eroticism. As we sawin Spenser, illicitness increases the pleasure of sexual transgression.Reviewing The Monk, Coleridge praised its “libidinous minuteness.”26[ch25_notes.html#ch09note26a] Lewis’ hero, the abbot Ambrosio, discovers hisfellow monk Rosario is actually Matilda, a woman in disguise. Lewis withholdsMatilda’s identity in the Spenserian manner, speaking of her up to this point as“he.” Matilda tears open her habit and rests a dagger on her left breast, lit bymoonbeams. Fin-de-siècle Gothic has a decadent sensationalism. Lewis’ eroticchiaroscuro juxtaposes lust with chastity, exhibitionism with voyeurism. DoesMatilda point with the dagger to inflame or mutilate herself? to direct andsharpen our aggressive western eye? Her transvestism is the mildest of herperversities. Only Coleridge’s Christabel surpasses The Monk in its pornographicexploitation of Christian moralism.Matilda is sexually divided. She insists on retaining her male name as an eroticaid. After she seduces the monk, she oddly becomes more masculine instead ofmore feminine. She seems to grow in mental power, prefiguring Poe’s Ligeia.Lewis implies Matilda’s gender is in flux: a self-adjusting mechanism maintainsher hermaphroditism, like water seeking its own level. Ambrosio’s homoeroticlonging for the vanished Rosario shows his preference for a feminine pseudo-maleover a sexually available masculine woman. But the startling last pages of TheMonk force us to reread. Lucifer, come to claim Ambrosio’s soul, reveals Matildais a male demon sent to corrupt him. This is from Spenser: a male spirit masquesas the False Florimell. Matilda’s postcoital “manliness” is therefore theflaunting sashaying of a triumphant drag-queen demon. Our first andpsychologically primary reading of the novel has been in complete error. Themeltingly delicious sex between Ambrosio and Matilda—all pantings, twinings, andobscure refinements—has been homosexual and daemonic, not heterosexual. Our ownsexual perceptions have been seduced. Sensuality aglow in Gothic gloom: surelyKeats has normalized Lewis’ carnal scene for The Eve of Saint Agnes, with itsbedchamber show of lush sweetmeats.Matilda’s male identity is not the only surprise at the end of The Monk. Luciferreveals that Ambrosio has unwittingly committed incest and matricide: “Antoniaand Elvira perished by your hand. That Antonia whom you violated, was yoursister! that Elvira whom you murdered, gave you birth!”27[ch25_notes.html#ch09note27a] Here again is the riddling sound of impactedsexual psychodrama, which I found in Shakespeare’s As You Like It and Sade’s 120Days of Sodom. The Monk turns out to be a festering family romance. Lucifer’sincantation, unlike Rosalind’s, looks toward the past. It is like a curtaindrawn back from a Mannerist panorama, where we see the sweeping diagonal ofAmbrosio’s spiritual history in a glare of lurid light. Ambrosio is the firsthaunted hero of Romantic sex-crime. As You Like It ends with the reknitting ofRenaissance community, but The Monk ends in terrible primeval isolation. Luciferdrops Ambrosio onto a rocky nightmare landscape, like Mona Lisa’s lunar lawn. Heis “bruised and mangled,” his limbs “broken and dislocated.” The sun scorcheshim, insects devour him, eagles tear his flesh and dig out his eyeballs: Lewis,like Sade, has a Darwinian vision of amoral apocalyptic nature. The Gothic novelrebuts Rousseau: The Monk redaemonizes sex, linking it to sin, suffering, andnatural brutality. Ambrosio’s incest demonstrates the occult compulsiveness ofsex. He is magnetically drawn to his unknown mother and sister by unconsciousfatality. I suspect Balzac borrowed this detail for The Girl with the GoldenEyes. The Romantic prestige of incest springs from its reversal of history andits collapsing of psychic energies into the overenlarged self. Incest is part ofthe sexually archaic material released into society whenever hierarchies weaken.Satan is the severe pagan god of The Monk. At the end, Lucifer shows his truechthonian form: “blasted limbs,” taloned hands and feet, snaky Medusan hair. Buthis first appearance is as an Apollonian angel, meant to dupe thehomosexual-tending Ambrosio. Lucifer is a dazzling naked ephebe with fiery longhair and crimson wings. He wears a star on his forehead and diamond bracelets onhis arms and ankles. He carries a silver myrtle branch. Romanticism returns tothe Renaissance style of epiphanic sexual personae. In art, self-display ismeaning, more than criticism has understood. I have shown this iconicism goingback to Egypt and Greece. Lewis’ Lucifer aestheticizes and sexualizes a Biblicalseraph, a Babylonian not a Hebraic style. He may be influenced by Spenser’sByzantine Belphoebe, who also halts narrative action. Lewis’ Lucifer is againthe “light-bearer,” but he is hard and crystalline. His silver branch is agolden bough, the wand with which art freezes and transcends vegetative nature.Appearing in a rose-colored cloud, Lucifer fills the monk’s “cavern” with airand light. Nietzsche sees the German mind in “clouds and everything that isunclear.” Spengler identifies occult Magian experience with the“world-cavern.”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note28a] The Apollonianism of Lewis’androgyne propels sunlit Mediterranean formalism into the daemonic murk of theGothic novel. His seraph may be in Faust’s Euphorion, in Balzac’s Seraphita, andin the ghost of Bloom’s son in Joyce’s Ulysses, a “fairy boy” whose diamond andruby buttons and violet colors recall the seraph’s diamonds and rose light.There is latent eroticism in the entire tradition of the “novel of terror,”which began in late eighteenth-century Gothicism and became the modern horrorfilm. Freud says “the sexually exciting influence of some painful affects, suchas fear, shuddering, and horror, … explains why so many seek opportunities toexperience such sensations” in books or the theater.29[ch25_notes.html#ch09note29a] The thrill of terror is passive, masochistic, andimplicitly feminine. It is imaginative submission to overwhelming superiorforce. The vast audience of the Gothic novel was and is female. Men whocultivate the novel or film of terror seek sex-crossing sensations. Horror filmsare most popular among adolescents, whose screams are Dionysian signals ofsexual awakening. Reviewers often wonder why the packed audiences of bloodyslasher films are sedate couples on weekend dates. Shared fear is a physicallystimulating sexual transaction. Freud’s use of the word “shuddering” shows thecommon area between fear and orgasmic pleasure. In Yeats’s “Leda and the Swan,”the “shudder in the loins” is both the rapist’s climax and the victim’s fright.Violent horror films, of the splattering kind now so common, seem to me a mostpedestrian taste. A classy genre of vampire film follows a style I callpsychological high Gothic. It begins in Coleridge’s medieval Christabel and itsdescendants, Poe’s Ligeia and James’s The Turn of the Screw. A good example isDaughters of Darkness (1971), starring Delphine Seyrig as an elegant lesbianvampire. High Gothic is abstract and ceremonious. Evil has become world-weary,hierarchical glamour. There is no bestiality. The theme is eroticized westernpower, the burden of history. The Hunger (1983) comes close to being amasterpiece of this genre but is ruined by horrendous errors, as when the regalCatherine Deneuve is made to crawl around on all fours, slavering over cutthroats. Please. Butchery is not the point of vampirism. Sex—domination andsubmission—is. Gothic horror must be moderated by Apollonian discipline, or itturns into gross buffoonery. The run-of-the-mill horror film is anti-aestheticand anti-idealizing. Its theme is sparagmos, the form-pulverizing energies ofDionysus. Horror films unleash the forces repressed by Christianity—evil and thebarbarism of nature. Horror films are rituals of pagan worship. There westernman obsessively confronts what Christianity has never been able to bury orexplain away. Horror stories ending in the victory of good are no more numerousthan those ending in the threat of evil’s return. Nature, like the vampire, willnot stay in its grave.Vulgar horror films awash in red slop or grungy decay reflect a NorthernEuropean sensibility, the self-soiling of too-clean Protestantism. Undignifiedabuse of the body is analogous to medieval gargoyles or fairy tales’ dwarves andtrolls, whom I find impossible to take seriously, even in Wagner. TheMediterranean rightly identifies chthonian deformations with impressive femalemonsters, like Scylla. Northern European male trolls are an evasion of the harshreality of female nature. Horror films dwell on Dionysian mutilations of orencrustations upon the human figure—scabs, scars, swellings. Movie monsters seemcovered with moss or fungus. They are as gnarled and lumpish as tree stumps. G.Wilson Knight says, “Much of our horror at death is, at bottom, a physicalrepulsion.”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note30a] The horror film uses rot as aprimary material, part of the Christian west’s secret craving for Dionysiantruths. The horror film blunders about, seeking, without realizing it, thechthonian swamp of generation, the female matrix. There is dissolution innature, but there is also fecundity and cosmic grandeur. The horror film isphilosophically incomplete, because Christianity is incomplete. Classicalpaganism had a far more comprehensive view of sex and nature. Like Fiftiesscience-fiction films, Seventies disaster films, such as The Towering Inferno,have been blamed on international political tensions and anxieties. I disagree.Dreams of disaster will always appear when benevolent Rousseauism is in the air.The liberal Sixties, identifying sex and nature with love and peace, producedthe Sadean counterreaction of Seventies catastrophism. The present preoccupationwith nuclear apocalypse is also crypto-religious. Fear of world holocaust isanother self-haunting, a way to subordinate the self to the cosmos in an era ofeasy, all-forgiving therapies and faiths.The eighteenth-century novel of terror inherited the emotional complex ofsublimity. The idea of the sublime came to the Augustans from Roman Longinus andculminated in Edmund Burke’s Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideasof the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). Burke sees “a mode of terror, or of pain”as the cause of the sublime. Burke anticipates Freud’s idea of the sexualexcitation in fear: “Terror is a passion which always produces delight when itdoes not press too close.”31 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note31a] Lionel Trillingwrongly connects Burke’s sublime with masculinity: “The experience of terrorstimulates an energy of aggression and dominance.”32[ch25_notes.html#ch09note32a] But Burke’s locutions clearly demonstrate thepassive self-subordination of male devotees of the sublime. In Shelley’s “MontBlanc,” nature overwhelms male imagination with chilling fascistic force. Thesexual element is already apparent in early theories of the sublime. JohnDennis’ essay on Longinus (1704) says the sublime “ravishes and transports us.”It is “an invincible Force, which commits a pleasing Rape upon the very Soul ofthe Reader.” Schiller too, following Burke, sees a “paroxysm” or “shudder” inthe sublime, a joy turning to “rapture.”33 [ch25_notes.html#ch09note33a] Thesublime, a mode of pagan vision, is one of the first historical signs of theRomantic withdrawal from masculine action. In sublimity and Gothic terror,western emotion opens itself directly to nature, with its ghostly flood ofarchaic night."},{"pageContent":"10SEX BOUND AND UNBOUNDBlakeWilliam Blake is the British Sade, as Emily Dickinson is the American Sade.Directly inspired by The Faerie Queene and its incomplete response in ParadiseLost, Blake makes sex war the first theatrical conflict of English Romanticism.The daemonic wombs of the Gothic novel are too confined for Blake’s cosmicdrama. In the same decade as Sade, Blake turns sex and psyche into a Darwiniancycle of turbulent natural energies, fleeing, chasing, devouring. The postwarcritics who rescued Romantic poetry from low esteem tended to ignore or downplaytroublesome sexual and moral ambiguities. For example, Northrop Frye’spioneering study of Blake, Fearful Symmetry (1947), optimistically promotessexual liberation in a way that seems, a weary generation later, simplistic andnaive. How much was hoped from sex. How little sex can deliver. Blake’s writingis split by a terrible contradiction: Blake wants to free sex from its socialand religious constraints, but he also wants to escape the domination of theGreat Mother of chthonian nature. Alas, with every turn toward sex, we run rightback into mother nature’s dark embrace. Blake’s tireless productivity as poetand draughtsman came from the intolerable entrapments male imagination findsitself in when reflecting on nature. Blake’s poetry is sexual grand opera ofinstability, anguish, and resentment.Prophet and radical, Blake denounces all social forms. He takes Rousseau’shostility to civilization farther than Rousseau himself. For Blake, sexualpersonae, which belong to the social realm of role-playing, are artificial andfalse. He differs from the other English Romantics on several points. Allbelieve love is primal energy. But Blake is the only one to oppose androgyny asa solution to rigid sex roles. Blake condemns androgyny as solipsism. Hishermaphrodites are monstrous. Romantic solipsism, a self-communing andself-fructification, becomes sterile in Blake. Why? Because Blake, though hefollows and extends Rousseau’s politics, sees nature with Sade’s eyes. In Blake,Rousseau’s tender nature mother makes a fin-de-siècle leap into daemonicmonumentality. Brother to Sade, whom he could not have known or read, Blakerevives the bloodthirsty goddess of ancient mystery religion, sensational withAsiatic barbarism. He longs to defeat her. But by attacking her, he creates herand confirms her power. Ironically, he becomes her slave and emissary, a voicecrying in the wilderness. Nowhere else in literature is the Great Mother asmassively, violently eloquent as she is in Blake.Blake, following Spenser, constructs a complex symbolic psychology not yet fullyunderstood. One of Blake’s basic patterns is that of warring contraries throughwhich spiritual progress is pursued, as in The Faerie Queene. As his poetrydevelops, Blake’s principal combat is between male and female, metaphors for thetension between humanity and nature. In the early Songs of Innocence (1789), sexwar is not yet an issue, but it is prefigured in the theme of tyrannical powerrelations, toward which Blake takes Rousseau’s view but Sade’s tone. Blake isinterested in coercion, repetition-compulsion, spiritual rape. He sees sadismand vampirism in male authority figures. The child speakers of “The ChimneySweeper” and “The Little Black Boy” are physically exploited and psychologicallymanipulated. They are the invisible slaves or houris of a corrupt new industrialsociety. Their minds have been invaded by a daemonic compact of church andstate. “So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm”: adult voices comefrom their mouths in evil ventriloquism. The sexual element in this brainwashingis evident in “Holy Thursday,” where grey-haired beadles with “wands as white assnow” herd a stream of children into St. Paul’s Cathedral. The wands areSpenser’s phallic white rods, here symbolizing wintry devitalization. Thebeadles are perverts, voyeurs, decadents. They freeze the children’s river oflife.In Songs of Innocence white is the color of desexing. The white hair of thelamblike chimney sweep, little Tom Dacre, expresses his premature adultexperience. The child-slaves advance from childhood to old age without passingthrough adult virility. As in the penalty card of capitalist Monopoly: “Godirectly to Jail. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.” Elsewhere in Blake,sexual jealousy cripples human energy. In Songs of Innocence, male authority isan impotent Herod, massacring the innocents while ravishing them with eye andmind. Society operates by vicious pederasty. In 1789, both sexes still powderedtheir hair or wore wigs. The eigthteenth century honored age and tradition,overthrown by Romanticism in its youth-cult. Blake’s white-haired chimney sweepis ritual victim of an unnatural regime. The high stylization ofeighteenth-century wigs—we hear of women unable to pass through doorways, oftowering arrangements of fruit, foliage, and birds’ nests—was a symptom ofdecadence. Powdered hair is a perverse fantasy of frost and angel dust,worldliness masquerading as innocence. Blake’s artificially whitened childrenare overexperienced and knowledgeable. An unsettling analogy can be found in aRoman imperial sarcophagus decorated with leering obese putti, fetid with adultsensuality. Blake’s cherubs are depraved by adult tyranny. Henry James takes upBlake’s theme in The Turn of the Screw, where an obsessed hierarch, thegoverness, projects sexual sophistication upon a boy who dies an exhaustedprisoner of her febrile imagination. Blake’s white-haired chimney sweeprepresents the class of all exploited persons. The white hair is sexuallyuniversalizing, because the exploited are humiliatingly feminized by amoralpolitical power. Erich Fromm says, “For the authoritarian character there exist,so to speak, two sexes: the powerful ones and the powerless ones.”1[ch25_notes.html#ch10note1a] Sexual personae in Songs of Innocence are imaginedas generations cannibalizing each other. Blake’s innocent children areprecursors of his male victims emasculated by cruel women.“Infant Joy” is Blake’s most neglected major poem. Harold Bloom devotes onesentence to it in his book on Blake, and he and Lionel Trilling omit it from theOxford Anthology of Romantic literature. “Infant Joy” has a deceptivesimplicity:I have no nameI am but two days old.—What shall I call thee?I happy amJoy is my name,—Sweet joy befall thee!Pretty joy!Sweet joy but two days old.Sweet joy I call thee:Thou dost smile.I sing the whileSweet joy befall thee.We have regressed to the infancy of consciousness. We see Rousseau’s saintlychild as it crosses the border into being. What do we find there? Tenderness andinnocence threatened on all sides. I learned to read poetry from Milton Kessler,whose brilliant remarks on “Infant Joy” I reconstruct from my college notes:“Infant Joy” is a flawless physical caress which induces weeping. The metaphorfor this poem is taking the child in one’s hands. But an adult taking up anewborn is suddenly, involuntarily conscious of the ease with which he couldcrush it to pieces. In “Infant Joy” there is a sense of the enormous proximity,the closeness and intimacy of the speaker. The child has no voice of its ownyet. It is given an identity by some great coercive power. There are certainforms of sadistic tenderness more intimate than the psyche will allow. “InfantJoy” is like Theodore Roethke’s “Elegy for Jane,” where the bearlike poet, withhis terrifying and roaring energy, approaches a delicate being in dangerousnearness. The elegy begins: “I remember the neckcurls, limp and damp astendrils.”“Infant Joy” exposes the authoritarianism in Rousseauist “concern,” “caring,”and “understanding,” today’s self-righteous liberal values. In the poem’s eeriedialogue I hear George Herbert’s homoerotic intensities. In its blankencapsulization I feel claustrophobic Spenserian embowerment. “Infant Joy” comesfrom the rape cycle of The Faerie Queene. It is the provocative vulnerability ofthe fleeing Florimell, the purity that sucks filth into its wake. “Infant Joy”is a Rousseauist vacuum into which Sadean nature is about to rush.Blake’s infant has no name, no persona. It is barely individuated. Infant joy iswhat Blake later calls a “state,” a condition of being. We feel rawness,sensitivity, defenseless passivity. Rousseauist childhood is no blessing.Sensory experience is the avenue of sadomasochism. “Infant Joy” recreates thedumb muscle state of our physicality, the readiness which converts into sex, orrather the surging power that is sex. George Eliot says, “If we had a keenvision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing thegrass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar whichlies on the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about wellwadded with stupidity.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch10note2a] “Infant Joy” removes thebuffering between persons and beings. Eliot imagines a perfect perceptualopenness and a sensory flood into a receptacle too small to contain it. Theegoless softness of the poem awakes in us Kessler’s sensation of overwhelmingpower, which we unconsciously check. Sharpening the senses inflames them—andhere comes sadism. Rousseauist responsiveness and nurturance automatically flipover into their opposites.“Infant Joy” has the moral emptiness of Spenser’s femininity, a space cleared innature. It is like the still heart of a geode, rimmed with crystalline teeth. In“Infant Joy” a devouring presence waits, a Blakean tiger: the reader. This isone of the uncanniest poems in literature. Seemingly so slight and transparent,it harbors something sinister and maniacal. “Infant Joy” is stronglyritualistic. Kessler calls it a “caress.” The poem’s hypnotic repetitions are aseries of soothing gestures, like rubbing a lantern to make a genie appear. Thepoem is a spell materializing a dark power, latent in the reader. “Infant Joy”is a daemonizing poem: it daemonizes the reader, drawing him into the rapaciouscycle of natural process. By making the reader a sadist, it subverts hiscomplacent trust in his own morality and benevolence. Blake was contemptuous of“Mercy, Pity, Peace.” “Infant Joy” is a parodistic critique of Rousseauism. Asmuch as Blake’s chimney-sweep poems, it indicts the oppressive paternalism ofsociety’s self-appointed guardians. Every gesture of love is an assertion ofpower. There is no selflessness or self-sacrifice, only refinements ofdomination.The psychosexual design of “Infant Joy” is hovering. Hovering is the relation ofspeaker to infant, reader to poem. The evil droning menace in such proximity isshown in Blake’s watercolor, God Creating Adam (fig. 31 [ch10.html#ch10fig31]).Winged Urizen, Blake’s tyrant-Jehovah, hovers with a smothering weight abovecorpselike Adam, stretched flat as if crucified. God is a vampire snatching backman’s Promethean fire. The picture seems to show an unnatural sex act,homosexual and sadomasochistic. Criticism is squeamish about admitting theseperversities in Blake. Hovering is always emotionally and sexually problematic.It is everywhere in the Late Romantic voyeur, Walt Whitman, who imagines himselfwandering all night, “swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping.” He bends“with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers”; he listens to the quietbreathing of children; he passes his hands “soothingly to and fro” over thesuffering and restless. Elsewhere, lifting the gauze over a cradle, he stares “along time” at the infant and “silently” brushes away flies (The Sleepers; Songof Myself, 8). When Wordsworth looks out from Westminster Bridge, the city’ssleepers are only inferred. Whitman’s sleepers are warm, sensuous bodies.Whitman’s all-embracing Rousseauist love is Romantic vampirism, scopophiliactyranny. The poet’s eye is omnipotent, while its objects are passive anddefenseless, without thought or identity. The nearness with which Whitmanapproaches the sleepers is predicated on their unconsciousness. He makes themfeminine objects of his godlike delectation. Romantic love—all love—is sex andpower. In nearness we enter each other’s animal aura. There is magic there, bothblack and white.Image [../images/f0275-01.jpg]31. William Blake, God Creating Adam, 1795.Violating the psychic space of his sleepers, Whitman rapes them. Wordsworth tooremembers his boyhood “merciless ravage” of a nut grove, a “virgin scene” thathe left a Spenserian “mutilated bower” (“Nutting”). Trespass is alwayssubliminally erotic. Piercing a temenos—a sacred space of mind, body,bedchamber, or nature—is always a domination and defilement. Blake’s “InfantJoy” evokes an impulse toward criminal trespass. Reading it, we hover at theedge of a forbidden locus of experience. We hold our breath. We uneasily sensethe aesthetic contrast between our adult grossness and the infant’s delicacy,eroticized by the poem’s implied touching. The infant exists in Blake’s Beulahstate of blissful passivity, the numb groping of polymorphous perversity. Theinfant is blind. But we aggressively see. Along the track of our seeing skidsour unbrakeable will.The same dialectic of blind whiteness and aggressive eye occurs in The FaerieQueene, where the boisterous cannibals hang over sleeping Serena to study her“dainty flesh,” which the poet gives a silky sheen (VI. viii. 36–43). Is thisthe source of Blake’s poem? The violation in “Infant Joy” is the exposure ofsomething private, unprotected, quivering, and moist. An infant two days old isbarely sexually differentiated. It is still muzzy from the womb. “Infant Joy”brings us face to face with the biologically fundamental. The preconscioussimplicity of Blake’s infant is almost cellular. In fact, the poem is a cell,one simple cell of protoplasmic life. “Infant Joy” unveils a physiologicalmystery. We have penetrated into a female-realm, as Melville does in Tartarus ofMaids or Leonardo in his drawing of a fetus. This is proved by Blake’s drawingof the poem, where an infant lies in the lap of a hovering mother and both areswallowed up in the flamelike maw of a giant flower, Blake’s rapacious nature(fig. 32 [ch10.html#ch10fig32]). Thus the infant’s powerlessness is a version ofthe chimney sweeps’ enslavement. The womblike “Infant Joy” is a surgical openingup of a female body, nature’s organic machine. “Infant Joy” is the secretsex-crime of a ravisher-poet. It looks forward to Blake’s overtly sadisticMental Traveller, where the “Babe” of humanity is handed over to old mothernature, surgeon and torturer. The Mental Traveller literalizes the authoritarianmanipulations of “Infant Joy.” Blake corrects Rousseau: man is born into hischains, the mother-born body binding us to creature comfort, sex, and pain.In Songs of Experience (1794), “Infant Joy” advances to sexual maturity. Blake’sresponse to “Infant Joy” is not “Infant Sorrow” but “The Sick Rose.” Here theSpenserian embowerment of Blake’s newborn shifts from Rousseau to Sade:O Rose thou art sick.The invisible worm,That flies in the nightIn the howling storm:Has found out thy bedOf crimson joy:And his dark secret loveDoes thy life destroy.“The Sick Rose” is Spenser’s Bower of Bliss destroyed by sex war. The literaryconvention of female flight and male pursuit, satirized by Spenser in theever-fleeing Florimell, reveals its innate hostility. Woman’s flirtatious artsof self-concealment mean man’s approach must take the form of rape. The phallusbecomes the conquerer worm, death’s agent. Withdrawal and concealment are alwaysnegative in Blake. Here they provoke sadistic attack, partly a hallucination bythe reclusive rose. The rose is a narcissistically convoluted psyche. Femalegenitals are traditionally symbolized by the queen of flowers, from the medievalMystic Rose of Mary to the rock classic, “Sally, Go Round the Roses.” Blake seessolipsism as the danger in female sexuality. The rose’s exclusiveness blendsfear, shame, and pride. Its layered petals are a form of self-population. Thatthe rose’s “bed of crimson joy” suggests masturbatory pleasure is well acceptedby critics. For Blake the rose’s self-completion is perverse and sterile. Therose is a sexual schismatic, making division where there should be wholeness andunity in nature. It is thus an early version of the solipsistic hermaphroditesof Blake’s prophetic books.Image [../images/f0277-01.jpg]32. William Blake, Infant Joy, from Songs of Innocence and of Experience, 1794.Blake’s masturbatory rose belongs to the tradition begun in Egypt whereautoeroticism is a method of cosmogony. Blake sees a sexually private world as aprison cell. The rose is sick because, she thinks, the communion of sex drainsand obliterates her identity. Blake’s own ambivalence toward sex produces thecryptic duality of the poem. Male fear of woman’s self-containment is writtenall over mythology and culture. It is male, not female identity that isannihilated in the nightstorm of nature. The fascination of woman’s autonomy isplain in Ingres’ The Turkish Bath, a witty parallel to Blake’s rose poem (fig.33 [ch10.html#ch10fig33]). Ingres’ painting is oddly round, a rose window orMadonna tondo turned pagan peephole, through which we spy the plump nude bodiesof a dozen women amorously entwined, like lesbian flower petals. It is a snakyMedusa head, steamy with Asiatic lewdness. Trying to liberate sex from society,Blake keeps running back into the cul-de-sac of female sexuality. Courtlyconvention alone did not make woman “the hidden.” Nature makes woman’s body acavern of the unseen, divined by sadomasochistic mystery religion.Image [../images/f0278-01.jpg]33. Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, The Turkish Bath, 1862.The ambiguous “Sick Rose” qualifies the sexual assertions of Blake’s earlier TheBook of Thel (1789). A cloud tells the virgin Thel she is “the food of worms”:“Every thing that lives, / Lives not alone, nor for itself.” Nature asharmonious interrelationship: this Buddhist perception is not sustained inBlake, who is too conflicted about the dominance of female nature. In “The SickRose,” Thel’s worms are phallic heavenly messengers, miming the growth cycle.Blake thinks the being living alone and for itself is sick because it rejectsthe strife of contraries by which energy evolves. Thel’s book ends in hystericalretreat, as she jumps from her seat and dashes shrieking back to her nativevalleys. Blake combines the seat-stuck virgin of Milton’s Comus with Spenser’sfleeing Florimell and Belphoebe, who disappears mid-sentence. Blake regardsvirginity as a perverse fetish. He wants to believe Thel’s rejection ofsexuality is childish, a swerve from menarche and fruitfulness. Thus Blake’schastity is diametrically opposite to that of Spenser and Shakespeare, for whomit signifies spiritual integrity and force. Like Sade, Blake sees chastity asunnatural, energy-killing. But in urging Thel, a sick rose, to cure herself bysurrendering to communion, Blake is closer to Shakespeare of the comedies, whereall are given in marriage, than he is to his fellow Romantic poets, for whomsolitude is imaginative perfection. Shakespeare, subordinating sex to society,makes a Renaissance escape from the problem confronting Blake. Trying toeliminate society but redeem sex, Blake keeps finding himself in Leonardo’srockscape. Every inch he saves for sex is lost in the desolate mile of mothernature.Blake’s “London,” like Emily Dickinson’s “Our journey had advanced,” is one ofthose rare lyric poems that achieve epic sweep. The Hebrew prophet wandersthrough modern Babylon, which he denounces with the voice of Rousseau. In“London,” institutions, symbolized by. church and palace, oppress individuals.Their impersonal walls are deaf to the chimney sweep’s cry and soldier’s sigh.For Blake, buildings are society’s face, abstract, mechanical, lifeless.“London” has a radical new way of seeing grand works of urban architecture asblank, sinister monoliths. Blake prefigures Baudelaire and Kafka in his visionof the dead night-world of the modern city, today an arid grid of glass andconcrete. Society’s indifference to the suffering poor paints it black. Blake’schurch is a whited sepulchre stained with vice, the soot that will not out. Fromthe sky falls a plague of red rain, the dying soldier’s last breath wafted froma foreign battlefield and turning from breeze to drizzle over foggy London. Thenameless massacred innocents leave their mark in red writing on the royal wall,their blood but also Pharaoh’s, French terror leaping to England. The city weepsbut does not recognize its own tears. Church and palace are a frozen orpetrified face. Emotionless stone walls are what Blake’s prophetic books call“the limit of contraction.” If the palace face or facade runs with the blood ofsacrificial lambs, then the poem is a Veronica’s veil, imprinted with the faceof suffering. The trickling blood is Christ’s, for industrial society isun-Christian. George Herbert tells death, “Our Saviour’s death did put someblood / Into thy face.” Modern London, drained of Christian compassion, isspiritually dead.Blake’s cold-walled city-faces are obviously sexless. They are sexless personae,looking forward to Emily Dickinson’s pitiless clock faces, whose rule of time isenforced by church, state, father, and death. Blake’s church and palace wallsare self-armouring calcifications. His “Human Form Divine” is obliterated in themagnification of persons into institutions, coarse insensate colossi. Citybuildings are manufactured objects, a Romantic mode of androgyne. “London”logically ends in the syphilitic streetwalker, since she bears the displacedsexuality of respectable society. She is diseased because her sex is both secretand commercial. Blake’s harlot is nature, exiled from the city and thereforereturning under cover of night to stalk and prey.One of Blake’s remarks about whores: “In a wife I would desire / What in whoresis always found / The lineaments of Gratified desire.” Stone tablets, stonyface. Blake thinks religious repression of sex makes misery and hypocrisy.Lower-class whores, then and now, sop up the male run-off from “decent”middle-class marriage. Men chase by night those they will not greet by day. ForBlake, the whore is another victim or scapegoat, like exploited children andsoldiers. She is the third emblematic oppressed individual of “London.” But inanother way, she is the poem’s third institution. Outcast and vagrant, she willextrude her own housey shell in the nineteenth century, era of the courtesan.Blake is the first artist to recognize the whore as a kindred spirit. In Paris,artists and whores will dwell together in creative mass marriage for over acentury. In Zola’s Nana (1880), the courtesan presides from the apex of publichierarchy. Church, palace, harlot: Blake’s sequence recalls the ritual templeprostitution of the Asiatic Great Mother, whom he normally despises. Is hisharlot “youthful” because she is a vampire drunk with the male blood of theprior stanza? The “midnight streets” of “London” are the labyrinthine bowels ofthe earth mother, from which Icaran imagination tries to escape. The poem joinsancient archetype to a modernist panorama of hostile architecture. Thecombination recurs in Kafka, where the bureaucratic labyrinth of the tyrantfather is dreamily one with the womblike rooms of the abandoning mother. Blake’s“Marriage hearse,” from which Emily Dickinson will write one of her greatestpoems, is the mobile carriage of our own death-tending bodies. The earth mother,both womb and tomb, has the last word in Blake’s poem, as she does everywhereand at all times.In The Mental Traveller, Blake moves the epic conflicts of “London” into theopen air of stormy nature. Institutions, once his Rousseauist concern, fade intoirrelevance. The Mental Traveller is Blake’s recognition of the insuperableproblem of nature, which he once tried to tame into a romance of mutuallyrewarding sex. I think the sadomasochism of this poem comes from Blake’s readingof The Faerie Queene, whose decadent brutalities he understood as no moderncritic has. The Mental Traveller is Sade made poetry. The acrid clarity oflanguage is sharply modern or Late Romantic. Blake is way beyond Rousseau. Heanswers himself, as Coleridge will answer and correct Wordsworth. Bloom says ofThe Mental Traveller: “All the males in the poem are one man, humanity, men andwomen together. All the females are nature, the confinements of the human.”3[ch25_notes.html#ch10note3a] The Mental Traveller is a Sadean critique of loveand sex. I insist that the genders of Blake’s sexual personae must be acceptedas dramatically authoritative in their own right.The Mental Traveller is a cycle of sexual cannibalism enacted by a male and afemale figure, who attack and retreat in obsessive rhythms of victory anddefeat. A boy babe is given to “a Woman Old,” who nails him down upon a rock,binds iron thorns around his head, pierces his hands and feet, and cuts hisheart out “to make it feel both cold & heat.” “Her fingers number every Nerve.”She lives on his “shrieks & cries” and “grows young as he grows old.” Now thecycle reverses: “he rends up his Manacles / And binds her down for his delight.”The poem moves by systaltic throbbing of the heart. Blake’s oscillations betweenpower and weakness are vortices moving in opposite directions—the source ofYeats’s theory of historical gyres. Each sadistic act by Blake’s female is aportent of her future torment and indeed the occult ritual which invokes it. Theentire poem is a ritual. Its systematic cataloguing of atrocities resembles theitemizations of Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom. Like Sade, Blake foreshadows Frazer’santhropological syncretism. The Mental Traveller recreates the bloody rites ofthe Great Mother. Nature, not society, is humanity’s ultimate arena. The MentalTraveller has renewed life in one of rock’s major lyrics, a song it surelyinfluenced, the Rolling Stones’ “Jumpin’ Jack Flash.”Blake’s newborn babe goes straight to his crucifixion. Innocence is ravaged byexperience, a Madonna turned hag. Rebel Orc always ages into tyrant Urizen.Blake has learned from the moral decay of the French Revolution, whose sadismbetrayed its patron, Rousseau. The babe’s tortures recall the legends ofPrometheus, Jesus, and Loki. Blake daringly superimposes classical, Christian,and Norse mythologies without giving Christianity its usual preeminence.Masochistic male sufferers, whom we saw in Rousseau, Goethe, and Kleist, areprofuse in Romanticism. Here the babe is handed over to a grim tutor for hiseducation, as Achilles is given to the centaur. The witch of The MentalTraveller is the first malign governess of nineteenth-century literature. Thebabe’s training or Bildung is harshly physical. Blake anticipates Freud ingrounding intellect in the body. In his earlier “To Tirzah,” witch and motherare one: “Thou Mother of my Mortal part / With cruelty didst mould my Heart, /And with false self-deceiving tears, / Didst bind my Nostrils Eyes & Ears.”Nature, weaving the tissues of the body, wraps us at birth in her shroud.Nailing the babe down by his five senses, the witch “catches his shrieks in cupsof gold.” A gold cup is chillingly archetypal. It is virginal, vaginal,eucharistic. Thel’s golden bowl is her selfish self-preservation. It is theorganic morally petrified, like “London”’s walls. The witch’s miserly gold cupsare her infatuated self-regard and self-divinization, the sexual solipsism ofthe sick rose. A poisoned cup: the Whore of Babylon holds a gold cup scummy withfornications; Loki’s wife cups up the venom of a serpent hung above his boundbody. Blake’s witch is a vampire catching spurts of infant blood in order todrink them. We saw in “London” how Blake magically turns sound to sight, sighsand cries into running blood. The gold cups of The Mental Traveller are its ownstanzas brimming with the agonies of humanity.At the start of The Mental Traveller, the dominance of female over male seems socomplete as to be insuperable. The babe is inert matter manipulated by a femaleFirst Mover. She knows him through sadistic touching. Normally, female bodiesare the stringed instrument plucked by males. Here mother nature is a masterharpist making dark music to herself. By his torments, the male gains hisidentity, still missing in the newborn of “Infant Joy.” His gender is reinforcedby nature’s biological authoritarianism. The Mental Traveller proceeds by sexualperipeties. The first is a pietà, where the old witch becomes a virgin with her“bleeding youth.” The Great Mother, mourning her son-lover, is wrestled down andbound in turn. Now male exults in woman’s masochistic vulnerability. Service hasswitched on the Sadean tennis court. Gender flames and fades in The MentalTraveller. Dominance and submission, nature’s law, compulsively structures thepoem. We saw a similar pattern in Kleist’s Penthesilea. The Mental Traveller hasa choreographic ritualism. It’s like a parody of ballroom dancing where the ladykeeps trying to lead. At the end, we are sent back to the start of the poem toread it again—a trope Joyce adopts for Finnegans Wake. The Mental Traveller is auroboros mimicking the circularity of natural process. Each sex devours theother.Blake’s Mental Traveller shows sex as a barbaric ritual drama where theperformers periodically exchange masks. The poem is energized by explosivereturns of the repressed. Woman’s provocative flight recurs late in the poem.She is a stag fleeing through her own self-planted thicket of fear, imagesstraight from The Faerie Queene. She is the sick rose wrapped in menacing pubicthorns. Her coquettish “arts of Love & Hate” come from the poetry of courtlylove. We are born into sex war but learn to prolong it. The thicket is thetheatrical personae of Petrarchan love, intellectualizing desire. For Blake,multiple personae are sterile rusing deceptions.The first scene of The Mental Traveller, with its sadomasochistic bondage, has aclashing industrial character. The hag performs her ghastly tasks withbusinesslike efficiency and managerial zeal. The rock is a torture rack oranvil, an image in other Blake poems. We are all on the anvil, hammered bymother nature. Nature is a factory, a satanic mill which turns men into robots.The infant, his heart cut out, is crowned with iron thorns, reminiscent not onlyof Christ but of Spenser’s robot Talus, “the iron man.” In his painting of TheFaerie Queene, Blake shows Talus with a burr of metal spikes about his head.Heart and brain aborted, his maleness crushed by enforced passivity, the babe isan unsexed manufactured object.The frightful opening of The Mental Traveller is a brazen incantation of femaletriumph of the will. I find nothing in the poem suggesting that the sexual cyclecan be ended or transcended. Criticism has over-philosophized The MentalTraveller and made it moralistic and didactic, rarely Romantic aims. The poemhas overwhelming power as ferocious psychodrama. Its technique is surreal sexualcinema. The Mental Traveller is a ritual of riddance, an externalization ofconflict. Blake sets the brute sex cycle going, like a perpetual motion machine,then lets it spin off into space to devour itself. The poem is circle magic. Butthe externalization did not work, for Blake had to return to the same themeagain and again. His poems got longer and longer, as if epic scale could finallyfix the matter. The unfixable theme is universal female power. Sade and Blake’ssadomasochistic systems are rebuttals of Rousseau’s maternal naturism. The awfulenergy of Blake’s sinister females is equivalent to the eerie stillness ofGoethe’s brooding Mothers. Nineteenth-century Romantic literature and art aredominated by the femme fatale. Blake feels this coming and tries to stop it.Ironically, in grappling with mother nature, Blake has not so much laid herghost as raised and immortalized it. Our movements against nature lock us toher. Blake’s daemonized poetry gathers a storm cloud over sex that will neverclear.Like The Mental Traveller, “The Crystal Cabinet” was not published until 1863.Thus it could not have influenced Keats’s “La Belle Dame Sans Merci,” which itso resembles in dramatic form that the two poems must reveal a deep structure ofRomantic sexual imagination. “The Crystal Cabinet” is narrated by a male victimof female entrapment. A maiden catches him dancing in the wild. She puts himinto her “Cabinet” and locks him up with “a golden Key.” The cabinet, made ofgold, pearl, and crystal, contains “a World” under “a little lovely MoonyNight.” Gold cup, gold bowl, gold cabinet. The prison is the vagina. The key isthe male’s own penis, which woman steals to make herself hermaphroditicallycomplete. Sexual keys appear in Milton’s Comus, as well as Goethe’s Faust.Blake’s golden key is a golden bough, Vergil’s passport to a chthonianunderworld. Gold is also the male’s own narcissism. Blake elsewhere compares thephallus to “a pompous High Priest” entering the Holy of Holies or secret shrineof the vagina (Jerusalem 69:44).“The Crystal Cabinet” opens on the male’s carefree childhood, when he lives inthe body without ambivalence or fear. But sexual initiation ends his trustingview of nature. His rite de passage is into containment, luxurious buthumiliating. The maiden trapping him like bird or butterfly is a collector, aconnoisseur with a museum of sexual specimens. She is like Circe with her stableof swine or Omphale with her male domestics. The maiden’s calculation isdecadent. She is like the lordly Late Romantic collectors of Sade, Poe, andHuysmans. The crystal cabinet is a reliquary storing hosts or saints’ bones. Itis like Donne’s “well wrought urne,” both poem and funeral vase mingling theashes of canonized lovers. But Blake’s ashes are far more bitter. The male ismartyred, a lamb led to slaughter. The vagina is a sexual crematorium. Thecrystal cabinet destroys by miniaturizing (cutting an erection down to size). Itcontains another world and another maiden: “Translucent lovely shining clear /Threefold each in the other closd / O what a pleasant trembling fear.”Microcosms are dangerous in Blake because they are separatist and solipsistic.The crystal cabinet is like Spenser’s “world of glass,” both mirror and crystalball. The pregnant tear of Donne’s “Valediction: of weeping” contains thebeloved’s reflection and also “a globe” of the world. In Blake, the male entersa looking-glass world of sexual anti-matter. His pleasant fear is hismasochistic delectation at female dominance. The male willfully prolonging hissexual subordination makes his own hell.The crystal cabinet requires man’s voluptuous self-surrender. When he assertshimself, the illusion falls to pieces. The cabinet bursts, and he is “a weepingBabe upon the wild.” Near him reclines a “Weeping Woman pale.” The cabinet isSpenser’s torpid Bower of Bliss, here accidentally destroyed by a devotee. Likethe erotic idylls of Keats’s “Lamia” and “La Belle Dame Sans Merci,” Blake’spoem ends in cold, shame-filled awakening. A movement toward the illicitproduces a violent movement outward into desolation. The primary model is Adamand Eve’s expulsion from the garden. We see the same pattern in the finale ofMoby-Dick, where Ahab’s attempt to pierce the heart of nature by harpooning thewhite whale ends in catastrophe and vast, empty silence. “The Crystal Cabinet”says there is no way to understand nature. Every son is expelled from everymother. The more he searches for her through sex, the more she recedes from him.Bloom places the cabinet’s daemonically threefold hostess in “a carnival ofmirrors.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch10note4a] I think of the climax of Orson Welles’sThe Lady from Shanghai (1948), where Rita Hayworth as the siren of the labyrinthappears in dizzying profusion, until the hall of mirrors, like the crystalcabinet, is shattered by her angry male pursuer. Blake’s threefold maiden istriple Hecate, ominous and nocturnal. In Blake, any numerical multiple isdiseased. Unity is paradigmatic. The maiden’s “threefold Smile,” like Kali’smany arms, represents nature’s metamorphoses. But it is also multiple sexualpersonae, for Blake always artificial and mendacious. Hybrid forms in Blake arewanton trick lenses, suggesting vain self-contemplation. The maiden of “TheCrystal Cabinet” overpopulates herself, like the sick rose. Unlike Shakespeareof the transvestite comedies, Blake opposes psychic diversification as decadent.God may say, “Be fruitful, and multiply,” but Blake says, “Multiply, and befruitless.”The male narrator of “The Crystal Cabinet” believes he has entered sexualmaturity. But as he tries to claim adult authority, he is propelled back toinfancy. He is the helpless babe starting The Mental Traveller. The weepingwoman is the mother of his Nativity and Lamentation. “The Crystal Cabinet” endslike Giorgione’s The Tempest (1505), where a nude woman nurses a child under athundery sky. Blake’s cycle is replayed by D. H. Lawrence in Women in Love,where Gerald’s violent intercourse with Gudrun strangely transforms him into “aninfant… at its mother’s breast.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch10note5a] Restored to thelandscape where he was found, the male of “The Crystal Cabinet” undergoes amelancholy reabsorption into biology, symbolized by a pale woman half-dead fromlabor pains. Sex pleasure, sex torture: it’s all the same to mother nature.The crystal cabinet is a razed Temple of sex, from which the faithful aredispersed into the wilderness. Architecturally, Blake’s cabinet is unique.Primitive depiction of female genitals is stark and unadorned. Fertilityreligion makes pubic deltas or ridged ovoids. Literature and art follow themedieval Venusberg tradition of the Tannhäuser saga, where the mons venerisechoes earth’s rounded hills. Western depiction of male genitals tends to usefabricated rather than natural shapes—swords, spears, guns, herms, even (inMelville) a chimney. Whether Amazon or Hedda Gabler, the woman taking up a man’sweapon hermaphroditizes herself. Western masculinity defies female nature.A phallic totem is easily made and rather impressive. But how to achieve afemale sex symbolism of equal dignity? Melville’s Tartarus of Maids, forexample, though sympathetic to women’s plight, is a somewhat nauseating tour ofthe physiological waterworks. Woman as civilization rather than nature must berepresented by her secondary rather than primary sex organs. As I noted ofEgyptian art, the female breast as shapely adornment rather than saggy bladderaccompanies the invention of femininity, sign of advancing culture. Afterprehistory, the breast takes over western female symbolism. Remarkably, Blake’scrystal cabinet imagines female genitals at a high degree of artifice. There arefew parallels. Female genitalia are not beautiful by any aesthetic standard. Infact, as I argued earlier, the idea of beauty is a defensive swerve from theugliness of sex and nature. Female genitals are literally grotesque. That is,they are of the grotto, earth fissures leading to the chthonian cavern of thewomb. Italians have a special feeling for grottos and are constantly buildingthem behind homes or churches. It is part of our pagan heritage, our ancestralmemory of earth-cult. Female genitals inspire in the observer, depending uponsexual orientation, that stirring in the bowels which is either disgust or lust.“The Crystal Cabinet” shows lust flipping over to disgust. Blake’s golden femalegenitals are a work of art—but here that is evil. His radical revision oftraditional iconography is produced by his distrust of society. For him,literature and art reinforce the hostile game-playing of love; courtlyconvention traps the free energy of sex. But archetype thwarts Blake’sintention. The male, thrusting into the cabinet’s sexual center, sees where hecame from and is horrified. I reject criticism’s tidy assessment of Blake’s sextheory, where redeemed imagination opposes and reconciles civilization andnature. Poetry is written and read with emotion, not mind. Emotionally, Blake’sworld is out of control.Blake and Lawrence have reputations as sexual revolutionaries. But both wereagitated by the threat of female dominance, which their works prove rather thandisprove. Blake is our greatest poet of sexual anxiety. Bloom rightly says of“The Crystal Cabinet,” “The speaker has suffered only loss, through seeking insexual experience a finality it cannot afford anyone.”6[ch25_notes.html#ch10note6a] Bloom’s pessimistic realism is truer to Blake thanNorthrop Frye’s dreams of sexual harmony. My generation has seen the workings ofsexual freedom not in an imagined future but a chaotic present. Hence I valueBlake not as a prophet of sexual liberation but as a magus who has studied thesecrets of nature and seen the outrageous enslavements of our life in the body.The Mental Traveller and “The Crystal Cabinet” dramatize the limitations of sex.There is no sex without yielding to nature. And nature is a female domain.Blake’s dreadful fate was to see the abyss from which most men shrink: theinfantilism in all male heterosexuality. Criticism’s disregard of Blake’sblatant sadomasochism has censored him. Like Spenser, he left a message thatremains unread.Blake’s long prophetic poems have a curious psychological system. Bear with mefor a synopsis hacked out of the jungle of Blake scholarship, much of itfrustratingly contradictory.Human beings suffer division in the fallen realm of Experience, which is markedby the dramatic interaction of entities called Emanation and Spectre. TheEmanation is projected cathexis, a cinema of the unquiet mind. It is desirelonging for realization. Emanations can be of either sex, but the most importantones are female. In Innocence, the female Emanation is integrated within theself. In Experience, the Emanation must migrate outward (i.e., emanate). A selfwhich imprisons its Emanation becomes solipsistic and hermaphroditic. Once theEmanation achieves outwardness, it must not escape so far as to become alienatedfrom the self. This would be the erotic perversity of female flight andconcealment, by which woman dominates man. Spiritual health is the correctpositioning of self to Emanation, in loving marriage. The archenemy of happyunion between self and Emanation is the Spectre, whom Blake identifies withrationalism. One may be turned into a Spectre by the desertion of one’sEmanation. But just as often, the Spectre pursues and haunts the self. Blake’sSpectre is always male. Hence it is an early example of the nineteenth-centurydoppelgänger, like the stern double tracking Poe’s William Wilson. Whendominated by the Spectre, the self becomes a hermaphroditic Selfhood, whom Blakecalls Satan or Death. In this state, the created world is at its most remote anddensely material or contracted.Until commentary becomes simpler and more persuasive, Blake’s long poems willlanguish unread, known only by Blake specialists, the same parochializationsuffered by Spenser. It should be immediately evident—though nowhere pointed outin central Blake studies—that Blake’s Spectres and Emanations are equivalent tothe ghosts of the contemporaneous Gothic novel. The late eighteenth century wasthe end of something and the beginning of something. The disintegration of theApollonian Enlightenment produced a psychic fragmentation or splintering. In thestatic psychology of the early eighteenth century, character was constructed ofbuilding blocks of fixed “qualities.” A century earlier, Donne illustrated therational unity and simplicity of the Christian model of personality in “HolySonnet I,” where the soul is tugged up toward heaven and down toward hell, whilethe poet looks forward toward death and backward toward his sinful life.Directions are resolutely foursquare, like a compass. The moral universe isgeometrically coherent and intelligible. In Blake, however, there is no up ordown. Tracks of emotional force are not rectangular but spiral: Mannerist imagesof the “Vortex” recur. The Spectre veers off at an eccentric angle from theself. Blake’s fluid world is full of disjunctions of scale, gross expansions andstifling diminutions. It has the spongy relativism of modern physics.In Blake the soul has split, so that the prophetic poems ask what is the “true”self. This is a new question in history, more sweeping than the multipleimpersonations of the Renaissance, where social order was still a moral value.In Blake, territorial war is waged among parts of the self. His characters arein identity crisis, Rousseau’s invention. In his Spectres and Emanations, Blakeis doing allegorically what the nineteenth-century novel will donaturalistically, documenting the modulations of emotion. Blake rejectsJudeo-Christian morality. Nevertheless, he wants to integrate sexuality withright action. But sex, which Christianity correctly assigns to the daemonicrealm, always escapes moral control. The paradoxes of Blake’s eerie Gothicpsychodrama of Spectre and Emanation arise from the impossibility of hismission: to redeem sex from its miring in mother nature.Fallen Experience constantly generates phantom selves which cloud perception.Parodic pregnancies abound in Blake. The failure to emanate is like a perverselyprolonged pregnancy, where being is choked. Blake’s psychodrama takes the formof unnatural sex acts of bizarre surrealism. Blake is Sade’s peer in sexualimagination. Take, for example, Los’s capture of his fleeing Emanation,Enitharmon: “Eternity shudder’d when they saw, / Man begetting his likeness, /On his own divided image” (Urizen 19:14–16). I am impatient with criticalover-stress of the allegory here, where Los is time and Enitharmon space. On theprimary emotional level of poetry, we see a violent public sex act, from whichthe horrified universe cannot avert its eyes. Incestuous self-insemination: thegrappling duo is a new Khepera, the masturbatory Egyptian cosmos-maker. Actorsand audience are a sexual octopus of many legs and many eyes.The contest between male Spectre and female Emanation is archaic ritual combat.I find homosexual overtones in the betrayal of the self into a queasy spectralworld ruled by dark, deceiving male figures. Note the elegance with whichBlake’s Spectre theory fits Shakespeare’s Othello. A conspiratorial Spectre,Iago, is homoerotically obsessed with splitting Othello, through jealous fears,from his Emanation, Desdemona. (Jealousy and fear are the Spectres’ regularweapons.) Othello, cleaving to his Spectre instead of casting him off, destroyshimself. He ends by killing not his Spectre but his Emanation. Another exampleis Joseph Losey’s film, The Servant (1963, screenplay by Harold Pinter from anovel by Robin Maugham). An upper-class bachelor is dominated by a homosexuallyinsinuating male Spectre, his housekeeper and valet (Dirk Bogarde), who coollyand systematically drives away the master’s fiancée. The fiancée, Blake’sEmanation, is the master’s link with reality. Severed from her, he sinks beneaththe Spectre’s power into enervation and decadence, Blake’s solipsism. In Blake,the self must choose between joyous heterosexual marriage with a femaleEmanation or evil homosexual bonding with a male Spectre. Homosexuality isnegative and narcissistic for Blake because it evades the fruitful opposition ofsexual contraries.Blake’s fallen world is full of delusive personae, like swindling “bubble”speculations of the nineteenth century. Vala, for example, is a taxidermicdecoy, like Spenser’s False Florimell. She vampiristically captures and absorbsAlbion’s libidinal energy. The self must make its way past frauds andextortionists who lure the psyche into committing spiritual capital to unsoundinvestments. Blake sees sexual personae as false advertisement. As a moralist,Blake is a spiritualist. As a sexualist, he is a materialist. Never the twainshall meet. Arguments with one’s self make art. Blake’s poetry is border strife,communiques from the endless guerrilla war between sex and good intentions.The “Hermaphrodites” of Blake’s prophetic poems may be the most shrilly negativeandrogynes in literature and art. Blake’s attitude toward sexually dual figuresis mixed, since he thinks of prelapsarian man as androgynous. Crabb Robinsonreported a “rambling” conversation with Blake about life before and after theFall: the poet spoke of “a union of sexes in man as in Ovid, an androgynousstate, in which I could not follow him.” For Blake, the sexes should be fusedonly in the unfallen world. Albion, like the Kabbalistic Adam Kadmon, containsboth sexes because he precedes history. When history stops, Albion will regainhis dual gender.Though he may allude to a primeval hermaphrodite, Blake puts little stress on itin his poetry. Of far more import are the monstrous hermaphrodites ofExperience. The hermaphroditic Satan, “black & opake,” hides the male within him“as in a Tabernacle Abominable Deadly” (Four Zoas 101, II:33–37). Tabernaclesand arks, like crystal cabinets, are evil because Blake opposes everythinghidden or set aside in special holiness. Satan is a mutation of the GreatMother. He is “unformd & vast,” like the chaos of archaic night before the birthof the eye. Blake’s hermaphrodites are negative for the same reason they arepositive for the French and English Decadence: their imperious self-containment.The hermaphrodite’s inability to mate and its incapacity for emotional openingare moral defects for Blake, who says, “The most sublime act is to set anotherbefore you” (Marriage of Heaven and Hell). The hermaphrodite is severe sexualclosure. Satan is a black hole of super-dense matter, a spiralling convolutionof psyche. He is spiritually blocked.Blake’s war at Jerusalem’s Gate is a vast “aggregate” hermaphrodite or“Polypus,” heaving like an earthquake (Four Zoas 104, II:19–21, 56:14–16). ThisWagnerian passage is a great epiphany of the Dionysian androgyne. Chthonianspasms give birth to the “monstrous” deformity, Satan. Swirling, swarming mobsare a single writhing being. Baudelaire uses a similar effect in “A Carcass,”where seething maggots rise and fall like a wave. Blake’s surreal warpings ofperspective resemble Vergil’s in his grotesque Rumor, tyrant of city life.Hermaphrodite war and hermaphroditic Satan, spawned by daemonic parthenogenesis,belong to the category of androgyne I call the moral monstrosity.A reverse image of Satan’s birth occurs in Milton, where the poet-hero returnsfrom Eden to become his own hermaphrodite Shadow. There are labor pains ofingress, as dead Milton forces the ribbon of time to run backwards so he mayrevise his life work. Milton, as if in masquerade, assumes hermaphrodite costumeto recover his Emanation, Ololon. He is like Odysseus disguised as a beggar tofree his Emanation, Penelope, from captivity in their house usurped by Spectres.Milton faces the Blakean sexual crux, a choice between a blissful bride and amale double (Satan). Milton’s quest for his Emanation requires separating herfrom her own tendency toward hermaphroditism. She is at a sexual crossroads,like the Greek fork where Oedipus slew Laius. Milton must capture his Emanationbefore she takes the road to Delphi, where she will become, like Alice, anomnipotent queen. Hermaphrodite Milton is tempted by orgiastic apparitions sentby the malevolent nature goddesses, Rahab and Tirzah. These hermaphrodites,“Double-sexed; / The Female-male & the Male-female,” have an Apollonian beautyglowing against chthonian darkness, like Lucifer in The Monk (19:32–33). Theyflash with the neon luridness of urban prostitution, homosexual andheterosexual. Milton is being confronted with his ambivalence about sex.In Jerusalem, in one of the most daring assaults upon the masculine in all ofBlake, Vala denounces Los: “The Human is but a Worm, & thou O Male: Thou art /Thyself Female, a Male: a breeder of Seed: a Son & Husband: & Lo. / The HumanDivine is Womans Shadow, a Vapor in the summers heat. … O Woman-born / AndWoman-nourishd & Woman-educated & Woman-scorn’d!” (64:12–17). A gianthermaphrodite suddenly forms, and the colors of crimson wrath, green jealousy,and purple frustration vibrate in the heavy air. The united beings loom over theThames like a colossus, a toxic mushroom cloud. Vala as nature denies the maleexists as a separate sex. He is merely a subset to woman. Nature shrinks man toher adolescent son-lover. Vala’s torrent of abuse resembles the hectoring verbalattacks of female upon cowering male in Lawrence’s Women in Love and the filmsAll About Eve and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? I invent a special category ofthe androgyne, the Venus Barbata, for such strident termagants.One of Los’s tasks in Jerusalem is to break apart false hermaphrodite forms torelease their male and female energy. He pounds them on his anvil, asserting theaggression of masculine will. Los has to halt the careening orgy of theDaughters of Albion, who “divide & unite at will” as, “naked & drunk,” they pourthrough the London streets (58:1–2). The Daughters of Albion seem to clonethemselves and make love to their own mirror images. Lesbianism is also impliedin the physical intimacy of Jerusalem and Vala, surely illustrated in theintroductory plate to the second chapter, which speaks of “unnaturalconsanguinities and friendships” (19:40–41, 28:7). Los’s hammer blows are theharsh metrical accents of poetry, imagination escaping and defeating nature’sorganic rhythms. His beats are the renewed strife of contraries, the source ofBlakean energy stunted by premature hermaphrodite fusings. Malevolent naturetries to reduce all objects to sameness, the infancy of history.Commentary on Blake’s hermaphrodites is scanty and confusing. The receivedinterpretations are theories, not proven solutions. In his Blake Dictionary, J.Foster Damon, following Milton O. Percival, makes a distinction betweenhermaphrodite and androgyne that makes no sense whatever to me. Damon andPercival believe the sexes are equal in the androgyne but that the femaledominates in the hermaphrodite.7 [ch25_notes.html#ch10note7a] But the latteridea comes from Ovid’s embroidered tale of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus,extremely late in mythological tradition. The words hermaphrodite and androgyneshould be virtually synonymous. The only distinction might be to see thehermaphrodite as genitally dual but the androgyne as sexually ambiguous in face,hair, frame, clothes, manner, or spirit. But even this is an unnecessary split.Why are androgynes horrific in Blake’s poetry? Of the English Romantics, Blakeis the most oriented toward the patriarchal Old Testament, which purgesfemaleness out of God. Like Dante and Spenser, Blake sees metamorphichermaphroditism as evil. His loathsome hermaphrodites may be a tweaking ofMilton’s and Swedenborg’s noses. In Milton’s heaven, angels change gender andhave sex in perfect purity, their soft bodies “dilated or condens’t” at will(P.L. I.423–31, VIII.615–29). But Blake denies there can be happiness in a realmthat devalues the sexual body as grossly material. Blake’s hermaphrodites makeMiltonic couplings, clotting and splitting at staccato pace. Their solipsism maybe a satire on Milton’s angels, whom Blake views as passive, sterile jellies. InMilton’s heaven, like unites with like, for Blake a dead end of narcissism.What Blake most abhors in Milton’s angelic intercourse is its dissolution ofoutline, as the boneless entities meet and merge. This I see as the main reasonfor his hostility to hermaphrodites. Blake is the only major poet who is also anartist. The central reference point of his poetry and drawings is “the HumanForm Divine,” specifically the male form, with which Blake identifies humanimagination struggling to free itself from female nature. Like Michelangelo,Blake gives female figures a masculine musculature. Because Blake knewMichelangelo’s work only from engravings, his Michelangelo-inspired modellinghas a sinewy hardness, like Signorelli’s. Blake blames Venetian and Flemishpainting for “losing the outlines.” There must be “firm and determinateoutline”: “The great and golden rule of art, as well as of life, is this: Thatthe more distinct, sharp, and wirey the bounding line, the more perfect the workof art; and the less keen and sharp, the greater is the evidence of weakimitation, plagiarism, and bungling…. How do we distinguish the oak from thebeech, the horse from the ox, but by the bounding outline? How do we distinguishone face or countenance from another, but by the bounding line and its infiniteinflexions and movements?”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch10note8a]Blake’s “hard and wirey line of rectitude” is the sharp Apollonian contour Ihave traced to the incised edges of Egyptian art. It is Blake’s barrier againstnature, a perceptual device by which objects and persons gain their identity.Spenser too identifies virtue with sharp-edged personality, and sloth and vicewith melting dissolution of form. Blake condemns “blotting and blurring” in art,“broken lines, broken masses, and broken colours.” He calls chiaroscuro,originating in Leonardo’s ambiguous sfumato, “that infernal machine,” crankingout the murk of hell.9 [ch25_notes.html#ch10note9a]The androgyne seemed benign to Blake the less clearly he thought about it: hencehis obscure “rambling” to Robinson. As soon as Blake actually visualized theandrogyne, it became a horror. Explicitly hermaphroditic figures are repugnantto him for the same reason they were to high classic Greek artists, who avoideddepicting mutilations or monstrosities. For Blake the hermaphrodite offendsagainst the virtuous optical integrity of the human form. The same zeal movedSpenser to cancel his “Hermaphrodite stanzas.” Blake abandoned the few drawingshe attempted of the hermaphrodite, and he has his own rejected hermaphroditestanzas, two fragments about Tharmas and his Emanation which were never includedin The Four Zoas. Thus Blake’s hostility to the hermaphrodite has two sources,ethical and aesthetic. Male and female as principles of energy must not losetheir autonomy in torpid self-absorption. Second, the visionary clarity of theunitary human form must not be defiled by grotesque hybridization.Blake’s art theory extends to his view of personality. We can distinguish oneface from another. Blake says, only by the bounding borderline, without which“all is chaos again.” There is an undertow in nature, sucking phenomena back toprimeval nondifferentiation. Personality maintains its discreteness by an act ofwill. Otherwise one person will flow helplessly into another. Both Spenser andBlake hate the amorphous. But Blake’s anxiety is obsession. His insistence onthe bounding line is like Dr. Johnson’s compulsion to touch fence posts as hewalked. Blake says, “Nature has no Outline” (“The Ghost of Abel”). Bloom speaksof Blake’s Rahab as “mother of the indefinite, queen of the abyss of objectswithout contour, lines without clear outline.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch10note10a]Looking at a smoky, coloristic painting, Blake feels he is looking into Rahab’sabyss.Blake says chiaroscuro makes a painting “all blocked up with brown shadows.”Though Rubens’ “original conception was all fire and animation, he loads it withhellish brownness, and blocks up all its gates of light.” Blake uses “clearcolours unmudded by oil.” Mud, hellish brownness: excrement. Blake confirms thisassociation elsewhere when he calls Rubens’ coloring “most Contemptible”: “HisShadows are of a Filthy Brown somewhat of the Colour of Excrement.”11[ch25_notes.html#ch10note11a] Hellish brownness is the belly and bowels ofmother nature, the labyrinth where the Apollonian eye is lost. Blake’s mud isprimal ooze, the chthonian swamp of generation. In Spenser and Blake, the selfmust be constructed and sustained against demoralizing relaxations (laxness ofline). Personality is architectonic. Without virile force, the self slips backinto the dissolution of swampy female nature.Blake says a weak bounding line is evidence of plagiarism. Bloom’s anxiety ofinfluence: by firmness of line, one defends oneself against an overwhelmingprecursor. Who is the ultimate precursor? The Great Original, mother nature, whodelegates her authority to our individual mothers. Blake’s bounding lineexpresses a gnawing need for self-origination. It is a territorial strategy, bywhich the male separates himself from his female source. Like Jesus, Blakedefies his mother: “Then what have I to do with thee?” (“To Tirzah”). When Blakesays faces are indistinguishable without the bounding line, the two facesthreatening to collapse into each other, as in the dream climax of Bergman’sPersona, are those of mother and son.Blake’s scorn for chiaroscuro is related to his resentment of the hidden andsecret. He boldly calls for an end to shame about the genitals; he wants themflooded in the light of Glad Day, with its exuberant nudity. Alas, sexualopenness applies only to men. A man can walk vigorously free on the earth,exposing his genitals without self-consciousness or guilt. But a woman’sgenitals are not visible when she stands or walks. To expose herself, she mustlie on her back or squat over the observer’s face! In other words, she must takea position of submission or dominance, as in a primitive statuette or cult act.Man is either gynecologist or supine asphyxiate. The female body can never bemade completely visible; it will always be a dark, secret place. I applied KarenHorney’s remark on woman’s inability to see her genitals to my theory of theGreek male nude, which I interpret as a projected genital. Embodying everyemotion in titanic human form, Blake’s long poems are a psychic gigantism, acompulsive externalization inspired by the desire to abolish the secrecy ofwoman’s reproductive matrix. Gigantism is distinctively masculine, as inMichelangelo and Goethe. Gigantism in a woman is transsexualizing, transmutingthe female self by male potency. The desire to turn male is latent in twoexamples of female gigantism, Emily Brontë’s Heathcliff and Rosa Bonheur’s vast,muscular painting, Horse Fair.Blake’s supreme desire is to free sex from the tyrannical nature mother. One ofmy central theses is that sex and parturition occur in the liquid realm. Art isa flight from liquidity in its manufacture of discrete objects defying theirorigins. Blake’s extraordinary rhetorical energy and enormity of assertion comefrom his revulsion from the femaleruled liquid condition of physical life. TheGreek beautiful boy, I said, is imagination freed from nature, but his freedomis attained through sexual renunciation, chastity. Blake desires freeimagination, but he exalts eroticism and makes chastity a perversion. This isimpossible. There can be no active sexuality without surrender to nature and toliquidity, the realm of the mother. Blake wants nature bound but sex unbound.Sex is chthonian, but as artist and man Blake seeks the Apollonian. Before thesymbolism of his prophetic books was analyzed, Blake used to be called “mad.”This was obviously wrong. Yet in the long poems there is a hysteria or excessunacknowledged by criticism. Art is born of stress, not repose. Art is always aswerve from primary experience. Blake’s long poems are full of knots, breaches,and strains. They are held together by force of will, like an ancient monument(the Porch of the Maidens) sutured by iron rods. Blake’s lack of completeintelligibility comes from his philosophical discontinuities. His hopeless butheroic task, to redeem sex from nature, is a western epic saga.Translating him into moral terms, criticism is at odds with how Blake’s poetryfeels. Bloom presents Blake as a man of peace who hates war. But Blake’sprophetic poetry is war, violent, terrible. His long poems seethe withhostility, of which his obsession with mother nature is but one example. As Iread the accumulated criticism, I keep asking, why is Blake a poet rather than aphilosopher, if everything he wrote reduces so neatly to these manifest ideas?Blake scholarship denies there is a latent content. In life as in art, moralflag-waving may conceal a repressed attraction to what is being denounced.Blake’s treatment of women is full of ambivalences. Here is his model of thefuture: “In Eternity Woman is the Emanation of Man she has No Will of her ownThere is no such thing in Eternity as a Female Will” (A Vision of the LastJudgment). It is not enough to say all Blake’s females are nature and all hismales are man and woman together. Whenever gender is symbolized, we must askwhy. As long as imagination is formed by culture, it may be impossible to freethe sexes from their inherited meanings in art. I am not particularly vexed byBlake’s negative female symbols, since I am too aware of a contradictory latentcontent breaking through. So stunning a vision of nature as The Mental Travelleris not produced by someone secure in the triumph of male imagination. In A Roomof One’s Own, Virginia Woolf satirically describes her perplexity at the bulgingcard catalog of the British Museum: why, she asks, are there so many bookswritten by men about women but none by women about men? The answer to herquestion is that from the beginning of time men have been struggling with thethreat of woman’s dominance. The flood of books was prompted not by woman’sweakness but by her strength, her complexity and impenetrability, her dreadfulomnipresence. No man has yet been born, even Jesus himself, who was not spunfrom a pitiful speck of plasma to a conscious being on the secret loom within awoman’s body. That body is the cradle and soft pillow of woman’s love, but it isalso the torture rack of nature.Blake seems to be the one Romantic who denies the femme fatale’s power over him.But this is his propaganda, not reality. Even Los’s activity is the hammeringheart of sex fear. In one of the most spectacular passages in Blake’s poetry,the naked Daughters of Albion perform a grim ritual of nature cult. They hunkeron a stone altar, the rock landscape of The Mental Traveller. With a flintknife, castration tool of the Great Mother, they gash the howling male victim.His blood stains their white bodies. They thrust their fingers in his heart;they pour cold water on his brain and lid his eyes. “Glowing with beauty &cruelty: / They obscure the sun & the moon; no eye can look upon them.” Onedrinks the blood of her “panting Victim.” He pants because he is a deer caughtby an eerily unwinded Diana. The sex act has drained him. Woman soaks up maleenergy for her insatiable pleasure and pride (Jer 66:16–34, 68:11–12).The Daughters of Albion are so superbly glamourous and the whole terrifyingscene so astoundingly visualized that we must ask whether such things in Blakereally come from militant resistance to the femme fatale. I fail to seesignificant differences between this passage and the erotic vampire poems ofBaudelaire. Surely there is secret delectation in Blake’s vivid detailing ofeach step of the prostrate male’s torture. This is a great flight ofsadomasochistic poetry. I feel very strongly in it Blake’s shiver of voluptuousidentification with the humiliated victim. It prefigures Whitman’s keeningsexual litanies. The manifest content of the passage is that nature is pitilessand tyrannical. The latent content is that Blake’s excess of opposition to the“Female Will” springs from his attraction to her and from the danger of hisimminent surrender.Blake’s sexual vulnerability is only to chthonian androgynes, the Great Motherand her subset, the vampire. The Amazon figure severed from sexuality offers noarchetypal danger to him; hence his stern rejection of her is uncomplicated.Blake’s virginity is a haughty, solitary Artemis, like Spenser’s Belphoebe.Apollonian Elynittria, “the silver bowed queen,” has a “terrible” light and“immortal beauty,” driving off trespassers with her silver arrows (Eur 8:4; Mil12:1, 11:37–38). Blake finds immature the self-sequestration of Spenserianvirginity. Significantly, his crowded painting of The Faerie Queene omits bothBelphoebe and Britomart. Blake has a nightmare vision of Amazon legions on themove, modelled on Milton’s demon army. Thousands of women march over “burningwastes of Sand,” as blazing lightning strikes their armoured shoulders (FourZoas 70:21–23). Virginity, burning with repressed desire, is a hot thin soilwhere nothing grows. Blake’s war against female hegemony extends even to hisMuse. He claimed he took dictation from the spirit of his dead brother, who diedat nineteen. Thus Blake has a male Muse, an extraordinary aberration in thehistory of poetry. Milton bizarrely descends into Blake’s foot in hisgarden—poetic destiny transmitted from one male to another, without the Muse’smediation. Blake will not let femaleness touch him on any side.Blake, unlike Wordsworth, is chock-full of characters, who are the very stuff ofhis poetry. But he is not concerned with personality as such. His characters aregeneralized and typological. Blake is interested in universal, not idiosyncraticexperience. In the huge corpus of his art work, there are few portraits, andthese are usually caricatures or grotesques. Blake resembles Michelangelo in hisindifference to the portrait mode, a medium of social personae. Manners arerituals, which Blake opposes in society or religion as mechanical formulasimposed on the spontaneous and organic. Ironically, in dispensing with socialritualism, Blake left himself open to the far more brutal sadomasochisticritualism of sex and nature, which became his favorite poetic style. Like D. H.Lawrence, Blake wants sex to transcend social names and identities. Also likeLawrence, he desires a return to naturalness without succumbing to nature. InBlake’s world, the mere appearance of a persona is a sign of disease. A mask isa moral husk.Blake attacks all hierarchies. There is no great chain of being in his poetry;nothing is holier than anything else. But Blake’s bounding line is an Apollonianand hence hierarchical principle. I noted that Blake is against dissolution ofform, the Dionysian force destroying hierarchy in Euripides’ Medea and Bacchae.Despite his bounding line, Blake opposes centripetal identity as solipsistic.Urizen, for example, is “self-closd, all-repelling” (Urizen 3:3). Here thebounds of self are too firm. Blake’s most famous drawing is the centrifugal GladDay, athletic Albion with arms flung wide, a symbol of the free energy Blakeloves. Free energy is Dionysian. One cannot be simultaneously for contour andfor sexuality, since sexuality by its very nature is an abridgement of contour.Two people making love are the beast with two backs. The most perfectlycontoured personalities in literature and art are those Apollonian angels ofchastity whom Blake despises for their coldness and exclusivity.These irreconcilable contradictions arise from Blake’s violent yoking togetherof two opposing systems, the Bible and the visual arts. As a graphic artist,Blake is already beyond Old Testament Judaism, which condemns image-making asidolatry. The Ten Commandments forbid pictures of all kinds—of animals, fish, orgods. This is a Hebrew strategy against pagan fertility cults, which sawdivinity in nature. Yahweh’s injunction diverted Jewish creative energy awayfrom the visual arts into theology, philosophy, literature, law, and science, bywhich the Jews have made a stunning impact on world culture, far outweighingtheir small numbers. Blake’s eccentric psychology comes from the fact that he isa strange combination of artist and Hebrew prophet.Blake rejects Greco-Roman literature and exalts the Bible, whose psychology headopts. There are no sexual personae in the Bible, except among harlots.Biblical character is unitary and homogeneous. Psychic splits are of the “whitedsepulcher” kind, where the self is cleanly divided into visible and invisiblehalves. Multiplicity is just the moral duality of a fair face concealing a foulheart. The self breaks down no finer than this. Metamorphosis is reserved forseraphs; God and demons make marvels, turning into a pillar of fire or bouncinginto a pig. There is no suggestion of the turbulent welter of impulses inEuripides’ Medea. The Bible is unconcerned with mystery of motivation. Pharaoh’shardness of heart is stupidity and self-destructiveness, the donkey halting inits track. Saul’s envy is an exception—but perhaps a chunk of the story hasvanished along the way.Classical personality, in contrast, is a theatrical projection of self. Atremendous amount of imaginative energy was invested in the construction ofpersona. It is in the persona that honor resides, and offenses against honorrequire revenge, a principle still colorfully operative among the Mafia.Classical psychology, revived in the Renaissance, lingers on in Italian culture,where persona is called figura (as in “cutting a figure”). In the Bible,individuals are inseparable from their acts. Matthew Arnold says, “The uppermostidea with Hebraism is conduct and obedience.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch10note12a]That Biblical personality exists in and for moral action makes sense inasmuch asthe Bible is a chronicle, the record of a chosen people moving through history.While action is important in classical culture, the persona is separate from andgreater than acts. No value inheres in an action unless one is seen performingit. The Greek gods certainly don’t give a fig, unless their personal vanity isinvolved. Hence the act is merely instrumental, common clay in the sculpting ofpersona, which is a public work of art. Blake seeks out the Hebrew roots ofcharacter and tries to throw off the classical theatrical persona. But theHebrew view of personality as moral content creates a tension in his poetry withthe Greek view of personality as visible formal contour, to which Blake is drawndespite himself, because of his artist’s eye. In his indictment of the GreatMother, Blake writes like St. Augustine, as if she were an immediate threat.Thus his poetry recreates the historical situation in which the Jews warred withEgypt, Babylon, and Rome.Despite his apparent radicalism, Blake is deeply conservative about personality.He is obsessed with the subject, because he stands on the threshold of one ofthe great leaps in western culture in number and volatility of sexual personae.The last had been at the Renaissance. With the intuition of genius, Blake feelsthe forces at work in the late eighteenth century which will produce the chaoticproliferation of modern personalities. Like Spenser, Blake tries to halt thebreakdown into multiplicity of personae. With the Apollonian bounding line, hewants to bind up the self into honesty, to ban all psychic fictions. But asBlake pursues his moral quest, the principal tools which come to hand arefeverishly propagating Spectres and Emanations. Their thronging presence in hisriven poetry makes it symptomatic in literary history of the very fragmentationit condemns."},{"pageContent":"11MARRIAGE TO MOTHER NATUREWordsworthWilliam Wordsworth, not William Blake, defined nature for nineteenth-centuryculture. Visiting France in the early 1790s, Wordsworth read and admiredRousseau. Disillusioned by the French Revolution’s moral degeneration, he turnedaway from politics toward nature, the focus of his hopes. Nature’s inability tosustain him emotionally becomes one of Wordsworth’s sad themes. From first tolast, he sees nature with Rousseau’s eyes. Wordsworth’s refusal to acknowledgethe sex or cruelty in nature is one source of the palpable repression in hispoetry, which constricts and weighs it down. This repression, approachingdepressiveness, accounts for Wordsworth’s lack of appeal to young readers, whoare drawn to energy, not to mention lust. Wordsworth’s sexlessness is notneurotic failing but conceptual strategy. He must renounce sex in order not tosee or feel nature’s sadism. Blake wants sex without nature. Wordsworth wantsnature without sex. As Rousseau is answered by Sade, so is Wordsworthanswered—by his friend and colleague, Coleridge. There is a harsh sexualsymbiosis between the two men: Wordsworth displaces onto Coleridge what hehimself cannot acknowledge in nature. From Coleridge comes the savage line ofnineteenth-century pornographic daemonism, Poe and Hawthorne to Baudelaire,Wilde, and James. The bitter war between Wordsworth and Coleridge goes on for ahundred years.Wordsworth’s first principle is “wise passiveness,” a feminine receptivityopening us to nature. In “Expostulation and Reply,” from Wordsworth andColeridge’s revolutionary Lyrical Ballads (1798), a friend chides the poet fordreaming his time away. Wordsworth replies that the eye sees, the ear hears, andour bodies feel “against or with our will.” Unknown “Powers” play upon us. Thesepowers are chthonian, but Wordsworth severs them from their ancient connectionto sex and barbarism. Reality is active, the poet contemplative, dominated bynature. The poem is a manifesto of sexual dissent, a withdrawal from thetraditional masculine sphere of action and achievement. It starts a movement inmodern literature leading to Melville’s self-entombed Bartleby (“I would prefernot to”) and Kafka’s crippled cockroach, Gregor Samsa. Wordsworth forfeitsmaleness for spiritual union with mother nature: wholeness throughself-mutilation. His poetry revives the ritualism of the Asiatic mother-cults,whose priests castrated themselves for the goddess.In a companion poem, Wordsworth denies we can learn anything from books, thatis, from the words of other men. Instead, “Let Nature be your teacher.”Intellect “mis-shapes” beauty: “We murder to dissect.” All you need is a heartthat “watches and receives” (“The Tables Turned”). As in Dante, reason cannotlead us to ultimate truth. Wordsworth’s reason is brutal and uncreative. Murderby dissection means analysis is masculine, penetrating and killing. Intellect istoo aggressive. The heart “receives” knowledge as a bride opens to her husband.The poet’s sex reversal is unmistakable: his shadowy Powers appear here asfemale nature. The male perfects himself by shamanistic sacrifice of virility.When he is completely passive, nature showers him with gifts. He is holy newbornand she Madonna and Magi. There is nothing negative in the teacher. Thus therecan be nothing negative in the lesson. This was Wordsworth’s major error.The Rousseauist family romance of mother and child is explicit throughoutWordsworth. In The Recluse he calls himself a “nursling of the mountains” tamedby female nature, who turns him from “Warrior’s Schemes” and tells him, “Bemild, and cleave to gentle things” (726–45). Enlightenment means androgyny.Nature is man’s model. Since she is female, he must become feminine. Thisinternalization of femininity is celebrated in the last book of The Prelude,where the heart of the spiritually evolved male is “tender as a nursing mother’sheart” and his life full of “female softness,” “humble cares and delicatedesires, / Mild interests and gentlest sympathies” (XIV.225–31). A man reachesthe height of moral understanding through psychic transsexualism. His inner lifeis colonized by feminine emotions and experiences. Intuitive vision istrancelike removal from the active body. Wordsworth calls it “that serene andblessed mood,” a yogic suspension of breath and blood: “We are laid asleep / Inbody, and become a living soul.” The aggressive western eye is “made quiet” as“We see into the life of things” (Tintern Abbey). There is no gender in purecontemplativeness, since there is no gender-defining body, now neutralized andtranscended.Wordsworth systematically suppresses the body, the medium of masculine action.When Peter Bell’s hardhearted protagonist reforms, his joy turns to tears,melting “his nerves, his sinews”: “Through all his iron frame was felt / Agentle, a relaxing, power!” Fibers weakened, he is helpless, “mild and gentle asan infant child.” The iron frame of masculine architecture is dissolved byfeminine emotion, restoring childhood innocence. Like Goethe’s Werther,Wordsworth identifies masculinity with corrupt adulthood. He is amending andreversing The Faerie Queene. Wordsworth welcomes melting relaxation for the samereason Spenser abhors it: because it is a feminizing deconstruction of the malewill. Wordsworth’s ideal is a Bower of Bliss in overhanging nature. He seeksDionysian deliquescence without sex. Wordsworth wants to prolong childhoodemotional purity into genderless adulthood. Is this a Puritan bequest? Emotionwithout eroticism is impossible.The poet is a “gentle creature” with a female mind, happiest when sitting“brooding” like a “mother dove.” At Cambridge, Wordsworth was as “sensitive” tonature’s changes as waters to the sky. He was “obedient as a lute” waiting for“the touches of the wind” (Pre I.135–41, III. 138–39). Wordsworth often callsriver or sea a female “bosom” or “breast.” So if he is water, he is female, asin ancient cosmogonies which imagine female earth inseminated by male sky.Erotic passivity is implicit in Romanticism’s favorite topos of the Aeolianwind-harp, here a lute symbolizing the artist’s subordination to nature’sinspiring power.Wordsworth’s descriptions of mental processes are sexually tinged. The mind is“lord and master”; the senses are “obedient servant of her will” (PreXII.222–23). Mind is a dominatrix. The poet’s inner life is womblike: “Cavernsthere were within my mind which sun / Could never penetrate” (III.246–47).Wordsworth uses “pregnancy” and “impregnation” in nonsexual contexts. The cavernimage appears in two of The Prelude’s, major passages. Crossing the Alps,Wordsworth thinks of imagination as an “awful Power” that “rose from the mind’sabyss / Like an unfathered vapour” (VI.594–95). Geoffrey Hartman saysimagination is unfathered because “self-begotten.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note1a]The mind in its abyss is a double-sexed earth mother, fertilizing herselfwithout male help. Imagination is unfathered because it shuns the prickingstimulus of male reason; its sole parent is female intuition. The poet is likethe Delphic oracle maddened by vapors. Wordsworth reverts to matriarchalconsciousness, receiving signals from earth and heart, rather than sky andbrain. Hartman finds “sexual or birth-channel implications” in Wordsworth’simages of “narrow chasm,” “gloomy strait,” and “dark deep thoroughfare.”2[ch25_notes.html#ch11note2a] Ascending Mount Snowdon, Wordsworth sees a mindfeeding upon infinity, brooding over “the dark abyss” (XIV.70–72). The mind asmother dove broods upon its own inner cavern. Paradise Lost opens with Godsitting “brooding on the vast Abyss” to make it “pregnant” (I.21–22).Wordsworth’s maternal poetic consciousness takes over God’s powers andprivileges.Eye and ear, Wordsworth says in Tintem Abbey, not only “perceive” but “halfcreate.” There should be “balance” and harmony between “the objects seen, andeye that sees.” Wordsworth wants to blunt the aggressive western eye withoutdarkening it in solipsism. He scorns as “passive minds” those failing to see the“affinities” and “brotherhood” between men and natural things (Pre XIII.375–78,II.384–86). This negative use of “passive” is unexpected. Wordsworth assails“Presumption, folly, madness, in the men / Who thrust themselves upon thepassive world / As Rulers of the world” (Pre XIII.66–68). As Hitler said, themasses are feminine. Wordsworth’s thrusting, self-erected rulers rape thepeople. “One maternal spirit” fills the world, except where man is unjustly made“a tool or implement, a passive thing” (The Excursion IX. 111–16). Badgovernment is against nature. In Wordsworth’s play, The Borderers, “the tyrannyof the world’s masters” lives only “in the torpid acquiescence of emasculatedsouls” (III.354–57). Dominance requires submission. Political power issadomasochistic sex. In a sonnet of 1803, Wordsworth urges England to “wean” itsheart from “its emasculating food.” England is on its knees, sucking from thewrong sex and the wrong spigot.Wordsworth’s negative, emasculated passivity occurs when men subordinatethemselves not to maternal female nature but to other men. Acceptance ofpolitical tyranny is a betrayal of divine mother love. Modern social man is amoral catamite, like Pope’s court-enamoured Sporus. Hence Wordsworth, likeBlake, has his own sexual crux. A man may choose emasculation in the service ofthe state, stultifying his imagination, or he may choose marriage with a mothergoddess. But who is the bride, who the groom? Wordsworth, son and spouse, isself-eunuchized. Male-defending Blake would denounce this marriage and beejected from the church.Wordsworth exalts suffering, as well as perception. “Action is transitory,”merely “the motion of a muscle,” while “Suffering is permanent, obscure, anddark, / And shares the nature of infinity” (Bor III.405–10). Through sufferingone enters Wordsworth’s dark abyss. Suffering is an Eleusinian mystery, achthonian cavern. Action is masculine, suffering feminine. Men’s acts are“transitory,” but the travails of women and woman-identified males are“permanent.” Wordsworth’s sexuality is in dreams of self-immolation.Reviewing the sexual personae of his collected works, we discover Wordsworth’sradical exclusion of one human type: the adult man of active virility. His poemsare filled with children, women, old men, and animals. But a stone in the roadarouses more fellow-feeling in Wordsworth than does a masculine man. Exiles fromsociety automatically win his Rousseauist respect. Since Wordsworth identifiessociety with masculinity, the masculine male, smug victor of the socialsweepstakes, is barred from the poetry. For Blake the Man is everything; forWordsworth he is nothing, a moral zero. Though Wordsworth’s compassion seemsideologically all-inclusive, it is not. The more glaring art’s omissions, thebigger the imaginative swerve. Wordsworth burns with aversion toward virilemales.For Wordsworth’s emotion to flow toward him, a male must suffer some curtailmentof virility. We meet a sailor in “Incidents upon Salisbury Plain,” but he is oldand impoverished. His feet are half bare, his red military coat faded, patched,and torn. He is a murderer and thus, like Cain, doomed to solitary wandering. InThe Prelude Wordsworth meets a tall man in military dress with “a lean andwasted arm”: “a more meagre man / Was never seen before by night or day”(IV.387ff.). Sailor and soldier have been expelled from social hierarchies. Theyare the detritus of a civilization moving obliviously through history. It is fortheir obsolescence and “desolation” that Wordsworth admires them. Another sailorappears in “The Waggoner,” which starts to follow his adventures in asurprisingly straightforward way. Can this be a Wordsworthian virile male? No, ahundred lines later: “Up springs the Sailor from his chair— / Limps (for I mighthave told before / That he was lame) across the floor” (II. 102–04). Men must bemutilated to get into Wordsworth’s poetry. Wordsworth is so used to impairinghis males physically or spiritually that he elides the sailor’s lameness atfirst entrance, leaving the affliction understood as a traumatic assumption ofhis poetic world. Or perhaps he conceives of the sailor as virile but then findshis imagination stiffened by the presence of so strange and sexually obtrusive abeing. He must jump backward to cancel the disturbing implication of maleness.Only after the sailor is hastily lamed in an awkward parenthesis can the poemproceed.An attractive American youth appears in “Elegiac Stanzas” (1820)—but onlybecause he has drowned in the lake at Zurich. In “Vaudracour and Julia,” a youngman violently pursues his love, then retires to a forest to raise hisillegitimate child. The children die because of a mysterious error by thefather, who degenerates into imbecile muteness. Moral: virility slaloms downhillinto squalor. In “Michael,” an eighteen-year-old youth cuts a handsome figure.But the implacable Wordsworth destines him for disaster in “dissolute” London:“ignominy and shame” drive him overseas. The city is Babylon, tempting men tosexual and automatically fallen experience. In “Hart-Leap Well,” a knight buildsa “pleasure-house” where he kills a stag and will play with his “Paramour.” Thepoem equates killing and sex: as in Faust, domination of nature is domination ofwoman. In the second part, the mansion has vanished, and the spot is “curst,”the trees “lifeless stumps.” Phallicism is sterile, an affront to nature.In “The Two April Mornings” and its companion poem, “The Fountain,” aseventy-two-year-old schoolmaster recalls his adulthood as “a vigorous man.”Virility is documented only when lost. It is distanced at several narrativeremoves, memory within memory: the first poem ends with Wordsworth rememberingthe schoolmaster remembering. Virility is contemplated through the bleared lensof age. In “The Last of the Flock,” we meet “a healthy man, a man full grown.”But he is weeping in the road! Once rich, he has sold his fifty sheep to buyfood for his children. Wordsworth turns the flock’s diminishing into a litany ofdwindling manhood: fifty, ten, five, three, two, one, none. Wordsworth’sarithmetic charts the shrinking of patriarchal domain. As his property shrivelsto the borders of his body, the protagonist, like Odysseus or Lear, will soon benobody. His Wordsworthian decline is like Kleist’s male mastectomy inPenthesilea, a surgical reduction of self. Wordsworth empathizes with the virilemale of “The Last of the Flock” because he is suffering and because hismasculine identity is fast approaching the vanishing point. For Wordsworth, aman becomes greater as he becomes less. Self-sacrifice and public martyrdomcanonize him in the cult of female nature.In “Character of the Happy Warrior,” Wordsworth asks, “Who is the happy Warrior?Who is he / That every man in arms should wish to be?” This is virtually thelast we hear about arms, since it turns out that the best warrior “makes hismoral being his prime care.” The poem is a series of precepts more applicable tophilosopher than soldier. In “The Happy Warrior” there is no glamour in action,only in quality of being. Late in his career, Wordsworth added a prefacerevealing the poem had been inspired by Lord Nelson: “But his public life wasstained with one great crime, so that… I have not been able to connect his namewith the poem as I could wish.” The crime was Nelson’s affair with Emma, LadyHamilton. The open but by no means promiscuous sexuality of England’s naval herocaused his name to be struck from the honor roll of Wordsworth’s poetry. WhatByron would praise, Wordsworth condemns. Wordsworth adds that the virtues of thehappy warrior were found in his own brother, a ship’s commander, who died in awreck at sea in 1805. This masculine brother appears by name in Wordsworth’spoetry—but naturally only in “Elegiac Verses” after his death.There is a striking epiphany of virility in The Prelude, a vision coming to theyouthful Wordsworth near Stonehenge. He hears primitive tribes at war and sees“A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin vest, / With shield and stone-axe,” afigure of “barbaric majesty (XIII.312–26). For the first and only time,Wordsworth’s imagination is kindled by a masculine male. But again virilityenters the poetry only as a memory thrust backward in time. The older Wordsworthremembers the young Wordsworth having a racial memory. The fierce Briton belongsto prehistory. He is man-in-nature, outside and prior to contemporary society,the focus of Wordsworth’s hostility. Another example from The Prelude completesour sex survey. In the sunny fresh air, Wordsworth sees a brawny laborercaressing a “sickly babe” on his knee (VII.602–18). Like Praxiteles’ Hermes withinfant Dionysus, Wordsworth’s laborer is kourotrophos, the child-rearer. He is amale mother, the category of androgyne I call Teiresias. Unconsciously, thelaborer has modelled himself upon nature’s maternal spirit. The babe softens hisgender and makes it tolerable for the poet.Thus Wordsworth’s emotion is never invested in figures of active virility,unless that virility is qualified by suffering or feminine feeling or unless itis seen through the distancing perspective of memory. Since femaleness suffusesthe created world, the pure male is cast out. He has no right to life. In orderto matriculate in Wordsworth’s green campus, one must undergo a punishing seriesof entrance exams. Under a special admissions program, women, children, and oldmen have privileged status, as disadvantaged minorities in patriarchal society.Males hoping for acceptance must undergo a perilous rite de passage. They mustsuffer deeply, even die, or they must become mothers. Each option is sexuallytransformative. Etymologically, to matriculate means to enter the realm of womband mother. Wordsworth is the iron chancellor of spiritual matriculation,soaking his beings with tenderizing mother-emotion.What of Wordsworth’s other sexual personae? I conclude that the more emotionallyremote a person is to Wordsworth, the more pictorially detailed. The moreemotionally central, the vaguer and more numinous. The poet calls his futurewife, Mary Hutchinson, “a Phantom of delight,” “a lovely Apparition.” She is “adancing Shape, an Image gay,” “a Spirit, yet a Woman too,” bright with “angeliclight.” The poem begins and ends with Mary as an angel of dissolving gender. InThe Prelude Wordsworth again calls Mary “phantom” and “spirit” (XIV. 268–70).The mysterious Lucy dies into formal indeterminacy, “Rolled round in earth’sdiurnal course, / With rocks, and stones, and trees” (“A Slumber Did My SpiritSeal”). Beyond personality, Lucy is submerged in nature’s Dionysianmetamorphoses—possibly a detail from the climax of Lewis’ The Monk. The angelicMary moves upward in the chain of being, while Lucy moves downward. But bothsuffer the same Wordsworthian fate: their bodies are dematerialized and desexed.Reduced to matter, Lucy loses her gender and human identity.Wordsworth uses the same indeterminacy of form for his sister, Dorothy, by farthe most important person in his life, as he was in hers. After his break withWordsworth, Coleridge tartly called her (in Greek) “thesister-brother-worshipper” or “slave.” In Wordsworth’s poetry, Dorothy isbodiless and sexless. No matter how many times one reads Tintem Abbey, Dorothy’sappearance at the end is always startling. Self-absorbed Wordsworth seems soutterly alone in his reflections and memories. Dorothy suddenly materializes,like a spirit. At first, her gender is unclear: “thou my dearest Friend, / Mydear, dear Friend”—the same abstract honorific Wordsworth uses for Coleridgethroughout The Prelude. Only after eight long lines do we get any informationabout the friend’s sex or identity. Yet Wordsworth is listening to the friend’svoice and looking into “the shooting lights” of the friend’s eyes. For eightlines we are left helplessly free-floating, in sexual suspension. We are askedto hear a voice and look into the eyes of a being of unfixed gender.Dorothy is bodiless and sexless in Tintern Abbey because she is Wordsworth’sJungian anima, an internal aspect of self momentarily projected. Hence hersuddenness of appearance, since for most of the poem’s interior monologue, shehas not really been external to her brother. When Wordsworth hears in Dorothy’svoice “the language of my former heart” and sees his “former pleasures” in hereyes, he seems to be contemplating his twin or double. Bloom calls Dorothy “anincarnation of his earlier self.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note3a] Gazing intoDorothy’s face, Wordsworth is looking into a magic mirror and seeing his pastself. He is like Spenser’s Britomart glimpsing in the crystal ball or mirror herfuture self in sexually transmuted form. Coleridge speaks of a looking-glass asa “Sister Mirror.” Seeing himself in Dorothy’s eyes, Wordsworth is like Donne’slover seeing her reflection mirrored in the poet’s tears. Wordsworth’s eightsexually suspended lines are a moment of psychic parturition in which thesister-spirit emerges from her brother’s male double. The passage records hersystematic coalescence of gender and identity, as she pulls away fromcoextensiveness with her brother, like the moon tearing itself from primevalearth.Dorothy hovers at Wordworth’s side like a tutelary spirit maintaining discreetsilence until summoned. She is ritualistically invoked because Wordsworth needsher to quell a sudden anxiety. He has just completed a history of his relationwith nature since childhood. Now he reaffirms he is still “A lover of themeadows and the woods, / And mountains.” But something has changed. AddressingDorothy, Wordsworth adds parenthetically, “Knowing that Nature never did betray/ The heart that loved her.” This knowing is hope under duress. Dorothy’smaterialization is Wordsworth’s strategy to keep despair at bay. She is avisible symbol of relatedness, stilling Wordsworth’s fear at the death of histranquil relation with nature. Proteus changed shape to elude pursuers, until hewas finally wrestled to the ground. Proteus’ transformations are the flux ofWordsworth’s emotion, agitating him until he forces it into one human shape, hissister. The poet mentally grasps his externalized sister to prevent his visionof union with nature from slipping away. “Knowing that Nature never did betray”:material of overwhelming emotional importance is consigned to a participialphrase. Virginia Woolf does the same thing in To the Lighthouse, where Mrs.Ramsay’s death is casually announced in a participial phrase. Mrs. Ramsay isWoolf’s charismatic mother, whose premature death caused the novelist’s firstmental breakdown and was the determining catastrophe of her life. Theseparticiples are a ritual formalization and distancing of intolerable emotion.Wordsworth’s mother died when he was eight. He says of her in The Prelude, “Sheleft us destitute” (V.259). Mothers do betray. Nature is Wordsworth’s secondabandoning mother.So the sister-spirit abruptly appears in Tintern Abbey because Wordsworth istroubled by a new destitution, the departure of loving maternal nature. Perhapsthe anima is always externalized at moments of spiritual crisis. Addressing thenation the morning he left the White House after his resignation, Richard Nixonwas overcome by reminiscences of his mother. Tears in his eyes, he said, “Shewas a saint.” Media derision of this as Nixonian calculation surprised me:Italians do not find it ridiculous to speak of one’s mother at peak dramaticmoments. Italian soldiers lying wounded on the battlefield in the two world warscalled upon not wives or sweethearts but “Mamma, Mamma.” At his moment ofcataclysmic loss, a dissolution of the politically supreme male persona, Nixonunderwent a voyage of Proustian memory from a sordid, self-befouled present intoa mythical lost paradise of childhood. In the process, he summoned his mother,who was, I submit, powerfully evoked. She really did hover at his side as hisprojected anima, visible to the eye of imagination. Athletes whooping it up onthe sidelines after a personal triumph look into the camera and say, “Hi, Mom!”It’s rarely “Hi, Dad,” because the father figure can never serve, as do mothers,sisters, and beautiful youths, as emblem of passage from one imaginative realmto the next. Father and brother are society; mother and sister are emotion.In The Prelude Dorothy is the Muse confirming Wordsworth in his poetic vocation.She is a marriage broker or Psychopompos guiding him through the Orphicunderworld of emotion toward his “true self.” Her “sweet influence” drew himaway from the severity and “terror” of Milton’s masculine style: “Thou didstsoften down / This over-sternness.” Her femininity flowed into and tempered him(XI.333–48, XIV.237–50). Wordsworth’s spiritual identity with his sister was sointense we must classify it as Romantic incest. Some suggest the two weresexually involved, which I think unlikely. The one Romantic who may actuallyhave committed incest was Byron, and that did not last long. Wordsworth and hissister transformed incest into a spiritual principle. Here and in Shelley’sEpipsychidion, Romantic incest is a metaphor for supersaturation of identity. Itis an archaic device to propel history backwards, enabling the poet to return toprimal sources of inspiration.In his culminating reference to Dorothy in The Prelude, Wordsworth says thehighest condition of the man of imagination is “singleness” (XIV.211). A spouseis superfluous, since the superior man contains both sexes married within hisown psyche. G. Wilson Knight calls this Wordsworth’s “higher integration”: it isa “wholeness beyond normality,” “an androgynous state.”4[ch25_notes.html#ch11note4a] Bloom says of all artists, “The poet-in-a-poetcannot marry, whatever the person-in-a-poet chooses to have done.”5[ch25_notes.html#ch11note5a] In The Prelude there is a direct chain ofconnection, over seventeen lines, from Wordsworth’s “singleness” to the heart“tender as a nursing mother’s.” Wordsworth internalizes the feminine world andmakes it his bride-state. Now he thinks of the angelic messenger who impregnatedhim with her female power, Dorothy, “Sister of my soul!” (232). The sister isthe feminine half of the soul allowing the poet to remain superbly alone, amagus contemplating reality but not subordinated to it.Wordsworth’s poetry represents the three women closest to him as physicallyporous. In other words, Wordsworth’s high affect blurs female contour. The womencharacters of Wordsworth’s anecdotal story-poems are far more definitive asphysical presences. The less a woman is loved by Wordsworth, the more clearlyshe is seen. Oddly for a poet of nature, Wordsworth’s ardor dematerializes orseraphicizes the beloved. She ceases to be an object, much less a sex object.Does Wordsworth fear his own aggressive eye? Compare this generalizing style toWordsworth’s pictorial technique for his most characteristic figure, the agedmale solitary. The old Cumberland beggar, for example, eats scraps of food outof “a bag all white with flour.” Showers of crumbs fall from “his palsied hand.”His body is “bow-bent.” As he “creeps” along, the wind beats “his grey locksagainst his withered face.” The leech-gatherer of “Resolution and Independence”is a “decrepit Man,” with a body “bent double.” He seems the oldest man “thatever wore grey hairs.” He props himself, “limbs, body, and pale face,” on “along grey staff of shaven wood.” These detailed figures are vastly moreindividuated than Dorothy, Lucy, or Mary. They have the lugubrious specificityof muckraking photojournalism.Wordsworth’s male solitaries are found objects, art works made by buffetingnature. Survivors of some wreck of civilization, they are weathered likedriftwood. Their Giacometti-like thinness is a withering by pitiless experience.External forces devour the human until it is close to absorption by nature. Thesolitaries are dignified but paralyzed. They exist in a melancholy state ofcontraction from which there is no escape through action. Only passive responsesare possible: fortitude and endurance. The thinness of Wordsworth’s solitariesis another reduction of self. Wordsworth said, in the classic maxim of Romanticsolipsism, “I was often unable to think of external things as having externalexistence.” The specificity and density of the male solitaries come from thepoet’s attempt to externalize them, to pin and fix them as temporary foci ofperception. But a forbidding open space surrounds them, an agoraphobicwasteland. As in Edvard Munch’s The Scream, Wordsworth’s male figures aresimultaneously abandoned in dreadful isolation and assaulted by malicious wavesof natural force. Descartes, Bloom says, created “the dumbfoundering abyssbetween ourselves and the object.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note6a] The estrangedwestern space between persons is crossed by Wordsworth’s eye. He throws hisvision out like a harpoon drawing its line after it, a harpoon not so muchpiercing its target as casting about it an encapsulating sac of sympatheticemotion, an aura protecting it momentarily from the elements. But the forcepressing so fiercely on these old men is Wordsworth’s “love,” a love thatdesiccates their flesh and crushes them to skeletal scarcity of being. LikeBlake in “Infant Joy,” Wordsworth demonstrates the secret aggression inRousseauist sympathy.Wordsworth’s poetry makes an apparently generous extension of significance intothe most minute and commonplace details of nature, benevolent “nurse” ofhumanity. But in the poems of aged male solitaries and in such scenes of“visionary dreariness” as the one in The Prelude (XII.251–61) where a girlbearing a pitcher on her head is battered by the wind, a different emotionalphysics obtains. Instead of spiritual expansion, there are stark disproportions,terrifying vacancies, energy clusters burst and abraded—sudden sacralizationsfollowed by intolerable desolation. The solitaries express Wordsworth’s secretfear. They are what is left when mother nature is done with man, dry bones shehas picked over. Romantic consciousness is unlimited, but the image of the self,the body-image, has gotten smaller. In Wordsworth it is a tottering old man withpalsied hands. The liberated Rousseauist self fails to fill the space vacated byreligion and society. It has shrunk from its role in the great theater of theChristian cosmos. The star has become only an extra. Extra means on the veryverge of the human, nudged out of consciousness into the brute inarticulatenessof object-life. Gender disappears in Wordsworth not simply because personalityis devalued, as in Blake, but because human experience is under sentence ofextinction. Arguing that nature is benign, Wordsworth is haunted by a spectre ofisolation, his own repressed dread of mother nature’s cruelty.The aged and infirm male is Wordsworth’s most powerful self-identification.Contracted body-image is his psychomorphic topos. The solitaries are a nightmareother self, and Wordsworth’s dialogues with them are daemonic communion with adoppelgänger. On the terrace of his villa shortly before his death, Shelleyencountered his double, a phantom who demanded, “How long do you mean to becontent?” Wordsworth’s double has a contrary message. The leech-gatherer, withhis soothing sibylline smile, is an oracle telling his story, then receding likea shade in the underworld. He assures the poet that rueful contentment is stillpossible amid universal desolation. The confrontation with the infirmdoppelgänger is a script that Wordsworth writes over and over. His poetry isfilled with ritualistic returns of this cadaverous spectre, who appears indifferent places and under different names. The Wordsworthian solitary is likeDonatello’s late-phase sculptures, scored, tormented figures of Gothic leannessand angularity. In their stony decrepitude, Wordsworth’s old men are likestalagmites or dolmens, picturesque artifacts of affliction. They are highlyspecific, yet typological. Their omnipresence in Wordsworth’s poetry is part ofhis exclusion of virile males. Goethe says, “Thought expands, but lames; Actionanimates, but narrows.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note7a] Wordsworth’s contractedmale bodies have been produced by the modern fall of the western hero. TheWordsworthian solitary is sexually composite. He is a male heroine, a passivemale sufferer. For the poet, both solitary and soul-mate sister are modes of theself in half-feminine form.If his imagination seeks to pass beyond itself through mental intercourse withreality, Wordsworth can only be aroused by incarnations of nature-inspiredfemaleness. Perhaps no one spouse is sufficient. Perhaps the slow succession ofprotagonists, male and female, in Wordsworth’s story-poems are nominees,candidates who are scrutinized and rejected. Only nature, the all-mother, cansatisfy the marriage-hunger of Wordsworthian imagination. My belief thatWordsworth’s character is sexually dual contradicts Coleridge’s assertion: “Ofall men I ever knew, Wordsworth has the least femininity in his mind. He is allman. He is a man of whom it might have been said, ‘It is good for him to bealone’.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note8a] There is reason to question thissubliminally homoerotic statement, as we will see when we examine Coleridge’sanguished character. Coleridge said in conversation, “A great mind must beandrogynous,” a remark paraphrased by Virginia Woolf in A Room of One’s Own. Shegoes on to describe major male writers in sexual terms: Shakespeare was“androgynous,” Shelley “sexless”; Milton, Wordsworth, and Tolstoy had “a dashtoo much of the male,” Proust “a little too much of a woman.”9[ch25_notes.html#ch11note9a] As the years pass, this arresting passage seemsmore and more meaningless to me. One could defend each writer against Woolf’scharges, but let’s stick with Wordsworth. Throughout her work, Woolf makes theandrogyne superior to ordinary virile men, an attitude I find mean andparochial. The androgyne is a great creative symbol, but it should not usurp theauthority of all other sexual personae.That Wordsworth is too male is the reverse of the truth. Bloom says, “It is truethat Wordsworth is almost too masculine a poet.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note10a]But is there any poem or passage in Wordsworth about which we could say, this istoo masculine? The most masculine passages in Wordsworth are the most Miltonic.But these are among his greatest, for example, the ascent of Mount Snowdon.Wordsworth’s sister-spirit helped liberate him from Milton’s style, with itsponderous, declamatory Latinism and syntactic inversions, which do appear in ThePrelude. Later in his career, Bloom demonstrated how heavily Milton’s precedentfell upon “belated” English poets, who had to struggle against him. In my view,to say Wordsworth is “almost too masculine” is to say he is too much in the gripof Milton. Too-masculine Wordsworth is a slave, hopelessly swallowed up in hisgreat precursor. So paradoxically, when Wordsworth is most masculine, he ispoetically most passive! In poetic terms, much has come to us by Milton speakingthrough Wordsworth. In psychobiographical terms, Wordsworth’s efforts to find apersonal voice were sexually swamped by Milton. The sadomasochism in thisprocess will be directly felt by Wordsworth’s colleague, Coleridge.Wordsworth is never too masculine. The real danger in him is the too feminine.Wordsworth has several voices. The most male is the Miltonic sublime. The mostfemale is the languishing pathos of the story-poems, where the sufferings ofwomen, children, and animals are dwelt upon at excruciating length. Wordsworthcreated Victorian sentimentalism. Modernism’s cool revolt against Wordsworthiansentiment is typified by Oscar Wilde’s cynical resume of a teary Dickens novel:“One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell withoutlaughing.” Lewis Carroll’s wacky verses, like “The Aged Aged Man,” mockWordsworth’s solemn solitaries. That Wordsworthian pathos lends itself so easilyto parody suggests there is some real excess in it. The palsied hands of the oldCumberland beggar, the grey hairs (significant plural) “worn” by theleech-gatherer are grotesque details confining and limiting emotion instead offreeing and deepening it. Unlike melodrama, high tragedy never depends onoverdetermined externals. The leech-gatherer, with his sparse grey hairs,reminds me of Woolf’s father, Sir Leslie Stephen, who as a morose widower wasoverheard loudly moaning as he trudged up the stairs, “Why won’t my whiskersgrow? Why won’t my whiskers grow?” In the sentimental mode, too little is askedto bear too much. Wordsworth’s story-poems are self-dramatizations of excessivepathos, the ever-present trap in Wordsworth’s world. The story of Margaret, forexample, a beautiful extract from The Excursion called “The Ruined Cottage”: canempathy really be sustained in perfect integrity for as long as this woeful taledemands? In fact, is Wordsworth himself capable of so prolonged a habitation inthe sorrows of another? Such sentimental narratives are disguised dramas ofWordsworth’s feminine self. F. W. Bateson says: “Wordsworth had experienced mostof Margaret’s miseries. In a sense he was Margaret.”11[ch25_notes.html#ch11note11a] That a writer may enter his own fiction as a lessdeveloped version of himself is a principle we saw operating in Goethe’s Wertherand Wilhelm Meister.Wordsworth’s poetry is weakened when his identification with a sufferingcharacter is too extreme. Empathy degenerates into sentimentality, which Iinterpret as self-pity, since the protagonists are self-projections.Wordsworth’s best moments are when he achieves a balance between his male andfemale voices. This he does in Tintern Abbey, which has perfect pitch. It islean, supple, and majestic. There is only one misstep: at the end, Wordsworthrecalls “the sneers of selfish men.” These are obviously virile males! Thepoet’s voice turns strident. His sneering men are like a row of desperadosnoisily taking snuff. Tintern Abbey maintains emotional balance because of itsritualistic externalization of the sister-spirit. Wordsworth’s address to thenuminous Dorothy functions as a correct positioning of the female part of theself to the male, like that fine-tuning necessary for Blake’s mobile Emanations.Wordsworth turns to his sister and rejoices in her companionship. He sees her asseparate, even as he simultaneously acknowledges her as his mirror-image. Hisfemale self-identification is purified and strengthened by consciousness. It iscandid, not covert. It is in the covert self-identifications that Wordsworthfalls into sentimental excess.Coleridge thought Wordsworth’s unknown Lucy was Dorothy—whom De Quinceydescribed as having an “unsexual” stride. Commenting on “the curioussexlessness” of the Lucy poems, Bateson theorizes that Wordsworth’s crisis of1798 was the increasing threat of incest with Dorothy: Lucy’s premature death isWordsworth’s subconscious termination of his “horrible” attraction to Dorothy“by killing her off symbolically.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note12a] But noRomantic poet except Blake resists incestuous fantasies. Far from strugglingagainst incest, Wordsworth elegantly assimilates it into his imaginative life.Lucy’s death is like the deaths of Dido, Madame Bovary, and Anna Karenina, theritualistic slaying of an unmanageably feminine element in a male artist. Lucyand Dorothy are the female half of the soul. But Lucy is Dorothy escapingcontrol by the male half. This is why Lucy is represented as lost, at adistance, elusive. Wordsworth searches for her, but it is important he not findher. She is the Blakean Emanation who flees in order to dominate. What issymbolically killed off is not incest but sentimentality, the greatesttemptation and danger to Wordsworth’s poetry. Wordsworth’s pathetic story-poemsare languid Spenserian bowers where the female half of the soul lures the malehalf into drowsy ecstasies of passive surrender. Michelangelo, a far moremasculine man than Wordsworth, was fascinated by similar dreams of voluptuouspassivity.“What is a Poet?” Wordsworth asks in the preface to Lyrical Ballads. “He is aman speaking to men.” But how does a man speak when finally free of traditionand form? Wordsworth is bedeviled by male and female impulses, which hestruggles to harmonize in a single style. Hartman says the “I” of Wordsworth’sPrelude does not indicate “a persona-consciousness”: “An inner confidence allowshim to meet nature, or his own emotions, without a persona.”13[ch25_notes.html#ch11note13a] But Wordsworth’s persona is one of the strongest,fiercest, and falsest in all poetry. As the intensely persona-conscious Wildesaid, “To be natural is such a very difficult pose to keep up.” There can be nospeech, no man speaking to men without persona. Words are contaminated withpersonality. Even in journalism, history, or science, there are no words withoutpoint of view. Wordsworth is under tremendous self-imposed pressure to find apersona, for that is the voice he needs to justify the ways of nature to men. “Ido,” Wordsworth says to the nature-mother, but he cannot allow himself to seeher clearly. Censoring out the negativity and savagery in nature, he puts hisown voice in a bind. Wordsworth is the first humorless liberal. Even Rousseau ismore self-analytical and aware of his quirky perversities. Sade, laughing, seescomedy in cruelty and knows there is cruelty in all comedy. Eighteenth-centurywit, imitated by Wilde, was the most aggressive of rhetorical forms. Renouncingwit and repressing nature’s sadism, Wordsworth made bathos his slough ofdespond. The chthonian miasma made a new swamp for her blind son to fall into.Shelley may have been the first to charge Wordsworth with inhibited sexuality.In his satire, “Peter Bell the Third,” Shelley calls Wordsworth a “moraleunuch,” “a male prude,” “a solemn and unsexual man,” “a male Molly.” Knightsays, “The Prelude is peculiarly non-sexual. The silence in so general astatement is remarkable.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note14a] Trilling declares,“There can be no doubt about it, Wordsworth, at the extreme or perversion ofhimself, carries the element of quietude to the point of the denial ofsexuality.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note15a] Hartman protests this criticalcurrent and insists the great themes of Wordsworth’s poetry must not be“profaned by such partial analysis.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch11note16a] What ispartial and reductive in most Freudian interpretations of art is that they focuson sex without realizing that sex is a subset of nature. Joining Frazer toFreud, as I try to do, solves this problem. Everything sexual or unsexual in artcarries world-view and nature theory with it. The sex in Wordsworth is in theeroticized female emotions, which wrap Wordsworth in a numinous cloud wheneverhe descends from the masculine Miltonic sublime. Wordsworth hopes for happinessthrough pure feeling, but the happiest things in his poetry are daffodils. Hisdevotions to mother nature simply produce frightful hallucinations of parched,mute spectres, his starved self. Wordsworth cannot admit that the hand that willnot feed is closed in a fist. Words worth’s sexlessness is his capitulation tomother nature. She lives for him. The prison of society or the prison of nature:leaving one, Wordsworth enters the other. Hence the strange stillness of hispoetry, the quietude that is really immobility. Energy, sought by Blake, isshunned by Wordsworth. Through energy to sex to cruelty: Wordsworth, pursuingRousseau’s mother nature, embraces a deceiving ghost."},{"pageContent":"12THE DAEMON AS LESBIAN VAMPIREColeridgeColeridge, unlike Wordsworth, finds nature. Or rather, she finds him. Wordworthspent a lifetime editing out of his poetry the brute reality that Coleridgefrankly faces: the daemonism of nature. In Christabel, inspired by the rapecycle of. The Faerie Queene, Coleridge destroys Wordworth’s Rousseauist world offeminine tenderness. Christabel is one of the most misread poems in literature.Critics have projected a Christian moralism upon it. Coleridge himself could notbear what he had written, and he tried to revise and reinterpret long afterward.Christabel is a splendid case study of the tension between imagination andmorality. Through it, we follow a great poet into his excess of daemonic visionand then out again into the social realm of humane good wishes, where thevisionary is beset by doubt, anxiety, and guilt. Christabel shows the birth ofpoetry in evil, hostility, and crime.To arrive at Christabel, we must tour Coleridge’s other major poems todemonstrate their eccentric sexual character. His favorite proverb was “Extremesmeet.” He calls imagination “that synthetic and magical power,” producing “thebalance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.”1[ch25_notes.html#ch12note1a] In Christabel, opposites come together sopowerfully that Coleridge could not shape the poem according to his statedintention. It is no coincidence that his supreme works are dream poems. Freudsays dreams disregard “the category of contraries and contradictions”: “‘No’seems not to exist so far as dreams are concerned.”2[ch25_notes.html#ch12note2a] No, says the Decalogue, thoushalt not. Much ofColeridge’s conscious life was devoted to defenses of Christianity. In thepoetry welling up from his dream life, however, the Judeo-Christian no isobliterated by sexually dual daemonic powers. “Grant me a nature having twocontrary forces,” he once wrote. M. H. Abrams sees influence here from theCabalists, Bruno, Boehme, and Swedenborg.3 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note3a] Thesynthesis of contraries comes to Coleridge from outside orthodox Christianity.He is drawing on the underground current in western culture, that promiscuouspagan mixture of Hermeticism, alchemy, and astrology. His essay on alchemists(1818) is less crucial than the dream poems themselves, morally unstableconcoctions boiling over with daemonic energy.Coleridge’s “primary Imagination” is “the infinite I AM.”4[ch25_notes.html#ch12note4a] The self-divinizing Romantic poet displacesJehovah. His “I AM” is cosmos-devouring. It confers upon the artist thatinalienable right to self-assertion we see in the Decadent Late Romantic cult ofself. In Wilde, for example, Coleridge’s theory turns into the ideal ofpersonality as a work of art and of the life as superior to the work. Wildesays, “The true artist is a man who believes absolutely in himself, because heis absolutely himself.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note5a] Poetic identity asinfinite ego: we will see this at work at the opening of Christabel, whereGeraldine wills herself into existence out of the darkness.Coleridge contrasts true imagination with uninspired “Fancy,” merely “a mode ofMemory” playing with “fixities and definites.” If we extend this distinctionpsychologically, fancy’s fixities become rigid sex roles inherited from thepast. Coleridge says of “secondary Imagination,” “It dissolves, diffuses,dissipates, in order to re-create.” His dream poems are metamorphoses of psychewhere primary imagination uses secondary imagination to dissolve sexualpersonae. The poems are an alchemic bath of swirling Dionysian liquidity. Fromthe dissolution of morality and history comes daemonic re-creation, a syntheticHomunculus. Over all Coleridge’s great poems hovers a strange androgyne, afabricated superself.Coleridge’s sexual ambiguities are already evident in “The Eolian Harp” (1795),a far stranger poem than scholars admit. It is nearly schizophrenic in itsargument with itself. Sara, the wife named again and again, is merely a symbolof the social and moral, with which Coleridge never managed to achieve correctrelation. Husband, citizen, pious Christian: these were chimeras that tauntedthe poet; these were personae that he strove toward and never won. Criticismsees “The Eolian Harp” as a hymn to marital bliss. But what the poem shows is asexual turbulence that will erupt two years later in the mystery poems.The wind-harp of the title begins a High Romantic tradition, reaching its peakin Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind.” It is a vehicle of sexualself-transformation. The poet is a passive instrument played upon by themasculine Muse-force of nature. Coleridge openly eroticizes the metaphor fromthe start: the harp is “by the desultory breeze caress’d, / Like some coy maidhalf yielding to her lover.” Scholars, sexually normalizing the poem, identifySara with the coy maid. But Sara is imaginatively peripheral. Coleridgeaddresses her only to remind himself who or what he should be. Every allusion toSara is tense and frenetic.Romantic poems are radically solipsistic. Coleridge, not Sara, is the coy maid.His ecstatic self-projections are always feminine: “Full many a thought uncall’dand undetain’d, / And many idle flitting phantasies, / Traverse my indolent andpassive brain.” For Coleridge, like Wordsworth and Keats, indolence is creative,a drowsy dream state into which the unconscious releases images uncensored byintellect. The indolent male has a female receptivity. This passage, deceptivelypleasant and airy, becomes cruelly darker when read in the light of the latermystery poems. By the time we get to Christabel, “idle flitting phantasies” willnot just traverse but rape the poet’s brain. Femininity is dangerous. Whatenables the poet to speak here will stop all speech later.In “The Eolian Harp,” Coleridge swerves back and forth between his sense ofsocial and religious duty and his longing for erotic and creative passivity. Toget these things together at one moment would seem impossible. Yet that is whathappens the night Coleridge listens to Wordsworth recite The Prelude, which hecelebrates in a peculiar poem, “To William Wordsworth” (1807). Here it is clearthat, for Coleridge, spiritual exaltation means sexual self-immolation. Roll,Jordan, roll: Wordsworth’s voice sweeps over Coleridge in wave after wave ofbardic power: “In silence listening, like a devout child, / My soul lay passive,by thy various strain / Driven as in surges now beneath the stars.” He feelslike “a tranquil sea, / Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon.”Coleridge is a wind-harp vibrating to someone else’s music. Wordsworth speaksfor nature and crushes Coleridge by the enormity of his achievement. There is nodialogue, only monologue, an intercourse of brute assertion and thrillingreceptivity. The scene is distinctly erotic. The swelling sea-soul echoesWordsworth’s sonnet of the prior year, “The World Is Too Much With Us,” wherethe sea “bares her bosom to the moon.” Wordsworth and Coleridge were locked in asadomasochistic marriage of minds, where Wordsworth kept the hierarchicaladvantage and Coleridge surrendered himself to ritualistic self-abasement.Coleridge, we saw, curiously said of Wordsworth, “He is all man.” Not only isthis not true of Wordsworth, but it rings with homoerotic infatuation. Tortured,inconstant Coleridge saw in Wordsworth’s cold composure a kind of masculineresoluteness. Wordsworth needed Coleridge as much as Coleridge neededWordsworth. I argued that when Wordsworth’s voice is at its most masculine(significantly, in The Prelude,) it is in poetic terms at its most passivebecause most Miltonic. The night reading of The Prelude is a spectacle ofshamanistic black magic. Wordsworth, dominated by Milton, dominates Coleridge.Poetic identity, gelling and melting, streams down a cascade of hierarchicallevels, a sexual feudalism of master-slave relationships. Let us recall it isColeridge whom The Prelude most continually addresses. Coleridge’ssubmissiveness allows Wordsworth to emerge intact from his flooding by Milton inthat poem. Coleridge, listening to it, is Danae impregnated by Zeus’s goldenshower. Coleridge puns on the idea of spiritual insemination in the second line,where he says of The Prelude, “Into my heart have I received that Lay.” He ispenetrated and filled by Wordsworth, to whom he abandons himself. Sex is poetry;poetry is sex.Coleridge did his best work under Wordsworth’s influence. After they separated,Coleridge languished poetically and never matched his early achievements. Thenature of their collaboration was this: Wordsworth was a father/lover whoabsorbed Coleridge’s self-punishing superego and allowed his turbulent dreamlife to spill directly into his poetry. The supreme irony, as we shall see, isthat everything that is great in Coleridge is a negation of Wordsworth. This isthe son’s ultimate revenge upon the father. Wordsworth’s leading moral idea ofnature’s benevolence is annihilated in Coleridge. Coleridge sees the chthonianhorror in nature that Wordsworth could not acknowledge. The vampires ofChristabel and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner are the true nature-mother.Wordsworth reawakened sleeping pagan nature-cult, then flew from the spectres hehad roused. How easily Wordsworth was assimilated into bourgeoisnineteenth-century culture. His Protestant moralism was his barrier against thedaemonic. It is pagan Coleridge, not Protestant Wordsworth, who is the begetterof nineteenth-century archetypal vision. The Decadent Late Romantic line of Poe,Baudelaire, Moreau, Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Swinburne, Pater, Huysmans,Beardsley, and Wilde descends directly from Coleridge’s mystery poems. By hispregnant servitude to Wordsworth, Coleridge bore monstrous children who woulddestroy their father.Tutelary relationships are filled with sexual ambiguities. Coleridge callsWordsworth “O Friend! my comforter and guide! / Strong in thyself, and powerfulto give strength!” But perhaps the teacher is never strong except in teaching.Perhaps teaching is a kind of vampirism in which mesmerizing assertions ofauthority drink the energy they arouse. I find two parallels to the alliancebetween Wordsworth and Coleridge. In Jane Austen, Emma’s intimacy with thedocile Harriet, upon whom she imposes calamitous pretensions, arises from herown narcissistic oscillations of sexual identity. In Virginia Woolf, ugly,clumsy Doris Kilman binds the beautiful young Elizabeth Dalloway to her by adomineering authority hiding doubt and self-contempt. In all three cases,teaching is an erotic transaction. A submissive companion becomes the audiencetoward whom a hierarchic persona is theatrically projected.Performance and audience are multiply present at the end of “To WilliamWordsworth.” “Round us both / That happy vision of belovéd faces”: this ring ofeyes is one of Coleridge’s persistent motifs. Wordsworth as “comforter andguide” is Beatrice and Vergil combined; the faces of family and friends arecelestial circles of the mystic rose. Rising, in the final line, to find himself“in prayer,” Coleridge appeals not to God but to Wordsworth. And what he praysfor is more poetry—his own. The universe has become a theater of sex and poetry.Wordsworth, performing, is watched by Coleridge. But Coleridge, seduced andinseminated by Wordsworth, is watched by the ring of eyes. The poem dissolvesinto a magic circle that is primal scene and family romance. In similar passagesin Whitman and Swinburne, the erotic ecstasy of a masochistic male heroine isstrongly stimulated by a ring of attentive eyes. “To William Wordsworth” is aluridly pagan poem. Incantation by a god-priest in a cult of personality leadsto ritual public intercourse. Climax is epiphany and transfiguration. Sexualexhibitionism and voyeurism are at the heart of art. Here as in Christabel, thehunger for conversion is expressed as a hunger for rape.Literature’s most influential male heroine is the protagonist of The Rime of theAncient Mariner. Wordsworth was the first to notice the Mariner’s passivesuffering. In the 1800 edition of Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth lists the “greatdefects” of the poem: “first, that the principal person has no distinctcharacter … secondly, that he does not act, but is continually acted upon.”Bloom speaks of the Mariner’s “extraordinary passivity.” Graham Hough equatesthe ship’s motionlessness with “complete paralysis of the will.” George Whalleygoes further: “The Mariner’s passivity is Coleridge’s too.”6[ch25_notes.html#ch12note6a] My reading of The Ancient Mariner makes thispassivity the central psychological fact of the poem. I reject moralinterpretations, typified by Robert Penn Warren’s canonical essay. Edward E.Bostetter argues against Warren point by point: “The poem is the morbidlyself-obsessed account of a man who through his act has become the center ofuniversal attention.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note7a] Two hundred sailors, dying,stare dolefully at the Mariner. The male heroine, by operaticself-dramatization, is a prima donna triumphing through exquisite publicsuffering. The eyes of the universe are fixed on him. Coleridge’s ring of eyesis part paranoiac reproach, part eroticizing adoration. Eyes crucify hisprotagonists, pinning them in immobilized passivity, an uncanny world fear.Sagas of the male heroine are always artistically endangered by the serpentinedynamic of self-identification. The Mariner, with his “long grey beard” and“skinny hand,” recalls those Wordsworthian solitaries of “grey hairs” and“palsied hand” in whom I see a self-identification by the poet so extreme as todebilitate the text by sentimentality. Parts of The Ancient Mariner areill-written to the point of Lewis Carroll parody: “‘Hold off! unhand me,grey-beard loon!’ / Eftsoons his hand dropt he.” “The Wedding-Guest here beathis breast, / For he heard the loud bassoon.” “Four times fifty living men …With heavy thump, a lifeless lump, / They dropped down one by one.” Rhyme ismerely ritualistic chiming, the darkening cloud of fate. Stanzas fall intoslapstick and heedlessly sail on. The Ancient Manner is one of the greatestpoems in English, yet what it achieves is almost in defiance of language. Visionand execution often wildly diverge. Coleridge’s sober “conversation poems” arein better taste; but they are minor works in literary history, belonging to theage of sensibility, and would never have made the poet’s fame. The samedisjunction of form and content afflicts Poe, Coleridge’s heir. The Frenchaccused America of slighting her greatest poet in Poe, who may sound better inBaudelaire’s translation than in English. Poe, like Coleridge, is a giant ofimagination, and imagination has its own laws. In Poe’s tales and Coleridge’smystery poems, the daemonic expresses itself nakedly. Dionysus always shakes offrules of Apollonian form.Coleridge and Poe are seized by visions that transcend language, that belong tothe dream experience beyond language. Psychoanalysis, I said, overestimates thelinguistic character of the unconscious. Dreaming is a pagan cinema. The wit ofdreams comes from treating words as if they were objects. Coleridge and Poe havewritten works of cinema. Had film been available as a medium, perhaps that isthe form they would have chosen, for language here is only an obstruction tovision. Evaluating the language of The Ancient Mariner by Renaissance orAugustan standards would be depressing. There are a few great lines in it; forexample, “And ice, mast-high, came floating by, / As green as emerald.” Imaintain that all such wonderful moments in The Ancient Mariner look forward toChristabel, that Christabel, with its cold green snake, is struggling to be bornthroughout this poem. The rhetorical weaknesses in Coleridge and Poe have beenproduced by a warp of self-identification. Vision drives with such force fromthe unconscious that the craftsmanlike shape-making of consciousness lagsbehind.The Ancient Mariner, a rhapsody of the male heroine, is filled with piercingarias: “Alone, alone, all, all alone, / Alone on a wide wide sea! / And never asaint took pity on / My soul in agony.” Emotional expressionism of this kind ispossible in Italian but not in English. At his maudlin fall, Shakespeare’sRichard II cries, “My large kingdom for a little grave, / A little, littlegrave, an obscure grave” (III.iii.152–53). Intensified littleness gives you acartoon pinpoint of dancing dwarves. Coleridge’s intoning “alones” overpopulatethemselves, baying like a canine chorus. Sheer velocity of identification makeshim miss the infelicity of rhyming “thump” with “lump.” There is too muchagrarian comedy latent in our Anglo-Saxon monosyllables. The principle at workin The Ancient Mariner, as in “To William Wordsworth,” is pagan sexualexhibitionism. Self-pity in The Ancient Mariner is like the self-flagellation ofthe ancient goddess-cults. It is neither callow nor sick. It is a ritual deviceto facilitate daemonic vision. The Romantic male heroine is a self-emasculatingdevotee of chthonian nature.Personae in The Ancient Mariner form a sexual allegory. The poem begins with theMariner stopping the Wedding-Guest as he enters a marriage banquet. The scene’sdeep structure is exactly the same as at the opening of Christabel: a strangerwith a “glittering eye” puts a spell on an innocent, who falls under daemoniccompulsion. The Mariner detains the guest with his tale of woe, which takes upthe whole poem. At the end, the guest gloomily turns away from the Bridegroom’sdoor and departs. The merry feast goes on without him. My theory is this:Bridegroom, Wedding-Guest, and Mariner are all aspects of Coleridge. TheBridegroom is a masculine persona, the self comfortably integrated in society.This virile alter ego is always perceived longingly and at a distance, throughan open door through which come bursts of happy laughter. The Wedding-Guest,“next of kin” to the Bridegroom, is an adolescent supplicant aspiring to sexualfulfillment and collective joy. To achieve this, the Wedding-Guest must mergewith the Bridegroom. But he is always prevented from doing so by the appearanceof a spectre self, the Mariner, the male heroine or hermaphroditic self wholuxuriates in passive suffering. It’s a case of always the bridesmaid and neverthe bride. The Wedding-Guest turns away at the end because once more thehieratically wounded self has won. The Guest will never be the Bridegroom. Asmany times as he attempts to pass through the door to the place of festivity,the Mariner will materialize and paralyze him with his seductive tale. Thisdoorway is the obsessive scene of the Coleridgean sexual crux. Ostracism andcasting out are the Romantic road to identity. Will that doorway ever bebreached? Yes, in Christabel. And only by the most bizarre strategy ofperversity and transsexualism.The apparently pivotal event in the Mariner’s tale is the killing of thealbatross, from which follow all his sufferings. From the moment I read the poemin high school, I thought the albatross a superficial appendage, a kind of pinthe tail on the donkey, and I found the stress on it by teachers and criticsunconvincing and moralistic. Long afterward, I learned it was Wordsworth whosuggested the idea of the albatross to Coleridge, which proves my point. Thisalbatross is the biggest red herring in poetry. Its only significance is as avehicle of transgression. The Mariner commits an obscure crime and becomes thefocus of cosmic wrath. But he is as blameless as the shadow heroes of Kafka, whoare hauled before faceless courts of law. In the world of The Ancient Mariner,any action is immediately punished. Masculine assertion is rebuked and humanitycondemned to passive suffering.Blake’s “Crystal Cabinet” contains the same dramatic crisis: the moment the maleacts, he is expelled into the wilderness. Blake’s male is changed to a weepingbabe in infantile dependency on a weeping woman. Coleridge’s Mariner is alsopropelled backward to a maternal world. The ship is becalmed: “The very deep didrot: O Christ! / That ever this should be! / Yea, slimy things did crawl withlegs / Upon the slimy sea.” Stasis, slime. This is a vision of primalnondifferentiation, the chthonian swamp of generation. The universe has returnedto one big womb, claustrophobic, airless, teeming with monstrous prehuman mudcreatures. The Mariner’s appeal to Christ is the opposite of what it seems. Itshows that Coleridge, despite his conscious assent to Christianity, understandswith the intuition of a great poet that the swamp-world of the Great Motherprecedes the world of Christ and is ready at any moment to engulf it. Tworemarks prove that Coleridge literally visualized a chthonian swamp: he oncespoke of the “Sands and Swamps of Evil” and elsewhere of lust as “the reek ofthe Marsh.”The Ancient Mariner is one of Romantic poetry’s great regressions to thedaemonic and primeval. Every man makes a marine voyage out of the cell ofarchaic ocean that is the sac of womb-waters. We all emerge covered with slimeand gasping for life. “The many men, so beautiful! / And they all dead did lie:/ And a thousand thousand slimy things / Lived on; and so did I.” All hopes forbeauty and manhood lie dead. Male power can never surpass female power. We livein the slime of our bodies, which hold imagination hostage. Our mother-bornbodies are unregenerate nature, beyond God’s redemption. The “slimy sea” ofchthonian nature nullifies the words of Christ. Coleridge is overwhelmed by apagan vision coming to him from below and beyond his own ethics. The AncientMariner transports its Gothic tale out of the historical world of castles andabbeys into the sublime theater of a desolate nature. But expansion of space isjust another cul-de-sac. Coleridge brilliantly converts the open sea into arotting sepulchre, which I called the daemonic womb of Gothic. This is one blackhole from which Christ will never rise. The Ancient Mariner is the source ofPoe’s The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, with its disastrous voyage in awomb-tomb ship. Evolution and motion are an illusion in the dank prison space ofchthonian nature. Hence the, male heroine’s crushing passivity. Mankind staggersunder the burden of mother nature.Language, I said, is mutilated for vision in The Ancient Mariner. Thus theappeal to good has a backlash effect, sparking the birth of evil. Invocation ofChrist’s name fails to release the Mariner from his imprisonment in ocean’snightmare womb. When a sail appears on the horizon, there is a moment of hopeand joy. The Mariner attempts a new prayer: “Heaven’s Mother send us grace!” Butsacred language is profaned by daemonic revelation. On the ship is the grossestfemale apparition:Her lips were red, her looks were free,Her locks were yellow as gold:Her skin was as white as leprosy,The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,Who thicks man’s blood with cold.Appeals to sky-cult are useless. As if irritated by references to her benignsuccessor, the tender Madonna, the ur-mother makes her sensational appearance.She is the Whore of Babylon, the daemon unbound. Her lips are red withprovocation and the blood of her victims. She is all health and all disease. Sheis a masque of the red death, a Medusa who turns men to stone but also themother who stirs the blood pudding of her sons till their bodies congeal in herwomb. To give life is to kill. This is heaven’s mother, who comes when called.She is the vampire who haunts men’s dreams. Aubrey Beardsley depicts aColeridgean epiphany of the vampire Madonna in The Ascension of St. Rose ofLima. Mary, lasciviously embracing St. Rose, hovers in the air like a poisonblack cloud. Another monstrous epiphany occurs in Ingmar Bergman’s Through aGlass Darkly (1961), where a mad girl sees God as a sexually aggressive spider.The Ancient Mariner surges forward on its wave of daemonic vision from Parts Ithrough IV, but then something happens. Parts V through VII are a muddle. Thepoem recovers only when the Mariner’s tale ceases and the narrative frameresumes, where the Mariner delays the Wedding-Guest at the Bridegroom’s door.The Ancient Mariner drags on pointlessly for too long, and I think I know whereand why it goes wrong. As Part IV ends, the Mariner sees water-snakes in thesea: “Blue, glossy green, and velvet black, / They coiled and swam; and everytrack / Was a flash of golden fire.” This is one of the great moments inRomantic poetry. We are back at the dawn of time. Firmament has not yetseparated from the waters. The sun is only a yolky yellow in the albuminousjelly of the mother-stuff. Primeval ocean swarms with slimy life. But the wateris also man’s body shot with veins. These serpents, writhing with Vergilianopalescence, are the chains that bind us, our physical life. Man is a Laocoönbedeviled by serpents. We all struggle in the toils of our mother-born body. Whyare the sea-snakes veins? Because, as I said, all great lines in The AncientMariner look forward to Christabel, where the vampire has exquisite “blueveinedfeet.” Geraldine, the green snake who strangles the dove, is the daemon ofchthonian nature, trampling man in her triumph of the will.Coleridge has penetrated far into the daemonic realm. Too far, for there is animmediate retreat into conventional emotion. Vision fails, and the poem beginsto drift. Why? What have the sea-snakes roused that Coleridge cannot face? TheMariner’s response to them is embarrassingly simplistic. “A spring of love”gushes from his heart, and he blesses them. The moment he can pray, thealbatross falls from his neck and into the sea. How dreadful to see ourshaman-poet unmasked, cranking the bellows of afflatus like a stagehand.Coleridge is overcome by anxiety and surrenders to Wordsworth and toChristianity. Love and prayer are a ludicrously inadequate response to thechthonian horror that Coleridge has summoned from the dark heart of existence.The roiling sea-snakes are the barbaric energy of matter, the undulating spiralof birth and death. What is the proper response to this ecstatic hallucination?Coleridge is hemmed in. His protagonist, the Mariner, is insufficiently advancedas a sexual persona. The male heroine will need to be revised if daemonic visionis to be sustained. Christabel is a rewriting of The Ancient Mariner in new andmore daring terms. There, as we shall see, when the protagonist meets theserpent face of nature, there will be no swerving away. The poet, disguised sothat Wordsworth can no longer find him, will hurl himself into the chthonianabyss.The problem with moral or Christian readings of The Ancient Manner is that theycan make no sense of the compulsive or delusional frame of the poem. If the“spring of love” felt by the Mariner were imaginatively efficacious, the poemshould be able to conclude. Or at the very least, it should permit the Marinerto be redeemed. But the falling off of the albatross is followed by three moreparts. And even at the end of the poem, the Mariner is still forced to wanderthe world, repeating his “ghastly tale” again and again. Having introduced abenevolent emotion into his daemonic poem, Coleridge is at a loss how toproceed. A new cast of characters is hustled in—seraphs, a Pilot, a Hermit.There is confused dialogue, a fuzzy twisting and turning. Here is the point: themoment the Mariner prays, the moment good rather than evil triumphs, the poemfalls apart. At the end of Part IV, Coleridge is overwhelmed with fear at whathe has written and vainly attempts to turn his poem in a redemptive direction.The superego acts to obscure what has come from the amoral id. Nineteen yearslater, Coleridge added the marginal glosses still adorning the poem. Thesedithery festoons are afterthoughts, revisions that often depart crucially intone from the text they “explain.” We hear in them the Christian Coleridgetrying to soften the daemonic Coleridge, exactly as the older, UrizenicWordsworth “corrected” his early nature poetry. By rationalization andmoralization, Coleridge strove to put out the daemonic fires of his ownimagination.The poetic discordancies are blatant in the conclusion. The Mariner says, “OWedding-Guest! this soul hath been / Alone on a wide wide sea: / So lonely’twas, that God himself / Scarce seemed there to be.” This is the truth. In thecosmos of The Ancient Mariner, Jehovah has been obliterated by the vampiremother who rises from the slime of nature. But the Christian Coleridge keepsstitching the veil he has rent. The Mariner illogically goes on to celebratecommunal churchgoing under the kind gaze of the “great Father” and ends hismessage: “He prayeth best, who loveth best / All things both great and small; /For the dear God who loveth us, / He made and loveth all.” What a frail twig tocling to in the maelstrom of chthonian nature. This is like Blake’s ironic moraltags, evasive distortions of the severity of experience depicted in his poems:“So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm”; “Then cherish pity, lest youdrive an angel from your door.” The Mariner’s farewell stanzas are a poetic nonsequitur. They contradict everything that is great in the poem. Coleridgehimself seems to have sensed this, for long afterward he remarked that TheAncient Mariner had “too much” of a moral in it: “The only or chief fault, if Imight say so, was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the reader.”Imagination has the last word anyhow in The Ancient Mariner. Here are theclosing lines, as the Wedding-Guest turns away from the Bridegroom’s door: “Hewent like one that hath been stunned, / And is of sense forlorn: / A sadder anda wiser man, / He rose the morrow morn.” If one accepts the Christianinterpretation of the poem, how explain this peculiar reaction? TheWedding-Guest is not morally strengthened by the Mariner’s exhortations. He isplunged into gloom and severed from society. The Mariner counsels Christianlove, but the Wedding-Guest walks away as if the Mariner has said, “There is noGod, and nature is a hell of appetite and force.” But this is the secret messagethat the Wedding-Guest has divined, the message that has slipped past Coleridgedespite his vigorous efforts to steer the poem in a morally acceptabledirection. The guest arises the next day “a sadder and a wiser man,” becausethrough the smokescreen of the Christian finale has come the terrible revelationof Coleridge’s daemonic dream vision.Now to consider “Kubla Khan” in terms of sexual personae. The poem’s poet-herois both omnipotent emperor and mad prophet and outcast. He dwells in magiccircles—domes and ritual precincts, the sacred spaces of art. His power comesfrom below, the hell of chthonian nature that erupts in The Ancient Mariner.From earth’s still womblike caverns come phallic geysers of force, tossingboulders like hail. Nature pants in sexualized spasms of creation. The poet fromhis light-flooded dome of imagination surveys nature’s savage enormity, prehumanand premoral. He cannot control it, but he is its voice. Art synthesizes glassyApollonian form with coarse Dionysian flux. The dome is state and skull, ridingthe serpent desires of bowels and belly.Coleridge’s protagonists are always sexually dual. Contraries meet in the poetof “Kubla Khan”:And all should cry, Beware! Beware!His flashing eyes, his floating hair!Weave a circle round him thrice,And close your eyes with holy dread,For he on honey-dew hath fed,And drunk the milk of Paradise.The Mariner has become a mental traveller. He is a prisoner of perception.Voluptuary and ascetic, he feasts by fasting. The food of the gods makes himless and more than a man. Bloom says he is “the youth as virile poet.”8[ch25_notes.html#ch12note8a] But there is no virility here. He is an androgynetied to the stake. Celibate and solitary, he is the Wedding-Guest who cannot beBridegroom. A thousand doors are closed to him. He is the gift-bringer asbeggar, the alien who can never cross the threshold.The poet is a beautiful youth in the Hellenistic style, an ephebic kouros offemale emotionalism. His flashing eyes and floating hair combine masculine powerwith feminine beauty. Flashing eyes may command and pierce, but they can also beinviting without ambivalence, as in vivacious maidens whose eyes dance withlight. A poet’s eye flashes in this second sense; it is like a movie screenflickering with spectral images. The poet is feminine because passive to his ownvision. He is arresting because arrested. His senses are a house of detention.His eyes are the barred window of poetry.Floating hair normally belongs to the female canon of beauty. One thinks ofBotticelli’s Venus, Rita Hayworth, Hedy Lamarr. But during the late 1790s, when“Kubla Khan” was written, long unpowdered hair symbolized youth, vitality, andnonconformity. Coleridge’s flashing eyes and floating hair appear in portraitsof Napoleon, like Gros’s Bonaparte at Arcóle or David’s Napoleon Crossing theAlps, where the hero’s long hair flares in the wind of destiny. In “Kubla Khan,”the poet’s hair lifts by lyric afflatus; he is an Aeolian lyre played by thewind. I said the hyacinthine hair of the beautiful boy erotically entangles theobserver’s eye. Even in Napoleon’s streaming hair there is somethingcross-sexual. It was the feminine element in Napoleon’s charisma, a principle Ithink always sexually dual. Napoleon wore long hair only while he was young andlean, an aspiring outsider. His cropped Caesar-style hair belongs mainly to theimperial period, when he tended toward corpulence. What was earlier expressed byhis hair now resided in the female fleshiness we see in David’s Napoleon in HisStudy, where the emperor, burning the midnight oil, caresses his own belly.The poet of “Kubla Khan” is also a gaunt outsider of cometlike charisma. Hisfloating hair is his hermaphrodite banner, taunting and narcissistic. Long hairis the badge of many warrior cultures, Spartan to Sikh. But in the main line ofwestern sexual personae, long hair has been and will remain the language offeminine eros. A long-haired male is, consciously or unconsciously, callingattention to something feminine in him. He makes himself a sex object passive tothe probing eye. This was clearly the case with the seventeenth-centuryCavaliers, whose portraits have a stunning epicene glamour. The west haspersistently and probably correctly associated long male hair with a dangerousbecause entrancing and self-entranced egotism. We see this as early as theBiblical tale of Absalom, with his Alcibiades-like career of beauty andsedition. The long, unkempt hair of Coleridge’s poet is sexually, socially, andmorally defiant. It is natural because informal, but it is perverse becauseself-divinizing and autoerotic.Dangerous: the poet of “Kubla Khan” is enclosed in a zone of “holy dread.” He isan untouchable, a carrier of charisma kept under quarantine. He has an eeriesexual iridescence. Masculine and feminine dilate about him like a solar corona.People cry, “Beware! Beware!” But not because he is virile. He is not a man whoacts but a man who sees. He can induce hallucinations in others as well ashimself. “Kubla Khan” follows archaic ritual rules. Frazer says, “Holiness,magical virtue, taboo, or whatever we may call that mysterious quality which issupposed to pervade sacred or tabooed persons, is conceived by the primitivephilosopher as a physical substance or fluid, with which the sacred man ischarged just as a Leyden jar is charged with electricity.” Elsewhere he says,“The primitive mind seems to conceive of holiness as a sort of dangerous virus,which a prudent man will shun as far as possible, and of which, if he shouldchance to be infected by it, he will carefully disinfect himself by some sort ofceremonial purification.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note9a] A Maypole circle iswoven around Coleridge’s poet to contain his excess of mana. Magic againstmagic: society uses all its defenses against the dangerous radiance of art.“Kubla Khan” ends in double ceremonies, as the poet soars into trance and associety salts the ground he stands on. This is scorched earth, a temenos wherenothing will grow again. The poet is gifted but cursed, condemned to socialexclusion. Coleridge chillingly closes the eyes of humanity to his poet—that is,to himself. It is a real-life game of blindman’s bluff. At this mystic moment,all eyes are sealed. Artist and audience are at war. The poet is a nonperson,subject to mass shunning. He suffers “the Silence,” the ostracism imposed bymilitary cadets on one who has broken the honor code. We must remember this forChristabel, where the heroine is cruelly shunned after her election by thedaemonic and where she is imprisoned in her own silence. The poet is a visionarywho sees too much and is tortured by his visions. He is a scapegoat fed ondelicacies, like Aztec victims before their slaughter or like Roman volunteersin army camps who enjoyed every sensual indulgence before being rituallyexecuted. The poet is blind, maimed, lame. His imagination is free, but his bodyis bound in ritual limitation. He is a daemonic Apollo, an oracle maddened byintoxicants, here sap and milk, fluids of Dionysus. As a sexual persona,Coleridge’s poet is a suffering hermaphrodite, a sacred monster, breeding geniesfrom the sterile air.Christabel is the destination to which the Coleridgean line of sexual ambiguityruns. Destination as epic goal and as tragic fate or fatality. Destination istermination in Christabel. Poetry falls under sentence of death. Trance ends inparalysis and language in silence. In this poem, Coleridge created a daemonicplenum from which he could not escape. Wordsworth is annihilated, and Coleridgeis free. But his freedom has been purchased by sexual and metaphysicalenslavement, a shamanistic transformation so complete that the poet becameinvisible to readers, even though he is standing squarely before them.Christabel has an odd history. Its two parts were written in 1797 and 1800.Coleridge withheld it from publication, but it circulated privately inmanuscript. Its release in 1816 was at the urging of Byron, who loved it andcalled it the source of all of Sir Walter Scott’s verse tales. Coleridge neverregarded Christabel as done and claimed plans for three more parts. His mindreturned fretfully to the poem for years, and his inability to finish it was anabiding disappointment. For a century, critics have advanced various theories toaccount for this. The corpus of commentary on Christabel is very small. Probablyno poem in literary history has been so abused by moralistic Christian readings.Its blatant lesbian pornography has been ignored or blandly argued away.The Christian interpretation of Christabel found ample justification inColeridge’s remark to his friend Gillman that the theme of the final poem wouldbe “that the virtuous of this world save the wicked.” The contradictions betweenChristian sentiment and poetic vision are even more radical in Christabel thanin The Ancient Mariner. Little here supports what Coleridge declared his moralprogram. Piety is blasted by a night wind. Heaven is conquered by hell. Virtuedoes not and cannot redeem in the poem. The greatness of Christabel comes fromits lurid pagan pictorialism. It is an epiphany of evil. Mother nature returnsto retake what she lost. Christabel is a daemonic screenplay, a script for anapocalyptic comeback. Behold the star: the lesbian vampire Geraldine is thechthonian reawakened from its earthy grave.That daemonic vision is the true heart of Christabel is demonstrated byShelley’s reaction at first hearing. When in Geneva Byron recited some memorizedpassages, Shelley shrieked and rushed from the room. He was found trembling andbathed in sweat. During the description of Geraldine, he saw eyes in the nipplesof Mary Godwin, his future wife. This is reported by Polidori, who was present,and confirmed in a letter of Byron. Shelley’s vision of the archetypal phallicwoman shows that the poem’s amoral essence was instantaneously transmitted fromone great poet to another. Coleridge’s imagination is invested not in “thevirtuous of this world” but in daemonic personae of hermaphrodite force.Christabel is a psychologically archaizing poem. Far from proving Christiantruth, it abolishes Christianity and returns the psyche to a primitive world ofmalignant spirit-presences. Coleridge the Christian was the first misreader ofColeridge the poet.Christabel rewrites The Ancient Mariner by reversing its movement. Daemonicrevelation occurs not on the high seas but in the citadel of state. Evil invadesthe secret cells of body and mind. Christabel is a boudoir epic. Sex, the pointof intersection between man and nature, is contaminated. The poem opens with thelady Christabel leaving her father’s castle at midnight to pray for herbetrothed knight. As at the start of The Ancient Mariner, there is an impulsetoward conventional marriage that will be defeated. Christabel is an innocentwho believes love and virtue go together. Her mission of heterosexual piety willbe grotesquely defiled by the poem. Sex will turn and sting the Christian will.Christabel’s maiden voyage into archaic night is foolish and possiblyprovocative. She summons the very evil she hopes to quell. Neither Christianitynor Wordsworthian nature can defend her. A bleak, decadent sterility has turnedthe green leaves grey. Persephone in the meadow is about to be raped, but herassailant is the earth-mother and her dark prison her own home.Even as Christabel kneels in prayer, the daemonic drama begins. “It” has moaned,the brute sexless, sexfull thing, the stirring form of pagan nature waking fromits long sleep. The poet’s voice interjects: “Hush, beating heart of Christabel!/ Jesu, Maria, shield her well!” We recall another appeal to heaven in TheAncient Mariner, an appeal answered by a leprous vampire. The Coleridgean moralinversion operates again. Christian prayer produces pagan epiphany. Heaven iseither deaf or sadistic. The materialization of the vampires in Christabel andThe Ancient Mariner perversely awaits the invocation of a divine name. It is asif daemonic power is intensified by Christian assertion. A lust for profanationhangs in the air like a shadow-mist. It suddenly takes brilliant shape. In aburst of luminous, numinous cinema, the vampire Geraldine appears in all herwhite beauty. “Mary mother, save me now!” says Christabel, pressed by that harshColeridgean irony. The Madonna becomes the serpent in the garden. In herembrace, Christabel will fall; her touch will be the mark of Cain exilingChristabel from her race. Christabel’s trust and good will are a blank spot oftender passivity in nature, as in Blake’s Spenserian “Infant Joy.” The benign isdevoured by its context, hungry black flames of daemonic energy.Geraldine gives birth to herself by “the infinite I AM” of Coleridgeanimagination. She is poetry leaping full-armed from the unconscious, ahermaphrodite Muse. The voices of art in Coleridge prophesy not peace but war.Art is conflict, turbulence, negation. And art mirrors nature, from whichWordsworth has finally been driven. The vampire Muse makes poetry in Christabelby seduction and corruption. Poisoned words will lead to poisoned sex. She liesin order to lay. “Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear!” Geraldine says toChristabel. After a long falsehood, the invitation is repeated, this timesuccessfully. Geraldine seems to evoke the unconscious complicity of her prey.Bloom rightly calls Christabel a “half-willing victim.”10[ch25_notes.html#ch12note10a]The vampire’s satanic temptations are garnished by spurious sex-romance. Sheassumes the frailest feminine persona. Five warriors have kidnapped her from herfather’s house and abandoned her: “Me, even me, a maid forlorn.” The irony ofGeraldine’s tale of rape is that she is herself a rapist. What Christabel hearsis what is to be done to her. Psychologically, the tale translates to: men arebrutes! This is how Geraldine severs Christabel’s mental connection with herbetrothed knight and induces her to give her hand. The daemonic mother lures thebride backward, away from menarche into the womb of regression. In Coleridge’splan for the conclusion, Geraldine was to impersonate Christabel’s fiancé, bytranssexual ruse. In Part I, we see that Geraldine has already replaced him.Once Geraldine has won her first victory, she has won everything. She has madeher first penetration of Christabel’s psyche and now manipulates her thoughts.It is Christabel who introduces the idea of “stealth” and who proposes theyshare the same bed. From such covertness come erotic intensity, trespass, andshame.Geraldine’s strategies are modelled on Spenser. Her woeful tale echoes the onetold by duplicitous Duessa to the Redcrosse Knight in the first book of TheFaerie Queene. In the forest Geraldine recalls Belphoebe and in the castleMalecasta. Christabel’s sexual style, its combination of cool medieval beautywith voluptuous embowered evil, is uniquely Spenserian. Coleridge, like Blake,senses the decadent perversity in Spenser. Christabel’s rape theme comes fromthe rapeinfested Faerie Queene. But virginity has lost its Christian militancy.No armour defends Coleridge’s heroine against sexual predators. Christabel’ssimple femininity is her undoing. Daemonic rapacity surges into her andobliterates her maidenhood. She is no match for hermaphrodite aggression. Thereis no longer a working Christian scheme to divert lust into sublimation. TheSpenserian bower where Christabel is lost is her own.Invitation to the rape: from Christabel’s hospitable gesture to her actualseduction there are 140 lines. A long distance must be traversed. The Mariner’sepic voyage is internalized. But “the moat” is crossed at the moment ofChristabel’s assent. This is her Rubicon, from which there is no turning back.The 140 lines are a dreamlike sarabande, both funeral and wedding march. Instages drawn from Shakespeare’s Rape of Lucrece, the poem follows each step ofGeraldine’s invasion of gate, court, hall, chamber. The castle of Christabel’sfather resembles the metaphorical ruined castle of Goethe’s Werther. InColeridge, the male castle of society and history is entered and disordered bythe chthonian. But the castle is also Christabel’s body, which is systematicallypossessed by Geraldine. The “little door” unlocked by Christabel’s key is herown chastity.At the gate, Geraldine sinks down, and Christabel must carry her through it.Bloom says, “Geraldine cannot cross the threshold, which probably is charmedagainst her.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note11a] In old Scandinavia, an ax wasburied beneath the threshold to guard a house against lightning—and to prevent awitch from entering. Similarly, ancient cities were protected by founders’ bonesentombed in the gate lintel. Jackson Knight, we saw, shows that virgin goddesseswere patrons of cities because the integrity of walls was imagined as a virgin’shymen. Hence the Trojan horse brought down Troy: as it passed the gate, it brokethe magic spell protecting the city. Taboos governing the sanctity of walls wereso strict that a Roman soldier who leapt the camp wall instead of leaving by thegate was executed, for he had broken the defenses; this appears to be whyRomulus kills Remus for jumping his new wall. Thus in Christabel, Geraldine’spassage through the iron gate from which an “army in battle array” has marchedis a Trojan subterfuge. Hidden in Christabel’s arms, she simultaneouslyoverthrows male power and penetrates the virgin’s body. She is the cunningsacker of cities, dangling from the lamb’s wool.Christabel’s breached gate is the doorway which could not be crossed in TheAncient Mariner. The Wedding-Guest has finally become the Bridegroom. Christabellifting Geraldine over the threshold is the groom with her bride. She has begunher daemonic marriage to Geraldine, from which there can be no divorce.Geraldine is “a weary weight,” the terrible burden of our physical life.Christabel staggers under the tree of nature upon which Blake sees us crucified.The doorway is Coleridge’s sexual crux, his via crucis. Geraldine’s advancethrough the castle will be recast by Poe in The Masque of the Red Death, wherebloody biology triumphs over all. Geraldine too is a masquer, mother nature whouses her Wordsworthian mask of beauty to hide her chthonian brutality. In Poethe midnight chamber holds a clock, in Coleridge a bed. Both are epiphanies ofmaternal power. Geraldine and Christabel’s slow passage has an abstractformality, a religious solemnity. Seduction (“leading astray”) becomesinduction, initiation into daemonic mysteries. The poem’s eroticism is generatedby this methodical movement, which inflames by anticipation and suspense.Darkness, seclusion, and silence accentuate Christabel’s tantalizing sexualvulnerability.The procession moves through the castle as if through a church, nave to chancelto altar, the bed of seduction. No guard or hierarch rises to block the queen’ssweep of the board. The presiding male, Sir Leoline, is ill and asleep. Thewatchdog, with animal instinct, moans but does not wake. Only in the bedchamberdoes Geraldine meet resistance, from the ghost of Christabel’s mother, aguardian spirit springing out like the sacristan of the sanctuary. The motherdied at the hour of Christabel’s birth, vowing she would hear the castle bellstrike twelve on her daughter’s wedding day. The poem begins with the tolling ofmidnight. So this is Christabel’s wedding day, and she is about to consummateher perverse nuptials. In this poem, good strangles itself; birth leads todeath: pregnancy is a terminal disease. The wine made by Christabel’s motherfrom wildflowers—presumably Wordsworth’s daffodils!—serves only to energize thevampire in her territorial war. Geraldine grapples with the ghost and repelsher: “Off, wandering mother! … this hour is mine…. ’tis given to me.” Given bywhom? God and fate take the side of evil. Archaic night makes her inexorablereturn.After her mother’s defeat, Christabel is completely at Geraldine’s mercy. Thetriumph of the daemonic is signified by Christabel kneeling at her side.Geraldine has subdued the cosmos of the poem, and she is now its deity.Christabel obeys without question Geraldine’s command to unrobe herself: “So letit be!” In other words, “I do.” They are married. She lies down in bed to awaither master. Like the poet of “Kubla Khan,” Christabel is a sacrificial victim,whom we actually see led to the altar and laying herself down nude upon it.Geraldine is Iphigenia meekly awaiting the stroke of the knife. Geraldine is thehigh priest praying before her bloody task—but she prays to herself, thedaemonic will. Murder here is sexual intercourse, for sex is how mother naturekills us, that is, how she enslaves the imagination. Nature draws first blood,of virgins, of us. Like “To William Wordsworth,” the poem climaxes in a paganritual sex act. Christabel’s ceremonialism continues in the deliberatepreparations for bed, a sexual mime. This is one of the points the ChristianColeridge tried to fudge. Twenty years after writing the poem, he inserted sevenlines (255–61) in which Geraldine “seeks delay” before laying down withChristabel and taking her in her arms. The reader must never be misled by theattempts of Coleridge the anxious reviser to cover the work of Coleridge thevisionary. Vampire and conscience are mutually exclusive. The poem in its fineoriginal inspiration presents a Geraldine who never hesitates, who cannothesitate, who is implacable.There is a mystery when Geraldine undresses. “Behold! her bosom and half herside— / A sight to dream of, not to tell! / O shield her! shield sweetChristabel!” What is revealed by the daemon’s unveiling? G. Wilson Knight speaksof “some sort of sexual desecration, some expressly physical horror.”12[ch25_notes.html#ch12note12a] In Part II, Christabel has a chilling flashback:“Again she saw that bosom old, / Again she felt that bosom cold.” Scholarsimmediately recognized this as a detail from The Faerie Queene: when beautifulDuessa is stripped, she has “dried dugs, like bladders lacking wind”(I.viii.47). Waking the next morning, Christabel sees her companion’s “heavingbreasts.” Geraldine must be a classic vampire of great age, her breast witheredonly when she hungers. After she has sated herself, whether by drinking blood orsomehow draining her victim’s life-energy, her breasts recover sensual fullness.In Part II, Christabel remembers “the touch and pain,” so something surgical hasdefinitely occurred!Whatever is repellent about Geraldine’s bosom, it is the identifying mark of awitch. In her study of European witch-cult, Margaret Murray describes anothermark, the “little Teat,” which appeared on odd parts of the body and “was saidto secrete milk and to give suck to the familiars, both human and animal.”Supernumerary breasts or nipples are a medical anomaly found on chest, abdomen,shoulder, buttock, or thigh.13 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note13a] A withered bosom,misplaced nipples, multiple breasts: the witch’s body is a perversion or parodyof the maternal. It is fitting, therefore, that Geraldine’s sole opponent isChristabel’s benevolent mother, and it is a severe truth about the poem thatthis power is crushed and expelled. The witch, with her animal teats, isvirtually a third sex. She is the ugliness of procreative nature. She is thechthonian mother who eats her children.A third sex: how does Geraldine sexually violate Christabel? Coleridge says ofthe two as they lie together:A star hath set, a star hath risen,O Geraldine! since arms of thineHave been the lovely lady’s prison.O Geraldine! one hour was thine—Thou’st had thy will!The star which has set is Jesus’. The star which has risen is the ancient signof the daemon, the sexual scorpion. The prison is the embrace of mother nature,from which Jesus cannot redeem us. Geraldine has had her “will” of Christabel.This locution belongs exclusively to male experience. It is not used of a womananywhere else in major literature. The sole analogy I find is in the journal ofVictoria Sackville-West, who describes carrying off her lover Violet Trefusis toa French hotel two days after the latter’s wedding: “I treated her savagely, Imade love to her, I had her, I didn’t care.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note14a] “Ihad her”: how strange the language of masculine possession sounds in a femalecontext. In Coleridge, female sexual receptivity is mysteriously transformedinto the power to rape. What happens? If there is draining of blood, it mustoccur with mentalized orgasmic excitement, like the cloudy feverishness ofCarmilla, J. Sheridan Le Fanu’s Victorian tale of a lesbian vampire obviouslyinspired by Christabel.Can there be a phallic subtext to this daemonic intercourse? There is anambiguity about the body of Spenser’s Duessa. Fradubio surprises her at herbath: “Her nether parts misshappen, monstrous, / Were hid in water, that I couldnot see, / But they did seeme more foule and hideous, / Than womans shape manwould beleeve to be” (I.ii.41). This is inconclusive, but when Duessa isunmasked, the poet speaks in his own voice: “Her nether parts, the shame of allher kind, / My chaster Muse for shame doth blush to write” (viii.48) He seems togive the most depraved female evil a penis. A modern British woman reported thatas she and the female medium sat nude at a London séance, an icy “phantom penis”left the medium’s genitals, crossed the space between them, and entered her.Rising from her bed next morning, Christabel says, “Sure I have sinn’d!” Sheremembers nothing, but her sense of lost innocence is acute, for the witch hasentered her, body and mind. Geraldine sleeps satisfied like a man; thetriumphant seducer, while the violated girl weeps in shame. She is humanityafter the fall. Her eyes are open. She knows we are naked, defenseless againstnature. Wordsworthian illusions about mother nature are over. Incest andcannibalism are the lovemaking of man’s family romance. Christabel has beenimpregnated by the Muse and bears the burden of fear and suffering. “The visionof fear, the touch and pain”: her sexual crucifixion is a spectacle ofsadomasochistic bondage. Her pain may be from the vampire’s bite or from deviantpenetration. In medieval covens, the Devil performed ritual public intercoursewith a forked penis, entering his devotees through two orifices. Initiation intoancient nature-cults always involved some abuse of the body, from flagellationto castration. In Christabel’s pagan epiphany, the daemon returns in an orgy ofDionysian pleasure-pain. Vampire and poem are a raptor-rapture of monstrosity.Geraldine’s daemonic aggression resides in her eye. Vampires have a phallic eye,probing, penetrating, riveting. In the hallway, the hearth fire flames, “AndChristabel saw the lady’s eye, / And nothing else saw she thereby.” She isobsessed, subjugated. At her moment of maximum power in the bedchamber,Geraldine rises to her full “lofty” height, an erection fueled by her dominanceof the mother-spirit, Christabel’s submission and genuflection, and the wine shechanges into Christabel’s blood. This is the full moon of the vampire eye: “Herfair large eyes ‘gan glitter bright.” Bloom says Geraldine, like the AncientMariner, is “a hypnotist or mesmerist.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note15a]Christabel’s seduction is a sexual hypnotism. Freud says the “blind obedience”of hypnosis comes from an “unconscious fixation of the libido on the person ofthe hypnotizer.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note16a] Thus Christabel spirituallyparticipates in her own defloration.Christabel’s hypnotism theme will recur in the mesmerism of Hawthorne’s TheBlithedale Romance. The lesbian tension between feminine Priscilla and willfulZenobia comes from the liaison of Christabel and Geraldine:As yet, the girl had not stirred. She stood near the door, fixing a pair oflarge, brown, melancholy eyes upon Zenobia,—only upon Zenobia!—she evidently sawnothing else in the room, save that bright, fair, rosy, beautiful woman. It wasthe strangest look I ever witnessed; long a mystery to me, and forever amemory…. She dropped down upon her knees, clasped her hands, and gazed piteouslyinto Zenobia’s face. Meeting no kindly reception, her head fell on her bosom.17[ch25_notes.html#ch12note17a]“And nothing else saw she thereby.” The look blotting out all else; the kneelingand dominance and submission: Hawthorne’s decadent eroticism is a homage toColeridge. Poe also recasts Geraldine as the fierce Ligeia and toothsomeBerenice, phallic fixators and revenants of the daemonic graveyard. AndColeridge’s lesbian couple will end up, by way of Hawthorne, in Henry James’sThe Bostonians, where Perseus rescues Andromeda from the seacoast hoard of thefeminist vampire.The phallic optics of Coleridge’s mystery poems arises from the war betweenvision and language that disrupts The Ancient Mariner. In Shelley’s sex vision,menacing female eyes signify the omnipotence and ubiquity of procreative nature.The daemonic turns man to stone. Jane Harrison calls the Gorgon an “incarnateEvil Eye”: “The monster was tricked out with cruel tusks and snakes, but it slewby the eye, it fascinated.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note18a] Fascination is theblack magic of art, love, and politics. Kenneth Burke remarks: “The theme offascination in Coleridge’s ‘Mystery Poems’ is that of an ambivalent power. Hegives us, as it were, a poetic thesaurus dictionary of terms ranging fromthoroughly ‘good’ fascination to thoroughly ‘bad’ fascination.”19[ch25_notes.html#ch12note19a] Fascination is ambivalent because love isambivalent. The Latin fascinare, “to enchant, bewitch, charm,” is related to theGreek baskainein, “to use ill words” as in slander but also “to bewitch byspells or by means of an evil eye.” Fascinare and baskainein are linguisticallyconnected to words of speaking, Latin farari and Greek phaskein, “to say.” Asshe lies down with Christabel, Geraldine says, “In the touch of this bosom thereworketh a spell, / Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!” Next morning,Christabel cannot tell her pain or appeal for help. Evil eye and magic spell:daemonic sorcery deprives its victim of speech, hurtling them backward throughhistory to the animal realm. Thus Circe’s most sadistic torture is stopping themouths of Odysseus’ men. Minds acute in their swine bodies, they can only grunt.Christabel’s heroine is plunged into muteness. Her “vision of fear” obliterateslanguage.The vampire’s power to fascinate derives from the snake’s legendary ability toimmobilize its prey by fixing its eyes upon it. The fear freezing an animal inits tracks and the fear paralyzing a person beneath the vampire’s gaze are oneand the same. It is an emanation of the cruel hierarchy of biology. The Gorgonwho petrifies and the vampire who seduces achieve their ends by suddenhierarchic assertion. That the penis is power is one of the social lies men tellthemselves to overcome their fear of the daemonism of sex. That woman can drainand paralyze is part of the latent vampirism in female physiology. The archetypeof the femme fatale began in prehistory and will live forever.The vampire’s authority is a form of charisma, the power enabling a leader tosuspend the will of his followers and induce them to sacrifice themselves forhis personal vision. Hitler, we noted, called the masses feminine: the abilityto entrance and focus the minds of a nation is a form of sexual seduction.Politics and theater were interrelated long before the age of mass media. Anactor with stage presence, innate authority, masters the audience. A“spellbinding” orator literally casts a spell. He “captures” attention. Anaudience is “captivated” or “enthralled,” meaning enslaved (a thrall is a slaveor bondman), when no one stirs restlessly or chatters to his neighbor, when it’s“so quiet you could hear a pin drop.” Metaphors of sex and power abound inpolitical and artistic performance. The speaker dominates the plane of eyecontact. All eyes are fixed on him, as if hypnotized. The audience is propelledinto immobilization and muteness, ancient prerogatives of the daemon. Actor andfiction operate on an audience by subduing the rebellious body and fixing themind on one spirit-governing focal point. Fascination is becalming, thatcondition of erotic passivity in which the Ancient Mariner sees the vampire ofnature at sea. Vision, silence, castration. We are approaching the sexual centerof Coleridge’s mystery poems.Fascination is both the theme and genesis of Christabel. Part I ends withChristabel still in Geraldine’s arms. I will argue that this encompasses thetotality of Coleridge’s vision and that the second part written three yearslater, as well as his rough plan for three more parts, was born of fear at whathe had already created. Christabel remained unfinished because, try as he might,Coleridge could not turn his daemonic saga into a parable of Christianredemption. Even Part II ends with Christabel’s father abandoning her andallying himself with false Geraldine. Coleridge’s conscious mind wills thevictory of virtue. But his unconscious replies: evil is older and will endure.Part I, ending, says of Christabel, “But this she knows, in joys and woes, /That saints will aid if men will call: / For the blue sky bends over all!”Christian interpreters have missed the terrible irony of these lines. ForColeridge, we saw, calling heavenly powers brings disaster. Christabel suffersfrom the pathos of rationalization of Blake’s exploited chimney sweeps. She islike the rape victims of The Faerie Queene, whose femininity invites disaster,or the heroine of Sade’s Justine, or Good Conduct Well Chastised (originallycalled The Misfortunes of Virtue). Good is actually a titillation to lust andprovokes the vampire’s assault. Paganism stakes its claim in the virgin heart ofChristian virtue.The transition from Part I to Part II is jarring. We pass from sinisterdreaminess to farce. The poem goes flat. Unimportant people pop up and downringing bells and telling beads. We meet Christabel’s father, Sir Leoline, whomthe poet should have left snoring. Scholars have noticed the sudden loss ofmythic intensity but have neither explored nor explained it. Humphrey House, forexample, says, “The two parts differ so much from each other, that they scarcelyseem to belong to the same poem.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note20a] I must amendmy critique: there are two fine passages in Part II. The first depicts Geraldineand Christabel waking together in the bedchamber (360–86). The second recordsthe bard Bracy’s ominous vision of a “bright green snake” coiled about a dove’sbody (547–56). But both these passages reinvoke the sexual intercourse of PartI. In other words, the best poetry of Part II has been produced by daemonicinfection from Part I, a contagion of vice.Why is Part I so much stronger? The poem’s greatness resides in the seductivevampirism of Geraldine. It was inspired by a vision of a female persona ofoverwhelming force. Everything in the poem is subordinated to Geraldine.Coleridge manipulates character, time, and place to form an admiring circleabout her, from which she radiates her cold hieratic glamour like a sun king.Christabel is structured by an archaic technique of ornamental display, a ritualexhibitionism. Gods descend when man is in crisis, but the daemon ascends fromher bed of ghostly loam. Heterosexuality has failed: maternalism is weak andmasculinity in decay, the father’s armour a musty relic. Art can see but notact: the bard warns but is not believed. Father spurns daughter in Lear-likedisloyalty.The world of Christabel has run down and is ripe for apocalypse. Into thisvacuum steps the lesbian vampire, dazzlingly beautiful, relentlessly masculine.Like As You Like It, Christabel is an alchemic experiment whose main event isthe crystallization of a rebis or hermaphroditic personality. The poem is analembic of superheated psyche. Energy is released and rebonded. Vampires makevampires: Christabel, “hissing,” has been genetically altered, irradiated by thedaemonic. Fascination, capture, possession, transfiguration.Christabel is Coleridge dreaming aloud. Kathleen Coburn thinks Coleridge couldnot finish the poem “because it was too closely a representation of his ownexperience.” She connects Geraldine’s advances to the poet’s nightmares, “inwhich one gathers he was frequently pursued by unpleasing female figures”:“Geraldine is a malignity out of Coleridge’s own dreams.”21[ch25_notes.html#ch12note21a] Here, from his notebooks, are two such dreams:a most frightful Dream of a Woman whose features were blended with darknesscatching hold of my right eye & attempting to pull it out—I caught hold of herarm fast—a horrid feel—Wordsworth cried out aloud to me hearing my scream—I was followed up & down by a frightful pale woman who, I thought, wanted tokiss me, & had the property of giving me a shameful Disease by breathing in theface& again I dreamt that a figure of a woman of a gigantic Height, dim & indefinite& smokelike appeared—& that I was forced to run up toward it—22[ch25_notes.html#ch12note22a]Coleridge records many dreams of sexual assault, some by males. Once he feels aman “leaping on me, & grasping my Scrotum.” Bostetter sees the similaritybetween Geraldine and Coleridge’s nightmare woman, whose size Norman Frumanconnects to that of the “tall” and “lofty” Geraldine.23[ch25_notes.html#ch12note23a] If Geraldine is the imposing figure who pursuesColeridge in his dreams, then we must logically infer some element ofself-identification in Christabel. Coburn says Christabel is “significantly oneside of his own nature.” But these insights, which should have been soconsequential for interpretation of the mystery poems, are left undeveloped,tottering on the edge of the sexually problematic but not plunging into it.Christabel contains one of the greatest transsexual self-transformations inliterature. I spoke of the drama of the male heroine in The Ancient Mariner, acomplex of self-identification sliding into sentimentality. In Christabel, theresidual maleness of the male heroine is gone, and gender has shifted completelyto the female. Christabel is Coleridge, a poet condemned to fascination by thedaemonic. The poem begins a peculiar nineteenth-century tradition in which asexually ambivalent poet paints a scene of intense lesbian eroticism in order toidentify himself, by a daring warp of imaginative gender, with the passivepartner. Balzac’s Byronic (and therefore Coleridgean) The Girl with the GoldenEyes starts the French version of this theme, which produces Baudelaire’sDelphine and Hippolyte, from which in turn come Swinburne’s Anactoria andVerlaine’s and Pierre Louÿs’ Sapphic idylls. Christabel is a ritual of surrenderto pagan corruption. Its heroine is entranced, morally drugged, powerless toflee from an irresistible power. The vampire Geraldine, an enlargement of thesea-witch of The Ancient Mariner, is the dominatrix of Coleridge’s psychic andpoetic life. She is cruel mother nature, whose second coming lays Wordsworth torest. She will take Coleridge beyond rescue, to the entombed inner place whereWordsworth cannot hear his night cry.Clues within the poem corroborate the identification of Coleridge withChristabel. The bard dreams of Sir Leoline’s pet dove, named for Christabel,lost in the forest, “a bright green snake / Coiled around its wings and neck”:“With the dove it heaves and stirs, / Swelling its neck as she swelled hers!” Hewakes as the clock strikes twelve. It is the hour of Christabel’s marriage, nowbeing consummated: dove and snake, locked together, heave, stir, and swell inspasms of pain and ecstasy. Coleridge was drawn to this hybrid image. In“Dejection” (1802), he declares: “Hence, viper thoughts, that coil around mymind, / Reality’s dark dream!” His opium addiction, he once said, was a way of“escaping from pains that coiled round my mental powers as a serpent around thebody and wings of an eagle!” Thus this metaphor, where he is a bird in the gripof a snake, abode with the poet. Man’s body is the mortal coil, and imaginationis the serpent-stung bird that cannot fly. Man lies in chains of sex and nature.Next is the curse laid by Geraldine on Christabel’s power of speech, keeping herfrom informing her father of the rape. This detail must come from the ancienttale of Philomela, a rape victim whose tongue is cut out to ensure her silence.Coleridge mentions her in “The Nightingale” (1798). “O’er-mastered by the mightyspell,” Christabel can utter only a single sentence. Her hermaphrodite spouse is“lord of her utterance.” Christabel is like Melville’s Billy Budd, an innocentensnared by a homosexual conspirator and undone by a speech impediment.Christabel struggling to speak is a prophetic self-portrait of Coleridge thepoet, whose achievement was abortive. By modern standards, Coleridge left anenormous body of work of vast scope. But he died under the burden of greatexpectations, his own and others’. His masterpiece evaded him. Poetry came tohim only in fragments. Hence his apologia, needless to us, for “Kubla Khan,”with its spurious knock on the door. Toward the end of life, Coleridge wrote inhis notebooks, “From my earliest recollection I have had a consciousness ofPower without Strength—a perception, an experience, of more than ordinary powerwith an inward sense of weaknesse.” Hazlitt said of him, “His nose, the rudderof the face, the index of the will, was small, feeble, nothing—like what he hasdone.”24 [ch25_notes.html#ch12note24a] Coleridge thought he had “a feeble,unmanly face”: “The exceeding weakness, strengthlessness, in my face, was everpainful to me.” After first meeting him, Carlyle said, “His cardinal sin is thathe wants will. He has no resolution.”Christabel mute is Coleridge irresolute. Her truncated speech is like LewisCarroll’s stammer, which appeared in the challenging company of adults, neverchildren. Carroll portrays himself in Alice as the earth-bound, dowagerlike Dodobird, whose name is how Charles Dodgson would have stammered his own last name.Christabel’s inability to speak is Coleridge stammering. It represents withinthe poem the poet’s inability to complete the poem itself. Thus the spell laidupon Christabel is also laid upon Coleridge. It is his struggle with language,his fear of betrayal by and helpless alienation from language. The inability tospeak is a dark spot in the poem, a melanoma that may spread and stop allpoetry. The danger is that Coleridge will become a Philomela with her tonguetorn out. Kiss but don’t tell. The dark spot is a place of dangerous visionwhere words have not coalesced. It is a magic circle of frail tissue where thereshould be bone, like the soft spot on a baby’s head. I think of the first greatscript of Rod Serling’s Twilight Zone, “Little Girl Lost,” where a hole in abedroom wall sucks a child into another dimension. So in the boudoir-dominatedChristabel, the failure of speech is a zone of desolation that may drawColeridge’s poetry into nonbeing. The vampire Muse of Christabel is a Sphinx,the Greek “Strangler.” She is the riddle of nature that the poet cannot solve.She brings vision but steals speech. Geraldine is the mother of lies. Theserpent in the garden is a suave forked tongue, eating and entering thesanctified body of innocence.Thus Coleridge as Christabel is a tongueless male heroine who is no longeridentifiably male. He is the “coy maid half yielding to her lover” in “TheEolian Harp” and the “woman wailing for her demon-lover” in “Kubla Khan.”Christabel in the vampire’s arms is a lyre sadistically played upon by daemonicnature. But her music is silence. The story of nature cannot be told, for shewill always betray the heart that loves her. By land and by sea: the AncientMariner’s compulsive storytelling is an early, lesser version of Christabel’smuteness. The Mariner tries to solve by excess of words the mystery thatsilences Christabel. Christabel (Part I) is the profounder poem. It is notmarred by The Ancient Mariner’s sentimentality; its language is dignified,seamless. Why? The Wedding-Guest cannot get through the doorway of The AncientMariner because he is still male. The marriage may go on, but he will not seeit. In Christabel, the doorway is breached and the marriage occurs because thepoet has jettisoned his gender. He disappears into his heroine and marries hisMuse, who will speak for him. Geraldine is a ventriloquist. She writes the poem,and Christabel suffers it. Coleridge at his sexually most self-abased is at hispoetically most potent. Art transfigures by self-mutilation.Extremes meet in Christabel: vice and virtue, male and female, nature andsociety. All is dominated by the daemon. There is no more of the AncientMariner’s self-pity, only moral, emotional, and sexual extremity. Christabel isa perfection of extremity. It is a hierosgamos, an unholy marriage, and theboudoir is a mountaintop of vision, where the poet is mounted by the Muse. As in“To William Wordsworth,” it is an epiphany, a peak experience. Geraldine is thepoetic will, pure primeval id. As in “Kubla Khan,” those struck by prophecy aretrapped in taboo. Christabel is shunned, persecuted. Touched, touching,untouchable. Elected by the daemonic, she is made, that is both violated andinitiated. Like Clodius in drag, Coleridge penetrates the ancient mysteries.Paganism sweeps back into culture. A new phase of history is kicked off by rape.Christabel, I think, is one source of Yeats’s “Leda and the Swan.” Geraldine isthe brute god who stuns, rapes, and abandons.The poem’s Christian theme has been completely misread. Christabel is theChristian Coleridge, the hopeful moralist perpetually defeated by the daemonic.The she-that-is-he will never emerge from her enslavement. In Christabel,Christianity is abolished by a return of the chthonian. The “love and charity”ending Part I are the epitaph of the Christian Coleridge. Virtue is invoked onlyto increase the Sadean perversity of transgression. The rape is more passionate,more evil because of the borderlines set up for it to overcome. Christabel, thebeautiful Christ, meets her ruin in the barbaric ugliness of mother nature, theold, cold bosom where every man is born and buried.Christabel is a sexual apocalypse in which Coleridge no longer sees thehermaphrodite god through a glass darkly but face to face. His fascination byGeraldine has made her the autocratic tyrannos of the poem, to the detriment ofeverything in Part II. She illustrates a principle I call psychoiconicism: itgoverns literary works whose primary inspiration is an experimental, charismaticpersona, appearing epiphanically, in iconic frontality. The figure is investedwith so much psychic power that other characters lose fictive energy and fadeinto the background. Sir Leoline, for example, is merely a sketch, part of thedécor. Psychoiconicism resembles the register method of Egyptian wall art, wherethe hierarchically central figure is three times larger than lesser mortals.Psychoiconicism is produced by the west’s obsessive ritualization ofpersonality. Spenser’s Amazonian Belphoebe is psychoiconistic. Her scale ofrepresentation is startlingly disproportionate to that of characters around her,with whom her dramatic interaction is awkward and stilted. Psychoiconicismaccounts for the inequality between Rosalind and her admirers in As You Like Itand for the expository patchiness of Woolf’s transsexual Orlando. Hermaphroditevisions have a life of their own. They are vampires upon their own texts.Geraldine is one of the greatest androgynes of art. She has a refined femininebeauty but a masculine spirit. She is like the narcissistic witch-queen of SnowWhite, the wicked stepmother of fairy tales who is a projection of the repressednegativity of and toward the real mother. Christabel protests her father’salliance with Geraldine like a child refusing to accept a widower’s new wife.The poem’s lesbianism is paralleled by the family romance of Snow White, inwhich Bloom sees traces of mother-daughter incest. Walt Disney’s Snow White,which I saw at three, had the same stunning effect on me that Christabel did onShelley. The witch-queen is a persona lying utterly outside the moral universeof Christianity. It is a pre-Christian form of the malevolent nature mother.In Christabel, pagan imagism triumphs over the Judeo-Christian word. It isfitting, therefore, that the only modern parallels to Geraldine occur in cinema,our machine of the aggressive eye. Marlene Dietrich in Morocco, Maria Casarès inOrphée and Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne, Lauren Bacall in Young Man with aHorn, Stéphane Audran in Les Biches: elegance, sophistication, composure, coldlesbian will. The vampire eye penetrates space and time. Christabel’s voyeurism,like that of The Faerie Queene, reflects the unacknowledged voyeurism of westernart. The vampire, as we see from the replay from Geraldine’s point of view inthe Conclusion to Part I, has been watching all along, and most evilly, shemakes the defeated mother watch the rape of her own daughter. The thousandhungry eyes of daemonic nature wait in the forest of the night.Christabel is a pornographic parable of western sex and power. It is the EnglishFaust. Domination and seduction are at the center of western knowing.Coleridge’s self-immolating male heroines descend through Poe and Dostoyevsky toKafka, whose crucified cockroach is a comic version of mute Christabel.Defloration in Christabel is Wordsworth despoiled, his happy flowering fieldsstripped to reveal nature’s brute chthonian substratum. Christabel shows theconflict, hostility, and ambivalence in love and poetry. It rebukes the liberalidealizers of emotion. Coleridge’s lifelong desire to “finish” the poem wasmisconceived. His additions to it, like the nervous marginalia of The AncientMariner, are a form of self-thwarting, another stammering. They are a blatantdeflection of the poem’s authentic inspiration, where the vampire has anauthoritarian glamour and supernatural self-assurance. Geraldine is the daemonicspirit of archaic night, and in Coleridge’s original and truer conception, herpower has no beginning and no end."},{"pageContent":"13SPEED AND SPACEByronThe second generation of English Romantic poets inherited the achievement of thefirst. Byron, Shelley, and Keats read and absorbed Wordsworth and Coleridge’spoems and gave them new form. The younger men created the myth of the doomedRomantic artist. All three went into exile and died young, in pagan Italy andGreece. Publicity and fashion made them sex-heroes of European high society:they were real-life sexual personae, as Blake, Wordsworth, and Coleridge werenot. The poems of Byron, Shelley, and Keats are theatrical gestures ofself-definition. The first Romantic generation released the psychic energy inwhich the second swam and sometimes drowned. Achieving freedom is one problem,surviving freedom another. The early deaths of Byron, Shelley, and Keatsdemonstrate the intolerable pressures in the Romantic and liberal world-view.Blake and Wordsworth wanted identity without personality: but personality isultimate western reality. Byron, Shelley, and Keats had a love-hate relationshipwith personality, their own and others’.Lord Byron makes Romantic incest stunningly explicit. I see Manfred (1817) as across-fertilization of Goethe’s Faust with Wordsworth’s Tintern Abbey. Byron’spassionate hero is tormented by guilt for some mysterious crime. He is obsessedwith his dead sister Astarte, his twin in eyes, face, and voice. Byron relishessexual criminality. Forbidden love makes his characters superhuman. Rejectingall social relationships, Manfred seeks only himself in sexually transmutedform. Wordsworth’s sister allows him to remain alone, sex-free, but Astarte(Phoenician Venus) lures Manfred into the vertigo of sex.The sister-spirit appears in Manfred at exactly the point where she materializesin Tintern Abbey. Astarte died in Manfred’s tower when her heart “wither’d”while gazing on his. She has no tomb. What happened? Where is she? Manfred’swestern lust for knowledge annihilates his sister, like Faust with Gretchen.Oscar Wilde reimagines the scene in the climax of The Picture of Donan Gray,where two doubles, a man and his portrait, confront each other in a locked atticroom. The man is found dead, hideously “withered”—Byron’s word.1[ch25_notes.html#ch13note1a] Astarte, gazing at her brother’s heart as if into amirror, dies of daemonic narcissism. Brother and sister trespass the borderlinesof western identity and exchange personality. Manfred merges too fiercely withhis sister. He assimilates her. How else explain the disappearance of her body?Manfred’s union with his sister is a solipsistic sex-experiment that fails. Hisrestlessness and remorse are symptoms of his engorgement by her. Like Thyestes,Manfred has eaten his own flesh; like Kronos, he must vomit it out. Because realsexual relations have occurred between Manfred and his double, the physicalworld becomes intolerable to him. Byron’s poem is surreailstically expanded inPoe’s The Fall of the House of Usher, where the sister, entombed in theskull-like house, returns as a bloody apparition to stalk her hystericalbrother. In Byron, the sisterspirit’s materialization promises psychic relief.Manfred appeals to her to speak, so she can regain her autonomy and stayexternalized. But she only prophesies her brother’s death and disappears. I saysister collapses back into brother, renewing his sufferings.In Tintern Abbey, Wordsworth’s sister does not need to speak. She is the animain correct relation to the poet. The intercourse of brother and sister isspiritual, not physical. In Manfred, fraternal intercourse is violent andvoracious. Blood is shed, which Manfred hallucinates on a wine cup. He hasruptured his sister’s virginity. The blood-rimmed cup from which he cannot drinkis a nightmare vision of the locus of violation. It is also his bloody mind andbloody tongue, thinking and speaking against nature.Like Coleridge’s Christabel, Manfred centers on a ritual sex act defying socialand moral law. In the poem’s pagan cult of self-worship, matrimony, communion,and last rites are simultaneous. The ritual victim is torn by the phallic knifeand her flesh consumed. Astarte is tombless because she has been perverselyabsorbed, body and soul, by her brother. As in Poe’s The Tell-Tale Heart,Manfred is tormented by the internal presence of another being, illegitimatelyenwombed like a daemonic fetus. Manfred is the Romantic solipsist who hasdevoured the universe, but it sickens within him. Amputation or self-gorging?Kleist’s Achilles makes one choice, Byron’s Manfred another. The self is out ofsync with the object-world, which floods in or cruelly withdraws, marooningWordsworth’s puckered solitaries. In Manfred Byron makes illicit sex the listsof combat. Romantic sexual personae scratch and claw in attraction andrepulsion.Rumor said Byron committed incest with his half-sister, Augusta Leigh. True orfalse, the story added to his fame. Incest obsessively recurs in Byron’s poems.Cain turns the issue into legal conundrum. God allows incest for mankind’ssecond generation, who must marry their siblings. The poem dwells on the mutuallove of Cain and his twin sister, incredulous at the prohibition of fraternalsexuality to their own children. In “Parisina,” the Phaedra-like incest isbetween wife and stepson, an exception to Byron’s favorite brother-sisterpattern. Originally, Byron’s central characters in “The Bride of Abydos” werebrother and sister in love. In the final version, they are first cousins. Buttheir infatuation dates from childhood, and the girl still believes the boy herbrother when, feverishly kissing him, she rejects an arranged marriage. Byronsays, “Great is their love who love in sin and fear” (“Heaven and Earth”).Incest is sexual dissent. Its value is in impurity. Byron would spurn Blakeaninnocence. He takes the Sadean approach to sex and psyche: make a line, so I cancross it. Unlike Blake or Wordsworth, Byron wants to reinforce the boundaries ofself. In incest, libido moves out and back, making a uroboros-circle ofregression and dynastic exclusiveness.Romanticism’s feminization of the male persona becomes effeminacy in Byron. Theunmanly hero of “The Bride of Abydos” is stranded among women. Incestuousfeeling is incubated in an Oriental haze. “The Corsair” introduces seductiveGulnare, to appear transvestite in a sequel. Gulnare’s relations with thecorsair are like Kleist’s Penthesilea with Achilles, a dancelike exchange ofstrength and weakness. There are heroic rescues, then capture, humiliation, andrecovery. Byron ritualistically elaborates each stage of assertion andpassivity, making the narrative a slow masque of sexual personae.Until the end of “Lara,” Byron teasingly implies that the effeminate pageboy,Kaled, is homo sexually attached to the chieftain Lara. The truth outs when Larais killed and the boy faints. Bystanders reviving him loosen his garments anddiscover Kaled is the woman Gulnare, in love with the corsair Lara. Byron’srippling poetry makes sexual metamorphosis happen before our eyes. First we areadmiring “the glossy tendrils” of a beautiful boy’s “raven hair.” Suddenly, heswoons into sensuous passivity. Now we join the voyeuristic marvelling at publicexposure of a woman’s breasts, as she lies unconscious. Homosexual andheterosexual responses have been successively induced or extorted from thereader. The blink-of-an-eye sex change recalls Spenser’s switch of sexualperspective, but Byron retains his woman’s male name to prolong her sexualambiguity. Surely Gautier imitates this scene in Mademoiselle de Maupin, when apage is knocked unconscious from his horse and his shirt parted to reveal agirl’s “very white bosom.” I think it all ends up in National Velvet (1944, fromEnid Bagnold’s novel), where a fallen jockey, played by the young ElizabethTaylor, is carried unconscious from the race course. The motif is now safelysanitized: a doctor, not titillated passersby, undrapes the succulent bosom.“Lara”’s sex games echo Byron’s own. After leaving Cambridge, Byron had anaffair with a girl whom he dressed as a boy and called his brother. G. WilsonKnight suggests Lady Caroline Lamb masqueraded as a pageboy to rekindle thepoet’s fading passion.2 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note2a] Byron probably modelsKaled’s service to Lord Lara on that of transvestite Viola to Duke Orsino inTwelfth Night. Byron’s responses are as bisexual as Shakespeare’s. He is equallyand even simultaneously aroused by an effeminate boy and a bold cross-dressingwoman. Byron’s last poems are addressed to a handsome Greek youth with whom hewas unhappily infatuated. His early poems to “Thyrza” were inspired by aCambridge choirboy, probably John Edleston. The boy has a female name partlybecause the poems could not have been published otherwise. But this is also anexample of my principle of sexual metathesis, a shift in gender producing aspecial eroticism. We feel it in Byron’s lascivious delight in “Lara”’s open-airspectacle of sexual unmasking—the topos of deblousing, recreating the mood ofthe naughty Italian romances purified by Shakespeare.In Sardanapalus (1821), Byron vies directly with Shakespeare. The poem recastsAntony and Cleopatra—with the hero as Antony and Cleopatra. In a prefatory note,Byron claims he got the story from Diodorus Siculus. The Greek Sardanapalus borelittle resemblance to the Assyrian king and general, Assurbanipal. Delacroix’scrimson tableau shows Byron’s Sardanapalus amid the decadent conflagration ofempire. Byron begins his poem as Shakespeare begins his play: a hostilebystander scorns the sexual degeneracy of the protagonist, who enters for ourinspection. In Shakespeare, the cynical commentary is contradicted by Antony andCleopatra’s love. Byron’s Sardanapalus, however, is just as unmanly as foretold.He sweeps onstage crowned with flowers and “effeminately dressed,” followed by atrain of women and young slaves. Sardanapalus is Euripides’ Dionysus with hisMaenads—but now Dionysus is king. We are in Shakespeare’s Egypt, a liquid realmof woman, music, and perfume. Maleness dissolves. The king’s companions includeeunuchs, “beings less than women.” Sardanapalus’ brother-in-law calls him “thegrandson of Semiramis, the man-queen.” Who’s the queen, Semiramis orSardanapalus? Calling his hero a “sheking,” a “she Sardanapalus,” Byron developsan entire character out of Antony’s transvestite game. Sardanapalus denies he isa soldier and denounces the word and all who identify with it. Byron tries toargue that Sardanapalus’ manhood is more comprehensive than the ordinary. Butmorality is not the Romantic strong suit. Byron quickly flits off into sexualcaprice, his best manner. Sardanapalus’ feminized masculinity is far fromefficacious. His kingdom is destroyed, and he with it.Sardanapalus is an experiment in personae: how far can a male protagonist beshifted toward the female extreme without total loss of masculinity? Theenervation in Sardanapalus is more extreme than anything in Antony andCleopatra, which bursts with Renaissance energy. In his journal Byron speaks ofthe delightful “calm nothingness of languour” and elsewhere describes a“voluptuous state, / At once Elysian and effeminate” (“The Island”). Thisfloating condition sabotages Sardanapalus. The king laments the heaviness ofobjects, as if his muscles have atrophied. Sardanapalus is western personalitysubmerged in Dionysian flux. When military crisis forces him into the socialworld, reality seems stubbornly dense.Sardanapalus’ most masculine moment is his arming for battle, prefigured inShakespeare when Cleopatra acts as Antony’s arms-bearer. Sardanapalus calls forhis cuirass, baldric, helmet, spear—and mirror. He flings away his helmetbecause it doesn’t look good. The king of Assyria, who should be psychinghimself up for battle, seems more like a lady trying on hats. Shakespeare’s herois attended by his lover. In Byron, the lover becomes a mirror. Sardanapalus isthe complete Romantic hero, in love with his mirror-image. He is his ownaudience and critic, a projected eye. Byron nullifies Sardanapalus’ manhood withfeminine narcissism. We saw this pattern in Lewis’ The Monk, where each sexualmovement immediately swings in the opposite direction. Sardanapalus risks hislife by fighting bare-headed, apparently because he wants to show off “hisflowing hair.” This hair belongs to the poet of Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan,” whosesexual ambiguity Byron divines. Byron attaches Coleridge’s whole line to theking’s Amazon slave, Myrrha (Dante’s incestuous sinner), who strides into battlewith “her floating hair and flashing eyes.” Poets, unlike critics, sense the sexand decadence in art.As a program for androgyny, Sardanapalus is unconvincing. I find the poem moreominous than does Knight, who praises the “poet-like” hero for “joining man’sreason to woman’s emotional depth.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note3a] Sardanapalusseems too vain and whimsical to lead a nation, or even produce art. The brawlingCleopatra gets more done. The effeminacy of Byron’s hero is perverse, not ideal.Sardanapalus’ richness of Shakespearean reference raises an interestingquestion. Byron always spoke negatively of Shakespeare. Lady Blessingtonconcluded Byron must be feigning animosity, since he knew so much Shakespeare byheart. Bloom’s anxiety of influence would suggest that Byron owed Shakespearetoo much and was determined to deny it, even to himself.In Don Juan (1819–24), his longest and greatest poem, Byron invents anothersexually unconventional hero. The seducer Don Juan, a Renaissance Spaniard, isone of the west’s unique sexual personae. In contrast to Mozart’s Don Giovanni,Byron’s Don Juan is smaller, shyer, more “feminine.” He is “a most beauteousboy,” “slight and slim, / Blushing and beardless,” perfect as “one of theseraphim” (VIII. 52; IX.53, 47). Juan is partly Byron and partly what Byronlikes in boys. Knight, Frye, and Bloom comment on the hero’s sexual passivitytoward dominant women.4 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note4a] When Juan is sold as aslave in Constantinople, a eunuch forces him into female clothing, supplementedby makeup and judicious tweezing. Juan has caught the sultana’s eye. Bytransvestism he can be smuggled into the harem for her pleasure. Byron’ssensual, self-enclosed harem world is like Blake’s rose, femaleness multipliedand condensed in a small humid circle.The sultana Gulbeyaz is one of Romanticism’s most potent women. Don Juancontinues Sardanapalus’ maneuvering of an effeminate male along the sexualspectrum. Juan’s tenuous manhood is near-obliterated by female drag. Now Byronshoves him next to an Amazon dominatrix. Juan in petticoats is a trembling pawnupon whom the raging queen bears down. Gulbeyaz is the Cleopatra missing fromSardanapalus. She is the androgyne as virago, luxuriously female in body butharshly male in spirit. Gulbeyaz has Cleopatra’s vigorous duality: her “largeeyes” show “half-voluptuousness and half-command.” She is “imperial, orimperious,” with a haughty smile of “self-will.” Her eyes “flash’d always fire,”blending “passion and power” (V.108, 110–11, 134, 116). Gulbeyaz wears a maleponiard at her waist. Byron’s sultana will end up as a smouldering Spanishmarquise in Balzac’s The Girl with the Golden Eyes, where that poniard is drawnand dreadfully used.Gulbeyaz’s entrance into the poem overwhelms Don Juan’s residual masculinity.Introduced as a girl to sultan and harem, he blushes and shakes. Byron choosesnot to defend his hero’s virility and mischievously absents himself to take thesexually external point of view. Poor Juan is now simply “she” and “her.” EvenSpenser, after briefing the reader, allows his transvestites their properpronoun. In the next canto, Byron allows “he” intermittent return. But it isrudely jostled by the harem’s unflagging attention to the newcomer: “Her shape,her hair, her air, her everything” (VI.35). Gossip, admiration, envy: Juan’sfemale alter ego is fixed by and projected to a captive audience. Asked hisname, Juan replies “Juanna.” And Juanna he is called for the rest of the Turkishepisode, even by Byron himself. This sex transformation of his own name is asign of Juan’s developing sexual complicity, like Coleridge’s Christabel liftingthe vampire over the threshold. Apologizing for calling his hero Juanna, Byronwantonly stresses the sexual equivocal: “I say her because, / The gender stillwas epicene” (58). Even at his most perverse, Spenser is never this coy. Byronis flirting with the reader, something new in literature.Logically, a young man spirited into a harem, like a fox in a henhouse, shouldsoon profit from his access to, as Byron puts it, “a thousand bosoms there /Beating for love” (26). But this is a Romantic and not a Renaissance poem, andin a Romantic poem, as should now be clear, virility is granted no privileges.Juan becomes the object of desire not because he is male but because he isthought female. The harem women fight over who is to sleep with Juanna, and morethan sleep is on their minds: “Lolah’s eyes sparkled at the proposition” (82).Gulbeyaz is included in this steamy stuff. The sultan is “always so polite” asto announce his conjugal visits in advance, “especially at night.” Since theharem is marked by “the absence of all men,” the sultan would presumably not besurprised to find Gulbeyaz in bed with her own women (V.146; VI.32) Don Juan’slesbian innuendos frustrate conventional sexual expectation. How does one defeatthe virility of a man at happy liberty in a harem? The Romantic poem, withcross-sexual virtuosity, blithely replies: why, by turning him into atransvestite and making him the object of lesbian lust!The rest of Don Juan is a series of sexcapades across Asia and Europe. Theunfinished poem ends in female transvestism, a scene probably inspired by TheMonk: Juan’s bedchamber is invaded by a ghostly, hooded friar, whom the closingwords reveal to be a “voluptuous” woman. The best things in Don Juan take placein the Near East, which Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt in 1798 had made asubject of European interest. Knight says “Byron is saturated in orientalsympathies.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note5a] Byron’s Orient, like Shakespeare’s,is an emotionally expansive realm liquefying European sexual personae. Gendersproliferate: Byron calls eunuchs and castrati “the third sex.” We cannotcomprehend the mysteries of love, he says, until we imitate “wise Tiresias” andsample “the several sexes.” Don Juan’s teeming eunuchs—the sultan’s eunuch trainis “a quarter of a mile” long—are extreme versions of its androgynous hero.Transvestite Juan subject to Gulbeyaz is like a castrate priest of Cybele. TheByronic Orient is matriarchal. Don Juan’s seraglio, a “labyrinth of females,” isa drowsy Spenserian bower, the womb-tomb of the male will. As in Antony andCleopatra, the Orient also stands for liberated imagination. It is the anarchicunconscious, a dream-world of unstable sex and identity where objects cannothold their Apollonian shape.Don Juan’s free and easy style is difficult to analyze. Style reflects poet.Spengler says western history demands “contrapuntally strong accents—wars or bigpersonalities—at the decisive points.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note6a] The hugeinfluence of Byron’s personality on the nineteenth century is still incompletelyassessed. His early poems of brooding defiance, like Cain and Manfred, conformto the popular image of Byronism, but Don Juan actually captures the poet’sessential spirit. Don Juan is emotionally various and comprehensive. Bloom says,“The last word in a discussion of Don Juan ought not to be ‘irony’ but‘mobility’, one of Byron’s favorite terms.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note7a] Byrondefined mobility as “an excessive susceptibility of immediate impressions.” Themobile male is receptive and half-feminine. I myself hit upon “mobility” todescribe the psychic volatility of Shakespeare’s boys and women, whom his playsclass with lovers, lunatics, and poets. The many moods of Don Juan’s omniscientnarrator make him a Mercurius of multiple personae. The poem explores theemotional tonalities available to a poetic voice speaking for itself and notthrough projected characters. It is analogous to Chopin’s development of thelyric potential of the piano. In Don Juan Byron takes himself for subject nearlyas forthrightly as Wordsworth does in The Prelude.Byron’s dedication to Don Juan attacks Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey for “anarrowness … which makes me wish you’d change your lakes for ocean.” A lake isenclosed and trapped by the conventional and known. No one point of view can dojustice to ocean, vast and metamorphic. Byronic energy overflows Wordsworthiandecorum. Impatiently, Byron overlooks the sexual ambivalences in Wordsworth anddaemonic Coleridge. He charges them with parochialism, with damming up thewaters of emotion in stagnant spiritual ponds. The English are traditionally aseafaring people. Their location on an island amidst a turbulent northern oceancontributed to the outpouring poetic vitality of the English Renaissance. By theearly nineteenth century, the psychic fluidity of Shakespeare’s England was longgone. Like Shelley, Byron, the most mobile of poets, fled the resentments of aclosed society. The English had become emotionally and sexually landlocked.Frazer links ancient Egypt’s stability and conservatism to its desert geography.Agriculture’s “monotonous routine” gives the farmer “a settled phlegmatic habitof mind very different from the mobility, the alertness, the pliability ofcharacter which the hazards and uncertainties of commerce and the sea foster inthe merchant and the sailor,” with their “mercurial spirit.”8[ch25_notes.html#ch13note8a] In Don Juan, Byron takes English imagination backto sea. As Juan is tossed and turned by adventure, the narrator’s shifting voicerecreates the ceaseless sea change of sex and emotion.Like Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, which made Byron famous, Don Juan is structuredby the archetypal journey theme. But Don Juan’s journeying has speed. AlvinKernan speaks of an “onward rush” in the poem, “a vital forceful onwardmovement.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note9a] From locomotive to jet plane, speed hastransformed modern life. The Renaissance reeled from its sudden expansion ofspace, as the known world doubled and tripled. Speed is western domination ofspace, a linear track of the aggressive will. Modern speed alters perception. Aslate as 1910, E. M. Forster’s heroine in Howards End resists the new speed ofthe motorcar, which makes her lose “all sense of space.” Mr. Wilcox sings out,“There’s a pretty church—oh, you aren’t sharp enough.” Margaret’s premodern eyemoves sluggishly: “She looked at the scenery. It heaved and merged likeporridge. Presently it congealed. They had arrived.”10[ch25_notes.html#ch13note10a] Speed melts the object-world without remaking it.Revolutionary Byron senses an imminent change in the nature of space, which hedid not live to see. Don Juan marks the first appearance in art of modern speed.Critics sometimes speak of the “swiftness” of Shelley’s poetry. But Shelley’smovement is upward. He seeks rhapsodic exaltation (exaltare means “to lift up”).Byron is never exalted. His movement is secular and vehicular. Byron’s space wascreated by the Renaissance Age of Discovery and measured by the Enlightenment.Speaking of Milton, Don Cameron Allen says Judeo-Christianity urges man “toabandon the horizontal movement of human history for the vertical motion of thespiritual life.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note11a] Shelley is spiritualverticality, Byron earthly horizontality. Shelley is always subvertinghorizontals: the Witch of Atlas’ boat defies gravity and sails upstream, or theprocession of “The Triumph of Time” shows life as a leaden line of slaves.Shelley’s objects, as we shall see, are weightless and porous, penetrated byvision. Byron’s concrete objects are firmly fixed in space and time. Shelley’simagination moves, but what moves in Byron is the body. Byron is a Greekathlete, challenging and surpassing. Objects are his counters and steppingstones.Shelley’s and Byron’s speed are energized by different principles ofsex-transcendance. Don Juan’s speed is a skimming, like Raphael’s Galatea flyingin her chariot across the sea. But Galatea is drawn by porpoises. Byron’s speedis self-motivating. All self-motivating speed is hermaphroditic—in angels,Vergil’s Camilla, or Giambologna’s Mercury. Pope’s Camilla “skims along theMain” (An Essay on Criticism, 373). Byron actually compares the dancing Don Juanto Vergil’s Amazon: “Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm’d the ground” (XIV.39).Don Juan the character and Don Juan the poem are world-skimmers. The skimming isin both style and content. Byron’s poetry is not “finished,” that is, finelycrafted and polished. Sir Walter Scott saw in Byron “the careless and negligentease of a man of quality.” Calling him “slovenly, slipshod,” Matthew Arnoldrebuked Byron for “negligence” and “want of art, in his workmanship as apoet.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note12a] But this slapdash freedom gives Byron hisrelentless forward propulsion. Since the lines are not crisply formed, each tipsinto the next with breathless haste. Shakespeare’s spilling lines are weightier,his diction craggier. I said vision in Coleridge and Poe often overpowerslanguage, leaving it rude or weak: words run hot and cold, gorgeous splotchesfollowed by shabby scrabble. But Byron’s poetry has evenness of texture, aliquid fluency. Byron greatly admired the Augustan poets, but though hisaristocratic satire is Augustan, his style is not. There is no braking midlinecaesura, nor is there Pope’s massy orotundity. Byron cultivates a sensation oflinearity. His verse is like a clear, rapid stream. Byron’s objects have afriendly exactitude. His moods and objects are tumbled like smooth pebbles inthe stream of his poetry. Love and hate, male and female, lobster salad andchampagne: this is Byron’s object-world in genial rolling flux. All cometogether in his poetry to make us feel we are skimming a surface.Poetry began as music, and music began as dance. Shelley’s movements are likethose of classical ballet, which takes place in abstract space. Balletideologically defies gravity. Great male dancers are applauded for their abilityto hover at the crest of their leaps, as if momentarily breaking their tie toearth. Female dancers mutilate their feet to remain inhumanly on point, keepingtheir contact with earth to the absolute minimum. The arms extended from thebody, a gesture originating in the Baroque court, suggest wings, contempt forthe earth’s surface. Ballet is the body rising. Ballet is ceremonial andhieratic. Its disdain for the commonplace material world is the source of itsauthority and glamour. Ballet is Apollonian. Martha Graham invented or ratherreinvented chthonian dance. Modern dance is primitivistic and pelvic. It slapsbare feet on mother earth and contracts with her spasms. The dance of Byron’spoetry is neither Apollonian nor chthonian. Byron is attuned neither to sky norto earth’s bowels. He skims earth’s surface, midway between realms. Don Juan’sByronic style is found in only one dancer: Fred Astaire. Astaire’s suppledancing is a silvery gliding along hard polished surfaces. There is no balleticaspiration in Astaire. He is the here and now, a sophisticate moving incosmopolitan space. Even when springing up on chairs or climbing the walls,Astaire is exploring the dimensions of our common life. Rudolf Nureyev is ahaughty Lucifer shut out from heaven, which he tries to reach in angry leaps.Nureyev is early Byron, tense and defiant. Astaire (and his admirer, MikhailBaryshnikov) is late Byron. Astaire is a suave reed bending to the wind. He hasByron’s “ease,” the well-bred manners and gentle smiling irony. Astaire is aselegantly elongated as Giambologna’s Mercury. With his smooth head and slimbody, he is ageless and androgynous. He is a gracious host or guide, likeMilton’s Raphael, “the sociable Spirit” or “affable Arch-angel.” Astaire’s fluidgrace is Byron’s mobility, skimming across the world.Byron knew both his speed and his space. His dedication to Don Juan proclaims torival poets that, “wandering with pedestrian Muses,” he will not contend withthem “on the winged steed.” He is not Nureyev, making Pegasus-like skywardleaps, but Astaire, spiralling across the earth’s dance floor with merry carnalMuses (Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth). An eternal “wandering” orsurface-skimming: like all picaresque works, Byron’s travel poems have nonecessary ending and could go on and on. I call Don Juan’s lightness andquickness breeziness. A connection to Camilla: Jackson Knight says the idea of afleet figure running atop the grain stalks may have originated in Volscianbelief in “the presence of some spirit of the corn.”13[ch25_notes.html#ch13note13a] So the meadows’ wavelike motion is the wind’sinvisible steps. The breeziness of Don Juan is the freshness of a spring breeze,a new spirit entering and aerating history. The breeze emanating fromByron—literally, his emanation—is the spirit of youth, which was to haveenormous impact upon European and American culture. Rousseau invented the moderncult of childhood; Goethe popularized Rousseau’s moody adolescent. But Byroncreated the glamourous sexy youth of brash, defiant energy, the new embodied ina charismatic sexual persona. Hence Byron senses the dawn of the age of speed.Youth is swiftness in emotionally transient form. Transience, from the Latintranseo, contains the ideas both of travel and of the short-lived. Byron,portrayed by Goethe as the androgynous, self-thwarted Euphorion, died in 1824.The first passenger locomotive appeared in 1825. Byron’s spirit seems to havetransmigrated into the engine of speed.Surveys show that two advertising words rivet our attention: “free” and “new.”We still live in the age of Romanticism. When novelty is worshipped, nothing canlast. Byronic youth-culture flourishes in rock music, the ubiquitous Americanart form. Don Juan’s emotional and poetic style is replicated in a classicAmerican experience: driving flat-out on a highway, radio blaring. Driving isthe American sublime, for which there is no perfect parallel in Europe. Tenmiles outside any American city, the frontier is wide open. Our long, straightsuperhighways crisscross vast space. Mercury and Camilla’s self-motivatingspeed: the modern automobile, plentifully panelled with glass, is so quick,smooth, and discreet, it seems an extension of the body. To traverse or skim theAmerican landscape in such a vehicle is to feel the speed and aerated space ofDon Juan. Rock music pulsing on the radio is the car’s heartbeat. European radiostations are few and mostly state-controlled. But American radio-bands teem withmusic and voices, like the many moods of Byron’s poem. Driving through upstateNew York, horizontally slashed by six hours of straight-as-the-crow-fliesThruway, one hears music from Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, as distant asItaly is from England. Twirling the radio dial while travelling the open road,the American driver flies along on a continuous surface of music, with a sublimesense of huge space surveyed and subsumed.Rock music is normally a darkly daemonic mode. The Rolling Stones, the greatestrock band, are heirs of stormy Coleridge. But rock has an Apollonian daylightstyle as well, a combination of sun and speed: the Beach Boys. Don Juan and theBeach Boys combine youth, androgyny, aeration, and speed. Lillian Roxon callsthe Beach Boys’ first album “a celebration of airiness and speed, speed on thewater or the road.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note14a] The romance of motionsurvives in the Beach Boys’ soaring harmonies and chugging sound, like thechuff-chuff-chuff of a locomotive or steamboat. The Beach Boys made theCalifornia surfer a new American archetype, like the cowboy. Surfing, of course,is skimming in its purest form.The Beach Boys use a falsetto lead voice set against a boyish chorale; theirsound is effeminate and yet enthusiastically heterosexual, as in the immortal“California Girls.” We find the same odd combination in Byron. Byron may havebeen partly or even primarily homosexual, but his poetry affects a distinctiveeroticism of effeminate heterosexuality. The Beach Boys’ seraphic boy voicegives an unexpected beauty and religiosity to their trivial high-school themes.The tone is Byronic: sympathy and satire, without cynicism. In their exuberance,hedonism, and mannered irrelevance, the Beach Boys epitomize the self-sustainingand annoyingly self-congratulatory modern youth culture that Byron began. TheAmerican teenager in a souped-up car bursts the confines of adult space.Why did Byron’s poetry turn to skimming? Bernard Blackstone remarks, “We knowhow much Byron objected to seeing his wife eating, and while this may havesomething to do with his own horror of obesity and recollections of his mother’sgormandising, there were probably moments at which Byron saw himself as anhomunculus between the steady munch, munch of Annabella’s upper and lowerjaws.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note15a] Byron had a weight problem and struggledto keep thin, even by starving himself. Fat is femaleness, nature’s abundance,symbolized in the bulging Venus of Willendorf. Femaleness, I argued, isprimitive and archaic, while femininity is social and aesthetic. Byron courtsfemininity but flees femaleness. His fear of fat is his fear of engorgement bymother and wife. Woman gets under his skin. Skimming is keeping the fat off, insoup or milk. Don Juan’s skimming is a defense mechanism, a compromise betweenearth’s primitive chthonianism and sky’s repressive Apollonianism. Byron keepsmoving, reclaiming space from mother nature. Byron’s Sardanapalus eliminates andsupplants Cleopatra because Byron fears the femme fatale and female stasis. Evenfierce Gulbeyaz is trapped in a male world, the sultan’s prisoner.Byron loved water and was so expert a swimmer that he wondered if he had been amerman in a previous life. He chose a mermaid for his carriage crest. Is themermaid androgynous Byron—or archetypal woman closed to penetration? Swimmingwas club-footed Byron’s freest motion. One of his feats was swimming theHellespont: Byron honored liquidity but sought to dominate it, athletically. Asmuch as Wordsworth, he wanted nature without chthonian danger. The clarity ofByron’s late style is a denial of the murk of woman and water. Female fluids areopaque, resistant; fat, the wateriest part of our body, is mother nature’s gripon the human will. Like Blake, Byron refuses to yield to Jehovah or Cybele.“Run, run, run,” say a dozen classic rock songs. To grow, a plant must put downroots. So keep young and die. Byron’s restless animal motion defeats his femalevegetable flesh. Don Juan does not stop because Byron cannot stop.A contemporary spoke of Byron’s “magical influence” on people. Mary Shelley saidof him, “There was something enchanting in his manner, his voice, his smile—afascination in them.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note16a] Byron had pure charisma, apower of personality divorced from the conceptual or moral. Charisma iselectromagnetism, a scintillating fusion of masculine and feminine. LadyBlessington said Byron’s “voice and accent are peculiarly agreeable, buteffeminate.” His friend Moore saw “a feminine cast of character” in “hiscaprices, fits of weeping, sudden affections and dislikes.”17[ch25_notes.html#ch13note17a] Byron belongs to the category of androgyne Iinvented for Michelangelo’s Giuliano de’ Medici: Epicoene, or the man of beauty,an athlete of alabaster skin. Jane Porter found Byron’s complexion “softlybrilliant,” with a “moonlight paleness.” Lady Blessington called his face“peculiarly pale,” set off by curling hair of “very dark brown”: “He uses a gooddeal of oil in it, which makes it look still darker.”18[ch25_notes.html#ch13note18a] White skin, dark oiled hair: Elvis Presley. Inhomage to singer Roy Orbison, Presley dyed his brown-blonde hair black andcontinued to do so to the end, despite friends’ urging to let the natural colorreturn. Presley, a myth-maker, understood the essence of his archetypal beauty.Image [../images/f0360-01.jpg]34. Thomas Phillips, Lord Byron, 1814.Image [../images/f0361-01.jpg]35. Elvis Presley in the film Speedway, 1968.Byron and Elvis Presley look alike, especially in strong-nosed Greek profile(figs. 34 [ch13.html#ch13fig34] and 35 [ch13.html#ch13fig35]). In Glenarvon, aroman à clef about her affair with Byron, Caroline Lamb says of her heroine’sfirst glimpse of him, “The proud curl of the upper lip expressed haughtiness andbitter contempt.”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note19a] Presley’s sneer was soemblematic that he joked about it. In a 1968 television special, he twitched hismouth and murmured, to audience laughter, “I’ve got something on my lip.” TheRomantic curling lip is aristocratic disdain: Presley is still called “theKing,” testimony to the ritual needs of a democratic populace. As revolutionarysexual personae, Byron and Presley had early and late styles: brooding menace,then urbane magnanimity. Their everyday manners were manly and gentle. Presleyhad a captivating soft-spoken charm. The Byronic hero, says Peter Thorslev, is“invariably courteous toward women.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note20a] Byron andPresley were world-shapers, conduits of titanic force, yet they were deeplyemotional and sentimental in a feminine sense.Both had late Orientalizing periods. Byron, drawn to oriental themes, went offto fight the Turks in the Greek war of independence and died of a mysteriousillness at Missolonghi. A portrait shows him in silk turban and embroideredAlbanian dress. The costume style of Presley’s last decade was nearly Mithraic:jewel-encrusted silk jumpsuits, huge studded belts, rings, chains, sashes,scarves. This resembles Napoleon’s late phase, as in Ingres’ portrait of theemperor enthroned in Byzantine splendor, weighed down in velvet, ermine, andjewels. Napoleon, Byron, and Presley began in simplicity as flaming assertionsof youthful male will, and all three ended as ornate objets de culte. Britishlegend envisions a “westering” of culture: Troy to Rome to London. But there isalso an eastering of culture. We are far from our historical roots inMesopotamia and Asia Minor; yet again and again, collective emotion swellingabout a charismatic European personality instinctively returns him or her to theeast. Elizabeth I also ended as a glittering Byzantine icon.Another parallel: Byron and Presley were renowned for athletic vigor, yet bothsuffered chronic ailments that somehow never marred their glossy complexions orrobust beauty. Both constantly fought off corpulence, Presley losing toward theend. Both died prematurely, Byron at thirty-six, Presley at forty-two. Byron’sautopsy revealed an enlarged heart, degenerated liver and gall bladder, cerebralinflammation, and obliteration of the skull sutures.21[ch25_notes.html#ch13note21a] Presley suffered an enlarged heart and degeneratedcolon and liver. In both cases, tremendous physical energy was oddly fused withinternal disorder, a revolt of the organism. Presley’s drugs were symptom, notcause. Psychogenetically, Byron and Presley practiced the secret art of feminineself-impairment.Discussing Michelangelo’s Giuliano, I noted the statue’s swanlike neck,strangely contrasting with the massive knees and calves. Countess Albrizzi saidof Byron, “His neck, which he was in the habit of keeping uncovered as much asthe usages of society permitted, seemed to have been formed in a mould, and wasvery white.” (Shelley also appeared with “his white throat unfettered.”) Most ofByron’s portraits emphasize the neck. Narcissistically turning his feminineneck, the man of beauty offers his profile for our admiration. The femininemeaning of an exposed neck is plain in Flaubert’s Madame Bovary when Emma flirtswith her future husband by tossing off a liqueur and, head back, licking thebottom of the glass. I find similar provocative body language in Lucretius’Mars, Ingres’ Thetis, Girodet’s Endymion, Kleist’s Achilles, George Eliot’sRosamond, and Tilly Losch as the vain Chinese dancer in The Good Earth (1937).One of the hallmarks of Elvis Presley’s late Orientalizing period was hisarchitectural stiff standing collar, elongating the neck and revealing thethroat in a plunging V to the chest. In his Las Vegas shows, Presleyritualistically draped scarves about his neck and cast them into theaudience—self-distribution as formulaic neck-remembrance. Do this in memory ofme.Where does charisma belong? Where should it stay? Byron was full of politicalideas, which led him to sacrifice his life in the cause of liberty. But he wasan Alcibiades whose glamour was too intense for his own society. England couldnot tolerate Byron’s presence and convulsively expelled him. Perfect narcissismis fascinating and therefore demoralizing. Byron’s narcissism released thearchaic and asocial phenomenon of incest. What if Lord Byron had entered Englishpolitics? We have the precedent of another man of beauty, George Villiers, firstDuke of Buckingham, favorite of James I and Charles I. Wandering through thePalazzo Pitti twenty years ago, I was electrified by an ill-lit, unmarkedportrait of stunning androgynous beauty. It turned out to be Rubens’ painting ofBuckingham. Playing Buckingham in Richard Lester’s The Three Musketeers (1974),Simon Gray is wonderfully made up to resemble Rubens’ portrait. David HarrisWillson says:Buckingham was a seductive young man, with something of the allurements of bothsexes. He was esteemed one of the handsomest men in the whole world. Tall,comely, and beautifully proportioned, he had great physical vigour and skill inbodily sports … The antiquarian and diarist, D’Ewes, recorded: “I saw everythingin him full of delicacy and handsome features, yea, his hands and face seemed tome especially effeminate and curious.”22 [ch25_notes.html#ch13note22a]As the man of beauty, Buckingham combined athleticism with feminine charm. Onceagain we find the contrast of dark hair and fine complexion. The politicalconsequences of Buckingham’s extraordinary beauty were severe and longlasting.Perez Zagorin states:He rose to the meridian of power, there to shine in blazing splendour until theknife of an assassin extinguished his light. … A golden shower of wealth andoffices descended on him. … Buckingham’s domination formed an epoch of criticalimportance in the pre-history of the revolution. It deformed the workings of theKing’s government and the patronage system. It sowed disaffection in the Courtand was a prime cause of enmity on the political scene. It brought the royalregime into hatred and contempt. To the favourite’s ascendancy must be ascribedin no small measure the decline of the crown’s moral authority—an authorityindispensable to government which, once lost, can hardly ever be recovered.With all his sway over affairs, Buckingham had no real policy or extended aims.Unlike his contemporary ministers, Richelieu and Olivares, his predominantpurpose in the use of power was to aggrandize himself and his dependents.23[ch25_notes.html#ch13note23a]Alcibiades helped bring down the Athenian empire. Buckingham hastened England’sregicidal revolution. Excess charisma is dangerous, to self and others.Byron, the Romantic exile, did England a favor. Energy and beauty together areburning, godlike, destructive. Byron created the youth-cult that would sweepElvis Presley to uncomfortable fame. In our affluent commercial culture, thisman of beauty was able to ignore politics and build his empire elsewhere. Aritual function of contemporary popular culture: to parallel and purifygovernment. The modern charismatic personality has access to movies, television,and music, with their enormous reach. Mass media act as a barrier protectingpolitics, which would otherwise be unbalanced by the entrance of men of epochalnarcissistic glamour. Today’s Byronic man of beauty is a Presley who dominatesthe imagination, not a Buckingham who disorders a state."},{"pageContent":"14LIGHT AND HEATShelley and KeatsFathers earn and sons spend. Entrepreneurs in business or art fight their way toidentity, amassing fortunes that they leave to their heirs. The son, having itall, has nothing to press against, except the father. So many sons of famousfathers are alcoholics, drug addicts, dilettantes. The first generation ofRomantic poets forcefully created themselves out of the declining eighteenthcentury. Their personalities were conflicted and contradictory, grand even indisarray. The second generation, beginning on the assumptions of the first, wasbreezier but lacked stamina. Byron, Shelley, and Keats lyricize reality. Lyric,a Greek genre, is based on simple parallelism between nature and emotion. Inantiquity, lyric was supplemented by the other genres, which taken as a wholegive a complete picture of the universe. Lyric cannot stand alone as a genre.Dante, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton subordinated lyric to larger statements.So did Blake and Wordsworth, and so did Coleridge, who turned to philosophy toescape his lyric agonies. Byron, Shelley, and Keats expanded the lyric toextraordinary length. But length did not protect them from the torment implicitin lyric emotion, when unframed by stable social structure. All three fledsouth, as if to recharge lyric at its source. The first Romantic to make lyricsurvive the northern winter was Emily Dickinson—and that was because she stayedput and used Spenser and Blake to confront nature’s sadism. The second Romanticgeneration tried to argue away the daemonism which the first had uncovered insex and nature.Imagination for Shelley is “the principle of synthesis,” uniting “allirreconcilable things.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note1a] Like Coleridge, he extendsthe synthesis of contraries to sexual personae. He is the first Romantic to usethe overt Hermaphrodite positively. In the elegy Adonais (1821), Shelleyportrays Keats as a half-feminine Adonis, treacherously slain. His prefaceattributes Keats’s tubercular death to “the savage criticism” of “Endymion,”Keats’s version of the myth of beautiful youth and moon-goddess. “These wretchedmen” of the Quarterly Review had “the most violent effect on his susceptiblemind.” Later rave reviews “were ineffectual to heal the wound thus wantonlyinflicted.” Adonis’ goring by the boar’s tusk becomes a poet’s goring by hostilecritics. The poet as beautiful boy ritually slain by society recalls ThomasChatterton, mentioned in Adonais. Chatterton, a frustrated poet who killedhimself at seventeen in 1770, became a Romantic archetype of tragic youth.Shelley’s unscrupulous critics are like Wordsworth’s sneering “selfish men.”Society is controlled by virile males who abuse the feminine poet. Shelley says“the poisoned shaft” of “their insults and their slanders” is fatal when landingon a heart “like Keats’s composed of more penetrable stuff.” The arrow is atusk, the heart a groin. Susceptible Keats is penetrable as a woman. Shelley isremembering Shakespeare’s sadomasochistic eroticism in Venus and Adonis:“Nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine / Sheathed unaware the tusk in his softgroin” (115–16). Critics, of course, are unloving swine.For Shelley and all Romantics except Blake, the poet is a passive sufferer.Shelley’s major use of the theme is in Prometheus Unbound, where youthfulPrometheus says “Pain is my element” (1.477). The Promethean poet steals thedivine fire of imagination, but in Romantic terms, his punishment is for anyattempt at assertive action. The poem opens on the sadomasochistic spectacle ofPrometheus helplessly pinned down, pierced by ice spears and the beak of amarauding bird. All male artists have Keats’s penetrable body and heart. LikeBlake’s God Creating Adam, Prometheus Unbound is male sex war. The oppressor isvirile and therefore unjust. Shelley revises classical myth and Paradise Lost bydriving Jupiter from heaven. As “the supreme Tyrant” sinks, his power drainsaway. The vengeful poet castrates in turn.Shelley’s “Ozymandias” charts another male fall. Pharaoh, probably Rameses II,noisily pumps himself up but is defeated by time. Again, tyranny and virility“sneer.” The artist, a nobody, sees all. Ozymandias’ “shattered visage” is thewestern male persona, riven with cracks. The poem is an iconoclasm, a breakingof the image. Patient, persistent nature topples the male idol of sex andpolitics. Political power is built on sand, but art lasts. How true of RamesesII: we remember him only through Abu Simbel, the Book of Exodus, and The TenCommandments, where he is brilliantly played by Yul Brynner. Nature’s revenge:today Rameses II makes the news as a tiny mummy infested by parasites andshipped air freight to Paris for gas treatment. In Shelley’s sonnet, gas isPharaoh’s problem.The two main figures of The Witch of Atlas (1820) are androgynes. The witch isborn fully potent in a “chamber of gray rock.” Like Athena, she has nochildhood; like Circe, she is a metamorphosist and daughter of the Sun. Thewitch represents the magic of art. Her birthplace, “the enwombéd rocks,” areWordsworth’s chthonian caverns of the mind. She is a secretion, anearth-thought. Shelley echoes “Kubla Khan,” turning Coleridge’s ostracized poetinto a Spenserian femme fatale. But there is no Spenserian sex. The witch is “asexless bee” (Pindar’s Delphic oracle), “a lovely lady garmented in light.” Oneof Shelley’s favorite strategies is to use Apollonian light to temper or sweetenchthonian mysteries. In its dynamics of art-making, The Witch of Atlas deniesthat creation must come out of destruction.The clairvoyant witch enters human consciousness, watching the movements ofsocial and erotic life. “Her own thoughts were each a minister”: she has aninner male court. Self-populated, she needs no mate or friend. She shows emotiononly once, when she weeps at the futility of cultivating sea-nymphs ortree-spirits, since they are mortal and she is not. Leaving her mountainsolitude for some sightseeing, the witch invents a mechanical companion to powerher spirit-boat. Out of “fire and snow” she makes Hermaphroditus, “a sexlessthing” with the “grace” of both genders. It has “gentleness and strength,” aswelling bosom and angel’s wings. Its fire and snow belong to Spenser’s FalseFlorimell, a male spirit skilled in female impersonation. The Hermaphroditebreaks natural law by propelling the boat upstream. As an art work, itpersonifies its own text, a poem-within-a-poem.The sexless witch models her creature on herself. I see the Hermaphrodite as aself-portrait, an extrapolation of her sexual duality. Its fabrication is aRomantic materialization of the double, like those in Wordsworth’s Tintern Abbeyand Byron’s Manfred. In Wordsworth, the double is silent but alert. In Byron,the double hesitates but finally speaks. In Shelley, the double is mute and evenautistic. It lies with “unawakened eyes” in the boat, “busy dreams” playing overits face. It smiles, cries, sighs, murmurs to itself. Arguing against Knight’sview that the Hermaphrodite is “the evolutionary or transcendental goal ofmankind,” Bloom rightly says it is “only a robot.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note2a]The Hermaphrodite is comatose, catatonic. Like Goethe’s Homunculus, it is theandrogyne as nineteenth-century manufactured object.I call this type of torpid, glacial androgyne the android, a futuristic entity.The classic modern android was the high-fashion model of the Fifties toSeventies, with her haughty masklike face. Anthony Burgess reports a friend’srendezvous with “the ideal mannequin, all legs and no breasts”: “It was likegoing to bed with a bicycle.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note3a] David Bowie used themannequin style in his transvestite period, when his skull-like face seemedcoldly artificial. An android female, reviled by D. H. Lawrence, appeared in theTwenties. Parker Tyler calls studio-era stars like Garbo “somnambules.”4[ch25_notes.html#ch14note4a] I class as affectless movie zombies Gene Tierney inLeave Her to Heaven (1945), Joan Greenwood in The Importance of Being Earnest(1952), Kim Novak in Vertigo (1958), and Catherine Deneuve in Repulsion (1965)and Belle de Jour (1966). Emotional lifelessness is psychological abstraction, amasculine impersonality. Other somnambulistic androids are Wilde’s entranced,robotlike Salomé and Lawrence’s slow-moving, “scarcely conscious” HermioneRoddice, with her “drugged” face.5 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note5a]The hermaphroditic manufactured object predates the Industrial Revolution.Vergil calls the Trojan Horse a “womb” filled with soldiers, a “fatal machinepregnant with arms.” Built with the “divine art” of androgynous Athena, theTrojan Horse is hermaphroditic because of its soulless fecundity: artificialinsemination breeds monstrous mechanical parturition (Aen. II.20, 52, 237–38,15). Spenser’s daemonic False Florimell is an android, as is the bust ofNefertiti, who shares her one bad eye with David Bowie. I spoke of Nefertiti’sadvanced cerebral development and surgically truncated shoulders. We are stilluntangling the legal and moral problems caused by the invention of a new sex,the transsexual, produced by chemical and surgical manipulation of the body. Thetranssexual is a technological androgyne whom we are happy to call “she” out ofthe courtesy owed to all inspired makers of fiction. Close to transsexual is myfavorite technological androgyne, Luciana Avedon, formerly the PrincessPignatelli, who radically resculpted face and body in her quest for beauty.Avedon’s first book begins:A few times every century, a great natural beauty is born. I am not one of them.But what nature skipped, I supplied—-so much so that sometimes I cannot rememberwhat is real and what is fake. More important, neither can anyone else.6[ch25_notes.html#ch14note6a]The android is nether male nor female because it is a machine made of syntheticmaterials. In a wonderful commercial for Camay soap, the radiantly amiableLuciana Avedon turned her surgically altered face to the camera and addressedthe viewer in a slow robot voice that stretched the phrase “coconut-enrichedlather” to impossible hypnotic length. Transsexual Renée Richards shows the sameodd combination of facial flat affect with elongated somnambulistic speech, amechanical drone.Insofar as it is an android, therefore, Shelley’s Hermaphrodite cannot beregarded as a model for human life. It is one of the most solipsistic andemotionally dissociated beings in Romantic poetry. The Hermaphrodite descendsfrom Talus, Spenser’s “iron man” who does Artegall’s bidding. Talus isoriginally the servant of immortal Astraea, who rears Artegall in a cave lookingforward to the cave of the Witch of Atlas. Shelley’s poem may be a reply to hiswife’s Frankenstein, published two years earlier. The Hermaphrodite is hisversion of an experimental automaton, an Apollonian angel of emotionaldetachment and aesthetic perfection. Some competition or debate was clearlygoing on between the Shelleys, for in her “Note on the Witch of Atlas,” Maryrecalls urging her husband to “increase his popularity by adopting subjects thatwould more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract anddreamy spirit of the Witch of Atlas,” which lacks “human interest and passion.”Shelley counters with six stanzas defending the “visionary” quality of hispoetry. The merely human is not his concern. Romantics aim higher and lower.Shelley wrote The Witch of Atlas near Pisa in August 1820. Three months later,Mary Shelley and Claire Clairmont met Emilia Viviani, the nineteen-year-olddaughter of the governor of Pisa, who was packing her off into an arrangedmarriage. Emilia was the inspiration for Epipsychidion, which Shelley began inJanuary 1821. My theory is that from the moment he laid eyes on her, Shelley sawEmilia Viviani as a stunning materialization of the Hermaphrodite of hisjust-completed Witch of Atlas. In the first poem, the Hermaphrodite is seenthrough an artist-intermediary, the witch. In the second, the poet himselfconfronts the Hermaphrodite. Epipsychidion, a major poem, is ill-understood. Itattempts to convert Romanticism, a daemonic and chthonian mode, into theApollonian. It combines androgyny with incest, already present in the firstwords of The Witch of Atlas, which describe the incestuous birth of twins.Epipsychidion has been completely misread as a polemical defense of adultery.The friendship between the Shelleys and Emilia Viviani was short but intense.Early commentators speculated endlessly on Mary Shelley’s attitude toward herhusband’s intimacy with Emilia. In her roman à clef, Lodore (1835), Mary depictsthe relation as platonic, which some think a whitewash. I feel, however, thatthe platonic connection is perfectly clear in Epipsychidion and that it iscentral to interpretation of the poem. Epipsychidion imagines a new kind ofrelationship, eroticized but nongenital, where both partners are of waveringgender.The first line of Epipsychidion addresses Emilia as “Spirit” and “Sister,” thepoem’s governing ideas. “Sister-spirit,” one of my favorite Romantic phrases,comes from cancelled stanzas. The poet longs to be Emilia’s twin, born of onemother. Not only is Emilia to be Shelley’s sister, but his wife is to be hersister (45–48). In other words, Shelley makes his own wife his sister. For theRomantic poet, every relation contracts to family romance. Emilia’s letters tothe Shelleys (theirs to her were apparently destroyed) show familial languagewas explicit among them. Emilia calls Shelley her brother and Mary her sister.Shelley’s longing for twinship is a desire for genetic identity within aheterosexual coupling. In the essay On Love, Shelley says something in us frombirth “thirsts after its likeness.” As Emilia’s twin, the poet would be unitedwith his likeness and escape human anxieties of separation and incompletion.Incest’s asociality is brilliantly embodied in his idea of twins whoseincestuous relation precedes their social identities. Incest is older than andprior to civilization. The poet leaps backward to the dawn of time.That Shelley may be thinking of incestuous intercourse between twins in the wombcannot be dismissed, since it occurs in The Faene Queene. The twin giantsArgante and Ollyphant, themselves the product of incest, mingle “in fleshlylust” before birth and emerge clasped in the “monstrous” act (III.vii.48). TheRenaissance poet condemns what the Romantic poet celebrates. Prenatal sex is anold idea: Plutarch reports Isis and Osiris copulated in the womb. Mind, notbody, is the issue in Epipsychidion. Shelley seeks a form of knowledge prior tothe rational. He and his twin make a joint expedition to the origins of humanconsciousness.Shelley hails Emilia as “Seraph of Heaven,” “Veiled Glory,” “Spouse! Sister!Angel!” The seraphic imagery of Epipsychidion is unparalleled in Englishliterature. Like Wordsworth, Shelley seraphicizes the beloved woman, giving hera numinous glamour. Flooded by Apollonian light, Emilia is desexualized anddematerialized. She becomes a shimmering presence of unfixed gender. In anomitted fragment, Shelley records different views of Emilia. Some call her afamiliar, some a woman. Others “swear you’re a Hermaphrodite,” “that sweetmarble monster of both sexes.” So Emilia’s gender and identity were a matter ofpublic disupute in Pisa. A Roman Hermaphrodite statue also appears in Spenser’scancelled “Hermaphrodite stanzas.” Did Shelley write his own Hermaphroditestanza in order to cancel it, in homage to Spenser? Or is a parallel aestheticsimply at work? Epipsychidion and The Faerie Queene follow Apollonian laws. TheHermaphrodite statue, with its anatomic blatancies, is too gravity-bound for theworld of Apollonian radiance. The poetic energy of Epipsychidion is in theweightless verticals of spiritual ascent.Shelley’s second draft for the preface contains a peculiar fantasy.Epipsychidion, it claims, was found in the personal effects of “a youngEnglishman, who died on his passage from Leghorn to the Levant.” He wasaccompanied by “a lady who might have been supposed to be his wife” and by “aneffeminate looking youth,” who turned out to be a woman in disguise. He hadbought a Greek island with a Saracenic castle, where he intended to “dedicatethe remainder of his life to undisturbed intercourse with his companions.”Epipsychidion clearly emerged from a matrix of perverse fantasy. Shelley’spreface is Byronic: the Englishman is travelling to the east; the effeminateyouth is like Byron’s pageboy Kaled, the transvestite woman who dies of grief atLara’s death. Shelley seems to be imagining himself accompanied by his wife andby Emilia Viviani in boy’s clothing. Byron must have told his friends theShelleys about his erotic adventures with a girl dressed as a boy. But Shelleyrevises Byron’s caprice into a menage a trois, as exotic as a Shakespeareanacting company on tour. What is the wife’s relation to the girl-boy—tolerance orindependent erotic interest? Because of Epipsychidion’s incest theme, it ispossible that the lady “who might have been supposed to be his wife” mightinstead be the Englishman’s sister, with whom he is romantically involved.In another fragment Shelley tells Emilia: “If any should be curious to discover/ Whether to you I am a friend or lover, / Let them read Shakespeare’s sonnets,taking thence / A whetstone for their dull intelligence.” This is a directchallenge to the reader. Shelley is saying we must guess whether Emilia is theItalian Dark Lady of the sonnets—or the beautiful boy. He doubts “thepresumptuous pedagogues of Earth” can “tell the riddle offered here.” The riddleEmilia is like Goethe’s “enigma,” the transvestite Mignon. Androgynous Emilialooks backward to transvestite Rosalind, with her riddling circle magic, andforward to Balzac’s ambiguous Seraphita. Epipsychidion is an Apollonian cinemawhere Shelley invents image after image to answer the riddle of Emilia’sidentity.Shelley declares Emilia the embodiment of a dazzling figure he has dreamed ofsince youth. This “veiled Divinity” recalls Spenser’s veiled hermaphroditeVenus. Like Coleridge’s Christabel, Epipsychidion is a sexual apocalyse in whichthe hermaphrodite god is seen face to face. Critics agree that Shelley’slong-sought image is the “epipsyche” of the title, a word translated as “a soulwithin the soul.” Carlos Baker speaks of Shelley’s “psyche-epipsyche strategy”:“The mind (psyche) imaginatively creates or envisions what it does not have(epipsyche), and then seeks to possess epipsyche, to move towards it as agoal.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note7a] This excellent formulation would beaccurate about Blake but not about Shelley. The femininity of Shelley’sepipsyche is not what his psyche does not have, since he is alreadyhalf-feminine—shown by the wealth of details in Epipsychidion stressing hispassivity. The epipsyche may be an aspect of self projected and pursued. But itis not a repressed feminine component, since in Romanticism after Blake,femininity is never repressed. If the Romantics repress anything, it ismasculinity. I revise Baker’s statement: Shelley’s feminine psyche pursues whatit does not have—masculinity, which it embodies in a female epipsyche. Pursuerand pursued are hermaphrodites.Shelley enjoyed subordination to female power. He told Elizabeth Hitchener, “Youare as my better genius.” A letter to his future wife declares: “Your thoughtsalone can waken mine to energy. … My understanding becomes undisciplined withoutyou.” This persona of ritual dependency is a characteristic Romantic mask. JohnStuart Mill similarly idolized Harriet Taylor, whom he calls a genius and hisintellectual superior, source of those achievements for which the worldmistakenly honors him alone. Gertrude Himmelfarb, among others, shows this to bea patent falsification.8 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note8a] However, Mill’s imaginingHarriet as superior may genuinely have energized him. Creativity flows from anarchaic repositioning of sexual personae. In some way, Harriet as Diotima ordominatrix stilled guilt. Oddly, the one person Mill compares Harriet to in hisautobiography is Shelley himself—only to find Shelley wanting. Harriet resembledShelley “in thought and intellect” and everything else, but Shelley “was but achild compared with what she ultimately became.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note9a]Alas, the unremarkable Harriet cannot survive so cruel a test.Shelley wears his persona of elected passivity throughout Epipsychidion. He is“a dizzy moth” seeking “a radiant death” in the flame of his angelicdream-image. The poem’s midsection chronicles his erotic history, as he soughtthe image “in many mortal forms.” The three major women in his life, Claire,Mary, and Emilia, become comet, moon, and sun, exerting their power upon him,“this passive Earth.” Shelley is making an astrological and therefore paganrevision of Dante’s tutelage by the Madonna, St. Lucy, and Beatrice. He repeatsin four different ways Coleridge’s metaphor of the poet as feminine sea playedupon by larger forces. Shelley’s first encounter with Emilia combines Dante andSpenser: “Into the obscure Forest” came his “Vision,” who “flashed from hermotion splendour like the Morn’s.” Dante’s pilgrim meets Spenser’s Belphoebe,the glittering Apollonian huntress. Emilia, an “Incarnation of the Sun,” is“penetrating me with living light.” The poet is “a hunted deer,” pierced by herraylike solar arrows. (Earlier, imagination shoots “many a sun-like arrow”.) SoShelley is the female deer wounded by Belphoebe at her entrance into The FaerieQueene. A few months later, in Adonais, he again describes himself as a “deerstruck by the hunter’s dart.” Emilia is penetrator, Shelley penetrated.Sometimes Emilia is a gentle sister or “poor captive bird,” her real-life phrasefor herself (her father had put her in a convent for her schooling). At othertimes she is imperiously Amazonian: “Thou Wonder, and thou Beauty, and thouTerror!” Echoing the Song of Songs (6:4), Shelley gives woman a masculinemilitancy. In a poem on Leonardo’s Medusa he says, “Its horror and its beautyare divine.” The painting, with its “Gorgonian eyes,” has “the tempestuousloveliness of terror.” Medusa is Apollonian Emilia’s chthonian twin. Beauty andterror together in a person of either sex are prima facie hermaphroditic. We seethem in Coleridge’s longhaired poet, who makes people cry “Beware! Beware!”In Epipsychidion, therefore, a passive poet glorifies a woman who is alternatelyan incestuous twin, a genderless spirit, and an Amazon. The third and finalsection of the poem prophesies their future relationship. The poet’s summons toEmilia is usually dismissed as a sentimental elopement fantasy. But Emilia willbe “a bride” to the poet’s spirit and “a vestal sister” to his body. Vestalmeans virgin: this is a no-sex marriage. Shelley imagines their voyage to anidyllic Greek island with fountains and streams “as clear as elemental diamond,”under “the roof of blue Ionian weather.” I suspect the wording and décorinfluenced Baudelaire’s gorgeous “Invitation to the Voyage,” with its dreamyappeal to the Romantic sister-spirit.Shelley’s Greek imagery establishes his theme of eroticized chastity inexclusively formal terms. Bloom strongly resists scholars’ ascription ofPlatonism to Shelley’s poetry. Platonism is of little use in reading poetry; itshistorical meanings are too broad. However, I substitute the term Apollonian forShelley’s idealizations. He is a Greek visionary of the visible world, with itseye-dominated Apollonian radiance. Homer’s white-armed Nausikaa, Sappho’smaidens, and the Athenian Kritios Boy are in the high Greek style of simplicity,clarity, purity, and beauty. Shelley’s purity would be no less Greek were hisimaginary island off Scotland. He is having “an antenatal dream”: the island’s“calm circumference of bliss” is life in the womb, where the incestuous twinsunite. Epipsychidion’s voyage is into not the future but the past.Shelley and his sister-spirit finally reach an ancient cavern filled with “themoonlight of the expired night.” There they come together:Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,And our veins beat together; and our lipsWith other eloquence than words, eclipseThe soul that burns between them, and the wellsWhich boil under our being’s inmost cells,The fountains of our deepest life, shall beConfused in Passion’s golden purityThe passage continues to a blazing height, from which the poet falls backabruptly. Vision fails him, because the union, the most radical seraphicizationin poetry, veers in an unexpected direction. Social personae recede. Shelley thedramatic character falls silent, while Shelley the choral commentator continuesas long as he can. Words cease, since prenatal incest precedes culture.Shelley describes his union with Emilia in multiple metaphors drawn from theHermaphrodite myths in Plato, Ovid, and Milton. The intermixture of breaths andbinding of bosoms have led many scholars to misread the poem as a defense offree love. Kissing and embracing prove no genital connection, in view of EmiliaViviani’s letters speaking of her ardent desire to kiss and embrace MaryShelley. Something physical is going on in Epipsychidion, but it is not normalsexual intercourse. The boiling wells, fountains, and springs refer to Ovid’sforest pool of the nymph Salmacis, who fuses with the youth Hermaphroditus. InShelley’s version, Emilia’s body disappears into his. Gender is eradicated andbiology defied. Life begins again. Shelley and Emilia are to be reborn as oneperson. Epipsychidion leads to the womb, the body-warmed sac of waters. The poemboils like an alembic on the Delphic tripod. Its cavern is the Witch of Atlas’birth chamber of “enwombèd rocks.” The Witch of Atlas begins where Epipsychidionends. Shelley’s two Hermaphrodite poems make a single continuous movement. LikeColeridge’s pornographic Christabel, Epipsychidion is a superheatedpsychoalchemic experiment, releasing and rebonding sexual energy. InEpipsychidion, an Apollonian poem with a chthonian climax, orgasmic sexuality isvanquished and transcended. Body is consumed in the flames of imagination, whichlight and heat the poem.But Epipsychidion implodes. The search for a new identity based on gender-freeeroticism ends in the extinction of all identity. The unity of incestuoustwinship collapses into nondifferentiation. Incest restores primeval chaos.Shelley sinks into dispiriting density, like the swamp mud of the Great Mother.The poem is reclaimed by the chthonian. Epipsychidion attempts the impossibletask of reconciling regression to the womb with Apollonian seraphicization, aburning away and ascent of the gender-limited body. But the Apollonian angel isby definition anti-chthonian, a flight from the mother-ruled labyrinth of sex,body, and nature. At the moment the poet thinks himself victorious over matter,the earth exerts her malign gravitation and plummets him downward to herembrace. Shelley awakened her power early in the poem when he opened himself tothe womb-state: “Would we two had been twins of the same mother!” Summoned, thearchaic mother appears.Shelley’s parting from Emilia Viviani was not cordial, though there seems tohave been no one provoking incident. Newman Ivey White describes it as a“revulsion” from her, similar to “several other sudden revulsions” in Shelley’shistory.10 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note10a] The poet ended by suppressingEpipsychidion. In a letter just before his death the next year, Shelley said ofhis estrangement from Emilia: “I think one is always in love with something orother; the error … consists in seeking in a mortal image the likeness of what isperhaps eternal.” This is the disease of western love. Shelley’s letterdescribes psychological heliotropism, my term for susceptibility to the glamourof charismatic personality. The person is intensely visualized: inEpipsychidion, Shelley cries, “See where she stands!” The western cinematic eyeis directed, fixed, inflamed. But the person invested with so much hieraticenergy is coldly discarded when he or she proves humanly frail. The idealizinglover surrenders himself to dramatic illusion, the power of persona. I thinkShelley’s disillusionment came when Emilia, then nineteen years old and at thevery borderline of adolescent bloom (“A Metaphor of Spring and Youth andMorning; / A Vision like incarnate April”), suddenly crossed over and lookedlike a woman instead of an androgyne. The first time I read Epipsychidion, Iknew what Emilia Viviani looked like: Hadrian’s Antinous. The poem’s brilliantglamour could only have been inspired by a person of extraordinary androgynousbeauty. Thus it was no surprise when I learned Emilia had “faultlessly regularGreek features.”Shelley’s final preface to Epipsychidion compares it, without explanation, toDante’s Vita Nuova. Bloom rejects this: Shelley’s parallel is “hardly justified”and “does not help us to comprehend anything of value in the poem.”11[ch25_notes.html#ch14note11a] But the allusion to Dante is exactly right:Epipsychidion is Shelley’s Vita Nuova. I argued that Dante’s Beatrice was anarcissistic personality, a girl-boy to whom the obsessed poet rituallysubjected himself. Only Knight seems also to have noticed Beatrice’s “youthfulpresexual perfection.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note12a] Glancing over thefragments and drafts connected with Epipsychidion, we see how easily Shelley’smind moved from the Roman Hermaphrodite statue to a transvestite girl asbeautiful boy to the Vita Nuova, with its charismatic adolescent Beatrice.Epipsychidion and the Vita Nuova are classic texts of western erotic perversity,which gives enormous hierarchic stature to self-enclosed Apollonian personality,a living objet d’art. I think the exclamatory style of Epipsychidion partlycomes from the aggressive force needed to break into the near-autisticconsciousness of this kind of glamourous androgyne, with his or her dreamyapartness. Remember the Witch of Atlas’ Hermaphrodite: all that buzzing andmurmuring, that labial self-love. The girl as beautiful boy is a silverautomaton hearkening to its own inner music. Narcissists receive callers withoutopening the door.Shelley’s revulsion from Emilia Viviani was an aesthetic swerve. It happenedlike this: Emilia’s seraphically transparent flesh suddenly appeared heavy andcoarsely female. I have seen with my own eyes the humiliating changes life workson the personality of high glamour. The luminous complexion turns muddy; theaura vanishes. Glamour is a gift under no one’s control. In women it may peakand ebb with the menstrual cycle. A Shelleyan declension from idealization todisillusion occurs in D. H. Lawrence’s The Rainbow, in Ursula’s infatuation withher teacher, Winifred Inger. It begins in Apollonian radiance and Greekarchetype and ends, like Epipsychidion, in a sad fall into earthliness.“Firm-bodied as Diana,” dressed in a tunic “like a Greek girl’s,” Inger is“proud and free as a man, yet exquisite as a woman.” Ursula thinks: “Ah, thebeauty of the firm, white, cool flesh! Ah, the wonderful firm limbs. … The wholebody was defined, firm and magnificent.” But after the two become intimate,Ursula experiences the Shelleyan revulsion. She feels “a sort of nausea,” “aheavy, clogged sense of deadness.” Inger is “ugly, clayey”: “Her female hipsseemed big and earthy.”13 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note13a] Ursula is evolving fromlesbianism to heterosexuality, continued in the sequel, Women in Love. Ursula’svision of her teacher is like Shelley’s of Emilia Viviani. The Apollonianandrogyne of radiant Greek beauty degenerates into matter without contour. Thepoet moved on and left the shell of his vision behind.Shelley said in a letter, “Incest is, like many other incorrect things, a verypoetical circumstance.” Poetry and incest coexist outside the norm. Romanticincest is a closed internal world. St. Augustine finds the prohibition againstincest rationally justified for “the multiplying of relationships”: “‘Father’and ‘father-in-law’ are the names of two relationships. When, therefore, a manhas one person for his father, another for his father-in-law, friendship extendsitself to a larger number. But Adam in his single person was obliged to holdboth relations to his sons and daughters, for brothers and sisters were unitedin marriage.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note14a] Incest closes society down byregressing to prehistory. In Poe’s clannish, incestuous Ushers, desire shrinksfrom contact with aliens. Incest in antiquity had an aristocratic elitism.Ovid’s Byblis, lusting for her twin brother, argues: “Yet surely gods havemarried their sisters? … But the gods have their own laws.”15[ch25_notes.html#ch14note15a] Byron’s incest with his half-sister (if itoccurred) was self-hierarchizing: the gods have their own laws, and I am a god.Like the Greek Ptolemies in Egypt, kings intermarry to preserve dynastic purity.The Romantic poet marrying his sister founds a new hierarchy. He belongs to aprivileged caste, the visionary or magus. Catullus says the Persian magus mustbe born of the incest of mother and son (90). Magian poetic vision transcendsspace and time by violating social and natural law.Remarkably, Epipsychidion, Romanticism’s most operatic incest-romance, hasnothing to do with a real brother and sister. Shelley perversely imposessisterhood on Emilia Viviani. He materializes it by magian imagination, thenviolates it with incest. Shelley’s fictive brotherhood is emotional and sexualdialogue with one’s double, whose features alter, as in a magic mirror, to thoseof the opposite sex. We saw how Byron changes Shakespeare’s Cleopatra intoSardanapalus’ mirror. The knight whom Spenser’s Britomart sees in the mirror issimultaneously herself and her future husband. The Renaissance double maturesinto the social other, while Romantic doubles often lock and die. This happenswith Byron’s Manfred and Astarte, Poe’s Roderick and Madeline Usher, and Wilde’sDorian Gray and his portrait. It also happens at the climax of Epipsychidion,when the poet and sister-spirit convulse into “one annihilation.” Earlier,Shelley actually calls Emilia “Thou Mirror.” In The Cenci, Shelley’s Count usesa mirror metaphor to curse Beatrice, the daughter whom he forces into incest:may her child be “A hideous likeness of herself, that as / From a distortingmirror, she may see / Her image mixed with what she most abhors, / Smiling uponher from her nursing breast” (IV.i.145–49). Beatrice looks into a living mirrorand sees her monstrous double, stuck to her like a tumor. The nursing baby bornof incest is her daemonic self-portrait, like the picture of Dorian Gray. Itcombines her face with her hated father’s, female mixed with male. Count Cenci,perverter of the paternal, makes his daughter a Medusan Madonna.Knight, who calls Epipsychidion “autoerotic,” declares, “Both homosexuality andincest may be symptoms of a state which approaches self-sufficiency andintegration, and so looks for affection less to an opposite than to areplica.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note16a] Otto Fenichel says the maletransvestite may fantasize that “the masculine element in his nature can haveintercourse with the feminine (i.e. with himself).”17[ch25_notes.html#ch14note17a] Is there a secret connection between Byron’sincest and Don Juan’s transvestism? Freud speaks of masturbatory fantasies wherea person “pictures himself both as the man and as the woman in an imaginedsituation.” He observed a hysterical attack where “the patient pressed her dressto her body with one hand (as the woman) while trying to tear it off with theother (as the man).”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note18a] Romantic incest-romancemakes poetry of this psychodrama. No one has completely explained the romanticfascination with incest. M. H. Abrams traces it to the underground alchemictradition, with its pervasive incest symbols.19 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note19a] Ifeel that most Romantic incest is free of alchemic influence and that it isproduced by the late eighteenth-century crisis in sex roles.One of the great Romantic metaphors, the Aeolian lyre, has a latent sexualambiguity unnoted by major criticism. In “The Correspondent Breeze,” a centralRomantic study, Abrams discusses the Aeolian lyre in erudite detail withouttaking slightest notice of the fact that the male poet identifying with a windharp makes himself feminine toward inspiring power.20[ch25_notes.html#ch14note20a] Shelley says poetry cannot be composed by an actof will: “the mind in creation is as a fading coal, which some invisibleinfluence, like an inconstant wind, awakens to transitory brightness.”21[ch25_notes.html#ch14note21a] The wind rouses the fading coal just as it playsupon the lyre. The poet waits like an odalisque, a Giorgione nude asleep in ameadow. Shelley’s “invisible influence” recalls Blake’s phallic “invisible worm”flying in a storm-wind toward the rose; a flower metaphor in fact appears in thenext sentence. Like Wordsworth, Shelley elevates intuition over “reasoning,”aggressive tool of Adonais’ slanderous Keats-killers. Keats’s friend Haydon usesthe lyre metaphor to describe the poet reciting from “Endymion” to a curt andunresponsive Wordsworth: “It was rather ill-bred to hurt a youth, at such amoment when he actually trembled, like the String of a Lyre, when it has beentouched.”22 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note22a] As with Coleridge and the nightrecital of The Prelude: watch out for Wordsworth one-on-one. RousseauistWordsworth could play by Sade’s rules. No love is lost between artists claimingthe same turf.The sexual conventionalism of so much twentieth-century criticism was especiallydamaging to Romanticism, with its intrinsic perversities. I find Douglas Bush’shostile remarks about Shelley from 1937 more accurate about the poet than muchof the commentary by admirers during the postwar Romantic revival. Bush rejectsShelley’s “sentimentality”: “His heroes and martyrs are all alike, allphysically weak and spiritually lonely, pale youths who perish, or are ready toperish, unupbraiding. They are all variations on the portrait of himself as aneffeminate romantic idealist.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note23a] Fifty years ago,these words were meant to produce a shudder of distaste in the manly reader, buttime and the revolution in sex roles have now made Bush’s prosecutorial judgmentsound value-free. Bush derides Shelley’s language in Prometheus Unbound: “palefeet,” “pale wound-worn limbs,” “soft and flowing limbs / And passion-partedlips.” Shelley’s sensual sex-crossing images seemed uncomfortably homoerotic.Bush’s attitude reflects the modern reaction against Swinburne, who borrowedfrom Shelley, and it also falls in the shadow of the disgraced Wilde. I suspectShelley modelled his canon of effeminate beauty on Michelangelo’s Pietà andandrogynous Hellenistic sculpture in Rome, where Prometheus Unbound was partlycomposed.The sexual passivity Abrams fails to note in the metaphor of the Aeolian lyre iscrucial to Shelley’s “Ode to the West Wind.” To overlook or ignore this elementis to misread the poem. The poet is the lyre through which wild nature makesmusic. The “ashes and sparks” of his thoughts fly from the inflamed fading coal.The poet is a “dead leaf,” like Epipsychidion’s incinerated moth. The“uncontrollable” west wind’s tremendous masculine force exaggerates the poet’sfrailty or creative reactivity. His “dead thoughts,” scattered across theuniverse “to quicken a new birth,” are seeds of insemination. But while thetorpid seed is Shelley’s, the ejaculation is the wind’s. Astonishingly, the poetis a passive inseminator. Man is half-loved, half-raped by nature. Poetry ispanting sex speech, wrung from slaves on a long invisible leash. The poet asocean “wave” again recalls Coleridge’s feminine sea spread beneath Wordsworth’spower. But Coleridge’s wave swells languorously, while Shelley’s peaks withfeverish sexual excitement. The “Ode to the West Wind” is a spiritual sex dramaof vast proportions. The poem’s greatness, its electrifying expansive rush,resides precisely in the poet’s ability to project himself and us into thesensation of passive surrender to titanic power. Shelley’s ecstasy comes fromconvention-defying sex experience. He is erotically joined, body and soul, tothe wind as masculine ravisher. “Ode to the West Wind” is a tour de force ofsex-crossing Romantic imagination. I view it as a sexualized revision of themagnificent “Mont Blanc,” where Shelley contemplates the stunning enormity ofnature, a bleak geologic panorama without sexual personae.The Aeolian lyre expresses not just the passivity but the compulsiveness ofRomantic creativity. Achievement drives from the unknown part of self. Nietzschethinks artists undersexed: “Their vampire, their talent, grudges them as a rulethat squandering of force which one calls passion. If one has a talent, one isalso its victim; one lives under the vampirism of one’s talent.”24[ch25_notes.html#ch14note24a] This is true of anyone pursuing an obsessiveproject, which steals years and drains love. Yeats reformulates the metaphor ofpassive poet-as-lyre: “We who are poets and artists … live but for the momentwhen vision comes to our weariness like terrible lightning, in the humility ofthe brutes.”25 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note25a] We saw the protracted birth-agonyof Cellini’s Perseus. Shelley says, “A great statue or picture grows under thepower of the artist as a child in the mother’s womb.”26[ch25_notes.html#ch14note26a] Male artists have Erik Erikson’s female “innerspace.” Giving the artist a male womb (like Euripides’ Zeus), Shelley radicallyalters masculine body-image. Nature makes woman’s body a humid bower, model forSpenser’s Bower of Bliss. The body is first sculptor of imagination. Malehomosexuality, for example, is not aesthetically or emotionally equivalent toheterosexuality. The man who is anally penetrated or who takes another’s penisin his mouth is making his body a female bower.Shelley claims the poet is “more delicately organized than other men, andsensible to pain and pleasure, both his own and that of others, in a degreeunknown to them.”27 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note27a] The nervous, impressionablepoet has a feminine sensitivity. He is a stranger exiled among virile men. Theprice for the Romantic poet’s appropriation of female powers is mutilation,which Erich Neumann calls “the condition of all creation.”28[ch25_notes.html#ch14note28a] Western literature begins with a blind bard. Thehead of the poet Orpheus, torn to pieces by Maenads, floated to Lesbos,implanting that island with the first flowering of Greek lyric genius.Romantic mutilation is ritual self-limitation. With the failure of hierarchiesat the close of the Enlightenment, consciousness became stronger, but it did notbecome more masculine. Paradoxically, the more it asserted, the more it had tofear. We saw in Kleist’s Penthesilea that unlimited expansion of self producesparalyzing anxiety. There was an excess of phenomena no longer ordered by socialstructures, phenomena flooding consciousness in an exhausting plenum. Thefemininity of the Romantic artist partly expresses his passivity toward thisoppressive multiplicity. The artist sacrifices his virility as a propitiation ofunknown gods. The problem of evil had an assigned place in all-inclusiveChristian theology. But as religion weakened, evil sprang free. The evil ofchthonian nature is far less rational and explicable than the evil of an enviousmaster demon. Romantic imagination faced evil without the organized certitudesof church and state. The power to punish was taken over by the self. Hence thenineteenth-century abundance of daemonic epiphanies of the double. The selfambushes, harasses, flails itself. Romanticism’s most terrifying encounter withthe double was ironically by the atheist Shelley. Making himself feminine, thepoet was under the fascist rod of what he had repressed.Keats, Shelley’s slain Adonis, supplements and corrects Wordsworth. Keats’snature welcomes rather than abandons, because he restores to it the sensualityand eroticism that Wordsworth removed. But Keats, as much as Wordsworth, cannotbear the daemonism Coleridge sees in sex and nature. Reviving the femmes fatalesof The Faerie Queene, Keats revises the unpalatable facts of female power. Hispoetry is a Eumenides, a renaming and palliation. Keats turns every Fury into a“Kindly One.” His clear, simple style is as much a defense mechanism as Blake’sin the stormy, opaque prophetic books. Keats’s sexual anxiety, suppressed in thepoems, is perfectly apparent in his letters.Keats’s theory of creativity comes from Wordsworth’s “wise passiveness.” LikeByron, Keats esteems a happy “Laziness” or fainting “languour,” “a state ofeffeminacy.” Nature visits us with thoughts: “let us open our leaves like aflower and be passive and receptive.” Indolence, theme of an ode, is wakingsleep. Sleep for Keats is a mode of vision, putting masculine power intofeminine suspension. “Negative Capability” gives a man the ability to remain “inuncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &reason.” Great men, “especially in Literature” and Shakespeare above all,possess negative capability, which is female waiting, a refusal to intervene,impose, or dominate.29 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note29a]“The camelion Poet,” says Keats, is “every thing and nothing”:He has no Identity—he is continually in for—and filling some other Body. … WhenI am in a room with People if I ever am free from speculating on creations of myown brain, then not myself goes home to myself: but the identity of every one inthe room begins to press upon me that I am in a very little time annihilated—The receptive poet is in metamorphosis, dissolving into multiple identities.Other beings pass through him as if he were a wraith. The poet is likePlutarch’s Dionysus, who turns into winds, water, earth, stars, plants, animals.Keats’s Dionysian self-transformations are clear in “Bright Star,” where bysympathetic identification he projects himself into star, sea, and shore. Theidentity-free poet is a feminine receptacle into which pour the Many of nature.Keats says of all “Men of Genius,” “they have not any individuality, anydetermined Character.”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note30a] Geniuses nullify theirown western personalities. The Keatsian man of vision is a transsexual shamanlike Empedocles, who claimed that in former lives he was a boy, a girl, a bush,a bird, and a fish.Organic life floods into Keats’s imagery like a green tide. Things have vividsensory presence. The delicacies Porphyro sets before his sleeping beloved inThe Eve of St. Agnes are so individuated, so uncannily materialized that oneexpects them to stand up and demand to be introduced. The great ode “To Autumn”is a series of lush holograms. By a cinema of kinesthesia, the Dionysianfeelies, Keats reproduces the harvest fruits as they “swell” and “plump” withmouth-filling fatness. Words bubble with nascence. Language itself is inadvanced pregnancy. “To Autumn” internalizes the nature mother at her fleshiest.Keats’s indolence slows the male body to the fecund rhythms of natural process,that creeping, interminable cycle in which women live. Keats says of women heloved, “My mind was a soft nest in which some one of them slept though she knewit not.”31 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note31a] Wordsworth speaks of Coleridgean“caverns” of the mind, Shelley of the artist’s “womb.” In Keats, the mind iswarm bed and amniotic sac, fetally encapsulating the beloved and suspending herin honey. She lives in the poet’s imagination. But she lives most vividly bysleeping. She is removed from the social arena of action and returned toembryonic innocence. Think of the sleeping heroine of The Eve of St. Agnes: isher sleep nature’s sacralization—or Keats’s neutralization of woman’s sexualdanger?Keats speaks of the heart as “the teat from which the Mind or intelligence sucksits identity.”32 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note32a] He gives primacy to emotionallife, identified as feminine. If the heart is breastlike, the poet is a shamanwith female breasts. Even read conservatively, the metaphor forces us to see afeminine heart-breast hovering just inside the male chest wall. Keats is theTeiresias androgyne, the nurturant male, whom I also find in Egyptian Hapi, theNile god with female dugs, and in Roman personifications of the Nile and FatherTiber, a burly, bearded nude reclining under a swarm of rollicking infants. TheTeiresias androgyne rules The Eve of St. Agnes: the most brilliantly writtenpart of the poem is when the male reverses sexual convention and feeds thefemale. Keats’s language suddenly intensifies into a sensual cascade of ripenouns and adjectives. The poem turns cornucopia.Lionel Trilling says: “We are ambivalent in our conception of the moral statusof eating and drinking. … But with Keats the ingestive imagery is pervasive andextreme.”33 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note33a] Trilling is wonderful on Keats’sappetitiveness and its connection to the maternal, but his essay has apsychological inconsistency approaching incoherence. Trilling insists on Keats’s“manliness” or “mature masculinity,” when all the evidence he presentscontradicts it. Food language in The Eve of St. Agnes has a stunning virtuosity.Porphyro lays out “a heap / Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd; /With jellies soother than the creamy curd, / And lucent syrops, tinct withcinnamon.” Keats’s ingestive imagery invokes the sense of taste for one reason:to induce liquidity. The quick, short consonants and oozing vowels subvert thereader’s detachment from and control over the poem, artfully compelling him tosalivate. I call this passage mouth-embowering. It replicates in the reader’sskull the poem’s embowered bed-scene, with its luxurious ritual of malenurturance. A contemporary said Keats had a “capacious mouth.” We will return tothe idea of a capacious skull. Of all male artists, there is in Keats the leastflight from liquidity. Sartre’s Nausea is the most passionate protest againstthe mother-ruled realm of the moist, a gluey “mucoid.” Keats seems the mostreverent and affectionate of nature-sons, finding in the moist not annihilatedconsciousness but enhanced imagination, a new paradise garden.But great literature and art are never affirmative. Or rather, affirmation isalways a swerve from the negative. We celebrate in order to win victory oversomething else, something uncontrolled. Of major western artists, Raphael andKeats are closest to the all-benign. But both were in competition with an oldergeneration of brooding titans, their artistic fathers. Did Raphael and Keatschoose masquing sexual personae? They eluded by seeming too generous toconfront. Take “Lamia,” Keats’s poem about a snake-vampire imprisoning a male ina house of illusion. Imagination is perilous, yet reason, embodied inApollonius, is too rigid. Critics identify Apollonius as the Alexandrianphilosopher of Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy. But in the poem’s latentmythology, Apollonius is Apollo, who slays the female Python at Delphi. “Lamia”recapitulates the Oresteia, where Apollo triumphs—as he can never do inRomanticism. Bush recognizes Coleridge’s Christabel as the main influence on thepoem. There is a tremendous alteration of tone between Christabel and “Lamia.”Chthonian menace and horror yield to geniality and melodiousness. “Lamia” ispolemical and propitiatory; it turns the archetypal female into a “Kindly One.”Her daemonism is honored but distanced, repositioned in safe relation to thepsyche. Lamia, a sexual fiend and man-killer, is beautifully reimagined untilshe improbably glows like a Raphael Madonna. Keatsian charm is her aura, thesoft nest of the poet’s best wishes.Keats’s letters to Fanny Brawne as he was composing “Lamia,” partly inspired byher, plainly reveal the turbulence expressed in Christabel but concealed ortransformed in “Lamia.” Walter Jackson Bate’s biography of Keats (1963) is oneof the great books of our time, with the force and sweep of a nineteenth-centurynovel. But Bate’s commentary, so movingly truthful for five hundred pages, comesapart when it deals with Keats’s letters to Fanny Brawne. This is Keats’s mostfertile period. Yet his letters seethe with jealousy, hostility, obsession. Batedoes not know what to do with Keats’s jealousy and suggests he is affecting it.Keats’s benevolence had become such a scholarly convention it was impossible tothink anything else. There is an abyss in Bate’s study between Keats’s emotionaland creative lives. Keats tells Woodhouse “he does not want ladies to read hispoetry: that he writes for men.” He bitterly assails contemporary women writersand intellectuals. To his friend Bailey:I am certain I have not a right feeling towards Women—at this moment I amstriving to be just to them but I cannot—Is it because they fall so far beneathmy Boyish imagination? … When among Men I have no evil thoughts, no malice, nospleen—I feel free to speak or to be silent—I can listen and from every one Ican learn—my hands are in my pockets I am free from all suspicion andcomfortable. When I am among Women I have evil thoughts, malice spleen—I cannotspeak or be silent—I am full of Suspicions and therefore listen to no thing—I amin a hurry to be gone—Faced with this amazing passage, Bate eloquently argues that Keats suffers suchfeelings because his mind is “strongly empathic or sympathetic,” “habituated toidentifying itself with what it conceives,” and with women “such anidentification is lacking.”34 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note34a] This is credibleonly if one holds the Trilling view of Keats’s “manliness.” Probably the firstto apply the word “manly” to Keats was Bailey himself. As with Coleridge callingWordsworth “all man,” it tells us less about Keats than about Bailey.“Manliness” is an utterly inappropriate word for a poet who extolls theimaginative virtues of passivity and effeminacy. Far from being unable toidentify with women, as Bate claims, Keats in women’s company ran the risk ofover identification, loss of psychic autonomy. I adapt from the letter on thechameleon poet: woman’s overfull identity “begins to press upon” Keats, so thathe is “in a very little time annihilated.” My theory seems confirmed by Keats’scomplaint to Fanny Brawne: “You have absorb’d me.” Keats flees the company ofwomen to escape being swallowed up by them. Their hunger is infinite.The idealized view of Keats leaves us at a loss with “La Belle Dame Sans Merci,”one of the supreme Romantic poems. Its heroine is a Circean sexual predator.Robert Graves sees her as his White Goddess, which Bloom calls a “misreading.”35[ch25_notes.html#ch14note35a] I too think it a misreading, but for differentreasons. I follow in the Italian sado-baroque line of Mario Praz: I think thatthe sexual level of “La Belle Dame Sans Merci” is primary and that any allegoryis supplemental and diversionary. Graves’s hieratic White Goddess is wrong,since Keats’s charmer is mysteriously undaunting: “I met a lady in the meads, /Full beautiful—a faery’s child, / Her hair was long, her foot was light, / Andher eyes were wild.” The poem’s sexual personae puzzled me for a decade.Representationally, Keats’s “beautiful woman without mercy,” destroyingwarriors, princes, and kings, is nonhierarchic. How does this disarmingandrogyne exert her masculine power?—a power manifest only a posteriori, never apriori in the persona she presents to human eyes. She is springtime naturetricking us into the winter of our discontent. Still, there is theater. What isher mask? I finally found an analogue to Keats’s Belle Dame: the ruthless LadyCaroline Lamb, whom I compared to Goethe’s Mignon and Warhol’s Edie Sedgwick.This is the negative Mercurius androgyne, elfin, gamine, manic with nervousenergy. Proof can be found in Keats’s description of Fanny Brawne, model for hisBelle Dame. It could serve as a portrait of Lady Caroline. Fanny is “beautifuland elegant, graceful, silly, fashionable and strange.” Her face is “pale andthin.” She is “monstrous in her behaviour flying out in all directions, callingpeople such names.” Bate says other accounts of Fanny Brawne convey “her quickliveliness of manner and movement” and “general vivacity.”36[ch25_notes.html#ch14note36a] Mercurius is electric with hidden shocks. Keatslyricizes woman but cannot defeat her.Keats’s low opinion of women intellectuals is part of his antipathy to thetrendy literary world. But it also relates to his poems of sexual danger, fromEndymion through “Lamia” to “La Belle Dame Sans Merci.” Scholars who fail to seeanxiety in Keats’s sex poems readily acknowledge it in the Hyperion sequence,where the coloration is cool, grave, and desolate. Warmth for Keats is likelight for Shelley. Appetite, tactility, body heat: when these gutter out, we areleft with Dantesque grey. Keats’s Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion arerite-de-passage poems, perhaps the most striking in literature. In the first,Apollo moves from one psychic stage to the next. In the second, it is Keatshimself. For Bloom, these poems record crises of poetic belatedness. But in thepoems’ deep structure, men are overpowered by female titans. Hyperion opens on atableau of male impotence and is set into motion by infusions of female energy.This sexual double vision may have inaugurated the entire Hyperion sequence: ahumiliating panorama of female domination and broken manhood.Taking place at the transition from one generation of gods to the next, Hyperionbegins in a masculine vacuum. The Muse-like females are connecting historicallinks. The third book repeats the poem’s opening cycle. We find the poet Apolloweeping and inert. The titaness Mnemosyne, his invisible guardian, comes to hisaid. Mnemosyne (Memory) fills him with “names, deeds, grey legends,” pouringthem into “the wide hollows” of his brain. This is one of the classic moments ofRomantic sex-reversal. A dominatrix inseminates the passive poet with a torrentof knowledge, which Yeats borrows and sexually normalizes for “Leda and theSwan.” Keats’s female fecundator forces herself into the poet’s vaginal skull,an image Keats repeats in The Fall of Hyperion, where Moneta’s “hollow brain” is“enwombed.” Apollo’s brain-womb brims over through spiritual intercourse withnature and history.Keats’s Apollo has an elegant androgynous beauty—undulating “golden tresses” andlimbs of “immortal fairness.” He is a Hellenistic Apollo melting into Aphrodite.His “white melodious throat” is an Adonis motif I have defined as cross-sexualin a male. Apollo’s sensuous “white soft temples” magically appear at the poem’smost violent moment. Keats feminizes the head of all poets. Apollo isself-embowered in moody adolescence, which Mnemosyne forcibly terminates. Theephebic poet is raped by a female colossus, who injects him with a rushing senseof the reality of things outside himself. Like the vampire with Christabel, shespeaks through the poet by invading his personality. Can she really make him agod? Hartman compares Apollo’s paroxysm to the pangs of “childbirth or sexualclimax.”37 [ch25_notes.html#ch14note37a] Apollo gives birth to himself out ofhis own head, Zeus and Athena in one. His “wild commotions” are vatic spasms,prefiguring those of his oracle. In The Fall of Hyperion, Keats himself shouts“with a Pythia’s spleen.” Hyperion ends in poetic couvade, with Apollo shriekingin pain.Just before we see what Apollo brings to birth, Hyperion breaks off midsentence,leaving a row of asterisks. Scholars try to explain this puzzling truncation,with no agreement. The end of Hyperion belongs to my Apollonian category ofmuteness, stammering, and broken speech. Hyperion is self-frustrated because itattempts to transform the Apollo-poet from androgyne into potent male. Since itis a Romantic poem, it cannot do this. It meets a sexual barrier which Romanticimagination cannot pass and from which it falls back in defeat. Like Christabel,Hyperion is inspired by the poet’s vision of sexual subordination to asupernatural female hierarch. Keats cannot finish Hyperion for the same reasonColeridge cannot finish Christabel: the entrancing hermaphroditic psychodrama iscomplete and will brook no sequel.In The Fall of Hyperion, a reconstruction of Hyperion, Keats takes over Apollo’srole. The saga comes nearer. In the mysterious sanctuary of his dream, the poetsees a distant image with features huge as a cloud. It is a statue of defeatedSaturn, but for most of the poem, its gender is indeterminate. The onlycompetence in the Hyperion poems belongs to spectral female superpowers, whooppress even as they liberate. Moneta is silent, terrific, uncanny. The poetswoons again and again: “I had a terror of her robes, / And chiefly of theveils.” The ghostly veils “curtain’d her in mysteries,” constricting the poet’sheart. Moneta’s veils are from the house of Spenserian couture. Is she theveiled hermaphrodite Venus of The Faerie Queene? If so, she is all-knowing,ever-secret mother nature. In Keats, she is the true threat to poetry. Moneta is“the veiled shadow” or “the tall shade”—desexing locutions like Shelley’snuminous dematerializations. Keats’s towering women are androgynes, monumentaltotems of world-force. Cloudy Saturn may be only a displacement or psychic splitof veiled Moneta. When he appears in the second poem, he is much weaker than inthe first. Moneta has overwhelmed him poetically. When Saturn rises painfullyand starts to walk, the poem breaks off. He is now an anemic shade, drained offictive energy.Hyperion’s Mnemosyne is more maternal than The Fall of Hyperion’s severe,sepulchral Moneta. Moneta makes the second poem palpably more anxious than thefirst. This anxiety is not just about poetic vocation but about sex andidentity. The Greeks, says Farnell, tried “to avoid the mention, whereverpossible, of the personal names of the chthonian powers and to substitute forthem appellatives which were generally euphemistic.”38[ch25_notes.html#ch14note38a] Keats’s poetry treats the chthonian with ritualeuphemism. His “Ode on a Grecian Urn” becomes darker if one accepts my principlethat the western objet d’art is an Apollonian protest against the chthonian. IfKeats’s monumental females are sober versions of the Great Mother, then hisambivalence toward them must reflect a latent ambivalence toward biologicprocess. His vivid sensory imagery and capacious vaginal skull bring the body tobirth by pure imagination, dramatized in Apollo’s painful self-extrusion. Isthis hostile usurpation of female power? Keats goes around sex directly to theprima materia— evading the mother. Like Blake and Wordsworth, he tries toabolish sexual personae. But he is haunted by daemonic hierarchic females. Bybecoming the identity-free chameleon poet, Keats eliminates gender. Dissolutionof identity also abolishes the female sex. In “To Autumn,” woman is unneeded,for she has been internalized by the poet, with his capacious, fecund, andself-irrigating imagination. The feminized male self becomes all-encompassingand self-sufficient. Keats’s poems, opening the reader to nature, close off thepoet in his own rigorous ritual precinct."},{"pageContent":"15CULTS OF SEX AND BEAUTYBalzacDecadence is the Mannerist late phase of Romantic style. Romantic imaginationbroke through all limits. Decadence, burdened by freedom, invents harsh newlimits, psychosexual and artistic. It is a process of objectification andfixation, disciplining and intensifying the rogue western eye. High Romanticismvalued energy, room to breathe. Decadent Late Romanticism shuts the doors andlocks self and eye in pagan cultism. Its nature theory follows Sade andColeridge, who see nature’s cruelty and excess. Art supplants nature. The objetd’art becomes the center of fetishistic connoisseurship. Person is transformedinto beautiful thing, beyond the law. Decadence takes western sexual personae totheir ultimate point of hardness and artificiality. It is drenched in sex, butsex as thought rather than action. Decadence is an Apollonian raid on theDionysian, the aggressive eye pinning and freezing nature’s roiling objects.France pioneered in modern sophistication. The arrogant, urbane French mannerbegan in the court world of the ancien régime. Imitated by Oscar Wilde, itbecame what I call the English epicene, transplanted to America asmale-homosexual manners. French sophistication is an excess of wordly knowledge,a cynicism born of turbulence and reaction. From its self-devouring revolutionto the Nazi occupation, France seemed destined to a cycle of extravagant prideand humiliation. English Romanticism, unchecked by national disasters, projectedits optimism into nineteenth-century popular culture. But French Romanticism,buffeted by politics, quickly turned into Decadence. The century’s firstcompletely Decadent work is Balzac’s Sarrasine (1830), which was written fourmonths after the July Revolution and rise to the throne of Louis Philippe, theCitizen King. The same year saw the first noisy avant-garde debut, when VictorHugo’s Hernani opened to a jeering, cheering audience. The French polarizationof artist and bourgeois, fiercest in the struggle between painter and Academy,helped formalize the public ritualism of Decadence.Behind Sarrasine is Fragoletta (1829), a forgotten novel by Balzac’s friend,Henri de Latouche, which also influenced Gautier’s Mademoiselle de Maupin(1835), a central text of French and English Decadence to the end of thecentury. Latouche’s heroine, Camille, nicknamed Fragoletta (“littlestrawberry”), is a transvestite adolescent surely inspired by Goethe’s boyishMignon. But while Mignon dies before sexual maturity, Camille lives on. As inThe Monk, novel’s end forces us to reread. Camille turns out to be the sameperson as her twin brother, a callous despoiler of girls. The lesbian themereappears at the luxurious court of Naples, where the queen seduces Emma, LadyHamilton, wife of the English ambassador. Camille’s self-transformation into aninvented male twin is prefigured by the “Sleeping Hermaphrodite” that she andher companions inspect in Naples. Latouche calls the statue a “fabulous reverie”expressing man’s “double nature,” words echoed in a Gautier poem. The visitorsare “poor northerners” who are “lost in the labyrinth of thought” and unable tocomprehend the Hermaphrodite. Italians, on the other hand, “continue antiquity”by their worship of beauty, a theme Gautier expands in Maupin.1[ch25_notes.html#ch15note1a] Latouche is, to my knowledge, the first writer tojoin the androgyne to the amoral cult of beauty, a Decadent staple. Camille,denying she is of the human species, already suffers from Decadent alienation.Though it begins the androgyne’s Decadent career as a symbol of damnation,Fragoletta as a whole has an airiness and robustness we see again only inMaupin. The ominous closed spaces of the Decadence are created by Sarrasine.Normally classed as a social novelist, Balzac also belongs to the history ofnineteenth-century Decadence. Many of his major characters are double-sexed. Thesocial novel is the literary genre least hospitable to the androgyne, forreasons I will address. Balzac, like Goethe, is dual. As a novelist, he isdocumentary and analytic. As a Romantic, he is perverse and occult. It is fromsex-crossing Romantic imagination that his androgynes come. In The Human Comedy,as in Faust, the androgyne symbolizes the all-inclusiveness of the text itself,subsuming opposites of sex, mood, and style.In Sarrasine, a pivotal work in the shift from High to Late Romanticism, Balzacreimagines the Italian adventures of Latouche’s transvestite heroine in Decadentterms. Visiting Rome in 1758, Sarrasine, a French sculptor, falls madly in lovewith a prima donna, La Zambinella. The singer embodies the “ideal beauty”celibate Sarrasine has vainly sought in real life, the model for which were “therich, sweet creations of ancient Greece.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note2a] Onlyafter a rendezvous with Zambinella does Sarrasine learn, to his publichumiliation, that she is a male, a castrato. Again, a sexual revelation forcesus to reread. Zambinella’s first appearance onstage becomes a sacred epiphany,ravishing Sarrasine with a vision of hermaphrodite perfection. Ideal beauty haseluded him because ordinary mortals have one gender, while Zambinella issexually composite, in the Greek way. Sarrasine’s susceptibility comes from hisartistic self-absorption. He has no sexual needs because he is alreadyhalf-feminine. Barthes points out, in a muddled commentary, that the nameSarrasine connotes “femininity”; the usual French form would be Sarrazin.3[ch25_notes.html#ch15note3a] Hence the androgyne Sarrasine can be emotionallysubjugated only by another androgyne. He dies a virgin, assassinated by order ofZambinella’s patron, a homosexual cardinal.Romantic poetry, I noted, grants virility no privileges. Sarrasine, a LateRomantic fiction, eradicates virility altogether by making a castrate itspremiere sexual persona. Eunuchs in Byron’s Don Juan are merely decorativeaccessories. Now the eunuch is hierarchized as an idol inspiring love and lust.Romanticism evades sexuality through its withdrawal from masculine action, butBalzac frustrates sex by deforming nature. Sarrasine reviles Zambinella:“Monster! You who can give life to nothing!” Seceding from nature, Decadencewipes Rousseau out of Romanticism. Sade, we saw, combats Rousseau by daemonizingnature and descending into its turbulence. Decadence turns from energy towardstasis. Romantic creative passivity becomes Decadent aestheticism,contemplativeness toward precious things sealed off from nature. Balzac’sZambinella is the first Decadent art object. The transsexual castrato is anartificial sex, product of biology manipulated for art. Zambinella does givebirth—to other art objects. First is Sarrasine’s statue of him/her; then amarble copy commissioned by the cardinal; next a painting of Adonis based on thecopy; finally, Girodet’s sensuous painting of effeminate sleeping Endymion,inspired, Balzac claims, by Zambinella as Adonis. The sterile castrato,propagating itself through other art works, is an example of my technologicalandrogyne, the manufactured object. Like Vergil’s Trojan Horse, he/she teemswith inorganic seed.Like Coleridge’s poet, Zambinella is privileged but cursed. Her castration isthe shamanistic sacrifice of virility accompanying a special gift in antiquity.Showered with acclaim, she suffers harsh removal from normal life. She hateshumanity: “For me, the world is a desert. I am an accursed creature.” Theandrogyne’s lonely isolation looks backward toward Fragoletta and forward towardBaudelaire’s “Delphine and Hippolyte,” which borrows Balzac’s words. Zambinellainhabits an uncanny temenos, a sequestered zone created by her hieratic power.When Sarrasine first sees her, she is protected by the theatrical frame, throughwhich no one can step. Visiting her mansion, he is led through a moonlit“labyrinth” of halls and stairs to the innermost sanctum, a sumptuous“mysterious room.” Zambinella is kept, in effect, in a seraglio, a motif Balzacreuses in The Girl with the Golden Eyes. The physical and psychologicalimprisonment is Decadent. Sarrasine’s pitiless hierarch, the shadowy cardinal,keeps Zambinella in bondage. She is a prized art object lent for guarded publicdisplay. Hovering in detached omniscience, the cardinal is like Cellini’s hiddenDuke listening to the crowd’s adulation of Perseus. The work is under jealouswatch, amorous and despotic.In Shelley’s Epipsychidion I found psychological heliotropism, the westernpattern of erotic submission to a personality as art object. The Decadence turnsthis into obsession and enslavement, shown by Sarrasine’s first reaction toZambinella: “Fame, knowledge, future, existence, laurels, everything collapsed.”His personality is invaded and his artistic autonomy overthrown. When thedream-woman proves fake, he plots revenge, but as a Romantic male he cannot act.Instead of killing, he is killed. The story’s ritual pattern is an Actaeon myth:Sarrasine is slain for having seen something forbidden. All Rome knowsZambinella’s status, but Sarrasine is a stranger blundering into a domain ofritual conventions and proscriptions. He profanes a religious mystery. Thecardinal is a vengeful high priest spilling the blood of an impious trespasser.Discussing Blake, I called the female body a veil and concealment, a series ofinner sanctuaries, like a temple. Sarrasine is a process of uncovering a bodynever actually seen naked. It records the discovery of gender, or rather ofnongender. Moving through successive closed spaces, the story takes its formbecause the castrato, by posing as a woman, makes it mimic the hiddenness offemale anatomy. Room by room, Sarrasine advances to the cella of thehermaphrodite god, veiled like Spenser’s Venus. Balzac gathers these penetratedspaces within a final border, the narrative present in which Zambinella’s pastis recreated for an appalled confidante.The novella brilliantly depicts Zambinella’s radiant glamour, luring Sarrasineinto an intrigue that closes about him. Remember the sexual errors ofShakespeare’s transvestite comedies. Despairing, Sarrasine demands ofZambinella: “Have you any sisters who resemble you? Then die!” This is not theRenaissance, where a lucky twin steps forward to deflect homoerotic impulsesinto marriage. Sarrasine’s sexual error ends in his death. He is a Decadentvictim to art, a new religion craving martyrs. What is modern about Sarrasine isits central question of sexual identity, Rousseau’s invention. Balzac showssexuality as something incomprehensible and deranging. The Renaissancetransvestites guide their admirers back to social integration. But Zambinella,odalisque and artistic solipsist in one, is a Decadent androgyne indifferent toher suitor’s fate. His annihilation reflects her own sexual self-cancellations.Zambinella’s glamour connects the Italian castrati to modern film stars, themost glamourous creatures since the Greco-Roman gods. Angus Heriot speaks ofearly opera’s “international star-system”: “The great singers of the eighteenthcentury were in a sense the precursors of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe.”4[ch25_notes.html#ch15note4a] Glamour and charisma are hermaphroditic principles.Balzac captures the decadence inherent in the Catholic castrati. Heriot callsecclesiastic policy “absurdly inconsistent”: even accomplices in the act ofcastration could be excommunicated, yet every Italian church had castratosingers, even the Vatican. St. Paul’s injunction that women keep silent inchurch kept them out of choirs until the seventeenth century and later. Hencehigh parts were taken by boys or eunuchs. Like English chimney sweeps, childrenwere sold into castration by impoverished parents. Protestants like Lady MaryWortley Montagu condemned the practice as barbaric.5[ch25_notes.html#ch15note5a] In Rome in 1745, Casanova makes Sarrasine’s sexualerror. An attractive person enters a café: “At the appearance of his hips, Itook him for a girl in disguise, and I said so to the abbé Gama; but the lattertold me that it was Bepino della Mamana, a famous castrato. The abbé called himover, and told him, laughing, that I had taken him for a girl. The impudentcreature, looking fixedly at me, told me that if I liked he would prove that Iwas right, or that I was wrong.” Casanova says of papal toleration of thecastrati, “Rome the holy city… in this way forces every man to become apederast.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note6a] The castrati system was anotherillustration of Roman Catholicism’s vestigial paganism.Opera’s star castrato inspired bisexual ardor. There were hot claques ofgroupies, a frenzied eroticism like the homosexual hysteria at Judy Garlandperformances, which I compared to orgiastic rites of the Great Mother. The staralways has a transsexual and hierarchic significance. He or she is a creator ofcults. Balzac’s description of Sarrasine’s passionate reaction to and conversionby Zambinella is, I conclude, the first analysis of the psychodynamics ofpopular culture. We see the actual moment of cathexis when eroticism istransferred from spectator to sexual persona in performance. Sarrasine is thethunderstruck modern movie fan.Queen Christina, Napoleon, Goethe, and Wagner sponsored or praised castrati. Thecastrate voice had a strange power not duplicated by soprano or countertenor.Schopenhauer called it “supernaturally beautiful,” with a “silver purity” yet“indescribable power.” Singer Emma Calvé called it “strange, sexless,superhuman, uncanny.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note7a] The castrato voice had moregravity and authority than a boy’s voice. The music of these mutilatedcreatures, irreparably indentured into artistic servitude, paradoxicallyattained a seraphic freedom and dignity. Like stars of the Hollywood studio, thecastrati were both slaves and hierarchs. Though several lived to the end of thenineteenth century, their great era was over by the 1820s. Their influence isstill felt in the transvestite breeches roles or pants parts now filled bywomen, such as Cherubino in Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro and Octavian inStrauss’s Der Rosenkavalier. Europe’s increasing liberalism would no longertolerate the castration of boys; so the disappearance of the castrati paralleledthe resistance to slavery and child labor. But there was also a change inartistic fashion: the epicene castrato voice belonged to the courtly ancienrégime.The Girl with the Golden Eyes (written March 1834-April 1835) is the second ofBalzac’s Decadent fictions. Structurally, it resembles Sarrasine: a mysteriouswoman is followed into a dangerous labyrinth and private prison. Both sexualadventures end in death, but now it is not the passionate pursuer but thesequestered sex-object who is slain. The dandy Henri de Marsay, hero of The Girlwith the Golden Eyes, is one of Balzac’s recurring characters, later rising toPrime Minister. At the Opéra in Lost Illusions, where he crushes provincialLucien de Rubempré with patrician snobbery, De Marsay has “a kind of girlishbeauty: beauty of a languid, effeminate kind.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note8a] Hisandrogyny causes all the trouble of The Girl with the Golden Eyes.Idle and spoiled, De Marsay holds no ethical or political beliefs whatever. TheEnglish Regency dandy was a final flowering of eighteenth-century epicene style,as embodied in that slippery court hermaphrodite, Lord Hervey. De Marsay isbased on contemporary Parisian dandies like the Due de Morny, with his“effeminate charm.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note9a] De Marsay must take his namefrom the Comte d’Orsay, the bewitching “Dandy or Exquisite” whom LadyBlessington scandalously added to her entourage. Byron called him “a beauty.”10[ch25_notes.html#ch15note10a] The New Yorker’s supercilious, monocled EustaceTilley is a dandy of the D’Orsay type.11 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note11a]The Girl with the Golden Eyes is dedicated to Delacroix, whose Oriental luxuryand barbarism came from Byron. De Marsay is the illegitimate son of a Frenchmarquise and the English libertine Lord Dudley, based on Byron. Like Byron,Dudley flees England in 1816 “to escape from English justice, which gives itsprotection to nothing exotic except merchandise.” Spotting De Marsay in Paris,Dudley asks who “the beautiful young man” is: “On hearing his name he said: ‘Ah!He’s my son. What a pity!’”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note12a] Like Byron,therefore, Dudley is both bisexual and negligent. He created a “secondmasterpiece,” a daughter sired upon a Spanish lady. None of his many bastardsknows the others.Balzac’s long prelude is a Dantean survey of the “inferno” of amoral Paris. Thecity is ruled by two forces, “gold and pleasure,” images to be fused in the girlwith the golden eyes. Meeting De Marsay in a garden, Paquita Valdes is overcomeby a “paralysing shock,” which the young man attributes to the “animalmagnetism” of “elective affinities.” These affinities come from the fact thatPaquita lives in sexual bondage to a Spanish lesbian, the Marquise de San-Real,who turns out to be De Marsay’s half-sister and hence his Byronic Romanticdouble. Paquita’s gold eyes signify her material value as a sensual and artisticobject. She is a victim of the cold acquisitiveness of Byron’s aristocraticchildren. Smuggled in as an alien, Paquita becomes a hapless symbol of Paris andits vices.De Marsay smugly assumes that the heavily guarded girl is the marquis’ mistress:“He was about to act the eternally old, eternally new comedy with threecharacters,” an old man, a girl, and a suitor. But De Marsay is in sexual error.The drama has one man and two women, and it will be tragedy, not comedy. At hisfirst rendezvous, De Marsay is blindfolded and driven endlessly through thestreets, an estranging device which makes his native city a sexual labyrinth.Balzac achieved the same effect in Sarrasine by transporting his hero from Paristo Rome. De Marsay reaches Paquita as Sarrasine does Zambinella in her palazzo,by ritualistic passage through a series of darkened rooms.De Marsay finds himself in a secret chamber, an opulent boudoir hung with redfabric and adorned with silver and gold. It is the first elaborate aestheticenvironment of the Decadence, looking forward to Baudelaire’s real-life salonand Huysmans’ mansion in A Rebours. Gautier says Balzac occupied an identicalsalon while writing The Girl with the Golden Eyes, but it is unclear which roominfluenced the other.13 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note13a] Balzac’s description ofthe boudoir is long, painterly, and deeply influenced by Delacroix. The lesbianmarquise, constructing a seraglio for a one-woman harem, is a female aestheteand hence the first Decadent architect. She is a Sadean libertine, her citadel,with its soundproofed walls, shutting out society and law. Her sexual arena is akind of tomb. Again we are in the claustrophobic space of the Decadence. Everydetail of décor is meant to “incite to voluptuousness.” Eros is intensified bycaptivity, a black-box theater of sexual personae. The boudoir is a SpenserianBower of Bliss or Blakean crystal cabinet, dedicated to the self-enjoyment ofthe female principle. Its asymmetrical design, half curved, half rectangular,reflects the marquise’s divided nature: female organicism joined to malegeometry, a psychic hermaphroditism. The color scheme—red, white, and pink—givesthe boudoir a vaginal character, crucial to the shocking finale.De Marsay’s first sex with the girl is transvestite: she puts him in a redvelvet gown and woman’s cap and shawl. His pleasure is unsurpassed. Is it due toPaquita’s virtuosity—or his female drag? Next day, he is furious: “Everythingshowed him that he had posed for another person.” Yet when he returns to theboudoir for a final rendezvous, he initiates the transvestism. His femininity issurfacing. At climax, he is stunned by “the first mortification” of his pamperedlife: Paquita deliriously calls out a woman’s name. He looks for a dagger tokill her, as if sudden action could remedy the affront to manhood. Paquita isclearly imagining her lover as the marquise, a transposition I call sexualmetathesis. De Marsay has been drafted into a sexual theater: he exists only tophallicize an absent woman lover. The girl with the golden eyes has exploitedhis virility for her own perverse purposes.De Marsay vows revenge. To kill Paquita, he and his friends assault the mansion,oddly meeting no resistance. In the boudoir, De Marsay finds the marquisereturned from London:The girl with the golden eyes lay dying, bathed in her own blood…. The whiteboudoir, in which the crimson of blood stood out so coldly, showed that aprolonged struggle had taken place. Paquita’s blood-stained hands were imprintedon the cushions…. Whole strips of the fluted hangings had been torn down bybleeding hands which doubtless had put up a long struggle. Paquita must evenhave tried to scramble up the wall. There were the marks of her feet along theback of the divan, along which she had no doubt run in her flight. Her wholebody, slashed by the dagger-thrusts of her executioner, showed how fiercely shehad fought… She was stretched out on the floor and, in her dying throes, hadbitten through the muscles of Madame de San-Real’s instep. The marquise wasstill holding her blood-stained dagger, her hair had been torn out in handfuls,she was covered with bites, several of which were still bleeding, and hertattered robe revealed her half-naked form and her lacerated breasts. She was atragic picture.She had the face of a fury avid for and redolent of blood. She was panting, withher mouth half-open, and her breath came too quickly for her to take the air inthrough her nostrils.Decadent eros, I said, treats the beloved as an objet d’art. Balzac demonstratesthe Decadent transformation of person into object in this horrifying scene,where the girl with the golden eyes is torn to shreds by her pitiless mistress.The fanatically preserved art work is dashed to pieces. The profusion of woundsis a brutal iteration of the murder’s provocation, the girl’s phallic defilementby De Marsay. Unlike the Ephesian Artemis, with her many penises, thehermaphrodite Marquise has one honed penis, the dagger, which makes manyvaginas. Her abuse of her lover’s body dramatizes Paquita’s femaleness, hersexual facticity or objecthood.The violence is intensified by the bloody devastation of the aesthetic boudoir.Acrasia’s Bower of Bliss is razed not by the white knight Guyon but by the witchherself. The marquise enacts a phallic rupture of the vaginal cell. Panting infrenzy and bleeding from her own wounds, she experiences a macro-orgasm throughher rape-murder of both girl and room. Balzac stages a savage Sadean orgy, areturn of Medea. The ransacked boudoir is a panorama of civilization disorderedby the chthonian. The scene seems to be an apocalypse of Romantic energy. Butno: we do not witness the murder, even by flashback or messenger speech. Like DeMarsay, we meet it when it is already a memory and the boudoir is inarchaeological ruins. Balzac is interested in the murder not as act but asApollonian tableau, a frozen Decadent glyph.Visually, the murder scene is surely modelled on Delacroix’s Death ofSardanapalus, with its tumult of destruction (fig. 36 [ch15.html#ch15fig36]).The marquise combines Byron’s cold-eyed effeminate emperor with the strainingguard plunging his knife into the throat of a nude odalisque, caught andsexually pinned from behind. The marquise, with her “moorish complexion,” isalso Byron’s sultana Gulbeyaz, who wears a poniard and here uses it. Balzac’smarquise is the first ferocious chthonian female of the Decadence, prefiguringCleopatra, Herodias, and Salomé. She is the virago androgyne, plushly female butmentally masculine. She is Dionysian because of her furor (she does not see DeMarsay) and her form-obliterating style of murder, a choppy Dionysian signature.A parallel with Sarrasine: the marquise, like the cardinal, is the jealoushierarch avenging profanation of a sequestered possession. But the cardinalsends emissaries armed with daggers, while the marquise, as an oriental Amazon,wields the murder weapon herself. A parallel with Coleridge’s Christabel: a sexcrime occurs in a palace nominally ruled by an aged, impotent male. Meanwhile,the house is being turned upside down by lesbianism and blood sports.Image [../images/f0398-01.jpg]36. Eugène Delacroix, Death of Sardanapalus, 1826.We wait in suspense for Paquita’s unknown guardian, until the daemonic epiphanyof the final pages. The marquise arrives like a medieval king returning from warto avenge a dishonored spouse. She left her bride in a chastity belt: Paquitalaments “the ring of bronze drawn round between myself and creation.” Bronzering, gold eyes, crowded circles of the Parisian inferno. Female sex-experience,centering upon the boudoir’s solipsistic Blakean rose, has a primitiveintractability and exclusivity. The true hierarch shows up in this story, as hedoes not in Sarrasine. How does Balzac depict it? The eagerly awaited personappears first as a foot! When De Marsay bursts into the boudoir, we look throughhis eyes at the dying Paquita and ravaged room, minutely described. Then weglance up Paquita’s prone body to find her teeth sunk in the marquise’s foot.The novella now abandons the girl and transfers its attention to the marquise,with whom it remains to the end. Balzac’s technique is astonishingly propheticof cinematic style. His eye is camera and spotlight. He pans the boudoir, zoomsin on a foot, then slowly rises to take in the statuesque marquise. The bittenfoot belongs to a Decadent aesthetic. Havelock Ellis says of Decadent art, “Thewhole is subordinated to the parts.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note14a] Overalldesign is atomized, as in Mannerism. Balzac’s marquise appears not just as afoot but as part of a foot, an instep, and even as part of that, the muscles ofan instep. The human is reduced to the bestial, as with Dante’s skull-gnawingUgolino. But Dante’s women never sink so low. Balzac uses his romance of thefixed foot as a narrative rite de passage, turning the track of the story towarda new character. In this singular moment, French literary imagination veerstoward Decadence.The finale of The Girl with the Golden Eyes anticipates a classic moment ofcinema. Paquita is not just killed but slaughtered, butchered, as in the murderscene of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960). In Hitchcock as in Balzac, aknife-wielding hermaphrodite (the transvestite Norman Bates, played by AnthonyPerkins) compulsively slashes the body of a beautiful woman enclosed in a femalebower (Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, ecstatically soaping herself in a gleamingwhite shower). The horror of the two scenes comes from the mutilation of asensuous female body around which an erotic aura has been painstakingly builtup, in Balzac by the stressing of Paquita’s “luminous” beauty and in Hitchcockby the voyeuristic display of half-naked Janet Leigh, who models lingerie fromthe first scene on. Until her unfortunate shower, Marion tends to appear inimposing Fifties brassieres, white then black, in accord with her changing moralmood. Is she vulnerable to attack only when she removes her Amazonian armature?Dying Paquita rips down the drapes, and dying Marion rips down the showercurtain. Tearing of a veil signifies destruction of the bower of the femalebody. Balzac and Hitchcock turn the beautiful woman into an object. Marion’sblood flows indifferently with the bathwater down the drain. Her body fallsawkwardly over the edge of the tub. Her cheek is deformed by the tile floor. Andthe last we see of her is her dead eye, lingered over by the camera until it hasthe iconicism of Paquita’s golden eyes. Cold and marmoreal but still glitteringwith beauty, Marion’s eye belongs to a fallen statue, an art object vandalizedand abandoned. Balzac and Hitchcock record symbolic sex acts by megalomaniacalbut phallically impotent cultists. Norman Bates, like the marquise, has his ownsequestered ritual love-object—the body of his mummified mother!We left the marquise standing distracted over Paquita’s body. When she finallysees De Marsay, she rushes at him with raised dagger. He seizes her by the arm,and for a long moment they stand trembling, staring at each other in cold shock:“The two Menaechmi could not have been more alike. In one breath they asked thesame question: ‘Is not Lord Dudley your father?’“ Pointing to Paquita, De Marsaysays, “She remained true to the blood.” This is the story’s second frozentableau. The Romantic fraternal doubles come together in a great recognitionscene. Their terror is from confronting an uncanny mirror-image. The desire inShelley’s Epipsychidion to enter into deep emotional or sexual dialogue withone’s double is fulfilled in The Girl with the Golden Eyes. Though brother andsister are strangers, they irresistibly meet through the magnetism of theiridentical soul-substance, a gravitation at work in The Monk, where incest isinadvertently committed. Byron’s incest, I said, may be a dream of copulatingwith oneself in sexually transmuted form, something that nearly happens inBalzac: De Marsay grabs and kisses the marquise, who pulls away. A displacedincest has in fact occurred, for both brother and sister lust for and enjoy thesame sexual object. Gang rape by army platoons or fraternity brothers mayconceal subliminal homosexual impulses. Similarly, the marquise and De Marsaymeet in the body of Paquita, whom they both inseminate. They flood her withtheir superior force, sweeping her away.Brother and sister have “the same voice.” Both are aesthetes, sensualists,murderers. Balzac makes half-feminine Byron the progenitor of twin androgynes.In this Twelfth Night, Viola is fiercer than Sebastian. De Marsay is an epiceneHellenistic Apollo, and his twin is Artemis as Mistress of the Beasts. Beforeand after the murder, the marquise too is a Decadent. She leaves bound for aSpanish convent, a typical Decadent pattern: the voluptuary ends in the church,stepping easily from perversion to celibacy, simply exchanging one ritualizedexcess for another. In the convent, will the marquise undertake an impiousmemorialization of dead Paquita? Or will she replay the lesbian caprices ofDiderot’s The Nun? The marquise imports archaic Mediterranean barbarism intomodern Paris, just as Cleopatra threatens to do to Rome. De Marsay’s passagethrough city labyrinth to secret boudoir is thus a regression through history,where, as always in Romanticism, incest waits as a spiritual destination.De Marsay calls Paquita “the most adorably feminine woman I have ever met.” Asin Spenser, Blake, and Sade, femininity is an invitation to disaster. This isobvious when De Marsay and friends invade the mansion. Mythologically, the menshould be liberators, like Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the monster (thelesbian marquise). Instead, in a Decadent reversal, the men come to slay themaiden. Hence feminine Paquita is crushed between opposing forces. She is killedboth for insulting the masculine principle and for yielding to it. Theilliterate girl knows nothing but sex, Sadean philosophy of the boudoir. Shepractices a sexual alchemy, discovering and reinforcing the twinship of themarquise and De Marsay by imposing a rusing sexual persona upon him. LikeShelley’s Witch, she fabricates a servant Hermaphrodite, a male mannequin of themarquise. Simultaneously, she intensifies the androgyny of the marquise, whosejealousy shifts her radically toward the masculine extreme. Submitting infantasy to the woman with a penis, Paquita creates her, for the marquise seizesthe phallic dagger to slay her. Balzac confirms Spenser’s and Blake’s intuitionof the erotic perversity of unqualified femininity: flirting with De Marsay,Paquita induces her own rape-murder.Naturalistically, De Marsay deputizes his friends to overcome the mansion’sguards, who melt away by their arrival. But archetypally, De Marsay needs malecompanions to retain his own gender in a hallucinatory female environment. Ifthe marquise is Byron’s Gulbeyaz, the mansion is Don Juan’s seraglio, wherevirility is yoked and mocked. De Marsay’s transvestism is thus Don Juan’s asJuanna. Like Byron’s seraglio, the boudoir is a matriarchate guarded byeunuchs—here the sinister African Christemio, foreshadowing the ghoulisheunuch-executioner of Gustave Moreau’s Salomé. Paquita has polluted a femalesanctuary. For her sacrilege of admitting a male, like Publius Clodiustransvestized at rites of the Bona Dea, she is slain and the temple destroyed.The marquise murders Paquita as a holocaust to an angry goddess. Since this is aRomantic fiction, the sanctuary harbors a cult of the self: the marquise is thatgoddess.Late Romantic Balzac extends Rousseau’s and Sade’s philosophizing of sex. In TheGirl with the Golden Eyes, brother and sister prove kinship through intercoursewith the same woman. A sex act is the ritual medium of identity. Functioningabstractly, stripped of emotion, the act is a western instrument ofself-knowledge. The girl with the golden eyes is only a boundary herm where twonationals meet. The knowledge gained by the fraternal doubles from theircollaborative sex-experience benefits no one. It is ethically dissipated by theRomantic separation of self from society. Unlike Shakespeare’s twins, thesedoubles do not affiliate but immediately diverge: sister flatly tells brother,“We shall never meet again.” Each returns to amoral Sadean solitude. TheRenaissance twins arouse and satisfy multiple erotic responses, but the Romantictwins solipsistically focus on and obliterate the same girl, in an incestuouscul-de-sac.For their mutual recognition, brother and sister return to their poetic originsin the Byronic seraglio, a Delphic omphalos-spot. Byron is the progenitor of TheGirl with the Golden Eyes both inside and outside the text. I suspect, in fact,that the marquise sojourns in London for most of the story because she is takingtransfusions from English Romantic imagination. Her lesbianism comes fromByron’s sultana, Latouche’s Camille, and notorious sophisticates like GeorgeSand. The story ends with the new Decadent cynicism, a revival ofeighteenth-century libertinage. De Marsay, promenading, dismisses a query aboutthe girl with the golden eyes: she is dead, he says, of “a chest ailment.” Inother words, she had a heart. Rousseau’s erotic lyricism is gone. Theblood-drenched boudoir of The Girl with the Golden Eyes encapsulates the turnfrom High to Late Romanticism, with its artificiality, enslavement, andcorruption.Balzac, began writing Seraphita (December 1833—November 1835) before completingThe Girl with the Golden Eyes. I view the two as morally opposite halves of asingle sexual idea. One is the Inferno of The Human Comedy, the other theParadiso. Seraphita is unusual for Balzac in taking place outside France, inScandinavia, home of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, whose ideasoverwhelm the narrative. Norway’s icy whiteness allows Balzac to achievedazzling Apollonian effects like Spenser’s. Probably due to its occultism,Seraphita was Yeats’s favorite Balzac work.A man and woman, Wilfrid and Minna, fall in love with Seraphita, whom heperceives as female and she as male. The indeterminacy of gender is sustainedthroughout the novella. Seraphita belongs to my category of androgyne asApollonian angel. Like Wordsworth and Shelley, Balzac attempts a Romanticseraphicization, the most elaborate in literature. Wilfrid and Minna willwitness Seraphita’s transfiguration into a real seraph, welcomed by celestialhosts. Seraphita is the French Epipsychidion.In Part One, “Seraphitus,” we see the angel in his masculine phase. He is anadolescent ephebe of “brilliant splendor,” his eyes blazing with solar fire. Hisnorthland is a visionary realm glittering with “flashes of the ephemeraldiamonds produced by the crystallized surface of the snow and ice.”15[ch25_notes.html#ch15note15a] Character and climate are saturated withApollonian light. Descending the mountain to reenter society, Seraphitus turnsinto Seraphita. Spiritual retraction, sexual transformation: the figure softens;the voice turns treble. Spenser’s switch of sexual perspective is a quickjump-cut, but Balzac’s is a long gliding declension, an Ovidian metamorphosis,slow and magical. Balzac cleverly anchors the novella to a homely group ofsometimes tedious humans. Minna, for example, like Goethe’s Charlotte, is ofconspicuously average intelligence. These people function as rhetoricallightning rods, absorbing the electric charge generated by charismaticSeraphita. They stabilize the naturalism of the text and prevent it from turninginto allegory.Seraphitus rejects Minna’s advances: sex is “too gross” or material. LikeLatouche’s Camille, he calls himself monster and exile, a Romantic outcast. Thehermaphrodite, too complete, is imprisoned in solitude. Like Spenser’sBelphoebe, he/she flees the contamination of lesser beings. Nine-year-oldSeraphita could sit in church only when separated from others: “If this space isnot left about her, she is ill.” Like Goethe’s Mignon, Seraphita has an excessof nervous intensity. She is self-sequestered in the magic circle of ritualpurity, a shamanistic quarantine. Like Byron’s Manfred, Seraphitus declares, “Ilive by myself and for myself.” Late Romantic knowledge presses on him: “Likethe debauched Emperors of Pagan Rome, I am disgusted with all things.” He hasthe paradoxical Decadent conflation of satiety with virginity.In Part One we saw Seraphitus from the point of view of enamoured Minna. In PartTwo, “Seraphita,” we take the point of view of enamoured Wilfrid, who thinks theangel female. Seraphitus denied he was a man. Now Seraphita denies she is awoman. Seraphita always positions herself to the other side of whatever genderis projected onto her. These are the chaste evasions of the Apollonianandrogyne, like Belphoebe “swerving back” from lustful clutches. Beloved, likeRosalind, by both man and woman, Seraphita finds a unique Romantic solution. Shedeclares Wilfrid and Minna “one being,” simultaneously “a brother or a sister”to her. So let this brother and sister marry each other! The story ends with theunion of the two, so little acquainted that up to this point they have addressedeach other with the formal vous. Their marriage is a Romantic coalescence ofdoubles, the pattern of Byron’s Manfred and Sardanapalus. Seraphita playsShakespeare’s Hymen, a numinous nuptial spirit. The finale is an ascension of agod, leaving his disciples behind to perpetuate his cult. Wilfrid and Minna as“one being” are divided halves of a Platonic androgyne. Like Shelley’s Witch,Seraphita makes a mirror-image, a hermaphrodite self-portrait. To marry off heradmirers is to fuse two sexual views of one personality. Seraphita performs adaring perceptual experiment and reassembles herself in human form. She replaysEpipsychidion by creating her own incestuous twin.“Who and what are you?” asks Minna, like Shelley pondering Emilia Viviani’sontological status. Wilfrid compares Seraphita to gases, half material, halfspiritual. Occult beings “work magic” on “hapless victims,” reducing them to“wretched serfdom” by “the weight and magnificent sway of a superior nature.”“Penetrated” by Seraphita, Wilfrid suffers Decadent enslavement: “I love her andI hate her!” Her sexual duality plunges him into Catullus’ emotionalambivalence. He has Decadent visions of phosphorescence and narcosis. Seraphitais like opium or the torpedo fish “which electrifies and numbs the fisherman.”The charismatic personality is a vampire, oblivious to human suffering.Part Three, “Seraphita-Seraphitus,” fills in the angel’s genealogy. She seems“conceived by the union of sun and ice,” like the Spenserian “fire and snow” ofShelley’s Hermaphrodite. As the child of Swedenborg’s cousin and “most zealousdisciple,” Baron Seraphitz, Seraphita is an emanation of Swedenborg’s thought.Swedenborg’s relation to Seraphita is like Byron’s to The Girl with the GoldenEyes: both men are eccentric trendsetters and progenitors of androgynes. YoungBalzac, says Félix Longaud, “nourished himself” upon his mother’s Swedenborgcollection.16 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note16a] Seraphita treats Swedenborg halfseriously, half comically. A pastor describes Swedenborg’s work as a “torrent ofcelestial illumination”: “As you read, you must either lose your wits or becomea seer.”Seraphita’s most modern theme is the relativity of perception, also addressed byEmily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights. In a ritual triangulation of the eye, threepeople in a castle courtyard gaze in at Seraphita through the window. She standsenraptured in a glamourous mist, a cult object in a crystal cabinet. Eachvisitor makes a different sexual interpretation: Minna sees a man; Wilfrid andthe pastor see a woman. Enigmatic Seraphita is personality at the vanishingpoint. No speaker seems to hear another, as in Virginia Woolf’s The Waves. Bythe end, bitter dispute about Seraphita’s gender breaks into the open. The storystarts to oscillate surreally, line by line. The sole analogy is Catullus’litany to castrated Attis. Balzac’s manipulations of gender are the most complexin literature. Even Woolf’s Orlando, with its midpoint sexchange, treats itsandrogyne with schematic simplicity, compared to Seraphita’ s flamelikeinterweaving of objective and subjective gender. Much is lost in translation,since Balzac exploits the grammatical ambiguity of Romance languages: Englishmust choose his or her in pronouns, while French can avoid committing itself.Seraphita’s gender wavers, so that Wilfrid and Minna misunderstand each other asthey dream aloud about their entrancing angel.At death and transfiguration, Seraphita becomes “Il”—he or it. She is now a maleseraph and angel (“le Séraphin,” “[le] ange”). The story is organized byverticals which Minna and Wilfrid cannot follow, like Shelley falling back fromafflatus. Talky Seraphita passes into Apollonian silence, beyond language.Dematerializing, she sublimates self and text. I think her frailty and terminaletherealization come from Goethe’s Mignon, who turns angel and dies. Balzac’sheroine takes to her bed to give birth to herself. She clones a perfectandrogyne, her artistic superself, as in Cellini’s couvade. The Perseus is aRenaissance triumph of aggressive practicality, matter subdued to will.Seraphita advances by Romantic purification of consciousness. Cellini’s sagaends with artist and art work separated by social distance. But Balzac’sRomantic saga ends with self and work united. The self is the work of art,another Romantic coalescence of doubles.Seraphita as symbol of perfected man may be influenced by social theorists likeBallanche and Saint-Simon, who identified the androgyne with liberal reform anduniversal brotherhood.17 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note17a] The optimistic androgyneis the only nineteenth-century example of the public (rather than personalistic)androgyne of the Renaissance kind. Setting his tale in 1800, Balzac (born 1799)suggests that his era breaks with the past through Seraphita’s sexualrevelation. This is like Freud’s postdating the first edition of TheInterpretation of Dreams to inaugurate the twentieth century and give it arevolutionary Freudian character.The Girl with the Golden Eyes and Seraphita answer each other, inverting theirhermaphrodite stars. In the amoral Girl, with its Decadent closure, twoandrogynes are murderously aligned toward a conventional center. In the moralSeraphita, with its space and height, two conventional genders are lovinglyaligned toward a median hermaphrodite. The Girl with the Golden Eyes is infusedwith southern sexual passion, recreated in the marquise’s opulent boudoir.Seraphita chills sex and gender on Nordic ice. Body vs. mind, sensuality vs.abstraction: like D. H. Lawrence, Balzac diagrams the European cultural schizophrenia. Nature is in bondage to the seraph. The ice cracks and nature revivesonly when Seraphita weakens and dies. Balzac’s two tales check and correct eachother in a circular pattern of sex and geography.Androgynous personae appear everywhere in The Human Comedy. In Balzac’s majorcharacter triad, the girlishly beautiful Eugène de Rastignac and Lucien deRubempré are enslaved by the Machiavellian master criminal, Vautrin. Thetranssexual similes applied to Eugène are like a violet tincture making hisfeminine narcissism visible to the reader’s eye. Lucien apes the dandy DeMarsay, just as Wilde’s Dorian Gray will ape Lord Henry Wotton, whose moralseduction of Dorian recalls Vautrin’s of Lucien. Lucien has womanly hands, feet,and hips, a Greek profile, cheeks of “silky down” and “golden-white temples” of“Olympian suavity.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note18a] “Diabolic” Vautrin is amasculine hierarch attended by two effeminate angels. By homoerotic magnetism,he draws Eugène and Lucien into the intimate sanctum of his amoralconsciousness, where is spread the delusive satanic banquet of wealth and power.One of Balzac’s major female androgynes, based on George Sand, is the novelistFélicité des Touches, whom Balzac calls “the illustrious hermaphrodite” becauseof her masculine genius.19 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note19a] Her pen name, CamilleMaupin, is a coalition of respectful references to Latouche and Gautier. Theheroine of Cousin Bette (1846) is an androgyne in a different mode, thechthonian. She is “a primitive peasant” with a “masculine stiff temperament,”energized by her emotional proximity to nature. Her favorite moods are “hate andvengeance uncompromising, as they are known in Italy, Spain, and the East,”regions “bathed by the sun.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch15note20a] Hence Bette issavage sister to the Spanish marquise of The Girl with the Golden Eyes. CelibateBette has a touch of the marquise’s lesbianism. Her “love of power” is awakenedby a weak-willed Polish artist, Count Wenceslas Steinbock, “a pale, fair youngman.” “Nature had made a mistake,” says Balzac, “in assigning their sexes.”Their relation of dominance and submission is modelled on George Sand’s affairswith the delicate Chopin and Alfred de Musset.Bette turns “dictatorial” Muse, making the dreamy artist productive. When hemarries and becomes sexually active, his work fails and halts. Balzac thoughtcelibacy crucial for artistic and intellectual achievement, and he remainedcelibate for most of the years of work on the gargantuan Human Comedy. Bette’sprimitivistic materiality jolts her protégé. She fructifies him and makes himpotent as an artist, but only by inhibiting him sexually. When he exchangessadomasochistic servitude for personal happiness, he loses his artisticidentity. Like Keats’s Apollo, he is roused from melancholic torpor by a brutefemale titan. Bette’s mental and physical force comes from her virginity, whichgives her “a diabolical strength or the black magic of the Will.” Her hardnessof personality is like that of Spenser’s radiant characters of sharp Apolloniancontour. Chastity is normally an anti-chthonian strategy, but Balzac strangelycombines it with chthonian power. Bette becomes “a black diamond,” “a ByzantineVirgin” whose “erect hieratic carriage” recalls the gods of Egyptian sculpture.She is “walking granite, basalt, porphyry.” Condensing herself into anApollonian objet d’art, she mimics society in order to penetrate and derange it.Seraphita’s Apollonian ice-crystals become Cousin Bette’s amoral black diamond.Bette’s primal aggression darkens the conceptual western eye. Though she belongsto a social novel, she resonates with the archetypal, because she is a willfulRomantic androgyne.Balzac aspired to aristocracy, ennobling himself by adding a “de” to his name.There may be wishful identification in his Henri de Marsay, debonair arbiter ofParisian fashion. We should group De Marsay with Eugène and Lucien as sexualpersonae. Balzac’s charismatic half-feminine epheboi represent what theApollonian Amazons Belphoebe and Britomart did for Spenser. They are visionaryideograms of aristocracy, of the cold beauty of rank and breeding. Balzac, acentaurian mesomorph, projects these elegant ectomorphs as creatures of ahierarchic dream. The ill-fated Lucien and Wenceslas seem to have the “artistic”temperament, sensitive and impressionable. But they are not Balzacian.Ironically, Balzac’s coarse female androgynes are closer to him in body andmind. Cousin Bette has his muscular force and tenacity, and to her he gives hisreal-life theory of conservation of energy through sexual renunciation. Hencethese many androgynes are Balzac’s self-portraits, mirroring each other like theperceptual halves of Seraphitus/Seraphita. The male androgyne is fantasy, thefemale androgyne reality."},{"pageContent":"16CULTS OF SEX AND BEAUTYGautier, Baudelaire, and HuysmansThe begetter of French and English Decadence is Théophile Gautier, who startedhis career as a painter. He creates aestheticism, the neopagan worship ofbeauty. Gautier’s liberation and ritualization of the eye turn Romanticism fromchthonian to Apollonian, putting it in the main line of western hierarchismbeginning in Egypt and Greece. Gautier deeply influenced, by their ownadmission, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Mallarmé, and Swinburne and is thereforepowerfully present in Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde. As the librettist of Giselleand The Spectre of the Rose, he also contributed to dance history. Criticism’sneglect of Gautier may be due to prudery after the fall of Wilde, but it alsoreflects indifference to the sensuality of art. Analysis of style is still animperfect science. Style, primary in Gautier, is the music of sexual personae.Gautier’s masterpiece is Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835), for Sainte-Beuve a“Bible” of Romanticism. It was Balzac’s favorite book during an importantcreative period. Baudelaire called it a “hymn to Beauty” and said he had a“nervous convulsion” upon encountering Gautier’s “undulating and glossy” style.1[ch25_notes.html#ch16note1a] Maupin is ruled by a new Rosalind. Not since theRenaissance Amazons had there been a bolder, more athletic or charismaticheroine.Piqued by a magazine article, Gautier undertook a historical romance onMadeleine de Maupin d’Aubigny, a bisexual actress and transvestite of theseventeenth century. However, says René Jasinski, Maupin’s eyes, hair, figure,and “virile spirit” belong to George Sand.2 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note2a] Insexual structure, the novel resembles Seraphita: a man and woman are enamouredof an androgyne, who rejects both admirers and, before disappearing forever,commands them to unite in his/her name. But the two works were writtensimultaneously (1833–35), and neither could have influenced the other. Balzacand Gautier did not meet until after the publication of Mademoiselle de Maupin,which so impressed Balzac that he sought an introduction to its author, thestart of a lifelong friendship. The mysterious similarity is due to the stories’indebtedness to Latouche’s Fragoletta and to the historical shift from High toLate Romanticism.Though the first part, epistolary musings by a melancholy Romantic male, mayhave been written earlier, Maupin is unified by its sexual problematics and thenew theme of aestheticism. A male androgyne, the aesthete D’Albert, is destinedto be obsessed by a great female androgyne. His opening monologue provides thepsychosexual context from which Maupin forcibly emerges, sweeping up the novelin a fictive energy that does not flag till the end. Like Faust, Maupinexperiments with genres. Reacting to its ambiguous multiplicity, Baudelairespeaks of it as novel, tale, tableau, reverie. Prose rises dreamily to poetry,something increasingly evident in Gautier’s later work. John Porter Houstoncalls Maupin the ancestor of the modern lyrical novel.3[ch25_notes.html#ch16note3a] It incorporates letters, narrative, dramaticdialogue, even an essay—the infamous preface, first manifesto of aestheticism.Gautier attacks bourgeois values and asserts art has neither social utility normoral content. Beauty alone is art’s mission. The preface is not, as oftenclaimed, disconnected from the story. The novel sets forth the premise ofbeauty, absent from modern culture, then illustrates it in the dazzling form ofMademoiselle de Maupin. Gautier, with Latouche, forges the Decadent fusionbetween sexual ambiguity and the aesthetic which will hold throughPre-Raphaelitism, Art Nouveau, and Symbolism all the way to Art Deco and Erté.Depressed D’Albert is a sensitive sufferer like Chateaubriand’s René, who caughthis mal du siècle from Goethe’s Werther. But D’Albert has the first fullydeveloped Late Romantic consciousness. I spoke of High Romanticism’s oppressiveself-consciousness, of which Shelley’s confrontation with his spectre is amasque or allegory. Late Romanticism relieves this oppressiveness by a strategyof sophistication. D’Albert’s Romantic travails have a new air of detachment.There is a witty commenting upon the self, as if from a spectator’s distance.High Romantic solipsism becomes Late Romantic sequestration, not of the object(as in Balzac) but of the subject. Late Romantic consciousness, severed fromnature, makes art and therefore the eye its sole mode of knowledge. Thisconnoisseurship of self-cultivation is alien to all High Romantics except Byron.Byron’s aristocratic irony may be a primary source of French Late Romanticism.His breezy humor is everywhere in Gautier.D’Albert is Rousseau’s man of sensibility, but Rousseau’s disciples did notcourt the eyes of a public theater. D’Albert is a dandy, dawdling and blasé. Hewears rich fabrics (like Gautier) and curls his hair to antagonize theconventional, who calls him effeminate. As with Goethe’s epicene Paris, womenmay be attracted by what disgusts men: Balzac’s preening De Marsay says, “Womenlove fops.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note4a] Maupin complains about men’scoarseness and clumsiness, erotic disabilities. For Gautier and the Decadents,masculinity is unaesthetic. The male must be hermaphrodized for love. InSpenser’s rude Artegall, similarly transformed, Renaissance action is mademoral. But in the aesthete, action is disarmed to become beautiful.D’Albert is “more like an actor than a man,” escaping the prison of sex througha mummery of personae. He fantasizes about changing sex, like Teiresias.Finally, he embarks on a Platonic quest. Like Shelley, D’Albert dreams of andthen brings into being an “imaginary woman,” the embodiment of “abstractbeauty.” The High Romantic master principle is imagination, a dynamic process bywhich the mind plays upon reality. The French Late Romantic principle is art,largely as static painting and sculpture. Prerevolutionary French aristocraticand religious art was far more ornate than anything in England. FrenchRomanticism revived the austerity of Gothic, to which Gautier was hostile.D’Albert makes a countermovement toward Greek classicism, the Apollonianassumptions of Italian Renaissance art followed by Jacques-Louis David. Hesubscribes to Greek idealism: “I worship beauty of form above all things; beautyis to me visible divinity.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note5a] As in Plato, thebeautiful person is a god. Gautier told the Goncourts, “My whole distinction isthat I am a man for whom the visible world exists.”Mademoiselle de Maupin demonstrates how the aesthete’s infatuation with thevisible is at the expense of the invisible or ethical. The aesthete is animmoralist. D’Albert rejects “the mortification of matter which is the essenceof Christianity.” He says, “It is a real torture to me to see ugly things orugly persons.” Since externals are all-important, he avoids old people, “becausethey are wrinkled and deformed.” Here are the origins of Wilde’s aesthetic, withits arrogant exclusiveness. The old or ugly are valueless to the poet of thevisible world. D’Albert makes the high Greek claim, “What is physicallybeautiful is good, all that is ugly is evil.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note6a] TheApollonian is always cruel. Only Dionysus gives empathy. Aestheticism invests inart objects the affect withdrawn from persons. D’Albert judges women as if theywere statues and loves statues as if they were women. Emotion is ritualized andobjectified.Condescending toward real women because of their fleshly imperfections, D’Albertis stunned by Mademoiselle de Maupin, who breaks all rules. She is disguised asa cavalier, so beautiful to him that he thinks he is turning homosexual. For thefirst time, he experiences electrifying erotic submission to a living person,fulfillment of his aesthetic prophecy. The same thing happens to Balzac’sSarrasine. Maupin is a materialization of Gautier’s theory of ideal beauty, justas Balzac’s Seraphita is an emanation of Swedenborg’s thought.Gautier begins to play games with the reader. In Spenser’s switch of sexualperspective, Maupin’s true sex would be revealed once we saw her from the publicpoint of view. But Gautier, like Balzac, is interested in Romantic ambiguity forits own sake. He pretends to know as little as we about the cavalier’s gender.Maupin enters as “he” and remains “he” for many chapters. Her relations with herpage, another girl in disguise, are physically affectionate. Gautier seduces thereader into a strange twilit bower of sexual uncertainty. As in The FaerieQueene, there’s lots of smooth white flesh half-seen through disarrayedgarments. The reader is being manipulated and aroused, his or her own ordinarysexual responses confused. Maupin herself sways back and forth. When Rosette,D’Albert’s mistress, confesses her passion for her, Maupin replies, “I haveoften wished to be able to love you, at least in the way that you would like;but there is an insurmountable obstacle between us which I cannot explain toyou.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note7a] Note Gautier’s alteration of Shakespeare:the transvestite woman does not merely discourage the advances of her femaleadmirer but for the first time admits to crossing in imagination over the sexualbarrier. Gautier, post-Rousseau, gives his heroine a naturalistic sexualidentity, fluctuating unpredictably with changing circumstance.When the page is knocked cold from his horse, Rosette opens his coat and shirt.This imitates Byron’s scene of discovery in “Lara,” where the bosom of swooningGulnare, disguised as a boy, is exposed by bystanders. Gautier dwells on andelongates the moment of seeing. Rosette is unhappy with what she finds, “around, polished ivory bosom … delicious to see, and more delicious to kiss.”8[ch25_notes.html#ch16note8a] Gautier’s arch tone has that connoisseurship whichI identify as distinctively Late Romantic. The sensuous is scrupulously observedbut never possessed. Aesthetic distance is ingeniously preserved between eye andobject. Eroticism is inflamed by the voyeuristic succession of observers: gazingat the unconscious, seminude object are the astonished Rosette, behind her thelascivious Gautier, and behind him the Peeping Tom reader. Gautier createsritual and theology of the new religion of art. The passive person turned artwork is invaded and possessed by the aggressive western eye. The eye has allrights, the object none. As in Sade, the dominant knower makes enormoushierarchic claims. Western seeing, I maintain, is innately fascistic and amoral.Each narrative shift in Maupin brings further erotic complication. Disturbinglyattracted to the cavalier, D’Albert defends homosexuality with ancientprecedents. Roman poetry is a “monstrous seraglio” of beautiful boys, repugnantto Christianity. He declares, “Christ has not come for me; I am as much pagan aswere Alcibiades and Phidias.” He has a sharp-edged Apollonian vision of Athens:“Never mist or vapour, never anything uncertain or wavering. My sky has noclouds, or if there be any, they are solid chisel-carved clouds, formed with themarble fragments fallen from the statue of Jupiter.” The mountains have“sharpcut ridges,” every contour fine and clear. “There is no room for thesoftness and dreaming of Christian art…. Christ has wrapped the world in hisshroud…. The palpable world is dead.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note9a] The Greekeye, sculpting the world with high Apollonian articulation, opposes the cloudsof Christian inwardness, northern Europe’s gloomy fogs. Like Balzac, Gautiertakes the sunlit Mediterranean point of view. D’Albert says, “Correctness ofform is virtue”—which could serve as an epigraph to the Apollonian FaerieQueene. Gautier’s dialectic of pagan visualization vs. misty Christianemotionalism is surely the distant source, via Pater, of Yeats’s depiction ofChristianity as “a fabulous, formless darkness” (“Two Songs from a Play”).Condemning Christian hostility to physical beauty, Gautier inventsaestheticism’s radical exaltation of outer over inner, the literalization ofwhich is to bring down Oscar Wilde.D’Albert argues that the Madonna symbolizes the Christian love of woman, whosupplants the Greco-Roman androgyne. He celebrates homosexual Athens’idealization of “adolescent beauty.” The Hermaphrodite, Maupin’s precursor, was“one of the sweetest creations of Pagan genius”:To an exclusive worshipper of form, can there be a more delightful uncertaintythan that into which you are thrown by the sight of the back, the ambiguousloins, and the strong, delicate legs, which you are doubtful whether toattribute to Mercury ready to take his flight or to Diana coming forth from thebath? … In the whole habit of the body there is something cloudy and undecidedwhich it is impossible to describe, and which possesses quite a peculiarattraction.10 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note10a]Gautier has broken his own rules. Hastily joining two phases of Greek art, hereverses himself. Idealized adolescence was a high classic theme; the overtHermaphrodite flourished in the sensationalistic Hellenistic era. This chapterof Maupin asserts the Apollonian and then refutes it in the Hermaphrodite, whomGautier has surely taken from the Naples Museum episode of Fragoletta. Headmires the classical for lacking “anything uncertain and wavering” yet admiresthe Hermaphrodite for being “cloudy and undecided.” He is caught unaware in acontradiction which Spenser, equally loyal to Apollonian contour, detected inThe Faerie Queene and fixed by cancelling the “Hermaphrodite stanzas.”Surrendering to the Romantic love of ambiguity, Gautier strays from his Greekideals.Gautier’s poem, “Contralto” (1849), opens with a description of the “SleepingHermaphrodite.” Ten stanzas pass before we realize the statue is a visionoverwhelming the poet as he listens spellbound to a woman singer with a huskycontralto voice, midway between male and female. The poem was inspired byErnesta Grisi, Gautier’s companion and mother of his children. The “enigmaticstatue” has a “disturbing beauty.” “Is it a young man? is it a woman?” Gautierasks Rousseau’s question of sexual identity. Hanging back in fascinatedsuspension, the spectators need Keats’s negative capability. Gender is conundrumand public spectacle. Men think one thing, women another, as in Seraphita’srelativity of sexual perception.The Hermaphrodite, an “ardent chimera” or “charming monster” of “accursedbeauty,” is alienated from the multitude, like Coleridge’s poet. Bothprovocative and reclusive, it is a ritual cult-object to which gifts arebrought. The Hermaphrodite is separated from society and nature. It is a LateRomantic freak, symbol of the impossible. “Dream of poet and artist,” “supremeeffort of art and pleasure,” it is an artificial sex. Its “multiple beauty”unites the art object’s sexual duality with the multiplicity of response artgenerates in its audience. Art forms transpose, sculpture changing to music;reverie evaporates matter to sound. Gautier calls the contralto both Romeo andJuliet and compares her to Byron’s transvestite Gulnare and virile epic heroes.She is autoerotic, with the power of self-fecundation. Transfixed by a singingandrogyne, the poet is like Sarrasine before Zambinella. In Ernesta Grisi,Gautier seems to have procured his own resident castrato. Stars like MarleneDietrich, Barbara Stanwyck, and Lauren Bacall demonstrate the eerieness of thebeautiful woman with an alto voice, charismatically attracting both sexes.D’Albert’s ode to the Hermaphrodite establishes Maupin’s status as a living artobject discovered by a Late Romantic connoisseur. Now we enter her mind and hearher voice. No longer a remote archetype, she becomes a modern woman sick of“conventional masks, conventional opinions and conventional modes of speech,”antagonizing the sexes.11 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note11a] The historical Maupinwas an expert fencer who killed many men.12 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note12a]Gautier’s athletic heroine adopts male costume to study social reality up close.As a wandering female transvestite, she is influenced by both Rosalind andMignon. Goethe’s characters perform Hamlet at the climax of their novel;Gautier’s characters perform As You Like It, their ultimate Renaissance source.At the rehearsal, where Maupin appears as Rosalind in woman’s clothes, the novelfor the first time stops calling its heroine “he.” Lit by a mysterious radiance,she appears in a doorway and holds position, framed like a painting. The otherscry out and applaud. Like “Contralto” ‘s Hermaphrodite, she is the art object onpublic display, fusing genres. D’Albert’s Platonic quest for ideal beauty isceremonially consummated. Maupin’s transfiguring “floods of white light” are theby-product of her alteration of gender-states. Her Apollonian glamour isGautier’s version of Shakespeare’s ghostly Hymen. Her entrance is an epiphany ofhermaphrodite authority. She stuns the other characters by sudden hierarchicassertion, dominating the plane of eye-contact and subordinating the audience toher will.Sexual confusion is not resolved by Maupin publicly acknowledging her truegender. Instead we double backward to hear her spiritual autobiography, recordedin letters. Her lesbian flirtation is far more blatant than Rosalind’s. Gautierstages feverish boudoir scenes where Rosette throws herself at the disguisedMaupin, their bodies voluptuously intertwining like Salmacis and Hermaphroditus.Unlike Rosalind, Maupin is in real doubt about her gender. She claims shebelongs to “a third, distinct sex, which as yet has no name,” an idea to returnin the homosexual polemicists John Addington Symonds and Radclyffe Hall. In thethird sex, “the sex of the soul does not at all correspond with that of thebody.”13 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note13a] So nature has erred. Maupin’s abnormalityis not relative but absolute. No society could satisfy her. Following Rousseau,she ponders her sexual identity. Like “Contralto”’s Hermaphrodite, she has anaccursed beauty alienating her from both sexes. She must remain alone,Romantically autonomous.Like Balzac’s marquise, Maupin is a female aesthete, drawn to women as “thepossessors of beauty.” Gautier maliciously vilifies his own sex. Men, saysMaupin, are smelly, misshapen, bestial. Masculinity is grossly material. Hencethe pursuit of beauty is always a flight from the masculine. Forced, during oneof Rosette’s assaults, to contemplate the female bosom at close quarters, Maupinmakes silent aesthetic judgments, in which mischievous Gautier clearly concurs.Rosette’s rounded “satin flesh” is “enchantingly delicate and transparent intone,” and so on.14 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note14a] Here again is Gautier’sritualized voyeurism, that series of attentive observers, of which we are thelast in line. He creates the Late Romantic eye, erotic, aggressive, andknowledgeable but ever-distant.Maupin preserves the artist’s detachment from primary experience. She samplesbut will not commit. In this modern transvestite comedy, overt sex replaces theRenaissance wedding scene. The novel ends with the virgin warrior Maupin tastingheterosexuality and homosexuality in a single night, passing noncommittally fromD’Albert’s bed to Rosette’s and then disappearing at dawn. She leavesinstructions, like Seraphita, for her male and female admirers to mate with eachother as a rite of memory in her name. Sexual initiation shows her the banalityof the ideal made real. She is overcome by disillusion, a major theme ofnineteenth-century novels. Maupin’s recoil from sex is Decadent, though thenovel is High Romantic in tone. There is no Decadent closure, for example. Theheroine can still ride off into the woods at the end of the story. Though art ispreferred to nature, nature remains airy and lyrical. Unlike Rosalind, Maupinmakes a choice for self rather than community and preserves her androgyny beyondthe narrative frame. She marries herself, withdrawing her energy from societyand reinvesting it in her own imagination. The abrupt finale is unique: anautoerotic elopement.Mademoiselle de Maupin is one of the last literary examples of the womandisguised in men’s clothing, a Renaissance motif fading in the nineteenthcentury, as women leave home to work in factory and office. When film picks upthe theme, the transvestism is merely titillating. The practicality of Rosalindand Maupin’s male dress is gone. The perilous world of adventure dwindles to thestage of a Berlin cabaret. Dietrich’s transvestism in Josef von Sternberg’sThirties films is a Hollywood transplant of Weimar perversity, a survival offin-de-siècle Decadence. Few transvestite films address serious psychologicaland artistic issues. In Robert Aldrich’s The Legend of Lylah Clare (1968), anactress (Kim Novak) is possessed by a dead, Dietrich-like movie queen. As inMaupin, transvestism causes sexual error. A fatal accident is shown threedifferent ways, until we see that the raffish hoodlum manhandling Lylah Clare(herself surreally speaking and laughing in a male voice) is a lesbian indisguise. The film demonstrates the contraction of the transvestite theme sincethe Renaissance. Now cross-dressing is just an aphrodisiac game in a tawdryurban milieu. Hollywood is as full of predators as the Forest of Arden (the filmends allegorically, with a dog-food commercial degenerating into wolfish chaos),but the transvestism is not imagined as a defense against them.The more picaresque the genre, the more utilitarian the female transvestism.Hence Katharine Hepburn’s boy-disguises in the strident Sylvia Scarlett (1936).There is always an erotic tinge to a woman dressed as a man. A man in femaleclothing is usually shown as comic or neurotic, because of his deviance from themasculine. This reverses the facts of transvestism in real life. Femaletransvestism in its strict sense, says Robert J. Stoller, is “a condition thatmay not exist.” As for butch lesbians dressing in men’s clothing, “Neither theynor other women have a fetishistic relationship to male apparel: they do notbecome sexually excited by such objects.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note15a] Maletransvestites are not only sexually stimulated by female clothing but mayrequire it for orgasm, as with the surprising number of heterosexual men whosecretly dress up in their wives’ lingerie. Women are not sexualconceptualizers, just as they are not lust-murderers. For women, male clothingmeans social freedom and authority. For men, female clothing is religious orcultic. It is the costume of the mother, with whom the son unites by ritualimpersonation, like priests of Cybele. The female transvestite seeks merely topass. Do not gaze at her too long, for her disguise is fragile. But the maletransvestite is his own best voyeur, exploiting his internalized eye for maximumexcitement. The female transvestite arouses others, not herself.Semitransvestism is a musical comedy convention: Dietrich, Judy Garland, andShirley MacLaine combine high heels and net stockings with top hat and tails.The style is nineteenth-century, probably originating in the theatrical personaeof sadomasochistic prostitution, a specialty of English taste satisfied inParis. Its element of hierarchical formality is crucial.A film of Mademoiselle de Maupin should have been made in the Thirties, the onedecade that could have caught its sexual mystery and glamour. Parker Tyler had“an uncommunicated obsession” that Garbo play Maupin.16[ch25_notes.html#ch16note16a] The transvestite Queen Christina, which shecommissioned, shows that Garbo had the tall, commanding figure and cold reservefor the role. Diana Rigg, in her Avengers period, would have been the idealMaupin. Rigg has Maupin’s verbal energy, unlike the morose, laconic Garbo.Gautier’s novel was the first detailed analysis of irresolution of gender. Thehermaphrodite had appeared throughout literature and art since antiquity, butthis was the first time it was given a turbulent inner life. Is Maupin, for allher force and vitality, an ideal female persona? She is a transition from theHigh Romantic to the Decadent androgyne, glaringly absent from feministapologias for androgyny. Would universal androgyny really improve relationsbetween the sexes? Mademoiselle de Maupin demonstrates the facile optimism ofsuch a view. Gautier correctly shows hermaphroditism as asocial, becauseautarchic. His physically and spiritually perfect heroine secedes from humanrelationships and collective values. Sex itself is dispensed with. Vanishinginto the distance, Maupin defiantly returns to that chastity symbolizing heruncompromising definitiveness of personality.Gautier’s artistic development capsulizes the shift from High to LateRomanticism. His story A Night with Cleopatra follows Mademoiselle de Maupin byonly three years, yet there has been a stunning transformation in style andsexual personae. The aesthete Gautier has become a Decadent. He must by now haveread Balzac’s The Girl with the Golden Eyes. Had he also read Sade? Gautier’sruling androgyne is no longer virginal Rosalind of the greenwood but an Orientaldespot, cruel and sensual. Cleopatra, bored and dangerous, is the first exoticheterosexual femme fatale of the Decadence. The androgyne has changed becausenature has changed.The air is still and dead. The noon sun discharges “leaden arrows.” A dazzling“hard light” streams down “in torrents of flame,” producing “a blazing reddishhaze.” Cleopatra complains:This Egypt destroys and crushes me…. Never a cloud! never a shadow, and for everthis red, dripping sun which stares like the eye of a Cyclops! … From theenflamed eyeball of this sky of bronze has never yet fallen a single tear on thedesolation of the earth; it is a huge tombstone, a dome of a necropolis, a skydead and dried up like the mummies it covers! it weighs on my shoulders like atoo heavy coat! it irks me and distresses me; it seems to me as if I could notrise to my full height without bruising my forehead against it…. Imaginationhere produces nothing but monstrous chimaeras and inordinate monuments; thissort of architecture and art terrifies me; these colossi, whose limbs fixed instone condemn them to rest eternally seated with their hands on their knees,tire me with their stupid immobility; they obsess my eyes and my horizon.17[ch25_notes.html#ch16note17a]This is one of the supreme examples of Decadent closure. The sky is no longerthe gate of the Romantic infinite but a bronze dome sealing up space. The worldis a desert, seared by the glaring, hostile sun. Architecture is menacing andsurreal, anticipating Baudelaire’s night Paris. Movement is impossible, yeteveryone is exhausted because the object-world presses so heavily. Making “amighty effort” in her “enormous fatigue,” Cleopatra manages to walk thirty stepsto her bath. Byron and Delacroix’s Orient has lost its energy because the humanis cut off from nature, from which Rousseau and Wordsworth expected so much.Shakespeare’s fertile Egypt is now a stone tomb heaped with frozen art objects.This Egypt is the imprisoner, not the liberator of European imagination.Thus Maupin’s airy High Romantic nature has become louring Late Romantic nature.The androgyne shifts modes: enslaved by nature, Cleopatra becomes a Sadeansexual enslaver. Gautier’s new style is also an enslaver, violentlysubordinating literature to the visual arts. In long, endless sentences, personor panorama is described in crisp pictorial detail, an avalanche of sensoryimages which astonish but, like Egyptian nature, finally oppress. Gautier’sdescriptions, dismissed as trivial or lifeless, may have been chief cause of hisloss of reputation. But by them he creates Decadent nature, an inorganic realmof art works rather than vegetation.In A Night with Cleopatra, the painter Gautier seeks a literary language forcolor. The Nile banks are “salmon,” with “greenish clay, reddish ochre, tufarock of a floury white.” There are slopes of “rosecolored marble,” gaping with“black mouths” of quarries. An Egyptian sunset is violet, azure, lilac, blue,rose, red, pale lemon, turquoise. Gautier constantly halts the story forscrutiny of form, surface, ornament. His frustration of plot is a development ofRomanticism’s withdrawal from masculine action. It looks forward to modernavant-garde narrative, where it is quite permissible and even desirable fornothing whatever to happen. But we sense in Gautier the cold immobility of theobject so meticulously dissected, as if by autopsy. Since he dwells so much onthe external, there is no one to identify with. The treatment of persons as artobjects is present as an ambition in Maupin but is not technically realizeduntil A Night with Cleopatra. The admirer of Gautier is not repelled by hisdehumanizations but entranced by his poetic virtuosity of ritualizeddescription. His delicate modulations of color are Late Romantic ideas,replacing High Romantic emotion.Cleopatra, subjected to Gautier’s description, disintegrates. There goes anostril, a lip, an eyebrow, a chin! We are too close, like Gulliver straddlingthe nipple of the giantess. Gautier’s eye is invasive, disrupting point of view.The Petrarchan blazon similarly dismembered the beloved. Gautier invents theDecadent blazon or anatomy, a catalog of exquisitely documented parts dissolvingthe whole. Literary energy is absorbed by nouns and their adjectives, multipliedlike ceremonial epithets. There are few verbs in Gautier. Everything floats inapposition. This is the source of Pater’s style, which radically deactivates theverb. Gautier formalizes Romantic passivity, laying the world flat against apicture plane. In A Night with Cleopatra, the eye sees everything. The eyebecomes its own prison. The heavy domed sky is the eye, choking upon its ownexcess of perception.Decadence is a disease of the western eye. It is an intensification of thevoyeurism latent in all art. The pictorial itemizations of A Night withCleopatra coerce the eye and make the reader a connoisseur, forced to assist ina despiritualization of reality. Gautier is the progenitor of Roger Fry’s arttheory of “significant form.” The Decadent exaltation of the part follows fromthe rejection of moral content, for are not ethics the subordination of selfishpart to social whole? Remember the Decadent climax of The Girl with the GoldenEyes, where the murderous marquise appears first as a foot, a part, and even aspart of that, an instep. I think Gautier absorbed this detail and expanded itinto an entire story, The Mummy’s Foot (1840).Browsing in an antiquities shop, an aesthete purchases a mummy’s foot to use asa paperweight. The foot, minutely described, is artistically so perfect that hefirst mistakes it for a fragment of a statue. That night, Pharaoh’s daughterturns up to reclaim her foot, which proves unexpectedly churlish. It leaps aboutto elude her and carries on an animated dialogue with her, insisting in ancientCoptic that it is no longer her property. After the aesthete reconciles thedisputants, the foot consents to be rejoined, and princess and foot fly backthrough time to their homeland. I omit the chorus, where mummified cats mew,ibises flap their wings, and African nations chant, “The Princess Hermonthis hasfound her foot again.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note18a]What is the real meaning of this story? The body is treated as an art object, asform stripped of human meaning. Hawked in a shop, the foot is a mere artifact, adetail of décor. The Mummy’s Foot is a parable of Decadent aestheticism in whicha part declares itself independent of the whole. In Gogol’s The Nose (1835), itis the protagonist who suffers a humiliating reduction of appendages, but inGautier it is the art object, the erotically projected image. Gogol’s tale looksforward to Kafka’s Metamorphosis as a nightmare of self-incapacitated male will.Gautier, however, is concerned with the new autonomy of art. The distancebetween eye and object is so vast that the artist is severed from his own work,form severed from content, and part severed from whole. In the Renaissance, theMoses will not walk, despite even Michelangelo’s command. But in LateRomanticism, the art object has so broken down into richly observed parts that afoot, turgid with its own imaginative authority, can flounce away and rudelydecline to return to its owner.The Late Romantic eye is a tyrant, and the act of seeing is erotically inflamed.This may lead to paranoia, as in Cleopatra’s staring eye of the sun. Sexualvoyeurism, sporadic in Maupin, is at the center of Gautier’s King Candaules(1844), a long story based on Herodotus. Nyssia, the Lydian queen, is rumored tohave a double pupil enabling her to see through walls. But strangely, she whosees is seen. The boastful king arranges for his wife to be seen by another man,Gyges. Outraged, she will plot Candaules’ murder. The queen senses Gyges’ eyesupon her by a “lively magnetic susceptibility” of her skin. Feelingcontaminated, she orders ewers of water poured on her, as if by this “lustralablution” she could “efface the stain due to the glances of Gyges.” She rubsherself frantically: “She wished she could have torn away the skin on which therays of his burning eyes seemed to her to have left traces…. Oh, that glance!that glance! It clings to me, enfolds, envelops, and burns me like the poisonedrobe of Nessus; I feel it under my vestments like a flaming tissue which nothingcan detach from my body.’”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note19a]Before and after this compulsive, Lady-Macbeth-like ritual, Nyssia is called a“statue” of perfect beauty. Candaules mistakenly treats as an objet d’art afemme fatale of uncanny occult power. Nyssia has the archaic daemonic eye whichpenetrates and paralyzes. The power of sight is sexual and aggressive. To see isto possess; to be seen is to be raped. Made involuntarily passive beneathanother’s gaze, Nyssia is driven to blood revenge. Unlike Balzac’s girl with thegolden eyes, she can and must recover from a state of erotic facticity. In thisstory, seeing even alters what it touches, lingering like a wraith. Gautierknows western eye-contact is just that, a sensory assault by the questingimperialistic mind.Why this obsession with visual relations in Gautier? High Romanticism, thinkingimagination alone can sustain the universe, is riven with anxieties. An excessof phenomena, no longer ordered by society or religion, floods consciousness.Late Romantic imagination contracts in fatigue, protecting itself by motifs ofclosure. The world collapses into a heap of objects, honored by the Decadencefor their morbid decay. Gautier invents aestheticism as a mode of perceptualcontrol. The lavish, plot-halting passages of A Night with Cleopatra are aritualization of the eye-object relation. A fixed aesthetic distance stems theobliterating influx of phenomena. In Gautier, to see means to keep at adistance. Art structures everything in him, sexual and metaphysical. Gautiercreates Decadent style, freezing word to image to propitiate the pagan eye.Baudelaire’s Flowers of Evil (1857) is dedicated to his “master,” Gautier.Baudelaire translated Poe and hailed him as his second self. Poe’s spiritualfather was the Coleridge of the mystery poems. Thus Coleridge, coming throughPoe to Baudelaire, daemonizes Gautier, with his Byronic breeziness. Baudelaire’snew Decadent tone is haughty and hieratic. His poems are ritualisticconfrontations with the horror of sex and nature, which he analyzes with Sade’scutting rhetoric. The chthonian is his epic theme.Baudelaire grants mother nature neither Rousseau’s benevolence nor Sade’svitality. Poe’s Coleridgean nature is hostile but still sublime, a vast swirlingseascape. But Baudelaire is a city poet for whom there are no more adventures.He adopts Cleopatra’s Late Romantic fatigue. Baudelaire makes ennui hip, anavant-garde pose. Ennui certifies the sophisticate’s excess of experience: onehas seen and done everything. Unlike Poe, Baudelaire invents no secondary malepersonae for himself. His subject is the self as artificial enclave, like thecitadel of Poe’s Masque of the Red Death, which nature secretly enters anddisorders. Baudelaire is the first poet of mental and physical disease.For Baudelaire, sex is limitation, not liberation. Desire, normally a spur tomasculine action, makes the male passive toward his mother-born body. He isbetrayed by the body, delivered into female hands through sexual weakness.Nature’s power is wielded by pitiless vampires, the most numerous personae ofBaudelaire’s poetry. As in Poe, woman is always superior. Poe likes to dream ofdomestic bliss with a mother-bride. But Baudelaire’s women are rigid anduncompanionable. In his one maternal scene, “The Giantess,” he lives with aprimeval titaness at “her terrible games.” He climbs her “enormous knees” and,“like a quiet hamlet,” sleeps “in the shadow of her breasts.” The female body iscurvy geography, as in the Venus of Willendorf. Sexual connection is patentlyout of the question, for the male is no bigger than a trained flea. The playful,sunny tone, uncharacteristic for Baudelaire’s erotica, is possible because thescene is archaic rather than modern—like Salisbury Plain, which promptedWordsworth to make a similar sexual exception for his prehistoric warrior.Baudelaire’s women are intimidating. The “impure woman” is a “blind and deafmachine, fertile in cruelties,” “drinker of the blood of the world.” Beauty is“a sphinx” against whose stone breast every man bruises himself; she has a“heart of snow” and never weeps or laughs. She is a “monster enormous,frightful.” The sphinx Jeanne Duval, Baudelaire’s obsession, is like “the bleaksand and blue sky of deserts, insensible to human suffering.” She is nothing but“gold, steel, light and diamonds.” With “the cold majesty of the sterile woman,”she shines “like a useless star.” Duval has a “beautiful body polished likecopper.” She is a glistening serpent with eyes like “two cold jewels in whichgold mingles with iron.” She is a “beast implacable and cruel”; her cold catgaze “cuts and splits like a dart.” She is an “inhuman Amazon,” a “great angelof the bronze brow,” a “charming poniard” leaping from its sheath. MarieDaubrun, another of the poet’s favorites, is a ship with jutting prow. Herbreasts are shields “armed with rose points.” Her muscular arms, like those ofinfant Hercules, are “the solid rivals of glossy boa constrictors,” made tosqueeze her lover and imprint him on her heart.20 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note20a]The apocalyptic whore of “The Metamorphoses of the Vampire” brazenly boasts, “Ireplace, for him who sees me nude and without veils, the moon, the sun, the skyand the stars!” Sucking the marrow from her victim’s bones, she turns into a bagof pus and a rattling skeleton screeching in his bed. The vampire isever-changing mother nature, whose embrace is rape and ecstasy, death and decay.Baudelaire’s daemonic females renounce Rousseau’s tenderness. They have a Sadeansterility, divorcing the chthonian from fecundity. They are inorganic monolithsof steel and stone, their only living associations feline or reptilian. Theirmineral hardness comes from their barren habitat, an urban wasteland of “metal,marble, and water” petrifying the flesh (“Parisian Dream”). Like Blake’s Harlot,they are city-goddesses of polluted terrain. Gautier says of Baudelaire’s mythicwomen, “To none can a name be given. They are types rather than persons.”21[ch25_notes.html#ch16note21a] Impersonality always masculinizes a woman.Baudelaire’s female personae are hermaphroditic because of their blankindifference to the human. Sterility and emotional torpidity in a heavy-breastedwoman constitute my category of androgyne as virago. Baudelaire’s viragosresemble Michelangelo’s in the Mannerist Medici Chapel, a parallel the poetnotes (“The Ideal”). Baudelaire is uninterested in boy-girls or transvestites.His androgynes must be voluptuously female in body contour. In women he seeksonly hierarchic assertion. They have no other use for him, since they arestripped of their sexual and procreative functions.What of the male who inhabits this woman-ravaged universe? We meet him in “AVoyage to Cythera,” for me one of the poems of the century. A ship is in fullsail. The poet’s heart flies joyfully round the rigging like a bird in thecloudless sky. Suddenly a black stony island appears—Cythera, once-happybirthplace of Venus. On a three-branched gallows hangs the poet’s image, acorpse ravaged by birds, who peck out the eyes and eat the genitals. A prowlingpack of wolves wait for the leavings. Cythera is the world of sexual experience,into which the poet presses toward a horrifying revelation. Structurally, thepoem echoes Poe’s Masque of the Red Death, with its climactic phantom in abloody burial shroud. Baudelaire represents Decadent closure in entirelyperceptual terms. The poem opens in space and fresh, free motion, then shutsdown to a solitary image, the poet’s double, upon whom the eye obsessivelyfixes. Nature dwindles to the contracted self.“A Voyage to Cythera” moves from innocence to experience and from High to LateRomanticism. Its first illusion is about nature, which seems benign. The poet,misled by Rousseau, thinks of green myrtle and blooming flowers. But nature’sreality is Sadean, red in tooth and claw. Odysseus, tied to the mast, sees pilesof moldering skeletons littering the island of the Sirens. Baudelaire’s lustfulpriestess, wandering a temple grove, belongs to the pagan era, which integratedsex with religion. Christianity, on the other hand, afflicts humanity withchronic guilt. The gallows is the crucifix, desolating the sexual world. It isalso the tree of nature, a black cypress against the sky. Man is crucified uponhis own body. Nature is a Decadent tree loaded with rotten fruit, a “ripe”corpse bursting its skin and dribbling foul matter.Baudelaire’s double is an androgyne, the male heroine, a Romantic martyr. Thepassive male is attacked by drill-beaked birds, lacerating sexual desires.Venus’ doves turn Harpy. The victim is castrated and his body reshaped inparodic femaleness: his eyes are holes, and his belly spills out its bowels.Like Poe’s Morella, he gives birth to a lesser version of himself at the momentof death. The rotten sausage of his hanging intestines mocks his vanishedgenitals. Vital organs are ransacked because the human body is a house dividedagainst itself, undone by physical needs. Nature coerces man into sexualactivity, then punishes him with syphilis, venereal because the gift of Venus.“To make a voyage to Cythera” was French slang for sexual intercourse.22[ch25_notes.html#ch16note22a] Baudelaire, inspired by Nerval, may besardonically revising Wattéau’s exuberant painting, Embarkation for Cythera(1717). He says in another poem, “I am the wound and the knife!” He issimultaneously female masochist and male sadist, in agonizing psychic coitus, aDecadent self-abuse. In “A Voyage to Cythera,” the overexpanded High Romanticself is firmly dealt with by a public ritual of Late Romantic enslavement.The passivity of all humanity toward rapacious nature is brilliantly dramatizedin “A Carcass.” Strolling one summer morning, the poet and his beloved stumbleon an animal carcass: “Legs in the air, like a lewd woman, / Burning and oozingpoisons,” it opens its putrid belly to the sky. “The sun was shining on thatrottenness, / In order to cook it to a turn, / And to render a hundredfold togreat Nature / All that she had joined together.” The carcass “bloomed like aflower,” its perfume an overpowering stench. Flies buzz, and maggots rise andfall like a sparkling wave. The carcass gives out “a strange music,” like waterand wind or grain in the winnower’s basket. Its form is dreamily wavering anddissolving. A hungry female dog skulks, furious at the interruption. The poettenderly informs his beloved, “You will be like that filth, that horribleinfection, star of my eyes!” When she mildews among the bones, vermin like his“decomposed loves” will devour her with kisses. Decadent romance, sweet andsour.“A Voyage to Cythera” is a portrait of the artist as ritual victim where thepoet confronts his physically degenerated double, as Dorian Gray is to do withhis corroded portrait. In “A Carcass,” Baudelaire forces his beloved to confronther own double, a putrefying animal carcass, which omnipotent nature exploits tofeed her microbes, parasites, and beasts. The poem is a kind of déjeuner surl’herbe: nature is dining at home! The animal’s gender and identity and even itsintegrity as an object are receding. It is being reduced to primary materials,much as Sade’s victims are rent and abraded into subhuman particles. The teemingmaggots are a prophetic vision of inanimate nature-process or matter inmolecular wave-motion. Baudelaire’s “strange music” is also heard in Melville’sMoby-Dick, where a tropical grove hums like the loom of vegetable nature.Nature’s dichotomy of sunniness and cannibalism is mirrored in the poem’spolished classic form and gross content, beauty and repulsiveness joined.Baudelaire ironically brings love poetry’s exalted endearments to bear uponnature’s brute physicality, to which they are hopelessly unsuited. “A Carcass”is in the carpe diem tradition: Renaissance poems also dwell on the future deathand decay of a too-virginal beloved. But note Baudelaire’s Late Romanticinnovation: he no longer uses mortality as an argument to extort sexual favors,for the Decadence always swerves from sexual experience. Intercourse is far fromhis thoughts. In fact, if there is any eroticism in the poem—and heostentatiously introduces it by comparing the carcass to a spread-eagledwhore—it arises from his imagining the female body undergoing future Decadentdisintegration. In Decadent beauty, I said, part triumphs over whole. In “ACarcass,” embryogeny is reversed. Death, forcing the beloved to imitate theanimal’s deconstruction, will make her surrender gender, identity, andcoherence. It is this primitive spectacle of degeneration that arouses thepoet—an a priori necrophilia. The proud beloved will be raped by dominatrixmother nature, the jealous fanged bitch waiting in the shadows.So woman in Baudelaire is unsexed by being a vampire, a corpse, or, as we shallnow see, a lesbian. The first title of Flowers of Evil, advertised by thepublisher in 1846, was The Lesbians. Martin Turnell says, “Baudelaire’s interestin Lesbianism is something of a mystery and no one has yet accountedsatisfactorily for the prominence given to it in his poetry.”23[ch25_notes.html#ch16note23a] Proust, according to Gide, thought the themeproved Baudelaire’s homosexuality.24 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note24a] I doubt this,for Baudelaire rarely savors male beauty. The solution to the mystery is myprinciple of sexual metathesis, an artistic sex-change.Most lavish of the lesbian poems is “Damned Women: Delphine and Hippolyte.” In adim curtained chamber, young Hippolyte lies weeping on perfumed cushions.Delphine, like a tigress, gloats at her feet. Their first sex together has justoccurred. Women’s kisses, says Delphine, are light and delicate, while men areheavy-hooved oxen, making ruts in women’s bodies with their wagons or“lacerating plowshares.” Yokels and lummoxes! Hippolyte appreciates Delphine’serotic tutelage (like Sade’s Eugénie with Madame de Saint-Ange) but feelsanxious and dyspeptic, as if she has eaten too rich a night meal. Black phantomsrush at her, leading her along roads closed by “a bloody horizon.” Have theysinned? “But I feel my mouth move toward you,” the magnetism of Romanticcompulsion. Shaking her mane of hair, Delphine goes into a snit and curses thestupid “useless dreamer” who first mixed morality with love. Hippolyte, drained,longs for annihilation in Delphine’s bosom. The poet’s doleful voice suddenlyintervenes: “Descend, descend, lamentable victims, descend the road of eternalhell!” The lesbians will burn forever in their insatiable passion. They willwander the desert as scorched exiles of cities of the plain, fleeing theinfinity in their souls.Baudelaire owes this long, impressive poem to Balzac. Delphine and Hippolyte arethe Marquise de San-Real and Paquita Valdes, and we are in the boudoir of TheGirl with the Golden Eyes. The psychodrama is identical: a fiery sexualaggressor imprisons a fragile innocent in an opulent, claustrophobic retreat.Balzac never nears the moment of lesbian union, which only appears once removedin De Marsay’s transvestite rendezvous. In “Delphine and Hippolyte,” however, weourselves are so close to the characters post coitum that our invisible presenceinflames the already oppressive atmosphere. The palpable voyeurism of poet andreader comes from Gautier’s Mademoiselle de Maupin. Hippolyte’s “bloodyhorizon,” opening her sexually but sealing up earthly space, is from Gautier’s ANight with Cleopatra. Baudelaire recasts the sexual realm in entirely femaleterms. Woman is self-entombed in a perverse cell of sexual solipsism. Delphinerepeats Maupin’s aesthetic judgments: women are erotically refined, while menare clumsy brutes.Lesbianism is a breach in procreative nature, which Baudelaire is always eagerto insult. The lesbian is therefore another sterile woman, like his metalliccity-vampires. Baudelaire thinks homosexuality, as an unnatural practice, cannever be fully satisfied. It is a noble pursuit of “the impossible” thatattracts Gautier. In a shorter poem also called “Damned Women,” Baudelaire hailslesbians, of “unquenched thirsts,” as “Virgins, demons, monsters, martyrs, /Great spirits contemptuous of reality, / Seekers of the infinite.” Lesbians aregreat because they defy society, religion, and nature. Baudelaire’s celebrationof lesbianism must not be mistaken for sexual libertarianism. He would notpicket for gay rights. Walter Benjamin remarks, “To him, social ostracism wasinseparable from the heroic nature of this passion.”25[ch25_notes.html#ch16note25a] Hence the huge metaphysical background of theclimax of “Delphine and Hippolyte.” The poem cinematically opens the boudoir’slanguid, upholstered intimacy into a vast wasteland, the moral geography oflesbianism. Like Dante, Baudelaire sees the damned buffeted by winds and flamesof desire.In this poem a sex act is destiny, just as it is fraternal identity in The Girlwith the Golden Eyes. Baudelaire’s two women have Greek names and may even becitizens of Lesbos, but the poem’s world-view is Christian. Hippolyte isovercome by guilt, and Delphine denounces Jesus (the “useless dreamer”) forworsening the “insoluble problem” of sex. Christianity may be the antagonist,but it is also Christianity that gives lesbianism its moral or rather immoralstature. Baudelaire says, “The supreme voluptuous delight of love lies in thecertainty of doing evil.” Like Sade, he needs the fixities of organized religionto give his outrages an ethical significance and therefore erotic charge. Heconstantly seeks, as Colin Wilson notes, the gratuitous violation of taboo.26[ch25_notes.html#ch16note26a] The original shock of “Delphine and Hippolyte” islargely lost to our more tolerant time. Today, nothing sexual can appear quiteso evil. unless amplified by violence. Sexuality, by winning the war withreligion, has been diminished in scale.“Delphine and Hippolyte” is highly unusual for Baudelaire in having an entirelyfeminine woman, victim of lesbian seduction. Who is Hippolyte? I say she isBaudelaire himself, who has, by the same daring warp of imaginative gender wesaw in Coleridge’s Christabel, identified himself with the passive partner of alesbian couple. Baudelaire, as always, is hierarchically subordinate to hisferocious vampire. I found images elsewhere in Coleridge confirming hisprojection into his heroine’s trauma. There is a parallel between “Delphine andHippolyte” and “A Voyage to Cythera.” Hippolyte, like the poet’s hanged double,is attacked by swooping black creatures, phantoms in one poem and crows in theother. Baudelaire gives Jeanne Duval, “bizarre deity,” the name of a notoriousRoman lesbian: “I am not able, libertine Megaera, to break your courage and keepyou at bay, to become Proserpine in the hell of your bed!” (“Sed non satiata”).Baudelaire regrets he cannot do in real life what he elegantly achieves in“Delphine and Hippolyte”: to turn himself into a woman to seize the attention ofa lesbian dominatrix. If he is the maiden Persephone, Duval is the raptor Pluto,god of the underworld, here a whore’s rank crowded bed. In the shorter “DamnedWomen,” the obsessed lesbians are the poet’s “poor sisters.” Elsewhere he callsthe “hypocrite reader” his “double” and “brother.” So Baudelaire’s lesbiansisters are also his doubles. The title The Lesbians was self-characterizing.Orpheus’ head, torn off by Maenads, floated to Lesbos from Thrace: Orphic,woman-persecuted Baudelaire is a lesbian both as poet and sexual persona. Thepremiere lesbian poet was an androgyne: Baudelaire, echoing Horace, calls her“the male Sappho, the lover and the poet” (“Lesbos”). She is male not onlybecause she desires women like a man but because she is “le poëte.”Baudelaire’s lesbian poems are complex psychic mechanisms. First, the lesbianaggressor usurps the male privilege of defloration. Second, the poet’s genderchange intensifies the erotic passivity of his usual subjection to women. Third,women sexually occupied with each other automatically suspend masculineobligation. Man enjoys sexual amnesty from humiliating fears of impotence.Fourth, a lesbian’s erotic life is a locked room which man cannot penetrate.Thus lesbianism preserves the mystery of the Great Mother for a poet who findsnature’s processes otiose. By becoming a lesbian, the poet wins momentary rightof entry into a sexual heart of darkness. Fifth, lesbian self-sterilizationthwarts the relentless fertility of nature, for Baudelaire just a mass of“sanctified vegetables” that cannot move him.27 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note27a]Hence the increasing frequency of lesbianism, which the poet eagerly records,signals nature’s degeneration or apocalyptic decadence.The sex poems of Flowers of Evil caused a scandal, and the book’s proofs wereseized. Baudelaire and his publisher were tried and fined. Six poems, declaredan “offense against morality and decency,” were condemned and censored, anofficial ban not revoked until 1949. These included “Delphine and Hippolyte,”“Lesbos,” and “The Metamorphoses of the Vampire.” “Delphine and Hippolyte” haddiverse progeny during the next decade. Courbet’s The Sleepers (1866) is surelyindebted to Baudelaire and Balzac. Two women, blonde and brunette, lie nude andsensuously intertwined, broken pearls and hair comb cast about the mussed bed aserotic evidence of haste and tumult. The background is a heavy drape of darkblue velvet, ominous cloud of a Baudelairean night sky. Two poeticredramatizations of “Delphine and Hippolyte”: Swinburne’s Anactoria in Poems andBallads (1866) and Verlaine’s The Girlfriends: Scenes of Sapphic Love (1867).The self-projections of both these poets were demonstrably masochistic. Proust’stheory that Baudelaire’s lesbian themes prove homosexuality would better fit theopenly homosexual Verlaine. Proust, like everyone else, overlooks lesbianism’ssymbolic meaning in nineteenth-century nature-theory. He has in fact transferredto Baudelaire his own homosexual use of sexual metathesis in Remembrance ofThings Past: the secret transformation of bewitching Alfred Agostinelli into thelesbian Albertine is a virtuoso act of Late Romantic imagination. Albertine, amysterious prisoner of love descending from the girl with the golden eyes, didnot slip into her new gender without arousing the skepticism of knowledgeableParisians.28 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note28a]Baudelaire’s prose contains a theory of the ideal male persona. The Painter ofModern Life (1863) makes the dandy the epitome of personal style. Baudelaire ispartly drawing on Barbey d’Aurevilly’s essay on dandyism (1845), which descendsfrom Castiglione. Baudelaire calls dandyism a Romantic “cult of the self”arising from “the burning need” to create “a personal originality.” HighRomantic politics were populist and democratic, but Late Romantic ones arereactionary. Dandyism is “a new kind of aristocracy,” a “haughty and exclusive”sect resisting “the rising tide of democracy, which invades and levelseverything.”29 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note29a] Late Romanticism is arrogantlyelitist, a point that must be remembered for Oscar Wilde, whose political viewshave been sentimentalized by modern admirers. Baudelaire loathes the new massculture, which he identifies with mediocrity. He equally rejects reformers anddo-gooders. Gautier says, “Baudelaire abhorred philanthropists, progressists,utilitarians, humanitarians, utopists.”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note30a] In otherwords, Baudelaire condemned Rousseauism in all its forms. Today, Rousseauism hasso triumphed that the arts and the avant-garde are synonymous with liberalism,an error reinforced by literature teachers, with their humanist bias. I followthe Decadents in trying to drive Rousseauist benevolence out of discourse on artand nature. The Decadents satirized the liberal faith in progress with sizzlingprophecies of catastrophe and cultural collapse.Baudelaire’s dandy is an Apollonian androgyne, drawing a sharp line betweenhimself and reality. The dandy, with “aristocratic superiority of mind,” aimsfor “distinction above all things.” Distinction is aboveness and apartness. Thedandy’s vocation is elegance, incarnating the Platonic “idea of beauty” in hisown person. He is an artificial personality. The self, sculpted by imperiousApollonian contour, has become an object or objet d’art. In Late Romanticism,the expansive High Romantic self, ecstatically open to nature like Shelley withthe West Wind, undergoes hieratic sequestration. Baudelaire was the first artistto live as an aesthete, putting into practice what Poe only imagined. Sartresays Baudelaire turned the English dandy’s virile athleticism into “femininecoquettishness.”31 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note31a] But Barbey already callsdandies “the Androgynes of History,” belonging to “an indecisive intellectualsex,” combining grace with power.32 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note32a] There wasnothing athletic in the languid Baudelaire, who had, says Gautier, a neck of“feminine elegance and whiteness.”33 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note33a] Gautier callshim a cat, that favorite animal of aesthetes and Decadents. The cat too is adandy, cold, elegant, and narcissistic, importing hierarchic Egyptian style intomodern life.In Greek and Renaissance art, the Apollonian androgyne represented social orderand public values. But Baudelaire’s Apollonian dandy represents art divorcedfrom society. No laws are recognized except aesthetic ones. Late Romanticpersonality is debilitated by its own absolutism. After Baudelaire’s generationcomes a sexual persona I call the depraved Decadent aesthete, like the courthermaphrodite repellent for its narrow egotism. Baudelaire’s languor, thefatigue of one cut off from nature, remains with the aesthete to the fin desiècle. We see it in Wilde’s Lord Henry Wotton, with his opium-taintedcigarettes. But Wotton, robustly English, is immune to the occupational diseaseof the depraved aesthete, a neurasthenic sickliness covered by ghastlycosmetics. Examples are Huysmans’ Des Esseintes, Mann’s Aschenbach, and Proust’sCharlus. In real life there were the Satanist Aleister Crowley and Count Robertde Montesquiou, model for Des Esseintes and Charlus. In our century, aninternational class of aging male homosexual conforms to this type, with epicenemanners and aesthetic pretensions. The voice is waspish, the figure thin andfluttery; the pallid, puffy face seems boneless, like that of Miss Havisham,Dickens’ rouged crone. Homosexual fashion has passed the type by in America, buthe still flourishes in Latin countries. The dilettante aesthete is a decayedApollonian androgyne.Another chapter of The Painter of Modern Life considers the female persona, forwhom Baudelaire espouses extremism in cosmetics. In an inimitably Frenchlocution, he scornfully dismisses the idea that rouge should be used sparinglyto enhance nature: “Who would dare to assign to art the sterile function ofimitating Nature?” Rousseau and Wordsworth shrink into their foxhole. Cosmeticsare pure artifice, meant to hide nature’s insulting blemishes and to create “anabstract unity in the color and texture of the skin.” The face is a mask, acanvas on which to paint. Cosmetics must seem unnatural, theatrical. Woman is“an idol,” obliged to appear “magical and supernatural.” All fashion is “asublime deformation of nature.”34 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note34a] Actress StéphaneAudran in Les Biches is for me the most stunning exemplar of Baudelaireancosmetics. As usual, Baudelaire makes woman into an objet de culte with a hard,metallic surface. To emphasize woman’s surface is to deny her internal space,her murky womb-world. The heavily rouged woman—in the nineteenth century a whore(Gone with the Wind’s hot-pink Belle Watling)—is another symbol of Baudelaireansterility.Elsewhere Baudelaire says: “Woman is the opposite of the dandy. Therefore shemust inspire horror…. Woman is natural, that is to say abominable.”35[ch25_notes.html#ch16note35a] Why horror?—an oddly intense word in the contextof the dandy. The answer is that the mineral flesh of Baudelaire’s vampiresrestricts and confines nature’s chthonian liquidity. Woman is the dandy’sopposite because she lacks spiritual contour and inhabits the procreative realmof fluids where objects dissolve. All art, as a cult of the autonomous object,is a flight from liquidity. The Decadent swerve from sexual experience isidentical with the Decadent creation of a world of glittering art objects. Bothare responses to the horror of the female liquid realm. The Baudelairean womanis mentally and physically impenetrable. The hideous bag of pus of“Metamorphoses of the Vampire” hardens to stone, into which the poet cannot besucked. Baudelaire’s pagan poems seal up female internality, the maw ofrapacious nature.Joris-Karl Huysmans’ novel A Rebours (1884) expands the Decadent innovations ofBalzac, Gautier, Poe, and Baudelaire. The title means “against nature” or“against the grain.” Des Esseintes, the epicene hero, is product of anincest-degenerated aristocratic line, like Poe’s Usher. Romantic solipsismcontracts to its ultimate Decadent closure. Renouncing social relationships, DesEsseintes withdraws into the self-embowered world of his ornate mansion.Surrounded by curios and art works, he is like a Pharaoh entombed with hispossessions. He is both priest and idol of his own cult. But his dream ofperfect freedom is defeated by humiliating dependency on others—servants,doctors, dentists, horticulturists. A Rebours contains its own ironicself-deflation. Like Madame Bovary, it shows reality comically frustrating thelofty ideals of an author-identified protagonist. Des Esseintes wants lifeentirely artistic and artificial. But nature takes her revenge, tormenting himwith toothache, nauseating him with his rare perfumes, disordering hisdelicacy-sated stomach. Unable to eat, Des Esseintes is fed by enema, “theultimate deviation from the norm” which he relishes as “a happy affront againstnature”: “What a slap in the face for old Mother Nature!”36[ch25_notes.html#ch16note36a] The novel ends with the ailing aesthete forced toreturn to society and nature. So the Decadent enterprise fails.A Rebours is a novel without a plot, consistent with the Romantic withdrawalfrom action. It is spiritual autobiography, recording a journey not throughspace but through modes of perception and experience. The chapters, containingfew events, are meditations on things: books, flowers, antiques. Persons arealso things. Des Esseintes performs a botched Sadean experiment on a boy bytrying to turn him into a criminal. Des Esseintes has the Decadent sexualrecessiveness. He trifles, with poor results, with two masculine women he hopeswill give him a new sensation. Miss Urania, an American acrobat with boy’s hairand “arms of iron,” is really an automaton, slow and witless. When heroscillating gender turns feminine, Des Esseintes drops her like a hot potato.Reality always falls short of imagination. Miss Urania is all muscle and nomystique. She exasperatingly refuses to take charge. Without Baudelairean sexualsubordination, Des Esseintes is impotent (apparently like Huysmans himself). Butpotency belongs to the realm of vulgar acts. Decadent eroticism is perceptual orcerebral.Unlike Poe, Baudelaire, and Swinburne, Huysmans has no anima or projected femalespirit. Even Roderick Usher is immured with a sister. Des Esseintes’ lavishmansion may be Huysmans’ attempt to construct a male house, a mental spaceexcluding the female. But the repressed always returns with redoubled force. Theaesthete’s buried affect toward women produces the horrors of Chapter Eight, aspectacular flight of imagination. Over ten astonishing pages, woman appears instages of increasing sexual clarity. It is Huysmans’ metamorphoses of thevampire. The process begins as another exercise in Decadent connoisseurship. DesEsseintes has been a collector of artificial flowers that look real, nature ofcourse being inadequate: “Nature, he used to say, has had her day; she hasfinally and utterly exhausted the patience of sensitive observers by therevolting uniformity of her landscapes and skyscapes.” But Chapter Eightadvances past this Baudelairean position into new Decadent terrain: “Tired ofartificial flowers aping real ones, he wanted some natural flowers that wouldlook like fakes.”37 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note37a] He will force nature intoart’s frame.Des Esseintes inspects cartloads of hothouse specimens, lurid flowers of evil.There are Caladiums with “swollen, hairy stems” and “huge heart-shaped leaves.”Aurora Borealis with “leaves the colour of raw meat.” Echinopsis with “ghastlypink blossoms” like “the stumps of amputated limbs.” Nidularium, with“sword-shaped petals” and “gaping flesh-wounds.” Cypripedium like a diseased,bent-back “human tongue” in a medical text. Some flowers seem “ravaged bysyphilis or leprosy,” others “blistered by burns” or “pitted with ulcers.” Tomake these “monstrosities,” nature borrows tints of rotting flesh and the“hideous splendours” of gangrene. Muses Des Esseintes, “It all comes down tosyphilis in the end.”38 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note38a]Huysmans’ fantastic catalog is a meditation on Romantic nature. It is ananti-Rousseauist polemic, where not society but nature is shown as deeplycorrupt. Organic life is in advanced disease, clotted with mutilations insultingbeauty and form. We seem to be in a brand-new genre, science fiction,transporting us to a Venusian jungle of half-animal plant creatures. This isHuysmans’ voyage to Cythera, Venus’ isle. Baudelaire’s syphilitic hanged man isinfected by Huysmans’ noxious blooms, the ulcerated genitals of mother nature.Syphilis, which Des Esseintes sees devastating every generation “since thebeginning of the world,” is like Poe’s red death invading the prince’s castleand annihilating humanity. The flowers are a Trojan Horse bringing deadlyfreight into Des Esseintes’ walled city: the daemonic female of chthoniannature.Adam in the primeval garden falls asleep for the birth of woman. Exhausted, DesEsseintes dreams a series of weird female androgynes, first a tall, thin womanin Prussian soldier’s boots, then a haggard “sexless creature” on horseback, hergreen skin studded with pustules. He recognizes her as “the Pox,” a femaleversion of Poe’s ghoulish masquer. The dream shifts to “a hideous minerallandscape,” surely Baudelaire’s rocky Cythera. Here Des Esseintes has one of themost horrifying archetypal experiences in literature. Something stirs on theground, “an ashen-faced woman, naked but for a pair of green silk stockings.”Nepenthes pitchers hang from her ears; “tints of boiled veal” show in herflaring nostrils. As she calls to him, her eyes glow, her lips redden, and hernipples shine like “two red peppers.” He recoils in horror from her spottedskin.But the woman’s eyes fascinated him, and he went slowly towards her, trying todig his heels into the ground to hold himself back, and falling overdeliberately, only to pick himself up again and go on. He was almost touchingher when black Amorphophalli sprang up on every side and stabbed at her belly,which was rising and falling like a sea. He thrust them aside and pushed themback, utterly nauseated by the sight of these hot, firm stems twisting andturning between his fingers.Her arms reach toward him. He panics as her eyes turn a terrible “clear, coldblue.” “He made a superhuman effort to free himself from her embrace, but withan irresistible movement she clutched him and held him, and pale with horror, hesaw the savage Nidularium blossoming between her uplifted thighs, with itsswordblades gaping open to expose the bloody depths.” Just before he touches theplant’s “hideous fleshwound,” he wakes up, choking with fear. “‘Thank God,’ hesobbed, ‘it was only a dream.’”39 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note39a]Thus Chapter Eight ends, with Des Esseintes having escaped, like Poe’s hero inthe maelstrom, from a forcible return to female origins, sucked into the womb ofthe rapacious all-mother. The woman in green stockings is a syphilitic whore,like Blake’s Harlot. Her earrings of carnivorous plants symbolize her commandover nature. The boiled veal of her nostrils is the fetid grossness of biology,to which the female always resummons the male. Her nipples are red peppersbecause they scald the lips of every infant and perforate the chest of everyman. Her eyes fascinate because she is the vampire hypnotizing by eye-contact.Des Esseintes is magnetically drawn to her even in his terror because she exertsearth’s malign gravitation, which we saw at work in Michelangelo.Amorphophallus is, incredibly, a real flowering plant of great height; the namemeans “shapeless” or “misshapen penises.” The black fronds springing up andstabbing at the woman’s belly are her self-generated male organs, by which shepleasures and fecundates herself. Her belly “rising and falling like a sea”contracts in orgasm and labor: she is Baudelaire’s parkside carcass billowingwith maggots. The swordblades ringing her vulval “bloody depths” reproducemythology’s vagina dentata. Female genitals perceived as a wound are acommonplace of psychoanalytic literature. That they can be a diseased flower weknow from Blake’s “Sick Rose.” Tennessee Williams told Elizabeth Ashley aboutbeing taken to a brothel for his “initiation into manhood.” A prostitute forcedhim to look between her legs: “‘All I could see was somethin’ that looked like adyin’ orchid. Consequently I have never been comfortable either with orchids orwomen.’”40 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note40a] In A Rebours, female genitalia areflower and wound, because this is the place where man is born and from which hemust tear himself away. Des Esseintes builds a palace of art against nature, butin his dreams nature comes to reclaim and devour him.Huysmans’ poisonous genital flowers are botanic androgynes, like Lewis Carroll’sshrewish rose and tiger-lily. “Androgynous” is actually a scientific term forplants with staminate and pistillate flowers in one cluster. The femalevegetation of A Rebours relates to some amazingly misogynous remarks Huysmansmade about Degas’ paintings of bathing women. He speaks of “the humid horror ofa body which no washing can purify.”41 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note41a] Humidhorror: here is that inescapable connection I find between female physiology andthe chthonian liquid realm. Certain male celibates or homosexuals express theirphobic attitude toward the female body in a nervous fastidiousness, a compulsivecleanliness manifested in small well-scrubbed hands, punctilious dress, andaridity of manner and speech. In the old days, such men were the petty tyrantsof musty midlevel civic, bank, and library bureaucracies. The female, with herdark, dank inwardness, is visually unintelligible. Medusa’s pubic head is theplant world of writhing stems and vines; she is artistic disorder, the breakdownof form. Liquidity plus vegetative overgrowth equals the chthonian swamp offemale nature. The male homosexual, the most active dissenter from femaledominance, rebels against the marshy organicism of the female pudendum and thecushy softness of the female body, which he perceives as irresolution ofsilhouette. This is one reason why, in America, so many gay men are reed-thin,while so many gay women are fat. When women stop trying to please the harsh maleeye, the female body just drifts right back to oceanic nature. In A Rebours,written by an idealizing celibate, the connoisseur Des Esseintes creates aritual cult of sharply defined objets d’art, because Decadent aestheticism isthe most comprehensive system of aversion to female nature devised by westernculture.Tennessee Williams’ memory of his traumatic initiation confirms my chthonianreading of Suddenly Last Summer. The play originally appeared with another inGarden District (1958), a New Orleans place name that Williams makes a metaphorof rapacious nature. The brilliant movie of Suddenly Last Summer (1960),directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz with a screenplay by Gore Vidal, was a criticaldisaster. It shows mother nature as a Sadean and Darwinian vortex where the weakare devoured by the strong. In an incantatory scene of expressionistic horror,straining at the emotional limits of film, Katharine Hepburn as Violet Venablenarrates the annual assault of birds of the Encantadas on newborn turtles asthey race for the sea.Suddenly Last Summer is A Rebours turned inside out. Instead of a chthoniancubicle (Huysmans’ horticultural Chapter Eight) inside an aesthetic domain,there is an aesthetic cubicle inside a chthonian domain. Williams’ aestheticcubicle is a votive shrine preserved by a despotic mater dolorosa in honor ofher son/lover, the homosexual aesthete Sebastian Venable, who produced oneperfect poem per year, in a fancy private edition worthy of Des Esseintes.Wealthy mother and son were “a famous couple,” touring fashionable Europe. Inthe inseparable Violet and Sebastian, Williams sexually updates Shakespeare’shermaphrodite twins, Viola and Sebastian. Modernization here, as in Picasso,means a return to primitive archetype. Violet and Sebastian are the Great Motherand her ritually slain son. He is killed by a pack of predatory beggar boys, whohack and eat his flesh in ritual sparagmos. She cultivates insectivorous plantsin a steaming “jungle-garden,” which the play describes with language straightfrom A Rebours.42 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note42a] The sinister garden is cinema’smost potent evocation of the primeval swamp-world, rivalled only by the dinosaursaga of Disney’s Fantasia. Mankiewicz’ film is sophisticated and learned:hanging in the son’s chamber is a Renaissance painting of St. Sebastian, thebleeding beautiful boy. Sebastian Venable belongs to the tradition of homoeroticmartyr, to which Oscar Wilde contributed by taking the name Sebastian Melmothafter his release from prison.Des Esseintes’ aesthetic ambition is to discriminate, to use Pater’s word, everything and every experience. This scholarly process secures the identity ofobjects against nature. Ironically, in A Rebours discrimination collapses backinto nondifferentiation. All the aesthete’s exotic fragrances begin to smelldisgustingly alike. Language alone retains its Decadent separateness. Gautiersays imperial late Latin was “an ingenious, complex, learned style,” whichBaudelaire drew upon for inspiration, since “the fourteen hundred words inRacine’s vocabulary” are inadequate for complex modern ideas.43[ch25_notes.html#ch16note43a] Hugo’s Hernani, whose defense Gautier led, defiedthe Racinian canon with its eccentric locutions in the Shakespearean manner. ARebours culminates this movement to broaden the rationalist French language.Huysmans’ rich, bizarre vocabulary is both antiquarian and futurist. Symonssaid, “He could describe the inside of a cow hanging in a butcher’s shop asbeautifully as if it were a casket of jewels.”44 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note44a]The diversification of Huysmans’ language is a psychic and therefore sexualself-development. A Rebours has few characters, for words substitute forpersons. Des Esseintes admires imperial Latin because “it was rotten through andthrough and hung like a decaying carcass, losing its limbs, oozing pus, barelykeeping, in the general corruption of its body, a few sound parts.”45[ch25_notes.html#ch16note45a] Language becomes Baudelaire’s crucified corpse. Isaid the body in Spenser is a social integer. The paradigm in Baudelaire is thealienated body: each poem is a corrupted object, a mirror of the self.Baudelaire made lyric a reliquary of decay. In Huysmans, with his glut of rarewords, language generates dense new personae. A Rebours (originally calledAlone) is Romantically self-contained, its linguistic energy invested ininternal sexual differentiation. Its words are thronging multiples, spores ofcompetitive identity. The whole, subdividing into fractious parts, makes love toitself.Two minor writers of the late nineteenth century also depict sexual personae inDecadent enslavement and closure. In Venus in Furs (1870), Leopold vonSacher-Masoch, who gave his name to masochism, creates a theatrical world offemale dominance. Like Baudelaire and Swinburne, Masoch hails “the tyranny andcruelty that constitute woman’s essence and her beauty.” Severin, his hero,imposes a ritual role on Wanda, whom he drapes in furs and arms with a whip. Sheis a sexual totem, bristling with symbols. Severin says, “It is possible to lovereally only that which stands above us.”46 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note46a] Hereone clearly sees that masochism is not an illness but a hierarchical dream, aconceptual realignment of sexual orders. Eros parodies or recapitulates thesacred because, as I suggested, sexuality, even at its most perverse, isimplicitly religious. Sex is the ritual link between man and nature. Masoch’sobsession with furs is, in Freudian terms, a fetishistic longing for themother’s pubic hair. But Anthony Storr calls fetishism “a triumph of humanimagination”: the fetishist’s desire is moved “from a sensation to an idea.”47[ch25_notes.html#ch16note47a] I view Masoch’s furs as chthonian. Wanda caststhem around Severin like Aeschylus’ female net, the harness of Necessity, animage Masoch actually cites. The furs are “electric,” like Zeus’s thundercloudand Athena’s aegis. Wanda is “the cruel northern Venus in Furs,” half chthonian,half Apollonian, fusing emotional and cultural opposites. The novel’simaginative center is a series of stunning cinematic stills of Wanda inepiphany. She appears in glamourous hieratic attitudes blazing with light, anApollonian icon in a private cult. Narrative halts, as we contemplate theandrogyne in the Apollonian mode, a work of visual art temporarily dominatingits own text. Hierarchic assertions of tremendous force are needed to lock theaggressive western eye into perceptual submission.The Decadent is usually male, since decadence, literally a “falling off,”requires renunciation of a cultural burden, abandonment of a public persona orduty. Rachilde, wife of Arthur Vallette, founder of Le Mercure de France,produced a huge volume of work in her long life, but her most notorious book wasMonsieur Vénus (1884), one of the oddest things ever written by a woman. GeorgeSand had been granted the honorific “man of letters,” which Rachilde took forher calling card. She was to be called Paris’ “androgyne of letters.” In Venusin Furs, sadism is induced from a normal woman by a masochistic male. InMonsieur Vénus, masochism is induced from a delicate male by a sadistic woman.The title alludes to both the soft youth, Jacques Silvert, and his lordlymaster-mistress, Raoule de Vénérande, a corrupted matronymic indicating herdescent from Venus in the century of syphilis. Like Maupin, Raoule is an Amazonand expert fencer. But her desires are more sensual and perverse. She discoversJacques, a maker of artificial flowers, exactly as Cousin Bette unearths thefeminine Polish sculptor. Raoule installs her acquisition in a luxuriousboudoir, a love prison modelled on The Girl with the Golden Eyes. Shesystematically eradicates Jacques’s residual maleness. Adonis becomes anodalisque, his gender dissolving in the boudoir’s shimmering liquid realm.Raoule indignantly denies she is lesbian. This vice, deliciously scandalousfifty years before, has already become banal, “the crime of boarding-schoolteachers and the fault of the prostitute.” Like Gautier’s D’Albert, Raoulecraves “the impossible”: she wants to be “in love like a man with a man.”48[ch25_notes.html#ch16note48a] The sole parallel I find is in an Olympia Presssex novel, where someone says of a butch lesbian, “She was so queer she hadfinally come around to men, as a faggot!”49 [ch25_notes.html#ch16note49a]Visiting Jacques, Raoule begins to wear male evening dress and refer to him as“she.” She forces “various degradations” on him: “They were more and more unitedin a common thought: the destruction of their sex.” The distance fromMademoiselle de Maupin is enormous. Maupin’s quest for a man’s freedom becomesRaoule’s campaign to reduce a male to servitude, like Hercules under Omphale.Raoule seeks something transcendental from sex experience, but her technique isDecadent enslavement. When Jacques begins to drift from control, she coollyarranges for his execution. Adonis, ritually slain, will be ritually mourned byhis patron goddess. Monsieur Venus ends in a shocking spectacle of Decadentclosure. In a secret chamber, Raoule builds a shrine to her dead lover. A waxand rubber effigy lies in state on the bed, a Venus seashell. Hair, lashes,teeth, and nails are all real, “torn from a corpse,” as endorsed by Poe. Insometimes male, sometimes female dress, Raoule kisses the statue’s mouth, whichmoves by “a hidden spring.” Decadent objectification, begun by the High Romanticturn toward art, reaches its final grotesque point. A person has literallybecome a thing. The beautiful boy as Adonis, who enters the novel hung withgarlands of satin roses, is turned into the androgyne as manufactured object, afrigid android. Raoule is like Balzac’s marquise, killing her lover in order tomemorialize her. But the marquise then leaves the boudoir behind. Raoule deVénérande, at the height of the Decadence, walls up her sanctuary even morewillfully. She remains alone, married to herself and a work of sexual sculpture.All other objects of the visible world, annihilated by their Decadent profusion,have sunk to nothingness."},{"pageContent":"17ROMANTIC SHADOWSEmily BrontëEnglish Romanticism in the nineteenth century had two choices: Wordsworth orColeridge? Their argument between benevolent and daemonic nature is continued byEmily Brontë in Wuthering Heights (1847). Romanticism’s amorality and paganpower are concentrated in its Byronic hero, Heathcliff, product of a stunningsex change. Heathcliff is Emily Brontë, a woman who pressed at the limits ofgender and, failing to find satisfaction in art, died. After epic, the socialnovel is the genre most hostile to the androgyne. But Wuthering Heights is not asocial novel, like those of Jane Austen and George Eliot. It is a Romanticprose-poem, belonging like Hawthorne’s eerie tales to the tradition of romance,which, as Northrop Frye says, “radiates a glow of subjective intensity.”1[ch25_notes.html#ch17note1a] The covert subjectivity of Wuthering Heightsproduces its sexual ambiguities. In the novel’s secret psychodrama,hermaphrodite Emily Brontë clashes with society, law, fate.Before arriving at Wuthering Heights, we must briefly consider the social novel.Nineteenth-century literature embraces ordinariness, the routine minutiae ofdaily life. The rise of the Romantic objet d’art is paralleled by the socialnovel’s documentation of objects, rare in eighteenth-century fiction. Balzacopens Père Goriot with a slow, photographic inspection of a squalid roominghouse. Character in the social novel, a child of Rousseau, is formed byenvironment. George Eliot says she seeks “as full a vision of the medium inwhich a character moves as of the character itself.” She records “the hamperingthreadlike pressure of small social conditions, and their frustratingcomplexity.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note2a] Context rivals character. TheEnglish, French, and Russian nineteenth-century novel contains a Shakespeareanprofusion of personalities, each with a private code of speech and gesture. Yetthere are few androgynes. Why?A good example is Eliot’s Middlemarch (1871–72), which traps its characters in aweb of interdependence. Chief victim is the intelligent, womanly heroine,Dorothea Brooke. Because it is concerned with wholes, the interaction of groupsand subgroups, the social novel subjects sexual personae to the discipline oflimitation. Middlemarch bridles its two nascent androgynes, Rosamond Lydgate andWill Ladislaw. Frivolous Rosamond, saboteur of her husband’s career, paralyzesby “torpedo contact.” F. R. Leavis sees in her narcissistic turn of the neck “asinister hint of the snake.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note3a] She is the archetypalfatal woman, but the social novel curbs and reduces her in scale. The fearfuland barbarous become the shallow and silly. Eliot gives the vampire’spsychopathic moral blankness clever new form: “In poor Rosamond’s mind there wasnot room enough for luxuries to look small in.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note4a]The vampire is half-modern, half-archaic, a bourgeoise and dinosaur with thebrain of a pea.Everyone agrees that Will Ladislaw, with whom Dorothea inexplicably falls inlove, is, as Arnold Kettle puts it, Eliot’s most glaring “artistic failure.”5[ch25_notes.html#ch17note5a] My explanation: the flitting Ladislaw suffers fromthe social novel’s antipathy to the androgyne. How has a Pole turned up in anEnglish country town anyway? I think he is Balzac’s effeminate Polish artist,the Chopin-inspired Wenceslas, whom potent Bette takes under her wing. Eliottries to make Ladislaw charismatic: “When he turned his head quickly his hairseemed to shake out light.” He has a “preternatural quickness and glibness” ofspeech, hardly the reliable style of “solid Englishmen.”6[ch25_notes.html#ch17note6a] Mercurial or puckish speed always diminishes themasculine. Ladislaw is a Shakespearean androgyne of verbal mobility, but thenineteenth century denies him his Renaissance authority. Ladislaw’s aura oflight winks feebly on and off because the social novel, in its devotion to thewhole, opposes the hieratically self-isolating charismatic personality. Note theway Tolstoy portrays Napoleon, one of the most charismatic men in history, as asmall man with small hands and a small smile. By its reality principle oflimitation, Middlemarch confines the androgynes Rosamond and Ladislaw to thediurnal and prosaic, truncating their affective power. Rosamond is a ninny andLadislaw a flaneur. Eliot says her heroine’s pulses of emotion “tremble off andare dispersed among hindrances.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note7a] Dispersion alsorules dominant personae like the androgyne: the social novel’s fictive energy,distributed throughout the minor characters and environment, is rarelyconcentrated in a node of high glamour.The frigidity of the Apollonian androgyne in a social novel is a social crime,for withholding of emotion frustrates community and compromise. Egoism is theandrogyne’s raison d’être. Self-complete beings need no one and nothing. JaneAusten’s Emma (1816) illustrates the social novel’s association of androgynywith selfish privatism. Edmund Wilson first pointed out the delicate touch ofsexual ambivalence in the beautiful and witty Emma Woodhouse: she is “relativelyindifferent to men” and “inclined to infatuations with women.” Marvin Mudricksays, “Emma prefers the company of women, more particularly of women whom shecan master and direct; … this preference is intrinsic to her whole dominatingand uncommitting personality.” Andrew H. Wright speaks of Emma’s “supremeself-confidence and serene delusion” and Douglas Bush of her “managerial vanityand arrogance.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note8a] Emma’s autocracy and lesbianflirtation are a single phenomenon, a hermaphroditic hierarchism which thesocial novel cannot tolerate. Stuart M. Tave brilliantly says of Emma, “Whatreally defeats her, it seems, is the ordered form and truth of the plot which,from start to finish, meets her at every turn as it maintains its beautiful andinevitable course.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note9a] In other words, the novelitself, in its formal essence, rises up to check the pretensions of thecharismatic personality, humanizing and normalizing it for marriage, foundationof the social order. There is a parallel with English Renaissance literature,where the Amazon sacrifices her androgyny for the public good.Emma, like Dorian Gray, enchants by a double-sexed charm, to which not allreaders are susceptible. But it is the mysterious iridescence of Emma’shalf-repellent character that has evoked from commentators on the novel a bodyof criticism unusual in its fineness. Emma is a reactionary work of Augustanassumptions, and its heroine presides from a tribunal of privilege. Emma’swell-bred aggression becomes crasser in Rebecca Sharp, the upwardly mobileadventuress of Thackeray’s Vanity Fair (1847–48). Becky has Emma’smanipulativeness and Cousin Bette’s cold male will. Her masculine force ofpersonality upstages the nominal heroine, placid, feminine Amelia Sedley.Nevertheless, Vanity Fair, as a social novel, maintains its opposition toglamour, which appears as an amoral hardness.Becky’s rare visits to her neglected son Rawdon are in the radiant style ofApollonian epiphany. She glitters with jewels and high fashion, superb,“unearthly,” unreachable. She bursts upon the eye like Spenser’s Belphoebe inthe forest—an episode based on another maternal epiphany, the appearance ofVergil’s armed Venus to Aeneas. But now the assumptions are different. Thackeraylaments: “Oh, thou poor lonely little benighted boy! Mother is the name for Godin the lips and hearts of little children; and here was one who was worshippinga stone!”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note10a] Stony Becky Sharp, self-sculpted bysharp Apollonian contour, descends on her son as a goddess, a meteoritePalladium. Becky’s moral fault is her evasion of ordinariness, of simple homelyemotion. The social novel differs from Renaissance and Romantic literature inits resistance to the mystically transcendent personality. Apollonian glamouralways occurs at the expense of the ethical. We see this in Balzac’s dandy DeMarsay snubbing Lucien at the Opéra or in Proust’s Duchesse de Guermantesturning her back on the dying Swann to hurry to her carriage on the way to adinner party, in that cruel and pivotal moment, modelled on a similar scene inBalzac, which is exactly midway through Remembrance of Things Past.The Apollonian hierarch is a narcissist, frozen in moral adolescence. HenceArtemis’ and Belphoebe’s boyish body type. Apollonian perfection and fixity areforeign to the social novel, which endorses a developmental model ofpersonality. Developmentalism comes from Rousseau, dramatized in hisautobiography. Personality in the social novel must be in evolutionary change,not the same thing as Dionysian metamorphosis. The high-energy Dionysianandrogyne alters spontaneously, for no climax of maturation. Personality changein the social novel may come through petty, grinding humiliations, unlike thesudden turns of Fortune’s wheel bringing down the hero of Renaissance drama.Renaissance personality is immanent. Similarly, Romantic personality is primaryand absolute, a flame of imagination lit by the gods. A Renaissance aristocrathas quality of blood, wondrously manifested in fine complexion, manner, andspeech, even in a kidnapped prince reared in a hovel. In the social novel, anaristocrat is simply a social type. His is a chance supremacy, evolutionary andnot innate. He is like a boulder left on a summit by a vanished glacier.The purer the social novel, the more negative it is to the androgyne. Thegreater the influx of Romantic consciousness, as in Virginia Woolf, the greaterthe frequency of hermaphroditic personae. Dickens, for example, disagrees withGeorge Eliot on several basic issues. His social structures are not educative,leading from self-involvement to community, but oppressive and labyrinthine,emotion-killing. His novels descend from Blake’s protest poems on exploitedchimney sweeps. The child is Dickens’ ideal type, uncorrupted, as in Rousseauand Wordsworth, by civilization. His virtuous characters retain the unitaryqualities of childhood: innocence, purity, simplicity. His veneration of thepresexual child makes him receptive to male androgynes of benevolenteccentricity, like quirky Mr. Micawber, holy lunatics of untainted mind.Dickens’ novels retain elements of the parable or morality play. Thus when heturns to allegory, the androgyne immediately appears, as in the three sexless orsexually dual apparitions of A Christmas Carol.Androgynes are more common in the French novel, where they enjoy thematiccentrality. The hero is usually a half-feminine ingénu, as in Stendhal’s The Redand the Black (1830) and The Charterhouse of Parma (1839). Women are older or ofhigher rank, following Rousseau and Goethe. Stendhal’s androgyny is adolescentmalleability or naiveté, ripe for disillusion. His pretty phrases for JulienSorel are adopted by Balzac for the girlish Eugène de Rastignac. A line oftransmission is clear to Flaubert’s The Sentimental Education (written 1843–45),where one feels the impact of Decadent Late Romanticism. Flaubert’s FrédéricMoreau has a homoerotic intimacy and a perverse attraction to a Dianalikedominatrix, a woman in military dress. The culminating sexual debacle ofFrédéric’s flight from a brothel confirms Flaubert’s definition of androgyny asarrested adolescence. The story goes full circle in returning the hero from hisadventures among women to his primary but socially regressive union with a malefriend.The French novel’s adolescent androgyne is not the ideal persona of HighRomanticism, where sexual duality signifies imaginative range and power. Julienand Frédéric have sensibility but not imagination. They achieve nothingpermanent. They contemplate neither their own souls nor the great realities ofnature and culture. Once again, the laws of the social novel consignhermaphroditism to a realm of limitation, where it represents only weakness andinefficacy, potentiality falling short of realization. The English social novel,mastered by so many women writers, is less concerned with the adolescent male asa character type and less indulgent toward his misapprehensions anddisappointments. Stendhal’s and Flaubert’s self-projection into their unluckyheroes is tinged with satire, like Byron’s ironic affection for his fresh-facedDon Juan.Flaubert said of the heroine of his best novel (1857), “Madame Bovary, c’estmoi!” She contains his spiritual struggles and sexual contradictions. Baudelairefelt “a virile spirit” still present in “this bizarre androgyne,” who “remains aman.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note11a] The motherless Emma sketches Minerva (aself-portrait?), wears masculine accessories, dresses as a man at a ball. GastonBachelard says, “The literary creation of a woman by a man or of a man by awoman are burning creations.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note12a] Madame Bovarycarries Flaubert’s adolescent Romantic dreams. She is one of the social novel’sgreat misinterpreters of reality, demanding life’s slow, bland routine yield afantasia of ecstasy and sensation. Reality, never excluded for long in thisgenre; must finally close about her. Anna Karenina (1873–76), Tolstoy’s versionof Madame Bovary, pits another willful adulteress against social constraint.Emma’s latent masculinity survives in Anna’s severe black-velvet ball dress andin the tendency of women to fall “in love with” or “lose their hearts” to her.13[ch25_notes.html#ch17note13a] Society wins; the heroines are defeated. Thesuicides of Emma, Anna, and Vergil’s Dido may function as an exorcistic divorceof the writer’s adult male persona from the mesmerizing female persona of hisinner life, a shadow of mother and memory.All these themes of sexual duality and deviance are gathered together in EmileZola’s Nana (1880). Just as Becky Sharp is a brasher Emma Woodhouse, so is Nanaa more perverse Bovary and Karenina. The sexual outlaw has graduated fromadultery to prostitution. Nana is queen of Parisian courtesans. She is a Venus,an Amazon, a “maneater,” a monster resting her feet on “human skulls.” Nanaintensifies the ambivalences of the earlier nineteenth-century heroines. Shetakes a jealous lesbian lover, picks up girls, and dons male disguise to visitbrothels to “watch scenes of debauchery to relieve her boredom.” Zola imagineshis great androgyne as the enemy of civilization. She is “a force of nature, aferment of destruction, unwittingly corrupting and disorganizing Paris betweenher snow-white thighs.” He sees her “dominating the city” from “the horizon ofvice.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note14a] Nana has Decadent elements fromBaudelaire, Huysmans, and Moreau, but as a social novel it must redeem thesocial order from its enslavement to this titanic hermaphrodite, high priestessof mother nature. Like St. Augustine, Zola condemns the Great Mother as theWhore of Babylon. The book ends with a tour de force of Decadent description, anearly geological analysis of the loathsome face of Nana’s corpse suppuratingwith smallpox, nature undoing its consummate creation.Thus even in the French novel, where nineteenth-century society is banal andconformist, the androgyne is always disciplined for the social whole. Comparethe vampire hierarchs of Nana and Christabel. Zola’s voracious femme fatale isdestroyed by the very archetypal forces she invokes. But Coleridge’s malignGeraldine, a High Romantic androgyne, gets out of her poem intact. In fact, whenwe part from the unfinished Christabel, Geraldine is still gaining in power. Andnothing can check the Late Romantic vampires of Baudelaire and Huysmans. In itsnegativity toward the archetypal female, the social novel agrees with epic:androgyny destabilizes the public structures of history.The first novels of Emily and Charlotte Brontë, published the same year, revivedout-of-fashion Gothic style. They share rugged, brooding heroes and a wildatmosphere of mystery and gloom. But the books belong to different genres.Despite sex-reversing moments, Charlotte’s Jane Eyre is a social novel governedby public principles of intelligibility. It records the worldly progress of aningénue from childhood to maturity, culminating in marriage. Emily’s WutheringHeights, on the other hand, is High Romantic, its sources of energy outsidesociety and its sex and emotion incestuous and solipsistic. The two Brontënovels differ dramatically in their crossing lines of identification. Charlottepalpably projects herself into her underprivileged but finally triumphantheroine, while Emily leaps across the borderline of gender into her savage hero.Critics have disagreed about nearly everything in Wuthering Heights. The storyis set in receding frames, pictures within pictures, darkening panes ofrelativity. Brontë’s jump-cuts from present to past were prophetic of laterdevelopments in the novel but irritated and confused many contemporary readers,who thought the book disorganized. Jane Eyre, in contrast, is content withtraditional chronological narration. Are there psychological reasons for EmilyBrontë’s formal innovations?Wuthering Heights’ central problem is the passionate attraction betweenCatherine Earnshaw and rough Heathcliff, with his “half-civilized ferocity.”15[ch25_notes.html#ch17note15a] This celebrated love story contains curious gapsof sexual affect, which the popular audience has bridged on its own. Emotion isa flash flood of turbulence, glutting the personae with amoral energies. Thereis tremendous emphasis on cruelty, brutality, and violence, which few criticsmanage to integrate into a balanced view of the novel. Most ignore the subjectaltogether, since sadism is incompatible with academic humanitarianism.Q. D. Leavis, for example, admits the presence of a violent “Learworld” inWuthering Heights but dismisses it as “due not to sadism or perversion in thenovelist… but to the Shakespearian intention.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note16a]David Cecil thinks the “fierceness and ruthlessness” of Brontë’s charactersexpress “the vitality of nature”: “Like the adherents of some primitive religionwe watch the Earth God stiffen in the death of winter; rise with youthmysteriously renewed to blossom in the spring.”17 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note17a]Nature does stand behind the novel, but it is nature as stormy masculine force,not as fertility or renewal. Dorothy van Ghent speaks of “the impulse todestruction” and “the inhuman excess” of Heathcliff and Catherine’s passion, “anexcess everywhere present in language—in verbs and modifiers and metaphors thatseethe with a brute fury.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note18a] Virginia Woolf says,“There is love, but it is not the love of men and women.”19[ch25_notes.html#ch17note19a] Cecil calls Catherine’s love “sexless,” “as devoidof sensuality as the attraction that draws the tide to the moon, the steel tothe magnet.” Cecil’s word “sexless” persists in commentary on the novel but hasso many possible meanings that critics misunderstand one another.Catherine tells her puzzled housekeeper, Nelly Dean, that she will marry Edgar,not Heathcliff, because she and Heathcliff are too alike: “He’s more myself thanI am…. Nelly, I am Heathcliff.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note20a] Such love,arising from a sense of identity rather than difference, is beyond gender. Theresemblances between Heathcliff and Catherine are literal. She is as violent andvengeful as he. A hoyden of “fiery temper” who demands a whip as a gift, she isalways attacking people and knocking them about. Catherine and Heathcliff sufferemotion as physical paroxysms. Both grind their teeth in fits of temper and dashtheir heads against hard objects. In one of her episodes of “maniac’s fury,”Catherine tears up a pillow with her teeth, scattering feathers like a foxshaking a chicken. One of the novel’s first sympathetic commentators, EmileMontégut, declares, “He and she are, so to speak, but a single person; togetherthey form a hybrid monster, twin-sexed and twin-souled; he is the male soul ofthe monster, she the female.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note21a] The metaphor comesfrom French Decadent Late Romanticism; a High Romantic one might be better.Claire Rosenfield says, “Cathy and Heathcliff are themselves exact Doublesdiffering in sex alone.”22 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note22a] This love affair isEmily Brontë’s Romantic coalescence of the doubles.As a sexual persona, Heathcliff is modelled on Byron and specifically on Byron’sManfred, tormented with love for his sister. Wuthering Heights’ incest theme hasbeen long recognized but only sporadically discussed. Catherine and the orphanedHeathcliff grow up in the intimacy of brother and sister. Heathcliff could evenbe Earnshaw’s bastard son and hence Catherine’s half-brother. But critics havegotten the incest theme backwards by rationalizing it without regard for itsHigh Romantic sources. Heathcliff and Catherine cannot marry, some claim,because of an implicit incest taboo. Yet as we have seen, incest is soindispensable to Romantic consciousness that even when a sibling does not exist,as in Shelley, he or she must be invented. Incest is not a danger to be shunnedbut a royal empowerment of imagination.Heathcliff and Catherine’s love is inflamed, not checked by their fraternaltwinship. Their love can be called sexless, since carnal intercourse is notdesired. Romantic union is a conflation of soul-images, mirrored self-love. InManfred, genital contact is an error, a demeaning literalization. It is theirmad striving for an impossible union which makes Heathcliff and Catherine’s lastmeeting, on the day of her death, so astonishing a moment in fiction. The twoembrace with wild, bruising convulsions. The scene is less love than ritualcombat. H. J. Rose says the arousal of excitement in ancient ceremonies was tocreate magical energy or power. Heathcliff and Catherine are like the Oresteia’sbrother and sister, rhythmically working themselves into a hyperstate oflove-hate. Behind Emily Brontë’s long thrilling scene I feel Shelley’s fusionwith his sister-spirit at the climax of Epipsychidion. There the fictivesiblings beat, burn, and boil in a mystic welter of water and fire. Shelleycalls the poem “an antenatal dream,” regressing through history. But theApollonian Epipsychidion swerves from the gross facts of primitive experience.It is Emily Brontë who completes the High Romantic quest for incest. WutheringHeights recreates the daemonism of the primeval incest-realm. Hence the book’suniversal sadism.The cluttered family romance of Wuthering Heights is predicated on Romantichistory-reversal. Eric Solomon correctly sees that “Emily Brontë casts a vagueincestuous aura” over the whole story: “Heathcliff marries his lost love’ssister-in-law; his wife’s son marries her brother’s daughter; Cathy’s daughtermarries her brother’s son.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note23a] Major criticismoverlooks the novel’s atmosphere of sexual claustrophobia, the vast turns ofcathexis back upon itself from one generation to the next. The incestuousintroversion is reinforced by repetition of names or echoes of names:Heathcliff, Hindley, Hareton, Linton, There is an elder and younger Catherineand an elder and younger Linton (surname and first name). C. P. Sanger’soft-reproduced genealogical chart (1926) may mislead by implying there is aclarity of characterization in Wuthering Heights accessible to any diligentreader. Family identity is fluid in Romantic literature. Hindley, Hareton,Linton: the rabbity names breed and slide into each other, helplessly retractingto an embryonic state. The generations do not really progress in WutheringHeights. They are irresistibly called back to their origins, for in Romantic sexand emotion, the future is only a misty emanation of the past.One of Wuthering Heights’ most powerful achievements is its surging matrix ofgenetically homologous identities. Only the heart of the book is in psychosexualflux. The guardians of the narrative frame, pragmatic Nelly Dean and fatuousLockwood, are sharply delineated characters. I gave the name allegoricalrepletion to this style of representation, which I see in Leonardo’s The Virginand Child with St. Anne and Rossetti’s Bower Meadow and Astarte Syriaca.Allegorical repletion is the filling up of fictive space with a single identityappearing simultaneously in different forms, juxtaposed like facets of a jewel.In allegorical repletion, a dominating personality is extended throughpsychological space. Heathcliff and Catherine seek sadomasochistic annihilationof their separate identities. Their desire to collapse into one another producesa gigantic spirit-body in the text, preventing other family members fromattaining normal size. A social novel progresses systematically toward characterdifferentiation. The personae of Jane Eyre, for example, become increasinglydistinct as they develop or reveal a secret past. But Wuthering Heights movesthe other way. As a Romantic work, it blurs even generational differences at itscore, toward which personae and events sink back by centripetal compulsion.Heathcliff and Catherine’s incestuous alliance does not, as might be expected,compete with a normal marriage. Wuthering Heights has a dark and a light hero,an unusual “male version,” Frye observes, of the nineteenth-century motif ofdark and light heroines in Scott, Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville.24[ch25_notes.html#ch17note24a] Femininity lingers in Edgar Linton, swarthyHeathcliff’s timid blonde rival. Edgar is “the soft thing,” with a sweet“soft-featured face” and “too graceful” a figure.25[ch25_notes.html#ch17note25a] As a wife, Catherine is dominant; her will is law.Heathcliff and Catherine’s hermaphrodite doubling is therefore opposed by Edgarand Catherine’s hermaphrodite marriage, where sex roles are reversed.Wuthering Heights follows the psychosexual geography of Shakespeare’s Antony andCleopatra. Thrushcross Grange, the Linton estate, is like Caesar’s Rome, arespectable world of static social personae. The Earnshaws’ Wuthering Heights,like Cleopatra’s Egypt, is a realm of raw natural energy and uncontrolledmetamorphoses. Romantic heights are sublime, exalted, extreme. A grange isnature managed, contained, agrarian, aptly symbolized by a crossing thrush, apretty unpredatory bird. In Shakespeare, the hero must choose between twoopposed worlds, but in Brontë it is the heroine. Returning from her stay atThrushcross Grange, Catherine is the street-reveller Cleopatra turned intosedate Octavia: “Instead of a wild, hatless little savage jumping into thehouse, and rushing to squeeze us all breathless, there lighted from a handsomeblack pony a very dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the coverof a feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold upwith both hands that she might sail in.” Her decorous new persona is gained atgreat loss of vitality. Emblem of the Grange is what Heathcliff calls “thevacant blue eyes of the Lintons.”26 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note26a] The Lintonsare blonde sky-gods representing, like Shakespeare’s Caesar, a stolid, aridApollonianism. Their eyes are vacant because blind to the dark, roiling realm ofHeathcliff’s Dionysian nature-force. The Grange is sheltered from the stormsthat blast and flatten vegetation on the Heights. This hostile landscape of“bleak winds and bitter northern skies” is the novel’s master stroke. Winter atWuthering Heights invades and surmounts summer. Here is Brontë’s mostsignificant departure from High Romanticism, where nature even at its mosttumultuous is usually an inexhaustible well of fertility. For her, nature isprimarily force, not nurturance. She creates, in other words, a nature without amother.Wuthering Heights systematically revises its Romantic sources. It transfersEpipsychidion’s incestuous meeting of twin-souls from contemplative to activeand from spiritual to material. Shelley’s Emilia is a cloudy “Angel” or “Seraphof Heaven,” but Catherine, who identifies her love for Heathcliff with “theeternal rocks,” dreams happily of being expelled from heaven by the angels.Wuthering Heights is Epipsychidion with nature written in. Brontë treats Byronsimilarly, by rerooting him—or rather his famed persona of glamourous will—moredeeply in the natural. In Heathcliff there is now a direct passage betweenByronism and natural power, for in Byron’s poetry, nature serves largely aslyrical background. With his “sharp cannibal teeth” and “the expression of avicious cur,” Heathcliff stands at the border of the human. Birds build theirnest near him, mistaking him for “a piece of timber.”27[ch25_notes.html#ch17note27a] Brontë’s sharpest correction is of Wordsworth.Wuthering Heights, written at the zenith of Victorian nature-worship, envisionsa cosmos of Coleridgean cruelty. Brontë barbarizes Wordsworth, transforming hisserene, majestic testimony of moral cooperation between man and nature into aharsh prose ode heaving with subterranean disturbances. The novel is asadomasochistic swirl of primitive noise and motion, the rending and tearing ofDionysian sparagmos, which is only made tolerable or even intelligible by thebrilliant distancing device of the nesting narrative frames.Wuthering Heights is a catalog of chthonian horrors, each a Coleridgean affrontto Wordsworthian benevolence. It is full of outbreaks of violence and luridimaginings of death and torture. We witness or hear of whipping, slapping,thrashing, cuffing, wrenching, pinching, scratching, hair-pulling, gouging,kicking, trampling, and the hanging of dogs. Hindley hopes his horse will “kickout” Heathcliff’s brains. Catherine, bitten by a dog, would not cry out even “ifshe had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow.” Isabella shrieks “as if witcheswere running redhot needles into her.” Heathcliff ponders “flinging Joseph offthe highest gable, and painting the housefront with Hindley’s blood.” He throwsa tureen of hot applesauce in Edgar’s face. Hindley shoves a carving knifebetween Nelly’s teeth and threatens to push it down her throat. Nelly fearsHeathcliff “smashing Hareton’s skull on the steps.” Heathcliff says of Edgar,“I’ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut!” The moment Catherine ceasedloving Edgar, “I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood!” “I have nopity!” Heathcliff cries. “The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crushout their entrails!” Isabella says Heathcliff is adept at “pulling out thenerves with red hot pincers”; he seized her heart, “pinched it to death,” andflung it back to her. He hurls a dinner knife at her, cutting open her neck.Discovering Hindley’s body, he says, “Flaying and scalping would not havewakened him.” On and on. The reader may feel, with Catherine, “A thousandsmiths’ hammers are beating in my head!”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note28a]Virtuosity of sadistic speech pours from all the characters, not justHeathcliff. Even affable Nelly Dean speaks this primitive language. The novel’ssadistic eloquence ultimately belongs to Emily Brontë herself, who may havelearned her cascading curses from raging Cleopatra. Sometimes the cruelty isquite subtle. When Catherine falls ill with fever, Mrs. Linton visits WutheringHeights to nurse her, then insists on taking her to Thrushcross Grange toconvalesce. Nelly recalls: “But the poor dame had reason to repent of herkindness; she, and her husband, both took the fever, and died within a few daysof each other.”29 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note29a] The sudden exit of the elderLintons always inspires me with admiring laughter. They die so fast we nearlyhear their bodies hitting the floor, like Coleridge’s sailors dropping to thedeck. We are meant to notice Catherine’s spoiled self-absorption, thoughtlesslyleaving ruin in her wake, like Cleopatra veering off from Actium. But the twodeaths also demonstrate the fatality of the liaison of Heathcliff and Catherine,who give off a kind of chthonian miasma, infecting and devastating the socialworld. This is one of the blatantly anti-Wordsworthian moments in WutheringHeights. The Lintons’ generosity, hospitality, and humane emotion are harshlyanswered by Emily Brontë’s nature-as-destroyer. It is the author as sniper,playfully cutting down her characters from an invisible height. She is ArtemisHecaerge, “the far-shooter,” “she who works from afar.”From the least to the most obvious cruelty: Lockwood’s terrible dream ofCatherine’s ghost. Oddly, it is rarely discussed. Yet it is the psychologicallymost central thing in the novel, coming directly from Brontë’s earliestinspiration. Rummaging through mildewed books at Wuthering Heights, Lockwooddrifts off to sleep. He is disturbed by the rattling of a fir-bough against thewindow:“I must stop it, nevertheless!” I muttered, knocking my knuckles through theglass, and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch: instead ofwhich, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little ice-cold hand!The intense horror of nightmare came over me; I tried to draw back my arm, butthe hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed,“Let me in—let me in!”“Who are you?” I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.“Catherine Linton,” it replied shiveringly (why did I think of Linton? I hadread Earnshaw twenty times for Linton), “I’m come home, I’d lost my way on themoor!”As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child’s face looking through thewindow—terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt shaking thecreature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to and frotill the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes: still it wailed, “Let me in!”and maintained its tenacious gripe, almost maddening with fear.“How can I!” I said at length. “Let me go, if you want me to let you in!”The fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the booksup in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentableprayer.I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour, yet the instant Ilistened, again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!“Begone!” I shouted, “I’ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.”“It’s twenty years,” mourned the voice, “twenty years, I’ve been a waif fortwenty years!”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note30a]The wrist rubbed on broken glass is one of the most frightful images inliterature, for it involves the torture of a child. Coleridgean-Byronic EmilyBrontë is settling Wordsworth’s hash. By drafting the pedestrian Lockwood intothis bloody pagan spectacle, she demonstrates the innateness of sadism. Thedreamer’s primitive instinct for self-preservation bursts through the mask ofgood manners and social custom. A man who would normally tenderly clasp or kissa lady’s hand tries to hack it off. The traveller Lockwood makes a Wordsworthianjourney back to nature and finds himself in his own daemonic heart of darkness,containing not compassion but barbarism. The scene has a wonderful dream-logic.For example, the ghost’s arm is a fir-bough because wild Catherine has beenreabsorbed into nature. Self-destructive in life, she is a speaking tree fromDante’s wood of the suicides. Lockwood therefore runs her wrist across jaggedglass because he is sawing a branch.Why does Catherine appear as a child, yet give her married name of Linton? MarkKinkead-Weekes suggests, “Cathy and Heathcliff are fixed in a mode of beingforged in childhood.”31 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note31a] Incest, I said, isregression through history back to nature. The spool of time is rewound. Theghost of the emotionally undeveloped Catherine takes prepubescent form andlingers at a window symbolizing the borderline between childhood and adulthood.“A child’s face looking through the window”: Lockwood sees Catherine eternallyreliving her last moment of perfect union with Heathcliff, as they peer into theLintons’ window at plush Thrushcross Grange, after which she disappears intothat world and comes back changed forever. Her daughter is also named CatherineLinton. Therefore the elder Catherine, who dies in childbirth, is usurping theidentity of her own child, like Poe’s vampiristic Morella.Why does the ghost want to come in? Shrewd Emily Brontë anticipates herVictorian audience’s misreading of this passage, into which it would project aBlakean and Dickensian pathos. The ghost must be a tattered orphan begging forshelter. But the sadistic passions of Wuthering Heights shake this humanitariancomplacency. Lockwood understands the ghost’s desire better even than modernreaders. He later tells Heathcliff, “If the little fiend had got in at thewindow, she probably would have strangled me!”32 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note32a]Archaic religious ritual mollified the roving spirits of the dead. Ancestorworship is really ancestor propitiation, a “warding off.” A ghost wants to enterin order to drink the blood of the living. Catherine’s ghost seizes Lockwood’shand to live again at his expense. Pugnacious Catherine Earnshaw, at the ageassumed by her ghost, was never so defenseless and pitiable a child. Thereforewe must conclude that the ghost has adopted a rusing persona, like Coleridge’svampire Geraldine, who pretends to faint in order to win entrance toChristabel’s castle. Brontë’s primal dream-scene, with its blood-soakedbedclothes, is an exercise in Coleridgean seduction. Marriage to nature is onceagain rape and defloration. We, as much as Lockwood, are raped and lose ourinnocence here. Brontë revises every Wordsworthian assumption into daemonic sexand violence. All this is true even if the ghost is a dream rather than asupernatural visitation, for Catherine has invaded Lockwood’s mind,materializing herself in his dream-life through Ligeia-like force of will. Thebooks that Lockwood piles against her are the barrier of rationalism. But inWuthering Heights, as in Emily Brontë’s short life, daemonic divinationprevails.In Romanticism, we have seen, the masculine is always qualified or impaired, aprinciple applying to Wuthering Heights for new and startling reasons. Thedifference between Heathcliff and Edgar first seems, in street terms, thedifference between a real man and a sissy. But Heathcliff, a force of naturebeginning with his craggy name, is strangely infertile. His marriage to Edgar’ssister produces no vigorous offspring. Quite the opposite, the weak blood of theLintons surmounts his, resulting in “a pale, delicate, effeminate boy,” feebleand sickly, “more a lass than a lad.” Heathcliff contemptuously rebukes his son:“Thou art thy mother’s child, entirely! Where is my share in thee, pulingchicken?”33 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note33a] There is some impediment to thetransmission of virile energy in Heathcliff. He is seminally vitiated. His powerflows not into heterosexual generation but into incestuous passion for hisdouble. Sadomasochism cuts two ways, aggression moving out and in. Like Byronand Elvis Presley, Heathcliff suffers internal self-impairment. Appearances andreputation to the contrary, Heathcliff as a sexual persona is not conventionallymasculine. Another law of Romanticism is that it is a mode of self-projection.Every Romantic work is organized by a shadowy speculative persona, through whomthe artist searches for a new alignment of nature and psyche. Popular sentimentwould link Emily Brontë with Catherine Earnshaw, enamoured of the dark Byronichero who is the author’s wish-fulfillment fantasy. Major criticism neverindulges in such reveries, partly because of the textual absolutism of thenow-old New Criticism. But the reluctance to ask biographical questions aboutWuthering Heights produced the present impasse, with many moral and sexualissues unresolved.My theory is this: Heathcliff is one of the great hermaphrodite sexual personaeof Romanticism, a dream-representation of Emily Brontë as naturalized Byron. TheBrontë Gothic novels intersect, for Charlotte retains her gender in her storywhile Emily, like Coleridge in Christabel, abandons hers. Much commentaryadvances the traditional but preposterous thesis that Heathcliff is modelled onBranwell Brontë, only male of six siblings at Haworth Parsonage. Walter L. Reed,for example, declares, “That there was some connection between Branwell and thefigure of Heathcliff is evident.”34 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note34a] But this hasbeen a mistaken idea from the start. In terms of sexual personae, Branwell wasthe complete antithesis of the active, vehement, imperious Heathcliff.Physically stunted, self-indulgent, finally dying an opium addict, Branwellbelonged to the category of dreamy, vacillating, degenerated manhood typified bythe real-life Coleridge and by Poe’s Usher.Branwell is a distracting superfluity to any discussion of the genesis ofWuthering Heights, for Emily Brontë herself, by overwhelming evidence, possessedall the masculinity necessary for the creation of her great hero. CharlotteBrontë calls her dead sister “stronger than a man, simpler than a child.” Shehad “a secret power and fire that might have informed the brain and kindled theveins of a hero”: “Her temper was magnanimous, but warm and sudden; her spiritaltogether unbending.”35 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note35a] Elsewhere, Charlottespeaks of “a certain harshness in her powerful and peculiar character.” Branwellwas barely five feet tall, while Emily was the tallest family member aside fromher father. Haworth townsfolk said Emily was “more like a boy than a girl.” Shelooked “loose and boyish when she slouched over the moors, whistling to herdogs, and taking long strides.” The word “masculine” recurs in local memories ofEmily. Her family nickname was “the Major.” Monsieur Héger, the Brusselsprofessor, said, “She should have been a man.” Charlotte said of George Eliot’slover, “Lewes’ face almost moves me to tears, it is so wonderfully likeEmily’s.” But George Henry Lewes was called “the ugliest man in England”! In amushy, fictionalized biography (1936) suggesting a connection between Emily andHeathcliff, Virginia Moore finds Emily’s “self-identification with men” even inthe family Gondal games, where her sister Anne chose feminine roles.36[ch25_notes.html#ch17note36a]We are confronted here, as in the case of Emily Dickinson, with the paradox of awoman of Romantic genius. We saw that the Romantic poet, finding the westernmale persona too limited, hermaphroditizes himself to seize the Delphic powersof feminine receptivity. But a female artist, sexually advantaged by birth, mustextend her imperial reach in the other direction, toward the masculine. I notedthat gigantism in a female artist is self-masculinizing. My examples areWuthering Heights and Rosa Bonheur’s vast painting Horse Fair (1853–55), whichabolishes female internality in a surging tableau of hard animal dynamism.Heathcliff has Horse Fair’s polemical muscularity. Charlotte Brontë callsHeathcliff “colossal,” for he is charged with an excess of sex-crossingaspiration. Two other great women writers, alluding to Wuthering Heights,independently think of the word “gigantic.” Emily Dickinson hails “giganticEmily Brontë,” and Virginia Woolf says Brontë’s “gigantic ambition is to be feltthroughout the novel.”37 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note37a] Gigantism isoverreaching, a fascist claim to universal power. Gigantism is theself-electrifying strategy of a woman defying the insulting dictatorship ofgender.Heathcliff’s seminal weakness betrays his transsexual origins. He is a womanwith a man’s energy but without a man’s potency. By denying her Byronic hero aconsummate virility, Emily Brontë shows that she sees through Lord Byron’sseducer’s mask and discerns his Romantic hermaphroditism. An artist’s intuition:Goethe and Balzac similarly show Byron as half-feminine Euphorion and bisexualLord Dudley, progenitor of androgynes. Yet Byron’s international reputation forgrand machismo persisted until G. Wilson Knight’s modern studies.Emily Brontë’s Romantic self-portrait as Byron is an example of my principle ofsexual metathesis, an artistic sex change. Examples are Byron’s transformationof choirboy John Edleston into Thyrza, Proust’s of Alfred Agostinelli intoAlbertine, and Virginia Woolf’s of Victoria Sackville-West into Orlando. Itwould be vulgar to reduce sexual metathesis to fear of homosexual scandal. Anampler spiritual economy is at work. Sexual metathesis is a metaphysicaladvance, an expansion of identity through a mentally prolonged erotic sensation.The real-life original is like a sexual word translated into new imaginativelanguage. The sexual metathesis operating in Wuthering Heights, like that inColeridge’s Christabel, is directed toward the self rather than a charismaticother. It arises from the artist’s desire to vivify and eternalize his or heressential but socially forbidden identity. Sackville-West participated in bothmodes of sexual metathesis. In her novel Challenge (1924), she is the heroJulian Davenant, the same persona she assumed to wander the Paris streets inmale dress with her lover, Violet Trefusis.Wuthering Heights falls stylistically into two parts. John Berryman remarks,“What you remember as the book is only the first half of the book.” V. S.Pritchett calls the last part “unevenly felt.”38 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note38a] Ithink the novel suffers tremendous loss of intensity, and I see a parallel toChristabel and Orlando, which fall off in power because of what I callpsychoiconicism. All three works are ruled by a “fascination” of personality,which crowds the narrative space and dwarfs the other personae. Orlando’sfictive energy comes from Woolf imagining Victoria Sackville-West as a man.When, halfway through, Orlando turns into a woman—that is, when Vita becomessimply herself—the life goes out of the book. We know from her diary that, afterbeginning in a feverish “rapture” of inspiration, Woolf lost interest in Orlandoand had to struggle “listlessly” to complete it.39 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note39a]And frankly, the book’s brilliant idea, of a hermaphrodite time-travellerembodying each great phase of English literature, is poorly executed. It mayhave been Woolf’s scorn for masculine intellectual history that crippled her andmade what should have been the wittiest of her books into one of the mosttedious.Hermaphroditic declension produces the weak second half of Wuthering Heights andOrlando. I found the pattern twice in Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister: when the Amazongains a social name, her glamour fades; when Mignon abandons male dress, sheweakens and dies. Wuthering Heights declines with the diminution of Heathcliff’sarchetypal force. He becomes a naturalistic character, a country squire andtyrannical paterfamilias. He loses his aura of glamour, the uncannyscintillation of the author’s identification. Emily Brontë has absented herself.She dutifully finishes the scheme she has designed, but it is like Vasaripainting over Leonardo’s battle mural. Wuthering Heights flattens into a socialnovel and leaves its lurid Romantic irrationalism behind.Why the sudden reduction of scale and style? Emily Brontë’s sexual metathesisinto Heathcliff is inseparable from the incestuous-twin theme. Heathcliff isconceived as one end of an erotic polarity. If Brontë enters her novel as a man,then her feeling for the vanished Catherine is homosexual. Moore points out thatEmily left home for three months to study at a girls’ school, then abruptlyreturned to write passionate love poems full of treachery and revenge. Mooresuggests there could have been no opportunity at so sequestered a Victorianinstitution to fall in love with anyone except another girl. I find in many ofBrontë’s lyrics a delicate lesbian eroticism focusing on the night approach ofangelic female spirits with long silken hair. There is persistent imagery ofsmoothness and softness, of enamoured watching and hushed, eerie nearness.40[ch25_notes.html#ch17note40a] Like Christina Rossetti’s strange dream-poemGoblin Market (1862), with its embowered sister-sensuality and lush, fruitydangers, Brontë’s poetry may reflect a premodern sexual state, inflamed butcelibate. Visionary nuns have lived in this exalted condition for a thousandyears. Emily Brontë seeks clairvoyance, not orgasm, a burning vapor of ghostlycathexis.Wuthering Heights’ lapse in energy is virtually simultaneous with Catherine’sdeath. As in Christabel, the second half quickens only when the eroticconnection of the first half is reinvoked as memory. That the novel begins withsuch force is surely due to Catherine’s spectral epiphany before terrifiedLockwood. Heathcliff himself, throwing open the window and sobbing into thenight, is denied this vision. If Heathcliff is Brontë, then Catherine is a womanfrom whom there has been an irrevocable separation. The mysterious inspirer ofardor at the girls’ school is relatively inconsequential. That person was merelythe shadow of another. Family romance shapes all our erotic lives, but for theRomantic, family romance is artistic destiny. Haworth townsfolk said Emily andAnne were “like twins, inseparable companions,” publicly intertwined. But thecrucial sibling was Maria. Of the ghost’s complaint that she has been “a waiffor twenty years,” David Daiches asks: “Is it relevant that Maria, theprecocious eldest of the Brontë sisters who had taken over the guidance of herlittle brother and sisters on her mother’s death when she was barely eight yearsold, had died twenty years before Emily wrote this chapter? We know how thememory of this devoted elder sister, who had died at the age of twelve, hauntedboth Emily and Charlotte Brontë.”41 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note41a] Branwellclaimed he heard Maria’s voice crying outside the windows at night. But notethis places Branwell in the position of simpering Lockwood, not Heathcliff, whofrantically longs to hear the voice but cannot. We must believe, therefore, thatCatherine contains some aspect of Maria, erotically transformed.In Wuthering Heights, Maria becomes the incestuous Romantic sister-spirit toEmily’s male poetic genius. Byron’s life and work are recreated. His homosexualliaisons and incest with his half-sister are fused in Brontë’s submerged lesbianincest. Then Manfred, with its half-mad incestuous recluse mourning for a deadsister, is reproduced in Emily-as-Heathcliff convulsively mourning forMaria-as-Catherine. The sister’s phantom makes a terrifying appearance in bothManfred and Wuthering Heights. Brontë even reimagines the cup upon whose brimManfred hallucinates his sister’s blood. For what is the jagged windowpanerubbing Catherine’s wrist if not a bloody rim? Both grisly images suggestsymbolic sexual injury. Maria is Emily’s sacrificial Muse. The Muse or anima,the soul’s repressed and projected feminine half, is she who comes from outside.Emily Brontë, stern, sudden, and austere, is masculine in relation to a hoveringfemale fructification. The ghost tapping at the window, whether lost lesbianbeloved or lamented late sister, is a girl who is a haunting memory, who pressesat the portals of consciousness. Lockwood fears the ghost as a strangler (theroot-meaning of “Sphinx”). The ghost is therefore a vampire-spirit like lesbianGeraldine, who makes a night visit to Coleridge-Christabel and seals her lips insilence. Love and fear, desire and hostility: sexual metathesis is Brontë’sself-healing pagan magic.Emily Brontë suffered three abandonments by women, each an echo of the others.First her mother, who died when Emily was three. Next Maria, who died when Emilywas seven. Finally, Miss X, the teen siren, who, if one can extrapolate fromEmily’s already fixed emotional pattern of loss, was probably a cool customer.The family romance of Haworth Parsonage was structured by ritualized sexualexchange. Unlike Wordsworth and Woolf, Emily Brontë did not respond to amother’s death with a compensatory Cybele-myth of creative natural process. Onthe contrary, she strips Wordsworthian maternalism from nature because of herown alienation from the procreative, which she purges from her body through herself-desexualization as Heathcliff. In other words, the nature without a motherin Wuthering Heights is a swerve from the self. The novel promulgates anature-cult without a goddess. Frazer says the high priest of Cybele “drew bloodfrom his arms” as an offering to the goddess; then the assisting priests,whirling about “with waggling heads and streaming hair” and “rapt into a frenzyof excitement and insensible to pain,” slashed their bodies with potsherds andknives “in order to bespatter the altar and the sacred tree with their flowingblood.”42 [ch25_notes.html#ch17note42a] This resembles the slitting of theghost’s wrist (on pottery-like glass shards) and the “splashes of blood aboutthe bark of the tree” against which Heathcliff dashes his head.43[ch25_notes.html#ch17note43a] Catherine and Heathcliff are self-maiming priestsof a pagan cult of unmaternal stormy nature.It strains credulity to suppose the ineffectual, weak-willed Branwell Brontë hadany part in the formulation of this severe world-view, which was the product ofEmily Brontë’s uncompromising half-male imagination. Branwell’s position inHaworth family romance was far less impressive. He was the spoiled baby and runtof the litter. If there was a symbiotic twin-connection between him and Emily,it may have resided in her sense that she had somehow stolen her brother’smasculinity, an embezzlement of funds from one account to another in the samegenetic bank. Emily caught cold at Branwell’s funeral, refused rest and medicalaid, and died shortly thereafter, a sequence suggesting a rite of guilt andatonement. Did she feel her supreme imaginative success had been at herbrother’s expense, that she had usurped his gender for her own amoral purposes?Her behavior is exactly like Heathcliff’s when, to unite with Catherine beyondthe grave, he wills his death by spurning food and sleep. Thus Emily Brontëmerged with her mighty hero, taking his ascesis for her own. Her final daysspoke her hostility to the body. In Epipsychidion, as in the Symposium, love’sfeverish battle is a quest for primeval unity. But Wuthering Heights, with itsbuffeting embraces, contains a more perverse psychodrama: the body as the basisof gender is an affront to imagination and emotion, which in Emily Brontë ishomosexual-tending. It is this body, an obscuring material veil, that is torn bythe novel’s sadomasochism.I submit that the formal innovations of Wuthering Heights came from Brontë’s owndisplacements of identity. The mediation through two limited narrators and theshifts of time and point of view are layers of intercession between a real andfictive self. Brontë’s apparent self-removal from Wuthering Heights conceals herenormous centrality to it, her projection into Heathcliff, produced by herself-removal from gender. If Rousseau is the first to assign himself a sexualidentity, Emily Brontë is the first to treat her sexual identity as anabstraction dwelling apart in another dimension of space and time. The brilliantnarrative frame came into being because Brontë was so distantly self-regarding.Nelly Dean and Lockwood represent the social norm, contemplating Heathcliff withimpatience or incomprehension. These lesser observers show Brontë’s maturelymeasured sense of herself and her projected persona. She is in double relationto her hermaphrodite hero, in whom she is simultaneously present and absent.Wuthering Heights goads the reader with questions: “Is Mr. Heathcliff a man? Ifso, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil?” “Is he a ghoul, or a vampire?” Thesepartial opinions have an eerie incandescence in sexual terms: “I did not feel asif I were in the company of a creature of my own species.” “He’s a lying fiend,a monster, and not a human being!” “He’s only half a man—not so much.”44[ch25_notes.html#ch17note44a] Heathcliff, toward whom we are moved by theseunjust exclamations, is a monster and not a man insofar as he is a womantransfigured into a hero.Coalescing with her Romantic double, Emily Brontë died the year after WutheringHeights was published and poorly received. Art was not enough. Like her Romanticprecursors, Brontë is not a social historian but the writer of one great poem,that is, one body of self-referential work. It is possible, therefore, thatWuthering Heights, because of its fully realized hermaphroditic inner action,would have had no sequel. Its extremism may have been career-ending. The novel’sinternal decline is Brontë’s own. In the second half, the monumentality ofHeathcliff/Catherine dwindles to a thin pale light in which voices are heard asif from a distance. Romanticism is yielding to Victorianism, the pleasant,ordered present in which Emily Brontë refuses to dwell. Extending and revisingHigh Romanticism, she follows Byron, Shelley, and Keats in electing to dieyoung, at the height of imagination."},{"pageContent":"18ROMANTIC SHADOWSSwinburne and PaterIn Swinburne’s poetry, the paganism of Romanticism becomes totally overt.Swinburne creates English Late Romanticism by using French Decadence toreinforce Coleridge against Wordsworth. An admirer of Sade, Gautier, andBaudelaire, Swinburne restored to English literature the sexual frankness itlost after the eighteenth century. Though he had enormous influence on Englishliterature, he has virtually disappeared from the curriculum. Even Victorianpoetry courses tend to exclude his most lurid and to me most central poems. ButBaudelaire too is censored in French classes in American colleges. The reason isthat there is no accepted theory of Decadent art, a gap I am trying to fill. Therevolt against Swinburne after the fall of Wilde was part of the modernistdefection from classical tradition, which T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land wronglyshows in disarray. Swinburne demonstrates the great continuity of westernculture, that brazen union of pagan antiquity with imperial Hollywood. Swinburneis a Hollywood poet. His pagan sexual personae, Dolores and Faustine, areblazing projections of Decadent cinematics. Through his voice, the sensationalfemale superstar dominates space and time.Swinburne was a Decadent but not an aesthete. Unkempt and dishevelled, he had notaste whatever in the major or minor arts. The first English aesthete was WalterPater, whose publishing career began a year after Swinburne’s scandalous Poemsand Ballads (1866). Swinburne prepared the way for Pater in two ways. First,Swinburne’s poetry dissolves the Saxon solidity of English syntax by Decadentmoral suspension and French linearity, that glossy accentless flow whichBaudelaire makes a sinister murmur of entrancement. Second, Swinburne’s LateRomantic imagery daemonizes Shelley into a degenerate classicism. In otherwords, Swinburne uses Coleridge to corrupt Shelley. Swinburne’s paganism isHellenistic and neo-primitive. It is not the radiant idealism Shelley takes fromApollonian Athens. French Late Romanticism, I said, is predicated on worship ofobjets d’art, thanks to the pioneering Gautier’s transfer of perceptualrelations from the visual to the sexual realm. English Decadence is lessconcerned with objets, than with style, the self-consciously beautiful mode ofdiscourse of an epicene male persona.Swinburne sets Baudelaire’s Decadent vampires in Sade’s violent nature.Swinburne’s world surges with natural power, because English high culture wasand is incapable of continental contempt for nature. Even when defining it asnegative and destructive, the English artist, unlike the French, opens himselfto nature, a pattern we see in Coleridge, Emily Brontë, and Swinburne.Swinburne’s poetry demolishes Victorian society and plants matriarchy amidpatriarchy. Swinburne is a female monarchist. The title of his first publishedwork, The Queen-Mother (1861), boldly fuses sex and hierarchy. Recreating thearchaic mother-religions, Swinburne sweeps Christianity away, as Coleridge didin Christabel. Now earth-cult is given a new liturgy and body of prayer. HenceSwinburne’s peculiar incantatory style, parodied from the moment it appeared. Iwould defend that style, admired by so many young Englishmen, by arguing that inSwinburne the ritual origins of art are recovered and restored. Swinburne’spoetry shows paganism as it really was, not idleness and frolic but a severecode of ritual limitation, curbing the dangerous daemonism of sex and nature.Dolores, long and serpent-shot, demonstrates the cultic character of Swinburne’spoetry and its magnetic orientation toward female power. The poem begins: “Coldeyelids that hide like a jewel / Hard eyes that grow soft for an hour; / Theheavy white limbs, and the cruel / Red mouth like a venomous flower.” Cold, hardjewel eyes: Dolores is Baudelaire’s mineral and reptilian vampire. She isritualistically visualized by the Decadent catalog, that itemizing/atomizingstyle Gautier invented in A Night with Cleopatra. The erotic objectdisintegrates into parts. Dolores’ “heavy white limbs” float surreally into viewbetween eyes and red mouth, as if she were a broken statue. We are in a deadcity, a forest of fallen columns overrun by lizards and poison poppies. Thisopening sequence of cold luminous images recalls Shelley’s Epipsychidion:aggression of the poet’s eye leads to dissolution of the object and emotionaldissociation of the perceiver.“O mystic and sombre Dolores, / Our Lady of Pain”: this blasphemous epithet endsstanza after stanza. In form, Dolores is surely inspired by Baudelaire’s“Litanies of Satan.” Like Baudelaire, Swinburne appeals to hell rather thanheaven, but his goal is more radical. He removes himself from the Christianworld altogether by invoking an omnipotent goddess. Like Aubrey Beardsley’sSwinburnian Saint Rose of Lima, Dolores daemonizes the Virgin Mary, dispatchingher into the past to meet her ancient precursors, from whom sexuality was notyet divorced. Before American Catholicism snobbishly purged itself of ethnictraces, one of its splendors was the evening devotion and Litany of the BlessedMother. As the priest intoned each line in the dusky church, the congregationanswered with the muttered phrase “Pray for us,” a rumbling antiphony of gloomymajesty. In this hypnotic night ritual, one heard the buried pagan voice ofItalian Catholicism. Dolores systematically inverts the sacred epithets,creating an Anti-Mary, as Baudelaire’s Satan is Antichrist. Dolores is the Whoreof Babylon: “O garden where all men may dwell, / O tower not of ivory, butbuilded / By hands that reach heaven from hell; / O mystical rose of the mire.”Medieval Mary, the chaste walled garden, becomes the plundered bower of an urbanbrothel. Dolores is the arrogant tower, a self-made colossus rising fromprimeval mud to tear down heaven’s gate.In Swinburne as in Baudelaire, sex is not pleasure but torment. The ChristianMadonna is a Mater Dolorosa because she grieves for her martyred son. ButSwinburne’s “fierce and luxurious” Dolores is Our Lady of Pain not because shesuffers but because she brings suffering to male victims. She is “our Lady ofTorture,” whose “prophet, preacher, and poet” is the Marquis de Sade. The mild,merciful Virgin, the intercessor God cannot refuse, disappears into the GreatMother of the savage animal world. Dolores is “my sister, my spouse, and mymother.” Swinburne revises Shelley, steering him from Apollonian to chthonian byadding the mother to the incest-romance. Swinburne’s Great Mother, an incestuoustriad or matriarchal trinity, is no longer fecund. The “splendid and sterileDolores” enjoys “barren delights,” “things monstrous and fruitless.” Like Sade’smurderous mother nature and Baudelaire’s stony idols, Swinburne’s Doloresfrustrates the procreative, her solipsistic sensuality turning phenomena backupon themselves.Dolores is vaster in scale than Baudelaire’s vampire poems. Dolores istranstemporal: she is an eternal principle of evil and disorder, defilinghistory. Her power over the historical comes from Swinburne’s malice toward HighVictorian culture, with its imposing Roman synthesis of intellect andimperialism. The poem’s last half is a brilliant exercise in sexual syncretism,the favorite backwash of late phases of culture. Swinburne identifies Doloreswith rulers and gods, male and female, from ancient chronicles. She is wrathfulJehovah, scourging mankind. She is Nero, lighting his garden with live Christiantorches. She is Cybele, Astarte, Cotytto, Aphrodite, Venus. Dolores is likeIsis, of whom Frazer says, “Her attributes and epithets were so numerous that inthe hieroglyphics she is called ‘the many-named,’ ‘the thousand-named,’ and inGreek inscriptions, ‘the myriad-named.’”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note1a]Swinburne’s thousand-named Dolores is a daemonic Cosmic Woman, trampling malehistory beneath her feet. Her metamorphic identity seeps inexorably into place,mind, and word, contaminating both language and action.Faustine is another dark litany. In his defense of Poems and Ballads, Swinburnesays Faustine records “the transmigration of a single soul, doomed as though byaccident from the first to all evil and no good, through many ages and forms,but clad always in the same type of fleshly beauty.”2[ch25_notes.html#ch18note2a] Faustine is the vampire who cannot die, and herpoem has an insomniac obsessiveness. She is “A queen whose kingdom ebbs andshifts / Each week.” She has “bright heavy brows,” “white gloss and sheen.” Wineand poison, milk and blood mix in her lips, ever since “the devil threw dicewith God” for her. She loves games where men die, “As though the slain man’sblood and breath / Revived Faustine.” She vacations in late Rome: “All round thefoul fat furrows reeked, / Where blood sank in; / The circus splashed andseethed and shrieked / All round Faustine.”Faustine is the goddess Fortuna gambling with dead men’s bones. She rules fluxand change because she is an early version of Swinburne’s ocean mother. Like allhis Decadent centerfolds, she is not nymph but dowager, a Belle Dame Sans Merciof ripe midlife heft. Her brow weighs like a thundercloud, bulging withomniscience. Venom runs in her veins. Under her régime, love and death aregaping hungry mouths. Faustine is nature’s womb and tomb, the playground of sexwar. “Nets caught the pike, pikes tore the net”: mothers, sons, and lovers clashlike gladiators, their mismatched genitals the tools of shredding and capture.Faustine is Swinburne’s Masque of the Red Death: man’s life drains with everybreath, leaking from every pore. The earth is a sand pit of carnage, drinking uphuman blood to fertilize the insatiable all-mother. Like Dolores, Faustine isanother Nero, a jaded Fate turning thumbs down on man for her own amusement.Death in the afternoon as the Queen Mother’s high tea.The name Faustine, closing each stanza, is repeated forty-one times, a malignantrefrain. Swinburne’s speaker is a Late Romantic imprisoned consciousness. Thepoem shows thought perpetually circling back to one sexual focal point. Eachstanza is a paradigm of decadence, a decline or “falling away,” for the linesrise up only to fall back with fatigue, like Sisyphus in his no-win labors.Language is a burden taken up and dropped again and again. All things returnmechanically, compulsively to one female center, primary and corrupt. Faustineis a mass of female matter blocking the movement of mind, so that each stanza isan irrevocable nostos, a forced-march coming home. Carroll’s Alice repeatedlytries to strike out through the garden, only to have the path seem to shakeitself and fling her back toward the house. In Faustine a monstrous apparitionawaits us at the door. Mario Praz says of Swinburne’s women, “They have a gooddeal of the idol about them—in fact of the εImage [../images/i-02.gif]δωλον, thephantom of the mind rather than of the real human being.”3[ch25_notes.html#ch18note3a] In Faustine, mind too is a phantom, subdued andvaporized by the brute obduracy of the mother-stuff, the muddy morass from whichall life has sprung.Faustine is the most incantatory of Swinburne’s poems and therefore the mostovertly ritualistic. The lines are short and the meter harsh and relentless.Faustine provides a stylistic rationale for Swinburne’s notorious andoft-derided alliterations. The most famous is from Dolores: “The lilies andlanguors of virtue / For the raptures and roses of vice.” Swinburne’salliterations dramatize his repetition-compulsion, by which he constructs a vastworld of female force. In Faustine, a terrible and uncanny poem, poetry returnsto its origins in religious ritual. Few things in literature provide so intensea replication of primitive experience. Modern readers, eye-ing Faustine’ssomewhat sleazy locutions, may doubt this—until we try to read the poem aloud.The forty-one thudding returns of Faustine are literally unbearable. Even Poe’sLigeia returns only once!Swinburne’s vampires inherit the promiscuous lesbianism of Baudelaire’s JeanneDuval, all the more atrocious for an English audience unprepared for suchaberrations by a Balzac or Gautier. The women’s plural sexuality comes fromtheir multiple identities, flooding history. Dolores has lesbian adventures inGreek shadows of sexual ambiguity. “Stray breaths of Sapphic song” blow throughFaustine, shaking her “fierce quivering blood.” She seeks “sterile growths ofsexless root or epicene,” “kisses without fruit of love.” She is “a thing thathinges hold, / A love-machine / With clockwork joints of supple gold.”Ambisexual Faustine is drawn to lesbianism for its Baudelairean sterility, bywhich nature is self-devastated. Swinburne transforms Sapphism into theinorganic, a necrophiliac compost heap. Faustine as love-machine is anotherandrogyne as nineteenth-century manufactured object, like Shelley’sHermaphrodite. Faustine’s tyrannically mechanical meter is therefore form’sresponse to content. The poem itself is an automaton driven by a robotlikefemale despot. Faustine is Faust, Mephistopheles, and Homunculus all in one, abarren bone mill whirring with daemonic internal transactions.Dolores and Faustine are titanic projections of female hierarchic authority.Swinburne’s few transient males merely illustrate a sensual embowered passivity.A typical sex-reversal from Dolores: “O lips full of lust and of laughter, /Curled snakes that are fed from my breast, / Bite hard, lest remembrance comeafter / And press with new lips where you pressed.” In a grisly Manneristmetaphor, Dolores’ cruelly laughing lips are curled snakes, disconnected fromher face by Decadent fission. The snake-lips are attacking a male breast.Swinburne is the doomed Cleopatra (subject of another poem) giving suck to herasps, phallically generated by potent Dolores. The passage may be a perversedaemonization of Keats’s remark about the heart as “the teat from which the Mindor intelligence sucks its identity.” Swinburne becomes the Teiresias androgyne,a nurturant male. He assumes the Great Mother’s parturient powers where she hasabandoned them. But his nursling is a vampire, draining blood rather than milk.Male breasts are eternally dry, an archetypal curse. Man is no Muse. Swinburneemulates Kleist’s Achilles, whose breasts are gnawed by the Amazon and her dogs.The victim invites Dolores’ abuse in order to sink into oblivion. Sexual pain isa ritual to drive off the mental. Conscience is merely an aspiring leech.Swinburne evades both Christian guilt and Romantic self-consciousness by ahistorical detour, surrender to the primeval dominatrix.In Laus Veneris (“Praise of Venus”), Swinburne’s version of the Tannhäuserlegend, the sexual world is female terrain where man lies chained. Tannhäuser isimprisoned in Venus’ bower, both the garden of mother nature and the genitalwomb-world of every female. Men are many and dispensable: “Their blood runsround the roots of time like rain: / She casts them forth and gathers themagain; / With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies / Exceeding pleasure outof extreme pain.” The hero finds wound round his neck “the hands that stifle andthe hair that stings.” Medusan Venus has hissing serpent-hair. She sheds herlovers’ blood to irrigate the seasons. Like Cadmus sowing dragon’s teeth, sheplants her victims’ corpses and harvests fresh crops of men. Like the Fates orHomeric sorceresses, she weaves at a mysterious loom, the pregnant female body.Binding Adonis by a “chain” of “flesh and blood,” she divides him “vein byvein.” Spenser’s boyish demigod becomes Blake’s prisoner humanity of The MentalTraveller, dissected by the maternal sadist condemning him to sexual life.Swinburne’s frequent word “divide” suggests life is torn by warring contraries,united only by death. “Daemonic,” Bloom notes, descends from the Greek *daiein,meaning to divide or distribute.4 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note4a] Thus Swinburne’sworld of daemonic female power is predicated on male division, a black marriageof heaven and hell.Stanza after stanza, Laus Veneris depicts humiliating sexual compulsion. Themale, in moral darkness, moves outward with infant “blind lips” (eroticizingMilton’s “blind mouths”) into a sexual trap. Like Poe’s sailor in A Descent intothe Maelström, he is reabsorbed into a churning female matrix. Swinburnestudiously gathers for his poetry all the iconography of classic femmes fatales.He arms his vicious personae with every biological weapon. Venus is a sexualaggressor: “Yea, she laid hold upon me, and her mouth / Clove unto mine as soulto body doth.” The succubus is demiurge, mother, bride, and Muse. The hero says,“I dare not always touch her, lest the kiss / Leave my lips charred.” The poetmaking poetry is the maiden Semele in a trance of Blakean love-fear, while Venusis a golden idol burning with supernatural fire. The profane is sacred.Swinburne’s reputation was made by the verse-play Atalanta in Calydon. A yearbefore Poems and Ballads, it displays his signature cast of sexual personae, allandrogynes. There is Atalanta, the Amazon runner; Althaea, a vengeful omnipotentmother; and her son, Meleager, in whom action melts into erotic passivity.Meleager is scissored between lines of female force. Atalanta in Calydon has acruciform pattern, with man the scapegoat. Will is in decline. The Greek herocan no longer defeat the Sphinx.Atalanta in Calydon cascades with magnificent archetypal imagery. Love is stormand strife. Season devours season. Earth turns to ocean. There is littlecharacterization: everyone speaks the same Swinburnian language. Character isforged through opposition, the clash of sexual personae. The play is Decadentfamily romance. Atalanta in Calydon combines chthonian intuition with Greekvisionary aestheticism. The play is more authentically Greek in phrase andfeeling than the Fitzgerald translations of Homer now enshrined as standardtexts in American universities. Swinburne uses the Meleager legend to reviseAeschylus: Atalanta in Calydon is the Oresteia recast in Late Romantic terms,with Apollo replaced by his twin sister. In his study of Greek cults, Farnellsays, “Atalanta is Artemis under another name.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note5a]Althaea combines Clytemnestra and Furies. Now Orestes loses: the tormented son,Meleager, is destroyed by an impossible choice between mother and lover. Womansmothers all options. Fatherhood does not exist. In Swinburne’s Oresteia,Apollonian and chthonian war, but neither gains the upper hand. ApollonianAtalanta’s first words are “Sun, and clear light among green hills.” Sky-cultand earth-cult joust for power, with man as the prize. But after the game, thegods simply go back to their pleasures.Atalanta was celebrated for her swiftness or masculine mobility. Swinburne’sversion of her legend is inspired by Ovid but influenced by Spenser. “ArcadianAtalanta, snowy-souled,” is frosty with Apollonian chastity. Artemis’ favorite,she rejects spouse and children and haughtily affirms her own “forest holiness,/ Fame, and this armed and iron maidenhood.” Atalanta is Spenser’s huntressBelphoebe, who flees all touch. Meleager, fascinated by Atalanta’s androgyny,calls her “Most fair and fearful, feminine, a god, / Faultless.” The chorus seesAtalanta as “a maiden clean, / Pure iron, fashioned for a sword; and man / Sheloves not.” Atalanta invades the male horde and makes division. At the hunt,Meleager’s uncle insults him: “Why, if she ride among us for a man, / Sit thoufor her and spin.” Anatomy and destiny change hands: woman will rove, while mansits bound by self-spun cords. Meleager becomes Spenser’s transvestite Artegall,doing woman’s work in the Amazon household. Woman’s advance means man’sregression.Meleager’s mother denounces Atalanta in social terms: “A woman armed makes warupon herself, / Unwomanlike, and treads down use and wont.” But this iscamouflage in sex war. Althaea’s resentments are deeper. For her, motherhood ispossession, and possession is ten-tenths of the law. Later, she concedesAtalanta’s sexual uncanniness, calling her “She the strange woman, she theflower, the sword, / Red from spilt blood, a mortal flower to men, / Adorable,detestable.” These vivid images are partly self-projections from Althaea’s ownchthonian nature. Atalanta is flower and sword, the angel blocking the way tothe garden. The genital duality of flower/sword recalls transvestite Rosalind,who is both rose and prick. Althaea reshapes Atalanta in her own image, acarnivorous flower like Huysmans’ bloody vaginal blooms.Thus Atalanta in Calydon subordinates its hero to Apollonian and chthonianandrogynes, cornering him in a sexual cul-de-sac. Neither earth-cult norsky-cult spares the supplicant. In Greek legend, Meleager’s mother guards hislife term, magically residing in a brand plucked from the fire. Swinburne makesthe brand man’s helpless sexual nature, burning but numbed. Hercules’ phallicclub is a toy in woman’s hands. The Fates gave Althaea control over the brand:she declares, “The gods are many about me; I am one.” Motherhood and godhead arein league, a cosmic conspiracy. When Althaea bitterly rebukes him for lovingsomeone other than her, Meleager laments the ambivalence of the mother-relation:“For there is nothing terribler to men / Than the sweet face of mothers, and themight.” Love is the mask; power is the reality. The mother is met at every turnof life’s path, multiplied in a hundred hidden forms.When she kills her son by flinging the brand into the fire, Althaea makes anaudacious proclamation of maternal priority:Fate is made mine for ever; he is my son,My bedfellow, my brother. You strong gods,Give place unto me; I am as any of you,To give life and to take life. Thou, old earth,That has made man and unmade; thou whose mouthLooks red from the eaten fruits of thine own womb;Behold me with what lips upon what foodI feed and fill my body; even with fleshMade of my body.The speech vibrates with biblical and classical allusions. The mother gathersinto herself the whole of cultural history. Like Clytemnestra, slaughteringAgamemnon for sacrificing their daughter, Althaea insists all legal and moralrights must yield to maternity. In Swinburne, husband and child are one, markedfor death. Romantic incest collapses human relationships into primeval unity.Family romance is destiny. Althaea claims, as a mother, that she is greater thanthe gods: we are back in Aeschylus, where the Eumenides opens with the oraclereciting the successive owners of Delphi, from ancient Earth (Ge) to the upstartOlympians. In Swinburne, Earth, with whom Althaea allies herself, returns todrive away Apollo and retake control. Earth is Sadean nature, her mouth red fromfeasting on her own children—one of the most frightful images innineteenth-century poetry. She is Goya’s parental Titan, mutilating her prey.Althaea impudently fuses Eucharist with Thyestean banquet: she repossesses thebody of her beloved son, whom she cooks and consumes in the cauldron of herwomb. The family of man is a House of Atreus where all communing is a bloodylast supper.The climax of Atalanta in Calydon is a spectacle of Greek lamentation and ritualexhibitionism. Meleager is carried onstage and just lies there, expiring.Perfunctory in the original myth, the scene is amazingly protracted. ThoughSwinburne calls his play a tragedy, Aristotle’s pity and terror are Romanticallyrevised. All affect is so imperiously internalized by the dying hero that theaudience is left high and dry. Atalanta in Calydon ends in a mass pietà—withChrist still talking. As in Wordsworth’s melancholy story poems, Swinburne’ssecret script is the ecstasy of the male heroine, a central Romantic androgyne.Martyred Meleager is at exquisite stage center, rimmed by that erotic ring ofeyes first appearing in Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner. Like Goethe’s Werther,Swinburne daydreams his pathetic death, a displaced sex act or necrophiliacself-wounding. Late Romantic vision stains its own white radiance. In Atalantain Calydon, dramatic and sexual climax coincide, with the male in radicalrecession.I suspect Walt Whitman’s influence on Swinburne here. The finale of Atalanta inCalydon parallels an interlude in Song of Myself where Whitman casts himself asthe male heroine: “I am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken, / Tumblingwalls buried me in their debris.” The victim hears his comrades’ shouts and “thedistant click of their picks and shovels”: “they tenderly lift me forth.” Now helies in the hushed night air: “White and beautiful are the faces around me, theheads are bared of their fire-caps, / The kneeling crowd fades with the light ofthe torches” (33). Body annihilated but senses sharp, the male heroine is thedramatic focus of a public arena, part theater, part church. He is handled byreverent attendants and knelt to by a silent crowd. The gaze of “beautiful” malefaces brings a tingling arousal. The male heroine is a self-made fallen idol ofpagan flaunting.Whitman’s eroticism requires the nearness of those manly firemen, halfgravediggers, half midwives, who canonize the martyr by labors both heroic anddelicate. But Swinburne’s eroticism comes from the symmetrical heraldry offemale androgynes, who pin the male in a fatal double bind. Only grand opera hasdeath scenes as emotionally overextended as the one in Atalanta. Music is theproper analogy, for Swinburne is pushing language beyond the rational. EvenDickens’ Little Nell doesn’t sing her own elegy. Atalanta in Calydon is both acelebration of and protest against the omnipotence of female nature. Meleager’sfarewell to his mother, delivered as he lies glamourously prone, like anodalisque, is a stunning archetypal flight:Thou too, the bitter mother and mother-plagueOf this my weary body—thou too, queen,The source and end, the sower and the scythe,The rain that ripens and the drought that slays,The sand that swallows and the spring that feeds,To make me and unmake me—Althaea is Cybele reclaiming the epiphenomenon of her son. We are no longer inGreece but in the ancient Near East. Swinburne’s gorgeous biblical metaphorsdemonstrate his transformation of Baudelaire. Nature’s operations are ever-near,however much its destructive late phase is stressed. Althaea as vegetative cycledescends from the great body of Spenser-inspired English High Romantic poetry,which France never came close to rivalling.Meleager’s funeral oration ends with an intricate appeal: he asks Atalanta totouch him with her “rose-like” hands, fasten up his eyelids with her mouth,cover his body with her veil and clothing, and finally lie on top of him. Let noman say he was “slain through female fingers in his woof of life.” The fabric oflife is spun and torn by the fingers of female Fates, both phallic and fickle:the sower as sewer. Meleager demands a ceremony of investiture: the bride asbridler. Atalanta’s veil becomes Aeschylus’ net, a shroud to wrap her wooer. Hercovering gesture is transvestite, as when the Amazon spreads her coat onGoethe’s wounded Wilhem Meister. What of Meleager’s bizarre wish that Atalantarecline upon him as he dies? Consummation by suffocation: the road runner assteamroller. As in Poe, physical contact is possible only when one lover is deador dying. In Late Romanticism, the deathbed is the only bed.The intense, sublimated eroticism of Swinburne’s finale is based on hieraticmanipulation of the body induced by male from female—induced but not achieved,since Atalanta rejects the list of requests and rushes offstage, like Spenser’sBelphoebe. Meleager longs for deft, soothing touches, as if he were a patientbeing operated on. The universe of the male heroine is a medical amphitheater inwhich his passive body is the subject of rapt study and visual caresses.Similarly, our soap opera, originally a feminine genre, teems with doctors andhospitals. Female sexual experience is based on physiologic receptivity andexpectancy; hence it gives rise to an eroticism of visual and tactilemanipulation by groups of admiring others. By the end, Meleager the boar-slayerbecomes a quivering membrane of sexual stasis, a jelly adrift in a female sea.Shifting his hero into the female condition, Swinburne finds a language that isa triumph of passive aggression. Poetry flames with astonishing vitality, but itis always the burning brand on the verge of extinction.Swinburne’s favorite metaphor of female dominance is the nature-mother asman-engulfing sea. It was an early obsession, reinforced by Whitman. The ode ofinvocation in The Triumph of Time personifies the sea with incestuous ardor. “Iwill go back to the great sweet mother, / Mother and lover of men, the sea. / Iwill go down to her, I and none other, / Close with her, kiss her and mix herwith me.” The sea “fed with the lives of men” is “subtle and cruel of heart”:“Thou art full of thy dead, and cold as they.” She is “older than earth”: “Fromthe first thou wert; in the end thou art.” Swinburne’s sea is the primevalmatrix, site of distant human origins, where birth and death coincide.Dissolution is rape and purification, an eternal cycle of daemonic redemption.Sexual union is impersonal, obliterating human identity. Begging the sea, “Findme one grave of thy thousand graves,” Swinburne eroticizes death-by-drowning, aLiebestod or English love-death. As in Freud, the death instinct propels ustoward the inert material past. As in Ferenczi, ocean is “that prototype ofeverything maternal,” the womb-world to which we are sexually called back.6[ch25_notes.html#ch18note6a] In Swinburne, men go down to the sea without ships.The ocean stanzas of The Triumph of Time are a chthonian Nicene Creed, a prayerto the mother goddess returning to conquer her younger rivals. She, not Jehovah,is Alpha and Omega. She is the liquid base of physical life. In Swinburne thereis no swerve whatever from physiologic liquidity, because he is the leastambivalent of poets toward female dominance. The sea has shaped thealliterative, reiterative form of his poetry. Ian Fletcher finds a “rhythm oftumescence and detumescence that flows and ebbs” in Swinburne’s major poems.7[ch25_notes.html#ch18note7a] But Swinburne is without phallic aspiration. Weshould speak of edema rather than tumescence, for Swinburne’s engorgement is bywater, not by blood. His latent rhythms are female, lunar pulls and tugs, surgesof exaltation and subsidence rather than peaks of assertion or propulsion.T. S. Eliot says of Swinburne’s verse, “The object has ceased to exist, becausethe meaning is merely the hallucination of meaning, because language, uprooted,has adapted itself to an independent life of atmospheric nourishment.”8[ch25_notes.html#ch18note8a] I cited Swinburne’s lack of aestheticism, uniqueamong Late Romantic artists. The object does not exist in Swinburne’s poetry forthe same reason the objet d’art did not exist in his life: because he isunconflicted toward female liquidity and does not require the objet d’art as aperceptual defense against it. Swinburne’s uprooting of language ischaracteristic of Late Romanticism, particularly as influenced by Gautier.Detached from social and moral systems, the image becomes form without content.Swinburne’s images, separated by daring syntactic distances, are particlesrising and falling in waves, like the seething maggots of Baudelaire’s “ACarcass.” So nature’s force operates on the smallest technical details ofSwinburne’s poetry. This partly accounts for the deranged metric of Faustine.Not only is the name Faustine so repeated that word is reduced to thing, butmind is acted upon as if it too were matter. It is swept into rhythmic pulses,symbolizing the cruelty and coercion of natural cycle.The theme of male subordination to female authority is more consciouslydeveloped in Swinburne than in any other major artist. As with the Marquis deSade, life and work dovetail, for Swinburne was apparently a masochist in itsstrict sense. That is, he liked to be whipped by women and visited brothels forthis purpose. I resist the general perception that sadists and masochists aremaladjusted. Like drag queens, they see through the sexual masks of society.Unlike drag queens, they quest for archaic nature. Swinburne’s masochism had ametaphysical meaning. His recreational whippings were connected to his poeticcosmology, which restores the Great Mother to power. Self-flagellation wasintrinsic to the ancient mother-cults. Flagellation, flogging, thrashing:threshing grain with a flail (from the Latin flagrum or flagellum, “a whip,scourge”). Swinburne’s ritual flagellation mimicked the public operations ofagriculture. Sadomasochism is perverse nature-cult. Surrendering himself towhipping, Swinburne theatrically formalized the hierarchical sexual relations ofa universe activated by female force. Mind and body, pleasure and pain, motherand son were reunited in archaic sexual ceremony.Thus the hierarchy of female over male is the spiritual principle of Swinburne’spoetry. What then shall we say about the all-woman Anactoria?—a poem that wouldprove Swinburne’s indebtedness to Baudelaire even if we did not have hiscelebratory essay on his Decadent precursor. Nominally, Anactoria is anelaboration of Sappho’s two longest surviving poems, the Aphrodite ode and “Heseems to me a god.” But it is actually, as has not to my knowledge beenobserved, a reworking of Baudelaire’s condemned poem, “Delphine and Hippolyte,”whose structure it imitates: a claustrophobic lesbian scene suddenly widens toan enormous wasteland world. Only two people are present, the fierce Sappho andher young lover Anactoria, a name from the Sapphic fragments. In Anactoria,Swinburne claims, he has identified himself with Sappho: “I have striven to castmy spirit into the mould of hers, to express and represent not the poem but thepoet.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note9a] But never trust a Romantic poet talkingabout his own work—particularly when self-identification is involved.Anactoria is a victim of Rousseauist literary studies, which censor in the nameof liberalism: the poem rarely appears in college curricula or Victorianliterary histories. Anactoria is not only Swinburne’s greatest poem but asupreme poem of the century. Its language is grave and ceremonious, its ideascomplex and extensive. Baudelaire’s sexual scenario is philosophically enrichedby Swinburne’s reading of Sade, who gives Sappho the authority of his mordantanalyses of society, nature, and God. Anactoria is the most overwhelming femalemonologue in literature. Swinburne gives Sappho towering emotional andintellectual passion. She combines Cleopatra’s steamy volatility with Madame deClairwil’s late-Enlightenment high I.Q. In Anactoria the female voice hasstupendous hermaphroditic power. We hear Horace’s “mascula Sappho” andBaudelaire’s “la mâle Sapho,” male by force of genius and Promethean will.Hubris, the prestigious male sin, for the first time falls within a woman’sgrasp. And Swinburne’s Sappho, unlike Brontë’s Heathcliff, dominates withoutshifting her gender.Like “Delphine and Hippolyte,” Anactoria has a pagan setting but aJudeo-Christian God. We are accustomed to female deities in Swinburne.Ordinarily, the only male god is an effeminate Jesus, as in “Hymn toProserpine”: “Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown greyfrom thy breath.” This follows, I suspect, from Gautier’s “Christ has wrappedthe world in his shroud.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note10a] But in Anactoria,though Aphrodite is Sappho’s patron, God is intensely masculine, a Shelleyantyrant and oppressor. Swinburne gives him this masculinity so that Sappho can bemore masculine in her defiance and sedition.Anactoria has three parts. The first is a love poem of lesbian sadism. Thesecond is a portrait of God as a sadist and of the universe as a cold mechanismof sadistic force. The third is a manifesto of Sappho’s immortality as a poet,by which she will defeat God’s power. From the first line, “My life is bitterwith thy love,” love is shown as deeply ambivalent. Sappho chides Anactoria fortoying with “lesser loves,” but the issue is not jealousy but sexual philosophy.The sex impulse, driving from nature, unites Eros and Thanatos. Sappho’slove-talk is suffused with death imagery: “I would my love could kill thee.” Shelongs to impose “amorous agonies” and “superflux of pain.” She would press herlips “To the bruised blossom of thy scourged white breast” and taste the blooddripping from the “sweet small wounds.” She would drink Anactoria’s veins likewine and eat her breasts like honey, so that her body is “abolished andconsumed” and “in my flesh thy very flesh entombed.” Alarming sentiments in aboudoir! Love is caged animal energy, and consummation is conspicuousconsumption.Criticism has understandably shrunk from Sappho’s Swinburnian endearments. Lovein Swinburne leads not to emotional union and social bonding, as in Shakespeare,but to renewed distance. Hence the hypnotic lure of death-by-drowning:Swinburne’s sea reduces phenomena to tranquil primeval unity, swallowing upsocial personae in the faceless nature-mother. Love in Anactoria makes painfullypalpable the estranged distance between identities, a gap bridged bycannibalism. Sappho conquers division by inflicting pain and then murdering anddevouring the beloved, literally assimilating her identity, as Byron’s Manfreddoes with his sister. Sappho is a priestess on daemonic mission, herding objectsback to the primeval fold. In Baudelaire, homosexuality is insatiable because ofanatomical misalignment. But to say that Sappho hates because she cannotconventionally consummate her love would be quite wrong, for in Swinburne evenmale and female disdain sexual connection.Sappho’s hostility springs from a second, more esoteric source. Anactoriadeparts from Swinburne’s other poems in its Late Romantic concern witheye-object relations. “All thy beauty sickens me with love”: Sappho protests hersubordination to Anactoria’s beauty. One reason for the male aesthete’seffeminacy is his submission or enslavement to the objet d’art and to thebeautiful person who is the objet d’art. Wilde says, “The work of art is todominate the spectator.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note11a] The Picture of DorianGray is based on this idea. Swinburne’s Sappho, like the lesbian marquise ofBalzac’s The Girl with the Golden Eyes, is a female hierarch who cannot bearsuch subordination and, rather than yield to it, will destroy the love-object.Beauty is an encroachment upon autonomy.A third source of Sappho’s hostility is a sexual principle I found in Spenser,Blake, Sade, and Balzac: pure femininity automatically engenders its voraciousopposite. Anactoria’s lamblike innocence and defenselessness (“Thy shoulderswhiter than a fleece of white, / And flower-sweet fingers, good to bruise orbite”) are lacunae in nature’s fabric, where nature has nodded at her labors.Sadistically assaulting Anactoria, Sappho therefore acts as nature’srepresentative, spreading rapacity throughout the physical world. Blake’s Songsof Innocence taught Swinburne how to show tender proximity giving rise to a lustfor violation. The daemon rushes in where angels seem to tread. Anactoriadevours in imagination what remains untouched in reality. Sappho is animperialist of aggressive orality, an amoral champion of pure poetic voice. Forher, to speak is to eat is to make love. Swinburne makes poetry into the brutewill-to-power, a Sadean rather than Rousseauist art form.Anactoria’s sensuous vulnerability inspires her lover with a virtuosity ofsadomasochistic language. Sappho envisions “pain made perfect” in her victim.She will “Strike pang from pang as note is struck from note, / Catch the sob’smiddle music in thy throat, / Take thy limbs living, and new-mould with these /A lyre of many faultless agonies.” Unlike Sade, Swinburne wants to retain affectin his primal scene of sexual atrocities. Sade exalts the orgasm, whileSwinburne, ideologically more feminine, relishes suffering. Anactoria’s body isan Orphic lyre played by the Lesbian poet, who makes music from her sobs andpoetry from her pain. Swinburne brings art and sex into astonishingsimultaneity. The word “perfect” recurs. Perfection was the goal of the ancientMysteries, with their stages of ritual initiation. For Swinburne, sexualexperience is spiritual striving and religious illumination. Because it is painrather than pleasure, his sex is overtly ascetic. The body is tested to thelimit of endurance and the dominatrix satisfied only by ideas—by contemplativeself-removal from the sex act, which she voyeuristically observes from anOlympus of hierarchic mastery.Since Romanticism, sexuality has been asked to bear a burden for which it isill-equipped. Swinburne’s poetry is one of the most comprehensive modernattempts to turn sex into epistemology. His sense of quest is shown in Dolores,which speaks of sins still to “discover” and of tortures “undreamt of, unheardof, unwritten, unknown.” Surfeited by its Enlightenment adventurism and the HighRomantic magnification of self, mind yields to the flesh, melancholy object ofthe Late Romantic age of discovery. Action and experience shrink to theparameters of the body, fawningly titillated by the sense-experiments ofHuysmans’ Des Esseintes and fixed and defined by agonized sensation inAnactoria. Dolores is like the sexual preceptress of Kundalini yoga, except thatSwinburne’s universe is ruled by negation. Love is terminal surgery, illicitknowledge that kills.The modern era, which I date from the late eighteenth century, detached sex fromsociety, so that sex no longer required institutional validation for meaning.The unhappy result of this liberation is evident in Baudelaire and Swinburne,for whom sex is a tormenting affliction visited upon us by God and nature. Thescorched sexual landscape of Baudelaire’s Venusian Cythera becomes the nightmarecosmos of Anactoria, which shows the God-ordained “mystery of the cruelty ofthings.” In Swinburne’s great flight of Decadent poetry (based on Ulysses’speech on “degree” in Shakespeare), the mind’s eye moves outward from earthensnaky graves to the “flamelike foam of the sea’s closing lips,” to the“wind-blown hair of comets” and “disastrous stars,” the “sorrow of labouringmoons” and “travail of the planets of the night.” Anactoria, Praz says, shows“sadism permeating the whole universe.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note12a] Thisdaemonic nature, lit by “the sterile sun,” is ruled by a sadist God whooppresses his creation, a spectral Blakean tiger with “hidden face and ironfeet.” Anactoria’s poetry is turbulent with Vulcanian clangings. It shows aworld convulsed with death trauma, an infernal plain grey under an ashyfirefall. We see a sunless Burne-Jones landscape blasted by the fiery breath ofGod.Sappho’s perverse imagination both mirrors and resists this cruel enormity. HerLate Romantic fatigue comes partly from physical laws: “I am sick with time,”she declares. Life is infected with death from the start. But Sappho is alsoweary from her contention with God, whom she challenges and insults. Anactoriais a war of hierarchic orders: female power vies with male. The third and finalpart is a meditation of the Romantic self upon itself. It is to Swinburne’shonor that he gives this task to an imperious female artist. “I Sappho,” sheboldly declares, in a thrilling assertion of poetic vocation. Anactoria showsboth the Romantic insistence upon personal identity and the Late Romanticweariness with it, a longing for repose turning into a longing for death.Identity is inflamed in Sappho: it is a ring of fire within which shecontemptuously isolates herself. In her scornful parting shot at Anactoria,Sappho says in effect, “You will die, because you are not a poet” Genius isSappho’s means of evading God’s authority: “Of me the high God hath not all hiswill.” God’s power affects only her body, which is passive toward natural law.Therefore her femaleness is marked for dissolution, while her maleness, investedin her self-created poetic identity, triumphantly escapes into eternal life, ahermaphroditic transfiguration.Sappho’s most implacable assertion of her maleness is at the end, where shespeaks of future generations who will preserve her fame: and they shall praise me, and say“She hath all time as all we have our day,Shall she not live and have her will”—even I?Yea, though thou diest, I say I shall not die.For these shall give me of their souls, shall giveLife, and the days and loves wherewith I live,Shall quicken me with loving, fill with breath,Save me and serve me, strive for me with death.Artistic immortality is the artist’s devouring of the life of reader orspectator. Sappho is another of Swinburne’s vampires, now conquering theconceptual as well as chthonian realms. Her remarks are directed toward us.Swinburne means us to feel a tremor of apprehension as his belligerent femalepersona approaches the fictive borderline and begins to violate the spacebetween poem and reader. The breath with which we read Anactoria is the breathwhich Sappho will snatch from us! That there is a sexual element in this isobvious. Consider Swinburne’s line, “Shall she not live and have her will?” Thisis a memory of the vampire Geraldine, whom Coleridge addresses after her rape ofvirgin Christabel: “O Geraldine! one hour was thine— / Thou’st had thy will!”Here as in Coleridge, it is eerie to find the masculine locution “having one’swill of” in a female context. At the climax of Anactoria, Swinburne’s vampireSappho has her will of posterity, male and female, whom she spiritually andsexually invades, gorging herself on our life-energy in order to defeat God andtime. Swinburne’s Sappho rejoins Balzac’s and Baudelaire’s lesbian vampires totheir ultimate source in Coleridge, who entered French Late Romanticism via hisartistic heirs, Byron and Poe.Returning to the sexual personae of Anactoria, the issue with which we began, wesee it is out of the question that Swinburne has identified himself with Sappho.She is too despotic a hierarch to harbor any important aspect of his rituallyself-abasing character. Shared poetic vocation is irrelevant, for surelySwinburne would cite antiquity’s abundant testimony to prove that Sappho, the“Tenth Muse,” was a much greater poet than he. The etiology of Anactoria mayhave been in Swinburne’s increasing sense of his poetry becoming uncomfortablystrong. Therefore he revives Sappho in propria persona in order to be crushedyet again beneath female superiority, this time in the sanctuary of his art.Anactoria is a device to give lyric poetry, like nature, purely female origins,thus enabling Swinburne to blot out the entire intervening masculine tradition.There is nothing now between Sappho and him. She is his daemonic progenitor.Anactoria is the most sensuously finished and intellectually developed ofSwinburne’s poems. Its oratory is dignified and restrained, with none of theshrillness sometimes marring the poems in a male voice. I say Anactoria’s powercomes from sexual metathesis, that is, from Swinburne’s transsexualtransformation into Anactoria, passive receptor of Sappho’s savage advances.Swinburne achieves a formal poetic perfection through his unconditionalsurrender of gender. When Sappho, like the raging Cleopatra, leaps from onesadistic fancy to the next, the vividness and vigor of language arise from thefact that it is Swinburne’s own body that is being mentally manipulated by thedominatrix. Sappho’s metaphor of Anactoria’s body as “a lyre of many faultlessagonies” is telling. This is the seminal High Romantic topos of the Aeolian lyreor wind-harp, here played by cruel Sappho as nature’s representative. Anactoriais a lyre because she is the Romantic Swinburne in transsexual disguise. WhileShelley invokes a male West Wind to blow through him, Swinburne invokesColeridge’s evil lesbian daemon. This passage is at the heart of Swinburne’spoetry. It is an allegory of his creative process: we see his innermostsoul-action, the pain-music of his poetry being wrung from him through theoccult mediumship or Muse-like control of a female hierarch. Swinburne, amutilated Orpheus marooned on Lesbos, paints as his self-portrait the mostwonderfully perverse Aeolian lyre in Romanticism. For why is the poem calledAnactoria rather then Sappho? Though she is probably present, like Baudelaire’sgirlish Hippolyte, Anactoria is invisible. She never speaks and is never evennamed. She is as mute as Christabel under the vampire’s spell. My principle-ofsexual metathesis solves this problem. Anactoria takes its title fromSwinburne’s own sex-crossing persona. Author, author! The poet stands veiled atcenter stage.Unlike Baudelaire, Swinburne was fascinated by modes of hermaphroditic beautyother than the chthonian. “Fragoletta” is addressed to Henri de Latouche’sbisexual and transvestite heroine. “Sexless” Fragoletta embodies the mystery ofgender. Like Cupid, she is “sightless,” first because her double naturedepersonalizes her and second because it risks cruelty and solipsism. The poem’sinterrogatory form comes from Gautier’s “Contralto.” Swinburne savorsFragoletta’s piquant boyishness: “Thy sweet low bosom, thy close hair, / Thystrait soft flanks and slenderer feet, / Thy virginal strange air.” Thisandrogyne is far from Swinburne’s marmoreal virago Faustine, like Michelangelo’smassy, writhing “Night.” Fragoletta is a perverse adolescent, mute, passive, andsensually blank. She has the languid petulance of an autistic child. Herdebilitation belongs to civilization in its apathetic late phase.“Hermaphroditus,” a companion piece to “Fragoletta,” was written in the Louvre.Like “Contralto,” it meditates on a Hellenistic statue of the “SleepingHermaphrodite”: “Two loves at either blossom of thy breast / Strive until one beunder and one above.” Swinburne injects Gautier’s genial Hermaphrodite withBaudelaire’s sterility. Fragoletta has a “barren bosom”; Hermaphroditus, withits “fruitless” breasts, turns “the fruitful feud of hers and his / To the wastewedlock of a sterile kiss.” Gautier’s poem is still High Romantic in its easy,far-ranging metaphors of heaven and earth. But Swinburne’s Hermaphrodite poemssuffer a Late Romantic introversion or self-stifling. His Hermaphrodite isspiritually impacted, a pod straining with imprisoned abundance. Nature’s phasesof germination and efflorescence have stalled and halted. The Hermaphrodite isdormant, multi-aspected but halfborn. In Swinburne, English epithalamia are theThames run backward.Like Coleridge, Swinburne made prose defenses of his poetry, moral revisionsobscuring his original intentions. Art and rationalization come from differentparts of the mind. A poet without his Muse is as dull as anyone else. Discussing“Hermaphroditus,” Swinburne praises the symbolism of barrenness, nimbly havinghis Decadent cake and eating it too:There is nothing lovelier, as there is nothing more famous, in later Hellenicart, than the statue of Hermaphroditus. No one would compare it with thegreatest works of Greek sculpture. No one would lift Keats on a level withShakespeare. … At Paris, at Florence, at Naples, the delicate divinity of thiswork has always drawn towards it the eyes of artists and poets. [A note quotes aHermaphrodite stanza from Shelley’s Witch of Atlas.]… Perfection once attainedon all sides is a thing thenceforward barren of use or fruit; whereas thedivided beauty of separate woman and man—a thing inferior and imperfect—canserve all turns of life. Ideal beauty, like ideal genius, dwells apart, asthough by compulsion; supremacy is solitude.13 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note13a]“Nothing lovelier” than the statue of Hermaphroditus? Only primitives andsophisticates find beauty in the grotesque. The first and last of history meetin Decadence. Swinburne sees, as Gautier does not, that Hermaphrodite statuesbelong to the late phase of Greek art, a period of excess, confusion, andfrustrated rather than heroic action. Multiple sexual possibilities cancel eachother out, and being lies paralyzed. Like Huysmans and Pater, Swinburnecelebrates a late classicism of too-muchness. Supersaturation of opportunity andexperience ends in self-lacerating asceticism.Swinburne’s critique of heterosexuality is clever and disarming. Heterosexualityis the measure of all things but common as household dust. Representing “idealbeauty” for him as for Gautier, the Hermaphrodite is like arrogantly separatistSappho, withdrawing from society and nature. Barrenness is now a spiritualprivilege. Male and female are “inferior” because they follow reality tooclosely. About to be slain for her illicit sexual duality, Latouche’s heroinecries she is not of the human species. Thus Swinburne’s Hermaphrodite, exiledfrom social dialogue by its static doubleness, broods in self-thwartingestrangement. Love means never having to unpack your bags. The honeymoon is aswollen orb of psyche hanging low over a never-gathered harvest.Swinburne’s androgynes are Romantic shadows of evolutionary nostalgia, of beinglonging for nonbeing. As Victorian personae, they are insolentlyanti-historical. One reaction to highly polarized Victorian sex roles came afterthe fact in Bloomsbury’s polemical androgynism, a revolt of sons and daughtersagainst fathers. But the first reaction was contemporary: Swinburne’s poetry isa sexual heterocosm, an insurrection of language as well as personae. LikeBaudelaire, Swinburne is anti-utopian and anti-progressivist. That is, heasserts the primitive and daemonic character of emotion, sex, and nature. Sadeand Swinburne show that sexual sadomasochism is always subliminally archaizing.Through ritual flagellation Swinburne returned his imagination to the barbarichuman past. Nineteenth-century liberalism, in politics and psychology, waspredicated on the western concept of free will. The future would bring a socialmillennium. Swinburne is a Decadent because of his contrary conviction of andlonging for decline. In his poetry, psyche is pulled back to nature, a sinkingmovement like that of Michelangelo’s swooning, matter-bound athletes.For free will Swinburne substitutes compulsion, one of his greatest themes. EvenSappho, his most self-assertive voice, must constantly defend her freedomagainst overpowering enslavements—to beauty, to nature, to God. The idea ofcriminal compulsion was invented by Poe: the deranged speaker of The Tell-TaleHeart, irrationally driven to murder, bequeaths his experience to Dostoyevsky’sRaskolnikov, who takes up the matricidal ax in a motiveless trance. But it isSwinburne who invents the idea of sexual compulsion, a Decadent enslavement.Karl Stern says all sexual perversion contains “an eschatological dread.”14[ch25_notes.html#ch18note14a] In its ritual repetitions and subordination tofemale hierarchs, Swinburne’s poetry recreates the primitive world where culturehad not yet risen as a defense against nature and where human life was dictatedby brute rhythms of the chthonian. The confident Victorian alliance of societyand heaven, wedded by Christian assumptions of love and charity, cannotwithstand the force of Swinburne’s pagan poems, once the imagination is caughtup in their daemonic metric. For Swinburne remakes man in nature’s image,sending him back to his origins in a world of hostility and fear.Like Swinburne, Walter Pater emerged from the Pre-Raphaelite milieu at Oxford.He spent most of his reclusive life in the university, influencing a generationof students through his writings on art. Pater adopts Gautier’s ideal ofliterary style as Romantic persona. Through style, he shows how to see.Swinburne, I noted, separates and suspends the units of English syntax. Patertakes Swinburne’s suspension to a Decadent extreme. His long sentences have anerrant, eccentric grace. Gautier needs his polemical preface to do what Paterdoes through style alone: to neutralize all social and moral limitations on art.Swinburne is ruled by sexual hierarchies, and his poetry is energized bydaemonic nature. But there is no energy in Pater; his writing is the ultimate inDecadent lassitude and closure. There is no sex or even emotion in him. Nothingexists but the perceiving self. Pater perfects Romantic solipsism. The malepersona projected by his prose is the most passive in western literature.Language too is radically deactivated. Heracleitus, his hero, gives Pater hisvision of life as an ever-changing river. But Pater wants fluidity and flow,Dionysian principles, without passion, participation, or self-surrender. Hewants dreaminess without chthonian night. Pater’s contradictions appear in theattack upon his writing by what he has repressed: daemonic mother nature, whoappears once and once only.Studies in the History of the Renaissance (1873) is the first classic of Englishaestheticism. Pater’s disciple, Oscar Wilde, called it “my golden book” and “thevery flower of decadence.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note15a] Pater’s homage toRenaissance painters refutes Ruskin, for whom medieval Venice is a Virgin andRenaissance Venice a whore. His “Conclusion” caused such a scandal that Paterwithdrew it from the second edition. The “Conclusion” was the first thing I everadmired for style alone. When I stumbled on it as a schoolgirl, it seemed toexpress everything missing from the drowsy Victorian 1950s.“To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, issuccess in life.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note16a] Pater’s hypnotic, seductivesentences are a Romantic spell, drawing the reader into a strange passionlessstate of contemplativeness. They make perception the ultimate creative act. ForPater, not even creation is as creative as perception. The aesthete is notartist but connoisseur. Pater abolishes morality by frustrating the ability toact: this he does by sabotaging the verb and purging it of energy. Pater’s verbsare passive or static. “Is,” his favorite, does nothing. In Marius the Epicurean(1885), Pater speaks of seeing as superior to having or doing and of vision as acondition of being.17 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note17a] Pater’s “is,” therefore, isthe verb of perfect seeing and being. In Gautier’s Decadent catalog, verbs aresuppressed to favor nouns, which gain vividness and substantiveness throughcolor, mass, and form. But in Pater, the noun does not wax as the verb wanes. Westruggle to halt his nouns to inspect them more closely, but they slip by on theeddying stream of his prose. Infinitives and participles, in disorientingpositions, usurp the verb’s active function. Pater diverts and dissipatessyntactic energy into tributaries of clauses, which drain authority from theconventional English marriage of noun and verb. Pater follows the Romanticarchpattern of regression by making Heracleitus’ river run backwards. Hissentences, seeming to take everything in, actually make movements ofself-divestiture and self-cancellation.The “Conclusion” had tremendous impact upon the 1890s, the Mauve Decade. Patersaid of the suppressed “Conclusion,” “I conceived it might possibly mislead someof those young men into whose hands it might fall.” The misleading was intosexual hedonism, specifically homosexuality. Pater complained his pagan hedonismwas misunderstood: he followed ascetic Epicurus, not the sensual Cyrenaics. Butwas immorality the real reason for his self-censoring? Pater urges refinement ofconsciousness, not masculine achievement in a materialistic imperialist culture.There are Buddhist parallels: the Zen master too seeks to be rather than tostrive. But the analogy breaks down when we compare Pater’s writing to theclosest British equivalent to Buddhist mysticism, the Centuries of ThomasTraherne, a seventeenth-century divine whose emotion is simple and buoyant. InPater we find emotional repression and inhibited movement, a subtle torsion orMannerist sinuosity in the sentences, and finally an obscuring of the visiblejust when we eagerly turn toward it.I think Pater’s distress at misreadings of the “Conclusion” came from his horrorof action, sexual or otherwise. He withdrew the chapter to preserve hisspiritual identity, which resided in superpassivity of persona. An act connectsperson to person, or self to world. But for Pater neither the world nor otherpeople can defeat “that thick wall of personality through which no real voicehas ever pierced on its way to us.” Reality is merely a series of “impressionsunstable, flickering, inconsistent.” The mind of each isolated individual keepsas “a solitary prisoner its own dream of a world.”18[ch25_notes.html#ch18note18a] Action is illusion in a realm where, asHeracleitus says in Pater’s epigraph, “all things flow.” Logically, Pater cannotexalt direct, unmediated experience and also insist on the imprisoned self. The“Conclusion” celebrates aesthetic perception in an affectless chain of imagesbeginning with “strange dyes, strange colours” and ending with “the face ofone’s friend.” This face, certainly male and faintly erotic, is merely an objectamong objects. It is a pale fading oval, like the Cheshire Cat. Traherne extendssignificance to the lowly, turning dust and pebbles to gold, but Pater finallydrains significance from everything. The pursuit of beauty leads him into aBower of Bliss that is a life sentence, solitary confinement without parole. Heis like Rachilde’s Raoule, the necrophiliac aesthete in a self-made tomb.Such limitations upon a self thinking itself free of tradition are anotherDecadent enslavement. We feel this enslavement when surrendering ourselves toPater’s prose, whose fluidity moves in an oppressive silent vacuum. His youngcontemporaries found cultural liberation in that prose. Its exquisite languorwas a vapor or miasma clouding the masculine icons of duty and deed. Pater’sprose transsexualizes the male reader by shifting consciousness into an Orientalfloating world. Though the senses are enhanced, the body has vanished. Nothingis left to which gender can be assigned.Like Byron, Pater values “susceptibility,” a feminine receptivity. Consciousnessis totally reflective, like Coleridge’s sea. The self is as passive as abarometer. Though Pater makes it the standard of aesthetic judgment, the selfseems oddly undefined. “What is this song or picture, this engaging personalitypresented in life or in a book, to me? What effect does it really produce onme?” It: person and art work are equivalent and interchangeable, as in ThePicture of Dorian Gray. Pater’s critic needs only “a certain kind oftemperament, the power of being deeply moved by the presence of beautifulobjects.”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note19a] Personal response is everything. Butpersonality is only a temperament, a shimmering watery wraith. Pater’stemperament is another Late Romantic Aeolian lyre, played upon by externalforces. Now art, not nature does the playing. And the lyre is no longer obligedto sing. The Decadent exults in feeling more intensely than others, a talentconveniently inaccessible to proof. He is excused by aristocratic detachmentfrom organizing these feelings into the new symbolic structures of art.Pater’s religion is a cultic code of Decadent connoisseurship. His influencewould fall more heavily on men than women, who have no public role to abandon.Rejecting Ruskin’s evangelical view of the morality of art, Pater argues thatform takes precedence over content. Art can have no content whatever: “All artconstantly aspires towards the condition of music.”20[ch25_notes.html#ch18note20a] Morality is excess baggage on the winged steed.Pater’s prose is musical: his clean, clear, chastened sentences are flutelike.Pater’s impressionism is paralleled by French Impressionism of the 1890s:Debussy, Fauré, Ravel, Chausson, and Roussel have a fin-de-siècle elegance,suavity, and coolness. There is no exertion or, in Paterian terms, no action.Debussy’s experiments with the whole-tone scale were inspired by Javanese musiche heard at the 1889 Paris Exposition. Pater’s Orientalism is in the slidingmeanders and glancing syncopation, a subversion of western measure. Spenglersays: “To the Chinese all the music of the West without distinction ismarch-music. Such is the impression that the rhythmic dynamic of our life makesupon the accentless Tao of the Chinese soul.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note21a]Pater and Debussy lure imagination away from western action toward easterncontemplativeness. Pater’s disciple George Moore also noticed the analogy: “Ifhe had lived to hear L’après-midi d’unfaune, he could not have done else butthink that he was listening to his own prose changed into music.”22[ch25_notes.html#ch18note22a] What is not Oriental in the French Impressionistcomposers is their delicate perversity. Each tone has equal emphasis, leading toa dreamy moral and sexual ambiguity. Twenty years ago, I was surprised at howmany heterosexual men detested Debussy and Ravel, to whom male homosexuals atthe time seemed instinctively drawn. Debussy has an epicene glamour to whichrationalists refuse to yield. A similar division of opinion still surprisinglyaffects Virginia Woolf, whom David Cecil calls “the final exquisite flower ofPater’s doctrine.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note23a] Pater, Debussy, Woolf, andProust launch male consciousness upon an undulating stream, bright andmelancholy.Pater’s fluidity is an apparent anomaly in aestheticism. The aesthete, I said,honors sharply contoured Apollonian objets d’art as a protest against thechthonian liquid realm of female nature. Heracleitus’ free-flowing water is notDionysian liquidity. Dionysus represents opaque liquids that ooze, drip, orswell in organic sacs. This distinction is evident in Woolf, who loves fluidimaginative movement but is nauseated by all physiology. As aesthete and artcritic, Pater manages to make externals not more but less real to his readers.Objects do not really exist in him; they merely appear. In Marius, Pater says wehave “a false impression of permanence or fixity in things, which have reallychanged their nature in the very moment in which we see and touch them.” Wecreate out of our “fluid impressions” an imaginary world of “firmly outlinedobjects,” so that we think “stark and dead what is in reality full of animation,of vigour, of the fire of life.”24 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note24a] Out of context,these remarks sound persuasive. But they occur in a novel whose stylecontradicts them. If Heracleitus’ fluid vision opens the authentic world toPater, where is the animation, vigor, and fire? Marius completely lacks energy.It is overpoweringly effete—beautiful, grave, and austere, but Decadent withenervation. Pater’s contemporaries felt this immediately. Max Beerbohm recallshis student reaction to Pater: “Even then I was angry that he should treatEnglish as a dead language, bored by that sedulous ritual wherewith he laid outevery sentence as in a shroud.”25 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note25a] Moore says thatlanguage in Marius lies in state. So Pater makes English a Decadent corpse tomake love to. Something is amiss between Paterian theory and practice.What are Pater’s mechanics of perception? “Experience seems to bury us under aflood of external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp and importunatereality.” But reflection magically dissolves the Apollonian “cohesive force” ofthings: “Each object is loosed into a group of impressions—colour, odour,texture—in the mind of the observer.”26 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note26a] In hisritualized perceptual relations, Gautier distances the modern world’s excessphenomena by seeing, fixing, and recording an astonishing exactitude of detail.But Pater’s loosed impressions are a Decadent disintegration. He wants to makeobjects transparent and weightless, like serum. His Heracleitean theory ofuniversal mobility is actually a defense against the opacity of things,specifically the chthonian opacity of female nature. Even as he declares objectsaerated or liquefied by perception, their weight is so great that he isimmobilized. Hence the total passivity of his rhetorical persona. This invisibleweight is what vexed Pater’s first readers into metaphors of shroud and funeral.Pater both refines the eye and blurs its focus. An aesthete, I said, is one wholives by the eye, a process of Apollonian objectification begun in Egypt. Pateris trapped in an uncomfortable intermediate state. His Apollonian transformationof nature is incomplete. Taking refuge in Heracleitus does not solve hismetaphysical problem. If all things flow, the self cannot be a prison. Pater’spersona is as static as Baudelaire’s, but Baudelaire correctly and consistentlyprojects petrifaction, not fluidity as the optimal condition of the aesthete’suniverse.In Pater, aesthetic perception is at war with its archenemy, female nature. TheApollonian eye of the male connoisseur is under siege from the baleful Gorgoneye that Coleridge unshutters in his triumphant daemon, the lesbian vampireGeraldine. That Pater’s Heracleitean aestheticism stems from an anxiety aboutnature is proved by his meditation in The Renaissance on Leonardo’s Mona Lisa.By far the most powerful passage in his writing, it is a spectacular vision ofDecadent Dame Nature. Mona Lisa is a “presence” rising beside the waters. Hereyelids are “a little weary.” Her beauty is “the deposit, little cell by cell,of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions.” In her faceappear ancient lust, medieval reverie, and Renaissance sins, “the return of thePagan world.” She is a “vampire,” “older than the rocks among which she sits.”She was Leda, mother of Helen of Troy, and St. Anne, mother of Mary. She has“perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences.”27[ch25_notes.html#ch18note27a]Pater’s Mona Lisa is mother nature as perceptual oppression, blocking theobject-world with her exhausting omnipresence. She squats like a grimacingGorgon over space and time. She is that “permanence or fixity in things” whichPater tries to make our “false impression” of reality. Mona Lisa is everythingPater fears and represses. This notorious patch of purple prose is bothinvocation and exorcism. It is Pater’s ritual confinement of mother nature to astrict temenos within his writings. By compressing and containing her, hedefends his identity as an aesthete, a master of the eye. But even as we gaze ather, she freezes us with her evil animal eye. Like Byron’s transvestite Don Juandragged before the virago, we meet her while we are in sexual declension. We areclothed only in Pater’s effetely passive prose. It is a moment of dreamlikeparalysis, as in Huysmans’ flower nightmare. We are dangerously exposed,sexually vulnerable. Appealing to Heracleitus, Pater wants perception without aframe, in the eastern way. But here he tries to frame Mona Lisa in a moment ofhermaphrodite epiphany. She will not stay still. Within this frame she twistsand turns, snaking through history.Pater’s hymn to Mona Lisa stems from Gautier’s essay on Leonardo. Gautierdetects “a certain fatigue” in Mona Lisa, with her “sinuous, serpentine mouth.”We see her “violet shadows” through “a black gauze”; we hear voices whispering“languorous secrets” and “repressed desires.”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note28a]Pater fuses Gautier’s Mona Lisa with Swinburne’s Dolores and Faustine, criminalvoluptuaries metamorphosing like Baudelaire’s vampire from era to era. Pater’sMona Lisa is a sexual catchall, civilization’s storm-sewer, a prowlingpromiscuous Clodia. She gluttonously appropriates “all modes of thought andlife.” As Bloom says, “She incarnates too much, both for her own good and forours.”29 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note29a] Mona Lisa swells with Decadenttoo-muchness. Only Blake’s cruel nature goddesses are this vast.Unlike Baudelaire and Swinburne, Pater has no erotic interest in his titanicvampire. His sublimated tastes are exclusively male. The only sexual orcrypto-sexual event I find in his writing is the climax of Marius, where thehero, in an ecstasy of sharpened consciousness, sacrifices his life for a malefriend. The scene is surely modelled on the agon of the male heroine inSwinburne’s Atalanta in Calydon. Pater sees “a touch of something sinister” inMona Lisa’s “unfathomable smile.” She smiles because she commands vision,knowledge, and experience. The male can no more avoid her or find a place whereshe is not than he can bring himself into existence. She is the weight andburden of biology.Following Gautier, Pater turns prose into poetry. He challenges Ruskin’smedieval morality by making a corrupt High Renaissance objet d’art culturallyprimary. Yeats endorsed Pater’s lyricism by excerpting the Mona Lisa section andprinting it as the first modern poem in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse (1936).Unfortunately, he broke the sentences into lame free verse, destroying theirdiscreet rhythm. His preface says the passage “dominated a generation.”30[ch25_notes.html#ch18note30a] Yeats, who claimed he grew up “in all thingsPre-Raphaelite,” owed a great deal to Pater.31 [ch25_notes.html#ch18note31a]Adopting the sexual syncretism of Swinburne’s vampires, Pater makes Mona Lisaboth Leda and St. Anne (Mary’s weird double in Leonardo). Pater’s mother daemonthus kicks off both the classical and Christian historical cycles, an idea Yeatsborrows for Leda in “Leda and the Swan” and for Mary in “Two Songs from a Play.”But Yeats makes a crucial sexual revision, inspired by his own anxieties. HisLeda is raped and impregnated by a harshly masculine Zeus. Pater’s Mona Lisaneeds no partner: she gives birth to phenomena by parthenogenesis. So “Leda andthe Swan,” the premiere twentieth-century poem, was itself a ritual of exorcismby which Yeats freed himself from Pater, fin-de-siècle Decadence, and his ownlingering Swinburnian dreams of sexual servitude.As a “presence” rising beside the primeval womb-waters, Mona Lisa is shapelessand genderless, only secondarily taking human form. This apparition is “olderthan the rocks” because she created them. Pater imagines her at the Darwiniandawn of species. Like Baudelaire’s vampires, Mona Lisa inhabits a cold mineralrealm. Her beauty too is mineralized, the cell deposit of her perverse thoughts.She fabricates herself by coral accretion, an incrementation of Decadent parts.Her dreamy autoeroticism is like that of Blake’s impacted “Sick Rose.” The slowgathering of “strange thoughts” and “maladies” of the soul into her face willreappear in Wilde’s corroded picture of ageless Dorian Gray. Like Swinburne’sDolores, Pater’s Mona Lisa is simultaneously primeval and Decadent, Alpha andOmega. She sets the world into motion and also registers the fatigue of its latephase in her sultry eyelids. These eyelids, like the eyebrow of Gautier’sCleopatra, are a supreme example of Decadent partition, the aesthete’sdetachment of the part for clinical inspection.Transmigrating Mona Lisa has been a male merchant of “strange webs” and a male“diver in deep seas,” whose sunset light clings to her. These far-flungvocations are her inquisitional way of demonstrating her divine immanence. LikePrometheus and Jehovah, she too is a workman god. But why a diver? I suspectPater is recalling Gautier’s King Candaules, where the king muses at lengthabout diving into “the green depths” to find his wife, mystic-eyed Nyssia, “aperfect pearl, incomparable in brilliancy and purity.”32[ch25_notes.html#ch18note32a] Is this pearl of great price the daemonic vampireeye that Mona Lisa wears? Or is she, like Swinburne’s bisexual Dolores andFaustine, a lesbian adventuress diving into genital shadows for a slipperyfemale pearl? (Cf. the slang term “muff-diving.”) Mona Lisa works under cover, atravelling jack-of-all-trades. Like the playacting Roman emperors, she is aqueen on plebeian patrol.There are just two sexual personae in Pater: the passive male aesthete and hiscosmic antagonist, mother nature. She is summoned only once in his writingbecause her ultimate threat is more perceptual than sexual to celibate Pater.The passage on Mona Lisa is in Swinburne’s Hollywood style. The star makes apersonal appearance, fearfully in the flesh. She is a cast of thousands playedby one. He-e-ere’s Mona! The longest running show in history. Pater is a crucialfigure in the eye-intense western tradition. Perceptual relations are his wholearena of quest and struggle. He demonstrates the monasticism and religiosity inaestheticism and Decadence, once dismissed as affectation or libertinage. Pateruses Heracleitus to dissolve the too-too solid flesh of his archaic Venus. ByDecadent connoisseurship, he will clarify and purify the murky chthonianism ofnature. High and Late Romantic vampires are not just the mossy paraphernalia ofdiverting ghost stories. Romanticism, in radically expanding identity, alsogenerated stalking predators upon identity. The vampire is usurpation ofidentity by daemonic nature. Swinburne propitiates his vampire, while Paterritually wards her off. By discrimination of the eye, Pater means to reclaimobjects from their oppressive progenitor. But Heracleitus’ river, relieving himof mass, keeps him in flux. Like Keats, Pater writes his name in water. Nameyour poison. Mother nature, mistress of change, wins at all our war games ofland and sea."},{"pageContent":"19APOLLO DAEMONIZEDDecadent ArtIn the last decades of the nineteenth century, Decadent sexual personae crowdliterature and art. An 1893 poem by Albert Samain proclaims “the era of theAndrogyne,” who mushrooms over culture like an antichrist. The sex-repellingDecadent androgyne is Apollonian because of its opposition to nature and itshigh mentalization, a western specialty. It is louring and enervated rather thanradiant. Colette calls this type of androgyne “anxious and veiled,” eternallysad, trailing “its seraphic suffering, its glimmering tears.”1[ch25_notes.html#ch19note1a] Similarly, Jung sees in the feminine head fromOstia of Mithras or Attis “sentimental resignation,” passive self-pity.2[ch25_notes.html#ch19note2a] Androgyny is not, as some feminists imply, thesolution to all human ills. In The Time Machine (1895), H. G. Wells foresees thedangers of collective androgyny. Society has polarized into a worker class, theugly subterranean Morlocks, and a leisure class, the effeminate Eloi, beautiful,weak, and apathetic. The Eloi, or Upper-Worlders, are Apollonianaesthete-parasites exiled from the productive chthonian realm, run by scuzzyutilitarians. Wells’s time-traveller first admires the Eloi’s androgyny but isthen repelled by their Decadent degeneration. The modern androgyne, seeking onlyself-realization, forfeits the Spenserian energy of opposition and conflict.Decadent art suffered the same fate as academic painting of the Salon, sweptaway by the triumph of the avant-garde and modernism. The last twenty years haveseen an international revival of figurative painting. Museums are dusting offthe discards in their cellars. What is now needed is a revision of art historythat would acknowledge how much avant-garde art really was Decadent LateRomantic: much of Whistler and Manet, all of Toulouse-Lautrec, Munch, and Gaudi,and even Seurat’s La Grande Jatte, with its Decadent immobility andclaustrophobia.Decadent art is ritualistic and epiphanic. Its content: Romantic sexualpersonae, the hierarchs, idolators, and victims of daemonic nature. Evendepicting episodes from poetry, Decadent art is never mere illustration. Itdramatizes dominant western image and sexual subordination of the aggressiveeye. Decadent art makes hostile claims on the viewer. Its style is paganspectacle and pagan flaunting. Behind the trashiest Decadent painting arecomplex Romantic assumptions about nature and society overlooked by textbookaccounts of nineteenth-century art. Modernist culture-heroes like Cézanne areoveremphasized. Cézanne’s plainness and “honesty,” homely Protestant values, arein the Rousseauist-Wordsworthian line. Decadent art, like Counter-ReformationBaroque, tells big lies. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, GustaveMoreau, and Aubrey Beardsley must be given higher rank. Despite brief popularityin the 1960s, Beardsley, a major graphic artist, is shockingly absent fromAmerican university curricula and slide collections. Like Sade, he has beencensored by the liberal humanities.The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, founded in 1848, lasted only five years, but itsstyle was absorbed by late nineteenth-century art and design across thecontinent. Inspired by Ruskin, the Pre-Raphaelites sought to recover medievalsimplicity and purity lost in the pagan luxury of High Renaissance art,typified, they oddly felt, by Raphael. Unlike their Decadent descendants, theyprofessed collective social values. The only member of the Brotherhood whom Iidentify as already Decadent is Rossetti, whose Italian blood would out. But inall Pre-Raphaelite painting there is an unsettling tension between form andmoral content.Pre-Raphaelite painting begins with Keatsian ardor for the minutiae of organicnature. But instead of High Romantic energy or dynamic process, we get LateRomantic stasis. Pre-Raphaelite art, like Mannerism, disturbingly avoidspictorial focus. Our eye is not automatically guided to the human figures but isforced to wander over the microscopic detail. Color is unshaded and applied inseparate cells, as in Byzantine mosaic or Gautier’s gorgeous color units.Flowers and blades of grass are brilliantly lapidary, the paint surface sorichly worked that there is only a single step from Pre-Raphaelite naturism toGustave Moreau’s Decadent jewelled artifice. Everything in Pre-Raphaelitepainting is seen too clearly. The eye is invited but coerced. Part triumphs overwhole, exerting an uncomfortable pressure on the viewer. Landscape has anunnatural stillness, making it a Decadent frozen tableau. Sunlit panoramas arelocked in Decadent closure, a Spenserian embowerment. Pre-Raphaelite paintingdeadens even as it celebrates. Persons and things are candied, mummified,miniaturized.The Pre-Raphaelites revived Blake, who had died unknown. Swinburne promotedBlake’s daemonic poetry, and Rossetti promoted his art. In 1847 Rossetti boughtthe notebook where Blake attacks chiaroscuro and praises “the hard and wireyline of rectitude,” that Apollonian contour I traced from Egypt and Greece toBotticelli and Spenser. Ruskin too condemns Renaissance chiaroscuro. SoPre-Raphaelite sharpness of detail is polemically Apollonian. Pre-Raphaelitemummification is Apollonian objectification and fixation, which Rossetti makeshis master principle of sexual personae. Rossetti, unlike the others, hadtrouble painting landscape from nature and sometimes had to recreate itimaginatively from the Decadent ritual solitude of a black-velvet-drapedchamber.As his career progressed or, some said, degenerated, Rossetti’s paintingsobsessively returned to a single subject, a woman of somnambulistic languor(fig. 37 [ch19.html#ch19fig37]). The Rossetti woman rebels against Victorianconvention, her unpinned hair and unstructured medieval gown flowing withlyrical freedom. The heavy head sways on a serpentine neck. Her long thick hairis the Belle Dame Sans Merci’s net of entrapment. Her swollen lips are to becomea universal motif of Decadent art, thanks to Burne-Jones and Beardsley. TheRossetti vampire mouth cannot speak, but it has a life of its own. It is gorgedwith the blood of victims. Like Blake’s sick rose, the Rossetti woman isblanketed in silence and humid, private pleasures.Rossetti ritually commemorated the face of Elizabeth Siddal, a melancholicconsumptive who died of a laudanum overdose shortly after he married her. Sevenyears later, he exhumed her corpse to rescue the sheaf of poems that, in aRomantic fit, he had buried, with her. He constantly drew and painted Siddalbefore and after her death. His friend Ford Madox Brown wrote in a diary, “It islike a monomania with him.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch19note3a] Rossetti’s brothersaid John Everett Millais’ Ophelia (1852) was the most faithful likeness ofSiddal. Guess what: Siddal herself didn’t look in the least like a Rossettipainting! It is as if the artist were in bondage to Poe’s Ligeia, whose imagevanquishes all living women. Like Leonardo, Rossetti was under enchantment bysome archetypal original, probably a Romantic shadow of the mother. WilliamHolman Hunt said of his treatment of later models: “Rossetti’s tendency insketching a face was to convert the features of his sitter to his favouriteideal type, and if he finished on these lines, the drawing was extremelycharming, even if you had to make-believe a good deal to see the likeness, whileif the sitter’s features would not lend themselves to the pre-ordained form, hewent through a stage of reluctant twisting of lines and quantities to make thedrawing satisfactory.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch19note4a] Obsession is psychicclosure, a Decadent deforming of reality. What in Siddal evoked Rossetti’sfanatical devotion? Her frailty seemed feminine to others. Rossetti saw, as hisnamesake Dante did in Beatrice, the hermaphrodite remoteness of the beautifulboy, the cruel perfection of solipsistic beauty. From the brooding girl-boyElizabeth Siddal came the definitive sexual persona of all Decadent art.Image [../images/f0492-01.jpg]37. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, The Lady Lilith, 1868. Adam’s sinister first wife.The flowers, including magic foxglove on the vanity table, normally bloom atdifferent times of year. So this is mythological woman, queen of nature.Italian Catholicism’s vestigial paganism resurfaces in Rossetti through theimpact on him of High Romantic poetry. His painting begins to drift from thePre-Raphaelite Middle Ages toward the pagan past, a Romantic regression. Symonssees the sinister transformation of Rossetti’s women into “idols”: Venus grows“more and more Asiatic”; his dreams are “lunar, spectral, a dark andunintelligible menace.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch19note5a] Moving back toward Cybele,Rossetti daemonizes the medieval veneration of woman and changes EnglishRomanticism from High to Late. He and Swinburne agree about female omnipotence.The sleepy vampires of his late paintings are chillingly oblivious to themasculine, upon which they have already fed. Rossetti gradually fleshes outskinny Elizabeth Siddal with post-Raphaelite Baroque massiness. He compensatesfor Romanticism’s lack of sculpture by giving his female personae a sculpturaldensity, expressing the hidden oppressions in Pre-Raphaelite nature. The mostblatant of his objets de culte is Astarte Syriaca (fig. 38[ch19.html#ch19fig38]). The somber goddess and two vamping angels all have thesame face, a combination of Siddal with Jane Morris, who according tophotographs had a mannish hardness. Chiaroscuro, banished from earlyPre-Raphaelitism, has returned to cloud heart and mind.Rossetti and his disciple Burne-Jones practice allegorical repletion, my termfor Leonardo’s The Virgin and Child with St. Anne. Doubled female faces alwayssignify an incestuous collapsing of identities, a chthonian undertow. In TheBower Meadow, which I think is Rossetti’s version of Botticelli’s imprisonedPrimavera, the same woman appears in uncanny quadruplicate, changing only haircolor and style, like a molting bird (fig. 39 [ch19.html#ch19fig39]). The fourwomen sing and dance with averted faces. Emotionally disconnected, they floatdown crossing planes of vision into distant space. Van den Berg says thenineteenth-century self came apart or “pluralized.”6[ch25_notes.html#ch19note6a] In Astarte Syriaca and The Bower Meadow, psychefragments into female plurals, the masochistic self-haunting of a Romanticsister-spirit. These alienated twins exert their ominous power across a deadspace of Late Romantic materiality. Rossetti repeats the same face thrice inRosa Triplex and La Ghirlandata. Is she Blake’s witchy threefold maiden? In TheBlessed Damozel, one face appears at different ages. Spooked lovers stare attheir doubles in How They Met Themselves. Rossetti dramatizes the too-muchnessof Romantic identity. He names the Spenserian arena of Romantic crisis: natureas a bower meadow, both open and closed, eternal threshing floor of birth anddeath.Image [../images/f0494-01.jpg]38. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Astarte Syriaca, 1877.Burne-Jones inherited Rossetti’s perversities. Martin Harrison and Bill Waterstrace the hermaphroditism in Burne-Jones’ painting to Swinburne and SimeonSolomon: “This ambiguous interpretation of the sexes is not present in any formin the art of Rossetti.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch19note7a] But all of Rossetti’swomen are hermaphrodites. Take Beata Beatrix (1863), where dead ElizabethSiddal, a clairvoyant Beatrice, prays to the divinized idea of herself withclosed eyes. She is like Shelley’s android Hermaphrodite, murmuring and smilingto itself with sealed eyes. As I said of Nefertiti, impersonality or emotionallifelessness in a woman is a masculinizing abstraction. Siddal’s Decadentandrogyny resided in her solipsistic self-embowerment, her eerie aura. Decadenceis about dead ends. The one medievalism Rossetti retains in his late period isDante’s grandiose cultism of dead Beatrice. In the sexual hierarchy of the VitaNuova, Dante subordinates himself to a coolly narcissistic female adolescent,who I’ll bet no one else in Florence thought was anything special. The latentsadomasochism in this becomes overt in Rossetti, of whom Burne-Jones said,“Gabriel was half a woman.” Western artists ritualize sex, because western artritualizes nature.Image [../images/f0495-01.jpg]39. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, The Bower Meadow, 1872.Burne-Jones subtly corrupts Pre-Raphaelite medievalism with Italian Renaissancestyle, specifically Mantegna’s Donatello-derived Apollonian hardness. All hispersonae, male and female, have Elizabeth Siddal’s face. He is invaded andsaturated by Rossetti’s monomania. Burne-Jones’ pensive Sir Galahad (ca. 1857),for example, is obviously Siddal as equestrian knight. Victorious St. George isso feminine one may mistake him for Joan of Arc. In Perseus and the Graiae(1892), the girlish hero is less masculine than the archetypal women he boldlydeceives. The youth of Pygmalion has the same face as the girl of Danaë. The twolovers of Cupid and Psyche are mirror-images. Octave Mirbeau said ofBurne-Jones’ faces: “The rings under the eyes … are unique in the whole historyof art; it is impossible to tell whether they are the result of masturbation,lesbianism, normal love-making or tuberculosis.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch19note8a]These harrowing black eyes come from the sickly Siddal. Cosmetically applied tothe great heroes of western saga, they drain masculine motivation and action attheir source. Burne-Jones’ knights are obsessed insomniacs watching over thedecline of culture.Burne-Jones’ transsexual world is populated by one incestuously self-propagatingbeing. We are in another Late Romantic bower, shadowless under a grey sky. Theritual limitation on his sexual personae is a Decadent closure, denying our eyeright of access to other human types. The Golden Stairs (1880) expandsRossetti’s triplets and quadruplets. We drown in a shower of identical women,eighteen in all, cloning themselves and assaulting the eye. Beauty in excessmakes Decadent dyspepsia. The sadomasochistic tableau of The Wheel of Fortunemultiplies the male. Giant Fortuna turns her torture wheel, chaining a row ofbeautiful young men, male odalisques in Michelangelo’s troubled late style. Eachseems languid twin of the next, limbs stretched in sensual suffering.Burne-Jones’ embowered nature begat Art Nouveau, which flourished from the 1880sto World War I. Then modern machine culture geometrized Art Nouveau’s organicpatterns into Art Deco. So Spenser’s dynasty, extending through High and LateRomanticism, unexpectedly ends in the Chrysler Building and Radio City MusicHall. Burne-Jones’ serpentine line comes from Blake, whose rapacious flamelikeflowers reveal the covert sexual meaning of Art Nouveau’s arabesques. Thecopious histories of Art Nouveau lack psychological insight. Twenty years ago, Iwas struck by Art Nouveau’s popularity among male homosexual aesthetes, for whomneither it nor Beardsley had to be revived, since they had never been forgotten.In every star, style, or art work celebrated by these Alexandrian homosexuals,there is always a secret hermaphroditism. So with Art Nouveau, the most epicenestyle since Mannerism.Art Nouveau, unlike Islamic pattern, is not value-neutral. But then, nothing inart is value-neutral. Style is always a shadowy emanation of assumptions aboutnature and society. Art Nouveau subliminally expresses the Decadent world-view.Rooms or buildings undulate with curvy rhythms, sexual subversions of westernwill, which since Egypt has based its public monuments on the stable, foursquaredirectionals of the male chest. Mainline western architecture has a rationalorganization unshared by Hindu temples, with their mazelike warrens and swarmingsurfaces. Gaudi’s Art Nouveau rooms and caves are archaic with female swellings.Art Nouveau is active but sterile. The leaves and vines slithering up gates,grills, lamps, panes, and bookbindings are a garden of moral darkness, a junglereclaiming the works of men. Like Huysmans’ A Rebours, Art Nouveau shows natureat her stupidest and most unspiritual, a primeval tangle of insinuatingplant-motion. Art Nouveau is growth without fruitfulness. Keatsian plumpnesswithers and contracts. Art Nouveau is a harvest of spines and thorns. It showsthe modern city as a Sodom in black flames. It shows nature as cold biologywrithing in final spasms. Art Nouveau combines the primitive with thesophisticated, a decadent technique invented by Hellenistic art and turned intocruel fun and games by the Roman emperors.Critics disparage Burne-Jones’ painting as too “mannered.” But this is theelegant self-consciousness of Mannerism. Even Whistler’s suave Japaneseinteriors have a Mannerist linearity; his clean, uncluttered line carries ananatomical message. House and body have been in analogy since the birth ofarchitecture. The stout, bosomy Victorian grande dame is an upholstered sofa.The tall, flat-chested Pre-Raphaelite New Woman, typified by bisexual SarahBernhardt, is a bony Mackintosh chair: tea and sympathy on a Scottish torturerack. Mannerist Art Nouveau denies female mass and internality. Its iron spiralsof flash-frozen vegetation nullify nature’s fecund liquidity. Its whiplash, asadomasochistic trope, stings the eye. Art Nouveau combats the chthonian,mimicking in order to petrify it in art. Art Nouveau is a Late RomanticApollonian style, turning nature’s perpetual motion to perceptual stasis.Burne-Jones, the progenitor of Art Nouveau, shows the Medusahead of nature inall its suffocating disorder. The pretty knights of The Briar Wood sprawlcomatose outside Sleeping Beauty’s castle (fig. 40 [ch19.html#ch19fig40]).Scattered armour lies twisted in a bramble thicket of stunning density,Botticelli’s prison-bar pines restored to medieval tapestry. We see the triumphof mother nature over the masculine. In The Doom Fulfilled, Burne-Jones’greatest painting, Perseus is Laocoön in the grip of coiling nature (fig. 41[ch19.html#ch19fig41]). The design recalls the illuminated letters of the Bookof Kells, because Romanticism is the sacred text of nature-cult. Perseus isthrust into the hungry maw of a Blakean flower. The picture proves that ArtNouveau’s running vines are an abstract version of daemonic nature, come toaggressive life to trap and strangle the human. Burne-Jones’ brassy serpent is ascroll of Art Nouveau ironwork. The organic is invincibly metallic, whilePerseus wears a visionary armour of leafy vegetation. A Greek hero becomesSpenser’s weedy knight Artegall, who keeps relapsing into nature. So we must askof Burne-Jones’ picture: has the touch of the chthonian serpent contaminatedPerseus? Is nature one instant from turning the male back into herself? Legendsays Perseus wins. But the painting depicts the archetypal moment of doubt inwhich we are all caught in our daily battle with nature.Image [../images/f0498-01.jpg]40. Sir Edward Burne-Jones, The Briar Wood, 1870–90.Other Pre-Raphaelites were less interested in problems of sex and nature. HolmanHunt illustrates a necrophiliac Keats poem in Isabella and the Pot of Basil(1867), where a mourning maiden waters her lover’s severed head with her tears.William Morris adapts Elizabeth Siddal’s face, swollen lips, and flowing hairfor The Archangel Gabriel (1862). Simeon Solomon recasts her for Until the DayBreaks (1869), whose ivory-fleshed, androgynous brother and sister anticipateJean Cocteau’s homoerotic ephebes. Their dreamy incestuous intimacy is learnedlyreproduced in the entranced sailor twins embracing in Madonna’s superb peep-showvideo, “Open Your Heart” (1986), which confirms many of my ideas about thesymbiosis of art and pornography.Rossetti’s continental ally is Gustave Moreau, born two years earlier. Moreaudoes to Byronic Delacroix what the Pre-Raphaelites do to Keats: he turns warmthand energy into fixation and closure. Moreau’s static, lapidary Orientalismcomes from Flaubert, who got it from Gautier. The jewelled incrustations of hismurky paintings are Paterian deposits of age and weary experience. Thegangrenous surfaces are flecked with soul-particles, Decadent atomizations.Moreau’s substitution of inorganic for organic things illustrates aestheticism’sflight from liquidity. His ornate Byzantine style is like Balzac’s “blackdiamond,” Cousin Bette, an Apollonian crystal clotted with chthonian darkness.The high decorativeness of late-phase art is a relief from social tensions ofrole and gender. Surface is beyond body and beyond sex. Hence Moreau’s primarypersona is logically the androgyne. Huysmans drafted the reluctant painter intothe Decadent tradition in A Rebours, where Des Esseintes praises and purchasestwo of the Salomé pictures that were to produce Wilde’s play and Strauss’sopera.Image [../images/f0499-01.jpg]41. Sir Edward Burne-Jones, The Doom Fulfilled, 1885.Moreau’s supreme theme is the femme fatale—Judith, Delilah, Helen, Cleopatra,Messalina, Theban Sphinx. My favorite Moreau is the draft in brilliant oils ofHelen at the Scaean Gate (fig. 42 [ch19.html#ch19fig42]). The rough, rapid brushstrokes make it prophetically abstract expressionist. Strolling along the highwall of Troy, gigantic Helen seems to dwarf the city. She has a blankmannequin’s face. Her robes are smeared with crimson stains. Far below, theTrojan plain is covered with shapeless red heaps and smoking funeral pyres.Helen promenades like a chic lady of the boulevards, averting her gaze from thewreck of civilization she has caused. Huysmans, who elsewhere speaks of the“spiritual onanism” of Moreau’s women, says of the Helen of the final version:“She stands out against a terrible horizon spattered with phosphorus and stripedwith blood, clothed in a dress incrusted with jewels like a shrine; … the largeeyes are open, fixed, in a cataleptic stare.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch19note9a]Moreau’s Helen is a cruel idol of pagan nature.Image [../images/f0500-01.jpg]42. Gustave Moreau, Helen at the Scaean Gate, ca. 1880.Moreau is fond of males of Burne-Jones androgyny. His Jason has a girl’s soft,white, hairless body and shoulder-length hair as long as Medea’s. Poets likeOrpheus and Hesiod have feminine face and hair and smooth adolescent chest. Mostastonishing of the series is The Poet and Nature (1894), where an androgynousbeautiful boy slumps, stupefied, in a pool of water. Above him stands titanicmother nature, her face in a demented stare. She grips the poet’s head like abowling ball, both killing and inspiring him. She wears only a long, overgrownmantilla of lichens. Leonardo is the weatherman of Moreau’s thundery sky. Thisdreadful allegory takes place in my chthonian swamp, a primeval marsh hung withSpanish moss and streaky, melting undersea vegetation.Moreau uses hermaphrodite symbolism to revise his French precursors. His rigid,virile Jacob fights an insouciant, long-haired angel with jewelled tunic andblazing halo who, like Delacroix’s Sardanapalus, leans his elbow on a rock andstares languidly into space. The visionary and hermaphroditic triumph over themoral and masculine. Does this fancy angel come from Balzac’s Seraphita? In TheSuitors, taut, vengeful Odysseus, drawing his great bow, slaughters the youngupstarts, whose sleek corpses are an androgynous version of Sardanapalus’murdered odalisques. Hovering in the air, in a starburst medallion like aByzantine halo, is Odysseus’ patron Athena. She seems borne upward by the greatserpent of Erechtheus, phallically protruding from her body. Jupiter and Semele(fig. 43 [ch19.html#ch19fig43]) recasts Ingres’ Jupiter and Thetis (1811). Themassive, bearded father god becomes a bedizened Hindu effeminate, cross-eyed insolipsistic ecstasy. Jupiter is a Hellenistic Apollo hallucinating over hislyre. Michelangelo, shaving Christ’s beard for the Second Coming, makes up forit by giving him a thick chest and heroic energy. Moreau’s god, dripping jewelsand pearls, is a longhaired houri. Semele’s horror, as her tiny figure slipsfrom the god’s lap, comes from her recognition of woman’s irrelevance to soperfect a divine hermaphroditism. Suffusing the painting is a morally ambiguousundersea light, like Pater’s “fallen day.”Beautiful boys for their own sake are relatively rare in Decadent art. In JeanDelville’s Orpheus (1893), the poet’s head, trimmed by Maenads, floats on a lyretoward Lesbos. His effeminate face, orgasmically misted by a sanctifyingmoonglow, is based on that of the painter’s wife. His long, voluptuously exposedthroat recalls the alabaster neck of Michelangelo’s Giuliano, one of myhermaphrodite tropes. Note the Romantic reversal of a Renaissance theme: now thehero is not decapitator but decapitated. Decadent art’s main mission is torecord the modes of female power. Its theme is hierarchic assertion, purecharismatic presence. Because of its mute iconicism, painting is more efficientthan literature for this purpose. Decadent art’s daemonic epiphanies are aresponse to the moral overestimation of woman in nineteenth-century culture,produced by Rousseau’s utopian psychology. So woman becomes the enforcer ofviolent, primitive Sadean nature. Most such works are technically not Decadentin composition; that is, they are monadic, ruled by a single subject. Decadentpainting is one of the most obsessively ritualistic styles in the history ofart.Decadent Symbolism flourished on the continent in the 1890s. Franz von Stuck’sSin, a portrait of Eve, smiles ironically at the viewer (fig. 44[ch19.html#ch19fig44]). We return her stare, until we suddenly notice, amid themasses of thick black hair framing her white breasts and belly, an enormous boaconstrictor fixing us with malevolent eyes. Eve is the modern Medusa, wearing aboa like a boa. Von Stuck divines the serpentine menace in Rossetti’s motif oflong female hair. His Sphinx is equally lurid: a fierce, naked woman stretcheslike a panther, belly down on a rug. Her handsome, aggressively intelligent headand opulent torso imitate the alert posture of the male Great Sphinx. Behind heris Leonardo’s barren landscape of rocks and water. In The Kiss of the Sphinx, afull-breasted half-animal woman bends a kneeling male helplessly backward,penetrating his mouth with hers. Von Stuck’s hermaphrodite visions preservewoman’s ravishing physical beauty, denied by the impurity-haunted Huysmans.Fernand Khnopff also continues the Sphinx tradition begun by Baudelaire andMoreau. His Oedipus has a feminine Burne-Jones face and rosebud mouth. Khnopff’swomen are modelled on his sister, in a Romantic incest-relation reminiscent ofKleist’s.Image [../images/f0502-01.jpg]43. Gustave Moreau, Jupiter and Semele, 1869.Image [../images/f0503-01.jpg]44. Franz von Stuck, Sin, 1893.The style of Gustave Klimt, another Decadent Symbolist, is prefigured inKhnopff’s The Offering (1891), with its surreal elongations and displacements ofdepth. Klimt’s dazzling Byzantine surfaces descend from Moreau. He ingeniouslymixes flat mosaic work with fleshy naturalism. In other words, he jams togetherdifferent phases of art history, a Decadent syncretism, learned andclaustrophobic. Klimt shows personae stuck in the object-world, half-born,half-swallowed. Nature and art wrestle for control. His nude Salomé (1909) takesher hard sophisticated face from Von Stuck’s reclining Sphinx. At the bottom,half-hidden, is John the Baptist’s severed head. The male is a setting suneclipsed by the full moon of female fatality. Judith repeats this sexual design.The Jewish heroine of Florentine art is now a cynical demimondaine with a cold,worldly Joan Crawford face. Smiling, she runs her fingers through deadHolofernes’ hair, parodying romantic tenderness. Her white expanse of breast andbelly and taunting directness of gaze come from Von Stuck’s Eve. Klimt’s PallasAthene (1898) is one of the few postclassical works retaining the militantandrogyny of an Amazon goddess. Her great spear at her side, Athena wears amasklike bronze helmet through which her eyes glitter impassively. On her breastis her barbaric soul-image, the archaic Gorgon with out-thrust tongue. Herchain-mail aegis is tumbling gold coins, Zeus’s sex gift to Danaë. Klimt’sdominatrix Athena is the materialistic city-goddess of frothy fin-de-siècleVienna.Whistler was an ostentatious international promoter of aestheticism, baitingRuskin head-on. His The Little White Girl (1863) is Pre-Raphaelite in mood andstyle, a Romantic apparition hovering in a Victorian salon. Ironically, his mostfamous painting is a supposedly minor work, Arrangement in Gray and Black(1872), which popular imagination dubbed Whistler’s Mother. I nominate her asanother Late Romantic vampire, created a year before Pater’s Mona Lisa. There isgood reason for the picture’s staying power: the eternal mother imago.Whistler’s mother is chilly, half-dead, averting her face from her progeny. Sheis a Sphinx sitting in solid squares like stony Pharaoh, entombed in a sparsethrone room of Decadent stasis. She is as mummified by dry Victorian decorum asthe taxidermic mother of Psycho. Enduring popularity of art works always revealsthe secret poetry of archetype. This is Whistler’s Mona Lisa. His bland, wittytitle seeks to objectify the mother and curb her emotional power. But in vain.The daemonic bursts every Apollonian confinement.Edvard Munch is wrongly classed with the coming Expressionists rather than thecontemporary Decadents. His work addresses Late Romantic themes of sexualmenace, as in The Vampire. His nude Madonna recalls Von Stuck’s Eve in itsshameless self-display of serene female power. The male is a timid, starvedfetus shivering at the bottom. Along the borders, a line of sperm race withouthope of entry. I wonder if Madonna was inspired by a speech in Strindberg: “Ibelieve all you women are my enemies. My mother did not want me to come into theworld because my birth would give her pain. She was my enemy. She robbed myembryo of nourishment, so I was born incomplete.”10[ch25_notes.html#ch19note10a] Munch’s fetus oppressed by female magnitudereappears in the agoraphobic paranoid of The Scream (1895). Frozen on the bridgeof history over the abyss of nature, the deranged Pierrot is a hairlesshermaphrodite, mentally and physically stunted. Beardsley also uses the fetus asa sexual persona: he says of one of his drawings, “The little creature handinghats is not an infant but an unstrangled abortion.”11[ch25_notes.html#ch19note11a] A fetus is the ultimate Romantic regression.Shelley gives himself the happy company of an incestuous twin for his prenataldreams, but Munch’s desexed fetus suffers in frigid modern solitude.Beardsley, the supreme Decadent artist, symbolizes the 1890s, the Mauve Decade.Spengler says in another context, “Violet, a red succumbing to blue, is thecolour of women no longer fruitful and of priests living in celibacy.”12[ch25_notes.html#ch19note12a] Celibate, reclusive Beardsley was a monasticpornographer, reducing mother nature’s colors and volumes to unfruitful blackand white. Like Keats, he caught tuberculosis, dying at twenty-five. His worksare amazingly voluminous, rivalling the two Fausts in variety of androgynes:angels, beautiful boys, ephebes, eunuchs, Amazons, viragos, vampires, earthmothers. He creates a vast self-enclosed realm of esoteric sexual personae.Rousseau’s self-reflexiveness reaches a painful extremity in Beardsley’s eroticmentalizations. Like Whitman and Genet, Beardsley vivifies his sexual universeby the masturbatory principle of Khepera, the Egyptian First Mover. Thecompulsive self-population of art usurps nature’s powers.Too much is made of Beardsley’s debt to French rococo. He began as a disciple ofthe Pre-Raphaelites. From Burne-Jones he takes the Spenserian thicket ofembowered nature, which he redramatizes as elegant conjunctions of perversesexual personae. Rococo is vernal, lyrical. Beardsley’s sharp line is harsh andBlakean; he inherits Art Nouveau’s daemonized Apollonianism. Chthonian danger isever-near in him, as it never is in rococo. Elizabeth Siddal’s face appears onboth sexes throughout Beardsley, in homage to Rossetti and Burne-Jones. Shegives her lips to his early bosomy Hermaphroditus; she is Venus on the titlepage of the Swinburnian Venus and Tannhäuser; she becomes three longhairedpageboys in the first Toilette of Salomé. Something odd: Siddal as Venus looksexactly like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. So, like all living myths, one of themost famous women of our time evokes the hermaphrodite. Cecil Beaton confirmsthis, recording Jackie’s “suspicion of a mustache” and her “big boyish hands andfeet.”13 [ch25_notes.html#ch19note13a]Gender in Beardsley is constantly in doubt. Men and women in the Salomé serieshave indistinguishable faces. Homosexual couples fade toward the feminine. TheWoman in the Moon is jowly Oscar Wilde. Gautier’s D’Albert is more feminine thanthe rakish cavalier, Mademoiselle de Maupin. Earl Lavender’s half-clad ladystylishly flips her whip at the bare back of a kneeler whose head is coyly cutby the picture edge, the sex of the passive communicant remaining, as they usedto say in television schedules, to be announced. Brigid Brophy asks ifBeardsley’s women transvestites are “female fops,” “female effeminates,” or“male hoydens, male tomboys, boy butches.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch19note14a]Beardsley’s monstrosities are gnomes, dwarves, embryos, pasty-faced chinlesseunuchs, sycophantic court hermaphrodites of a dead régime. His androgynes aremalignant sports of history and heredity. Like Huysmans’ venereal blossoms, theyare the tainted flora of late phases of culture.Closest to Beardsley himself are his effete courtiers and soliciting ephebicsodomites. A self-portrait shows him as a leering elf flaunting the phallicjavelin of his ink-pen. He is as neutered as extraterrestrial David Bowie.Beardsley said of himself, “Once a eunuch always a eunuch.” He likes phallicizedwomen. Two versions of Swinburne’s flat-chested Atalanta give her an artificialpenis, a hunter’s bow or leaping hound, inspired, I think, by Moreau’sserpent-sexed Athena rampant. Salomé has a war-crown of tusks, thorns, and lunarcrescents. She seems half porcupine, half randy ram butting heads with theBaptist, who shrinks from this hectoring apparition. She is the Venus Barbata,my term for a nagging harridan of the type played by Bette Davis in All AboutEve and Elizabeth Taylor in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?Beardsley’s hermaphrodite homunculi are not always identifiable. One recurrentpersona is a pear-shaped male with bulging hips, buttocks, and thighs. The Abbéof Under the Hill is a haughty, muff-toting dandy in a knock-kneed,pouter-pigeon stance. The male’s female fleshiness may be accentuated by extremecostume, as in Lady Gold’s Escort, with its phalanx of Russian decadents inzoot-suit pantaloons. The only analogue I find is a metaphor by Shakespeare’sThersites: “the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and potato finger” (T.C.V.ii.53–54). Beardsley’s callipygian males resemble the Venus of Willendorf,with her spindly legs and ballooning midriff. It is as if the Great Mother hasfused with her son/lover. The son adopts her silhouette as an act of sympatheticidentification, like Cybele’s castrated priests donning her robes. That thisswelling male anatomy is based on a female original is confirmed by Beardsley’sbookplate: the nude, book-browsing hermaphrodite has a large butt and tinyvestigial udders.Paradoxically, whenever she herself appears, Beardsley’s Great Mother is usuallyrepulsive. Herodias, for example, is a pig-eyed, slitnosed dowager pugnaciouslypushing her bosom before her like the prow of a Roman galley. Her breasts arestraining bladders scored with veins. Dancing Salomé thrusts her shapelessstomach forward, so that we are forced to contemplate what looks like a deformedwithering of the abdomen into the pudendum. Her nipples protrude like diamondstuds. Her veil, twisting up from between her thighs in a phallic spire, spumeswith bubbles of orgasmic fantasy. In John and Salomé, Salomé’s nipples are angryblossoms, her black navel vulval, tendrilous, vaguely insectimorphic. Theempress Messalina is a big-rumped British fishwife storming, fists clenched, upthe stairs. Her peevish breasts lead the charge with spiked nipples. In The FatWoman, a satire on Whistler’s wife, a huge bosom, propped against a café tablelike a sack of wheat, suffocates the viewer with its blank expanse. Wagner’sErda is a weary, dull-witted earth mother encumbered with a smothering blackmantle of hair, flowing heavily into the muddy soil. The Wagnerites isBeardsley’s Medici Chapel: an audience of viragos with broad shoulders and manlybiceps pack a claustrophobic temple of art.Beardsley identifies the mature female with a nauseating superfluity of flesh.Woman is mass, primeval matter. His Byzantine flatness forces the procreativefemale into two dimensions, which she still disorders with her unstableinflations. Beardsley’s precious line is one of the most fluid in art history.This is a Paterian fluidity, streaming across a depthless surface which shuts upfemale internality. Once again aestheticism ingeniously escapes the spongyvolumes of the chthonian liquid realm. In The Black Cape, which illustratesnothing in Wilde’s Salomé except its sexual hierarchy, the female body iscompletely eliminated. This lady with her tumescent beehive wig is a vampirebat, a Queen of the Night in strange timeless costume. Is it Swinburne’stranshistorical Dolores on a night out? Her complicated, close-fitting dress,with its ziggurat of epaulets and flowing “pancake” train, seems quite capableof taking to the air on its own. Its audacity of form is gender-concealing. Aman could wear this dress to equal effect, for it is a kind of body-mask. Thereis a covert transvestism in Beardsley’s striking designs. The goddess of theVenus and Tannhäuser frontispiece lacks breasts. Her elegant strapless gownreveals her shoulders, slightly too wide for a woman. Like Botticelli’s Flora,this may be a youth cross-dressing for a masquerade ball.Transvestism is far more common among men, I noted, because it originates in theprimary relation of mother and son. Before the recent shift in sex roles, it wasa female hierarch in female dress who lingered at the end of the mental tunnelof every child. A Child at Its Mother’s Bed may be the only pathetic thing incoolly cynical Beardsley. Dressed as a clown, the boy with a cloud of Blakeanwhite hair approaches his sleeping mother, who has one of Beardsley’s malformedfemale faces—smudged eyes, double chin, a boxer’s broken nose. This boudoir isthe shrine of a mother goddess, its altar visible in the background: a longmirror flanked by two tall church candles on vanity tables. Is this Beardsley’sversion of the prayerful devotion of Thackeray’s young son to supercilious BeckySharp? Beardsley’s pale child, a portrait of the artist, is small, flat, andweightless. But the mother, with her black carapace of heavy hair, is a node ofsuppurating materiality. Nowhere is it more evident that Beardsley’s flatgraphic style is a purgation of oppressive female volumes.Beardsley’s view of breasts as aggressive arms of war is part of his critique ofthe eternal megalomania of female power. We recall the shield-point nipples ofBaudelaire’s virago or the nipples changed to piercing vampire eyes on Shelley’sfuture wife. Beardsley uses the many-breasted Ephesian Artemis, borrowed fromMoreau, to symbolize the animalism of procreative woman. His ambivalence towardthe mother is obvious in his Swinburnian Madonnas. The seductive Virgin of TheAscension of St. Rose of Lima is no alma mater (fig. 45 [ch19.html#ch19fig45]).Her spiked Spanish Baroque crown makes her bristle like a black cat. Her obscenegesture, propositioning nuzzling St. Rose, comes from Leonardo. The eagerlyconsensual saint is a lesbian Ganymede. The white innocent is swept towardheaven by the Virgin’s great black cape, billowing voraciously in the wind.Beardsley repeats the pattern on terra firma in A Christmas Card: a BlackMadonna, sporting her informal athome spiked crown, dandles a white infant onher lap. The whole picture is nightmarishly black, from the imprisoning forest,in which Botticelli’s pines suffer a population explosion, to the Virgin’sfunereal robe, an ermine-bordered black-velvet tapestry with silver-filigreeflowers. The drowning white child is a frail Persephone in the bowels of hell.Image [../images/f0509-01.jpg]45. Aubrey Beardsley, The Ascension of St. Rose of Lima.Image [../images/f0510-01.jpg]46. Aubrey Beardsley, Portrait of Himself, from The Yellow Book, Volume 3.Now we can interpret Beardsley’s curious self-portrait, from The Yellow Book, ofhimself in bed (fig. 46 [ch19.html#ch19fig46]). I see it as a sophisticatedabstract version of his Madonna pictures. A boy in an invalid’s white turbanpeers over the edge of his coverlet. He is swallowed up in a towering blackcanopy scattered with embroidered roses. The design is surely from Piero dellaFrancesca’s Dream of Constantine, where the emperor sleeps in his field tent, awhite fez on his head. Woman’s only overt appearance in Beardsley’s picture isas a slatternly animal-hoofed caryatid on the bedpost. But the tent housing theboy-artist is the black body of maternal nature, adorned with decapitatedblossoms and bound with tasseled umbilical ropes. This is Beardsley’s descentinto the maelstrom, the womb of archaic night. Man, infantilized, is entombed inmother nature’s bower, the ultimate Decadent closure. Nature gives and naturetakes away, letting her curtain fall upon her tubercular son."},{"pageContent":"20THE BEAUTIFUL BOY AS DESTROYERWilde’s The Picture of Dorian GrayOscar Wilde, a master of mass media, projected himself internationally as theultimate aesthete. He synthesizes a half century of French and English DecadentLate Romanticism and joins it to the great tradition of English comedy. Wildecriticism is cautious and oddly solemn. One reason is that a male academicspecializing in Wilde still risks being judged both queer and frivolous. Thuscritics drift toward apologia, tediously extolling Wilde’s humanity or morality,things utterly nonexistent in his best work. The time is past when it wasnecessary to defend a homosexual genius. As an advocate of aestheticism andDecadence, I feel no need to disguise Wilde’s cruelty and immoralism.Wilde is an Apollonian conceptualizer in the line we have followed from Egyptand Greece through Botticelli and Spenser to Blake, Gautier, and Rossetti. Inhim we see that brilliant fusion of the aggressive western eye with aristocratichierarchism, created by the Old Kingdom Pharaohs. Wilde was not a liberal, ashis modern admirers think. He was a cold Late Romantic elitist, in theBaudelairean manner. Arrogantly turning life into public theater, Wilde becamedrama’s ancient ritual scapegoat. Apollonianism is objectification, a radicalpagan materialism. Wilde uncannily, compulsively literalized or materialized hisown ideas, bringing about his spectacular tragic fall.Wilde’s two supreme works, a novel and a play, are energized by the westerndynamic of competitive sexual personae. The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890–91) isthe fullest study of the Decadent erotic principle: the transformation of personinto objet d’art. Wilde shows the strange symbiosis between a beautiful boy anda painting, that is, between a charismatic androgyne and his portrait. I notedthat the artist’s hierarchic submission to a glamourous personality ischaracteristically western, as illustrated by Dante and Beatrice, Petrarch andLaura, Shelley and Emilia Viviani. In Wilde, as in Baudelaire and Rossetti, therelation is a Decadent ritual of sadomasochistic enslavement. The artist BasilHallward is “dominated” by Dorian Gray. But Dorian himself is to be dominated byhis own entrancing mirror-image, the art work recording Basil’s imaginativesubmission.Dorian Gray opens with a perceptual pyramid, like the public unveiling ofCellini’s Perseus. Basil and Lord Henry Wotton sit looking up at “thefull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty.”1[ch25_notes.html#ch20note1a] This triangulated scene dramatizes the newnineteenth-century authority of art, with its coterie audience. Romanticismfreed art from society and Christianity; photography freed it from realism. Bythe late nineteenth century, the art work was more separate and elevated than ithad ever been. The picture of Dorian Gray stands alone in its hierarchiccommand. It is imperious as a Byzantine icon but divorced from any collectivevalue system. Wilde’s painting, beginning in a position of spiritualpreeminence, actually increases in power as the novel goes on. We see the artwork steadily escaping into independent mastery. What Gautier undertakes as anamusing fantasy in The Mummy’s Foot, with its rude, refractory object-life,becomes Wilde’s nightmare vision of matter avenging itself on imagination.Basil’s painting, like Balzac’s boudoir a masterpiece of civilized artifice,will generate the most savage barbarities. The artist himself will be butcheredat its feet, his body dismembered and dissolved in acid.Wilde systematically charts the painting’s ritual sequestration. Basil refusesto exhibit it. Dorian accepts it as a gift but, as it starts to change, concealsit behind a screen, then a drapery, and finally in a locked attic room. Thepainting becomes holier and holier as it becomes more and more daemonic. Thenovel proceeds by a daemonization of the Apollonian, my principle of Decadentart. The painting is the precious monstrance of a cult of the beautiful boy,modelled on pagan prototypes. Wilde compares Dorian to Adonis, Narcissus, Paris,Antinous. With his “crisp gold hair” and Greek name, Wilde’s hero represents theAryan absolutism of the Dorian invaders, whose blondeness I found in Spenser’sAmazons. He belongs to the Billy Budd category of ephebic androgyne, retainingthe adolescent bloom into adulthood. Dorian is half-feminine, with“finely-curved scarlet lips” and a “delicate bloom and loveliness.” He has a“rose-red youth” and “rose-white boyhood,” like a fairy-tale maiden. Lord Henrytells him, “You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would beunbecoming”—as if Dorian were Scarlett O’Hara forgetting her parasol. Images offlowers support Dorian’s identification with Adonis. The novel opens with “therich odour of roses,” followed by a hypnotic Paterian description of a bloominggarden.2 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note2a] I suspect Monsieur Vénus is a source ofDorian Gray: Wilde introduces his Adonis as Rachilde does hers, as a beautifulyouth shut up in an urban bower of roses.I said of Greek art that the narcissistic beautiful boy is emotionallyundeveloped and self-contained to the point of autism. His senses aresolipsistically sealed. It is the apprehender, the aggressive eye, who bringshim into existence. Dorian Gray is unconscious of his beauty, even while it isbeing painted. Lord Henry, the serpent in the garden, infects him withself-consciousness. Dorian Gray is unique in permitting the beautiful boy todevelop an inner life, which is immediately deflected onto his copy. The novel’smajor premise is Dorian’s repudiation of the Christian inner world for the paganouter world. By a ritual of riddance, he detaches himself from his postclassicalsoul and projects it onto his portrait. The ancient beautiful boy remainedbeautiful by dying young. Dorian is the first beautiful boy with a will of hisown. He rejects his archetypal fate. He envies and usurps the formal permanenceof a work of art. But the beautiful boy, or the girl who is a beautiful boy, isalready a work of art and can remain at this stage of adolescent glamour only atthe price of perversion, decadence, and mummification. The novel’s last linesbring this mummy literally before us: Dorian’s “withered, wrinkled” corpsesprawling under the painting. As a sexual persona, the beautiful boy, by hisblonde transparency, tries to purge the female murkiness of chthonian nature.But in Wilde’s denouement of Decadent closure, Dorian, entombed in a chamber sotightly sealed that his rescuers must break through the windows, is the materialworld shrunken to Spenserian deformity. A hideous heap, he is identified only byhis rings, as if he were charred in a holocaust. As in Poe’s Masque of the RedDeath and Huysmans’ A Rebours, nature surges back into the palace of art. DorianGray begins and ends in a Spenserian bower. And here, as in The Faerie Queene,we see master and slave, vampire and victim: the beautiful witch Acrasia“hanging” over a drowsy youth has become Wilde’s perfect painting hangingvictorious over its dead double.Lord Henry, following Gautier and Pater, asserts the Decadent principle ofperson as objet d’art: “Now and then a complex personality took the place andassumed the office of art; was indeed, in its way, a real work of art, Lifehaving its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, orpainting.” Since art works, as objects, are removed from the realm of choice andact, the person as art work is outside the law. Dorian makes a career of ruiningothers. The beautiful boy’s moral obliviousness is shown by his dreamily castinghis eyes downward, as in the Antinous sculptures and Donatello’s David. Thebeautiful boy’s cruelty appears in the Sibyl Vane episode, where Dorian courtsand brutally spurns a young actress, causing her suicide. Like Alcibiadesturning on Athens, he is merely following the destiny of type. I said thebeautiful boy straying into the social world is a destroyer, serene in hisApollonian indifference to the suffering of others. Wilde later called the“terrible moral” of the ending “an artistic error,” “the only error in thebook.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note3a] This is like Coleridge regretting the tidymoral finale of The Ancient Mariner. In Decadent Late Romantic terms, Dorian hasa perfect right to his cruelty, through the Nietzschean privilege conferred bybeauty. Lord Henry calls beauty “a form of Genius,” one of “the great facts ofthe world, like sunlight”: “It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right ofsovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it.”4[ch25_notes.html#ch20note4a] Beauty, appealing to the pagan eye, is Apollonianhierarchy, Greek divinity.Dorian Gray makes complicated use of the western idea of hierarchies. Beautifulpersons are aristoi, “the best.” They are Dostoyevsky’s “extraordinary men,” whohave the Sadean “right to commit any crime.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note5a] Theugly belong to a lower order of being. Gautier’s D’Albert, we saw, avoids oldpeople, since it is “torture” to see “ugly things or ugly persons.”6[ch25_notes.html#ch20note6a] Wilde said in conversation, “I consider ugliness akind of malady, and illness and suffering always inspire me with revulsion.”7[ch25_notes.html#ch20note7a] In prison, he retreated from this anti-Christianposition. But Wilde became humane only when he was already ruined as an artistand thinker. Decadent aestheticism is a visionary idealism, asserting theprimacy of beauty over all modes of experience. Wilde was one of the lasttheorists before modernism to insist on the inseparability of art and beauty.Modernist art, with its distortions and dissonances, adopted Gautier’s idea ofthe autonomy of art but left his worship of beauty behind. Since World War I,only homosexual aesthetes have carried on the Gautier-Wilde philosophy, applyingit to antiques, opera, and movies. The witty persona Wilde bequeathed to modernhomosexuals contains, like a box of ready-to-assemble furniture, the whole frameof reference of Decadent connoisseurship.Beauty is intemperate in its exclusiveness, leading the devotee into astoundingutterances. For example, Wilde says, “If the poor only had profiles there wouldbe no difficulty in solving the problem of poverty.”8[ch25_notes.html#ch20note8a] This is Wilde’s true Apollonian voice, callous anddefinitive. Does he mean that the squalor of the poor is an emanation of theirlack of physical beauty? Is beauty spiritually transformative? Or would itsimply enable the poor to survive by soliciting or posing for paintings? To basevalue on profiles is a class arrogance bordering on racism. Wilde’s defensewould be, as he says in The Critic as Artist, “Aesthetics are higher thanethics.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note9a] Higher than: the aesthete, a Pateriandiscriminator of things, persons, and moments, is a conceptualizing hierarchist.Another example of Wilde’s amoral aesthetics: in The Decay of Lying, hisspokesman calls Japan “a pure invention” and the Japanese people “simply a modeof style, an exquisite fancy of art.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note10a] As inGautier and Pater, art structures our perception of the world. Wildecontemplates the Japanese from the far distance with his coldly formalist eye.Lord Henry’s wife declares, “You have never been to any of my parties, have you,Mr. Gray? You must come. I can’t afford orchids, but I spare no expense inforeigners. They make one’s rooms look so picturesque.”11[ch25_notes.html#ch20note11a] Aliens as interior décor. In the Sixties, AndyWarhol “rented” members of his decadent underground for display at chicManhattan parties. The poet Gerard Malanga, sexily bare-chested and sportingglossy red-leather pants, was photographed hung like a painting on the wall, astrap round his waist. In a letter from Paris after his release from prison,Wilde describes a theater outing with his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas: “Bosie wasseated next a German who exhaled in strange gusts the most extraordinary odours,some of them racial (it is smell that differentiates races).”12[ch25_notes.html#ch20note12a] I notice that the Wildean-style homosexual stillspeaks of race and class with the same breezy daring. Oppressed groups tend tooppress other subgroups. But lesbians do not talk this way. On the contrary,lesbians, in my experience, are relentlessly populist—possibly a function oftheir repressed maternalism. Male homosexuals have an instinct for hierarchyunparalleled in contemporary culture, outside of Roman Catholicism. Hierarchismexplains their cult of the Hollywood star, in whom so many are dazzlinglylearned.Hierarchy, the secret subject of Dorian Gray, comes from Wilde’s Apollonianvocation as a poet of the visible. He said, “Like Gautier I have always been oneof those pour qui le monde visible existe.”13 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note13a] Ahierarch by virtue of his beauty, Dorian is himself subject to Lord Henry’s“influence.” Henry follows Balzac’s master criminal Vautrin in subduing aglamourous ephebe to his will. He begins the first internalization of abeautiful boy by invading his Apollonian autonomy with words, to whichApollonian androgynes are resistant. Like Wilde himself, Henry cites andmisinterprets Pater, twisting Pater’s monastic contemplativeness toward praxis:“The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. … A newHedonism—that is what our century wants.” Pater snobbishly complained, “I wishthey would not call me a hedonist. It gives such a wrong impression to those whodo not know Greek.” Pater espoused perceptual refinement, not sexual action.Wilde’s ruin was to come from his materialization of his master’s doctrine. Theeffect on Dorian of Lord Henry’s long monologue is immediate: “‘Stop!’ falteredDorian Gray, ‘stop! you bewilder me.’” He calls both “music” and “words”troubling, “terrible.” Since words and music are Dionysian phenomena, Dorianexperiences them as foreign intrusions. Words mar the Apollonian androgyne’sglacial unity with internality. Henry’s flattery makes Dorian mentally part fromhimself for the first time: “The sense of his own beauty came on him like arevelation. He had never felt it before.” This self-division produces hisFaustian compact: he sees his portrait from the new distance enabling him to seehimself. “I would give my soul” for the picture to grow old and he remainyoung.14 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note14a] Dorian gives away what, as an Apollonianbeautiful boy, he never had until a moment ago.Lord Henry’s practice on Dorian is subliminally sexual. Mulling over his eveningwith Dorian, he echoes but revises Pater’s great sentence from the “Conclusion”to The Renaissance:And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as, with startled eyesand lips parted in frightened pleasure, he had sat opposite to him at the club,the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face.Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to everytouch and thrill of the bow…. There was something terribly enthralling in theexercise of influence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul intosome gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s ownintellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion andyouth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluidor a strange perfume; there was a real joy in that…. Yes; he would try to be toDorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who hadfashioned the wonderful portrait. He would seek to dominate him—had already,indeed, half done so.15 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note15a]Pater’s list of beautiful things, ending with “the face of one’s friend,” ishomoerotically intensified. We are no longer in the cloistered university butout on the town, in fashionable London society. Pater’s passive, prayerfulperception becomes hierarchic aggression, mental intercourse. The pale oval ofthe friend’s face reddens with an indecorous sexual flush. In this candlelitmoment of public intimacy, Wilde creates a male boudoir or bower. Lord Henryplays upon Dorian, lips girlishly parted, as if he were a stringed instrument,to which Europe gives hourglass female shapes. Dorian is the last great Romanticwind-harp. Like Anactoria, he is stroked and probed by amoral words. But whileSwinburne’s Sappho speaks for stormy nature, Lord Henry makes a Late Romanticchamber music. Dorian is an acquisition of Decadent connoisseurship, suavelyinspected like a jewel held up to the light. Lord Henry, like the aristocraticseducer of Les Liaisons dangereuses, takes mentalized sex-pleasure indeflowering Dorian’s rosy innocence. In this classic moment of Decadenteroticism, an aesthetic distance, as usual, is preserved between personae, acharged space crossed by the libidinous eye. Henry projects his “temperament”(Pater’s word) into Dorian as if it were “a subtle fluid or a strange perfume”(Pater again). Late Romantic consciousness is the seminal agent, a mobile,insinuating, ghostly vapor. Henry’s mind-control is prefigured by Seraphita’selectromagnetic domination of her admirer in Balzac.Lord Henry experiments with a male vampirism, transplanting his temperament intoDorian, who is possessed by him in both the sexual and daemonic sense. Basil isincreasingly dismayed by Dorian’s adoption of Henry’s cynicism, style, andsophisticated epigrams. The Apollonian androgyne has no voice of its own;therefore, once its impermeability is breached, it begins to speak with thevoice of another. Dorian, like the Delphic oracle, is under the mediumship of ahidden god. In his review of the book, Pater calls the portrait Dorian’s“Döppelgänger.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note16a] I see a second doppelgängerpattern in Henry’s relation with his protégé: Dorian becomes Lord Henry, thebeautiful boy turned Decadent aesthete. The transformation is complete whenWilde attaches the word “languidly” to Dorian, Henry’s emblematic epithet fromhis first appearance.17 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note17a] An act of homosexualgeneration has occurred, a hermaphroditic cloning of sexual personae. Teachingagain as an erotic transaction: we see the candlelit courtship, the sexualinitiation and insemination, and the Decadent fruition. Dominant Lord Henryspawns the remade Dorian from his cold ivory brow.Dorian himself dominates Basil, by the artist’s own admission. Basil recalls theorigin of his subordination, at a crowded London soirée. It resembles the momentof cathexis when Balzac’s Sarrasine falls under the spell of the singingcastrato.I suddenly became conscious that someone was looking at me. I turned halfwayround, and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that Iwas growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I hadcome face to face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that,if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, myvery art itself.Homosexuals, now as then, recognize each other by a mysterious hard meeting ofthe eyes, a trope of western aggression. The source of this passage is inPlato’s Phaedrus. Basil’s paleness and terror are the “shudder,” “awe,” and“fever and perspiration” afflicting the philosopher who encounters a humanembodiment of “true beauty”: “Beholding it, he reverences it as he would agod.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note18a] Homoerotic Platonism is overt in Basil’slater confession:Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinaryinfluence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and power by you. You became tome the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artistslike an exquisite dream. I worshipped you…. I hardly understood it myself. Ionly knew that I had seen perfection face to face.19[ch25_notes.html#ch20note19a]Ordinary sexual desire is not the issue. Greek idealism is a glorification ofthe eye, not a glut of the senses. Apollo lives by day, Dionysus by night. Basilseeks not to sleep with Dorian but to paint his picture. The portrait is notsublimation but conceptual perfection. Painting, an iconic Apollonian mode,preserves Dorian’s hierarchic command and the aesthetic distance symbolizing theLate Romantic’s contemplative submission to the eroticized object. Subordinationto the person as objet d’art explains the androgyny of all aesthetes. Suchsubordination is intolerable, we saw, to Swinburne’s masculine Sappho, whoseadmiration of Anactoria’s beauty escalates into sadism.Basil and Dorian’s first meeting also invokes one of the primary Romanticprinciples, vampirism. In the middle of a party, Basil senses someone looking athim. Dorian’s gaze is palpable, like the one Gautier’s Queen Nyssia tries towash from her body. It has an eerie extrasensory effect on Basil, because it isan expression of sudden hierarchic assertion, casually exercised by an agentstill unconscious of his powers. When their eyes meet, Basil feels Dorian is “sofascinating” as to “absorb” him. At this moment of visual fixation, Dorian, likea vampire, dominates the plane of eye-contact. Basil, mesmerized, actually grows“pale,” like the vampire’s bled victim. But Wilde gives the daemonic anApollonian setting. Basil somehow grasps Dorian’s “personality” without a wordbeing spoken. He only sees Dorian; he does not hear him. There is an unpleasantintensification of ambient sound in the room. Enlightened consciousness flowsinto the visual. Basil’s revelation occurs in a temenos of muteness, into whichnoise can pierce only by becoming more grating. We witness one of Englishliterature’s great Apollonian epiphanies. The Apollonian is a mode of silence:Dorian’s personality, like Belphoebe’s at her glittering entrance into TheFaerie Queene, is conveyed by entirely physical, visual means. This is arepresentational law of pagan sexual personae.Wilde calls Basil’s painting a “portrait of a young man of extraordinarypersonal beauty.” Personal: what other kind of human beauty could there be? Thishomoerotic locution means Dorian has beauty of personality, but not personalityas normally understood. At his first trial, Wilde sparred with hiscross-examiner, who read aloud from Basil’s confession to Dorian:Edward Carson: Do you mean to say that that passage describes the naturalfeeling of one man towards another?Wilde: It would be the influence produced by a beautiful personality.Carson: A beautiful person?Wilde: I said “a beautiful personality.” You can describe it as you like. DorianGray’s was a most remarkable personality.20 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note20a]Carson’s formulation, “a beautiful person,” has a moral inflection that Wilde isquick to correct. His own phrase, “a beautiful personality,” is morallyindifferent. For Wilde, personality is a fact, a given. It is not character,shaped by education or ethics. Personality for him is immanent, belonging to apreordained rank in the great chain of being of authority and glamour. It is avisual construct. I spoke of the externality and theatricality of theGreco-Roman persona, a public projection, metaphorically visual. Wilde, the mostself-dramatizing of English writers, makes this metaphor literal. Joining Greekidealism to Late Romantic connoisseurship, he imagines personality as a radianticon of Apollonian materiality, the godlike summation of the visible world.Personality is central to Wilde’s literary theory, where it is the measure ofboth artist and critic. He says: “It is only by intensifying his own personalitythat the critic can interpret the personality and work of others. … As artsprings from personality, so it is only to personality that it can berevealed.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note21a] The idea comes from Pater. But thereis a great difference between Pater’s “temperament” and Wilde’s “personality”:the first is misty and receptive, the second hard and dominant. The Importanceof Being Earnest is a spectacle of this hardness of Wildean personality. DorianGray makes personality hierarchic in the Greek way, but it also promotes aRomantic view of the mystery of sex and power. Only Coleridge’s Christabelsurpasses Dorian Gray as an analysis of the occult operations of fascination.No word appears more often in Dorian Gray than “fascinating.” It refers to aperson, an experience, a drug, a book (A Rebours, by which Dorian is“poisoned”). The fascination theme belongs to the novel’s romance of hierarchy.An unanswered question of history is how one individual can control masses ofpeople. Freud speaks of the “fascination” of very beautiful, narcissistic women:narcissism has “a great attraction” for others because of that “self-sufficiencyand inaccessibility” shared by children and cats.22[ch25_notes.html#ch20note22a] Narcissistic politicians induce the investment ofmass emotion by a process of fascination.I compared the charisma of Lord Byron and Elvis Presley to that of theopportunistic first Duke of Buckingham. Max Weber sees charisma as “anextraordinary, supernatural, divine power” that must be manifested by a warlordin heroic deeds or by a prophet in miracles.23 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note23a] Iquestion this definition insofar as it makes charisma dependent upon acts orexternal effects. Early Christianity first uses the Greek word charisma (“gift,favor, grace”) for the gift of healing or speaking in tongues. But I viewcharisma as completely pre-Christian. Athena gives charisma to Achilles when shesheds “a golden mist around his head” and makes his body emit “a blaze oflight.” She gives charisma to Odysseus on Phaeacia: he becomes “taller andsturdier”; his hair thickens like “the hyacinth in bloom”; he is “radiant withcomeliness and grace.”24 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note24a] Xenophon says the beautyof a victorious athlete, like “the sudden glow of a light at night,” “compelledeveryone to look at him”: “Beauty is in its essence something regal.”25[ch25_notes.html#ch20note25a] Charisma in classical antiquity meant exactly whatit does in the pagan mass media: glamour, a Scottish word signifying, as KennethBurke points out, a magic “haze in the air” around persons or things.26[ch25_notes.html#ch20note26a] Charisma is the numinous aura around anarcissistic personality. It flows outward from a simplicity or unity of beingand a composure and controlled vitality. There is gracious accommodation, yetcommanding impersonality. Charisma is the radiance produced by the interactionof male and female elements in a gifted personality. The charismatic woman has amasculine force and severity. The charismatic man has an entrancing femalebeauty. Both are hot and cold, glowing with presexual self-love.Wilde gives Dorian Gray pure charisma. Dorian is a natural hierarch whodominates by his “fascinating” beauty, drawing both sexes toward him andparalyzing the moral will. The narcissism of this beautiful boy has disastrousconsequences: suicide, murder, vice. Dorian excites a mesmeric followershipamong his well-born companions, but one directed toward no public aim, not eventyranny. Basil demands:Why is your friendship so fatal to young men? … You have filled them with amadness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them there.Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are smiling now…. Theysay that you corrupt everyone with whom you become intimate, and that it isquite sufficient for you to enter a house, for shame of some kind to followafter.Seduction literally means “leading astray.” Paterian influence has becomeentrancement and compulsion. Dorian daemonizes his followers, deconstructing thesocial order. He is a Late Romantic rather than Renaissance androgyne, bound bythe public good. As a homosexual Alcibiades, Dorian frustrates dynasticcontinuity. He is ostracized by the elder archons, who formally demonstratetheir displeasure by leaving the room of a club whenever Dorian enters it. Hecreates a seditious heterocosm within society, a colony of pagan idolatry. Wildesays of one of Dorian’s ill-fated admirers, “To him, as to many others, DorianGray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life.”27[ch25_notes.html#ch20note27a] Extreme male beauty, like a siren song, lurestoward destruction.Dorian effects these multiple cathexes by pagan magic. In the Londonnetherworld, he is called “Prince Charming,” a cliché we are meant to hear inits oldest occult sense. Hierarch as sorcerer, Dorian has a “strange anddangerous charm.” He enchants not by words but by visible charisma. Mr. Hubbard,the “celebrated frame-maker,” comes instantly at his bidding: “As a rule, henever left his shop. He waited for people to come to him. But he always made anexception in favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian thatcharmed everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.” The young shop assistantreacts similarly: “[He] glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in hisrough, uncomely face. He had never seen anyone so marvellous.” Like the star offilm or popular music, Dorian draws heterosexuals into bisexual responses.Depressed, he wanders into Covent Garden: “A white-smocked carter offered himsome cherries. He thanked him, and wondered why he refused to accept any moneyfor them, and began to eat them listlessly.”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note28a] Theman makes a mute pagan offering to Dorian’s remarkable beauty, stirred by anemotion he could not explain.Dorian is attractive, in the original meaning of the word. He aligns theimagination of others toward himself by inborn magnetic power. Wilde told afable to Richard Le Gallienne, ostensibly about the problem of free will, inwhich a magnet infiltrates the consciousness of a group of talkative steelfilings, who are mysteriously swept toward it. Wilde often speaks of the“attraction” of personality. For example: “Wickedness is a myth invented by goodpeople to account for the curious attractiveness of others.” He means that thegood are ruled by abstract systems, ethical and social, while the not-good areruled by personality alone, their “intensification of personality,” as he putsit elsewhere, generating a seductive glamour.29 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note29a]This is clear in the original script of The Importance of Being Earnest:Miss Prism. I highly disapprove of Mr. Ernest Worthing. He is a thoroughly badyoung man.Cecily. I fear he must be. It is the only explanation I can find of his strangeattractiveness.30 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note30a]Elsewhere Wilde remarks: “All charming people are spoiled. It is the secret oftheir attraction.”31 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note31a] They are spoiled becausetheir altar is heaped with spoils, the gifts of the multitude. Divine charismaseparates the hierarch from communality by a zone of privilege. Lord Henry saysof Dorian: “I never interfere with what charming people do. If a personalityfascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects isabsolutely delightful to me.” The narcissistic personality, like the psychotic,lives by its own laws. As Basil murmurs uneasily, “Dorian’s whims are laws toeverybody, except himself.”32 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note32a]The Picture of Dorian Gray departs from its Greek sources in this perilouspattern of Late Romantic fascination. Submission to the beautiful personalityleads to degradation and death. In Plato’s and Shelley’s hierarchicrelationships, there is no sadomasochistic pleasure in suffering. On thecontrary, the imagination is exalted, perfecting and purifying itself inApollonian contemplation. Remember the speed with which Shelley dumped EmiliaViviani when she no longer served his artistic purposes. In Decadent LateRomanticism, however, eroticism is terminally obsessive. Basil, admitting toDorian, “I worshipped you too much,” is slain before his masterpiece, the symbolof his Decadent enslavement.33 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note33a] Dorian Gray is alsoLate Romantic in having a male rather than female fascinator. Since thebeautiful boy is anti-chthonian and since aestheticism is predicated on a swervefrom nature, the female impinges only weakly on the emotional world of Wilde’snovel. No goddess loves this Adonis. Sibyl Vane is a sentimental, ill-drawncaricature. My principle of psychoiconicism: feminine Sibyl and her mother, likeChristabel’s Sir Leoline, lose their fictive energy to the dominant androgyne.Wilde’s writing, like Pater’s, has but one cruel chthonian woman, Salomé. DorianGray is governed by triumvir. The three male leads tolerate the feminine only asa component of their own hermaphroditism.One frequently encounters the misperception that Dorian Gray was modelled onWilde’s lover, the boyishly handsome Lord Alfred Douglas. But Wilde did not meetDouglas until after The Picture of Dorian Gray was published. Dorian wasconceived a priori. He is the beautiful boy of antiquity given complex modernform. Wilde writes to Douglas of “the soul of the artist who found his ideal inyou, of the lover of beauty to whom you appeared as being flawless andperfect.”34 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note34a] Therefore Wilde’s first encounter withDouglas after the release of Dorian Gray was a Platonic fulfillment, exactlylike Shelley’s with Emilia Viviani, stunning incarnation of the Hermaphrodite ofhis just-completed Witch of Atlas. But Shelley wrote a greater poem afterward,Epipsychidion, for there were no sexual relations between himself and hisself-foretold hermaphrodite deity. Wilde, forgetting the abstinence of Socrateswith Alcibiades, made the fatal error of copulating with his representationalideal. Byron’s crazed Manfred leaps into the same demeaning literalization. InDorian Gray, Wilde correctly portrays the beautiful boy as a destroyer. Douglasdrew Wilde into Late Romantic infatuation and fascination, disordering hismature judgment and ending his career at the height of his fame and artisticpower. Wilde later wrote to him, “The basis of character is will-power, and mywill-power became absolutely subject to yours.”35 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note35a]Douglas childishly goaded Wilde to file an ill-advised lawsuit for libel againsthis father, the Marquess of Queensberry, first of a rapid series of eventsleading to Wilde’s conviction and imprisonment for homosexuality, from which henever recovered. He died prematurely three years later, at forty-six. Wilde wasalready guilty of a sensual materialization of Paterian doctrine in Lord Henry’sswerve from contemplative to active. His affair with Douglas was the gravest ofhis materializations, for which he was forced to undergo in painful, publicreality that apocalypse prophesied for half a century by Late Romanticcatastrophe theory. Wilde’s fall in 1895 ended aestheticism and Decadence.The beautiful boy is never deeply moved by the disasters he brings on hisadmirers, since he is scarcely aware of anything outside himself. Hisruthlessness is an Apollonian apatheia, Stoic emotionlessness. In a long, bitterletter to Douglas from prison, later expurgated and synopsized as De Profundis,Wilde dismisses as preposterous the charge that he was a bad influence on animpressionable youth. He asks: “What was there, as a mere matter of fact, in youthat I could influence? Your brain? It was undeveloped. Your imagination? It wasdead. Your heart? It was not yet born.”36 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note36a] Why, itmight be asked, was Wilde ever drawn to so contemptible a man? The true aestheteis always a lover of narcissistic beauty. Wilde’s list of Douglas’ defects isneither strident nor rhetorical. It is absolutely consistent with the longwestern history of the beautiful boy, who is a thing, an objet d’art. Wilde,seething in prison, has simply switched perspective on the same unchanging fact.After Basil’s confession of adoration, Dorian Gray drifts into thought,wondering “if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of afriend”: “Would there ever be someone who would fill him with a strangeidolatry?” As the oblivious beautiful boy, he can fall in love with noone—except himself. What fills him with “a strange idolatry” is his ownmirror-image. Dorian falls into erotic subordination to Basil’s painting. Seeingit finished, he declares, “I am in love with it.” The autoeroticism is blatant:he later kisses the “painted lips,” like Narcissus “almost enamoured of it.” Asthe painting degenerates, “He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty.”37[ch25_notes.html#ch20note37a] The picture of Dorian Gray is the fetish of aRomantic cult of self-love.Magic pictures are a traditional romance motif. In Poe’s The Oval Portrait, anartist’s paint drains the vitality of his bride, who dies the instant herportrait is completed. But never is there the fanatical intensity of connectionDorian has with his portrait. High Romantic harmony of man and nature has becomeLate Romantic enslavement of man by art work. The picture of Dorian Grayresembles Snow White’s magic mirror, which the witch-queen, like Dorian,constantly consults. Dorian in fact calls the painting “the most magical ofmirrors.” But Snow White’s mirror has a personality quite distinct from that ofits owner, to whom it makes bold and unpleasing remarks. There is a “horriblesympathy” between Dorian and his portrait, “atom calling to atom in secret loveof strange affinity.”38 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note38a] Man and painting are boundby Dorian’s self-divinizing autoeroticism. The phrase “secret love” is fromBlake’s “Sick Rose,” whose hermaphrodite convolutions Dorian enacts: he standswith a mirror before his painting in the locked room, looking from one face tothe other in solitary self-absorption. The three sequestered Dorians recall thetriple females of Blake’s Crystal Cabinet, complacently self-propagating. Thetableau also recalls the dialogue of Byron’s effeminate Sardanapalus with hismirror. Elsewhere, Wilde says, “To love oneself is the beginning of a life-longromance.”39 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note39a] In his secret pagan cult, Dorian isgod, priest, and devotee, worshipping at his own graven image.The iconicism of the art work is far more developed in Wilde than in Poe. Thepicture of Dorian Gray is an idol, heavy with mana. Relieved at its departurefrom his studio, Basil remembers “the intolerable fascination of its presence.”The painting is a sinister vampire-object, invading the consciousness of itshuman servants. Basil’s premonition that Dorian’s personality will vampirically“absorb” him is redramatized in Dorian’s relation to his portrait. The pictureabsorbs Dorian’s mental energy to the point of obsession. He cannot stopthinking about it. It interferes even in his pleasures: at his country house,“he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the doorhad not been tampered with, and that the picture was still there.”40[ch25_notes.html#ch20note40a] The portrait literally captivates Dorian,controlling him by a magnetism mimicking his glamourous magnetism over others.Like a jealous parent or lover, it summons him back from the outside world toits airless cell. And Dorian is never tranquil except when there. Between himand his portrait is a ghostly umbilical link, like the incestuous bond betweenRomantic twins.Late in the novel, Dorian complains, “My own personality has become a burden tome.” He has so intensified his personality in the Wildean manner that he hasanimated his mirror-image. Now his double, drunk with power, tries to usurp theidentity of its human original. The painting feeds on Dorian, until indesperation he murders Basil, a propitiatory blood-sacrifice before an objet deculte, from whose bondage he fights to be free. But the painting will besatisfied with no other victim but Dorian. The finale is one of the uncanniestmoments in literature. Killing Dorian, the painting achieves its ultimatevampirism, triumphantly regaining “all the wonder of [its] exquisite youth andbeauty.”41 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note41a] The painting finds the elixir ofeternal youth by shedding Dorian’s blood.A peculiar mystical act occurs. Dorian stabs the painting but is found with aknife in his heart. One recalls Balzac’s Sarrasine, who attacks a living artwork only to be slain himself; or Balzac’s marquise, who succeeds in her knifeassault upon the sequestered precious object because she is a female androgyneof chthonian force. Or Poe’s William Wilson, who traps his antagonist in a smallroom and skewers him, only to find he has murdered his “mirror” likeness andtherefore his moral self. How does Dorian’s knife end up in his own heart? We donot ordinarily ask naturalistic questions of magical fictions. Dorian’s death issimultaneous with the blow he strikes. But if we were to expand that point oftime into a cinematic sequence—and Wilde’s novel encourages the deformation oftime by imagination—I think we would see the portrait standing like a cruel,laughing god, plucking the knife from its body like an arrow caught inmidflight, and hurling it back into the heart of its impious assailant. ThePicture of Dorian Gray ends in a spectacle of perverse animism.Many admirers have felt Dorian Gray’s punitive finale uncharacteristic of Wildeand an evasion of the decadence of the whole. In a letter to the editordefending the book against scandalized reviewers, Wilde says, “Dorian Gray,having led a life of mere sensation and pleasure, tries to kill conscience, andat that moment kills himself.” His qualification that this moral is “an artisticerror” exempts us from taking him seriously on the question of conscience. Butif he believed what he said, the man who wrote that letter did not understandwhat he had written in Dorian Gray. No great work of Romantic imagination hasanything to do with conscience. Dorian Gray is a web of Romantic fascination, aforce field of Apollonian and daemonic charisma, heir to Christabel in its darkvision of sex and power. We need no moral axioms to interpret it. Dorian commitscertain forbidden acts and is punished for them. But he operates under ritualrather than ethical proscriptions. The Bible, for example, begins the humanstory by granting access to all trees of Eden but one. The mystery of divine lawappears throughout the world in arbitrary rituals of prohibition or avoidance.By his hubristic defiance of time, Dorian wanders into an infrahuman realm wherehe is at the mercy of pitiless daemonic agents. He is devoted to his portrait: Iuse the word as in classical Latin, where “devotus” means bewitched, enchanted,cursed, consecrated, dedicated to divine service, and marked for slaughter.Dorian Gray is about not morality but taboo. The ending shows not the victory ofconscience but the destruction of person by art work. Dorian says: “There issomething fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own.”42[ch25_notes.html#ch20note42a] The painting, like all hierarchs, makes its ownlaws and subordinates reality to its will. Pater speaks of “the fatality whichseems to haunt any signal beauty, whether moral or physical, as if it were initself something illicit and isolating.”43 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note43a] DorianGray is about the amorality of beauty and the fascism of the western objetd’art. It is about the magic of art in the magic of person.Dorian Gray is like the ritual scapegoat of Aztec festival. Frazer says a youngman, chosen for “his personal beauty,” served as the double of the godTezcatlipoca. For a year, the youth was “apparelled in gorgeous attire” and“trained to comport himself like a gentleman of the first quality, to speakcorrectly and elegantly, to play the flute, to smoke cigars and to snuff atflowers with a dandified air.” When he walked through the city, people flockedto see and honor him. At the end of his time, “this bejewelled exquisite” wasbutchered on the temple steps, his breast sliced open and his heart torn out.44[ch25_notes.html#ch20note44a] Dorian Gray, in “the wanton luxury and gorgeoussplendour of his mode of life,” is also a dandy, a connoisseur, a man of leisuresmoking Lord Henry’s cigarettes, a charismatic beauty attracting attention andveneration in the streets.45 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note45a] Like the Aztecscapegoat, he is privileged but doomed, destined for execution at the feet of anidol, his heart pierced by a knife. The painting is his divine double, the godwho allows him to live like a prince but, thirsting for blood, demands hissacrifice.Another anthropological parallel: the picture of Dorian Gray is like Meleager’sbrand in that a man’s life term resides in an enchanted object. I examinedSwinburne’s play on this subject. In Wilde’s version, there is no longer anature-identified female custodian of the precious relic, since the novel’swomen are few and puny. The ancient Meleager legend belongs to a complex ofprimitive beliefs about the soul. Frazer says the savage thinks of life as “aconcrete material thing of a definite bulk, capable of being seen and handled,kept in a box or jar, and liable to be bruised, fractured, or smashed inpieces.” This entity can be removed from a man’s body yet “still continue toanimate him by virtue of a sort of sympathy or action at a distance.” If it isdestroyed, he dies. Totemistic cultures believe in “the possibility ofpermanently depositing the soul in some external object—animal, plant, or whatnot—, … just as people deposit their money with a banker rather than carry it ontheir persons.”46 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note46a] In Dorian Gray, Romanticism’stidal dynamic of regression makes art revert to primitivism. Aestheticismconcretizes the invisible world, allowing Dorian to deposit his soul in anexternal object, which affects him, in Frazer’s words, by “sympathy or action ata distance.” When Dorian tries to destroy it, he dies. In Dorian Gray, amalevolent totem lures a sophisticate into an act of savagery, Basil’s grislymurder. The novel supports my definition of decadence as sophistication withouthumaneness or humanism.Wilde’s assumptions are normally Apollonian. In The Critic as Artist he says:“Form is everything. It is the secret of life…. Start with the worship of form,and there is no secret in art that will not be revealed to you.”47[ch25_notes.html#ch20note47a] Praising Pre-Raphaelite painting, he condemnsImpressionism as “mud and blur.”48 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note48a] He followsBlake in preferring the clarity of the Apollonian incised edge. Even in Monet’sstudies of flickering light, western painting is Apollonian in its stasis,fixity, and sharp outer borders. What is odd about the picture of Dorian Gray isthat it is in Dionysian metamorphosis. The changing painting insults beauty andform: Dorian calls it “the misshapen shadow,” “the hideous painted thing,” “thismonstrous soul-life.” Nature and art war for supremacy in it. Painting isinvaded by a daemonic form-altering power, because Wilde has tried to makenature surrender her authority. He opens The Decay of Lying: “The more we studyArt, the less we care for Nature. What Art really reveals to us is Nature’s lackof design, her curious crudities, her extraordinary monotony, her absolutelyunfinished condition.”49 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note49a] Wilde has gotten thisfrom Baudelaire via Huysmans. But in assigning a superior value to art,Baudelaire never disguises nature’s violent power. And Huysmans’ dreaming herois terrified by primeval nature’s choking abundance. In Wilde, however, naturelacks archetypal force. His few nature descriptions are pretty and minor. InDorian Gray, nature, denied entry, seeps into the portrait-double and corrodesit from inside out: “It was from within, apparently, that the foulness andhorror had come. Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies ofsin were slowly eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery gravewas not so fearful.”50 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note50a] Internality, liquidity,chthonian murk. Apollonian painting is dissolving and putrefying in Dionysianfluidity.The locked attic room, Dorian’s bower of art, recalls the tower where theincestuous doubles meet in Byron and the turret where the maiden poses for herartist-husband in Poe. The room is also a mausoleum, for it is the dustyplayroom of Dorian’s boyhood, preserved like Miss Havisham’s bridal hall inDickens. Hence Dorian’s portrait is like the ka or double of the deceased inEgyptian tombs, heaped with toys and furniture. The horrified discoverersbreaking into the chamber are like archaeologists finding the king’s mummythrown on the floor by grave robbers. Becoming a corpse, Dorian reaches hisultimate objectification. As the novel opens, the painting is still incomplete.Basil finishes it as Dorian begins to change, contaminated by Lord Henry. AfterSibyl’s maltreatment, the painting never stops changing until the end. Dorianhas assumed Basil’s role as his own portraitist, working on the painting bytelekinesis. The painting finally achieves permanent form only with the death ofits model, whose beauty it reclaims for itself. Hence Dorian Gray is likeWoolf’s To the Lighthouse, which I suspect it influenced, in the way that apainting and a novel are coterminous, developing in tandem, with the last brushstrokes applied to the canvas in the last paragraphs.As a self-portraitist, Dorian is a Neronian life-artist, making perverseautobiography out of the sufferings of others. The first maxim of Wilde’spreface to Dorian Gray, imitating Gautier’s polemical preface, is, “The artistis the creator of beautiful things.” But Dorian, who makes life into a work ofart, is a creator of ugly things: his hideous self-portrait and then Basil’scorpse, a “thing” with a “grotesque misshapen shadow,” a “humped back, and longfantastic arms.” In artistic style, Dorian is prophetically Expressionist. Thebrutality of Basil’s murder is in deliberate contrast to Dorian’s exquisiteconnoisseurship. It is as if Dorian is overcome by a paroxysm of daemonic force,erupting into the Apollonian world of perfect form. We saw a similar effect inEuripides’ Medea, where princess and king sink beneath a tarry wave of fire. Themorning after the murder, Dorian must reconstruct his Apollonian persona byPaterian rituals of discrimination. He dresses “with even more than his usualcare, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie andscarf-pin, and changing his rings more than once.” Selecting Gautier’s Enamelsand Cameos, he admires the binding of “citron-green leather, with a design ofgilt trellis-work and dotted pomegranates.”51 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note51a]Returned from his descent to Hades, the barbaric chthonian realm, Dorianrestores himself to normality by focusing on the Apollonian separateness ofobjects in the aesthete’s visible world, numbering them by cognitive palpation.Wilde constantly talks about “Art,” but his actual commentary on the visual artsis sparse and inert. I think that, as a primarily verbal intelligence, he hadlittle feeling for painting. Whistler made some tart remarks about Wilde’strespass into his territory. Wilde’s stage directions to An Ideal Husband arefull of allusions to art, comparing the characters to paintings by Van Dyck,Watteau, Lawrence. There is a chatty superficiality or name-dropping: “Watteauwould have loved to paint them.”52 [ch25_notes.html#ch20note52a] Paintings arebeing seen vaguely and generically. But Wilde’s only novel is a supreme artifactof aestheticism, taking a painting for theme. The most potent art work in allliterature belongs to the age of photography, which allowed painting to shifttoward the strange and irrational. It is to Wilde’s credit that he sensed andexploited this. The objet d’art resumes its archaic religious function. Wilde,without real knowledge of the visual arts, creates a great book about a paintingbecause of his duality of vision: he is Apollonian in his worship of form butRomantic in his instinct for the daemonic. Together, these principles producethe despotic art work of Dorian Gray. Nature and art, in their ritual combat inthe painting, duel to a draw and separate, leaving the marred beautiful boy astheir Late Romantic victim."},{"pageContent":"21THE ENGLISH EPICENEWilde’s The Importance of Being EarnestLord Henry Wotton is the link between Wilde’s two best works. With his “languidvoice” and “pale, fine-pointed fingers,”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note1a] he isfirst of all the Decadent aesthete—Wilde’s own pose in real life. He symbolizesthe aristocracy toward which the middle-class Wilde, like Balzac, aspired. Wildeadmires “the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing”; he declares“cultivated leisure” to be “the aim of man.” His target is partly the century’sbustling work ethic: “Work is the curse of the drinking classes.” But moreimportantly, he continues the Romantic withdrawal from masculine action:“Action! What is action? It dies at the moment of its energy. … It is to donothing that the elect exist. Action is limited and relative.” The elect: paganpredestination. We “become perfect by the rejection of energy.”2[ch25_notes.html#ch21note2a] High Romanticism was able to hold androgyny andenergy together in one synthesis. Late Romanticism, because of its divorce fromnature, makes energy antithetical. Weary Lord Henry, like Wilde, is inconsistentabout sensual indulgence, obviously a form of action. The Decadent aesthete isin the ambiguous position of having to be inactive yet also glutted by worldlyexperience. Sexually, he has acted or will act, but he must never be seen to beacting. It’s like the White Queen’s rule, “Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday—butnever jam today.”Lord Henry, with the four young lovers of The Importance of Being Earnest,belongs to a category of sexual personae that I call the androgyne of manners,one of the most western of types. The androgyne of manners inhabits the world ofthe drawing room and recreates that world wherever it goes, through manner andspeech. The salon is an abstract circle where male and female, like mathematicalciphers, are equal and interchangeable. Personality becomes a sexuallyundifferentiated formal mask. Rousseau says of the eighteenth-century salon,“Every woman at Paris gathers in her apartment a harem of men more womanish thanshe.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note3a] The salon is politics by coterie, acity-state or gated forum run on a barter economy of gender exchange.Elegance, the ruling principle of the salon, dictates that all speech must bewit, in symmetrical pulses of repartee, a malicious stichomythia. Popecomplained that Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and the epicene Lord Hervey had “toomuch wit” for him. He sensed the icy cruelty of the beau monde, to whom moraldiscourse is alien because it elevates the inner world over the outer. Sartresays of Genet, “Elegance: the quality of conduct which transforms the greatestquantity of being into appearing.”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note4a] The salon, likethe petrified object-world venerated by the aesthete, is a spectacle of dazzlingsurfaces. Words, faces, and gestures are exhibited in a blaze of hard glamour.Though he toys with the idea of spiritual hermaphroditism, Pope loathes theandrogyne of manners, whom he satirizes as the Amazonian belles and effeminatebeaux of The Rape of the Lock. The salon is populated by sophisticates of aclassical literacy, but its speed of dialogue and worship of the ephemeralinhibit deliberation and reflection, recklessly breaking with the past. Popemight have said, had the word been available, that the salon was too chic. Theandrogyne of manners—the male feminine in his careless, lounging passivity, thefemale masculine in her brilliant, aggressive wit—has the profane sleekness ofchic.Before his career abruptly ended, Wilde was moving toward an Art Nouveauaesthetics. Art Nouveau, then at its height of decorative popularity, is a latephase in the history of style, analogous to Italian Mannerism. Kenneth Clarksays of Cellini’s and Giambologna’s streamlined Mannerist figures:The goddess of mannerism is the eternal feminine of the fashion plate. Asociologist could no doubt give ready answers why embodiments of elegance shouldtake this somewhat ridiculous shape—feet and hands too fine for honest work,bodies too thin for childbearing, and heads too small to contain a singlethought. But elegant proportions may be found in many objects that are exemptfrom these materialist explanations—in architecture, pottery, or evenhandwriting. The human body is not the basis of these rhythms but their victim.Where the sense of chic originates, how it is controlled, by what inner patternwe unfailingly recognize it—all these are questions too large and too subtle fora parenthesis. One thing is certain. Chic is not natural. Congreve’s Millamantor Baudelaire’s dandy warn us how hateful, to serious votaries of chic, iseverything that is implied by the word “nature.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note5a]Smoothness and elongation: the Mannerist figure is a chain of polished ovoidshung on a mannequin’s frame. Like Spenser’s aristocrats, Lord Henry Wotton, withhis “long nervous fingers,” is an ectomorph, an undulating ribbon of ManneristArt Nouveau. The ectomorphic line is a suave vertical, repudiating nature byresisting gravity. But the Mannerist figure, overcome by worldly fatigue, sinksback toward earth in languorous torsion. The androgyne of manners can be seen ineffete collapse in Henry Lamb’s painting of Lytton Strachey turning his back toa window, his long denatured limbs draped over an armchair like wet noodles.Because of its swift verbal genius, the androgyne of manners is best representedas sleekness and speed. Count Robert de Montesquiou, model for Huysmans’ DesEsseintes and Proust’s Charlus, was called a “greyhound in evening dress,” aperfect phrase for Lord Henry.Sleekness in a male is usually a hermaphroditic motif. Cinema evokes this themein its topos of the well-bred English “gentleman,” a word that cannot beperfectly translated into any other language. The English gentleman shows theinfluence of Castiglione’s theory of courtesy as late as the eighteenth century.Movies from the Thirties through the Fifties used actors of this kind toillustrate a singular male beauty, witty and polished, uniting sensitivity ofresponse to intense heterosexual glamour: Leslie Howard, Rex Harrison, CaryGrant, Fred Astaire, David Niven, Michael Wilding, George Hamilton. Theidiomatic qualities are smoothness and elongation: smooth both in manner andappearance, long in ectomorphic height and Nordic cranial contour. I think, forinstance, of the astounding narrowness of Cary Grant’s shiny black evening pumpsin Indiscreet (1958). The smoothness and elongation of figure are best shown offby a gleaming tuxedo, signifying a renunciation of masculine hirsutism. Thedebonair cinematic gentleman is usually prematurely balding, with hair sweptback at the temples. His receding hairline is sexually expressive, suggestinghermaphroditic gentility, a grace of intellect and emotion. The flowinghyacinthine hair of the beautiful boy traps the beholder’s eye, a portent offuture enslavement. But the sleek head of the cinematic gentleman is a promiseof candor and courtesy, of eroticism without ambivalence or suffering.Smoothness is always social in meaning: it is nature subdued by the civil madesecond nature.In The Importance of Being Earnest, the English gentleman, in whom the masculinehas been moderated by courtesy, may be seen turning into the androgyne ofmanners, in whom smoothness has become the cold glossiness of a bronze surface,like the Panzerhaft or “armoured look” of Bronzino’s Mannerist portraits.Meeting and mating with their counterparts, the play’s Art Nouveau androgynesspeak Wilde’s characteristic language, the epicene witticism, analogous to theirpersonae in its hardness, smoothness, and elongation. The Wildean epigram, likea Giambologna bronze, is immediately identifiable by a slim spareness, animperious separateness, and a perverse elegance. Wilde makes speech as hard andglittering as possible. Speech follows Wildean personality into the visualrealm. Literature normally is visual through pictorialism or metaphor. But thereare few metaphors in Wilde and no complex syntactic units. Vocabulary andsentence structure are amazingly simple, arising from the vernacular of theprofessional raconteur. Yet Wilde’s bons mots are so condensed they becomethings, artifacts. Without metaphor, his language leaps into concreteness.Language in Wilde aspires to an Apollonian hierarchism. His epigrams turnlanguage from the Dionysian “Many” into the Apollonian “One,” for as aphorismand conversation-stopper the epigram thwarts real dialogue. Cutting itself offfrom a past and future in its immediate social context, it glories inself-created aristocratic solitude. The epigram is the language of theApollonian lawgiver, arbitrarily imposing form, proportion, and measure onlife’s fluidity. A character in Wilde’s An Ideal Husband declares, “Women arenever disarmed by compliments. Men always are. That is the difference betweenthe sexes.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note6a] The iron rod of classification isthrust before us—even if it does not fall where expected! In form and content,the Wildean epigram is a triumph of rhetorical self-containment. No one inEnglish, or probably any modern language, has produced a series of utterancesmore mysteriously delimited. The Renaissance and eighteenth-century epigram wasa poem ending in sententious or sharply ironic verses. But the epigramma ofclassical antiquity was an inscription, as on a tombstone. Thus Wilde restoresthe epigram to its original representational character. His language has ahieroglyphic exactitude and cold rhetorical stoniness, separating itself fromits social background by the Apollonian incised edge.In The Importance of Being Earnest, the courtship of youth and maiden, at thetraditional heart of comedy, loses its emotional color in the Wildeantransformation of content into form, soul into surface. Jack Worthing andAlgernon Moncrieff, idle gentlemen about town, and Gwendolen Fairfax and CecilyCardew, their well-bred beloveds, are all androgynes of manners. They have nosex because they have no real sexual feelings. Wilde’s play is governed by theformalities of social life, which emerge with dancelike ritualism. The keyphrase of the English fin de siècle was Lionel Johnson’s maxim, “Life must be aritual.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note7a] In Dorian Gray, Wilde says, “The canonsof good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form isabsolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well asits unreality.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note8a] In Earnest, the ceremony of socialform is stronger than gender, shaping personae to its public purpose and turningthe internal world into the external.The play’s supreme enforcer of form is the matriarch Lady Bracknell. She too isan androgyne, a “Gorgon” with (in the original script) a “masculine mind.”9[ch25_notes.html#ch21note9a] She remarks with satisfaction, “We live, I regretto say, in an age of surfaces.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note10a] In another play,Wilde praises a butler’s Sphinx-like “impassivity”: “He is a mask with a manner.Of his intellectual or emotional life, history knows nothing. He represents thedominance of form.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note11a] An optimal performance ofEarnest would be a romance of surfaces, male and female alike wearing masks ofsuperb impassivity. The Anthony Asquith film (1952), though it shortens andcensors the text, comes close to achieving this. Joan Greenwood’s entranced,somnambulistic performance as Gwendolen—slow, stately, and ceremonious—is thebrilliant realization of the Wildean aesthetic. But the effort to make DorothyTutin’s Cecily sympathetic at Gwendolen’s expense is sentimentally intrusive, amisreading of the play disordering the symmetry between the women, twinandrogynes who fight each other to a standoff.Productions of Earnest are often weakened by flights of Forest of Ardenlyricism, which turn what is sexually ambiguous in Wilde into the conventionallyheterosexual. The play’s hieratic purity could best be appreciated if all thewomen’s roles were taken by female impersonators. Language, personality, andbehavior should be so hard that the play becomes a spectacle of visionarycoldness. The faces should be like glass, without gender or humanity. TheImportance of Being Earnest takes place in Spenser’s Apollonian “world ofglass,” a realm of glittering, sharp-edged objects. Chapman says of the goddessCeremony, “all her bodie was / Cleere and transparent as the purest glasse.”12[ch25_notes.html#ch21note12a] Gwendolen and Cecily are the goddess Ceremonyconversing with herself, her body transparent because she lacks an inner life.That Wilde may have thought of his characters in such terms is suggested inDorian Gray, where Lord Henry longs for “a mask of glass” to shield him from thechthonian “sulphurous fumes” of life.13 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note13a]Gwendolen is the first of the women to enact a drama of form. Goading Jack topropose to her, she announces in advance that she will accept him but stillinsists that her bewildered suitor scrupulously perform the traditional ritual,on his knees. Gwendolen’s thoughts never stray from the world of appearances. Atthe climax of their romantic interlude, she tells Jack, “I hope you will alwayslook at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.” Thisvoyeuristic series of observers is a psychosexual topos of Decadent LateRomanticism, which I first identified in Gautier’s Mademoiselle de Maupin.Gwendolen imagines Jack looking at her, while she looks at others looking atthem. As a worshipper of form, Gwendolen craves not emotion but display, thetheater of social life.Cecily exhibits Gwendolen’s self-observing detachment in the same situation, amarriage proposal. To Algernon’s confession of love, Cecily replies, “If youwill allow me, I will copy your remarks into my diary.” Emotion is immediatelydeflected into a self-reflexive Mannerist torsion. Moving to her writing table,Cecily exhorts her suitor to continue his wooing: “I delight in taking down fromdictation.” Intimacy swells into oratory, and poor Algernon is like Alice grownsuddenly too big for the White Rabbit’s house. Despite their impending marriage,Cecily forbids him to see her diary. But it is “meant for publication”: “When itappears in volume form I hope you will order a copy.” The Sibylline archivist,with professional impartiality, grants no special privileges to her sources ofdata.Never for a moment are Gwendolen and Cecily persuasively “female.” They arecreatures of indeterminate sex who take up the mask of femininity to play a newand provocative role. The dandified Algernon and Jack are simply supportingactors whom the women boldly stage manage. Gwendolen and Cecily are adepts of adramaturgical alchemy. They are Cerberuses on guard to defend the play againstencroachment by the internal, which they magically transform into the external.Earnest is a long process of crystallization of the immaterial into thematerial, of emotion into self-conscious personae. In Shakespeare’s volatileRosalind and Cleopatra, automanipulation of personae originates in a Renaissanceabundance of emotion, overflowing into multiple dramatic forms. But Wilde’sGwendolen and Cecily inhabit a far more stringently demarcated world, the salonof the androgyne of manners. Their personae are radically despiritualized,efflorescences not of psyche but of couture.Lady Bracknell also ruthlessly subordinates persons to form. If Algernon doesnot come to dinner, “It would put my table completely out,” and Lord Bracknellwill be banished upstairs. Apollonian symmetry is the law, at home or abroad.She rebukes Jack for being an orphan: “To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may beregarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.” Matters of formare uppermost, in life and death. Emotion is nothing, the public impressioneverything. Once again note the Late Romantic stress on visual cognition: “maybe regarded as a misfortune”; “looks like carelessness.” Every event occurs withnaked visibility on a vast, flat plain. Life is a play scrutinized by a ring ofeyes. Dorian Gray contains a major Wildean principle: “To become the spectatorof one’s own life is to escape the suffering of life.”14[ch25_notes.html#ch21note14a] Late Romantic spectatorship is an escape fromsuffering because affect is transferred from the emotional and tangible into thevisual. No wounds can pierce the glassy body of the Wildean androgyne. Theautonomous self lacks biologic or historical identity. A parent is merely adetail of social heraldry. To lose both parents, therefore, is not tragedy butnegligence, like tipping the tea service into the trash bin.The religion of form, in which Lady Bracknell as high priestess catechizes herdaughter Gwendolen, has a liturgy fixed by fashion. Its bible is any one of “themore expensive monthly magazines.” Lady Bracknell declares: “Style largelydepends on the way the chin is worn. They are worn very high, just at present.”The chin is arrogantly “worn” like a piece of clothing because the human figureis merely decorative, like the mummy’s foot used as a paperweight in Gautier.There is a latent surrealism here, for once the chin, like the perfect eyebrowof Gautier’s Cleopatra, has been detached from the body by Decadent partition,it can be worn elsewhere—on the shoulder, perhaps, or hip! Gwendolen, askingCecily’s permission to examine her through a lorgnette (Cecily graciously makesthe Late Romantic reply, “I am very fond of being looked at”), boasts that hermother “has brought me up to be extremely short-sighted.” In the salon, the bodyis self-sculpted at the whim of fashion. Gwendolen’s lorgnette is the dandy’sdisdainful monocle, his myopia signifying his hieratic self-absorption.At the tea table, Gwendolen “superciliously” declines Cecily’s offer of sugar:“No, thank you. Sugar is not fashionable any more.” To the choice of cake orbread and butter, she replies “in a bored manner”: “Bread and butter, please.Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.” Tastiness is irrelevant, sincethe body has no needs in the Apollonian world of form. Cake and sugar are itemsof décor, marks of caste by which a group separates itself from a lower group.Personal preference is renounced for hierarchic conformity. Note that cake is“rarely seen,” not eaten: its status is visual, not gustatory. Gwendolen is theandrogyne of manners rapidly approaching the android. She is as preprogrammed asa machine, seeing myopically by maternal edict, eating, drinking, hearing,thinking, speaking solely by the book. Mallarmé says Fashion (“la Mode”) is “thegoddess of appearances.” Fashion is the deity of the Wildean world of form,which Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen uphold with apostolic fervor.The term “high comedy” is too loosely applied to any comedy without physical orbroadly jokey humor. I would argue that the most advanced high comedy is amannered “presentation of self,” the ceremonial style of The Importance of BeingEarnest, as splendidly embodied in Gwendolen. Indeed, in Gwendolen Fairfax,Wilde has reached the outer limit of high comedy. Her haughtyself-hierarchization is so extreme that other characters are virtuallydispensable. But without at least two characters, drama dies. When Gwendolenspeaks, it is as much to herself or to an abstract choir of celestial observers.Like the picture of Dorian Gray, which will not stay in its assigned place andrejects its entelechy, she seems ready to abandon drama for some unknowndestination.Here is Wilde’s greatest departure from the Restoration dramatists, for hedetaches the witticism from repartee, that is, from social relationship. TheWildean witticism is a Romantic phenomenon in its proud isolationism. In thismode of high comedy, there is an elaborate ritual display of the persona, indeeda brandishing of it, like Athena’s Gorgonian aegis. I am thinking of Cellini’sMannerist Perseus, holding aloft the head of Medusa. The practitioner is in adouble relation to the self, acting but also observing. A Late Romanticconnoisseurship: the self is the subject of Decadent studiousness andscholarship. Modern androgynes of manners of this type are Edna May Oliver asHildegarde Withers, Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple, Nancy Kulp as Miss Janeon The Beverly Hillbillies, and Hermione Gingold as herself. With their fussyDecadent pedantry of word and gesture, Miss Withers, Miss Marple, and Miss Janeare the androgyne of manners in a century without a salon. Solitary, sexless,and batty, they may seem closer to the frumpy White Queen than to Wilde’sglamourous Gwendolen, but all four are first cousins in the dynastic descent ofEnglish high comedy.Let us examine several of Gwendolen’s incomparable utterances, with theirunyielding uniformity of tone. Late in the play she says, “I never change,except in my affections.” This could be a satiric caption to Pater’s Mona Lisa!Gwendolen means she is rigidly punctilious in formal, external matters, whileemotions are beneath notice, aimless flotsam and jetsam. Note the way shebrandishes her personality, flaunting her faults with triumphant self-love, apagan ostentation. Her speech always has a hard, even, relentless, andrhetorically circumscribed character, as in her first words in the play:Algernon [to Gwendolen]: Dear me, you are smart!Gwendolen: I am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?Jack: You are quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.Gwendolen: Oh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments,and I intend to develop in many directions.If we were to speak of a psychodramatic music, then in this last half-sentencewe are hearing the monody of a Gautierian contralto, the husky self-pleasuringof hermaphrodite autonomy. Identical intonations are present in two other ofGwendolen’s remarks. At one point she gratuitously informs her suitor, “In fact,I am never wrong.” And in the last act, as Jack struggles to regain heraffections, she says, “I have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intendto crush them.” Such lines must be properly read—with slow, resonant measure—inorder to appreciate their intractable severity. “I intend to develop in manydirections”: in upper-class British diction, this is flat, formal, and sonorous,forbidding with self-command. The phonology is monochromatic, the consonantssharp and vowels hooded. Its nasality is close to a sneer. Note the waypersonality is distributed throughout the sentence, filling the narrow channelof its syntax with a dense, silvery fluid, acrid and opaque. Gwendolen’swillful, elegantly linear sentences fit her like a glove. Smooth with Manneristspareness, they carry not an extra ounce of rhetorical avoirdupois. There is noPaterian mistiness in Gwendolen. She overtly relishes her personality, caressingits hard edges, echoed in the brazen contours of her sentences. In thishalf-male doyenne of Art Nouveau worldliness, Wilde has created a definitivelymodern selfhood, exposed, limited, and unsentimental, cold as urban geometry.Wilde charges Gwendolen, above all his characters, with the mission of creatingan Apollonian dramatic language. Her speech, like his own epicene witticisms,has a metallic, self-enclosed terseness. She spends her words with haughtyfrugality for the same reason that Spenser’s Belphoebe dashes off in the middleof sentences: the Apollonian is a mode of hieratic self-sequestration. The bonmot, prizing brevity, is always jealous of its means. It is a sacramentaldisplay, baring the self in epiphanic flashes, like the winking of a camerashutter. The bon mot’s spasms of delimitation are attempts to defy the temporalcharacter of speech, turning sequences of words into discrete objets. Ideas arenever developed in the Apollonian style because of its hostility to internality.The maliciously witty androgyne of manners uses language confrontationally, as adistancing weapon, like Britomart’s flaming sword. Gwendolen’s self-exhibitingutterances follow the principle of frontality, intrinsic, as Hauser observes, to“all courtly and courteous art.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note15a] Spurning themodesty of the unmarried maiden, potent Gwendolen turns herself full-face to hersuitor, bathing him with a rain of hierarchic emissions.Admiration of The Importance of Being Earnest is universal, but discussion ofthe play is scarce and slight. Critics seem to have accepted Wilde’s owndescription of it—“exquisitely trivial, a delicate bubble of fancy.” Scholarshiphas never been able to analyze this kind of high comedy, with its elusivesophistication. Frye-style myth criticism, for example, can do little withEarnest. From my view of Decadent Late Romanticism, however, every line in theplay is rich with implications.We will take two examples. Disputing with Cecily, Gwendolen declares, “I nevertravel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read inthe train.” The second sentence comes as a surprise, for ordinarily one travelswith a diary not to read but to write in. Gwendolen, however, as an Apollonianandrogyne, does not keep a journal for self-examination—inwardness beingdistasteful—but for self-display. To read one’s diary as if it were a novel isto regard one’s life as spectacle, which Wilde advocates. Gwendolen contemplatesher life with appreciative detachment, acting both as objet d’art and LateRomantic connoisseur. Reading normally means personal expansion: one reads tolearn what one does not know. But here reading is an act of Romantic solipsism.Gwendolen reads not to enlarge but to condense herself. A book, far from EmilyDickinson’s mobile frigate, has become a mirror in which one sees only one’s ownface. The diary is a selfportrait. Hence Gwendolen reading her diary in a traincompartment is exactly like Dorian Gray standing before his picture in thelocked room. Both are performing their devotions to the hierarchized self.The life recorded by her diary is, says Gwendolen, “sensational,” a source ofpublic scandal and eroticized fascination. To find one’s life sensational is tobe aroused by oneself. The eyes, as always in Late Romanticism, are sexualagents. Gwendolen reading her diary is lost in autoerotic skopophilia,titillation of the eye. If books can corrupt, and we know from Dorian Gray thatthey can, then one can be corrupted by one’s own diary. To be corrupted byoneself is sexually solipsistic, as with Goethe’s twisting acrobat Bettina,self-pleasuring and self-devirginizing. Gwendolen is an uroboros of amorousself-study, an Art Nouveau serpent devouring herself. Train reading is casualreading, passing time with minimal effort. The life recorded and contemplated inthe diary is therefore trivialized. It is just a series of sensational incidentswithout moral meaning.Reading one’s diary like a novel implies one has forgotten what is in it. Itdemonstrates a lack of moral memory typical of Decadents. In Wilde’s A Woman ofNo Importance, Lord Illingworth declares, “No woman should have a memory. Memoryin a woman is the beginning of dowdiness.” The internal erodes the Apollonianperfection of surfaces. In An Ideal Husband, someone says of his antagonist,“She looks like a woman with a past,” to which a lord replies, “Most prettywomen do.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note16a] But as we see from Gwendolen’srelations with her diary, the person with a past has no past. The self is atabula rasa open only to sensationalized impressions. There is no moralincrementation. Experience corrupts but does not instruct. Lord Henry Wottonreflects, “Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gaveto their mistakes.”17 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note17a] Reading one’s diary is adiversion of late phases of culture. Memory is inhibited because one has donetoo much, like Pater’s Mona Lisa. Her information-retrieval system blocked bysensory overload, the robotlike Gwendolen is a stranger to herself, astranger-lover.Gwendolen never travels without her diary because it is her familiar, theinseparable escort enabling her to remain in a state of Wildean externalization.This is one of many traits she shares with Cecily, who uses her diary similarly,as we saw in the proposal scene, where Cecily instantly petrifies Algernon’ssentiments midair, as if engraving them on stone tablets. Gwendolen’s diary,again like the picture of Dorian Gray, is a repository of the soul that shecarries about with her like a hatbox, preserving her soulless Apollonian purity.The diary is a chronicle, the holy testament of Gwendolen’s cult of the self. ARomantic’s diary is a personal cosmogony, a book of first and last things.Thus we see that Wilde’s witticisms contain a wealth of unsuspected meaning.Even his apparently nonsensical boutades are Late Romantic gestures. LadyBracknell tries to terminate the stormy scene at the Manor House by declaring toGwendolen, “Come, dear, we have already missed five, if not six, trains. To missany more might expose us to comment on the platform.” I have read these lines ahundred times and never cease to marvel at their bizarre genius. They have thatair of lunatic certitude we know from Lewis Carroll, who I think stronglyinfluenced Wilde. What is Lady Bracknell saying? Missing a train, even “five, ifnot six” (a Decadent precision), normally has only private and not publicconsequences. In the Looking-Glass world of form, however, failure to adhere toplan is an affront to natural law, bringing murmurs of complaint from passersby.But how do others learn of one’s deviation from a train schedule? Sinceeverything is visible in this landscape of externals and since the mental lifeof these androgynes, like their bodies, has a glassy transparency, theirintentions must precede them, like a town crier, alerting the populace to theirtardiness. In its visionary materialism, The Importance of Being Earnest revertsto the Homeric world of allegorized psychic phenomena, where enraged Achillesfeels Athena tugging at his hair. If we analyzed Lady Bracknell’s remark innaturalistic terms, we would have to speak of a megalomaniacal paranoia. Sheimagines a general consciousness of their every move; everyone knows what theyare doing and thinking. But this is a logical development of aristocraticworldliness. Fashionable life, as Proust attests, does indeed take place beforethe unblinking eyes of le tout Paris.“To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform”: Lady Bracknellexists in a force field of visual sightlines. Like Gautier’s Queen Nyssia,tainted by another’s gaze, Lady Bracknell fears being “exposed” to infection,here an infection of words. Barthes says of Sade’s novels: “The master is he whospeaks …; the object is he who is silent.”18 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note18a] LadyBracknell will lose caste if she is subject to public “comment.” Her hierarchicdominance will drain from her like divine ichor. The scene of shame sheenvisions on the railway platform is one of ritual exposure, like Hawthorne’sHester Prynne on the town scaffold. In Wilde’s world, of course, crime is notsin but bad form.The Importance of Being Earnest was the last thing Wilde wrote before his fall.Its opening night coincided with the start of Queensberry’s worst campaignagainst him, and the play continued to be performed, to great acclaim, duringhis two trials. Now it is a strange fact that Wilde’s passage to prison was aterrible fulfillment of this remark by Lady Bracknell. He recalls:On November 13th 1895 I was brought down here from London. From two o’clock tillhalf-past two on that day I had to stand on the centre platform of ClaphamJunction in convict dress and handcuffed, for the world to look at…. When peoplesaw me they laughed. Each train as it came up swelled the audience. Nothingcould exceed their amusement. That was of course before they knew who I was. Assoon as they had been informed, they laughed still more. For half an hour Istood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob. For a yearafter that was done to me I wept every day at the same hour and for the samespace of time.19 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note19a]Lady Bracknell’s railway platform was to be the site of Wilde’s greatesthumiliation. Who can doubt imagination can shape reality to its will? Emersonsays, “The soul contains the event that shall befall it; for the event is onlythe actualization of its thoughts.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note20a] So similarare these scenes of ritual exposure that I wonder if Wilde’s memory of ClaphamJunction was not a hallucination, a variation on an artistic theme in thesolitude and squalor of prison. But granting its truth, it is yet anotherexample of his shamanistic power to bring his own ideas into being. Publicationof Dorian Gray produced Lord Alfred Douglas, the beautiful boy as destroyer, whobrought Wilde down. Clapham Junction came as the agonizing materialization ofWilde’s principle of life as spectacle. The whole Late Romantic tradition ofconcentrated visual experience reaches a disastrous climax on that railwayplatform, and it ends there, with Wilde the dizzy center of the visible world,like the Ancient Mariner the focus of cosmic wrath, here taking the unbearableform of laughter. The comedian, losing control of his genre, is devoured by theaudience.The epicene witticism has received little attention, partly because it fits nocritical categories. Thus Wilde’s plays are deemed worthy of explication, whilehis conversation is not. But the androgyne of manners, typified by Wildehimself, makes an art of the spoken word, which we can examine only whenpreserved by a Boswell-like amanuensis. Wilde, with his radical formalism,created an original language I call the monologue extérieur. I believe that themodern epicene, spoken by male homosexuals, is a survival of Late Romanticismand that it constitutes an unacknowledged lost poetry.Wilde’s epigrams resemble the one-liners of American stand-up comedy, developedout of vaudeville by Jewish entertainers. Woody Allen uses the axiomatic styleas an acerbic trope: “What if everything is an illusion and nothing exists? Inthat case, I definitely overpaid for my carpet.”21 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note21a]Where Wilde and Allen differ is in their persona-construction. The Jewishwitticism can be just as harsh as the Wildean, but it always contains a residueof suffering or victimization. A Brooklyn grandmother said of a neighbor, “She’shad so many operations, her stomach is like the map of Jerusalem.” The Jewishwitticism reflects the social history of its people in imagining persons aspassive to harrowing external circumstance. The persona latent in Woody Allen’scomedy is the male heroine or schlemiel, a clumsy bumbler. The persona latent inthe Wildean witticism is a hierarch, the androgyne as social despot.The epicene witticism is a rhetorical bonding of masculine and feminine.Geoffrey Hartman says Wordsworth’s simple “pointless” style helped liberatemodern poetry from “the tyranny of the witty style,” the Augustan forte. Dr.Johnson’s definition of literary “point” is “a sting of an epigram; a sentenceterminated with some remarkable turn of words or thought.”22[ch25_notes.html#ch21note22a] That Wordsworth avoids epigrammatic thrust (asubliminally phallic word) is logical, since he is a poet who qualifiesintellect with feminine tenderness. The salon dialogue of the androgyne ofmanners is a duel of “cutting” remarks. Language is used aggressively as a toolof masculine warfare to slash, stab, pierce, and penetrate. Dorian Gray says toLord Henry, “You cut life to pieces with your epigrams.”23[ch25_notes.html#ch21note23a] It is no coincidence that terms describing a wittyexchange—thrust, parry, riposte, repartee—come from swordplay. The interrelationof language and martial combat in western culture is demonstrated by fencingparlance that speaks of a “conversation” or “phrase” of action. Thus we see howa woman of the salon who commands this sharp, challenging rhetoric ismasculinized into an androgyne of manners. The male androgyne of mannerscombines aggressive language with a feminine manner, graceful, languid, andarchly flirtatious. The persona of Wilde’s epicene witticisms conflatesmasculine intimidation and attack with feminine seduction and allure.To “cut” someone is to wound him, but it is also to sever social connectionswith him. Carroll puns on this duality, when Alice is introduced to the leg ofmutton:“May I give you a slice?” she said, taking up the knife and fork, and lookingfrom one Queen to the other.“Certainly not,” the Red Queen said, very decidedly: “it isn’t etiquette to cutany one you’ve been introduced to. Remove the joint!”24[ch25_notes.html#ch21note24a]Wilde’s witticisms operate by systematic “cutting,” separating the self fromcommunality and withdrawing it into aristocratic sequestration. Language in TheImportance of Being Earnest is a mode of hierarchical placement. It is a seriesof psychodramatic gestures, each remark asserting a caste location vis-à-vissome other person or class of person. The speakers are constantly positioningthemselves at fixed distances from others. This even occurs, as we saw, in themarriage proposals, where the heroines befuddle the heroes by ceremonialdemarcations, bulletins of incipient intimacy, which they narrate likeplay-by-play sportscasters. To paraphrase: “We will shortly be intimate”; “Weare now being intimate”; “Pray continue to be intimate.” The Wildean heroine isa hierarchical commentator, plotting the relations of personae on a mental map.Wilde’s use of language as signs of placement is overt in the tea-table clash.Cecily says, “When I see a spade I call it a spade.” Gwendolen replies, “I amglad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is obvious that our socialspheres have been widely different.” This literalized metaphor, a Wildeanmaterialization, makes a spade, like sugar or cake, a calibrator of caste.Gwendolen glories in her self-expanded hierarchical distance from Cecily. Theplay opens with Algernon playing the piano: “I don’t play accurately—anyone canplay accurately—but I play with wonderful expression.” Anyone can playaccurately: this false, self-absolving premise, like a ladder leaned against awall, stretches a great chain of being before us, with Algernon exulting overthe masses from a top rung of aesthetical “sensibility.” Wilde uses thetechnique everywhere. His spokesman in The Critic as Artist says, “When peopleagree with me I always feel that I must be wrong.” A character in An IdealHusband says, “Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.”25[ch25_notes.html#ch21note25a] Rhetorical energy is devoted to socialdifferentiation and segregation. Wilde’s Apollonian goal was to create hierarchythrough wit, ennobling himself, like self-naming Balzac, through a magisterialpersona-construction.Hence the epicene witticism is a language of hierarchic command in sexuallyaberrant or rather sexually denatured form. Wilde’s pointed style descends fromthe eighteenth century and particularly from Pope, whose poetry he vociferouslydisliked. Brigid Brophy thinks Wilde’s epigram “an adaptation of the logicalaxiom and the scientific definition,” owing something to “the Irish—perhapsoriginally the theological—habit of paradox.”26 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note26a]Wilde’s epigrams, which so obstruct the quickness of Restoration repartee,acquire their substantiveness from Enlightenment generalization. It is hisintellectual power of generalization that gives Wilde’s writing its permanentdistinction. A modern play in the Wildean manner, Noel Coward’s Private Lives(1930), has only one true Wildean line: “Certain women should be struckregularly, like gongs.”27 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note27a] And even thisgeneralization vulgarizes Wilde, in whom contemplativeness is never distorted byaction.Pope was the first to make poetic beauty out of philosophy, devising an elegantdiscursive style of Apollonian containment and high finish. Pope’s social andrhetorical assumptions were transmitted to Wilde, apparently against his will,by the conservative Jane Austen, in whom we first detect Wilde’s distinctivevoice, tart, bantering, and lucid. Consider, for example, the great openingsentence of Austen’s Emma: “Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with acomfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the bestblessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world withvery little to distress or vex her.”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note28a] There is adelicate play of modern irony about the psychological perimeter of this sentencethat is almost impossible to arrest and define. It is an atmospheric rippling,an undulating vocal convection. The sentence contains the whole novel.Rhetorically, it is a glissando from eighteenth-century to nineteenth-centurystyle. The grand public oratory of “handsome, clever, and rich” sinks down tothe small, homely “vex,” the thorn that will prick the bubble of Emma’s pride.As the sentence ends, we hear the new obliqueness of modern writing and almostsee the author’s hidden smile. Philosophically, Austen’s novels, thoughcontemporaneous with High Romanticism, affirm the eighteenth-century world-view,with its neoclassic endorsement of the sexually normative. Only in Emma is thereanything sexually ambivalent (Emma’s infatuation with Harriet), and even thereit is slight and discreet.Wilde diverts Jane Austen’s comedy into the epicene through his own identity asa Decadent. Augustan wit is aligned with divinely ordered nature, from whichWilde makes a Late Romantic swerve. This antinaturism helps him eliminate thepornography of Restoration comedy. Human lusts no longer exist in The Importanceof Being Earnest. Even Algernon’s perpetual hunger is an angelic appetite, forthe characters feed on things insubstantial as manna: bread and butter, cucumbersandwiches, muffins, crumpets, and tea cake. They are like theBread-and-butter-fly of Through the Looking-Glass, whose head is a lump of sugarand who lives on weak tea with cream. Wilde uses Jane Austen to clarify highcomedy, stripping away the broad and farcical elements present in it sinceShakespeare. There are no longer any low-comic or crudely dialectal interludes.Even Earnest’s secondary characters are erudite verbalists. (Miss Prism: “Ispoke horticulturally. My metaphor was drawn from fruits.”) Wilde prunes andsimplifies high comedy by Augustan standards of taste, decorum, and correctness.There is a second influence in Wilde’s epicene transformation of Jane Austen. Heis aided by the one wit who stands between himself and her: Lewis Carroll.Carroll detaches English comedy from the ethical (present even in Restorationdrama, with its virtuous finales) and prepares it for its definitiveamoralization by Wilde. After Wilde, this genre of glittering high comedy isconfined to the epicene and can be practiced only by sex-crossingimaginations—Ronald Firbank, Noel Coward, Cole Porter. Carroll’s sexualambiguity is not textually overt, but it is quite obvious in his life. Hisfriends and biographers speak of his long hair and “curiously womanish face,”his fascination with little girls, his dislike of boys, which his nephewdescribed as “an aversion, almost amounting to terror.” Carroll said of boys,“To me they are not an attractive race of beings.” And another time: “Boys arenot in my line: I think they are a mistake.”29 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note29a]Carroll’s spiritual identity was thoroughly feminine.Dramatically, the Alice books are supported by the stability of Victorian socialstructure. Alice is an imperialist of custom. Thrust into an irrationaldream-world, she remains serene and self-assured, a model of well-bredcomposure. In her firm sense of appropriate behavior, she is twin to thatsnappish menagerie of potentates, human and animal, who chide her fortransgressions of mysterious local codes of conduct. There is even a surprisingcultural kinship between Alice and her chief critic, the fierce Red Queen, whomCarroll elsewhere describes as “formal and strict, … the concentrated essence ofall governesses.”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note30a] But the Red Queeen is agoverness only insofar as the governess is the first representative of thehierarchical in the lives of English children, ruling as a regent in the name ofsociety.Carroll did not, I contend, hold the Romantic or modern view that social lawsare artificial and false. On the contrary, he took an Apollonian pleasure inthem, admiring and cherishing them as he did the theorems and equations hemanipulated as an academic mathematician. One of his first published pieces as ayoung man at Oxford was “Hints for Etiquette; or, Dining Out Made Easy”:IIn proceeding to the dining-room, the gentleman gives one arm to the lady heescorts—it is unusual to offer both.IIITo use a fork with your soup, intimating at the same time to your hostess thatyou are reserving the spoon for the beefsteaks, is a practice wholly exploded.VIIWe do not recommend the practice of eating cheese with a knife and fork in onehand, and a spoon and wine-glass in the other; there is a kind of awkwardness inthe action which no amount of practice can entirely dispel.VIIIAs a general rule, do not kick the shins of the opposite gentleman under thetable, if personally unacquainted with him; your pleasantry is liable to bemisunderstood—a circumstance at all times unpleasant.31[ch25_notes.html#ch21note31a]It would be a typically modern error to assume that this is an essay in“debunking,” that Carroll is reducing manners to the absurd to demonstrate thefictiveness of social custom. But everything shows him to have been aninflexible advocate of order. A contemporary speaks of Carroll’s “rigid rule ofhis own life,” his fixed daily routine. Another says he was “austere, shy,precise, … watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative inpolitical, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares likeAlice’s landscape.” Phyllis Greenacre calls him “a compulsive indexer,”ceaselessly filing and documenting his possessions.32[ch25_notes.html#ch21note32a]The evidence suggests that rules and manners in “Hints for Etiquette” and theAlice books draw their force from Lewis Carroll’s faith in theirtradition-consecrated, a priori character. His comedy arises from a nativelyEnglish love of formality and ceremony. There is a tonality of wit in Carrollthat is unparalleled in premodern literature but that appears throughoutVirginia Woolf. Note the similarities of voice between his “Hints for Etiquette”and this letter to Victoria Sackville-West, in which Woolf reviews the commentsroused by her newly bobbed hair:1. Virginia is completely spoilt by her shingle.2. Virginia is completely made by her shingle.3. Virginia’s shingle is quite unnoticeable.These are the three schools of thought on this important subject. I have boughta coil of hair, which I attach by a hook. It falls into the soup, and is fishedout on a fork.33 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note33a]This sophisticated comic style is produced in England by an unexploredinteraction between language and persona.Woolf’s mealtime falling coil descends from the courtly mutton, peevish pudding,and talking soup tureen of Alice’s banquet. The deep structure of such passages:an excessive or unexpected event occurs within the strict confines ofconvention. The dining table is a favorite locus of display, as the arena ofdaily ritual. But the incident evokes no reaction, or only a muted one. Allpersonae remain in dignified flat affect, preserving the rule of normality. Thehighest English comedy is predicated on Wildean impassivity, the proverbialstiff upper lip. Woolf’s letter, in fact, allows three diverse reactions tocancel each other out, cleverly effecting a return to stasis. The energydeflected from reaction flows into the moment’s social structure, which is feltwith architectural solidity, vibrating with public power.Woolf’s shingle saga is really about British impersonality and detachment.Person is detached from person; mind is detached from body; the coil isliterally detached before plunging into the soup. Woolf speaks of herself in theimpersonal third person: the public self-who-is-seen is detached from theinvisible self-who-writes. The letter parodies Bloomsbury art criticism, thebequest of Pater and Wilde. Person is objet d’art. Therefore we hear threeviews, three peremptory, mutually contradictory voices in heated debate before apainting or sculpture. “Virginia” is a neo-primitif found object. She is like amannequin gussied up and trundled out for display. The coil of hair is attachedas clinically as one would screw in a lightbulb, and it seems to tumble soupwardby the accumulation of received opinions. The only things the mandarin Woolfdoes are consent to the shingle and buy the coil. Everything else is experiencedpassively: the commentary by others, the fall of the coil. Even the rescue ofcoil from soup may not be hers. The coil “is fished out,” as if it were aregular event, ritually dealt with by the forks of all. Is this satire ofCambridge anthropology? In English discourse, the self is an amused observer oflife. The self is public yet somehow isolated, presiding with unflappable aplombfrom a temenos of reserve and decorum.Carroll’s Alice books introduced an epicene element into English discourse that,consolidated by Wilde, flourishes to this day. Development of the Englishepicene was facilitated by the cultural availability of the persona of thegentleman. English society is also noted for a toleration of eccentricity, ataste for sadomasochistic erotica, and a high incidence of male homosexuality,stimulated by the monasticism of public-school and university life. Goetheexclaimed at the youthful verve of the dashing Englishmen who visited Weimar andmade the ladies swoon.34 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note34a] From at least theeighteenth century, we can identify as a distinct sexual persona the exuberantEnglish aristocrat, positive, active, and amusing. The English have a maturityof manner in youth and a youthfulness in maturity; hence they achieve an idealage, the aesthetic balance sought by high classic Greek art.Carroll synthesized several potent forces in English high culture: wit,hierarchy, and spiritual hermaphroditism. After Carroll, English comedy, inliterature and educated speech, tends toward the absurd and incongruous, inwhich there is always a shadow of the epicene. The upper-class English taste forflights of fluty affectation originates, I am convinced, in the Alice books. Anexample from E. M. Forster’s Howards End (1910):Then the door opened, and “Mr. Wilcox, Miss Wilcox” entered, preceded by twoprancing puppies. “Oh, the dears! Oh, Evie, how too impossibly sweet!” screamed Helen, fallingon her hands and knees.35 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note35a]The comedy comes from the context of British formality. The impassive Wildeanbutler, invisible guardian of decorum, is the palace wall against which Helen’sscreechy zaniness caroms like a tennis ball. Formality is the key to highcomedy, a principle escaping today’s inept Hollywood directors. I Love Lucy, forexample, profits from its grounding in strict Fifties social conventions. Thuswhen Lucy sits on Charles Boyer’s hat, squirts him with ink, rips his coat, andhits his head with the door, it’s hilarious—not because of slapstick but becauseof the breach of Boyer’s hierarchic decorum. Only the British can still createhigh comedy of this kind, because of their culture’s lingering formality. InForster, Helen’s excess of response, sparked by the unschooled pups, explodesfrom the repressed energy of the social norm. She speaks a heightened, hieratic,nonsensical language. What is an impossible sweetness? And what is the tooimpossible? We must turn back in defeat. Helen is darting into the linguisticinfinite on a jet of the English epicene.Next an example from Frederick Raphael’s Oscar-winning screenplay for Darling(1965). The animated Diana (Julie Christie), recalling her meteoric rise, says,“Suddenly, one felt madly in!” Like Helen’s outburst, this rush of Britisheffervescence has a pointed epigrammatic structure, climaxing in a Johnsoniansting. Note the sense of caste groupings and the detached British impersonalityof “one felt” (instead of “I felt”), jostling the slangy Sixties trendiness of“in.” The sentence’s Apollonian limitations of form and content barely containthe abandoned “madly,” with its hectic social whirl. “Madly” has the epiceneextravagance of fashionable discourse. A contributor to Nancy Mitford’s analysisof “U” or upper-class British culture says, “As in the eighteenth century,U-conversation is larded with vehement and extreme adjectives (ghastly,frightful, disastrous, nauseating), but they are no more intended to be taken aupied de la lettre than the unprintable epithets so freely used by soldiers.”36[ch25_notes.html#ch21note36a] In the salon, all emotions are sensationalized.Language carries more in order to mean less. The final irony of “one felt madlyin” is that “in” has tauntingly reversed its meaning, turning itself into anecstatic pinpoint of worldly externalization. To be “in” is paradoxically tohave leapt into total hierarchic visibility.Books and films about Hollywood stars gravitate toward an epicene style, becausea star’s career is based on image, on hierarchic display and a conflation ofsightlines, the eyes of a vast, admiring audience. Thus Joseph L. Mankiewicz’All About Eve (1950), with its rising and falling stars, automatically adoptsthe Wildean wit of the English epicene. In the edgy party scene, Bette Davis asMargo Channing finds her husband tittering with her unscrupulous protégé. Hesays amiably, “I was just telling Eve about the time I looked into the wrong endof a camera finder.” Davis furiously snaps back, in a great Carrollian sally,“Remind me to tell you about the time I looked into the heart of an artichoke!”At a cocktail party, only the artichokes have hearts. Fidelity or emotion has noclaims upon the externalized world of socialite and star. The soul has shrunk tothe new Vitruvian proportions of an hors d’oeuvre. All About Eve’s artichokeheart is Pope’s “A trifling head, and a contracted heart,” dollhouse bibelots ofthe salon (Dunciad IV, 504). The envy-green book of the heart iratelyscrutinized by Bette Davis is like the engraved cigarette case rudely “read” byWilde’s Algernon, bronzed leaves of denatured sophistication.Darling is another adventure in modern image: Julie Christie plays a commercialmodel whose picture is plastered all over London. The script follows its starinto a Wildean externalization. Her disillusioned lover (Laurence Harvey) saysto her disdainfully, “Put away your Penguin Freud, Diana.” He is accusing thefaithless Diana of simplistic psychologizing, as if from an elementary primer, apopularized Penguin edition. He implies a star cannot possibly make emotionaljudgments, because of her perfect soullessness. Such lines demonstrate the easewith which the English epicene shifts into allegory because of its Wildeanmaterialism. As in Dante, multiple levels operate simultaneously. As the realJulie Christie listens to Harvey speak, the allegorical Julie Christie may beseen on the next level up, as on the mezzanine of a department store, an openpaperback in her hand!The English epicene, jointly created by Carroll and Wilde, can be found in manyplaces: Sir Frederick Ashton’s sleek choreography for the Royal Ballet; thetelevision series The Avengers; and John Lennon’s punning witticisms,moralistically stripped from him by his Japanese wife, Yoko Ono, in hermisunderstanding of the fertile western fusion between aggression and intellect.What Carroll did, first of all, was to invent a non-chthonian animism: he givesRomantic nature a social voice. The Alice books are a din of creatures, speakingas uncompromising social hierarchs. There is no tenderness in Carroll’scharacters, save in the bumbling and ineffectual, like the senile White Knight.All are sharp, forceful personalities, nodes of aggressive selfhood. The Alicebooks, like Earnest, are glutted with rules of behavior, which pop up atimprobable moments, as when Alice tries to cut a slice of the protesting plumpudding: “‘Make a remark’, said the Red Queen: ‘it’s ridiculous to leave all theconversation to the pudding!’”37 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note37a] Carroll’s RedQueen will become Lady Bracknell, just as his Ugly Duchess, tossing her babyabout like a bladderball, will become Miss Prism, “a female of repellent aspect”who mislays an infant in a handbag.Formality is Carroll’s preeminent principle, governing not only the narrativedesign (a pack of cards structuring the first book and a chessboard the second),but the characters’ psychodramatic style, a punctilious ritualism like Carroll’sown. The noisiest examples are the ritual combats of Tweedledum and Tweedledeeand the Lion and the Unicorn, which erupt again and again. Carroll’s charactersfollow compulsive cycles of speech and behavior, which Alice inspects as ifmoving from one museum diorama to the next. Each is a celebrant of personalceremony, pagan priest of a pastoral shrine. The Red Queen’s draconianchampionship of good manners is merely the most blatant of the ritual formulasof Carroll’s animistic world. Manners are the public language of hierarchy.Thorstein Veblen calls manners “symbolical and conventionalised survivalsrepresenting former acts of dominance or of personal service”: “They are anexpression of the relation of status,—a symbolic pantomime of mastery on the onehand and of subservience on the other.”38 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note38a]The ancient history of manners as power energizes Gwendolen and Cecily’sclimactic confrontation, the center not only of Earnest but, in my view, ofWilde’s entire oeuvre. In one of the few things on Wilde worth reading, MaryMcCarthy, as a Thirties leftist, is oblivious to this, speaking of the scene’s“tedium” and “exhausting triviality.”39 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note39a] Yet hersatirical novel, The Group (1963), is a triumph of the English epicene style. Ina tableau of brilliant formal beauty, Wilde makes a tea table the arena of aferocious war game, with manners the medium of ritual advance and retreat.Gwendolen and Cecily manipulate their personae with chill virtuosity. Nowhere isit clearer that the gender of the androgyne of manners is purely artificial,that femininity in the salon is simply a principle of decorum shared by male andfemale.The women’s escalating emotion is completely absorbed by the ceremonialframework and by the formality of their social masks.Cecily [rather shy and confidingly]: Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why Ishould make a secret of it to you. Our little county newspaper is sure tochronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are engaged to bemarried.Gwendolen [quite politely, rising]: My darling Cecily, I think there must besome slight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me. The announcement willappear in the Morning Post on Saturday at the latest.Cecily [very politely, rising]: I am afraid you must be under somemisconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. [Shows diary.]Gwendolen [examines diary through her lorgnette carefully]: It is very curious,for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5:30. If you would care toverify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of her own.]Each gesture, each rhetorical movement is answered by a symmetricalcountermovement of balletic grandeur. Language becomes increasingly elaborate,in baroque convolutions of ironic restraint: “It would distress me more than Ican tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it caused you any mental or physical anguish,but I feel bound to point out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly haschanged his mind.” There is no hysteria, or even excitement. The women’simmovable wills press so fiercely against the social limits of the moment thatthe hierarchical structure of manners leaps into visibility, another Wildeanmaterialization. Stylization and ritualism approach the Oriental. The scene is aJapanese tea ceremony where gracious self-removal yields to naked Achilleanstrife—with the bone of contention a chimeric fiancé. Gwendolen and Cecily,negotiating with frosty British efficiency, are heavenly bodies circling anearthly clod. They seek power and territoriality, not romance.Lewis Carroll made this great episode possible. In Carroll, manners and sociallaws are disconnected from humane or “civilizing” values. They have amathematical beauty but no moral meaning: they are absurd. But this absurdity ispredicated not on a democratic notion of their relativism but on theirarbitrary, divine incomprehensibility. In the Alice books, manners aremeaningless but still retain their hierarchical force. They are Veblen’s“pantomime” of mastery and subservience. Wilde sets Carroll’s view of themechanisms of social power into a larger system of aristocratic assumptions,derived partly from his identity as a Baudelairean Decadent Late Romantic(always reactionary and anti-liberal) and partly from his reading of Englishdrama, in which aristocracy is a moral idea. The leading interpreter of thisaspect of English literature is G. Wilson Knight, who speaks of kingship inShakespeare as “a dramatic intensification of personality,” the “objectifiedsuper-self” or “Eros-music” of each citizen.40 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note40a] TheEnglish have invested extraordinary imagination in the institution ofaristocracy, ceremonial symbol of the nation’s history.In a century of middle-class values, to which even the queen subscribed, Wildereaffirms aristocratic virtù, fabricating it out of its accumulated meanings inEnglish literature. The Importance of Being Earnest is a reactionary politicalpoem that makes aristocratic style the supreme embodiment of life as art.Through its masquelike use of manners as social spectacle, the play seeks outthe crystallized idea or Platonic form of aristocracy, which resides in rank,the ascending great chain of being. Wilde’s bons mots are the Logos of hisApollonian cosmos. Language and ceremony unite to take hierarchy to its farthestdazzling point, until it becomes form without content, like the lacy latticeworkof a snowflake. Thus the play’s characters have abnormal attitudes, reactions,and customs and embark upon sequences of apparently irrational thought, for theyare a strange hierarchic race, the aristoi.Earnest is inspired by the glamour of aristocracy alone, divorced from socialfunction. Here it departs from Augustan literature, which celebrates Anne’s wiseand stable rule. In Wilde, no collective benefits flow from throne or court,where the upper class is at perpetual play. No contemporary régime is eulogized,no past one nostalgically commemorated. Society is divorced from practicalreality. Class structure in Wilde exists as art, as pure form. In Earnest,unlike the speech on “degree” by Shakespeare’s Ulysses, order is admired notbecause it is right or just but because it is beautiful. In fact, order heremakes no intellectual sense at all. In Carrollian terms, it is absurd. Hence itis an error, and a common one, to say that Wilde is “satirizing” Lady Bracknell,making her ridiculous in her haughty presumptions. Lady Bracknell is beautifulbecause she is absurd. Aristocracy in Earnest satisfies aesthetic and not moraldemands. The world of the play is kosmios, well-ordered and comely. And that itis ruled by the chic makes sense, since this word’s descent resembles that of“cosmetic” from “cosmos”: the French “chic” is apparently a version of theGerman Schick, meaning taste, elegance, and order.Outside his art, Wilde found himself in the same quandary as Coleridge andSwinburne, anxiously attempting apologia and moral revision of their daemonicpoems. Thus he says in The Soul of Man Under Socialism: “All authority is quitedegrading. It degrades those who exercise it, and degrades those over whom it isexercised.”41 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note41a] Wilde was torn between hisinstinctive hierarchism as an Apollonian idealist and the liberalism towardwhich he was impelled by the miseries of being homosexual in a Christiansociety. This led him into glaring self-contradictions. For example, at hisfirst trial, Wilde was questioned about his relations with working-class youths.Carson.Did you know that one, Parker, was a gentleman’s valet, and the other a groom?Wilde.I did not know it, but if I had I should not have cared. I don’t care twopencewhat they were. I liked them. I have a passion to civilize the community.Carson.What enjoyment was it to you to entertain grooms and coachmen?Wilde.The pleasure to me was being with those who are young, bright, happy, careless,and free. I do not like the sensible and I do not like the old..... Carson.What was there in common between this young man and yourself? What attractionhad he for you?Wilde.I delight in the society of people much younger than myself. I like those whomay be called idle and careless. I recognize no social distinctions at all ofany kind; and to me youth, the mere fact of youth, is so wonderful that I wouldsooner talk to a young man for half-an-hour than be—well, cross-examined inCourt!Carson.Do I understand that even a young boy you might pick up in the street would be apleasing companion?Wilde.I would talk to a street arab, with pleasure.Carson.You would talk to a street arab?Wilde.Yes, with pleasure. If he would talk to me.42 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note42a]In these responses, Wilde is in mauvaisefoi. It is patently untrue that he“recognized no social distinctions at all of any kind.” Like Proust, he was vainof his traffic with the rich and titled. Of great English writers after theeighteenth century, Wilde is the most guilty of snobbery. His pleasure in thecompany of the déclassé, which he defends as liberal broad-mindedness, must betranslated into the terms of Dorian Gray. What Wilde on the witness stand calls“youth, the mere fact of youth” is really beauty, and specifically male beauty.The apparent absence of “social distinctions” conceals dogmatic faith in anotherhierarchical system, Plato’s cult of divine beauty in human form.The Wildean epicene unites English drama’s theme of aristocracy with LateRomanticism. First, Wilde severs Jane Austen’s eighteenth-century hierarchicalvalues from the idea of commonweal: he treats society simply as an ornate objetd’art or cotillion ball. Second, he sexually volatizes English wit. The charmingbanter of the celibate Austen and Carroll becomes epicene in Wilde because ofhis sexual experience, which shifts him into Decadence. Since, as RichardEllmann long ago observed, Wilde did his best work after turning homosexual, artfor him was inextricably linked with criminality. Perhaps the society glorifiedby a homosexual wit can be no larger than the salon. Wilde demonstrates thecongruities between high society and the male-homosexual world. One, alreadymentioned, is image, a tyranny of the visual. Two others are scandal and gossip.Gwendolen, we saw, calls her diary “sensational.” To say or do somethingscandalous is to create a sensation, literally an erotic frisson of shock.Arousal is generated at physical remove, over that aesthetic distance I perceivein Apollonian phenomena.The salon is a western drama of seeing and saying. Works of epicene wit aretherefore always dominated by gossip. In Clare Boothe Luce’s The Women (1939), acult film among male homosexuals, Rosalind Russell plays a gossip-drunk matronin a constant frenzy of discovery and disclosure. Like Vergil’s Rumor, she hasmultiple eyes: grotesque Gorgonian eye-brooches pinned all over her bodice. TheCountess (Mary Boland), the film’s Wildean hierarch, murmurs “L’amour, l’amour”as her epithet, altering it at the boisterous climax to “La publicité!” Love inthe salon is only publicity. Gossip as a form of erotic displacement is alsoevident in Jessica Walter’s superb performance as a frigid opportunist in thefilm of The Group (1966). Mirror-gazing Libby is a sensationalizing telephonemonologuist, substituting words for sexual action. Someone speaks of “that redscar she calls a mouth.” As usual, western culture fuses eroticism with verbalaggression. Libby’s lushly painted lips are the duelling scar of a Wildeandespot of febrile, worldly wit.There is no scandal or gossip in the Alice books because they have no sexual“free energy.” Carroll is an annalist of aggression but not of eroticism. InWilde, however, gossip intensifies the aura of glamour that signifies prestigein the salon. Algernon says of a widow, “I hear her hair has turned quite goldfrom grief.” A character in A Woman of No Importance remarks, “It is said, ofcourse, that she ran away twice before she was married. But you know how unfairpeople often are. I myself don’t believe she ran away more than once.” A lorddeclares, “It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, sayingthings against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely true.” Themorning after Sibyl’s suicide in Dorian Gray, Lord Henry callously says, “Thingslike that make a man fashionable in Paris. But in London people are soprejudiced.”43 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note43a] The gossip “item” of Paris orHollywood is like the chin that Lady Bracknell turns into a detached item ofWildean décor. Both are heraldic accretions to persona. The erotic excitation ofscandal and gossip leads to the volatility of Wildean wit. Words cast off theirmoral meanings and escape into the sexually transcendental, leaving only vaportrails of flirtation and frivolity.Oscar Wilde was the formulator of personal style for the modern male homosexual.Thus, for most of this century, the male-homosexual world replicated the salon,even in dingy bars in provincial cities. In the Twenties, while touring with aroad show of female impersonators, Mae West was asked why she consorted onlywith male and never female homosexuals. She replied, “Lesbians are not humorouspersons.” From Wilde’s life and work came the aesthetic of high camp, anApollonian mode of comedy and connoisseurship. As Mae attests, lesbians as agroup have never been either camp or comic. The male homosexual, by his Wildeanself-conceptualization, carries on the work of western imagination. Even today,as camp has faded, part of the male-homosexual world still follows a vanishedaristocratic code: class consciousness, racial stratification, amoral venerationof youth, beauty, and glamour, love of scandal and gossip, and use of thestinging bon mot and theatrical persona of the androgyne of manners. ThusWilde’s English epicene has secretly transmitted British hierarchism to otherlands and other times.The caste system of The Importance of Being Earnest is ruled by Lady Bracknell,with her head-on Gorgonian confrontationalism. She even rings doorbells in a“Wagnerian manner.” Her domineering pronouncements have an exalted, trumpetlikesound. In the film, Dame Edith Evans, the definitive Lady Bracknell, sits in thetrain bound for the Manor House accompanied by blasts of loud, imposing music.She serenely faces us in courtly frontality, like a dynastic totem. The shotprefigures Diane Arbus’ photograph, “Woman with a Veil on Fifth Avenue” (1968),where a dowager’s turbaned head shows the same masculine massiveness. ElsewhereWilde says, “Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twentyyears of marriage make her something like a public building.”44[ch25_notes.html#ch21note44a] Lady Bracknell’s function as stern guardian ofsocial convention has given her an architectural character. She is masculinizedby the principle of hierarchic abstraction I saw at work in Egyptianmonumentality.The one mother of Wilde’s play is far from indulgent toward emotion or romance.As champion of public form, Lady Bracknell insists on arranged marriages. Like aRoman matron, she is contemptuous of illness or weakness. She resembles HenryJames’s grandes dames or the Marx Brothers’ high-society hostess, played byMargaret Dumont, whose wide face, ample bosom, and statuesque height symbolizethe solidity and stolidity of institutions. What is Wildean in Dumont is hervacancy. Brilliant smiles and withering glances alternate in her face with daffyregularity. All emotions are transient, because no emotion goes very deep. LikeWilde’s androgynes, she has no memory, starting each moment fresh, no matterwhat insult she suffers from the delirious, Dionysian Marx Brothers. LadyBracknell has more control over her fictive world. Her self-assertions areflashes of mesmerizing female power. Male homosexuals have made “bitchiness,”applied to dominant women, a peculiar positive. “She’s such a bitch,” they sayapprovingly of egotists like Barbra Streisand. I identify the locution asanother hierarchism. Lady Bracknell is a bitch of this kind, unjust, immoderate,dictatorial.Of the play’s heroes, Algernon is more the effeminate aesthete. Like Lord HenryWotton, he speaks “languidly” and is “always overdressed”; his flat is“luxuriously and artistically furnished.” In the original script, he cries,“Exercise! Good God! No gentleman ever takes exercise. You don’t seem tounderstand what a gentleman is.”45 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note45a] Algernon holdsthe Late Romantic view of the vulgar inauthenticity of action. When Jack rebukeshim for “calmly eating muffins” during a crisis, he replies, “Well, I can’t eatmuffins in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs.”Muffin-eating is the only action he is guilty of. Energy is merely agitation, aDionysian centrifuge spraying butter about the room, besmirching the burnishedworld of surfaces. Jack can also be epicene: he finds both town and country life“excessively boring”; he accepts Lady Bracknell’s definition of his smoking as aworthy fulltime “occupation.” In performance, the differences between Jack andAlgernon should not be significant. They are Romantic doubles who driftfatefully together. The play resembles Balzac’s The Girl with the Golden Eyes inthe way that siblings separated at birth locate each other by telepathicmagnetism. Furthermore, Jack and Algernon, like undergraduates packing atelephone booth, try to crowd into the same identity, that of the make-believeErnest.The symmetry between Wilde’s suitors corresponds to the far fuller symmetrybetween the two women, which the film spoils by fomenting populist antagonismagainst the elitist Gwendolen. The greatness of the tea-table scene is lost ifthe audience is lured into siding with Cecily. Its beauty depends on Apollonianbalance, military parity between ferocious opponents. Gwendolen and Cecily arelike Rossetti’s duplex females, dancing in the bower meadow. Their Romantictwinning is obvious in those two moments when they have simultaneous thoughtsand chant aloud in uncannily synchronized sentences. Wilde’s female twins havefused into a single hierarchic personality. They differ only in aristocraticstyle, of which Gwendolen is a consummate master. She fulfills Goethe’sdefinition of the nobleman: “A certain stately grace in common things, a sort ofgay elegance in earnest and important ones.” Asking “What is noble?” Nietzschereplies as if to describe Gwendolen: “Apparent frivolity in word, dress,bearing, through which a stoic severity and self-constraint protects itselfagainst all immodest inquisitiveness. Slowness of gesture, and of glance.” Sheis like Veblen’s gentleman of the “highest leisure class,” who has “a divineassurance and an imperious complaisance, as of one habituated to requiresubservience and to take no thought for the morrow.”46[ch25_notes.html#ch21note46a] Cecily has not reached this level ofsophistication, because of her rural life. But once wed in London, she willsurely make rapid progress in the school of Wildean worldliness. Lady Bracknellforecasts this when she says to Cecily, “Pretty child! your dress is sadlysimple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it. But we can soonalter all that. A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a reallymarvellous result in a very brief space of time.” French maids, ambassadors fromBaudelaire’s Paris, are naughty necromancers turning nature into art.Cecily is no naive ingénue. In fact, her romantic behavior is even more perversethan Gwendolen’s. Reversing the habit of love stories, Wilde gives his women arhetoric more “experienced” than their male suitors’. For example, Gwendolen,with Decadent erudition, dismisses as “metaphysical speculation” Jack’splaintive question about whether she would continue to love him if his nameturned out not to be Ernest. She later remarks, “The simplicity of yourcharacter makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to me.” Woman is complex, mansimple. Even when Gwendolen says “I adore you,” there is a glacial tinge ofsatiric self-dramatization. Earnest’s maiden androgynes have a strangeprecocity, a way of surprising the conversation from unexpected angles anddefeating the wits of their suitors. The men love and are loved, but they aredealt with by the women, who predict their every move. The women dictate thestructure and pace of relationship. The men think they act on their own, butthey are always preceded and foreseen, not by a daemonic vampire of thecontinental Decadence but by the pert English girl of literary tradition. Thewomen are eager to marry—probably in order to dominate! In marriage, as definedby Lady Bracknell, the male is recessive. Gwendolen says of her cowed father,“The home seems to me to be the proper sphere for the man.”One of the remarkable things in Earnest is its female anticipation of malevolition. Nothing the men do surprises the women, because the latter survey theplay from a mount of Delphic omniscience. That Wilde assigns Cecily the moreeffeminate fiancé suggests something sexually problematic in her. Jaded Algernonis infuriatingly smug—until he meets Cecily. She immediately takes theoffensive, turning his greeting against him and seizing control of theconversation. Despite her innocent appearance, virtue is not what she seeks in asuitor. If Algernon is not “wicked,” as advertised, he is useless. The proposalscene is an astonishing performance. Although they have just met, Cecily claimsshe and Algernon have been engaged for months. He stands dazed, as she unveils along saga of courtship, alienation, and reconciliation, recorded in diary andletter. Algernon protests, “My letters! But, my own sweet Cecily, I have neverwritten you any letters.” She replies, “You need hardly remind me of that,Ernest. I remember only too well that I was forced to write your letters foryou. I wrote always three times a week, and sometimes oftener.” Cecily hasimagined Algernon before he has had any opportunity to act on his own. LikePoe’s William Wilson, he meets his other self, a doppelgánger projected byCecily. She creates a past for him, a prefabricated set of memories. He is aspassive as the waxy Hermaphrodite of Shelley’s Witch of Atlas, another cleverrural recluse. Algernon is half-delighted, half-horrified. The game swaysdizzily back and forth from illusion to reality. The episode is a development ofRosalind’s wooing scene with the tutored Orlando, where a suitor is enveloped inthe imagination of a female androgyne. In both cases, romantic union is plottedin advance by an ingenious virgin dramatist. Wilson Knight warns, “We regularlylet ourselves be born from a woman of whom we know nothing.”47[ch25_notes.html#ch21note47a] Algernon, in a condition of masculine nescience,lets himself become engaged to a woman of whom he knows nothing. Thus Cecily’switty manipulation of her suitor is more invasive of male autonomy thanGwendolen and Lady Bracknell’s bossier maneuvers.The wonderful airiness of The Importance of Being Earnest comes from the way itdiverts potentially sinister sexual relations into comedy. Mating isaccomplished with dreamlike ease. Chthonian danger and murk are transmuted intoglittering Apollonian words and gestures. I call woman “the hidden.” Wilde’sepicene formalism and visionary materialism bring everything hidden and internalinto dazzling visibility. Sexual turbulence never disturbs the play’s smooth,urbane surface. And yet it is a drama of Blake’s rapacious “female will.” BothGwendolen and Cecily want to marry a man named Ernest: men are to be earnest,where women are not. Wilde says, “In all important matters, style, notsincerity, is the essential.” And elsewhere: “What people call insincerity issimply a method by which we can multiply our personalities.”48[ch25_notes.html#ch21note48a] By forcing their suitors to be earnest or sincere,the women psychodramatically circumscribe them. In other words, they bind themen by ritual limitations prior to marriage. The women, meanwhile, parade theirown lack of earnestness, as in the tea-table scene, where they sabotage andreverse field on each other with blithe indifference to truth or logic.Why do the men dash off to be rechristened “Ernest”? They abandon theiridentities and undertake a Romantic regression to be born again in the image offemale desire. The women profess admiring astonishment: “For my sake you areprepared to do this terrible thing?” “To please me you are ready to face thisfearful ordeal?” Christening, a passive, unrisky event, becomes a harrowing ritede passage. The play parodies literary conventions: for example, Jack, like thearchetypal hero, has a mysterious birth—in a railway station. As in The Rape ofthe Lock, comedy is produced by a diminution of the scale of epic conflict. Atthe peak of hostilities, Gwendolen solemnly informs Cecily, “You have filled mytea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most distinctly for bread andbutter, you have given me cake.” This line (perfectly, mournfully read by JoanGreenwood) imitates outbursts from poetic drama like, “You befoul God and nationby your wanton, heinous act!” But in psychological terms, Gwendolen and Cecily’spleasure in the men’s will-to-christen translates to, “For me you are willing torevert to infancy?” The women are Procrustean linguists, chopping their suitors’identities and lifelines. The play’s reconciliation between the sexes istherefore much more complicated than it seems. The male “self-sacrifice”(Gwendolen’s word) making it possible is induced by female coercion, nascentmaternal tyranny. Earnest’s great achievement is that none of these emotionalambivalences is felt by the audience, so beautifully has the sexual anxiety beenredirected and absorbed. But our exhilaration at the finale comes partly fromour subliminal sense of many dangers present that have not been allowed todevelop. Wilde’s epicene wit keeps female chthonian power in check by turningall four principals into the glass-bodied androgyne of manners, who escapes andtranscends physiology.The Importance of Being Earnest is a ritual purification of Wilde’s earlierworks, Dorian Gray and Salomé. It dispels the anxiety of two criticalrelationships, each a Romantic marriage of sexual personae. The first is betweena man and his double. In Dorian Gray, the portrait-double is victorious,regaining eternal beauty by killing its human model. In Earnest, John Worthingcreates a double identity for himself: he is Jack in the country but a fictiveErnest in the city. His friend Algernon assumes this false self to invade thecountry house as Ernest Worthing. At that moment, Jack, dressed in black,arrives to announce the death of his brother Ernest. Jack is shocked to learnthat, far from being dead, the nonexistent Ernest is sitting in the dining room.As in Dorian Gray, the double has come to unpleasant life, escaped from itsmaster’s control. Since Earnest is a comedy, the double cannot exert thedaemonic oppression it has in Wilde’s novel. Jack is furious with vexation, buthe is not terrified. This is one of those moments where we see Wilde using theApollonian epicene to neutralize his literary antecedents. Here he dischargesthe unstable occultism from the Romantic theme of the double. Earnest ends withthat coalescence of the doubles I identify as a master motif of Romanticism. Inthe play’s last moments, Jack, to his astonishment, turns out to be named Ernestafter all. Thus he fuses with his alter ego. Furthermore, Algernon turns out tobe his long-lost brother. That is, the person who poses as an invented brotherbecomes that brother. The coalescence of the doubles on the last page of DorianGray means leprous contamination and death. But Earnest ends in fraternalconcord and joy. Wilde takes the negativity out of the ominous Romantic theme ofthe shadowy second self by switching genres into comedy, with its classical andRenaissance tradition of the missing twin.The second relationship Earnest purifies is between man and chthonian woman.This is the subject of Salomé (1893), which capsulizes the French Decadenttradition of the femme fatale. Wilde wrote it in French, the language ofDecadent prestige. Its uneven translation is by Lord Alfred Douglas. Fifty yearslater, another alienated Irishman was to use French for his best play, Waitingfor Godot. Salomé contains Wilde’s only chthonian woman. French is his strategyof linguistic distancing, laying an impassable moat or English Channel betweenthe homosexual aesthete and the femme fatale. For the idealizing Wilde, thechthonian is literally an alien realm. He consigns Salomé to French to keep hisnative tongue in a state of Apollonian purity. Its translation by his lover istherefore an ephebic rerouting of the text, a decontamination of its femaledangers.Salomé sounds better in French, since English prose, as shown by the painfulfailure of Woolf’s The Waves, cannot sustain an incantatory style. Salomé isfull of hieratic repetitions and theatrical Decadent excesses. For example,Salomé and Jokanaan (John the Baptist) are deep in tense conversation, when theyoung Syrian infatuated with her suddenly kills himself and falls between them.Neither one takes the slightest notice of this unusual interruption, which islike a sack of laundry flung down on the floor. Salomé inevitably turned itselfinto an opera, under the hand of Richard Strauss (1905). I said Gwendolen’sepicene language is not so much communication as hierarchic self-sequestration.Similarly, speech in Salomé is self-directed and self-hypnotizing. Thecharacters are catatonic somnambules, virtually every one an androgyne of myandroid type. Words are subordinated to seeing, along harsh planes ofeye-contact or eye-evasion. Wilde brings to an obsessive extreme the Decadenteroticization of visual experience begun by Gautier. Salomé stares at John,while Herod and the Syrian stare at her. Sex hovers in a static, sterile trancestate. Salomé is a Late Romantic vampire, fixing John with her aggressiveMedusa-eye and driving him into the terminal passivity of death. Wilde wrote ata time when respectable ladies avoided too “free” an eye, the mark of a whore—arule of moral deportment missing from today’s sloppy films on premodern times.Huysmans makes Salomé “woman virginal and lubricious,” thinking everything butdoing nothing. Ortega y Gasset says, “Salomé fantasizes in a masculinemanner.”49 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note49a] Cecily Cardew, I submit, is Wilde’srevision of his own fantasizing Salomé. Salomé and Cecily cast theirimaginations around a man, as Clytemnestra casts her net around Agamemnon. InSalomé as in Dorian Gray, a man sits for his portrait: John’s head is literallydrawn from life. Salomé creates a Decadent work of art: the severed head is maledestiny sculpted by the female will. Wilde’s incredible stage direction: “A hugeblack arm, the arm of the Executioner, comes forth from the cistern, bearing ona silver shield the head of Jokanaan.”50 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note50a] Thisgrotesque erection—the only erection possible in a Decadent work—may be a memoryof Baudelaire’s black tree of nature, hoisting aloft the crucified poet. Saloméseizes the head and kisses and soliloquizes to it, like Hamlet in the graveyard.Like Rachilde’s Raoule, she makes love to the dead. Like Dorian Gray, she kissesher own portrait, a point captured by Beardsley in The Climax, where male andfemale seem Medusan mirror-images (fig. 47 [ch21.html#ch21fig47]). In TheDancer’s Reward, Beardsley turns head and shield on black arm into macabresculpture on a pedestal. Unfortunately, his Salomé, fondling the saint’s longhair, looks a bit like a cook trussing the dinner roast.Image [../images/f0564-01.jpg]47. Aubrey Beardsley, The Climax, from Salomé, 1894.At the end, the femme fatale is apparently defeated, crushed beneath the shieldsof the palace guard. I interpret this bizarre method of execution as a symbol ofSalomé’s loss of perceptual control. She is buried beneath the multipliedobjects of the material world. This was the obscure fear of Gautier’ssuffocating Cleopatra, which I think Wilde adapts. But the vampire has athousand lives and is not so easily mastered. In Earnest, Wilde tries again andthis time succeeds. Like Salomé, Earnest deals with the theme of femaledominance. As an apotropaic construction, it absorbs the sexual anxietyexpressed but not resolved in Salomé. Earnest purifies woman of her chthoniantaint by turning her into the crystalline androgyne of manners. Now woman’svampire-command of the plane of eye-contact is an instrument not of sexualobsession and enslavement but of pursuit of the chic. Wilde’s female hierarchsrule the salon of Apollonian sunlight, not the dark womb-world of objectswithout contour.Mythologically, says Frye, comedy moves toward “the rebirth and renewal of thepowers of nature.”51 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note51a] The Importance of BeingEarnest is the least natural comedy in major literature. Its primary inspirationis Decadent hostility to nature. Drama is a mode of Dionysian vocalism, whileApollonian works are characterized by silence and visual clarity. Earnest, withits Apollonian formality and delimited language, is an attempt to cut off theDionysian roots of drama and create an Apollonian theater, as coldly outlined asan objet d’art. The play is the last skirmish in the Late Romantic campaignagainst nature. In The Decay of Lying, Wilde asks: “For what is Nature? Natureis no great mother who has borne us. She is our creation. It is in our brainthat she quickens to life.” Wilde’s nature is like Aeschylus’ Athena, born of amale god. Taking Baudelaire’s tone, Wilde declares, “Art is our spiritedprotest, our gallant attempt to teach Nature her proper place.”52[ch25_notes.html#ch21note52a] But Baudelaire’s nature is still chthonian, in allher cruelty and barbarism. Wilde, trying to remove the chthonianism from nature,trivializes her, an error for which he will later suffer.Baudelaire, thanks to Sade, is ultimately writing against Rousseau. Wilde,battling Victorian culture, is ultimately writing against Rousseau’s disciple,Wordsworth. My theory is this: Coleridge is the only way to defeat Wordsworth.The Apollonian Wilde, unable to take Coleridge’s daemonic view of nature, losesto Wordsworth and, amazingly, flips back into him. At the end of his career,Wilde becomes Wordsworth, just as Dorian Gray becomes Lord Henry Wotton. One ofWilde’s anti-Wordsworthian precepts: “The first duty in life is to be asartificial as possible.” He rejects Wordsworth’s analogy between imagination andnature: the only “function of Art” is to awaken “exquisite sterile emotions.”His spokesman in The Decay of Lying refuses to lie on the grass and talk: “ButNature is so uncomfortable. Grass is hard and lumpy and damp, and full ofdreadful black insects.”53 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note53a] This riposte, denyingman can be at ease in nature, is very amusing—until one recalls that Baudelairecreated a great work of art on this theme, “A Carcass,” where inhospitablenature teems with maggots. Wilde seems to be fighting for imagination’s freedom,but his flippant remarks about nature underestimate her power. I think at thisperiod he was going to too many chic parties, a practice fatal to seriouswriting. Fellini’s La Dolce Vita (1959) ends with a spent troop of decadentpartygoers straggling out onto a bleak beach at dawn. There they see, marooned,a monstrosity of primeval nature, the apparition of what they have repressed andtherefore become.Taken in its own terms, Wilde’s wicked satire of Wordsworth can be delicious.Wilde is, of course, indifferent to the sublime: Niagara Falls is “simply a vastunnecessary amount of water going the wrong way and then falling overunnecessary rocks.” He said of the Mississippi in angry flood, “No well-behavedriver ought to act that way.” He is invoking Apollonian principles: nature hasboth no form and bad form. My highschool favorite of the epigrams: “People whocount their chickens before they are hatched act very wisely: because chickensrun about so absurdly that it is almost impossible to count them accurately.”54[ch25_notes.html#ch21note54a] Wilde’s frantic chickens are Wordsworth’sdaffodils, “Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.” Nature’s vital energy hasbecome silly tumult. The uncountable chickens are a Maenadic band surveyed andscorned by an Apollonian spectator, peering through his dandy’s monocle. Arethese chickens woman as brooder/breeder? Wilde sees nature as mindlessproletarian sprawl.Earnest is full of jabs against Wordsworth. Lady Bracknell asks, “You have atown house, I hope? A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen,could hardly be expected to reside in the country.” Gwendolen, glancing at thegarden, remarks, “I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.” ForWilde, the city is the center of value. He said in conversation, “Town lifenourishes and perfects all the more civilized elements in man.” And: “Agentleman never looks out of the window.”55 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note55a] When,pressed by his producer, Wilde hastily cut Earnest down to three acts, he madeseveral regrettable changes of venue. The tea-table scene was originally in thedrawing room, not the garden. The drawing room, its proper place, is theeighteenth-century salon of the androgyne of manners. The revisions alsodestroyed one of the most sardonic stage directions in English drama. The play’swar between the sexes originally began with the women’s decampment: “They retireinto the garden with scornful looks.”56 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note56a] Thisbrilliant line extends Wilde’s antinaturism past his immediate target,Wordsworth, to take in the whole of English poetry, going back to the maidensand gardens of Spenser, Donne, and Marvell. Spenser’s two fair sister-nymphsstamp off with furrowed brow into a suddenly less idyllic mead. The stagedirection now reads, “They retire into the house with scornful looks”—from whichthere has been a tremendous loss of reference.The High Romantic revolt against neoclassicism comes full circle in the LateRomantic Wilde. Like the neoclassics, he exalts society over raw nature,aristocracy over democracy, artificiality over simplicity, wit over emotion,Apollonian limitation over Dionysian limitlessness. Wilde confirms Rousseau’sand Wordsworth’s belief that following nature makes man tender and benevolent:swerving from High Romantic nature, Wilde becomes cruel. He insults theVictorian taste for pathos, as when he says of a Dickens tear-jerker, “One musthave a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing.” LikeSade and Freud, Wilde sees altruism as covert egotism. Lord Henry Wotton says,“I can sympathize with everything, except suffering,” and “Philanthropic peoplelose all sense of humanity. It is their distinguishing characteristic.” Wilde’sprimary principle is aesthetic perfection of persona, beyond morality. LordHenry tells Dorian, “To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self. Discord isto be forced to be in harmony with others.” At his trial Wilde said, “I thinkthat the realization of oneself is the prime aim of life.” He echoes Lord Henry:“The aim of life is self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that iswhat each of us is here for.”57 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note57a] This is the paganvoice of the Hellenophile Wilde. Complete self-realization: was this not soughtby Nero? Attila the Hun? Hitler? Late Romanticism’s extremism remainsuncomfortably avant-garde.Wilde was incapable of sympathy or collective emotion because of his Apollonianopposition to the Dionysian, the mode of the “Many” and of what I call theempathic. In his fall, his Apollonian system was overturned and demolished. Itall began with a self-deceiving literalization. Earnest’s glittering great chainof being is a visionary construction and not the actual social world of law,finance, or aristocracy. Wilde knew this. But intoxicated by his supremeartistic success, which had brought Dorian Gray into being as Lord AlfredDouglas, he sought to turn institutional power to his own selfish ends. Enragedagainst Queensberry, Wilde stepped over the line from fiction into reality, fromwhich he never returned:The one disgraceful, unpardonable, and to all time contemptible action of mylife was my allowing myself to be forced into appealing to Society for help andprotection. … Of course once I had put into motion the forces of Society,Society turned on me and said, “Have you been living all this time in defianceof my laws, and do you now appeal to those laws for protection? You shall havethose laws exercised to the full. You shall abide by what you have appealed to.”The result is I am in gaol.58 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note58a]The daemon hubristically conjured up by an Apollonian Late Romantic is societyitself, a genie that will not go back into its bottle.Crushed by conviction and imprisonment, Wilde undergoes a revolution ofprinciples. De Profundis contains one of the most extraordinary recantations inthe history of art. The pitiless sophisticate now embraces suffering as thehighest human experience:I used to live entirely for pleasure. I shunned sorrow and suffering of everykind. I hated both. I resolved to ignore them as far as possible, to treat them,that is to say, as modes of imperfection. They were not part of my scheme oflife. They had no place in my philosophy.His mother often quoted Goethe’s lines about weeping through “the midnighthours”: “I absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth hidden inthem. I could not understand it.” But a year of weeping in prison has changedhis mind:Clergymen, and people who use phrases without wisdom, sometimes talk ofsuffering as a mystery. It is really a revelation. One discerns things that onenever discerned before. One approaches the whole of history from a differentstandpoint. … I now see that sorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man iscapable, is at once the type and test of all great Art.59[ch25_notes.html#ch21note59a]Maternal woman was central to the nature cult of Dionysus, who wears her robesand snood in art. The ephebic male was the model for the Apollonian Olympians,whose obliviousness to emotion is explicit in De Profundis: Wilde speaks of thecruelty of Apollo and Athena, with the “steel shields” of her pitiless eyes.60[ch25_notes.html#ch21note60a]In prison, the amoral worshipper of beauty passes from Apollonian cruelty, atits height in his ephebic Dorian Gray, to Dionysian empathy, province of themature heterosexual woman, his own potent mother. Woman is internality, bothprocreative and emotional. De Profundis (“from the depths”) was written in tearsand at the midnight hour, not in Apollonian sunlight. It descends into themurky, fluid female world of brooding invisibility, which Earnest combats. TheDecay of Lying denies nature’s priority: “Nature is no great mother who hasborne us.” But De Profundis declares, “The Earth is mother to us all.” By thebitterest of ironies, the Apollonian Wilde was thrown back into the arms ofmaternal nature. His words at the end of De Profundis echo Swinburne’s ode tothe ocean-mother: “I have a strange longing for the great simple primevalthings, such as the Sea, to me no less of a mother than the Earth. It seems tome that we all look at Nature too much, and live with her too little. … I feelsure that in elemental forces there is purification, and I want to go back tothem and live in their presence.”61 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note61a] Wilde’sDecadent biography fulfilled Huysmans’ prophetic pattern: the man warringagainst mother nature suffers ignominious defeat and must surrender himself toher for healing and detoxification.Like Swinburne’s poetry, De Profundis charts a regression to prehistoricmatriarchy, before the invention of male society and even before the birth ofobjects. Readers have missed the primitivizing impulse in it because it containsso much distracting talk of Christ. The Christian references mean no more thanthey do in Coleridge’s mystery poems: Christ is the ultimate male heroine, thepassive public sufferer. Wilde depicts “the crucifixion of the Innocent Onebefore the eyes of his mother and of the disciple whom he loved.”62[ch25_notes.html#ch21note62a] We are meant to see Wilde pilloried—and at thefoot of the cross, the uneasy duo of Lady Wilde and Douglas. The longdisquisition on Christ is lugubrious and self-indulgent. But as in The AncientMariner, self-pity is the Romantic male heroine’s mesmerizing litany and modusoperandi.Wilde’s new idea that sorrow is “the supreme emotion” and “the type and test ofall great Art” merges Hellenistic emotionalism with Victorian pathos. Despitethe cynicism of his epigrams, he was always vulnerable to sentimentality. Hehimself saw a connection between the two: “Remember that the sentimentalist isalways a cynic at heart. Indeed sentimentality is merely the bank holiday ofcynicism.” Wilde’s weakness is embarrassingly obvious in Dorian Gray’s dreadfulSibyl Vane episode and in his plays’ melodramatic treatment of unlucky women.Reviewing his career in De Profundis, he grossly overestimates hisaccomplishments in drama and poetry: “Whatever I touched I made beautiful in anew mode of beauty.”63 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note63a] But it is just when hetries to be “beautiful” that he is most sentimental. Although he made a greatshow of being a poet, not one of his tepid poems would have preserved his namebeyond his lifetime. The “poetic” passages in his essays, compared to parallelmoments in Baudelaire, are watery and bathetic. Dorian Gray’s catalogue ofpriceless objets d’art is borrowed from Huysmans and written in an English notnearly so fine as Robert Baldick’s superb translation of A Rebours. UnlikeGautier, Wilde had few powers of luxurious or lyric description. His efforts tobe beautiful seem puerile or, more precisely, girlish.Though Wilde was Wordsworth’s most merciless antagonist, the two possessedvirtually identical creative psychologies. The principal danger to imaginationin both Wilde and Wordsworth arose from an uncontrolled feminine element ofsentimental pathos. The weak in Wilde’s writing, everywhere intermingled withthe strong, is the result of an emergence or disinterment of this femininepersona, which is born, as in Wordsworth, from complexities of identificationwith a mater dolorosa. This may have contributed to Wilde’s downfall. Aside fromthe misjudgment of his libel suit, he had ample opportunity to leave the countrybetween his first and second trials. As Ellmann says, “He enticed the age tocrucify him, and of course it was as acquiescent in such matters as otherages.”64 [ch25_notes.html#ch21note64a] His reluctance to flee was part of hispublic ritual of abasement of the will. In Wilde and Wordsworth, men must behermaphroditized by disaster.Wilde had developed his personality to so high a degree of tension that all ofnature and culture pressed intolerably on the bounds of self. High comicrepartee is sometimes called “brittle,” suggesting its glittering, crystallinecharacter. The brittleness of worldly wit comes from its tightness andnarrowness, its willful condensation and contraction. It may break from what isexcluded. Wilde’s epicene epigrams belong to the Botticellian tradition of theincised edge, used for the same purpose by Spenser and Blake. His Apolloniandelimitations are attempts to separate language from archetypal nature.Aestheticism is predicated on nature’s exclusion. But Wilde was undone by hissimplistic view of nature, whose chthonian ferocity he never imaginativelygrasped. The repulsiveness of procreative nature is the crucial first principleof Decadent beauty. The gorgeous lapidary surfaces of Moreau and Huysmans, theexquisite scintillations of imagery in late Gautier and Baudelaire were madepossible by the hostile power these artists saw in nature. Nature’s formlessnessand liquidity energize the aesthetic reaction, producing a rigorous art ofcrystalline hardness. Wilde, by blinding himself to the chthonian, severedhimself from the primal sources of Decadent beauty. Thus his poetry andprose-poems are weak and inconsequential.The reason Wilde did his best work after turning homosexual is that women simplyreinforced his own feminine sentimentality. He had no gift for lyric, sincelyric is based on simple, “natural” emotion. Wilde’s writing must behierarchical in order to be beautiful. He has to kill emotion with Apolloniancruelty. Heterosexuality inhibited his imagination because woman is physicallyand psychologically internal. Wilde says, following Gautier: “To the aesthetictemperament the vague is always repellent. The Greeks were a nation of artists,because they were spared the sense of the infinite.”65[ch25_notes.html#ch21note65a] For the infinite, substitute the invisible, thatdark realm of the female body toward which Hellenistic art turns, parallelingthe inward movement of Greek philosophy. Wilde’s conversion to the homosexualworship of beauty provided him with the master image of the articulated malebody, with its radical sexual externality. The beautiful boy, because of hislack of an inner life, became Wilde’s emancipator of imagination.In The Importance of Being Earnest, the failed poet created a magnificent newpoetry, one that even he did not recognize. Wilde’s play, after Spenser’s FaerieQueene and Shelley’s Epipsychidion, is the most dazzling burst of Apollonianpoetry in English literature. It was made possible by a hermaphroditictransformation, the strangest I have ever studied. The desirable male body wasefficacious for Wilde by its fixing of visible limits. Ordinarily, the epiceneis synonymous with effeminacy. But the epicene made Wilde more masculine bygiving him the aggressive power of Apollonian delimitation, which I foundeverywhere in the language, manners, and aristocratic social order of TheImportance of Being Earnest. The epicene gave Wilde the discipline of conceptualform that he most lacked as a sentimental lyricist. When, through his ownself-thwartings, he was forced by tomblike imprisonment to abandon the amoralGreek worship of the visible world, his sentimentality returned, flooding backinto the empathic De Profundis and bringing woman with it."},{"pageContent":"22AMERICAN DECADENTSPoe, Hawthorne, MelvilleIn America, English Romanticism fuses with a debilitated Puritanism. AmericanRomanticism is really Decadent Late Romanticism, a style of sexual perversity,closure, and fragmentation or decay. Poe, Coleridge’s heir, shows Wordsworthiannature as a dead end. His Gothic entombments shut down the American frontier andrepeal the ideal of progress. Poe moves Romanticism into its Mannerist latephase. From 1830 on, American and French Romanticism develop on parallel tracks.French Decadence, we saw, was hastened along by Coleridge coming through Byronto Delacroix, Balzac, and Gautier and by Coleridge coming through Poe toBaudelaire. Now we will examine sexual ambiguities and obsessions that criticshave ignored or minimized in major American writers. Decadent Late Romanticismwas America’s first internal critique of its optimistic overidealizations, abequest of the Apollonian Enlightenment.Classic American literature suffers from a sex problem. Genitality is evaded, orwoman is excluded to facilitate what Leslie Fiedler calls “the holy marriage ofmales.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note1a] America’s origins in sectarianProtestantism produced a circumscription of personae like that of republicanRome. Puritan personality, unitary and sharply bounded, was formed by the“rectitude” of acts, a masculine straightmeasure. Hawthorne shows patriarchalwill waning in The House of the Seven Gables, with its decadent relics of shabbymansion and inherited curse.America’s sex problem began with the banishment of the maternal principle fromProtestant cosmology. Medieval Mariolatry was and is a pagan survival thatProtestantism, faithful to early Christianity, correctly opposes. But theabsence of the mother from pioneer American values imaginatively limited apeople living intimately with nature. A society enamored of the future sweepsaway the mother, because she is the past, the state of remaining. As I said ofByronism, America is a land of transients and transience, of movement to andacross. In its Enlightenment self-fabrication, America rejected the archaic,leaving a symbolic vacuum partly filled by Indian and Negro. EnglishRomanticism, a neo-pagan cult of the sexual archetypal, arrived as a secondrevolution, daemonizing American literature. The first artist to register thisfully is Poe, who introduces the numinous woman to America. His best tales areredramatizations of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner and Christabel, which wasinspired by Spenser’s Faerie Queene. So what we will be tracing in the AmericanDecadents is the action-at-a-distance of Italian Renaissance paganism, a styleexploited by Emily Dickinson in her wanton Catholic corruptions of her family’sNew England Protestantism.Poe’s tales are Romantic rather than Gothic, because of the intenseidentification between himself and his narrators. His women have many names, butthere is only one narrator, one voice. Poe’s persona or Magister Ludi is theRomantic male heroine of passive suffering. His major women, Berenice, Ligeia,and Morella, tall, beautiful, and strangely erudite, are all versions ofColeridge’s vampire Geraldine, who comes to fainting Christabel out of thenight. But there is no sexual metathesis and hence no lesbian fantasy. UnlikeColeridge, Balzac, Baudelaire, and Swinburne, Poe keeps his heroes to their owngender. He demands overt male subjection to female power. His women arehermaphrodite divinities, multiple faces of the black Venus. Huysmans, withFrench intuition, calls Poe’s women “unsexed”: they have “the inert, boyishbreasts of angels.”2 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note2a]There is no sex instinct per se in Poe. His eroticism is in the paroxysms ofsuffering, the ecstatic, self-inflaming surrender to tyrant mothers. Thenarrator of Ligeia is a “child” beneath the tutelage and “infinite supremacy” ofthe heroine (named, I presume, after a Homeric Siren in Milton). Like Shelleyand Mill, Poe dreams of male eclipse by a Muse-like female mind. Ligeiamysteriously lacks a “paternal name,” because woman is parthenogenetic,conceived and conceiving without male aid.3 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note3a] Thenarrator cannot remember when or where he met her: she is the mother-shadow atthe door of infant memory.The sexual laws of Poe’s world are so strict that a normal, feminine womancannot survive in it. The narrator’s second wife, blonde Lady Rowena, must beexterminated to restore the proper hierarchy of female over male. Raven-hairedLigeia, overcoming death by brute willpower, returns from the grave to invadethe body of her successor. I say Poe is rewriting Geraldine’s rape ofChristabel. He turns Coleridge’s ritual scene back toward heterosexuality, as hedoes again in Morella, where a dead woman returns to obliterate her daughter.Ligeia ends in daemonic epiphany, a “hideous drama of revivification,” as thenarrator shrieks with joy and fear. There is a horrible burst of “huge masses oflong and dishevelled hair … blacker than the wings of the midnight”4[ch25_notes.html#ch22note4a] Ligeia is mother nature and archaic night, aneruption of the pagan chthonian. She defies God’s law of mortality because she,not he, is the resurrection and the life. Through the cataract of Medusan hairslowly open, robotlike, Ligeia’s “cold, dead eyes”—the eyes by which Geraldinehypnotizes Christabel. What happens next? The story self-destructs. Poe’snarrator is turned to stone by the Gorgon eye of nature, vomiting its coarsetangle of serpent-growth from the black soil.In Berenice (1835), written three years earlier, the sudden hierarchic assertionoccurs at the start rather than end of the psychodrama. Incest again: Bereniceand the narrator are cousins. She dominates him with her catatonic “glassystare.” He anxiously studies her “thin and shrunken lips,” which part in astrange smile to reveal “the teeth.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note5a] Coleridge’svampire bares her fangs. The vagina dentata, which sucks in Huysmans’ hero, is akind of beacon in Poe: his vampire Muse guides, leads, eats. Face to face withnature, Poe sees not Wordsworth’s benevolent mother but Darwin’s cannibal, theMistress of the Beasts. Berenice is literally long in the tooth, older thantime. Poe’s vampire tales are religious literature, like Donne’s Holy Sonnets.They confront ultimate realities, shocking and unconsoling.Berenice’s teeth are an example of Decadent partition. Like Gautier’s mummy’sfoot, they secede from the whole and greedily swell, with power. They invade andrape what the narrator calls “the disordered chamber of my brain,” modelled onthe vaginal skull of Keats’s Apollo.The teeth!—the teeth!—they were here, and there, and every where, and visiblyand palpably before me; long, narrow, and excessively white, with the pale lipswrithing about them. … In the multiplied objects of the external world I had nothoughts but for the teeth…. They—they alone were present to the mental eye, andthey, in their sole individuality, became the essence of my mental life.6[ch25_notes.html#ch22note6a]Here, there, and everywhere: Berenice has gotten her teeth from Coleridge’sred-lipped Nightmare Life-in-Death, scudding along on water, water everywhere,poison to body and mind. Poe’s narrator is crucified on the phallic teeth, whichdoom him to Decadent fixation and contraction. The teeth absorb hisconsciousness, condensing the universe to one totemic symbol. A task of the LateRomantic artist, I said, is to order the excess of phenomena pressing at theclose of High Romanticism. Hence the narrator’s fixation on the teethparadoxically frees him from enslavement to “the multiplied objects of theexternal world.” Late Romantic sexual obsession is a metaphysical strategy, aformula of perceptual control. Poe and Gautier simultaneously develop ritualizedeye-object relations out of the collapse of High Romanticism. Berenice’s teethattract and secure the imagination, reducing the world to tolerable proportions.When she dies or seems to die, the narrator pursues her to the grave and tearsout her teeth, which he fetishistically preserves like saints’ relics or magictalismans. The teeth are now his guardians of identity. Berenice’s “dentalsurgery” is like Kleist’s mastectomies: mutilation and reduction of the body area ritual ascesis of overexpanded modern imagination.The story’s climax, the surgical assault on Berenice’s body, is a perverse sexact, like the knife-rape of Balzac’s girl with the golden eyes (written the sameyear). In Poe, woman can be sexually approached only if dead. Person becomesobject, in the Decadent manner. The narrator farms and harvests Berenice, as ifshe were an oyster and her teeth pearls. Sexual desire is diverted from animalflesh toward calcified mineral deposits, those antique enamels we carry in ourmouth. The narrator can act only in a trance of self-removal. He is passive tohis own extreme emotion, from which he is further separated by a memory lapse.Action is compulsive. The narrator would probably insist, with justice, that heis under criminal compulsion by Berenice herself, who lures him into barbarismby her chthonian force. Love leads to sadism. The Hellenistic Berenice was anEgyptian queen from whom a lock of hair was shorn. Poe’s hermaphrodite Berenice,stripped of her “sentient” teeth, is symbolically castrated. But she stilllives. The vampire of nature will not stay in her grave. In Poe, sex is ritualcombat, a hundred engagements with one outcome: female victory.Poe, following Coleridge, is always revising Wordsworth. His most spectacularColeridgean nature-saga is A Descent into the Maelström (1841), with itshurricane and whirlpool. The male is sucked into nature’s maw, a titanic funnelwith “an appalling voice, half shriek, half roar,” a bisexual clamor.7[ch25_notes.html#ch22note7a] He spirals down to its nadir, the zero or ninthcircle of a female inferno, the nothingness of primeval origins. Sinking, hesurveys “the wide waste of liquid ebony,” a stunning phrase that combinesnature’s vast desolation with its flux of dark liquidity. In one day, thesailor’s hair turns white. To tell his tale, like Coleridge’s Mariner, he climbsthe highest peak. Like Moses, he has seen God. But Moses descends from hisencounter with the sky-god, while Poe’s hero must ascend from the bowels of theearth-mother, who parts the waves of her own Red Sea. Maelström contains thecosmology of Poe’s vampire tales. Ligeia, Berenice, and Morella are nature’ssexual personae. Poe, like Sade, sets sex into the sinister continuum of savagenature.Nature speaks again at the finale of The Fall of the House of Usher (1839),where a mansion is swallowed up by the “black and lurid tarn,” another liquidebony: “There was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousandwaters.” This tarn, with its “pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish,… andleaden-hued,” is the primeval swamp of generation. Usher, like Gautier’ssimultaneous A Night with Cleopatra, is a maturely Decadent fiction, exuding anatmosphere of “extensive decay.”8 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note8a] History hasshrunk to an effete aesthete and his Byronic sister-double, sealed in acrumbling mansion covered with fungi. Nature creeps and crawls but will win witha bang. The story ends like Balzac’s Girl with the Golden Eyes in a panorama ofcivilization overwhelmed by the chthonian. The tarn is Poe’s maelstrom inhibernation. Its stagnant morass is mother nature’s mouth in fetid repose. Atthe violent climax, brother and sister fuse in a sadistic love-death, like thefiery cleaving of Euripides’ princess and father. Incest is Romantic regression.The cracked house of Usher, an Apollonian head fractured by madness, surrendersto the Dionysian, the murky womb-world of the primeval abyss.Palace, apocalypse: Poe repeats this Bacchae-like pattern in The Masque of theRed Death (1842), a masterpiece of amazing brevity. Prince Prospero tries todefy and shut out nature, which finally crushes him—a plot echoed by Huysmans.The donnée is from Boccaccio’s Decameron, where a party of Florentine gentryflee to the countryside to escape the Black Death. But Poe’s Red Death isbiology-as-pestilence, “the redness and the horror of blood.” Prosperoconstructs a temple of art, a corridor of lavish chambers of blue, purple,green, orange, white, and violet. The seventh chamber reveals thediscontinuities of Decadent aestheticism. It is the only one where the color oftapestries, carpet, and stained-glass windows fails to match: the fabrics areblack, but the glass is “scarlet—a deep blood color.”9[ch25_notes.html#ch22note9a] This chamber, where prince and spectre meet, is thewomb, light piercing the membrane in a ruddy stream. Masoch, probably imitatingPoe, adds a similar room to Venus in Furs: “a red streak, like blood,” lights up“a dark, dank, subterranean” cell, where the hero is cut free from umbilicalropes.10 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note10a] The ebony clock of Poe’s seventh chamberis the ominous heartbeat of the maternal body. Since the Red Death is lifeitself, the clock is the passing bell that tolls for every man.The Masque of the Red Death has two rhetorical peculiarities. First, itsprotagonist is masculine. Second, it is written in impersonal third-personnarration, rare in Poe. The two are one: as a male heroine, Poe, likeWordsworth, cannot project himself into a masculine persona. This is the mostapocalyptic of his tales, ending with the unforgettable sentence, “And Darknessand Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.” Maelström andUsher are less absolute, for at least the narrators escape to tell their tales(a device Melville borrows for the finale of Moby-Dick). But The Red Death endswith the annihilation of all humanity. Psychosexually, Prospero has producedthis through his own vaunting masculinity, for unlike Poe’s tremulousfirst-person narrators, he never subordinates himself to hierarchic femalepersonae, who are excluded from his mad revels. Hence the greater the show ofmasculinity in Poe, the more catastrophic the punishing reversal. The Red Death,the ghoulish vampire masquer, shadows Prospero as his bodiless, genderlessdouble, liquidating him in the black chamber. Scornfully vanishing into thinair, the Red Death is nature’s ungraspable mystery.Prospero’s seventh chamber has a whole story devoted to itself in The Pit andthe Pendulum, written the same year. The narrator is trapped in a strangelymobile room with “fiery walls,” closing upon him in spasms of contraction. Thisis a body-warmed womb-world: the floor is “moist and slippery,” “treacherouswith slime,” suggesting female secretions. The narrator is caught between acircular pit, a dank “abyss” like Lear’s female hell, and the razor-sharppendulum of time, to which men are condemned at birth. The story takes us into“the red walls” of the vagina dentata. It is as if we were in Berenice’s mouth,watching the portcullis of her teeth descending. Poe is obsessed with closure,from The Premature Burial to The Cask of Amontillado, with its murder bywalling-up. In Maelström, Charybdis to The Pit’s Scylla, he even converts theflat sea into a vacuum-vortex of female internality. Poe’s closed spaces arealways vaguely anatomical. They are literally living rooms. In Ligeia, forexample, mechanical wind behind the draperies gives the bridal chamber “ahideous and uneasy animation.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note11a] Architecture inThe Tell-Tale Heart is distinctly anthropomorphic, for in hiding the dismemberedbody beneath the floorboards, the guilty narrator seems to have devoured hiseye-intense father-victim, whose heart beats in him like that of a daemonicfetus.Characters are buried alive in Poe because he sees nature as a hostile womb fromwhich humanity can never be fully born. His master image is like the Mycenaeantholos, the subterranean beehive womb-tomb. His stories are Late Romantic tholoifusing the traumas of birth and death. His world suffers an interminable,festering pregnancy. The graveyard soil in which his imagination burrows is theHigh Romantic landscape, which, once vivified, almost immediately sank into theLate Romantic mass of decaying object-life. The “Many” of created nature, deftlyinspirited by Keats, lie in squalid heaps that Late Romanticism is too fatiguedto make intelligible. Hence Poe’s suffocation and claustrophobia. His narrator’svoice never changes because he is writing the same story over and over. Poepersonalizes the Gothic novel’s daemonic wombs by adding the Coleridgean “I AM.”Gothic atmosphere becomes psychology or rather psychopathology, stormy innerweather. Poe’s tales are developments of High Romantic lyric. They are shortstories rather than novels, because they are like the skeletal sexual scripts ofSade’s 120 Days of Sodom. Narrative detail is stripped away to reveal thehierarchic framework in cold clarity. Poe’s tales are pagan odes of invocation,realigning male imagination toward omnipotent female nature.Had he been French, Poe would have been, with Gautier, a founder ofaestheticism. He is full of aesthetic yearnings. But his attempts ataristocratic environments of objets d’art usually fizzle, due to the poverty ofAmerican culture in his day. There was nothing here to cultivate his taste, noEuropean galleries, mansions, cathedrals. Balzac, Gautier, and Baudelaire, onthe other hand, partied and promenaded with avant-garde painters. Talk about artfilled the air. Ligeia’s elaborate bridal chamber is to Poe what the ornateboudoir is to Balzac. But alas, Poe has tackily plopped “a gigantic sarcophagusof black granite” in each corner of the room. His gilded style of décor is likethat of William Randolph Hearst’s San Simeon, a muddle of priceless butincongruous objects. Similarly, Poe’s language is too often ho-hum journalese,peppered with bathos. Coleridge and Poe have cinematic minds. They are mastersof emotional extremity and archetypal visualization. But in his Baudelaireanquest for a theory of art, Poe was ill-served by his nation, with its lingeringPuritan hostility to beauty and pleasure.In the detective story, invented by Poe, the Apollonian male mind breaks free ofsex and nature. Only The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) is Decadent. There,nature again invades the inmost chamber, Poe’s temenos of archetypal encounter.But now nature is an ape in brutal masculine action, on the rampage againstfemale power. Woman, who binds us into materiality, is battered and mutilated toplug up the chimney hole or maelstrom through which she steals from men in orderto give birth.Poe’s essays are similarly sexualized. The Imp of the Perverse, prefiguringFreud’s theory of the unconscious, sees humanity as vulnerable to amoralimpulses. The vampire tales show the genesis of this idea, which is anotherversion of male passivity. In The Philosophy of Composition, Poe declares, “Thedeath of a beautiful woman is, unquestionably, the most poetical topic in theworld.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note12a] This looks like run-of-the-millnineteenth-century sentimentalism. But the glamourous Poe woman is not femininebut masculine. Hence the death of the masculine principle is poetical, becauseit unites male and female, aggression and passivity, appearance anddisappearance. In Poe as in Coleridge, poetry is a synthesis of contraries.The mother banished from Protestantism makes her American debut at the climax ofPoe’s The Narrative of A. Gordon Pym (1837). This novella, in a specially boundprivate edition, appears in A Rebours, exactly as a copy of A Rebours appears inDorian Gray. Pym is an archetypal journey to the heart of creation. Its hero,the transformed Poe (Pym = pseudonym), witnesses a tremendous return of therepressed, for which the price is death.As the polar sea around his drifting boat turns warm and “milky,” Pym goes numbwith “a dreaminess of sensation.” White ashy powder rains down, like the flakesof fire Dante compares to Alpine snow (Inf. XIV, 28–30). A huge cataractcurtained in vapor falls silently into the sea, lit by “a luminous glare.” Theboat rushes “into the embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself opento receive us.” A titan rises, skin white as snow. Here the story ends.13[ch25_notes.html#ch22note13a]Who or what is the apparition? Our reading must be imagistically consistent withPoe’s other tales. Pym meets the nature mother, into whom he is reabsorbed. Sheis shrouded, like Spenser’s Venus, because she is hermaphroditic. This is achthonian epiphany, muffled and eyeless. We enter the Dionysian realm offormlessness and dissolution. Poe borrows the chasm, “mighty fountain,”“lifeless ocean,” and “milk of Paradise” from “Kubla Khan” and joins them toEpipsychidion’s dream of prenatal incest. The white curtain over life’s mysteryparts, and the frail soul-boat plunges into the birth canal. At degree zero, aseminal torrent rushes eternally into the womb of matter. The smothering whiteshower is phenomena sinking back to primeval origins. White noise, white hole,the birth and death of stars: this spectacle of soundless sensory deprivation isa Romantic triumph. All hysteria resolves into oppressive calm.At almost the same moment, Nathaniel Hawthorne too was thinking of the goddessmother and her veils. The Minister’s Black Veil (1836) is a bizarre exercise intransvestism. The Reverend Mr. Hooper greets his congregation with his facehidden by “a simple black veil, such as any woman might wear on her bonnet.”People are perplexed or terrified. The minister stays in costume for the rest ofhis life. Assumption by critics that the veil is the burden of original sinunpersuasively imposes the moral and rational on the compulsive and uncanny.Hooper diagnoses the sexual incompleteness of Protestantism and remedies it byautomedication. He does not seek concrete sexual experience. On the contrary,his refusal to remove the veil drives away his fiancée, whose loss he acceptswith a coy smile. The gender-blurring veil is like the goddess’ robe donned bymale initiates of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Devotee merges with nature mother bytranssexual impersonation. The story acknowledges its pagan inspiration whenHooper, spooked by his veiled face in the mirror, rushes into the night: “TheEarth, too, had on her Black Veil.”14 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note14a] So theminister’s black veil is the female shadow of archaic night.Hawthorne’s tales ponder Christianity’s uneasy relation to woman and nature. InThe Birthmark, a scientist destroys his bride by trying to remove “the bloodyhand” imprinted by nature on her cheek. In Rappaccini’s Daughter, a sequesteredgirl is turned into a poison flower by her harsh father, an Apollonian Jehovahplaying dirty tricks in Eden. In The May-Pole of Merry Mount, Puritans squelch atown’s pagan revels in the woods. In The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne puts themother at center stage. The adulteress Hester Prynne, infant at her bosom, is“the image of Divine Maternity,” which only “a Papist among the crowd ofPuritans would recognize.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note15a] In other words,Hester is the Catholic Madonna drummed out of Protestantism. That the mothertheme of The Scarlet Letter had something to do with Hawthorne’s own mother isclear from the chronology of composition. After his mother’s death on 31 July1849, he fell ill from a “brain fever,” from which recovery was slow. There is agap in his notebooks from 30 July to 5 September, during which he began work onThe Scarlet Letter. The book was completed the next February and published thatyear.In “The Custom-House,” the semiautobiographical preface, Hawthorne introduceshis antagonist persona, a Puritan patriarch, “that first ancestor” of his familywho “still haunts me”: “this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked, and steeple-crownedprogenitor,—who came so early, with his Bible and his sword.”16[ch25_notes.html#ch22note16a] In The Scarlet Letter, the exiled sexual personaof the saintly natural mother will defeat Hawthorne’s despotic male progenitor,who carries a church on and in his head. Both preface and novella are twicetheir optimal length. The Scarlet Letter is overwritten. Its secretpreoccupation is embedded, hidden, layered with anxious afterthought. The storyis as obsessively embroidered as the red letter itself.Hawthorne’s tale of adultery is not like Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina, socialnovels. The Scarlet Letter is a Late Romantic dream poem, stirred by innerturbulence. Fiedler says “the carnal act” of adultery is “deprived of reality bybeing displaced in time” and is thus, “in the psychologist’s sense,prehistoric.”17 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note17a] There is a striking diversion ofaffect away from Hester toward a homoerotic male dominator, “misshapen” RogerChillingworth. Why did Hawthorne drag in this superfluous Mephisto character?Chillingworth’s presence is a psychological necessity. By binding him to thealleged adulterer Arthur Dimmesdale (they are together “sleeping and waking”),Hawthorne leaves Hester and her daughter Pearl in a “magic circle” or “circle ofseclusion,” an archetypal female temenos no man can enter.18[ch25_notes.html#ch22note18a] Old Chillingworth is the cold, paralyzing hand ofHawthorne’s father and forefathers. Hester is his divinized mother, half Virgin,half Magdalene. Adultery is the son’s jealous charge against a mother abandoninghim for his father. Hester is Antigone standing against the town, whileDimmesdale is Oedipus ruined by incest.Hester is a wandering goddess still bearing the mark of her Asiatic origins. Shehas “a rich, voluptuous, Oriental characteristic,—a taste for the gorgeouslybeautiful,” expressed in needlework. The scarlet letter, standing for adulterybut also for the Alpha and Omega of divinity, is adorned with “elaborateembroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread.” A Byzantine Madonna orRenaissance queen, Hester exposes the multiple repressions of Puritanism:beauty, sex, imagination, art. Hawthorne’s Gretchen has expanded in power, whileFaust has shrunk. Like the veiled minister, Dimmesdale is a man of God who seeksthe goddess. His virility is as dim as his name. With his breathless tremors and“childish weakness,” the “passive” Dimmesdale is a Romantic male heroine, moreson than lover. Even if one accepts the adultery as a given, the sex act haspermanently crippled the male, a drone stunned by the queen bee. Hester mustexhort Dimmesdale, “Preach! Write! Act!”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note19a] She hasenergy because she is Romantic nature, while Puritan patriarchy is in decadentdecline.The climax is Dimmesdale’s night ascent of the public platform of ritualexposure to stand with Hester and her daughter. As they hold hands, “atumultuous rush of new life,” “a torrent” of “vital warmth” pours through him:“The three formed an electric chain.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note20a] Theminister’s acceptance of moral responsibility?—worthless in my view if not inthe day. I see the scene as a tableau of matrilineage staged on the pagan altarof archaic night. The male joins himself to the electric chain of femaleness.Rejuvenated by a surge of female force, he declares, in effect, “I too am bornof woman!”As in The Minister’s Black Veil, a covert transsexualism is at work. In hisearly twenties, before secluding himself in his mother’s house for twelve years,Hawthorne added a w to the family name Hathorne. This w prefigures the scarletletter that, in “The Custom-House,” he tries to fix to his breast but drops onthe floor when he feels it burning with ghostly mana. “Hawthorne” is hisfather’s name blasphemously hermaphroditized. The w, I think, is for woman, whomHawthorne injects into his patrimony, just as he is to restore the mother to thePuritan seventeenth century in The Scarlet Letter. The Romantic idea of ahermaphroditic surname may have come to him from the fact that his mother’smaiden name was Manning.The hypnotic or somnambulistic liaison between the men of The Scarlet Letteranticipates the one between the women of The Blithedale Romance (1852). As Ishowed, Geraldine’s seduction of Christabel is Hawthorne’s model for the fieryZenobia’s mesmeric domination of feminine Priscilla. Henry James willredramatize The Blithedale Romance in The Bostonians, where Coleridge’s lesbiantheme boldly resurfaces. Coleridge and Hawthorne share a fascism of the eye.Criticism fails to notice that major nineteenth-century American literature hasas perverse a visual eroticism as anything in Decadent Paris. Hester, warningthe palpitating Dimmesdale of Chillingworth’s “evil eye,” tries to break thespell by “fixing her deep eyes on the minister’s, and instinctively exercising amagnetic power” over him.21 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note21a] In Romantic vampirism,ocular fascination accompanies monstrous soul-divisions. One gender may splitinto a warring pair, autoerotic and self-tormenting. Dimmesdale is tied toHester by guilt and dependency but not by sexual cathexis. His real lover isChillingworth, to whom he is locked in sterile sadomasochistic marriage.The bareness of Puritan plain style and the absence of inherited art worksstarved the American eye and aggravated the dangerous power of the visual whenit arrived via Romanticism. Asceticism, fearing the eye, actually sharpens it.Hawthorne illustrates the sexual problematics of the visual when Hester isbrought before the multitude: “The unhappy culprit sustained herself as best awoman might, under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes, all fastenedupon her, and concentred at her bosom. It was almost intolerable to be borne.”22[ch25_notes.html#ch22note22a] Hester as scapegoat is the focus of projectederoticism. The thousand eyes obsessively fixed on the scarlet letter are“concentred at her bosom” because the mother’s flowing breasts have beenexpelled from Puritan consciousness. There is a mass voyeurism of attraction andrepulsion. Let us follow Hawthorne’s language into all its strange implications.Hester bears the intolerably “heavy weight” of eyes “fastened upon her.”Surreally, the thousand eyes are attached to her bosom, sacs of engorgedsignificance. Standing on the platform that is the scene of western hierarchicassertion for Cellini’s Perseus, the picture of Dorian Gray, and Hitler atNuremberg, Hester is the Ephesian Artemis on her pedestal, the Asiaticmother-idol of a hundred animal breasts. Shelley saw vampire eyes in femalebreasts. Hester, like Vergil’s adultery-spurred Rumor, is spangled with multiplestaring eyes. At this cardinal moment, Hawthorne’s grotesque superornamentationof style is as Decadent as Gustave Moreau’s.An archetypal reading of The Scarlet Letter removes its Americanism, its senseof place. It also suppresses the plot. But the American elements in the LateRomantic Scarlet Letter are relatively superficial. Prerevolutionary New Englandis simply “the ancestral” in the shorthand of local dialect. It is no moreauthentic than the creaky medievalism of a Gothic novel. Plot is alwaysnegligible in Romanticism. Plot is history, cause and effect rationallyunfolding in time, but in Romantic poetry, history is irrationally propelledbackward toward the primeval. The plot proffered by Coleridge’s Ancient Marineris false. The same with The Scarlet Letter, which can be read for plot only ifone ignores huge emotional and sexual gaps. The Scarlet Letter is an archetypalvision of persecuted woman moving serenely in the magic circle of her sexualnature. Dimmesdale is a son-lover who longs to merge with the mother but cannot.Pearl is the infant son purged of his divisive maleness. Hester clones her inthe stress of solitude. Time has ground down the adulteress’ stones to sand,around which forms a perfect pearl. For Hawthorne-as-Dimmesdale, the mother isboth too near and too far. The Scarlet Letter formalizes Hawthorne’s ambivalentadult relation to his mother, who must be thrust into the mental distance forimagination’s survival.Herman Melville’s composition of Moby-Dick, a dawdling, on-and-off affair, wasgalvanized by his reading Hawthorne’s work and meeting with him in August 1850,shortly after publication of The Scarlet Letter. Moby-Dick took its present formin a burst of activity from that August to the next. The book, dedicated toHawthorne, was published in the fall. What artistic dynamic was at work betweenMelville and Hawthorne? I see Moby-Dick as a sexual reply to The Scarlet Letter.Both books correct a sexual exclusion, but Moby-Dick’s worldview is vaster.Melville drowns Protestant rationalism and Wordsworthian benevolence in a stormof barbaric nature-force. Behind Moby-Dick is Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner andPoe’s Maelström and Pym. Hawthorne symbolizes Protestant defects in anexcommunicated woman. But Melville, for his own reasons, cannot idealize woman.Moby-Dick, a chthonian epic, refuses to acknowledge the maternal as primary.Thus the novel sways back and forth between High Romanticism and Decadent LateRomanticism, between celebration of mighty nature and contorted resistance toit, in the florid manner of Huysmans.Moby-Dick rejects male sexual destiny, which Romanticism portrays as servitudeto female power. Melville declares: I shall revive the chthonian but inmasculine form. The novel subtly hermaphroditizes the great whale withoutgenuinely diluting his masculinity. Moby-Dick steals his “uncommon magnitude”from mother nature. Like Pym, the book honors a subterranean or submarine deity,a mute, amoral counterconception to talkative, lawgiving Jehovah. The whaleinhabits the primeval realm, from which he makes capricious epiphanies.The novel’s nonfiction sections, surveying the whale and its species, have twopurposes. Moby-Dick aspires to epistemology, organizing the known, if only todramatize what cannot be known. Melville plumbs and dissects his whale,measuring and naming each part. But his epic catalogs are feignings ofinclusiveness. They give every name to the great whale but one: mother. Thenovel’s cognitive data are fragments shored against male ruin. Again and again,Melville elevates the masculine principle above the feminine, driving back andlimiting female power. This book, which takes the whiteness or blankness ofnonmeaning as its premiere symbol and which is the first novel to acknowledge“the heartless voids and immensities of the universe,” should logically take adepersonalized view of nature.23 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note23a] But Melville’streatment of nature is amazingly inconsistent, full of the swerves of sexualanxiety.Moby-Dick is a lavish portrait of rapacious Sadean nature, “the universalcannibalism of the sea” and the “horrible vulturism of earth.” Melville rejectsChristian and Wordsworthian tenderness: “We are all killers, on land and onsea.” “Butchers we are” of “sharkish” will. Like Baudelaire, he challenges thehypocrite reader: “Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowdsof live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds…. Cannibals? whois not a cannibal?” Humanism and liberalism are daytime masks. Night releasesour animal appetites. One of the novel’s supreme moments is its archetypalvision of the great squid:A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-color,lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, andcurling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at anyhapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front did it have; noconceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on thebillows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.24[ch25_notes.html#ch22note24a]This is the snaky Medusa-head of nature, swampy and inert, a Burne-Jones thicketat sea. The squid is faceless, but is it sexless? We will see this “pulpy mass”again in Melville’s story The Paradise of Bachelors and The Tartarus of Maids,where it represents woman’s nonstop fertility.The squid is what Melville will not let his whale become. It is the femalegrossness of matter, a sticky, viscous web. He later revises the squid into themagnificent loom of vegetable nature, humming in its lush South Seas “bower.”Bowers, as bequeathed by Spenser through Milton to the Romantics, are the secretcells of female power. Melville does not simply drop the bower’s traditionalgender for a scientific inspection of nature’s machinery, which would beunderstandable. He strenuously personalizes and resexualizes his bower in theopposite direction. The loom is run by a “weaver-god” called “he.”25[ch25_notes.html#ch22note25a] This god is surprisingly like the Christian deitywhom Moby-Dick is otherwise eager to belittle and defame. Melville cannot bearto leave his loom gender-neutral, despite its appropriateness to his coldlystringent cosmology. Why? He feels too strongly the presence of female power inhis Romantic spectacle of seething greenery. The ultimate weaver of worldmythology is woman, and the loom is her body. Here Melville follows Blake inrefusing to concede female control over procreation.I suspect the heart of Moby-Dick was generated by Melville’s ambivalent reactionto Hawthorne’s female-centered work. Running through the novel’s bulkymidsection is a chain of improvised sexual images reflecting, I theorize, aprocess of association from Melville’s dream life. The weaver-god chapter is asexual cancellation of an earlier chapter, “The Grand Armada,” where a whaleboatis drawn into the eye of a whale herd moving in concentric circles. The boatrests in the “enchanted calm” of an “exceedingly transparent” lake. Far belowfloat pregnant and nursing whales. At first disturbance, everything vanishes.The episode has been compared to the Paradiso, where rings of angels form amystic rose of light. So this is Melville’s chthonian substitute for theChristian sublime. But there are no ambivalences in Dante’s vision. Midchapter,Melville compares the stillness to the “mute calm” amid “the tornadoed Atlanticof my being.” Man’s inner life is female, in the Romantic way. Billy Budd callsthe heart “sometimes the feminine in man,” like a “piteous woman” appealing to ajudge for mercy.26 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note26a] But at this unearthly moment inMoby-Dick, Melville’s axiom is too calculated and sententious. As with Coleridgeglossing his Mariner, the fearful and impersonal are rationalized and weakened.The first Grand Armada threatened America’s motherland, ruled by a queen. Who orwhat is menaced by Melville’s armada?That the whaleboat is “becalmed” in the maternal lake should alert us.Everything else in Moby-Dick champions the driven and stormy over the quiet andsheltered, that “lee shore” with which Melville identifies the “treacherous,slavish” complacencies of society and religion. D. H. Lawrence says Melville’ssea voyages were flights from “HOME and MOTHER”: “The two things that were hisdamnation.”27 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note27a] The becalmed whale-boat is in afallen, not a redeemed state. Masculine movement and action are paralyzed bystraying too near a magnetic omphalos-spot. This contemplative bliss isexperienced by men who have turned to stone. Through the glassy uterine waters,mother and child are seen united and in repose, but achingly across space andtime, for their peaceful uncomplexity of relation belongs to infancy. Man canregain this paradise state only by shrinking to a captive minnow, a genie in afemale bottle.“The Grand Armada” is a spectacle of uncanny luminosity with hidden dangers.Melville adds a strange footnote, an afterthought betraying his ambivalences. Hesays of the breasts of female whales: “When by chance these precious parts in anursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s pouring milk and bloodrivallingly discolor the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it hasbeen tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries.” Welcome to one ofHuysmans’ grotesque banquets, Coleridge’s milk of paradise served bloody rare.Melville sensualizes the blood and water of Christ’s spear wound. Milk and bloodaggressively compete with each other and with the stained sea. Mother and hunterare enemies. Archetypally, the hunter cuts her to escape from her. Theattraction and repulsion and the sequence of images are Decadent. The vividstrawberries, which follow rather than more humanely precede the spilled blood,are fleshy mammaries or red corpuscles forcing the bittersweet brew of milk andblood into the reader’s mouth. Behind this footnote is surely the strawberrymark on the face of Hawthorne’s heroine in The Birthmark. It too is red onwhite, “a crimson stain upon the snow.”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note28a]Hawthorne’s “bloody hand” symbolizes mother nature’s supremacy, which malescience rejects. In Melville as in Hawthorne, the female is maimed to limit herpower. But Hawthorne takes woman’s side, while Melville, despite himself, takesthe hunter’s.The chapters following “The Grand Armada” withdraw step by step from its alreadyqualified vision of female origins. On the next page, we are asked to admire thevast size of the male whale, an “Ottoman” among smaller, “delicate,”self-sacrificing “concubines.” Twenty pages later comes the first mention of themale weaver, when a castaway loses his wits and sees “God’s foot upon thetreadle of the loom.” Next page, the narrator Ishmael and his shipmates kneadtubs of spermaceti: “Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze!” The men clasp hands in the gooand exchange sentimental looks. “Would that I could keep squeezing that spermfor ever! … In visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, eachwith his hands in a jar of spermaceti.” This is Melville’s real heaven, anall-male platoon, each with his hand in someone else’s pocket. The circle jerkis another Romantic uroboros. Melville’s spermy male hands are a joyousdream-substitution for Hawthorne’s “bloody hand” of female nature. Turn anotherpage, and we are in Moby-Dick’s most totemic chapter, which focuses on thewhale’s penis, a “grandissimus” so heavy it takes three men to carry it. This“very strange, enigmatical object” or “unaccountable cone” is the “idol” of amale nature cult. Melville is practicing representational gigantism, the style Ifound in Michelangelo and Blake and defined as a defense against female power.To mince blubber, a sailor dons the whale’s tough penis skin like a priest’scassock.29 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note29a] This chapter is funny, but for thewrong reasons. Ithyphalloslichthyphallos: Greek comedy’s erections turn soddenand lugubrious in Melville. The whale has become a cartoon kingpin.Thus by a series of linked passages, in which the female is minimized in sizeand temper and the male maximized in member and function, Melville in less thanfifty pages inverts the maternal dominion of “The Grand Armada” into malecontrol of the loom of vegetable nature. Mythologically, there never has been apurely masculine vegetation deity. Melville demotes the female to a lower orderof being. I called Moby-Dick’s nature Sadean, but it is really Coleridgean. Thegreat squid, for example, is a version of The Ancient Mariner’s undulating seasnakes. Melville wants Coleridge’s nature without Coleridge’s vampire queen, theNightmare Life-in-Death. Hence he exaggerates his whale into the male “Titanismof power.” He indulgently dwells on the whale’s massive penis to givemasculinity integrity and visibility in the female sea of dissolution that is“Queen Nature.” He names Michelangelo as a fellow admirer of the “robustness”and “brawniness” of true divinity, which “the soft, curled, hermaphroditicalItalian pictures” fail to show. Whenever he gives his whale some feminine trait,Melville immediately cancels it by a masculine afterthought—of violence orrape.30 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note30a] Masculinity struggles for dominancethroughout Moby-Dick. The great whale’s “mighty mildness” is a homoerotictenderness, part of the longing for comradeship that Melville shares withWhitman, Lawrence, and Forster.Moby-Dick begins with a ritual of male bonding. Ishmael and Queequeg are tied by“matrimonial” language and bedroom embraces. The first chapters record theassembly and knitting together of men before they launch out onto nature’sturbulent bosom. Even the ship is an androgyne, with “bearded” bows. The “ship’snavel” is a gold doubloon, the badge of men not born of women or of men who havestruck out their female origins. The first mate laments he must “sail with sucha heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them.” Woman entersMoby-Dick only as displaced chthonian force. Her sexual allure is neveracknowledged, except in bawdy banter among three foreign sailors on watch.Woman’s allure is diverted into “the pagan harpooneers,” delegates of the races.Each bears some hermaphroditic sign: Tashtego and Fedallah have long hair;Daggoo wears gold ear hoops; Queequeg’s body is adorned with tattoos that burnwith “Satanic blue flames.” Melville’s Byronic harpooneers tower withimaginative authority. “Tawny features” set off by the “barbaric brilliancy” oftheir teeth, they are a lustrous coalescence of the ugly and the beautiful.31[ch25_notes.html#ch22note31a] The harpooneers are daemonic archangels, tanned byhellfire. I view their multiracialism as a sexual transposition. As Romanticsexual personae, silent, solitary, and proudly self-complete, they have stolentheir dark glittering glamour from repressed woman.Masculinity’s quest for dominance in Moby-Dick is struggling against a majorRomantic principle, impairment of the masculine. The novel ingeniously evadesthis rule by half-surrender. Its climax is the most devastating reversal of malewill in Romanticism, as the ship, smashed by the whale, sinks in the infernal“vortex” of Poe’s maelstrom. But only human masculinity suffers this crushingsubordination, the penalty for its hubris of assertion. Its chastiser is notfemale nature but a brute male dominator, perfect in unintelligible force. Thetax laid upon masculinity in Moby-Dick is evident in the burden of sexualsymbolism borne by Captain Ahab, the Romantic outlaw. He stands upon the “deadstump” of an amputated leg, a sexual injury consistent with his one-night-standmarriage. His artificial leg nearly pierces his groin, leaving an incurablewound: he is thigh-torn Adonis, severed from mother nature by his“unsurrenderable wilfulness.” A missing limb lingers as a “pricking” phantommemory. Therefore the harpoon Ahab darts at Moby-Dick is a phallic mentalprojection, born of frustrated desire. During his wildest speech, the harpoonlies “firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch,” a disturbingly suggestivephrase.32 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note32a]The scar running down Ahab’s face and body is “a birth-mark,” the mark of Cain.Ahab seems “made of solid bronze, … like Cellini’s cast Perseus,” that westernparadigm. Bronze is the Apollonian strategy of a man hardening himself againstnature. Ahab’s scar is his birthmark because he has no navel. It is from hisgolden body that the ship’s doubloon has been struck. He hails the paganlightning as his divine sire and, like Athena, claims to know no mother. Heusurps motherhood into his own overbearing will: “The queenly personality livesin me, and feels her royal rights.” It is Actium, and transsexualized Ahab isCleopatra defeated at sea.Ahab commandeers ship and crew in his lust for unconditional freedom. But likeliberal Romanticism itself, the worshipper of autonomy is under internal andexternal compulsion. Ahab is driven by a “hidden lord and master, and cruel,remorseless emperor”: “I act under orders.” Melville declares: “All men liveenveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks.” Thisumbilical halter, the harpoon line that will strangle Ahab, is Aeschylus’“harness of Necessity.” It is Clytemnestra’s net, the femme fatale of naturesymbolized in the writhing great squid. Earlier, Melville speaks of “thatimmaculate manliness we feel within ourselves” that remains “intact” through alldisaster.33 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note33a] The innermost self is a virgo intactaravished by life’s physical indignities. Immaculate manliness belongs to thoseuntouched by the humiliating “bloody hand” of Hawthorne’s female nature, whichthrusts us into the world. Whipsawed between paradoxes, Melville forces his ownsexual resolution on his Romantic materials. In Moby-Dick, his attempt tosuppress the indebtedness of male to female has produced a stunningsadomasochistic spectacle of male subdued to male.For perfect consistency, the great whale should be sexually neuter, its“appalling” whiteness an obliteration of person, gender, and meaning. But acrid,Late Romantic family romance intrudes upon a High Romantic epic of raw Dionysianenergy. Why is Moby-Dick staggeringly greater than anything else Melville wrote?The novel’s operatic gigantism comes from its force of sexual protest. Itsstorminess is a reaction against the paralyzing bliss of female stasis, glimpsedin “The Grand Armada.” Man searching for the secrets of nature is like “an Ohiohoney-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found suchexceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that hedied embalmed.” On the same page, Queequeg plays “obstetrics” in rescuingTashtego from a sinking whale’s head. The head is the prison of male intellect,says Melville, immediately revising his hollow tree into “Plato’s honey head,”in which so many have perished.34 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note34a] But this head isanother of Melville’s inflated male members, a hoaxing subterfuge. The realhoneyed crotch in which we all drown is the womb-tomb of mother nature.My view of the repressed sexual subject of Moby-Dick is confirmed by an oddstory Melville wrote in the next several years, The Paradise of Bachelors andThe Tartarus of Maids (published April 1855), which compares the sexualexperiences of men and women. The first part is naturalistic, while the secondis grotesque with biomorphic allegories. Is the story really liberal andreformist? I say it shows Melville’s social conscience arguing unsuccessfullyagainst his daemonic fear of woman and nature.Tartarus of Maids is a descent into a sexual underworld, both inferno andVenusberg. We are seeing the dark underbelly of High Romantic landscape.Melville surely takes his genital topography from Poe: Pym enters “a narrowgorge” with an “excessively slippery” cleft.35 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note35a]Melville’s gorge contracts into a clitoral “Black Notch,” then expands into alabial purple hollow amid “shaggy” pubic mountains. From vaginal “Devil’sDungeon” springs menstrual “Blood River,” boiling like Coleridge’s Alph amidhuge boulders. In Melville as in Poe, a polar zone turns ominously warm. Thetraveller of Tartarus of Maids tours a paper mill “stifling with a strange,blood-like abdominal heat.” The factory parodies procreation. “The dark colossalwater-wheel, grim with its one immutable purpose,” is woman’s inexorable monthlycalendar. Rows of girls, like “mares haltered to the rack,” shred fabric on a“long, glittering scythe,” tearing things apart to remake them. The scythe isPoe’s pendulum, here a phallic tool of father time. Next, in a messy“bespattered place,” are two great vats full of “a white, wet, woolly-lookingstuff, not unlike the albuminous part of an egg, soft-boiled.” The vats areovaries glutted with the mucoid, the swampy morass I identify with femalephysiology and Dionysus. This is another detail from Pym, with its gummy purplewater, a placenta shot with many-colored “veins” (cf. Coleridge’s sea-snakes).36[ch25_notes.html#ch22note36a] We have already seen Tartarus’ eggy batter in the“vast pulpy mass” of Moby-Dick’s “cream-colored” squid. Thus we know the squid’ssecret gender.I found in Blake’s indictment of woman-as-vampire a negative manifest contentmasking a latent content of impermissible attraction. Another split between aimand affect occurs in Tartarus, but in reverse. Melville shows women enslaved bytheir sexual destinies and exploited by a managerial class of carousingbachelors. But humanitarianism is the story’s first level of meaning only. Thefrostbite numbing the narrator’s cheeks is sexual fear and loathing. “Redly anddemoniacally boiled Blood River,” declares Melville in a moment of unguardedvision.37 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note37a] Woman is in league with the irrational.Nature, more than society, is her true oppressor. Menstruation and childbirth,which we long to regard as “normal” and “natural,” are surges of barbarism.Melville’s traveller, society’s emissary, stands speechless before theindustrial titanism of female nature.A sample of the story’s ambiguous duality: “At rows of blank-looking counterssat rows of blank-looking girls, with blank, white folders in their blank hands,all blankly folding blank paper.” Here is the boredom of mass production, themeaninglessness of modern labor alienating Melville’s self-entombed Bartleby,another paper pusher. But in Tartarus, there is no pity without terror. Theblank girls with blank pages are white goddesses creasing the tabula rasa ofman’s soul. They are blind, impassive Fates or Graiai. The narrator, whose boyVergil is named Cupid, shudders at the teeming circles of this hell. But hisrelation to the damned is far more ambivalent than Blake’s or Dickens’ to theirabused waifs. The inescapable fact is that Melville represents female physiologyas grossly spiritless, brute biological process.A huge machine stands in a corner, its piston hammering a heavy wood block. Apale girl feeds it rose paper, upon which it stamps a wreath of roses. Themill’s great paper-making machine is an “inflexible iron animal,” at which thenarrator gazes in awe. Heavy machinery of this kind strikes “strange dread intothe human heart, as some living, panting Behemoth might.” What is “so speciallyterrible” is “the metallic necessity, the unbudging fatality.” “The thin gauzyvail of pulp” marches on “in unvarying docility to the autocratic cunning of themachine.” The narrator stands “spell-bound”: “A fascination fastened on me.”38[ch25_notes.html#ch22note38a]The wreath of roses is love poetry’s naively cheerful commentary on sexexperience. But men are not the villains. Like Baudelaire’s “A Carcass,”Tartarus exposes the gap between literary convention and nature’s reality toevoke horror rather than empathy. The narrator, spellbound by Romanticfascination, is paralyzed before the Medusahead of vegetable nature. The phallicpiston itself is driven by the machine. Tartarus contains Moby-Dick’s true loom.The tyrant machine is the female body, grinding and milling the pulp of matter,the gluten of human flesh.The narrator asks the proprietor why female workers are “indiscriminately calledgirls, never women.”39 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note39a] Melville anticipatesfeminist complaint on this argot, which shrinks women to children.Mythologically, however, the girls of Tartarus are virgin kore figures. They arePersephones whose mother Demeter is too monstrous to take human form, for she isthe machine. Note the link to Moby-Dick: Melville calls the machine a living“Behemoth”; the girls’ blankness is the great whale’s “appalling” (literally,pale-making) whiteness. Moby-Dick, who should be gender-neutral, is so fiercelymasculine in order to keep him from turning into a female. In other words, thewhale’s hypermasculinity defensively obscures the femaleness of nature. Thematernal peace and beauty of Melville’s “Grand Armada” are a poignant sexualdream, for Tartarus reveals the horror of what must be repressed. I repeatedlycall woman “the hidden.” Tartarus of Maids makes the invisible visible. We seethe hydrodynamics of female engineering articulated into rational clarity. Tosee, to know, to sympathize. But a daemonic energy wells up from belowMelville’s consciousness to deform the female organs into disgusting disjectamembra at surreal cubist angles. Tartarus contains the marine descent eluded bythe lone survivor of Moby-Dick. In its quest to give masculinity cosmicdominance, Melville’s epic novel has had to smother nature’s chthonian plumbing.The Tartarus of Maids, a nightmare condensation of Moby-Dick’s chthonian theme,is the reverse image of Melville’s last story, Billy Budd, Sailor, which he leftin draft at his death in 1891. Tartarus’ ugly, turgid procreative realm isopposed by Billy Budd’s daylit Apollonian realm of beauty, clarity, andcharisma. Billy Budd is the supreme Apollonian work of American literature, towhich visionary idealism is foreign because of the cultural bias towardpragmatism. In Melville’s oeuvre, Billy Budd is to Tartarus as Balzac’sSeraphita is to The Girl with the Golden Eyes: the celestial seraphic supplantsthe hell of female barbarism. Billy Budd was made possible by Melville’s descentto and escape from the female miasma.Billy Budd belongs to the glamourous company of beautiful boys we have tracedfrom the Athenian Kritios Boy to Donatello’s David, Shakespeare’s fair youth,and Wilde’s Dorian Gray. In the first manuscript (1886), he was much older. Thestory is dedicated to Jack Chase, an Englishman who also inspired White-Jacket(1850). Citing Melville’s admiration of an Antinous sculpture in Rome during histravels of 1856–57, Fiedler calls Billy Budd “Jack Chase recast in the image ofAntinoüs.”40 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note40a] My own theory is that The Picture ofDorian Gray affected Billy Budd, in which I hear echoes of Wilde’s language. Ayear before its release in book form, Dorian Gray appeared in the July 1890issue of Lippincott’s Monthly (Philadelphia and London). Scholars cannot tellwhen Billy Budd regressed from adult to ephebe.41 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note41a]I suspect Dorian Gray revived Melville’s memories of Antinous and produced thefinal story’s more androgynous hero.Billy Budd has a springtime freshness. Though twenty-one, he has “a lingeringadolescent expression” and smooth “feminine” complexion. He has “yellow curls”and “welkin eyes”—literally, sky eyes. He is an “Apollo,” a purebred product of“the Saxon strain”: his blonde Apollonian radiance is the Dorian or Aryanelement in European culture. He is “an angel,” like “Fra Angelico’s seraphs,”who have “the faint rosebud complexion of the more beautiful English girls.”Transsexual similes compare Billy to “a rustic beauty” or “vestal priestess.” Inhis single defect, he is “like the beautiful woman in one of Hawthorne’s minortales”—that is, The Birthmark. His unknown mother is visible in his curvedmouth, small ear, and arched foot. The crew call him “Beauty,” like a fairy-talemaiden. His “masculine beauty” is an androgynous combination of “strength andbeauty,” “comeliness and power,” like the duality of Gautier’s contralto.42[ch25_notes.html#ch22note42a]Like Dorian Gray, Billy Budd is structured by Apollonian hierarchy. Billybelongs to the class of “Handsome Sailor,” a “superior figure” of “naturalregality.” His peers, “the lesser lights of his constellation,” make him a starand offer him “spontaneous homage.” The love child clearly shows “nobledescent”: he is a half-divine hero with a mysterious birth. Like Dorian, Billyis an exemplar of pure charisma. His shipmates make him gifts, “do his washing,darn his old trousers”: “Anybody will do anything for Billy Budd.”43[ch25_notes.html#ch22note43a] The crew are vassals offering tokens of feudalsubordination. Billy crystallizes hierarchy around himself, an Apollonianvertical cutting the sea’s horizontals.Billy Budd’s catastrophe is a clash of hierarchic orders. The Iago-likemaster-at-arms, John Claggart, drifts into strange enmity toward Billy. Melvilleplainly specifies “what it was that had first moved him against Billy, namely,his significant personal beauty”—a phrase straight out of Wilde. Claggart’s“monomania” is an erotic and aesthetic obsession. He is oppressed and enslavedby Billy’s beauty, a western pattern invented by Sappho and revived by Petrarch.“Magnetically” drawn to Billy against his will, Claggart protests hissubordination by the sodomitic baton tap he gives Billy from behind. It isprovoked by spilled soup, which Claggart subconsciously experiences as chthoniancontamination. “He was about to ejaculate something hasty at the sailor, butchecked himself”: Claggart simmers with self-poisoned desire. He is a broodingskeptic who converts the visionary and seraphic into a nauseated sense ofviolation by Billy’s mental image. Claggart’s “official” tap aggressivelyrestores conventional hierarchy. He tries this again in the accusation scene,where he “mesmerically” stares at Billy, a daemonic eye-intercourse Melvilleborrows from Hawthorne.44 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note44a]Billy is a “peacemaker” who transforms the crew’s quarters from “a rat-pit ofquarrels.” The merchant captain says, “Not that he preached to them or said ordid anything in particular; but a virtue went out of him, sugaring the sourones.” This virtue is aesthetic rather than moral. It is virtu, the beautiful orrare. Billy’s beauty induces mass cathexis, quelling the competitive many intocontemplative unity. But his charismatic personal hierarchy is at odds withpublic hierarchy. Obliviously, he makes his own cult, which must be suppressedby Caesar. Billy Budd follows in the line of the beautiful boy as destroyer bycausing disorder in the social realm. W. H. Auden says, “It is not an accidentthat many homosexuals should show a special preference for sailors, for thesailor on shore is symbolically the innocent god from the sea who is not boundby the law of the land and can therefore do anything without guilt.”45[ch25_notes.html#ch22note45a] The law of the land is administered by CaptainVere, who reluctantly sentences Billy to death for killing an officer. Becauseof and not despite his fascinating glamour, Billy must die for the collectivegood. Strung up from the main yard, he is the ancient hanging god, an Adonisritually slain in the flower of youth. Richard Chase calls him “thehermaphrodite Christ.”46 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note46a] Like Christ, Billy posesan internal threat to an empire at war. They’re right to hang him.As a beautiful boy, Billy Budd is not cruel, but he is narcissistic—the primarynarcissism of the child. The beautiful boy’s solipsism is in Billy’s stutter,the “vocal infirmity” halting his speech under stress. The Apollonian, asalways, is a mode of silence or muteness. Billy lacks “self-consciousness”: his“simple nature” is the unitary Apollonian character, internally undeveloped. Heis “illiterate,” unlettered because the Apollonian androgyne has no words. WhenClaggart lies, Billy struggles to reply but, frustrated, fells his accuser withone blow. He is Phoebus (the Pure), avenging profanation by expelling theinvader from his immaculate psychic space. After Billy’s death, the surgeon isasked why there was no movement in the body, since a hanged man is usuallyconvulsed by a “mechanical spasm.”47 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note47a] Billy diesthe ever-virgin, undefiled by orgasm. Another Apollonian principle: thebeautiful boy rejects orgasm because of Apollo’s flight from the temporal. Thereis no motion because there is no Dionysian rhythm, only crystalline stasis.Billy Budd inverts The Tartarus of Maids. This all-male saga shuts out chthonianfemale power. We last see Billy “ascending” into the rosy dawn: the risingseraph opposes Melville’s descent to the gloomy realm of Goethe’s Mothers.Philosophically, the beautiful boy abolishes the density of female matter (materand materia have the same root). Apollonian androgynes make the visible worldvibrate with spiritual illumination. Like Moby-Dick, Billy Budd defies Hawthorneby stealing sexual authority from woman. Melville gives purified femininity tothe beautiful boy, shimmering with Apollonian light.Billy Budd was not published until 1924, so it could not have influenced ThomasMann’s Death in Venice (1911), which is deeply indebted to The Picture of DorianGray. Death in Venice is a late flower of the fin de siècle. Civilization is indecay: Venice, the city of art, is “diseased,” “filled with the smell of thingsrotting.” The writer Gustav von Aschenbach arrives in Venice to find, likeGoethe in the Venetian Epigrams and Hofmannsthal in The Death of Titian (1892),that it harbors a fascinating adolescent androgyne. What Melville polarizes inthe antithesis Billy Budd/Tartarus of Maids Mann condenses in one tale.Aschenbach has a vision of primeval nature, clearly inspired by Huysmans: “atropical swampland under a heavy murky sky, damp, luxuriant and enormous, a kindof prehistoric wilderness … sluggish with mud,” “hairy shafts of palms risingout of a rank lecherous thicket,” “fat, swollen” plant life rooted in green“stagnant pools.”48 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note48a] This is the female swamp ofgeneration, the chthonian miasma against which the beautiful boy dreamilyprotests, his dazzling formal perfection a rebuke to nature’s indiscriminatenessand fluidity. The swampland of Death in Venice corresponds to Tartarus’ pulpy“albuminous” matrix.Aschenbach, the man of words, is captivated by an image of the Apollonian visualarts. An “absolutely beautiful,” longhaired fourteen-year-old boy, straight outof “Greek sculpture,” appears in an epiphany of Apollonian stillness. Surroundedby women—a governess, imposing mother, and three “nunlike sisters”—Tadzio is asequestered god doomed to die young. Arriving near May Day, Mann’s vernalandrogyne is an Adonis, the privileged son-lover of a mother goddess. I suspectthis cool, dignified woman wandering alone with her children was inspired byHawthorne’s mother-of-Pearl, Hester Prynne. She wears a simple gray dressstrangely oramented with “priceless” jewelry and pearls, a “fantasticallylavish” effect—reminiscent of Hester’s plain Puritan dress and sumptuous scarletletter, embroidered in “Oriental” style.49 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note49a]Tadzio has the Apollonian attributes of “aristocratic distinction” and vocalimpediment. Because the boy is Polish, “Aschenbach did not understand a word hesaid”; the writer sees him “smiling, with something half muttered in his softvague tongue.” Tadzio’s Delphic utterances, like Billy Budd’s stutter andBelphoebe’s broken sentences, are another Apollonian muteness. Tadzio has aradical visibility. Each of his appearances is literally spectacular, as in histheophanic emergence from the sea. He steps from the waves not because he is ofthe sea but because he renounces the fluid realm, the seraph transcendingfoam-born Venus. “Astonished, terrified” by Tadzio’s “godlike beauty,”Aschenbach is as hierarchically subordinated as Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray orClaggart to Billy Budd. Death in Venice explicitly incorporates the referencesto Plato’s Phaedrus I found implicit in Dorian Gray: Aschenbach experiences “thehot terror which the initiates suffer when their eyes light on an image of theeternal beauty.”50 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note50a]Like Basil, Aschenbach is an artist destroyed by a beautiful boy, who dresses inan “English sailor suit,” a period style that may be an allusion to Wilde.Mythologically, Tadzio’s sailor suit belongs to Saxon Billy Budd. But Mann’sbeautiful boy is more solipsistic than Melville’s, his fatality literalized bythe epidemic claiming his admirer’s life. Though their eyes sometimes meet, theboy does not really see Aschenbach: “It was the smile of Narcissus bent over thereflecting water, that deep, fascinated, magnetic smile with which he stretchesout his arms to the image of his own beauty.”51 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note51a]Aschenbach’s eyes are mirrors in which Tadzio sees nothing but himself.Obsessed, the writer imagines invitation where there is only autism. Thebeautiful boy, iconically isolated, is a mirage of the inflamed eye. As part ofits Decadence, Death in Venice makes a Florentine beautiful boy a symbol ofheterosexual Venice in its degenerate late phase.Even at the height of hallucination, Aschenbach does not desire sex. Ittrivializes Death in Venice to reduce it, as has been done, to a homosexualchronicle of coming out of the closet. The beautiful boy is never contaminatedby touch, for the Apollonian recedes with every step taken toward it. StalkingTadzio through the streets, Aschenbach carefully preserves the criticalaesthetic distance. He has become the deranged fan of the star-god. Thebeautiful boy, always fatal to his admirers, leads Aschenbach from dynastic andprofessional dignity toward self-immolation in the pre-Hellenic past. LikeEuripides’ Pentheus, Aschenbach is transvestized and Orientalized: decked withjewels, he uses perfume, dye, mascara, rouge. The western analytic mind isreabsorbed into its sultry Asiatic origins. Mann calls the Byzantine basilica ofSan Marco, into which Aschenbach pursues Tadzio, an “Oriental temple”;Aschenbach is felled by “Asiatic cholera,” “hatched in the warm swamps of theGanges delta.”52 [ch25_notes.html#ch22note52a] If we step back from thenaturalistic surface of Death in Venice and look at it mythologically, we willsee that it contains, internalized, Melville’s female Tartarus. A jealous mothergoddess envelops her son’s admirer in her chthonian miasma, for it is she whobrings the pestilence into the city of art."},{"pageContent":"23AMERICAN DECADENTSEmerson, Whitman, JamesRalph Waldo Emerson, whose father and forefathers were ministers, was caught inthe clash between American Protestantism and English Romanticism. As atranscendentalist, he sought to open imagination to nature, in the Wordsworthianway. Emerson thought of himself as a poet, and although lectures and essays madehis fame, controversy over the essays’ vague structure was almost immediate. NoRomantic work need conform to Apollonian logic. But are there psychologicalreasons for Emerson’s eccentricities of style?The essays are a treasure-trove of idea and maxim. Linguistically, Emerson’sstyle occupies a magic convergence point, the crux of European languages. Hereads as Plato, Augustine, and Nietzsche translate: an exalted clarity, thewords orotund yet translucent, qualities that seem to belong to the typescriptitself. But never has there been a prose more magnificent in pieces and moreoppressive as a whole. Emerson’s voice has an unnatural sameness, a phlegmaticflat affect. He lacks music—dynamics, melody, variation. We are feeling theburden of Protestant moralism, which Emerson never could shake off.Emerson calls poets “liberating gods”: “They are free, and they make free.”Symbol-making means “emancipation and exhilaration”: “We seem to be touched by awand which makes us dance and run about happily, like children.”1[ch25_notes.html#ch23note1a] Emerson exhilarated? The joyful, spontaneous poetis what he longs to be but is not. Though his best lyrics are tense andmuscular, they are hampered by excessive shortness of line. This gives speed,but speed is not Emerson’s strong suit. He has a slower, graver mind ofWordsworthian deliberativeness. The poetry is far less realized than the essays,which swarm with brilliant Romantic images.The principal charge against the essays is disorganization. The problem, as Isee it, is that Emerson constantly interrupts or reverses his line of thought,leaving each set of ideas languishing in a solitary cell. Circularity has itssymbolic uses, as in George Herbert’s “A Wreath,” whose verses intertwine in aperfect solar circle. Emerson’s Circles follows this contemplative tradition:“The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second.”2[ch25_notes.html#ch23note2a] But his wandering essay style does not always seempremeditated. I think it arises from some stoppage at the deepest generativelevel of language. From the archaic cave of the unconscious, wraithlikemorphological wholes emerge to incarnate themselves in words. Image, rhythm,emotion are first; words are later.Before Romanticism, literary style is shared discourse. After Romanticism, styleis persona. Emerson may be the first whose style tells us so much. The monotonyof his prose is ultimately a limitation on internalized personae, for each ofour moods is the shadow of a persona. His essays, as adventures in voice, arestruggles against the masculine Puritan past, which traps him in thesharp-bounded ethical ego. Transcendentalism seeks unity with nature byrejecting codes and institutions. But in Emerson the self itself, paralyzed byits own cultivation, is the obstacle to unity.Emerson’s conflicts are evident in his notorious eyeball metaphor: “Standing onthe bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinitespace,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing;I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am partor parcel of God.”3 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note3a] High Romantic aspiration; LateRomantic eye. Barbara Packer says, “Emerson’s Eyeball has provoked scorn eversince its unsettling appearance in the first edition of Nature.” The eyeball,she notes, is a later addition to the original passage in the journals.4[ch25_notes.html#ch23note4a] Emerson is trying to remove the barriers betweenman and nature. His eyeball is a version of the Romantic Aeolian lyre: the“currents” circulating through him recall the West Wind sweeping throughShelley. Emerson intensifies the lyre’s androgyny, to ill effect. Passive to thelife force, he no longer sings but only sees. Seeing without doing, Idemonstrated, is a primary principle of Decadent Late Romanticism. Emersonenvies the eastern eye of mystic vision, but he cannot escape the history-heavysolidity of European personae.Emerson’s eyeball has the two properties I found in his prose: orotundity andtranslucence. The eyeball is ponderous, a dirigible his afflatus is not quiteable to lift. The “bare ground” is naked, bald like his “bathed” or baptizedinfant head. The eyeball is concrete and monumental, a frozen colossusventilated by the dawn breeze. Emerson longs to merge but cannot. The eyeball inwhich nothing can befall him is a uterine sac, a glass alembic through which hepeers like Goethe’s Homunculus. He is locked “In the belly of the grape” of hispoem “Bacchus.” The eyeball is the uncrushed grape of separation, the Apollonianskull of intellectual and connoisseur.The transparent eyeball is significantly an afterthought—a self-betrayingpattern I found in Melville. The image’s lateness is its mark of Decadentperversity. Packer says, “‘Eye’ is a neutral word, but ‘eyeball’ has somethinggrotesque about it; it smacks too much of the dissecting room.”5[ch25_notes.html#ch23note5a] We have a new item for our lurid list ofnineteenth-century amputations: Berenice’s teeth, Balzac’s instep, Gautier’sfoot, Cleopatra’s lip, Gogol’s nose, Wilde’s chin, Emerson’s eyeball. Emerson’sdetached retina is gross and shocking because it is a swollen Late Romanticmember: the part exalted over the whole, an immobile and isolated looking. Thisglobe of extracted tissue quivers with infirmity. It is Plato’s circle-androgynestripped of its limbs and abandoned. Emerson’s apparent escape from egotism isanother Romantic uroboros, the circular track on which the self meets the self.In his journals he says, “Man is insular, and cannot be touched. Every man is aninfinitely repellent orb.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note6a] The self’s untouchableorb repels invaders, like a citadel, but it also repels or repulses in theaesthetic sense. The repellent eyeball is a Decadent self-portrait, like thegrisly picture of Dorian Gray. Emerson-as-eyeball says he is “part or parcel ofGod.” Pack up our Decadent parts with golden twine, but this parcel is too heavyfor air mail.Transparency, I have shown, is an Apollonian phenomenon: it is the density offemale matter pierced and vanquished by the aggressive western eye. So what is abulky ophthalmic transparency doing in the middle of a celebration of nature? Weare close to the contradictions at the heart of Emerson’s work. He seems to takea Dionysian view of reality: “Metamorphosis is the law of the universe. Allforms are fluent.” He speaks of the “evanescence and lubricity of all objects”:“All things swim and glitter.” This could be a defense of his wandering prosestyle: “The quality of the imagination is to flow, and not to freeze.”7[ch25_notes.html#ch23note7a] He would prefer Dionysian process to Apolloniancontour and stasis. The essays fragment because he suspends Apollonian mastercontrol: there is no hierarchical ascent or progress of argumentation. The proselies in multiples, a Dionysian “Many.” Unfortunately, this multiplicity is alsoDecadent decay and too-muchness, which clot Emerson’s essays into unreadability.But it is poetry that Emerson yearned for, not the essay. What inhibitions didhe suffer when he took up the poet’s mask? I described the transparent eyeballas a bald fetal androgyne. It is a projected self purged of gender and evenextension in the body. Romantic poets are always self-consciouslyhermaphroditic; thus Emerson calls the “highly endowed man” a “Man-woman” whoneeds no wife. He sees the great man as a feminine receptor of historical force,his “impressionable brain” prophetically vibrating to the future. But thetranssexual theme is only fleetingly present. We usually get the opposite. InNature, for example, Emerson says of “Spirit” as “Creator”: “Man in all ages andcountries embodies it in his language as the FATHER.”8[ch25_notes.html#ch23note8a] This garish battery of capitals, blinking like afactory sign, is an irregular emphasis for Emerson, and the benign father-godwhom it enshrines has no business in a Romantic work. At this moment, Emersonhas surrendered to his Protestant forefathers. His imperialistic headline isapotropaic, guarding Nature against a contrary sexual force.Emerson rarely mentions women, from whom Romanticism normally draws its power.His principal poems feature males: “Uriel,” “Merlin,” “Bacchus,” “Brahma.” Thefew archetypal females are quickly cited. “Maia,” the veil of illusion, has justone stanza. “The Sphinx” is long and juicy but ends in the outwitting of theSphinx and the defeat of female power: “Through a thousand voices / Spoke theuniversal dame; / ‘Who telleth one of my meanings / Is master of all I am.’”This is what is wished, not what is. No man, no poet, not even the greatest ofarchimagi, is master of female nature. Emerson’s imagination is hopelesslysplit: he dons Blakean armour on a Wordsworthian quest.Woman appears so little in Emerson that when she does she has enormous force. Hesays in Fate: “Men are what their mothers made them. … When each comes forthfrom his mother’s womb, the gate of gifts closes behind him.”9[ch25_notes.html#ch23note9a] This stunning indebtedness of man to woman is thepessimistic truth. Emerson’s doctrine of self-reliance, by which Americadeclared independence of European culture, is also a rejection of a female past.As a poet, Emerson is stuck. English Romanticism enables him to turn away fromhis rationalist heritage toward nature. But the absence of an American motherimago prevents him from activating the other crucial component of Romanticconsciousness, the sexual archetypal, without which no Romantic poem can bewritten.The Sphinx is everything Emerson’s poetry has refused to internalize. “Bacchus,”for example, stubbornly avoids the chthonian, which should be intrinsic to itstheme of mystic union. The poem’s quickness and excitement may come from itsenergy of evasion. Its short, hasty lines are Decadent terminations,self-severings, a boundary line drawn just before the poet is entered by femaleforce, with its blurring dissolutions. Emerson’s incomplete hermaphrodization asa Romantic poet obstructs the organic form of essay and poem, flattens mood andtone, and inserts an Apollonian eyeball into an ode to nature. As a Romanticsexual persona, Emerson’s “I” is half-born.American poetry’s opening toward woman was achieved by Emerson’s admirer, WaltWhitman, whose long untidy poetic line takes in everything Emerson excludes. TheDionysian, which Emerson wrongly envisions in discrete images, is a torrent intowhich Whitman eagerly plunges.Whitman invents the American nature-mother, a heaving cycle of birth and deathgorged with objects and persons. She is “the ocean of life,” “the fierce oldmother.” She is voluptuous darkness, archaic night: “Press close bare-bosom’dnight—press close magnetic nourishing night!” Whitman corrects Wordsworth’sbenign maternalism without resorting to Coleridge’s horrific vampirism. Bybardic instinct rather than learning, he revives the cosmology of the ancientmother cults. He imagines a turbulent world-pregnancy: “Urge and urge and urge,/ Always the procreant urge of the world … always substance and increase, alwayssex.” He hears “Voices … of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs andof the father-stuff.”10 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note10a] The all-motherencompassing this propagating universe is sexually dual. Whitman is son-loverand priest of the hermaphrodite goddess, with whom he unites throughimpersonation. He wants to assimilate all being into the self, imagined as acapacious sac. The epic catalogs of Leaves of Grass are the poet’s gluttonousself-fecundation or female swelling, a portrait of the artist as Great Mother, aUniversal Man-Woman.Whitman solicits sexualized intrusions into his psyche. His technique isidentification, the Dionysian empathic: “Of every hue and caste am I, of everyrank and religion, / A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker, /Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.” These multiple personae,from pimp to priest, level the great chain of being. “Maternal as well aspaternal,” Whitman makes transsexual projections: “I am the actor, the actress”or “the sleepless widow” or a girl primping for her gentleman-caller. The poetrytakes in all of earth’s creatures. One sequence lists three dozen animals,insects, fish, and plants, from panther to crab to persimmon. “My loverssuffocate me,” says Whitman; they call his name “from flower-beds, vines,tangled underbrush.” Like Keats, he imitates Dionysus’ extension throughout theripe “Many” of the world. He bursts every barrier: “Unscrew the locks from thedoors! / Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!” There must be noApollonian sequestration: privacy or purity are sterile patches, seceding fromwholeness. Leaves of Grass has a promiscuous all-inclusiveness. DemocraticDionysus broadens significance to refuse, chips and scraps: “the deform’d,trivial, flat, foolish, despised”; “Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, andthe sea-gluten, / Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, leftby the tide.” Judeo-Christian man rules this world, but Dionysian man is ruledby it. Whitman synthesizes contraries: “Do I contradict myself? … I am large, Icontain multitudes.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note11a] Dionysus’ polymorphousperversity breaks down Apollonian categorization and hierarchy.Emerson’s prophecy of the poet as liberator was fulfilled by Whitman, whoserevolutionary free verse, like Antony in Egypt, “o’erflows the measure.” It setsall things into motion in nature’s flux. In its freewheeling structure andperpetual metamorphoses, Leaves of Grass is literature’s most perfectlyDionysian poetry. It descends from ancient chants naming the attributes, fruits,crops, and animals of the earth-mother to awaken and stimulate her fertility.Whitman’s weaknesses also come from his Dionysianism, which offends Apollonianform and decorum. At his best, he has the sublimity of Pindar; at his worst, heis screechy and cornball, like a carnival barker. But remember the unhappyprecedent of Emerson, who could not become Dionysus Lusios (the Liberator)because of his intellectual refinement.Like Baudelaire, Whitman seeks to scandalize the Christian and bourgeois. He isthe conduit of “forbidden voices, / Voices of sexes and lusts … Voices indecentby me clarified and transfigur’d.” He makes another swerve from the Protestantpast. Puritanism, an austere cult of the inner life, honored acts but notobjects. The pagan Leaves of Grass, sweeping a jumble of reborn objects intoitself, removes the ethical dimension from acts, which are now merelyexperiences. The Puritan will, lulled in a Turkish bath of female relaxation,drops its confrontationalism. Whitman speaks of “Winds whose soft-ticklinggenitals rub against me.” Or he sees “the young men float on their backs, theirwhite bellies bulge to the sun.”12 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note12a] There are noerections in this world. Penises are pollen-flecked fruit stirred by the breeze,or glossy tubers lapped in water. There is no tension or discipline, becauseLeaves of Grass makes languorous female realities supreme.Whitman’s Dionysian multiplicities are a pagan syncretism, as shown by hisEmerson-inspired appeals to “Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha.”13[ch25_notes.html#ch23note13a] D. H. Lawrence complains that Whitman’s greedy“song of myself” turns the self into “a mush,” “a hotch-potch,” “the awfulpudding of One Identity”.14 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note14a] Like the Hinduism ofForster’s A Passage to India (the title of Whitman’s last poem), the zeal tohonor and absorb everything courts a collapse into nondifferentiation. ButWhitman, who portrays himself as a Madonna della Misericordia, a hundred figureswrapped in her compassionate cloak, never fully succeeds in his Dionysian drivetoward one expanded identity. Like Emerson with his heavy eyeball, Whitman findsthe will-to-merge blocked by a veil of flesh, his troublesome self. Leaves ofGrass asserts unity but proves separateness. Its genial song of “EmbraceableYou” draws reality in to fill a gnawing emptiness. This apparently generouspoetry is marred by moral ambiguities, of which the most lurid is a Decadentvoyeurism. Like MobyDick, Leaves of Grass is a High Romantic work bedeviled byLate Romantic impulses.Whitman loves to linger in imagination by the beds of the sleeping and sick, ataste he later put into action in Civil War hospitals. The Sleepers, which Icompared to Blake’s “Infant Joy,” is a rhapsody on this subject: “I wander allnight in my vision, / Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly steppingand stopping, / Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers.” Hestands in the dark, passing his hands “soothingly to and fro a few inches fromthem.” He goes “from bedside to bedside,” visiting children, corpses, drunks,onanists, idiots, spouses, sisters, everyone asleep or dead.In class, Milton Kessler spoke of The Sleepers’ “ghoulishness” and “prurience.”The poet makes “a magical godlike gesture” over the sleepers, who are “likefetuses”: “He creates them. They are all helpless before him.” Whitman’ssympathy and identification are based on aggression and invasion. The poem has askopophiliac tyranny: the omnipotent eye forces passivity on its objects,denying them personal consciousness. Whitman, normally the Dionysian enemy ofhierarchy, spreads all mankind before him from horizon to horizon, in abjectpostures of subordination. The sleepers are matter awaiting the impress of hismind. His criminal trespass, a violation of their dreams as well as bedrooms,has a hushed erotic excitement. The poem is a psychosexual breaking andentering, and Whitman is the vampire who walks by night.Like Blake, Whitman claims to shatter false laws, banishing sexual secrecy andshame. But his jovial exhibitionism is a mask. The Sleepers shows the scope ofhis self-concealment. As in “Kubla Khan,” the eyes of the crowd are closed tothe poet, but now it is the poet who closes them. The Sleepers is a nocturnalpatrol through the city of the dead. Whitman’s relation to people is tense. Hedoes not genuinely celebrate their otherness, their multiple identities, forthese condemn him to solitude. Hence he “infolds” them in archaic night,drowning them in the democracy of dissolution. His taut self-curtailments are aDecadent closure. Whitman has a Late Romantic sister-spirit in Americanliterature. His Decadent voyeurism looks forward to the lubriciousdeath-connoisseurship of Emily Dickinson. Unexpectedly, the hobo sexualiconoclast and the spinster recluse share the same perverse sensibility.Whitman’s sexual prowess is also not what it seems. Unable to trust his poetry’shermaphroditic message, he spent a lot of time advertising a virility that hassince proved to be false. He wonderfully describes himself as “hankering, gross,mystical, nude,” “Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.” Hespurns “neuters and geldings” in favor of “men and women fully equipt.”15[ch25_notes.html#ch23note15a] This is not biography but psychography. That is,such fictive assertions constitute the masculine personae of the bisexual Leavesof Grass. In fact, the hermaphroditic all-mother is so potent a conception thatthe individual male is unnecessary. Like Balzac’s avenger gathering an armedretinue to enter the female realm of the Oriental boudoir, Whitman mustoveremphasize his maleness to retain his own sex in the surging female nature ofhis poetry.Because of his identification with the Great Mother, masculinity is the feeblestof Whitman’s personae. His pseudomale would pop like a birthday balloon.Swinburne, whose sensuous ocean mother was inspired by Whitman’s, has no sexualanxiety in the same situation. He welcomes male subordination to woman, probablybecause he has the authority of Sade and Baudelaire behind him. Upper-classSwinburne comes to poetry from the salon world of manners, but Whitman cannotescape his proletarian past, where a man is a man by labor and robustness. HenceLeaves of Grass makes us listen to the tiresome rattling of an imaginary saber.Although lust for women is merely mimed, Whitman is not at all misogynistic: “Isay it is as great to be a woman as to be a man, / And I say there is nothinggreater than the mother of men.” He honors even the machinery of procreation,which unlike Melville he anatomizes with ardor: “The womb, the teats, nipples,breast-milk, tears, laughter.” Like Keats, Whitman speaks of “the udder of myheart,” from which his poetry drinks. Heterosexual desire is another matter. Thereal eroticism of Leaves of Grass goes toward athletic males in Iliadicspectacles of pleasure-pain: “I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming nakedthrough the eddies of the sea. … I see his white body, I see his undauntedeyes.” He is dashed on the rocks, “baffled, bang’d, bruis’d.” The waves arespotted with his blood: “They roll him, swing him, turn him, / His beautifulbody is borne in the circling eddies. … Swiftly and out of sight is borne thebrave corpse.”16 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note16a] Voyeuristic Whitman, a hoveringgull, luxuriates in the red rents made in a white male beauty. The scenecombines Achilles’ combat with the River Scamander with Odysseus’ batteringagainst the sea cliff. But Homer’s heroes survive. Whitman prefers a LateRomantic sexual script, sensuously sadomasochistic and terminated by martyrdomat nature’s hands.For Whitman, homosexual action and gratification are as inconceivable as anyother. His eroticism remains in Decadent voyeuristic suspension. When he entershis sexual scenes, rather than hanging back in spectral aloofness, he is passiveto displaced sex acts. He remembers “How you settled your head athwart my hipsand gently turn’d over upon me, / And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, andplunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, / And reach’d till you felt mybeard, and reach’d till you held my feet.” Unlike Christabel, whose tongue isstolen by homosexual rape, Whitman gains another, which snakes through him andincites him to ecstasies of language. The companion passage is the fantasy ofthe male heroine I cited vis-à-vis Swinburne: “I am the mash’d fireman withbreast-bone broken, / Tumbling walls buried me in their debris.”17[ch25_notes.html#ch23note17a] This is the bosom-bone broken by the male tongue,a homosexual defloration. The fireman is mashed by an imploded womb, like Poe’sflexing “fiery walls.” “My comrades … tenderly lift me forth”: like Queequegdelivering Tashtego from the whale head, Whitman’s firemen pull the poet fromthe cul-de-sac of the maternal body. The scene is a Late Romantic pietà, withWhitman the ritually slain son of the all-mother.Desire is homosexual in Leaves of Grass for the same reason the penis stayssoft: the physical impossibility of mating with the Great Mother, mountainous asBaudelaire’s giantess. The male body is swallowed up in nature’s enormity. Thusthe futility of Whitman’s muscleman shams: the masculine persona he covets isdwarfed to insignificance in his hermaphroditic cosmos, with its abundance andimmensity. As in Swinburne, union is not genital but oral. Whitman consumes hisobject-world, just as he is consumed by it. His poetic style is sexual litany,long pulses of invocation readying the self for invasion by the world-mother whois the world-matter. In form and content, Leaves of Grass has the fluidity ofwomanly Dionysus. “You sea!” the poet cries, “Dash me with amorous wet.” Or in avision worthy of the Bacchae: “Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.”18[ch25_notes.html#ch23note18a] But Whitman is incapable of Maenadic community.His poetry is far more populated than Wordsworth’s, yet he suffers the sameanguished apartness. Like Swinburne’s melancholy Hermaphrodite, he is trapped insexual solitude. His own androgyny, a privilege and a curse, keeps him fromunion with lovers male or female. There is no true intimacy in Whitman. Hispoetry is a substitute for intimacy and a record of the swerve from it.As a sexual persona, solitary, cosmos-creating Whitman is the androgyne I callKhepera, the masturbatory Egyptian First Mover, who also symbolizes the monkish,sexually ambiguous worlds of Aubrey Beardsley and Jean Genet. Sartre could bedescribing Whitman when he says, “Genet is in all his characters, and they areby turns a rose, a dog, a cat, a clematis. He makes himself all of man and allof nature.”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note19a] These three artists are a perverseparadox of fertility and negation. In each, autoerotic imagination flourishes inthe prison of the modern self.Henry James, normally considered a social novelist, is a Decadent Late Romantic,which gives his writing its unique and aggravating character. James criticism istoo adulatory. The result, as with Spenser and Goethe, is the academic censoringof a fantastically perverse imagination. James’s last novels, published earlythis century, belong like Death in Venice to the fin de siècle. No other Englishfiction is so encumbered with Alexandrian ornamentation, the sign of a “late”style. The English social novel, I noted, has few androgynes. James’s sexreversals are a symptom of his covert Romanticism.The most passive James hero appears in The Ambassadors (1903). Lambert Strether,with his spindly, dithery name, is the timid male cowed by dominant women.Thinking of his fiancée, Mrs. Newsome, he recalls the time “when he had held outhis small thirsty cup to the spout of her pail.” She is full, he empty. Mrs.Newsome, a New England grande dame, is a garrulous Muse or bloated teapot, agreat gushing force of phallic personality cascading into his littleness.Strether calls consciousness “a helpless jelly” poured into the “tin mould” oflife.20 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note20a] Such rueful thoughts in James occur onlyto men.James’s figures of speech can be queerly ominous. Talking with friends, Stretherfeels like “the laundress bringing home the triumphs of the mangle.” Woman aswringer: even the laundry is an arena of female triumph of the will. In TheDeath of the Lion, in which two novelists take transsexual pen names, therelation between Mrs. Wimbush and Neil Paraday parallels that between Mrs.Newsome and Strether. “A blind, violent force,” she is “constructed of steel andleather.” He, on the other hand, is of “india-rubber.” Mrs. Wimbush is a brazentotem, a locomotive flattening a doll. She resembles Mrs. Lowder of The Wings ofthe Dove (1902), who is “a projectile, of great size, loaded and ready for use.”Even Mrs. Lowder’s furniture is “so almost abnormally affirmative, soaggressively erect.” She is “the car of Juggernaut,” bristling with “the strangeidols, the mystic excrescences” of her massive furniture. The Jamesian dowageris a slow, crushing diesel, leading with a bosomy prow of grappling hooks. Mrs.Lowder directs dinner conversation as if steering a boat, resuming, “with asplash of her screw, her cruise among the islands.”21[ch25_notes.html#ch23note21a] Manhandling her phallic propeller, the hostessgets under weigh on a floating torture rack—the dinner table as Raft of theMedusa.Women in James have innate authority, while men are in retreat. Merton Densher,the shrinking violet of Wings of the Dove, reflects, “He had thought, no doubt,from the day he was born, much more than he had acted.” Too much thought blursthe male’s definitiveness of self. Densher is subject both to Mrs. Lowder andher bold niece, Kate Croy, to whom he offers “his pure passivity.” He enjoys“mere spectatorship,” while Kate is “the faultless soldier on parade.” He saysof her relishingly, “Ah, she’s very masterful.” The wishy-washy James hero isalways making obsequious verbal genuflections towards his master-mistress.Densher to Kate: “‘You’re prodigious!’ ‘Of course I’m prodigious!’”22[ch25_notes.html#ch23note22a] Such moments border on the distasteful because oftheir flagrant affect, ill-hid by a veil of irony. It’s like a hedgehog rootingabout under a doily. Wilde is more honest in allowing Lady Bracknell andGwendolen to dominate spunky male opponents. James, maneuvering his insipidheroes into reverential attitudes, makes himself a court hermaphrodite, anunctuous flatterer at the queen’s court. His slavishness is another version ofthe cultic reverence of Poe, Baudelaire, and Swinburne for their Romanticvampires.As a sexual persona, the passive male predates James’s Decadent late phase.Sickly Ralph Touchett of The Portrait of a Lady (1881) is geneticallyhalf-feminine: his father was “the more motherly” and his mother “paternal,”even “gubernatorial.” He is “an accidental cohesion of related angles”: “Heshambled, and stumbled, and shuffled, in a manner that denoted great physicalhelplessness.” This maladroit marionette says of his subservience to the pluckyheroine: “Isabel Archer has acted on me—yes; she acts on every one. But I havebeen absolutely passive.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note23a] The Jamesian male putshimself under the influence of female power, like a patient submitting to ahypnotist. He glows only in reflection, the male moon to a female sun. In hislate work, James drops invalidism as an excuse for his heroes’ inertia. Theprotagonist of The Beast in the Jungle (1903) does not marry simply because,like Melville’s Bartleby, he would prefer not to. His virginal modesty is amodern abulia. The Jamesian male, with his urban pallor, is a Bartleby with abank account. Avoiding marriage, he is the opposite of the English Renaissanceandrogynes, who stampede toward the altar. Like Mademoiselle de Maupin, heremains alone to protect his androgyny, but unlike Maupin, he chooses passivityand stasis, female waiting.James’s sadomasochistic scheme also has female victims. Three novels join thetheme of lesbian enthrallment to the humiliation of an unworldly young woman.James has gotten this from Hawthorne’s The Blithedale Romance, whose ancestor isColeridge’s Christabel. Thus Romanticism flows directly into the plotting of hismajor novels. Masterful Isabel Archer is herself mastered by the clever andfascinating Madame Merle, with whom she has a faintly erotic relationship. Merleurges her “to get used to” men in order to “despise them.” The Portrait of aLady has two theatrical moments of domination and submission, based on thevampire epiphanies of Romanticism. First Isabel, entering a drawing room, findsMerle standing and the aesthetical Gilbert Osmond seated, looking up at her.This is a breach of decorum: no gentleman sits while a lady stands. Madame Merleis in command, outside the social frame. The second incident is the novel’sclimactic revelation, where Isabel repeats the subordinate posture.“Who are you—what are you?” Isabel murmured. “What have you to do with myhusband? … What have you to do with me?” …Madame Merle slowly got up, stroking her muff, but not removing her eyes fromIsabel’s face.“Everything!” she answered.Isabel sat there looking up at her, without rising; her face was almost a prayerto be enlightened. But the light of her visitor’s eyes seemed only a darkness.“Oh, misery!” she murmured at last; and she fell back, covering her face withher hands. It had come over her like a high-surging wave that Mrs. Touchett wasright. Madame Merle had married her!24 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note24a]Merle, via Hawthorne, is the vampire Geraldine transfixing the eyes andovercoming the will of kneeling Christabel. Even the suggestive muff-strokingevokes Coleridge’s scene of seduction. “Madame Merle had married her”: in periodparlance, this means Merle secretly arranged Isabel’s marriage, married her off.But in a perverse ambiguity, it also means Merle has made Isabel her own lesbianbride. Their union is on the conspiratorial level of daemonic mentalization,where the vampire triumphs. “Who are you—what are you?” Merle (“blackbird” inFrench) is an emanation of animal night, a Romantic intrusion into a socialnovel.A similar shadowy design governs The Wings of the Dove. Artless Milly Theale isbewitched by her “wondrous” victimizer, Kate Croy, who seems like “a breezyboy.” Milly is preoccupied with Kate’s charismatic beauty. Fending off aproposal from Lord Mark, she suggests he marry Kate instead: “Because she’s thehandsomest and cleverest and most charming creature I ever saw, and because if Iwere a man I should simply adore her. In fact I do as it is.”25[ch25_notes.html#ch23note25a] So Mark is to act as Milly’s proxy in possessingKate. Or is Kate to usurp Milly’s identity by doubling for her in her adultroles?—exactly what Coleridge’s vampire does the morning after the seduction.The most blatant of James’s plots of lesbian bonding and entrapment is TheBostonians (1886), whose debt to The Blithedale Romance is well recognized.Hawthorne’s willful Zenobia has become domineering Olive Chancellor, a feministspinster. Her protegée, Verena Tarrant, is the daughter of a mesmerist, anotherdetail from Hawthorne. Like Merle, Olive is hostile to men, “the brutal,blood-stained, ravening race.” It is in Verena’s nature “to be easilysubmissive, to like being overborne.” She is the psychologically undefendedwoman of pure femininity whom we have met in Spenser, Sade, Blake, Coleridge,and Balzac. Her sexual simplicity is an emptiness attracting predators, male andfemale. I suspect The Bostonians’ power struggle between a rich lesbian and anegotistical lady’s man for a feminine girl comes from Balzac’s The Girl with theGolden Eyes. As in Balzac, the lesbian is a fierce androgyne, her gender inquestion: “What sex was it, great heaven?”26 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note26a]Hawthorne is to James as Poe is to Baudelaire, the transmitter of Coleridge’sdaemonic psychology of sex and power. In no other way could James, a socialnovelist, have come into deep imaginative contact with Coleridge. The socialnovel, I argued, is predicated on control or exclusion of the sexual archetypal,a source of public and private disorder. The sequence Coleridge, Hawthorne,James parallels the sequence Balzac, Baudelaire, Swinburne as a line of descentof lesbian erotica. One lesbian couple is refracted into three beams ofidentity. The sexually ambivalent artist projects himself into the passive girl,corrupted by a dominatrix. Edmund Wilson sees transsexual identification in allJames’s heroines: James’s interest in “immature girls who are objects of desireor defilement” came from a polarization with his brother William in “anopposition of feminine and masculine”: “There was always in Henry James aninnocent little girl whom he cherished and loved and protected and yet whom helater tried to violate, whom he even tried to kill.”27[ch25_notes.html#ch23note27a] What is perverse in James is the obsessiverepetition of this psychodrama. Like Poe, he writes the same story over and overagain. Repetition, imperfect individuation: as in Wuthering Heights, suchblurring of characterization signals the presence of Romanticism.Like Poe’s Red Death, The Bostonians is unique among James’s works in having avirile hero. The pushy Basil Ransom is no Jamesian milquetoast. The lesbianismis also more explicit than in any other novel. The two things are related.Masculinity emerges unimpaired in The Bostonians because of the completenesswith which James has fused with passive Verena. Olive’s unmasked lesbian ardorholds him in his transsexual state, without risk of contamination by maleness.Hence Basil, left to himself, can expand to the limit of his gender. Myarchetypal analysis of The Scarlet Letter and The Minister’s Black Veil wouldsuggest that in The Blithedale Romance Hawthorne has similarly projectedhimself, by sexual metathesis, into the meek maiden who is the object of lesbiandomination. Thus he penetrates into the female magic circle denied him in TheScarlet Letter. Borrowing Hawthorne’s motif for a social novel, James revisesit. In The Blithedale Romance, societyconstructing energies fail, and suicidalZenobia returns to nature, absorbed into the “Black River of Death” with its“weedy and slimy” heart.28 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note28a] But Olive Chancellor isonly an irritable political ideologue whose summery Cape Cod has no connectionto dangerous chthonian nature. James’s transfer of Hawthorne’s lesbian coupleinto a social novel is exactly like Wilde’s ritual purification of Salomé byturning its vampire into the mannered twin androgynes Gwendolen and Cecily. Mytheory again: high comedy is always a defeat of the chthonian. The Bostonians isThe Blithedale Romance dedaemonized. It demonstrates that James’s comedy ofmanners is a strategy of resistance to the perverse Romantic undercurrent inAmerican literature.No James story better shows what must be kept out than The Turn of the Screw(1898). Its literary gamesmanship: Charlotte Brontë’s governess invades theArcadia of a Jane Austen country house, which she disorders with Poe’s obsessiveeroticism. As we shall see, James’s immediate target is The Importance of BeingEarnest, staged three years earlier. Tending a boy and girl of “angelic beauty,”the governess falls under the sway of two daemons of Blakean opacity, who menacethe children’s Apollonian transparency. Peter Quint and Miss Jessel arehomosexual “fiends” returned from the dead, servants turned master in aSaturnalian or rather Saturnian reversal. They exert a leaden, obstructivepressure on the story.29 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note29a]The Turn of the Screw is brilliantly poised between the reality and unreality ofits ghosts. Kenneth Burke says: “The governess’ struggle with the ghosts of herpredecessors for the possession of the children is not sexual, as judged byliteral tests of sexual appetite. But it is ambiguously sexual, a sexualitysurrounded at every point by mystification.” We see “one class struggling topossess the soul of another class,” adult vs. children, “a classification‘prior’ to sex, and leading into the mysteries of ancestor worship.”30[ch25_notes.html#ch23note30a] Ancestors are worshipped to keep their ghosts fromencroaching on the living. Quint and Jessel are Harpies, “Snatchers.” The evilinto which they threaten to abduct the children is more potent for itsvagueness. Their lust is for homosexual capture, not contact. They entice theirvictims into a world of sexual anti-matter. Geoffrey Hartman speaks of James’s“superstitious response to spirit of place.”31 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note31a]Quint and Jessel are malign genii loci, guardians of a territory one may enterbut never leave. By cohabitation rather than blood, they construct an UnholyFamily, a house outside the law. It is a more sinister version of the unsavoryfour-branched ménage into which the densely Jessel-like Madame Merle drawsIsabel Archer.The governess, regent of a realm from which the owner absents himself in godlikeindifference, is a Late Romantic imaginist who creates a psychodrama ofenslavement. As usual in Decadence, the medium of domination is the visual. Inthe first apparition, Quint stands on the crenellated tower, gazing at thegoverness with “a bold hard stare,” too free to belong to a gentleman. In thesecond, he stands outside the window looking in, staring at her with a look“deep and hard.” In the third, “a woman in black, pale and dreadful,” standsacross the lake gazing at little Flora (a Botticellian name). She “fixed” thechild with “awful eyes,” “with a kind of fury of intention.”32[ch25_notes.html#ch23note32a] Jessel’s ocular fixation belongs to Coleridge’svampire. Her gaze is a paralytic intervention in nature, fixing Flora in eerilyprolonged childhood, sexually aging her mind while halting maturation of herbody. The vampire, by sudden hierarchic assertion, projects the white leprosy oftime.The Turn of the Screw’s great planes of eye-contact are one of the mostsensational examples of the tyranny of the visual in French, English, andAmerican Late Romanticism. Quint and Jessel exist not as characters, in anovelistic sense, but as nodes of visibility. They are hieratic personae in acult of the western eye. The womb-tombs of the Gothic tale of terror emptythemselves into the story’s appalling open spaces, with their violent, piercingsightlines. James demonstrates the aggression in the act of western seeing, aniron chain binding person to person in Euclidean triangles. Quint and Jessel’sopacity comes from their intensity of seeing and being seen, which withers themlike Wordsworth’s solitaries or Baudelaire’s crucified poet. They are points ofnegative cathexis, reverse images of the entrancing art-object hierarchs ofSarrasine and Dorian Gray. What is Decadent in Quint and Jessel is their visualconcentration and immobility, their horrifying stillness. They are Coleridgeansaboteurs in Wordsworthian nature. They have the gravity of Emerson’s eyeballand the density of Balzac’s black diamond. They are moral anthracite embedded,like Moreau’s gems, in James’s canvas.Eroticism in The Turn of the Screw takes the frigid form of voyeurism. Quint andJessel practice shamanistic transportation of consciousness, a hovering at theedge of thought. This is a modern magic, produced by Rousseau’s unstable fusionof sexuality and identity. We saw the same hovering in Blake’s sadomasochisticGod Creating Adam and “Infant Joy.” We saw it in the vampire’s hovering outsideChristabel’s castle and in Whitman’s hovering at the bedsides of sleepers. Weshall see it again in the ponderous hovering of James’s late style.The voyeuristic tension of The Turn of the Screw makes sex mentalized, in thefanatical western way. The governess whose psychic space is invaded byeye-potent spectres is the oppressed turned oppressor, hovering in a Gothiccloud over her charges. She imposes a Manichaean duality on the children, whoare torn between heaven and hell. The governess is another Khepera, a cosmogonichermaphrodite exciting herself into autoerotic action. The ghosts may beemanations of her own double-sexed imagination, schizophrenically alienated:rejecting marriage, male and female separate for a homosexual spree. Juxtaposingthese hard dark stars with the children, with “their more than earthly beauty,their absolutely unnatural goodness,” the governess is a Decadent artist,joining moral and aesthetic extremes, evil with beauty, a Beardsleyesque blackand white. Her one theme is the fleur du mal of her “endless obsession.”33[ch25_notes.html#ch23note33a] Like Blake’s beadles with their frozen wands, shekills in order to save, enveloping the children in her mortifying fiction. Aheadstrong hermaphrodite lost in self-pleasuring fantasy at the country house ofan uncle-guardian absent in the city: we have already met James’s governess inWilde’s Cecily Cardew, whose tutor Miss Prism becomes the housekeeper Mrs.Grose. Cecily is Salomé purified of the chthonian. The Turn of the Screwredaemonizes her.34 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note34a]What of the screw of the title? Unwound, it belongs to a spinster with a screwloose. Tightened, it is the nail of excess mental control, splintering society’shierarchical frame, which the governess rigidly reinforces with hersadomasochistic reverie. We know from the aggressive Mrs. Lowder that James’sscrew is a phallic tool of torture. Turning her screw in a vortex or maelstromof pleasure-pain, the governess as deranged Khepera makes love to and fertilizesherself. As in Blake’s Mental Traveller, the rack on which the dominatrixtortures her children is her own body. Interrogating Flora, the governess goesdizzy with nerves, gripping her “with a spasm that, wonderfully, she submittedto without a cry or a sign of fright.” But the governess’ supreme achievement isthe death-by-imagination of the terrorized boy-child Miles, who expires in herimprisoning arms.35 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note35a] Like the witch-queen of SnowWhite, she is the stepmother of fatal embrace. Miles’s Late Romantic love-deathcomes from Poe: Usher’s heart stops when his dying sister collapses on him. Butin James, woman triumphs, dandling the dead male in her personal pietà.The Turn of the Screw is rich in Romantic archetypes. Quint at the window mayrecall Catherine’s ghost at the window in Wuthering Heights. The ghost who can’tget in in Brontë and James finally steps cheerily into the room in Saki’s TheOpen Window, whose malicious fantasist is James’s Flora, now adolescent andpracticing what she learned from her governess. Quint on the tower is acrow-black rook—a castle in chess—who glides from post to post. Jessel is theblack queen surveying the board across sweeping distances. Is this LewisCarroll’s influence? Black rook and queen, stalking the white pawns, pollute thepieties of Romantic childhood. Jessel is always poised by a lake of placidfemale waters. The two fiends subdue both nature and culture.In their icy composure, Quint and Jessel both descend from Coleridge’sGeraldine. “She wants Flora,” says the governess of Jessel. This lesbianpredator is “wonderfully handsome” but “infamous.” She is “dark as midnight inher black dress, her haggard beauty.” Like Geraldine, she is haggard withwatching. In her uncanniest moment, “she rose erect,” a “pale and ravenousdemon,” by the lake. Jessel is Poe’s self-erected Ligeia, who returns in ashroud of hair “blacker than the wings of the midnight.” James is alsoactivating another of Geraldine’s doubles. The governess says of Quint, “He’s ahorror,” and of Jessel, “The woman’s a horror of horrors.”36[ch25_notes.html#ch23note36a] In The Blithedale Romance, the corpse ofHawthorne’s raven-haired Zenobia is pulled from the river with this ironiceulogy: “Six hours before, how beautiful! At midnight, what a horror!”37[ch25_notes.html#ch23note37a] Jessel stands by a lake because she is theresurrected Zenobia, emerging by Ligeian willpower from waters she has quelledto stillness.The Bostonians dedaemonized The Blithedale Romance. But The Turn of the Screw isa great rebirth of the archaic, returning Hawthorne to his Coleridgean source byinfusions of charismatic Late Romantic evil. Published in 1898, it just precedesJames’s late style, exemplified by the three major novels of 1902–04. My theory:the late style’s complexity and impenetrability are a defense against thedangerous outbreak of the daemonic in Turn of the Screw. In this story, themiddleclass country house, the sphere of experience opened by Jane Austen, isswamped by the Romantic and irrational. James’s vocation as a social novelistwas under secret attack by forces of the perverse. He tried to dismiss The Turnof the Screw as a “pot-boiler,” a metaphor that betrays his troubled sense ofits nakedness, its lurid psychic overflow.Now for the late novels. I find the first commentaries on James truer in tonethan the more recent, reverent academic analyses. For example, in 1916 RebeccaWest says, “With sentences vast as the granite blocks of the Pyramids and ascene that would have made a site for a capital he set about constructing astory the size of a hen-house.” She speaks of “those great sentences whichsprawl over the pages of The Golden Bowl with such an effect of rank vegetablegrowth that one feels that if one took cuttings of them one could raise alibrary in the garden.”38 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note38a]Here is a sample cutting from The Golden Bowl (1904). Prince Amerigo is thinkingabout Charlotte Stant: “Nothing in her definitely placed her; she was a rare, aspecial product. Her singleness, her solitude, her want of means, that is herwant of ramifications and other advantages, contributed to enrich her somehowwith an odd, precious neutrality, to constitute for her, so detached yet soaware, a sort of small social capital.”39 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note39a] Nothingdefinitely: we are in limbo. Social novels normally chart social relationships.But James wants Charlotte without relation. Detached, neutral, unramified, shefloats free. James disorients the reader by dimming the spatial andpsychological premises of perception. The character set before us becomes more,not less nebulous, an apparition that we strain to bring into focus but thateludes three-dimensional resolution. Syntax is equally perverse. The prose isself-interrupted by hedging clauses, endless qualifications of Decadentprecision, a pedantry numbing by overabstraction.James has a baffling style. That is, he sets the prose as a baffle or barrierbetween the reader and the thing described. In conversations, what is not saidpresses upon what is. In the late novels, the prose itself exerts this pressure,forcing the reader into submission. There is a taunting obscurantism. Forexample, Strether asks someone, “For what do you suggest that I suppose her totake you?”40 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note40a] This busy mound of supposition, withits stately rotation of points of view, is like an anthill we gingerly steparound. It is three times removed from emotion.People who dislike James are not simpletons impatient with complexity. His claimto explore every mental nuance is false. There is good reason to be repelled byJames’s duplicity and guile, for line by line we are being deflected from whatwe really want to know. His web of qualification is a ruse. Like Penelope, heweaves and unweaves to delude us. We try to enter his world but are checked byan invisible force. The turgidity of the prose is a buzzing background noise orscrim of chalky powder, covering even the print on the page. The self-concealingtechnique reverses that of Blake’s “Infant Joy,” which sucks the daemonizedreader into a burrow or vacuum. The Turn of the Screw is “Infant Joy” writlarge: it is a dream of the ease and horror of psychological invasion. In thelate novels, therefore, James’s systematic exclusion of the reader is crucial tohis defense against the daemonic.James has a reputation as a psychologist. Yes, he records internal events, buthis psychological insights are not particularly abundant. James is monotonous.His characters’ inner lives are poorly personalized. There is only oneconsciousness, his own. Saying James has “a very short list of characters,”Forster makes the kind of remark I value from early commentary: “Maimedcreatures can alone breathe in Henry James’s pages—maimed yet specialized. Theyremind one of the exquisite deformities who haunted Egyptian art in the reign ofAkhenaton—huge heads and tiny legs, but nevertheless charming.”41[ch25_notes.html#ch23note41a] James’s world is populated by a small nuclearfamily in claustrophobic proximity. Even travel to Europe is another closure.Open any novel at random: who is being talked about? We grope about, at a loss.Names are rare. James likes luxurious misty rowings through he, she, you, I. Asin Emerson, there is a limitation on personae. James’s novels are Romanticfamily romance. His internal world is a compromise between social reality andthe preconscious realm of imagination and archetype into which Romanticismdescends.James describes states of waiting. He seeks fullness, retention, rumination inthe bovine sense. The unexpressed is an edemic engorgement, a male pregnancywithout issue. Wilde, who did not even live to see the final novels, said, “Mr.Henry James writes fiction as if it were a painful duty.”42[ch25_notes.html#ch23note42a] Reading late James is like swimming upstream. Theprose resists us with its weight and opacity, its “dizzying, smothering welter”(a phrase from The Golden Bowl).43 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note43a] In his Romanticwithdrawal from masculinity, James wraps each act or remark in an immobilizingsheath of excess words. He sadistically imposes a sense of frustration andentrammelment on the reader. The prose is the medium but not the message. Itreproduces the density of ambiguous circumstance in which the characters arecaught. It is a large, humming, hovering mass.Not everything in James is artistically intelligible. As astream-of-consciousness writer, he is quite unlike Proust or Woolf in the vaguemenace we feel in his situations. He has a Late Romantic disease of unease. Thecumbersome tapestry of his writing is fouled with catches or snarls. When herfather refers to her “duty,” Kate Croy’s “tired smile watched the word as if ithad taken on a small grotesque visibility.”44 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note44a] Iwill argue that grotesque visibility is one of James’s primary techniques. Thedense swaying mass of his prose rouses itself into tottering apexes of metaphor,in the late novels increasingly bizarre and sensational. I called the ghosts ofTurn of the Screw nodes of visibility. The metaphors are the same thing in newform.James’s grotesque metaphors are Decadent tropes of moral and sexual ambiguity.Milly Theale thinks of her relation to her doctor as “something done up in thesoftest silk and tucked away under the arm of memory.” Memory, hardly likely tobe parading about with silkstuffs under her arm, is a recumbent goddess—aDecadent corpse laid out in lavender. Milly thinks of pity holding up “itstell-tale face like a head on a pike, in a French revolution, bobbing before awindow.”45 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note45a] We are to imagine some sleepy Parisianstay-at-home looking up from a book to see a guillotined head dancing outside.Pity, paternalized, is hostile, an evil portent. It is a grinningjack-in-the-box, a grisly fleur du mal of phallic elasticity. We have seen thishead at the window before. By her sadomasochistic reverie, mild Milly Thealerevives the stalking daemon Peter Quint of The Turn of the Screw.Kate Croy’s father declares, “If I offer you to efface myself, it’s for thefinal, fatal sponge that I ask, well saturated and well applied.”46[ch25_notes.html#ch23note46a] Fatal sponges are refugees from horror films. Croyis seeing himself as a self-cleaning blackboard. But the sponge “applied” to himsounds like a sticky poultice or leech. He seems to be inviting the obliteratingcontact of his daughter’s slavering lips!—a filial kiss of death. He is thecrucified one to whom bystanders extend a sour, unnourishing sponge. “Final,fatal sponge” also echoes the formula “final, fatal plunge” by which tabloidspicture the defenestration of suicides. The comic Jamesian metaphor is a studdedconglomerate of sadomasochistic meanings.An exchange between Madame de Vionnet and Strether: “The golden nail she hadthen driven in pierced a good inch deeper.” The worldly Vionnet is both aninquisitor of the crucified male heroine and a guest dignitary punctuating therabble-made railroad with its final golden spike. Conversation with a dominatrixis like playing jackstraws with razors. Mrs. Newsome’s daughter sums up herbrother’s relation to her: “Treating her handsomely buttered no parsnips; andthat in fine there were moments when she felt the fixed eyes of their admirableabsent mother fairly screw into the flat of her back.”47[ch25_notes.html#ch23note47a] Parsnips make language an indigestible lump,intensifying the concreteness of the second metaphor, where a matriarch againoperates her hermaphroditic screw—here an arrowlike auger launched from theeerily “fixed eyes” of a telepathic goddess.The Golden Bowl likes fowl metaphors. Birds bruise themselves against glass orflutter in traps improbably set in roads. There are visual puns: “A scruple inMaggie raised its crest.” The scruple is both army flag and cock’s comb. Instress, Maggie’s emotions undergo internal erection. The Golden Bowl, befittingits title, uses metaphors of containment. Of Fanny Assingham and the Prince:“She found his eloquence precious; there was not a drop of it that she didn’t,in a manner, catch, as it came, for immediate bottling, for future preservation.The crystal flask of her innermost attention really received it on the spot, andshe had even already the vision of how, in the snug laboratory of herafterthought, she should be able chemically to analyze it.”48[ch25_notes.html#ch23note48a] Here we see how James purifies Romantic archetypesby rationalizing or overliteralizing them. The passage dedaemonizes Blake’sMental Traveller. Fanny’s crystal flask is the gold cup in which the vampirecatches the shrieks of her male victim. (The novel’s biblical title occurs inBlake’s Book of Thel.) The femme fatale becomes a scientist and bottler ofmineral waters. But in the laboratory of her consciousness, as on Blake’s anvilof nature, she is a sexual dissecter, subdividing male matter. She is also aDecadent cultist, for her flask is like a consecrated vial holding lacrimaeChristi, the Prince’s “precious” falling words.The nesting female cubicles of flask and laboratory recur in Maggie’suncomfortable sense of her husband and stepmother’s attitude toward her: “Theyhad built her in with their purpose—which was why, above her, a vault seemedmore heavily to arch; so that she sat there, in the solid chamber of herhelplessness, as in a bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her, over thebrim of which she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck.”49[ch25_notes.html#ch23note49a] Roman landmarks are fatal to James heroines, inDaisy Miller the Colosseum and here the Baths of Caracalla. Sunk in asarcophaguslike tub, Maggie is trapped in a Piranesi prison. She is part Aida,part Poe’s bricked-up Fortunato. James’s metaphors are mini-tableaux of LateRomantic torture. The bath, like Fanny’s flask, is a mental vessel brimming withthe waters of consciousness. In James, the inner life is feminine because liquidand malleable. Thus it makes sense that his thought-stymied heroes areandrogynous. The gelatins of consciousness usually elude male control. Mrs.Lowder is a master chef: “‘Why’ was the trivial seasoning-substance, the vanillaor the nutmeg, omittable from the nutritive pudding without spoiling it.”50[ch25_notes.html#ch23note50a] As chemist or cook, woman does the whipping.James’s grotesque metaphors are the objets or curios of his Decadentaestheticism. Like Wilde, he joins Late Romantic sexual perversity to Englishhigh comedy of Carrollian absurdity. The link between his metaphors andart-obsessed French Decadence is clear in the comparison of Maggie Verver’stroubled married life to “some wonderful, beautiful, but outlandish pagoda.” Its“great decorated surface” is plated with fancy porcelain and hung with silverbells.51 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note51a] The pagoda metaphor, taking up a fullpage, is so long and tangled that, as West tartly remarks, “one is left with aconfused impression that a pagoda formed part of the furniture at Portland Placeand that Maggie oddly elected to keep her husband inside it.”52[ch25_notes.html#ch23note52a] James’s exercise in Orientalism is a display ofDecadent connoisseurship. The pagoda is an epic simile from which nature hasbeen banished. As an objet d’art, its antecedents are not in the social novelbut in Moreau and Huysmans.James’s metaphors are points of grotesque visibility in the diffuse mass of thelate style. Since so much in him is invisible and unspoken, the pricklymetaphors have a violent distinctness. His mandarinism, mussing itself withbuttered parsnips, scattered feathers, and fatal sponges, plunges up and down,in radical rhetorical shifts. The metaphors are tiny psychodramas of sexualfall. The celibate James plays with sensations of seduction and surrender. Themetaphors symbolize his own abasement before female power. His giddy drops fromone level of decorum to another, like a speed jockey operating an elevator, arelike the governess’ delirious self-stimulations in Turn of the Screw.James’s Decadent autoeroticism is shown by his fondness for sexually suggestivenames, all the lewder for the sedate context: Fanny Assingham, Ralph Touchett,Mrs. Condrip. The names, like the metaphors, have a knotty, self-isolatingcharacter. In the late novels, James tries, by subtle insinuations, to inducesexual misreadings of the text. For example, during an innocuous social exchangein The Ambassadors, he speaks of the “lubrication of their intercourse bylevity.” Milly Theale after learning of her fatal illness: “It was as if she hadhad to pluck off her breast, to throw away, some friendly ornament, a familiarflower, a little old jewel, that was part of her daily dress; and to take up andshoulder as a substitute some queer defensive weapon, a musket, a spear, abattle-axe—conducive possibly in a higher degree to a striking appearance, butdemanding all the effort of the military posture.”53[ch25_notes.html#ch23note53a] The soldier talk encourages us to see Milly, in aflare-up of Amazonism, tearing off her breast!—when she is just unpinning abrooch or corsage. James’s late style subjects the reader to Decadent seductionand corruption. Language is perversely eroticized, then yanked back to safety bythe conjurer’s hand, leaving us aroused and guilty.The grotesque metaphors are traps, decoys set to take the reader’s eye. James’sworst feature is his suppression of affect or smothering of reaction. He shunscathartic release because he writes melodrama, not tragedy. His heroines neverhave a true anagnorisis because the moral fault is never in themselves, only inoutside conspirators. The climactic revelations never release the accumulatedtension because they too, like the metaphors, are agents of concealment. Page bypage, the metaphors are sharp points of visibility that, like a matador’s cape,make the reader lunge past a protected center. Their function is to pretendsomething is being revealed, when it is not. The metaphors are apotropaia, likethe ugly gorgoneion hung on the oven door to ward off evil spirits. The reader,both invited guest and intruder, is lured and misled. We are pulled into alabyrinth or meander, then left in the dark. James dissolves the sexual body anddiverts its materiality into the metaphors, which take on a crazy, leeringexactitude. They are sexual displacements, erotic proxies. If, as Wilson thinks,James projects himself into his heroines, then anything that turns us away fromthe body is comprehensible: what the prose is concealing is James himself,transvestized.The obscure late style is itself a sexual projection, for whenever I labor underits enormous constraints, I think, “Someone is there.” Who lingers at theperiphery of narrative?—just like the daemons of Turn of the Screw. James saysIsabel Archer’s reputation for reading “hung about her like the cloudy envelopeof a goddess in an epic.” Bossy Mrs. Lowder also has a charismatic aura: herinterlocutor’s mind is filled with “a cloud of questions out of which MaudManningham’s large seated self loomed,” like “an oracle.”54[ch25_notes.html#ch23note54a] Mrs. Lowder, given her Amazonian maiden name,Manningham (cf. the maiden name of Hawthorne’s mother), is a Pythoness enthronedlike Ingres’s Jupiter. The cloud wrapping her and Isabel is an emanation offemale power. It is identical to the haziness of James’s late style.That style is a miasma, a new version of the female swamp of generation. Socialnovels take place in civilized space marked off from nature. When nature enters,it is usually in socialized form. For example, Isabel, in a hotel in Rome, sitsalone “in a wilderness of yellow upholstery.” This is one of the hostileenvironments, like Spenser’s grove of animate trees, through which the heroinemust make her way. Like Wilde, James recasts nature as interior décor. Hismiasma, still recognizably chthonian, first appears in Daisy Miller: it is thefatal infection Daisy contracts during her picturesque night in the Colosseum.The story, to my happy surprise, actually describes the Colosseum’s “historicatmosphere” as “a villainous miasma.”55 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note55a] DaisyMiller is one of James’s early and stylistically transparent works. The noxiousswampy realm into which the heroine wanders is, I maintain, his late style inutero.James’s late style is a Byzantine fabric of shuddering grandeur. Laden with thisopulent burden, reader and narrative are condemned to slow funereal walking, thetiny steps of an Asiatic priestess—or of a nineteenth-century matron heavy withsocial status and luxuriant skirts. The mental image of one of Isabel’s suitorshas “a kind of bareness and bleakness” because it lacks “the social draperywhich muffles the sharpness of human contact.”56 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note56a]James’s muffling social drapery is female fabric hung between persons to preventhuman contact. The mother’s robes are materialized in his massy, ponderousstyle.James’s world, we have seen, is ruled by women. With a few slick exceptions, menare limited, subordinate, or ludicrous. The mother herself presses turgidly onthe late novels, a paralyzing biographical force whom James both resists andadores. We feel her hovering in his ornate style. Donning a prose of femaledrapery, he unites with the mother through ritual impersonation. The son-loverof the goddess commits incest through his hieratic, hermaphrodized language. Butthis holy marriage is full of danger. James says of Prince Amerigo and hismistress, “The intensity both of the union and the caution became a workablesubstitute for contact.”57 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note57a] Everywhere in James, wefeel an unsettling caution. The writer of the late novels is like Condorcetdisguised as a girl by his mother in order, according to Frazer, to foil theevil eye. In James, the mother herself is the evil eye. She protects him fromthe daemonic, loaning him her clothing, in the aegis-form of the late style, asa defense against the spectres of Turn of the Screw. But she is also the channelof the daemonic, through which man is crushed and humiliated by nature. James’sunion with the mother is an imprisonment that we, oppressed by his style, share.She prevents him from fully entering the world of personae. He is detained byher in a median state, halfway between Romanticism and the social novel, hisartistic goal. So we wait—and wait and wait. Nothing ever happens in James,because he and we are hostages caught in a crossfire.James’s repressions and evasions are many, varied, and exhausting. Why morepeople are not seen rushing shrieking from libraries, shredded James novels intheir hands, I cannot say. I used to wonder whether enthusiasm for him was basedon identification, since his passive, tentative heroes resemble many academics.Perhaps what is intolerable is his enshrinement in a soporific criticism. Somuch must be overlooked to crown him with laurel. But if James is understood asa Late Romantic, a Decadent in my extended sense, then his sadomasochisticperversities take coherent form, integrated with his witty aestheticism andambiguous sexual personae. His fussy late style is Decadent because it is bothfastidious and excessive. George Moore called James a self-made “eunuch,”implying he was a prude and sissy.58 [ch25_notes.html#ch23note58a] This is muchtoo simple. Sex cannot be understood apart from nature. James’s rhetoricalimpediments and frustrations arise from a suppression of the daemonic, in whichsex is included but to which sex too is subject."},{"pageContent":"24AMHERST’S MADAME DE SADEEmily DickinsonAmerican Romanticism, I have argued, is really Decadent Late Romanticism, thecentury-long evolution through which Coleridge finally triumphs over Wordsworth.Poe and Hawthorne are already registering Late Romantic perversities in the1830s. Therefore the tardy dates of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Huckleberry Finn(1884) show what is wrong with Mark Twain. His Wordsworthian idylls arecompletely out of sync with the internal development of major Americanliterature. The two books are bourgeois fantasies about childhood andlower-class life. As in my youth, teachers continue to inflict them on studentsas somehow proper reading. It took me twenty years to work out a critical theoryto explain why I found Twain so hateful. His dislike of the witty Jane Austenprovided the key. His rejection of her Enlightenment hierarchism is partly anunconscious rejection of the innate hierarchism of Late Romanticism. Twain istrying to turn the Romantic clock back. His folksiness and pastoralism arecounterfeit, as decadent as Marie Antoinette’s masquerades as a shepherdess. Thegloomy negativity of Twain’s later life is no puzzle to me. His Wordsworthianbenevolence was always false. The hierarchical Lewis Carroll is the true poet ofchildhood, with its mystery, cruelty, and blatant aggressions. Twain as afabulist? Fable is marshallow myth; it is myth stripped of chthonian realities.Scratch a fabulist, and you’ll find fear of woman and fear of nature.Storytelling or yarn-spinning is what men do among men. It is a ritual ofavoidance, a deflection of the psychological turbulence of men’s lives withwomen. Twain’s boy-stories are songs of innocence sixty years past their time.Romanticism is in its degenerate late phase. Dark, sexual songs of experienceare the authentic Late Romantic voice. And this leads us to Emily Dickinson, thegreatest of women poets.Less melodious than Sappho, Dickinson is conceptually vaster, for sheassimilates two more millennia of western experience. No major figure inliterary history has been more misunderstood. Ignored by her own time, Dickinsonwas sentimentalized in her renascence. After thirty years of scholarship, themodernist complexity of her high style is universally recognized. But criticismstill ignores the bulk of mawkish lyrics in her collected works. There is nointegration of her high and low styles. Psychoanalytic readings are slowlymaking their way, but the academic view of her remains too genteel. Thehorrifying and ruthless in her are tempered or suppressed. Emily Dickinson isthe female Sade, and her poems are the prison dreams of a self-incarcerated,sadomasochistic imaginist. When she is rescued from American Studies departmentsand juxtaposed with Dante and Baudelaire, her barbarities and diabolical acts ofwill become glaringly apparent. Dickinson inherits through Blake the rape cycleof the The Faerie Queene. Blake and Spenser are her allies in helping paganColeridge defeat Protestant Wordsworth.The primary qualities of Dickinson’s style are high condensation and riddlingellipsis. Protestant hymn-measure is warped and deformed by a stupefying energy.Words are rammed into lines with such force that syntax shatters and collapsesinto itself. The relation of form to content is aggressive and draconian. Thestructure cramps and pinches the words like a vise. The poems shudder with ahuge tremor of contraction. Dickinson’s poetry is like the shrinking room ofPoe’s The Pit and the Pendulum, a torture chamber and arena of extremity. We arein the womb-tomb of Decadent closure.Dickinson has two representational modes, which I call the Sadean and theWordsworthian. The brutality of this belle of Amherst would stop a truck. She isa virtuoso of sadomasochistic surrealism: “The Brain, within its Groove / Runsevenly and true— / But let a Splinter swerve.”1 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note1a]Like the Metaphysical poets, she finds metaphors among the mechanical anddomestic arts—blacksmithing, carpentry, cooking, sewing. In this example, thebrain, detached as Emerson’s eyeball, is humming merrily along in itsunderground railroad of daily custom, when it is suddenly pierced by a splintershooting off the wooden track. Analysts of emotion do not normally think of thebrain as a soft mass spitted by malicious barbs. As in James, the metaphorbelongs to horror films—or rotisserie cooking. It always reminds me of abreakfast-hour high-school driver-education film that made us contemplate a deadtruck driver, his skull crushed against the dashboard by a load of lumbershifting forward. The analogies in art to Dickinson’s wood-speared brain arepagan or Catholic: the Iliad’s gruesome battlefield deaths or Mantegna’s St.Sebastian, transfixed by an arrow from chin to pate. In its sheergratuitousness, the metaphor resembles the tortures of 120 Days of Sodom, whereSade jams lethal blades, rods, and spikes into every orifice of the body.Dickinson prefers the word “brain” to “mind”: it is one of her earthyAnglo-Saxon tropes. She makes sharp Sadean comedy out of treating the brain as athing: “The Brain is just the weight of God— / For Heft them Pound for Pound /And they will differ—if they do— / As Syllable from Sound” (632). The poet heftsthe brain like a shopper picking through cabbages at the market. God has shrunk,like the embalmed head of Queequeg’s totem. The poet sets him on the makeshiftscales of human judgment. It’s suppertime: communion or cannibalism? Bereaved,Dickinson declares, “I’ve dropped my Brain” (1046). Thought is paralyzed, withthe brain dropped like a handkerchief. But such an object will hardly float tothe floor. We hear a muffled thump, like the paperboy hitting the stoop with theevening edition.Dickinson’s brain has a will of its own: “If ever the lid gets off my head / Andlets the brain away / The fellow will go where he belonged / Without a hint fromme” (1727). The skull seems trepanned, like a cookie jar. The brain, asmasculine intellect, escapes like a canary from a cage or a firefly from abottle. We see a Late Romantic rebellion of part against whole, the brain boldlyabandoning its master, like Gogol’s nose or Gautier’s mummified foot. The braincan be an empty, echoing space: “I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, / And Mournersto and fro / Kept treading—treading—till it seemed / That Sense was breakingthrough” (280). This parade of persons trampling up and down like noisy upstairsneighbors is a funeral procession of thoughts of wintry disillusion. It is alsothe beating of a Romantically self-oppressed heart. I suspect two influenceshere from Poe: the skull-like mansion/tomb of The House of Usher and theguiltily throbbing chamber of The Tell-Tale Heart.2 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note2a]In “He fumbles at your Soul,” probably an account of a fire-breathing sermon,the hearer’s recovering brain is said “to bubble Cool” (315). So the brain hasbeen boiling like a pot on the stove. The liquefied brain, steaming like magmain a crater, can also be the bonehead brain:Rearrange a “Wife’s” affection!When they dislocate my Brain!Amputate my freckled Bosom!Make me bearded like a man!  [1737]The brain has joints, subject to hoodlum arm-twisting. This stanza, from themarriage poems where Dickinson plays with earthly and celestial brides, is aviolent fantasy of Amazonian desexing. Who are “they”? No matter what reading wechoose, we are left with a spectacle of Sadean torture. The speaker is amartyred saint, St. Catherine racked by the deputies of the state.Enough of brains. On to lungs. “A Small Leech on the Vitals— / The sliver, inthe Lung— / The Bung out of an Artery— / Are scarce accounted Harms” (565). Theleech is not a medical bloodsucker but a septic invader, an intestinal parasite.It is Dickinson’s Sadean shorthand for a nagging anxiety, an invisiblehemorrhaging wound, like a stress ulcer. Its ancestor is Prometheus’ perforatedliver. But the scene of suffering is domestic, not sublime. The leech isheaven’s worm, cousin to Eden’s serpent. The ailment of which the speakercomplains, or rather declines to complain, is chronic rather than acute, agnawing malady without High Romantic glamour.As for the artery with its bung out, Dickinson sees the body bursting like astoven barrel, gushing red in an apoplectic spout. The sliver in the lung isanother of her bits of embedded shrapnel. It is unlikely the sliver has beeninhaled—though one cannot dismiss any hallucination when reading Dickinson!Probably the sliver is a dart that has pierced the rib cage: it is one ofCupid’s unlucky iron arrows, the spear in Christ’s side lowered to householdaccident. Dickinson elsewhere says of an absent friend: “I got so I could stirthe Box / In which his letters grew / Without that forcing, in my breath— / AsStaples driven through” (293). Staples hammered into the thorax are her tenderway of describing a catch in the breath, by which we should also understand thesliver in the lung. Returning to that stanza, we see how much irrational visualmaterial it contains. The speaker stands with bungs out and leeches andsplinters all over her body, like a human porcupine. The representational styleis Asiatic. As in the platform scene of The Scarlet Letter, we see the EphesianArtemis, an idol studded with grotesque sacrificial symbols.Dickinson’s sadomasochistic metaphors are usually overdetermined, in theFreudian sense; that is, they are conflations of multiple meanings. Forinstance, the disagreeable staple occurs elsewhere, showing its inheritedassociations. “They” ally once more for bouts of harassment. “They put Us farapart … They took away our Eyes … They summoned Us to die— / With sweet alacrity/ We stood upon our stapled feet— / Condemned but just to see” (474). Thestapled feet of the devoted couple represent their separation in space. Feetnailed to the ground, the speaker is like Odysseus bound to the mast or like aKewpie doll stuck to a dashboard, swaying to the motion of cathexis. The sceneis Inquisitional: two prisoners are slain for their fidelity. The speaker islike Oedipus, his ankles pierced by the jealous king, or like Christ nailed upwith his criminal companions. The phrase “stapled feet” is purposefullyreductive in making the carpenter’s son victim of a satiric carpentry. Jesus ascarpenter often appears in Dickinson: he is master of “the Art of Boards,” orGod forces him and humanity to walk the plank.3 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note3a]Dickinson strews puncture wounds liberally through her poetry. She says of oneof her heroes, “Fate … Impaled Him on Her fiercest stakes” (1031). Fiercest maymean sharpest, but it could also mean bluntest, to maximize pain. In this savagetableau, a cruel goddess waits with a sheaf of stationary spears, nature’sphallic stockade. Elsewhere Dickinson declares, “No Rack can torture me”: thesoul is something “You Cannot prick with saw / Nor pierce with Scimitar” (384).These negatives are a paraleipsis: what cannot be done to the soul can be doneto the body. Piercing with scimitars is credible swordplay (though slashingwould be truer), but what of pricking with saws? Bizarre scenarios flash beforethe eyes: magicians tickling ladies in half; seamstresses pricking themselveswith saws rather than pins; bandits setting upon travellers with saws, prickingforearms with abandon. Again one thinks of Sade’s encyclopedic 120 Days ofSodom: by Yankee ingenuity, Dickinson is determined to add to the sum total ofimaginable human tortures.Impalement is Dickinson’s metaphor for mortality: “A single Screw of Flesh / Isall that pins the Soul” (263). Incarnation is torment. The soul, like the Greekwinged psyche, is a butterfly fixed by a pin. The cruel lepidopterist, oneassumes, is God. The metaphor recalls Mary’s heart lanced by the swords of herseven sorrows, or St. Teresa’s heart thrilled by the angel’s dart. It is aValentine’s card by Beardsley, a holiday symbolism evoked when Dickinson says ofa friend, “The largest Woman’s Heart / Could hold an Arrow too” (309).Dickinson’s impalements are even more atrocious: “It is simple, to ache in theBone, or the Rind— / But Gimlets among the nerve / Mangle daintier—terribler”(244). Gimlets among the nerve are stabs or twinges of pain, a spiritualneuralgia. But the metaphor demands we see boring tools, like corkscrews,rioting through and shredding the nerve fibers. It is like a butcheringsurgeon’s scalpel or a drunken sculptor’s auger. What is a dainty mangling? ThisDecadent juxtaposition of beauty and horror resembles Baudelaire’s “hideousdelicacies.” It is a subliminally sexual Spenserian effect that few Englishpoets attempt. The “rind,” opposed to bone, is human skin. Normally, only fruit,cheese, or bacon has a rind. Dickinson’s rind makes the body peelable. Apollowith a potato parer, she flays the Marsyas of humanity, exposing raw nerve. Manis a red-ribboned écorché in her laboratory.The spectacles of affliction can be incoherent: “A Weight with Needles on thepounds— / To push, and pierce, besides— / That if the Flesh resist the Heft— /The puncture coolly tries” (264). Like tourists in Madame Tussaud’s Chamber ofHorrors, we pause puzzled before a new instrument of torture in Dickinson’smental dungeon. A weight with needles must be depression combined with anxiety.It is grief that deadens but thoughts that arouse. The metaphor makes us see akind of meat tenderizer or serrated millstone. Perhaps it comes from The Pit andthe Pendulum: it combines crushing with cutting, moving walls with rockingrazorblade. Or it may be a version of the medieval Iron Maiden, which drovespikes into a victim’s eyes and torso. There is a shadowy sexual element inDickinson’s image, a suggestion of rape, for the weight with needles is a forcethat both smothers and penetrates.If she treats the body like a pincushion, Dickinson also treats pincushions likebodies. She speaks of a grief “that nestled close / As needles ladies softlypress / To Cushions Cheeks— / To keep their place” (584). Women darning orembroidering stick needles into the cushions on which they rest their hands. Iftheir sewing is like a book being read, the needle is a bookmark. Dickinson’santhropomorphism fiendishly makes cushions fat-cheeked sentient beings, like thepaunchy pudding whom Alice tries to slice. The stanza clearly shows howDickinson’s sadomasochism is a perverse self-pleasuring. She turns ladies intosadists, ruthlessly running needles into cheeks. “Softly” has a morbidSpenserian delicacy, introducing a luxurious stillness and amorousness into thesequestered scene. We peer into another rounded capsule of female solipsism, asin Blake’s “Sick Rose” or Ingres’s Turkish Bath. The needles are the thorns of aclosed garden of earthly delights.A similar poem describes the rise and fall of a painted hot-air balloon:The Gilded Creature strains—and spins—Trips frantic in a Tree—Tears open her imperial Veins—And tumbles in the Sea—  [700]By making the balloon feminine, Dickinson intensifies the masochism of itsdeath. Its thrashings become exquisite and erotic. Beauty and pain sensuallymix, as in Spenser’s episode of the slashing of Amoret’s white bosom. The word“gilded” gives the balloon the same aura Balzac uses in The Girl with the GoldenEyes to sensationalize the destruction of a human objet d’art. The balloon“strains,” “spins,” “trips frantic”: we are watching the hopeless flight of avictim of rape-murder. Her veins are “torn” like silk, ravaged by vandals. Theveins are imperial, because she is like a Roman opening her veins in the bath ofthe sky-blue sea. Is Dickinson reimagining Shakespeare’s Spenserian Rape ofLucrece? The balloon’s rupture is an orgasmic sigh of surrender.Dickinson’s displaced eroticism is evident even in poems without overt sexualpersonae: “Force Flame / And with a Blonde push / Over your impotence / FlitsSteam” (854). The images have a stunning economy and toughness. She means man ishelpless before nature’s laws. The locution “a Blonde push” is so remote fromcommon English speech that it seems nonverbal, something seen or felt ratherthan read or heard. It has sexual implications, like Yeats’s inseminating “whiterush” in “Leda and the Swan.” We expect a blonde push in French boudoir paintingor Baroque sculpture—Bernini’s Apollo chasing Daphne. The passage is structuredby a hierarchical pattern of strength and weakness, attack and defeat.Another example of Dickinson sex and violence: “She dealt her pretty words likeBlades— / How glittering they shone— / And every One unbared a Nerve / Orwantoned with a Bone” (479). A daunting woman—one suspects she is young andattractive—is set before us, her mouth bristling with steel cutlery, the longteeth of a talkative Berenice. She is making those cutting remarks I findsymptomatic of aggressive western speech. Both coy and cruel, this composedhermaphrodite entertains herself with a round of exploratory surgery, uncoveringnerves and “wantoning” with bones—an erotic word choice. Literally, to wantonwith bones is to toss them about, as if mixing a salad. So we see bones sailingthrough the air on gusts of chat. Are we at a social circus? Juggler,knife-thrower, and lion-tamer have gotten their acts together, in impressivetriplicate.A parallel theme from the poet’s point of view: “I’ve got an arrow here. /Loving the hand that sent it/I the dart revere” (1729). The arrow is probably ahurtful letter that has struck home. Drawing the missile from her flesh andstudying it fondly, the poet is like a martyr holding her instrument ofexecution, like St. Lawrence leaning on his grill. Dickinson’s iconography ofsuffering, with its sexualized pleasure-pain, Catholicizes austere AmericanProtestantism. Imagistically, her poetry is late-phase Renaissance. Metaphysicalpoetry is an anti-Puritan Baroque style, Italian in its passion andtheatricality. Dickinson’s lurid metaphors are surprise renovations, polychromestatues and stained-glass windows added to a white New England church.Dickinson favors emblematic postures where she holds some weapon. Rehashing “aWithdrawn Delight / Affords a Bliss like Murder— / Omnipotent—Acute.” Hence “Wewill not drop the Dirk / Because We love the Wound / The Dirk Commemorate”(379). The dirk must be a letter, or the memory of a letter, and the withdrawndelight its cancellation of a longed-for visit. Dagger in hand, the poetcontemplates the stigmata of her private cult. To “love the Wound” in solitudeis patently autoerotic. The tone is French Decadent: Baudelaire too says, “I amthe wound and the knife!” And what of murder as “bliss”? Dickinson is in herSadean phase, a blood-red moon of sexual will.The poet’s heart is vulnerable to sudden attack by projectiles other thanarrows. She calls springtime birdsong both sad and sweet because it reminds usof the dead: “An ear can break a human heart / As quickly as a spear, / We wishthe ear had not a heart / So dangerously near” (1764). Wham! Chop! Faster than aspeeding spear, the Dickinson ear demolishes a hapless heart, which is like apiece of liver hewn by the cook’s cleaver. Ear and heart, spotlit, secede fromthe body and turn on each other. Normally passive and receptive, the ear becomesactive and aggressive. Like Samson’s jawbone, Dickinson’s feisty ear is amonghistory’s more exotic arms of war. One pictures battalions marching on eachother, brandishing ears rather than spears.That Dickinson does imagine the heart as an extracted organ quivering on a flatsurface is proved by this stanza, which she attached to a gift of fruit:My Heart upon a little PlateHer Palate to delightA Berry or a Bun, would be,Might it an Apricot!  [1027]Wearing her heart on her sleeve would be too conventional for our poet, whoslaps it on a fruit dish and sends it down the street like a phoneorder pizza.Spenser again: Dickinson is remembering Amoret’s heart laid in a silver basin.Obviously, the female friend honored with the poet’s crimson gift is expected tonibble on it, like a chocolate heart on Valentine’s Day. More Catholiciconography: Dickinson is like St. Philip Neri holding his flaming heart in hishand or St. Lucy offering us her eyeballs on a silver platter (a real statue inmy baptismal church).Dickinson indulges her taste for saintly epiphany in clever allegories that slipby the unwary reader. For example, she disdains pearls and jewels since “theEmperor / With Rubies pelteth me” (466). This is one of her tricky bride ofChrist poems: the emperor is the deity whose motives are always suspect. Therubies pelting the speaker are not rich gifts but stones making her bleed. Sheis spotted with her own wounds, a pox or king’s evil by which she is made royal.The emperor is Poe’s Red Death. The jewels are drops of blood, which sheelsewhere forces a friend to number like rosary beads (“But He must count thedrops—himself; 663). She is Danae whom God showers with her own blood and MaryMagdalene at whom he casts the first stone. Dickinson, nouveau pauvre, is anostentatious flaunter of injuries. She says of sunset’s red light, “I feltmartial stirrings / Who once the Cockade wore” (152). The rosette of theNapoleonic veteran becomes a bandage with a bloodstain seeping through (cf. “TheSoul has Bandaged moments”; 512). Dickinson’s wounds and scars are militarymedals of honor, the price and prize of life experience.Back to our catalog of Sadean abuses of the body. We saw brains and lungsundergoing rough treatment at Dickinson’s hands, and this led to a list ofimpalements and ruptures. Eyes are next. I cited “They took away our Eyes,”which means two persons have been forcibly separated and are now invisible toeach other. But in Dickinson’s eccentric dramaturgy, the authorities comeknocking, seize the eyes, and carry them away, like a finance companyrepossessing a refrigerator. This is clear in a poem about the domesticaftermath of death, “When eyes … are wrenched / By Decalogues away” (485). Herethe eyes may have put up a struggle, and death has had to yank them out liketeeth. Like the dislocated brain, this may be another surreal joint, wrenchedlike an elbow. The haste with which the eyes are snatched recalls Perseusrobbing the Graiai. The thief is God, author of the Ten Commandments, whodecrees death as man’s fate. As Dickinson puts it, however, the Decalogue seemsgreedy on its own behalf. Moses’ tablets snap shut on the eyes like a mousetrap.A frequent Dickinson formula is eyes being “put out,” as in “Before I got my eyeput out / I liked as well to see” (327). This may refer to her own visionproblems or her self-sequestration in her second-floor bedroom. But it has aninnuendo of criminal mischief, as if she has had her eye stomped out, likeGloucester in Lear. Possibly, she has been blinded by looking too long on theevil sun of life’s mysteries. “I cannot live with You” has a witty variation ofthe trope: “Nor could I rise with You / Because Your Face / Would put outJesus’” (640). Profane conquers sacred love, annulling hope of resurrection. Thebeloved’s face is a blazing moon eclipsing the sun, putting out the holy eye ofheaven. There is inferred violence in this blotting out of one face by another.We practically hear the concussion of a rubber stamp marked VOID! That God’sface is in permanent eclipse for Dickinson is confirmed by her remark about herfamily: “They are religious—except me—and address an Eclipse, every morning—whomthey call their ‘Father.’”4 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note4a]In “Renunciation is a piercing Virtue,” the “putting out of Eyes” again refersto the separation of two people, here by the poet’s choice (745). Renunciationis piercing because it is a self-blinding, like Oedipus with the goldenbrooches. The freedom with which Dickinson waves sharp instruments about theface and body leads to this extraordinary metaphor about a neighbor’s death:“like a Skater’s Brook / The busy eyes congealed” (519). The expiring eyescongeal, like pudding or bacon fat in the frying pan, because they literallyglaze over (cf. “The Eyes glaze once—and that is Death”; “Should the glee glaze/ In Death’s stiff stare”; 241, 338). The skaters are the movement of life,quickness in the Renaissance sense. They are darting thoughts, slowing andstopping. We feel the poignancy of the poet’s self-created distance andisolation, as in the great “Because I could not stop for Death,” where thespeaker sees children playing in a schoolyard (712). The point of view istelescopic: a boisterous scene is elegiacally washed in sepia. Whatever thehigher levels of the brook metaphor, we must notice how Dickinson boldlyjuxtaposes eyes and skates. Flashing blades zip over the cornea, scoring it witharabesques.A poem describes death as “when the Film had stitched your eyes” (414). HereDickinson inflicts injury on lids rather than eyes. The lids are sewn together,basted like a hem. The “film” comes from a sinister Mr. Sandman, who gluessleepers’ lashes together. Death, says Dickinson elsewhere, “only nails theeyes” (561). The lids are tacked like a carpet or nailed like a shutter orcoffin lid, surely nicking the eyes in the process. Another alarming example:“I’ve seen a Dying Eye / Run round and round a Room … And then obscure with Fog/ And then be soldered down” (547). Like the detachable brain, the eye takes offon its own, charging around the room like a caged animal. It is captured andsecured by being soldered down, like a loose cannon. Dickinson means dead eyeswill never open again, but the metaphor makes us see a soldering iron applied toan eye, something like Odysseus blinding Cyclops with a red-hot stake. The dyingeye may be desperately searching for God in the room. Ironically, therefore,compassionate Jesus appears with a soldering iron in his hand, since it iseither he or death acting for him who executes this brutal operation (cf. 1123).Soldering appears in another corpse poem: “How many times these low feetstaggered / Only the soldered mouth can tell— / Try—can you stir the awfulrivet— / Try—can you lift the hasps of steel!” (187). Here it is lips meldedtogether, as dreadful a vision for a poet as Christabel’s muteness. Dickinson’sdeath has gotten carried away with enthusiasm and added on lock after lock, likea stage magician or bank manager sealing the vault. After soldering, he drives arivet through the lips and lays on steel hasps like a gag. Mordantly, Dickinsonurges the reader to test these fetters, and one imagines oneself trying to pryopen the corpse’s mouth like a hungry diner struggling with a tin can. As withthe lidded head, the skull is a manufactured object, a constructivist sculptureof metal and nails, like Frankenstein’s monster.Dickinson relishes blood and is lavish with her red palette. “Sang from theHeart, Sire, / Dipped my Beak in it, / If the Tune drip too much / Have a tinttoo Red / Pardon the Cochineal— / Suffer the Vermilion—” (1059). The poet is aself-maiming pelican, tearing clots of flesh from her breast to feed her song,whose notes and bars float through the air in a red trail, a bloody skywriting.Elsewhere she taps the heart again, like a cask of burgundy: “The Mind lives onthe Heart / Like any Parasite— / If that is full of Meat / The Mind is fat”(1355). The mind suckling on the nutlike heart is a barnacle or verminous borer,like canine heartworm. The hungry mind becomes Donne’s bedroom flea, withDickinson taking the parts of both male and female.Dickinson’s world is crowded with deaths, which she collects for her poeticarchives. There are accidents and suicides: “[He] Caressed a Trigger absently /And wandered out of Life” (1062). There are executions of invented characters:“Grief is Tongueless—before He’ll tell— / Burn Him in the Public Square” (793).There is even an elegy for rodents caught in traps: “A Rat surrendered here / Abrief career of Cheer / And Fraud and Fear” (1340). But Dickinson gets her bestblack comedy from the graveyard: “No Passenger was known to flee / That lodged anight in memory— / That wily subterranean Inn / Contrives that none go outagain” (1406). This is like the commercial for Black Flag Roach Motel, a littlebox tiled with insecticide glue: “Bugs check in, but they don’t check out!” TheProcrustean host of the subterranean inn is probably a Christ of mixed motives,avenging the No Vacancy of his infancy by keeping a perpetual open house withone-way doors.Much of Dickinson’s sadism comes from her sardonic speech, a rustic bluntnessabout birth and death. Victorian euphemism was a bourgeois phenomenon, andDickinson as much as Baudelaire is anti-bourgeois. Here is a complete poem:A face devoid of love or grace,A hateful, hard, successful face,A face with which a stoneWould feel as thoroughly at easeAs were they old acquaintances—First time together thrown.  [1711]No charity here. Face and stone are “thrown” or brought together by feloniousassault. The successful potentate is a social Goliath struck in the brow by ourobscure David, a persona Dickinson assumes elsewhere (540). Note the satiricsurrealism: the flinty face is also thrown, sailing off to collide with thestone, as in a lawn game of bowls. Dickinson shares many images and moods withLewis Carroll, another celibate fantasist whose principal creative years, the1860s, were the same. This poem is like Carroll’s croquet match, with the ballwhomped by the head of a human flamingo.Dickinson is a pioneer among women writers in renouncing genteel good manners.She cultivates knavish insolence. The dying once went to “God’s Right Hand”:“That Hand is amputated now / And God cannot be found” (1551). Off with Hishand, commands Amherst’s Queen of Hearts. The shocking amputation of God’s handsymbolizes the suddenness of the modern crisis of faith. God has vanished andleft his severed hand behind, like Constantine’s colossal fragment in theCapitoline courtyard, a favorite theme of eighteenth-century prints. All thatremains of God is the dead hand of the law, devoid of moral substance. His handappears elsewhere: “Of Heaven above the firmest proof / We fundamental know /Except for its marauding Hand / It had been Heaven below” (1205).Death-decreeing God is like Scylla on her cliff, snatching victims from below.He is a bandit or pillager, a Scourge of Men. By Decadent partition, the“marauding Hand” is another free agent, a spidery beast with five fingers.Doctor Dickinson may have to amputate because of gangrene: God suffers fromrotting obsolescence. But more likely she is judge and he is thief. She callshim a “Burglar” or “Mighty Merchant” and accuses him of fraud: “‘HeavenlyFather’ … / We apologize to thee / For thine own Duplicity” (49, 621, 1461).Thus Emily Dickinson, with her love of gore, drags God to the chopping block,hacking off his hand in one of the most daringly dissonant images innineteenth-century poetry.Dickinson’s humor is jarringly curt. A poem begins: “Split the Lark—and You’llfind the Music” (861). This means, take an ax to a songbird! She splits the larklike a log or peach. It is the goose who laid the golden egg carved for a Sadeanbanquet. She archly denies her vocation: “Nor would I be a Poet. … What wouldthe Dower be, / Had I the Art to stun myself / With Bolts of Melody!” (505). Onemust laugh. Like Ben Franklin flying his kite in a thunderstorm, there’s EmilyDickinson sitting in the yard, hitting herself in the head with lightning bolts.Zeus needs Hephaestus’ hammerblow to give birth to Athena, but Dickinson needsno one. “Dower” suggests, as R. P. Blackmur observes, that the poet “marriesherself.”5 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note5a] Therefore these flashes of lightning arethe autoerotic strokes of her conjugal duty. Her creative ecstasy is notafflatus but anvil chorus. If the Muses were to give this poet a heraldic crest,it would be an arm and hammer, as on a box of baking soda. Violence is her lovesong and lullaby.Dickinson’s rough speech can be impenetrable. She says of wintry thoughts, “Gomanacle your icicle / Against your Tropic Bride” (1756). Heidi Jon Schmidt toldme this sounds like a street insult, like “Up your nose with a rubber hose!”Approaching pornographic invective, it is an anti-Keatsian seasonal ode: winterembraces summer, hoary Hades capturing Persephone. The manacle (Blake’s word)recalls Hephaestus’ chain net, thrown over adulterous Ares and Aphrodite, but ithas a dark Gothic ring. The icicle, probably the reader’s body, resembles thecold phantom penis of witch-cult. I wonder if, in its unwieldy grossness, it wasinspired by those dangerous two-story icicles that dangled from rural roofs inpre-insulation days. Dickinson’s perverse metaphor has multiple suggestions oflust, force, bondage, and impotence. The icicle could be a phallic swordstrapped to and Amazonizing the tropic bride. Either it gives her frostbite, orshe melts it. The metaphor ends in a release of tension, a urinary letting go, asudden warm drenching.Dickinson has a zeal for indelicacy. She creates primitivistic pictorialeffects, as in this description of a sunset: “Whole Gulfs of Red, and Fleets ofRed / And Crews of solid Blood” (658). It is unusual, to say the least, to makethe western sky a sea of coagulated blood. Dickinson’s Late Romantic sunset is aTurner repainted by Delacroix. Here is her pleasant paean to a fall day:The name—of it—is “Autumn”—The hue—of it—is Blood—An Artery—upon the Hill—A Vein—along the Road—Great Globules—in the Alleys—And Oh, the Shower of Stain—When Winds—upset the Basin—And spill the Scarlet Rain—It sprinkles Bonnets—far below—It gathers ruddy Pools—Then—eddies like a Rose—away—Upon Vermilion Wheels—  [656]A mass murder seems to have been committed in Amherst. The red streams and poolsrecall the curse upon Pharaoh, when the waters turned to blood. Dickinson may beshowing Jehovah’s rape-murder of pagan mother nature. Sadean reality triumphsover Wordsworth’s illusions. The artery and vein decking this grisly bespatteredlandscape belong to Blake’s Cosmic Man, dismembered in an orgy of sparagmos.Tasty morsels. Who else but Dickinson could think of autumn leaves as bloodclots, “Great Globules in the Alleys”? I would reject a menstrual reading ofthese images. We’re dealing with a woman who spent a lot of time with the helpin the kitchen, so if any personal experience backs this poem, it’s probably thedecapitation and evisceration of chickens!Her letters too display Dickinson’s witty flouting of decorum. She writes hercousins, “No one has called so far, but one old lady to look at a house. Idirected her to the cemetery to spare expense of moving.” The tone is pureVincent Price, a self-satirizing ghoulishness. It comes early to Dickinson, forshe is barely fifteen when she remarks in a letter, “I have just seen a funeralprocession go by of a negro baby, so if my ideas are rather dark you need notmarvel.” To another friend, a newspaper editor, she says: “Who writes thosefunny accidents, where railroads meet each other unexpectedly, and gentlemen infactories get their heads cut off quite informally? The author, too, relatesthem in such a sprightly way, that they are quite attractive. Vinnie wasdisappointed tonight, that there were not more accidents—I read the news aloud,while Vinnie was sewing.”6 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note6a] The two sisters areFates chuckling over earthly fatalities. Vinnie is like Madame Defarge knittingat the guillotine.Dickinson’s sense of vocation is full of the harrowing and cataclysmic. Shetells her mentor, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, “I had no Monarch in my life, andcannot rule myself, and when I try to organize—my little Force explodes—andleaves me bare and charred.” Anarchy, revolution, powder magazines blownsky-high. Dickinson is at war with her own metric. “Bare and charred,” she islike a stand of Wordsworthian trees hit by Sadean forest fire. At his firstvisit, she told Higginson: “If I read a book [and] it makes my whole body socold no fire ever can warm me I know that is poetry. If I feel physically as ifthe top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry. These are the only wayI know it. Is there any other way.”7 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note7a] Poetry isassault and battery on the body. Shamanistic vision demands physical trauma. Hertopless head is like an exploding boiler or a bottle of fermenting cider blowingits cap. Poetry is a kind of scalping, the pastime of ignoble savages (cf. 315).In the Arctic tropics of art, the poet’s head is a coconut clipped by a machete.Another vivid portrait of the artist occurs in Dickinson’s letter to hercousins: “I noticed that Robert Browning had made another poem, and wasastonished—till I remembered that I, myself, in my smaller way, sang off charnelsteps.” Elizabeth Barrett Browning had died three years earlier. Claimingsurprise at Browning’s resumption of his work, Dickinson says she too writes inthe face of constant grief and loss. But notice how she depicts herself in agarish tableau of late-Renaissance theatricality, like a Bernini papal tomb: wesee her standing and singing on the steps of a charnel house, a depository ofcorpses. This is a version of whistling past a graveyard (she told Higginson, “Ising, as the Boy does by the Burying Ground—because I am afraid”).8[ch25_notes.html#ch24note8a] But she is posing on the steps like a Dickens waifholding out her tin cup. Behind the metaphor may be Hamlefs singing gravediggeror, I suspect, George Herbert’s charming “Church-monuments,” where the poetsends his body to school in a chapel of dusty tombs. Thus we should seeDickinson as a tiny scholar emerging from her ghastly lessons and bursting intosong! It’s like a New Yorker cartoon, a portly man with a newspaper turning awayfrom the window to inform his wife, “Oh, it’s just Emily Dickinson singing onthe steps of her charnel house.”Dickinson’s metaphors, based on the Metaphysical conceit, resemble James’s intheir Decadent overliteralization. But his metaphors are sporadic and delusive,while hers are on the epic scale and mean business. I said Swinburne’salliterations and incantatory rhythms are primitivizing devices, returningpoetry to its origins in religious ritual. In Dickinson, it is not rhythm butimage that is regressive. She uses metaphors more literally than anyone else inmajor literature. Her lurid concretization is her mode of Late Romanticmateriality, that contraction from idea to thing we have followed through Frenchand English Decadence. In her poetry, things become persons and persons things,and all press physically on each other in nature’s brutal absolutism.Thus far we have established Dickinson’s unrecognized appetite for murder andmayhem, her sweet tooth for sadomasochistic horror. Her first posthumousreputation was based on her Wordsworthian roulades, her flights of fancyinvolving birds, butterflies, and beggar lads. Richard Chase declares, “No greatpoet has written so much bad verse as Emily Dickinson.” He blames “the Victoriancult of ‘little women’” for the fact that “two thirds of her work” is seriouslyflawed: “Her coy and oddly childish poems of nature and female friendship areproducts of a time when one of the careers open to women was perpetualchildhood.”9 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note9a] Dickinson’s sentimental feminine poemsremain neglected by embarrassed scholars. I would maintain, however, that herpoetry is a closed system of sexual reference and that the mawkish poems aredesigned to dovetail with those of violence and suffering.It is easy to misread the many lyrics affecting complacent Christian faith.Singsong rhythms and neat rhymes are always spurious in Dickinson, the firstmodernist master of syncopation and atonality. Metric regularity means naivecredulity in the speaker (cf. 193). The mood may be cheerful and upbeat, as in“Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord, / Then, I am ready to go!” (279). But thebride happily surrendering herself to celestial marriage is usually in for anunpleasant surprise. Death, not a Redeemer, waits at the top of the stairway toheaven. Dickinson is obsessed with termination, her Decadent variation onChristian apocalypse. In “Our journey had advanced,” a rare instance of thefemale mind turned toward cosmology, the speaker gazing at New Jerusalem sees“God—at every Gate.” Ominously proliferating like Hindu avatars, God is notwelcoming humanity but blocking the way to eternal life (615). This isallegorical repletion, the filling up of fictive space with a single identity indifferent forms, a technique I found in Leonardo, Rossetti, and Emily Brontë.Dickinson’s chirpy newlyweds exit from their poems under suspiciouscircumstances: “I’m ‘Wife’! Stop there!” (199). To keep abreast of Dickinson,like Alice running with the Red Queen, the reader must know where the bodies areburied. The speaker is under arrest; heaven is stasis, a permafrost of nonbeing.The bride poems are clever hoaxes that turn princesses into pumpkins, merechunks of debris. Corpses drop into the grave with a thud. A frequent finale isa slow fade, the voice fumbling for words, as consciousness gutters out.These poems require patient detective work, for they are intricate withsophisticated puns. Dickinson was a devoted student of her Webster’s dictionary.Her wordplay is Alexandrian bookwork, Decadent erudition. But not all hersentimental poems contain hidden ironies. The ones I am most concerned with arejust what they seem to be—pert, peppy trifles. What meaning did such poems haveto so great and commanding a poet? She told Higginson, “When I state myself, asthe Representative of the Verse—it does not mean—me—but a supposed person.”10[ch25_notes.html#ch24note10a] Dickinson’s many voices are sexual personae. Theyfall into her two major modes, the Sadean and Wordsworthian. The sentimentalpoems are feminine personae, representing a primary response to nature, glad andtrusting.Dickinson’s nature has two faces, savage and serene. Lightning sears saplings;volcanos eat villages for breakfast (314, 175). Nature’s lips are “hissingCorals” that open and shut, as “Cities ooze away” (601). The volcano steams withthe sultry sibilants of Milton’s hell. Civilization liquefies at nature’s touch.Erupting Etna “shows her Garnet Tooth”: pirate nature, red-fanged, has asinister crooked smile (1146). Sadean nature suffuses Dickinson’s poetry in theviolent metaphors. Her sentimental and sadistic personae constitute a seasonalallegory. The feminine voices are the vernal phase: they are the pretty, ameadow of flora and fauna, sunny and placid. The sadomasochistic poems are thetectonic, the slow brute contortions of the frigid mineral world. It is botanyversus geology, spring destroyed by winter.The sentimental poems continue a theme we saw in Spenser and Blake: femininityas pockets of undefended consciousness in nature. These are Dickinson’s versionsof Blake’s chimney-sweep poems, where the poet incarnates himself without satirein a simpler consciousness. As in Spenser, femininity brings its opposite intoexistence, in a rush of voracity. Dickinson’s brides are always rape victims,duped by the trickster lover, death. Early in this book, I traced the ancientevolution from femaleness to femininity, which I defended as an artifice of highculture. Dickinson performs a stunning operation on these terms. She acceptsfemininity but denies femaleness, sweeping it out of her cosmos. Her floweringworld is without fructification, Keatsian pregnancies. In the 1,775 survivingpoems, I find only one lush Keatsian moment, in “It will be Summer—eventually”:“The Lilacs—bending many a year— / Will sway with purple load” (342). There areno other swelling images of sensual female weight and mass. Even this one is afuture projection, not a present reality. The poet has “an Acorn’s Breast”—hardand nubby (296). Nature’s processes are erotic but not fertile. Stunting andmutilation are the rule.We saw that because there was no American nature-mother, Romantic writers had toinvent her. When dealing with a major woman artist, we must reverse our terms.One reason Dickinson so surpasses Elizabeth Barrett Browning, whom she admired,is her disturbance of sexual identification. She remarked to Higginson, whileher mother was still alive: “I never had a mother. I suppose a mother is one towhom you hurry when you are troubled.”11 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note11a] MaleRomantic genius crosses the line of gender to create, but his opposite, alreadyfemale, must divide mind from body to embrace the Muse. Dickinson, followingBlake, says to her mother, “Woman, what have I to do with thee?”Chase sees a “rococo style” in Dickinson.12 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note12a] Rococoperfectly describes her feminine personae of Wordsworthian or Emersoniancredulity toward nature. I find a second representational style, used in hersadistic poems of freezing, fracture, and storm and in her great vaultingvisions of mountains, planets, and stars: monumentality.“Ah, Teneriffe!” shehails a volcanic peak, “Clad in your Mail of ices— / Thigh of Granite—and thewof Steel” (666). I argued that monumentality, as in Egyptian and Assyrian art,is masculinizing and that gigantism in a female artist, as in Emily Brontë’sHeathcliff and Rosa Bonheur’s Horse Fair, is a technique of self-desexing. Thetitanic Dickinson is a disciple of Blake, the disciple of Michelangelo, who thusindirectly transmits his style from the late Italian Renaissance to late PuritanAmerica. Feminine Dickinson follows Blake’s Songs of Innocence; masculineDickinson follows Blake’s “The Tyger” and the clashing long poems. Her poems ofcolossal monumentality are the theater of her Brontëan swerve from gender, heralienation from the female body.Dickinson’s sadomasochistic metaphors are a technique of self-hermaphrodization,for as externalizations of internal events, they are an emptying out of femaleinternality. Sexual ambiguities abound in her poetry and letters. She callsherself boy, man, bachelor, brother, uncle. “When I was a Boy,” she likes tosay.13 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note13a] She may be imitating Shakespeare’stransvestite comedies: boyhood would correspond to Rosalind’s androgynousadolescence. Dickinson’s quirky boy-self signifies an early freedom fromsocialization, which she is able to evade as an adult only by lock-up in herhouse and room. “When I was a Boy” could also mean “before I married my Muse.”She signs six letters to Higginson with the proud manly “Dickinson,” breaking alingering gender convention. Until twenty years ago, it was still ungallant torefer to a woman writer simply by her last name.If “boy” is the past, Dickinson’s other transsexual titles are the future. Herreligious poems use a bizarre terminology of royal promotion: “I’m Czar—I’m‘Woman’ now” (199). For Christ’s bride, death is spiritual menarche; but speechfalters, thought is sluggish, and heaven is a blur. The male honorific signifiesthe absolute power of immortality. Czar (derived from Caesar) applies only tomales. Therefore to be czar and woman simultaneously is a chimera of gender. Thesource might be Shakespearean: the speaker is Caesar and Cleopatra. Or Byronic:Sardanapalus is the “she-king” and Semiramis the “man-queen.”Dickinson’s male ranks include prince, duke, and emperor.14[ch25_notes.html#ch24note14a] She applies her favorite title, earl, to God ordeath (ironically interchangeable). For example, a formally dressed corpse is“Riding to meet the Earl” (665). Her Webster’s says, “Earl is now a mere title,unconnected with territorial jurisdiction.”15 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note15a] Sothis is one of the poet’s jokes at the expense of a diminished God. Sometimesshe awards earldom to herself: “When I’m Earl / Won’t you wish you’d spoken / Tothat dull Girl?” She will wear an ermine gown, with imperial eagles on her beltand buckles (704, 452). She progresses from girl to earl like Alice from pawn toqueen. Her projected sex change is like a fancy French royal portrait. Thisflirtatious and swashbuckling poem is addressed to a “Sweet” who just might beanother woman, which would explain the satisfactions of future maleness.Dickinson says of a flower: “I had rather wear her grace / Than an Earl’sdistinguished face— / I had rather dwell like her / Than be ‘Duke of Exeter’”(138). Choosing nature over society, earth over heaven, she expresses theseoppositions in sexual polarities. She could “wear” an earl’s face but choosesnot to. The rejected face is like an ancestor’s mask hung on a hat rack by thedoor. She elsewhere uses the place name Exeter for heaven or the murky afterlife(373). Hence the Duke of Exeter is probably God—that is, the Exiter, draggingmen off the world stage with his shepherd’s crook. One of her letters, echoingAchilles in Hades, again projects the option of a future sex change: “I hadrather be loved than to be called a king in earth, or a lord in Heaven.”16[ch25_notes.html#ch24note16a]The poet dons her earl’s face in a bridal poem opening with a boudoir flurry:she wears trinkets, cashmere, “Raiment of Pompadour”; servants’ fingers dressher hair “as Feudal Ladies wore.” She has “Skill—to hold my Brow like an Earl”(473). The earl’s brow is the coldness of her new corpselike state. We are leftwith the peculiar picture of a male face peering out from a bridal veil—afeature, we saw, of ancient fertility rites. This heroine is another divinebride left at the altar. The road to the church in Amherst is full of potholes.“I’m saying every day / ‘If I should be a Queen, tomorrow’. … If it be, I wake aBourbon” (373). Ominous intimations of immortality: to wake a Bourbon means, inDickinson lingo, to ascend the guillotine.Dickinson’s royal titles are honorary degrees of extremity, marking advance intothe afterlife. They are hermaphroditic because transcendental. Death makes womanan earl in the same way impersonality makes her an androgyne, by masculinizingher into abstraction. In her transsexual leaps into eternity, Dickinson is likeSwinburne’s Sappho, who turns male at death by sloughing off her passive femalebody. In some poems, the sex scheme of spiritual evolution is boy/woman/man,conforming to Blake’s traditional pattern innocence/experience/redeemedinnocence. Woman is merely the social mask of adult life.Dickinson’s stark juxtapositions of personae—czar/woman, earl/girl—are a kind ofsexual collage. She enjoys disconcerting the reader with freakish conjunctions.In a poem about neglecting her garden, she says, “My Cactus—splits her Beard /To show her throat” (339). Why her? Why not its or his? She provocativelysexualizes the cactus to make it a bearded lady, a circus hermaphrodite. Sheautomatically uses language of gender to suggest the visual and tactile contrastbetween cactus spines and fleshy core, exposed by the cracked stalk. Dickinson’sfemale cactus is grossly sensual, a vulval arroyo, a swatch of sleekness in atrough of nettles. It pleases the poet, luxuriating in solitude, to conjure upandrogynes unknown to man. Note again the epiphanic style: the cactus partingher beard to show her throat is like Jesus or Mary pointing to their burning,pierced hearts or like St. Francis displaying his stigmata. This eroticizedreligious exhibitionism belongs to the Italian and Spanish Baroque, not toAmerican Protestantism.Dickinson can sexualize any situation, even the picking of a flower:So bashful when I spied her!So pretty—so ashamed!So hidden in her leafletsLest anybody find—So breathless till I passed her—So helpless when I turnedAnd bore her struggling, blushing,Her simple haunts beyond!  [91]The poem, apparently light and frothy, is perverse psychodrama. Dickinsonassumes the persona of male raptor, Hades bearing down on Persephone in themeadow. She is a giant among pygmies. As in her poem about the dying balloon, adelectable eroticism is produced by feminine flutterings of vulnerability andresistance—“bashful,” “ashamed,” “hidden,” “breathless,” “helpless,”“struggling,” “blushing.” Even Dickinson’s most innocuous poems stir with darkundercurrents.The most blatant of Dickinson’s masculine self-portraits is “My Life had stood aLoaded Gun,” where she is a totem of phallic force (754). The “Owner” or“Master” is only he, a pronoun. She is the real power, without which he cannotact. Her consciousness engulfs his, for he sleeps while she watches—asvoyeuristic as Whitman in The Sleepers. I find multiple sources for the poem.The woman-as-gun is like Aaron’s rod turned serpent: Aaron similarly acts forMoses and at his bidding. Second, she is a modern Excalibur, the magic swordgiven Arthur by the Lady of the Lake. Third, she is Spenser’s Talus, Artegall’srobot squire, “the iron man” (F.Q. V.vi.16). Fourth, as her master’s “Eye” and“Thumb,” that is, his sight and hands, she reenacts the sadomasochistic romanceof Charlotte Brontë, one of Dickinson’s favorite writers: the woman-as-gun isspunky Jane Eyre finally ruling Rochester, blinded and maimed, at novel’s end.The executioner-gun is the inanimate point of contact between man and nature.Owner and Amazonian gun pursue a doe, Belphoebe’s prey in The Faerie Queene.When the gun speaks, the mountains “reply”: she is nature’s Sadean voice. Wehave seen the “smile” of her “Vesuvian face” before, in Etna’s evil garnettooth. Woman-as-gun is predatory and annihilating: “None stir the second time /On whom I lay a Yellow Eye / Or an emphatic Thumb.” To see is to slay. She hasPetrarchan looks that kill. The yellow eye is the gun’s smoky flame, a savagetiger’s eye. Laying an eye on is a familiar locution (for example, “I’ve neverlaid eyes on him”); here it projects a target circle onto the victim, pierced bythe gun’s bullet-eye. The emphatic thumb is the master’s trigger fingermetamorphosed into sound. It is also her thumb, a crushing hammer. The metaphorreminds me of my Vermont landlord, a carpenter, nonchalantly grinding out livewasps on a windowpane with his thumb. Hence I wonder whether the eye and thumbcome from Dickinson’s actual observation of artisans at work, especially masons.The emphatic thumb is, finally, the thumbs down in life’s bloody arena.This poem is one of Romanticism’s great transsexual self-transformations.Dickinson’s self-projection into the gun is exactly like Coleridge’s intoravished Christabel: the poet is reaching for the remotest extreme of sexexperience. The vampire who violates Christabel symbolizes anti-Wordsworthiandaemonic nature. “My Life had stood a Loaded Gun” is another Romantic vampirepoem. The gun with “the power to kill, / Without the power to die” is thevampire who paralyzes by eye-contact. She is mechanical, a bride of metal whoenters but cannot be entered. Unlike Jane Eyre, she does not share her master’spillow, because she is barren. The loaded gun is Dickinson as denatured vampire,a masculine maker of sadistic poetic speech. She is another androgyne asnineteenth-century manufactured object.I view as a companion piece to this a fantastic poem where Dickinson switchessexual point of view: “In Winter in my Room/I came upon a Worm / Pink, lank andwarm.” She ties the worm with a string but returns to find it grown into ahissing snake: “He fathomed me— / Then to a Rhythm Slim I Secreted in his Form /As Patterns swim / Projected him.” She flees to a distant town to write, “Thiswas a dream” (1670). Eden’s serpent as con man and shaker of faith? I see onlysexual theater. Any eely creature that manages to blow itself up from “Pink,lank and warm” to a long wiener doing the hula tends to seize the attention ofus moderns. After Freud, this poem would be unwritable, except by a child orpsychotic. Its unself-conscious clarity is astounding.The gun and worm poems are reverse images of each other. Aaron’s serpent nowrefuses to resume its original shape. The menacing worm is the gun as not-self.In the first poem, the poet fuses with her masculine half; in the second, she isalienated from it. Here she is in her feminine persona, which perceives onlyWordsworthian nature. The snake is unbearable because it is chthonian nature’sabrogation of beauty, dignity, and hope. It is a symbol of the Sadean natureforce that the poet herself spewed out upon the doe in the gun poem. The wormpoem takes place in winter because nature is devastated. Remember the autumnpoem drenched in crimson gore: autumn marks the year’s massacre of creatures,Dickinson’s “Green People” (314).Other poems show the snake’s meaning as a nature symbol for Dickinson. The wilysnake lives in “the swamp” (1740). “A narrow Fellow in the Grass,” he likes “aBoggy Acre, / A Floor too cool for Corn.” The poet never meets him “Without atighter breathing / And Zero at the Bone” (986). Swamp and bog are the chthonianswamp that antedates agriculture. The popular myth that snakes are slimy, whenthey are smooth and dry, contains an imaginative truth. The snake bears theinvisible slime of the swamp of human origins. Speaking of the widespread“horror of reptiles,” G. Wilson Knight claims we would prefer death by tiger todeath by boa constrictor or octopus: “From such cold life we have risen, and theevolutionary thrust has a corresponding backward disgust. … And since we do notknow what to make of tentacles mindlessly groping and distrust the clammysea-moistures of the body, we fear especially our sex-organs with multiforminhibitions, seeing in them shameful serpentine and salty relations. And yetthis fear is one with a sort of fascination.”17 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note17a]Dickinson’s snake poems are ritual encounters with the primitive and uncanny.She feels zero at the bone—a phallically penetrating cold—because the archaicsnake nullifies evolution. Sadean nature’s brute cycle swallows up individualbeings and smashes the things made by man’s mind and hand.How did the worm poem, with its nervy performance of erection and ejaculation,come to a poet whom Higginson described as “that virgin recluse?”18[ch25_notes.html#ch24note18a] Dickinson had an older brother, Austin, whoseadultery has recently come to light. I suspect, however, that the penile model,common in rural Amherst, may have been a stallion. The string with which thepoet binds the worm (like tying a string round one’s finger) is a Wordsworthianleash or halter, unequal to the task, for the chthonian can burst any humanchain.In a poem with the same sexual pattern, “I started Early—Took my Dog,” asociable shoreline scene turns into a rape, as the sea assaults the incautioustourist. He rises up her apron and bodice and threatens to eat her. She flees;he follows: “I felt His Silver Heel / Upon my Ankle—Then my Shoes / Wouldoverflow with Pearl” (520). The glutted vaginal shoe is a conceptual receptacle,moral and literary. It is first an inherited, internalized sexual restraint (cf.340). The shoe is a male gift, not a prince’s glass slipper but a paternaltyrant’s iron boot. The image recurs in Sylvia Plath’s “Daddy,” where the Nazifather is a “black shoe” jailing the slug-white adult daughter. Second, the seaoverflows Dickinson’s “simple Shoe” because the revelation of nature’s coarsereality is always a rape of sentimental illusions. In the worm and sea poems,the speaker flees to a town for safety. An ironic refutation of Wordsworth:civilization, into which the poet normally did not venture, is our only defenseagainst nature.Snakes have suppleness, a quality Dickinson mistrusts. She says, for example,“Death is the supple Suitor / That wins at last” (1445). Her males or malesurrogates have a facility of movement or unctuous self-assurance, correspondingto men’s complacent ease in their bodies in Woolf novels. In mythology, men areparalyzed by Medusan females, symbols of nature. In Dickinson, women areparalyzed by male hierarchs of heaven and earth. The worm epiphany is shockingbecause it is an invasion of the room of one’s own, for Dickinson as for Woolf asacred ideal, a temenos of the inner self. I would reject a reading of the wormpoem that reduced it to a New England spinster’s fear of sex. The error would bein dissociating the poet from the snake, when in fact it is her self-severedmember. She has dropped it by autotomy, like the tail or claw of a fleeinglizard, lobster, or starfish. I see the scene as a surrealist film, like UnChien andalou. The poet is like a man who drops his umbrella and suddenly findshimself in female clothes. He turns around to discover the umbrella changed intoa condor, staring at him malevolently. In other words, the poet in the privacyof her room momentarily lays aside her loaded gun, her male persona. But whenshe returns, it is puffed and distended like Lucille Ball’s bread doughballooning out of the kitchen.The snake is a fantasy of power escaping Dickinson’s control. It is the poet’sswelling ambition, which menaces the feminine persona by which she passes unseenthrough society. Why does it take reptilian form? Everyone thinks of the serpentof Genesis. But a snake in a poet’s chamber could be Delphi’s resident python, asymbol of prophecy. The serpent’s schooling has been somewhat spotty, so whenour sibylline poet is in her feminine phase, an oracle reigning on a trivetrather than a tripod, discipline is difficult. Second, woman and snake in asecond-story chamber recall Shakespeare’s Cleopatra and her phallic asps—withone asp driving the queen out of her monument into the streets of Alexandria.Third is the snake coiled round the dove’s body in Christabel, a sleeping poet’svision of the maiden ensnared in her bedchamber by the vampire. In the gun poem,Dickinson is the vampire hunting female prey. In the worm poem, she switchesroles and is the feminine dove resisting the vampire-serpent’s advances. Shesaves herself only by dashing out of the house and skipping town. Fourth is themysterious meeting in the tower of Byron’s Manfred with his sister or femaledouble. This is an incandescent moment in Romanticism, one of whose farflunginfluences, we saw, is Dorian Gray’s fatal encounter with his double in thelocked room at the top of the stairs.Dickinson’s worm poem is a Romantic confrontation of doubles. The snake is amaterialization of her own phallic potency, her Jungian animus or repressedmasculine half. Jung says, “Psychologically, demons are interferences from theunconscious.”19 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note19a] Dickinson’s snake is both demonicand daemonic. Incest in Byron, I said, may reflect a desire to copulate with theself in sexually transmuted form. In her Byronic tower, Dickinson asWordsworthian naif refuses sexual relations with her chthonian double. But inthis meeting of moral and sexual antitheses, the sadistic principal triumphs,driving its opponent from the field. The snake has intelligence (“He fathomedme,” mentally and sexually) and the power of poetry (“Rhythm,” “Form,”“Patterns”). He is both a Sadean speaker and the idea of a Sadean poem. Thesnake is what Dickinson is and what she has made. But he is out of control, forWordsworth can never put down a Coleridgean sedition. The snake is an archaicapparition disestablishing its mistress’ social persona and filling thebourgeois home with its Delphic fumes.The first poem has a further sexual ambiguity. The gun has “stood in Corners,”dormant, until put to use by her master. Her masculine power is greater thanhis, but for it to take effect, he must drag her about and aim her. The gun ispotent yet dependent. Aquinas says, “A body is composed of potentiality and act;and therefore it is both active and passive.”20 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note20a]The loaded-gun metaphor is hermaphroditic because of its sexual metathesis (thepoet’s phallic self-transformation) and because of its synthesis of action andreaction.Dickinson likes this binary trope. “He found my Being—set it up— / Adjusted itto place— / Then carved his name—upon it / And bade it to the East / Befaithful—in his absence” (603). The psychodrama is like that of the gun poem,except that limited travel has become immobility. The poet sees herself as atoppled gravestone or cromlech, claimed by a vagabond male (probably thebridegroom Jesus). That he “carves” his name into her, like a cattlebrand, isanother of Dickinson’s sadomasochistic adornments. She is like a tree initialedby a romantic swain. She is a marred block, a pillar turned toward the light,like Lot’s incinerated wife.Dickinson as scarred tombstone is a passive phallic monument, both masculine andfeminine. Her “Columnar Self” stands on a “Granitic Base” (789). She is thinkingof obelisks in the town cemetery: “And the livid Surprise / Cool us to Shafts ofGranite— / With just an Age—and Name / And perhaps a phrase in Egyptian” (531).The variant for the latter is “latin inscription.” Such metaphors illustrateDickinson’s monumentality, which I interpret as a self-masculinizing style. Herstone towers are sexual monoliths, slabs of aggressive assertion caught betweenpotency and paralysis. Signed and sealed by the divine lover who will neverreturn, she portrays herself architecturally as a fallen caryatid or armlessVenus. Dickinson’s experiments with active and passive echo those of Sade, whoinvents exotic conjunctions where an individual both penetrates and ispenetrated. However, like Baudelaire’s vampires, she seals up female innerspace, compressing herself into impermeable blocks. The granite shafts aretombstones but also the corpses themselves, labeled like mummies in a museum.Dickinson thinks of death as enforced passivity, agonizing impediment ofmovement. She dwells on the moment a person becomes a thing, as in “The lastNight that She lived,” where the pronoun disappears in the last stanza: “AndWe—We placed the Hair— / And drew the Head erect” (1100). A human has passedinto the object-world. Some death poems use no personal pronoun at all: “‘Twaswarm—at first—like Us.” It, it, it, she says of the dying one (519). Mind, body,and gender have gelatinized. Dickinson’s death is a great neuter state. A deadfemale is a frozen phallic shaft; a dead male is a felled tree of humiliatinginertness. Death is a maker of sterile androgynes. A corpse is soldered withrivets because it is a manufactured object, an android. Dickinson’s notoriouspreoccupation with death is thus a hermaphrodizing obsession, a Romantic motifin its Decadent late phase.Both men and women are passive toward death, God’s vizier. This intensifies thesexuality of “Because I could not stop for Death,” a parodic “Swing Low, SweetChariot.” The lady kidnapped by her gentleman caller feels a chill, “For onlyGossamer, my Gown— / My Tippet only Tulle” (712). Gulled into the grave, thespeaker finds herself ill-dressed. Her garments of fairy-tale delicacy areChristian illusions about resurrection. This feminine persona is universal,symbolizing all mankind. That is, humanity is feminine in relation to death,fate, God. Men too wear the flimsy gown of false hope, transvestized by theirown credulity. Men too are raped by the trickster lover, God/death. Thisillustrates the richness with which Dickinson invests femininity. As in Sade andSwinburne, God condemns man to fascist oppression and sexual subordination.Unable to advance or retreat, the dead rest in an infinity of checkmate (615).Dickinson declares, “I saw no Way—The Heavens were stitched.” There is noentrance to the tent of the inhospitable Bedouin god (378, 243). Death’svictims, like serfs fallen into peat bogs, are sod androgynes, gelded orvirilized into monuments of God and nature’s indifference.Dickinson’s poetry, as an art of sexual personae, comes from Elizabethan andJacobean drama. She thinks in theatrical or masquelike terms. She writes capsulescreenplays of agony and ecstasy where someone is tortured, dying, transfigured.The poems are sexual scripts, like Sade’s. Dickinson turns Wordsworth’s natureinto an inferno, ring upon ring of pain. As in Spenser and Blake, personae standfor spiritual states.The masculine personae of savage nature have several tones. One is that ofroutine, as when a jaunty bird strolls down the walk, bites a worm in half, andeats “the fellow, raw” (328). Frost acts with the same matter-of-factpitilessness: “the blonde Assassin” beheads a flower at play (1624). The frailvictim represents human and vegetable nature, conquered by the cold abstractionsof natural and divine law. Sometimes a cat is the assassin, teasing a mouse,then mashing it to death (762). Or the sea pursues seductively, before drowningits human guest: “‘My pantry has a fish / For every palate in the Year,’— / Tothis revolting bliss / The object floating at his side / Made no distinct reply”(1749). Dickinson unreels her own cinéma vérité, anticipating the day whenAmericans would be regaled at suppertime by newsfilms of corpses being draggedfrom harbors. Nature can kill by patient ambush: “How the Waters closed aboveHim / We shall never know. … Spreads the Pond Her Base of Lilies / Bold abovethe Boy / Whose unclaimed Hat and Jacket / Sum the History” (923). Glug, glug.The assassin is a dark sump, personified in the French Decadent manner as ahaughty, handsome archetypal female, her “pancake” train the base of a leafyTiffany lamp.Dickinson’s weather reports seem written by Sade: the wind is “like hungrydogs”; “yellow lightning” shines through fissures in “Volcanic cloud”; the treeshold up “Their mangled limbs / Like animals in pain” (1694). Nature is an ashywar zone of greed and suffering. Dickinson’s usual style is gruesome Sadeancomedy: “the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies,” as if it were a giant kittenplaying with boats in its milk dish. The tiger “fasts Scarlet / Till he meet aMan / Dainty adorned with Veins and Tissues / And partakes”: a Spenserian momentof exquisite gore (872). Snack time rocks around the clock in Sadean nature.Drowsy Keatsian satiety is impossible in Dickinson. She condemns her creaturesto wakefulness and deprivation.Humanity’s Wordsworthian illusions about nature are always being sabotaged.Dickinson asks why birds on a summer morn “Should stab my ravished spirit / WithDirks of Melody” (1420). The poet is being raped and assaulted by a flock ofwarblers. She means nature’s beauty is cruel because transient. But her stageset is a Wordsworthian landscape filled with Baudelaire’s drill-beaked birds.Their chirps are a shower of knives falling on passersby (cf. “The AwfulCutlery”—forked lightning—dropped from “Tables in the sky”; 1173). Dickinsoncomposes a clashing Sadean music, a Decadent cruel beauty. Another poem has asimilar soundtrack: “The Man to die tomorrow / Harks for the Meadow Bird /Because its Music stirs the Axe / That clamors for his head” (294). Nature is inleague with social forces of extermination. Its pretty sounds incite the ax toblood-lust. Dawn wakes the executioner, of course, and not the ax. But inDickinson’s dark vision, the nonhuman world telegraphs its Sadean signals fromhill to hill. The ax rises up and avidly rings, just as the scaffold “neighs” inanother poem, an eager whinny fusing by dream-logic the horse-drawn tumbril tothe naying or negation of execution on the creaking platform (708).In “I dreaded that first Robin, so,” a Wordsworthian bird again agitates thepoet with its thoughtless felicities: “I thought if I could only live / Tillthat first Shout got by— / Not all Pianos in the Woods / Had power to mangle me”(348). The pianos are trees sighing in the wind. Their branches against the sky,black keys on white, are played like an Aeolian lyre. Baudelaire too hears vocaltrees, “living pillars” speaking “confused words” (“Correspondences”). Dickinsonthinks of pianos, just as she thinks of an oppressive cathedral organ in“There’s a certain Slant of light” (258). The word “mangle” is attractive to herfor the number and devastation of its implied wounds. But what are manglingpianos?—certainly louder than duelling banjos. One imagines a victim tangled upin piano wires and lashed by felt hammers, like a farmhand caught in a thresher.That she sees many pianos is highly surreal, like a Busby Berkeley film. Thepoet is merely listening to the wind from her house or garden. But in hermetaphor, she is in the woods running the gauntlet past rows of voraciouspianos, their lids open like maws. Horror show again: Dickinson’s nature is anunnerving spectacle of madly playing pianos escaped from human control. Evensmall things can mangle: she says of a spiritual problem, “This is the Gnat thatmangles men” (1331). Making a Carrollian leap from midge to behemoth, aman-mangling gnat is what viciously waits amid Wordsworth’s daffodils.Like Swinburne in Anactoria, Dickinson shows sadomasochism suffusing the world:“The Sun took down his Yellow Whip / And drove the Fog away” (1190). Snow andwind are “Brooms of Steel,” iron flails of the sky-god (1252). The moon is “likea Head a Guillotine / Slid carelessly away”—a constellation of decapitation(629). “The Black Berry wears a Thorn in his side”: a wound for him or us? (554)The sea is “An Everywhere of Silver / With Ropes of Sand” (884). Dickinson’sglobal equilibrium is harsher than Spenser’s: the beaches are shackles, and hersea lies in bondage. A favorite word is “iodine,” which she uses to describesunset light in sky or water, as in “the Iodine upon the Cataract” (853, 673,710). She is punning on its Greek root: iodes means “violet.” Butcharacteristically, she makes sky and stream running wounds daubed with carmineantiseptic. This resembles those two poems in which the fall landscape andwestern sky are great blood puddings—the universe as abattoir. She sees sunsetas conflagration: “The largest Fire ever known / Occurs each Afternoon.” Itconsumes “An Occidental Town, / Rebuilt another morning / To be burned downagain” (1114). Disaster is nature’s norm. The scarlet western hills and cloudsare cities rising and falling, like ancient cities. The poet is Nero singingwhile Amherst burns.Like Swinburne’s Sappho, Dickinson thinks God jealous and vindictive, anattitude she got from Blake. God lures mankind into the grave with promises of afair future, only to default on his contract. His credit history is a spree ofembezzlements. He condemns man to death and loss: “Earth is short / And Anguishabsolute” (301). Pleasure and pain are yoked: we pay for every ecstasy withanguish, “In keen and quivering ratio” (125). The rose’s attar is “the gift ofScrews” (675). Life is governed by sadomasochistic extremes: “A Wounded Deerleaps highest”; the “Smitten Rock” gushes; the “trampled Steel” springs (165).Nature’s dynamism is an excruciating seesaw. God’s sadism determines the poet’sown. Her brutal metaphors record her search for a rhetoric equal to what God haswrought. A sadist woman speaker, one of the west’s unique sexual personae,avenges the feminine passivity into which God thrusts mankind.Dickinson reserves her most contemptuous witticisms for the Son who came tojustify the ways of God to men. Unlike her precursors, she refuses to glamourizethe primary Romantic persona of the martyred male heroine. “The Auctioneer ofParting / His ‘Going, going, gone’ / Shouts even from the Crucifix / And bringshis Hammer down” (1612). Christ turned moneychanger is conducting a slaveauction from the cross. He is selling souls to the highest bidder, the shadowyGod who is death. “Ineffable Avarice of Jesus,” murmurs Dickinson in a letter.21[ch25_notes.html#ch24note21a] Christ’s hammer is the gavel of the Last Judgment,already striking men with daily blows. Here the holy carpenter’s nail wounds aremasochistically self-inflicted. Keats says of himself, “Imaginary grievances …nail a man down for a sufferer, as on a cross.”22 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note22a]“Going, going, gone”: life’s funeral train chugs into motion to Christ’s ominous“All aboard” (cf. the puns on crucifix boards). His “It is finished” becomes aparodic diminuendo, fading echoes of à Dieu.Dickinson’s cynical surrealism is unparalleled among great women writers. For ananalogy to the auctioneer poem we would have to turn to Bob Dylan’s “All Alongthe Watchtower” (1968), the Golgothan dream-vision of a Jewish satirist whotreats Christ much more sympathetically. Dickinson says, “God was penurious withme, which makes me shrewd with Him.”23 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note23a] More of hersharp irreverence: “In passing Calvary,” she likes “To note the fashions—of theCross— / And how they’re mostly worn— / Still fascinated to presume / ThatSome—are like My Own” (561). The faithful speak of death or sorrow as a cross tobe borne. Dickinson compares her crosses with others’, noting their shape,weight, and number. How are they “worn”? Does the condemned staggering upCalvary carry the cross on his left or right shoulder? What “fashions” does hemodel on the cross—a tunic? a loincloth? The poet is a bystander at an Easterparade or a pedestrian pausing before a shop window, planning a future purchase.Perhaps her unorthodox train of thought was begun by the episode of Veronica’sveil, for at that moment, Christ was adorned with a woman’s chador. Dickinson’scampy mix of religion and couture is like Baudelaire’s and Wilde’s.Christ is in Dickinson’s line of fire because his testament misrepresents hisgodfather’s business. The poet is Little Red Ridinghood discovering a wolfishdivine face hidden within the flowery fringes of Wordsworthian nature. Christ’sincarnation had a bloody climax, reached by a road paved with good intentions.One of Dickinson’s most brilliant metaphors: “Mine—by the Sign in the Scarletprison— / Bars cannot conceal!” (528). The body is Poe’s Red Death and shrinkingtorture cell. The body’s netting of veins and arteries (like a bale of chickenwire) are the bars on door and window. What is “mine” is the certainty ofextinction. The bright sign in the scarlet prison is mortality, which cannot beconcealed by the bars or tribunals of future divine judgment. Dickinson agreesthat life imitates Christ, for our extension in the body lays us on the cross ofBlake’s tree of nature.Consciousness in Dickinson takes the form of a body tormented in every limb. Hersadomasochistic metaphors are Blake’s Universal Man hammering on himself, likethe auctioneering Jesus. Her suffering personae make up the gorged superself ofRomanticism. I argued that modern sadomasochism is a limitation of the will andthat for a Romantic like the mastectomy-obsessed Kleist it represents areduction of self. A conventional feminist critique of Emily Dickinson’s lifewould see her hemmed in on all sides by respectability and paternalism,impediments to her genius. But a study of Romanticism shows thatpost-Enlightenment poets are struggling with the absence of limits, with thegross inflation of solipsistic imagination. Hence Dickinson’s most uncontrolledencounter is with the serpent of her antisocial self, who breaks out like theAeolian winds let out of their bag.Dickinson does wage guerrilla warfare with society. Her fractures, cripplings,impalements, and amputations are Dionysian disorderings of the stable structuresof the Apollonian lawgivers. God, or the idea of God, is the “One,” without whomthe “Many” of nature fly apart. Hence God’s death condemns the world to Decadentdisintegration. Dickinson’s Late Romantic love of the apocalyptic parallelsDecadent European taste for salon paintings of the fall of Babylon or Rome. HerDionysian cataclysms demolish Victorian proprieties. Like Blake, she couples theminiature and grandiose, great disjunctions of scale whose yawing swings releasetremendous poetic energy.The least palatable principle of the Dionysian, I have stressed, is not sex butviolence, which Rousseau, Wordsworth, and Emerson exclude from their view ofnature. Dickinson, like Sade, draws the reader into ascending degrees ofcomplicity, from eroticism to rape, mutilation, and murder. With Emily Brontë,she uncovers the aggression repressed by humanism. Hence Dickinson is thecreator of Sadean poems but also the creator of sadists, the readers whom shesmears with her lamb’s blood. Like the Passover angel, she stains the lintels ofthe bourgeois home with her bloody vision. “There’s been a Death, in theOpposite House,” she announces with a satisfaction completely overlooked by theWordsworthian reader (389).But merely because poet and modern society are in conflict does not mean artnecessarily gains by “freedom.” It is a sentimental error to think EmilyDickinson the victim of male obstructionism. Without her struggle with God andfather, there would have been no poetry. There are two reasons for this. First,Romanticism’s overexpanded self requires artificial restraints. Dickinson findsthese limitations in sadomasochistic nature and reproduces them in her dualstyle. Without such a discipline, the Romantic poet cannot take a single step,for the sterile vastness of modern freedom is like gravity-free outer space, inwhich one cannot walk or run. Second, women do not rise to supreme achievementunless they are under powerful internal compulsion. Dickinson was a woman ofabnormal will. Her poetry profits from the enormous disparity between that willand the feminine social persona to which she fell heir at birth. But her sadismis not anger, the a posteriori response to social injustice. It is hostility, ana priori Achillean intolerance for the existence of others, the female versionof Romantic solipsism.In the beautiful hypothesis of “Shakespeare’s sister,” Virginia Woolf imagines agirl with her brother’s gifts whom society would have “thwarted and hindered” toinsanity and suicide.24 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note24a] Women have beendiscouraged from genres such as sculpture that require studio training orexpensive materials. But in philosophy, mathematics, and poetry, the onlymaterials are pen and paper. Male conspiracy cannot explain all female failures.I am convinced that, even without restrictions, there still would have been nofemale Pascal, Milton, or Kant. Genius is not checked by social obstacles: itwill overcome. Men’s egotism, so disgusting in the talentless, is the source oftheir greatness as a sex. Women have a more accurate sense of reality; they arephysically and spiritually more complete. Culture, I said, was invented by men,because it is by culture that they make themselves whole. Even now, with allvocations open, I marvel at the rarity of the woman driven by artistic orintellectual obsession, that self-mutilating derangement of social relationshipwhich, in its alternate forms of crime and ideation, is the disgrace and gloryof the human species.Dickinson was one of those who convert every reverse into an impulse to create.Humiliation and disillusion were whisked into abstract structures, posted on themap of the world in her war room, with its game tokens of advance and retreat.Her premiere subject is power, psychological, natural, and divine, to whichwoman has free access only in eras of earth-cult. Hence her fondness for theword “electric.” Her poems are thermal sensors, registering nature’s surges ofanimating energy. But her changes are abrupt and traumatic. “A happy lip breakssudden,” she typically remarks (353). This stiff upper lip belongs to a marblestatue with a hairline fracture. Matter thwarts spirit’s urges. As a scientistof nature, Dickinson is a Decadent catastrophist, predicting transformation byconvulsion.Dickinson’s breakage of objects signifies the collapse of meaning. She importsamputation, her favorite limiting device, from Dionysian nature into society.For example, she says of her mother’s stroke, “Her Hand and Foot left her.” Whena neighbor died, “He had no hands.”25 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note25a] Infirmity isseverance, because Dickinson is a Late Romantic separatist practicing Decadentpartition. Like the brain escaping the lidded skull, Mrs. Dickinson’s hand andfoot march out of the house like servants giving notice. The poet’s amputationsare like Kleist’s mastectomies. Brutal self-reduction is a restocking ofnature’s organ bank.Clinically, hypochondria takes two forms. The less serious is anxiety aboutinternal disease; the more pathological is obsession with loss of limbs. Sincethey have more appendages to lose, men might be expected to suffer from thelatter, but, just from common observation, this does not seem to be so. LaurenceSterne’s Tristram Shandy, which I find utterly unfunny, may be a malehypochondriacal construction, for it is an accident series of disasters to bodyparts—a flattened nose, shattered knee, crushed groin bone, a penis circumcisedby a falling window. Our amputational Dickinson exhibits the graver of thehypochondrias. This may be the castration-anxiety of a hermaphrodite poet. Forwe saw that the moment she detaches herself from her phallic genius loci, thepink worm, trouble begins like a rumble in the boys’ lavatory.Significantly, Dickinson shows little concern with disease. Her sadomasochistichorrors are confined to piercings, slashings, hackings, scorchings, anddislocations. Why? Poe’s Red Death, Baudelaire’s “Voyage to Cythera,” andHuysmans’ flower episode make disease a major Late Romantic metaphor. It is thedepraved touch of female nature. Dickinson’s substitution of accidents fordisease is part of her extraordinary effort to wipe chthonian femaleness out ofnature. Her nature, I said, has two faces: one benevolent, one hostile,turbulent with storm and volcano or dead with stone and ice. I argued thatlapidary Decadent beauty, the bronzed and jewelled surfaces of Baudelaire andMoreau, are a protest against the chthonian. Like Poe, Dickinson is exiled fromEuropean objets d’art. Therefore her ice images, expressing a revulsion fromnature identical to the French Decadents’, are a great leap forward into modernmetaphor.One of Dickinson’s stunning achievements is her prophetic vision ofintergalactic nothingness. A funeral turns into a science-fiction film: “Bootsof Lead” cross her soul, “Then Space began to toll, / As all the Heavens were aBell, / And Being, but an Ear, / And I, and Silence, some strange Race /Wrecked, solitary, here.” She drops “down, and down— / And hit a World, at everyplunge” (280). Dickinson’s glimpses of futuristic desolation, minimal in JulesVerne, precede H. G. Wells’s by thirty years. What of her lead boots? Only we,her true contemporaries, can identify them, for we have seen them walk on themoon. Dickinson’s lonely plunge into Pascal’s abyss is the severest thought, tomy knowledge, of any premodern woman writer. Even despairing Wordsworth giveshimself one withered companion in his stark desert basins.In “Safe in their Alabaster Chambers,” a masterpiece, the “meek” dead wait forresurrection under their “Rafter of Satin, / And Roof of Stone”:Grand go the Years—in the Crescent—above them—Worlds scoop their Arcs—And Firmaments—row—Diadems—drop—and Doges—surrender—Soundless as dots—on a Disc of Snow— [216]The alabaster chamber is the tomb and also the corpse’s marble flesh, a palaceturned prison. The coffin’s satin coverlet is like the gossamer gown of thekidnapped maiden, a hope that will be rent. The stone roof is the sky that willnever open. The meek have inherited the earth. The heavens revolve in greatmathematical arcs; history speeds up, kings’ crowns falling like snowflakes. Thepoem ends with a soft numbing of the tongue, as syllables sputter out intosilence. The poet takes a position of visionary distance from which human lifeseems a speck in the cosmos. Especially brilliant is the muted movement of“Doges” into “Snow,” all the colors of Venice—art, imagination, and worldlyglory—vanishing into eternity.This frigid, godless universe is a major theme of modern literature, as inWallace Stevens’ “The Snow Man” (1923). Dickinson anticipates Kafka in combiningemptiness and absurdity with tyrannical authority. How amazing that this is thework of a solitary, neglected, untravelled woman. How did she make so remarkablean advance on contemporary literature? Dickinson’s modern ice world is thedirect result of her Brontëan swerve from gender, her refusal to acceptfemaleness in herself or nature. Science fiction’s glacial wastes, which she isthe first artist to see, are a landscape from which maternal procreation hasbeen blasted. Her dreams of death by freezing are a poetic anorexia or willedstarvation. There is no disease in her because disease is a female miasma, aninfection. There are no contaminations, only mutilations, because nature is in astate of cold purity, its accidents a Newtonian collision of hard objects. Theblood the poet sheds is lustral, a self-detoxifying bath. There is never anydisgust in her, only horror, for disgust is a male response to female nature,which she has purged out of existence.Dickinson projects chthonian uninteiligibility onto phallic daemons, whom sheflees because they would betray her into fecundity. Her sexual premises alsodetermine her rhetorical forms. Whitman extends himself outward to beimpregnated in huge, sprawling prose-poems. But Dickinson’s small lyrics are asexual closure, the cage of a self-sequestered sibyl. Whitman’s poems aggregatewhile Dickinson’s consolidate ego. She declares, “The Soul selects her ownSociety— / Then shuts the Door.” The soul must “Choose One”—herself—“Then closethe Valves of her attention / Like Stone” (303). The inflexible heart of metalspigots is a tomb-monument of the self.Jane Austen calls her own writing “the little bit (two Inches wide) of Ivory onwhich I work with so fine a Brush,” an allusion to the modest scope ofprovincial life that she took for subject.26 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note26a] Buther ivory is not so small, first because the novel as a genre has social breadthand second because her work revives the English Renaissance ideal of marriage.Dickinson, on the other hand, is a monastic. She chooses one because the selfmust be sealed up and its integrity defended. Her poems are Apollonian cells ofthe principium individuationis. Baudelaire’s poems, I noted, are corruptedentities, projections of a diseased body. Dickinson’s major poems are burstinghermaphrodite lozenges, a small feminine body charged with a mighty masculinemind. The rhetoric itself is powerfully bisexed.Language too is confined. Whitman and Huysmans’ proliferation of vocabulary isthe opposite of Dickinson’s contraction of syntax. Her poems are imploded, theircontours jagged and torn by suction. Poring over her dictionary, she introvertswords, doubling them back in puns on their roots. Her ellipsis produces brokenmetrical accents, a queer lurching rhythm. She cites Higginson’s priorcriticism: “You think my gait ‘spasmodic’”27 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note27a]Dickinson has a halt meter, like a hobbled horse or a Chinese woman who hasbound her own feet. Her harsh pressures on language are another rituallimitation, by which the Romantic self returns to governable dimensions from itsmonstrous immensity.There is inherent irony in the idea of female Romantic genius, which I haveexamined in two cases, Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson. Romanticism is animaginative realignment of western male will toward female powers, which itinternalizes. The reason the work of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and her fellowpoetesses is so weak is that Romanticism is a sex-crossing mode which addsfemaleness to maleness. Femaleness added to femaleness is a Romantic redundancy,to which the Muse will make no visitation. Brontë and Dickinson succeed asRomantics because they are women of masculine will who tend toward sadism.I portrayed the High Romantic poet as a passive sufferer or male heroine.Dickinson unites this inherited persona with its opposite. As a woman Romantic,she must suffer and assert. She is male heroine and sex-defying Romantic hero.Both extremes must be forcefully materialized, which is why her sadisticmetaphors are among the most grisly in major poetry. They are injections ofsynthetic male hormone into a hermaphroditic genre that resists femalepractitioners. I spoke of Wordsworth’s shamanistic sacrifice of virility:Dickinson makes this Romantic surgery literal. Lacerating self-abuse is herritual consecration, by which she makes her vows to art.Dickinson’s sadomasochism is most intense during her most creative decade. Shesays, “I felt a Cleaving in my Mind— / As if my Brain had split” (937). Herpoetry is a war of personae, a clash of opposites; it is sexually, psychically,morally, and aesthetically bivalent. Over eternity, her pastoral Wordsworthianpoems must yield to their daemonic counterparts. Criticism’s error has been toregard the sentimental poems as indistinguishable from period vers de société.But Dickinson’s contemporaries had no secret wells of savagery, no grandphilosophical system. Her sentimental personae do not stand alone. The purestfeminine poems are without internal ironies. They are acted upon by theircontexts. Read any of her bird and butterfly poems while keeping her sadisticlyrics in mind, and you will find them magically transformed, their bordersagitated by malign influences. In her Wordsworthian verses, the poet is a virginodalisque, titillated by the pressure of erotic menace around her.Sentimentality is one of Dickinson’s major techniques. It is her sexual allure,the magnetism drawing her masculine and feminine personae together. She usesfemininity to drive femaleness out of nature. Rejected by many women of ourtime, femininity attracts her as a poetic mask, partly because men too wear thismask in their encounters with God and death. Dickinson endorses femininity’sartificial or rather unnatural character: it is both of and against nature,since spring always loses to frost and decay. Thus she treats femininity assimultaneously spurious and authentic. She exaggerates the social frivolities ofher gender in order to thrust nature’s force into the masculine, bypassingmythology’s chthonian females.The polarized sexual powers of Dickinson’s poetry form a huge circle, anuroboros of pursuit and flight. Masculine devours feminine, as in Spenser. Allpersonae are in motion, turning with the pagan solar year. The poet enters amongher characters, the mark of Romantic as opposed to Renaissance literature. Sheis both Proteus and Florimell, rough rapist and coy maiden. She is like theonanist Genet, of whom Sartre says, “He is the criminal who rapes and the Saintwho lets herself be raped.”28 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note28a] Dickinson works bysexual polyphony. We cannot speak of her individual poems as “good” or “bad” butrather as more or less masculine and feminine.Wordsworth and Rousseau posit hostility between nature and society, which theydefine as respectively female and male. Dickinson unexpectedly unites societywith Wordsworthian nature by linking them both to femininity. Wordsworth’snature is chthonian and deeply female. But it isn’t in Dickinson because she gotWordsworth through Emerson, and Emerson is in American flight from the female.Through her feminine personae, the poet pretends to be what she seems to be tothe social eye. She has gone out the front door of her gender and come in theback. Sentimentality restores her poetic equilibrium. It adds representationalweight to the light end of the sexual seesaw. Her feminine personae are mentalcalisthenics by which she dissuades herself from sadism. Already at a peak ofmasculine tension, she swings them about like Indian clubs or thistledownbarbells, which enable her to maintain her muscle tonelessness in prison.Wordsworth’s poetic gifts come through the opening he makes to the mother.Dickinson’s poetry requires separation from the mother, whom she demotes fromcreative authority. Here again she uses Blake against Wordsworth. Her relationswith her real mother should not be exaggerated, since in Romanticism it isimagination, not fact that is primary. But she told Higginson, “My Mother doesnot care for thought.” She said of her sister Lavinia, while both parents werestill alive, “She has no Father and Mother but me and I have no Parents buther.” This is like Woolf calling herself her sister Vanessa’s “firstborn.”29[ch25_notes.html#ch24note29a] Dickinson and Brontë cultivate the Romanticsister-relation, at its most incestuous a denial of ancestral indebtedness.There are very few mothers in Dickinson’s nature poetry, nearly all qualified bysome irony. “Gentle” mother nature puts her “Golden finger” to her lip, willing“Silence—Everywhere” (790). Gold fingers are sunset rays, signaling sleep forman and beast. But nature’s silence may be golden because it is the mineralcoldness of death. When nature “smiles” at “Her eccentric Family,” we shouldthink of Leonardo, not Raphael (1085). I admire these lines: “In Ovens green ourMother bakes, / By Fires of the Sun” (1143). Believers in the mawkish Dickinson,a Shirley Temple who wakes when the genius nods, will dismiss such things asidle Victoriana: aproned mother nature bustles about, whipping up batches ofcookies. But the kitchen scene has a cruel subplot. Nature is Hansel andGretel’s witch, grilling her children in her German ovens. Here is the sobertruth:But nature is a stranger yet;The ones that cite her mostHave never passed her haunted house,Nor simplified her ghost.To pity those that know her notIs helped by the regretThat those who know her, know her lessThe nearer her they get.  [1400]Nature is no meadow of green promise but a spectral Gothic chamber that will notlet history be born. All knowledge is a return to the past. Dickinson writesHigginson, “Nature is a Haunted House—but Art—a House that tries to behaunted.”30 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note30a] Romantic art is daemonic: it finds thepagan spiritualism in matter.In Dickinson’s year, false spring supplants summer. She rejects fecund ripeningfor herself as well as her metaphors. Habitually dressed in white, she wasalways nun or bride, never mother. Her boy personae are also deflections ofmaturation, an anorexic suppression of sexual shape. Sentimentality inDickinson, as opposed to Wordsworth and Wilde, is a road away from the motherrather than toward her. It is no coincidence that while some major femaleartists have married, very few have borne children. The issue is notconservation of energy but imaginative integrity. Art is its own self-swelling,proof that the mind is greater than the body.In biology, neoteny is the protraction of juvenile traits into adulthood or thepremature development of adult sexual traits in a hostile environment.Dickinson’s feminine personae are neotenic. They are juveniles trying to stopthe aging of the year, a delay that makes winter’s sudden arrival morecatastrophic. Her feminine personae are self-delectating fictions, in which arecluse toys with exhibitionism. There is an erotics of smallness in Dickinsonresembling the seductive preciosity of Blake’s “Infant Joy.” She loves to appearfrail and pitiable—but only to make more delicious her vamping betweenhierarchic levels. There are satiric tableaux of human subordination: “I hopethe Father in the skies / Will lift his little girl— / Oldfashioned—naughty—everything— / Over the stile of ‘Pearl’ “(70). Pearl is herword for the resurrected realm of white frost. She is a naif gamboling in thefeminine glad rags of Christian trust. Here are three hierarchic levels: “Papaabove! / Regard a Mouse / O’erpowered by the Cat!” (61). She sent the poem toher headstrong sister-in-law Susan—the cat in whose jaws the poet pleasurablystruggles. Such superficially simple passages are cascades of hierarchicalforce, tiered fountains splashing with sadomasochistic refreshment.Dickinson calls herself “Sparrow,” “little Girl,” “child.” She refers to “mylittle Gypsy being,” “my little sunburnt bosom.”31 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note31a]The most cunning self-description occurs in a letter to Higginson, who hadrequested a photograph: “Could you believe me—without? I had no portrait, now,but am small, like the Wren, and my Hair is bold, like the Chestnut Bur—and myeyes, like the Sherry in the Glass, that the Guest leaves—Would this do just aswell?”32 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note32a] What a psychodrama! The poet is small,mild, pathetic. Even her eye color is a tincture of abandonment. But she wroteevery word of this in perfect consciousness of her secret greatness and power.She is like Cleopatra breathing, “I am pale, Charmian,” one line beforeclobbering the messenger. The simile of the leftover sherry is a triumph of theJewish-mother type of masochistic, guilt-inducing trope. Dickinson scholars aretone-deaf to this element in her. Italians and Jews tend to be alert toself-dramatizing gambits where force masquerades in personae of infirmity. Forexample, my formidable grandmother would respond to telephone inquiries byclaiming she was “Sola sola com’ un’ aiuch’,” “Alone alone like anowl”—watching, in other words, in dismal solitude.33[ch25_notes.html#ch24note33a] Now this Italian owl is bird of a feather with theAmherst wren and sparrow. A ferocious hierarch is practicing an adroit mime ofmisery.Dickinson’s sherry eyes appear to withdraw and be withdrawn from, when in factthey aggressively advance on the reader. What causes exasperation or panic inthe children of Italian and Jewish matriarchs is being directed toward a genteelstranger with no suspicions of the poet’s profound doubleness. Higginson is afish whom Dickinson lures into reach by appetizing quavers of dependency. In hernext letter, she tells him, “All men say ‘What’ to me, but I thought it afashion.”34 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note34a] She is the beggar girl banned from thecommon table. She is Cassandra, never believed, or Coleridge’s poet isolated inhis holy circle. Her plaintiveness is rich with gloating. It’s clear everyonesaid “What?” to her because, like a guest without small talk, she had a badhabit of sinking dialogue under Delphic meteorites, great thuddingconversation-stoppers. One has known persons who do this, fatiguingly. It is oneof the most aggressive forms of speech, intimidation cloaked as revelation.Dickinson is Salomé dancing into her seven veils.Many critics remark on the irony of Dickinson’s veneration of Higginson, a manwell-known in his day but now just a footnote in literary history. She calledhim “Preceptor” and signed herself “Your Scholar.” He was the ambassador of thegreat world to the sequestered poet, who joked about her own nonentity: “I’mNobody! Who are you?” (288). Her relation to him was like Shelley’s to MaryGodwin or Mill’s to Harriet Taylor, a symbolic deference where a strongerintelligence bows to a lesser. Dickinson’s ritual self-abasements are nearlySwinburnian. A poem begins: “I was the slightest in the House—/I took thesmallest Room” (486). She likes lowness for its tingling sensations ofhierarchic distance. She stretches and squeezes the artificial gap betweensuperior and inferior, as if working an accordion or chest-expander,exhilarating herself with inhalations of subordination.A diminutive friend of mine, a native Bostonian and paragon of archaic WASPdecorum, has a psychodramatic stratagem under stress that never ceases to amazeme: she appears smaller. This conchlike spiral of spiritual and physicalretraction is not in the Mediterranean arsenal. Quite the contrary, the besetsoutherner follows the animal principle of raised hackles, an emphaticenlargement of personality: one leaps to one’s feet, waves the arms, raises thevoice. Dickinson’s most cherished maneuver is to appear smaller, a camouflage insociety. This compression of persona is a hallucination projected upon theunwary by a gamesman of tough will. The poet has duped and beguiled notHigginson alone but generations of her readers and critics.Higginson recorded his first meeting with Dickinson in a long letter to hiswife. We see the poet’s calculated presentation of self with wonderful clarity:A step like a pattering child’s in entry & in glided a little plain woman withtwo smooth bands of reddish hair & a face a little like Belle Dove’s; notplainer—with no good feature—in a very plain & exquisitely clean white pique & ablue net worsted shawl. She came to me with two day lilies which she put in asort of childlike way into my hand & said “These are my introduction” in a softfrightened breathless childlike voice—& added under her breath Forgive me if Iam frightened; I never see strangers & hardly know what I say—but she talkedsoon & thenceforward continuously—& deferentially—sometimes stopping to ask meto talk instead of her—but readily recommencing.Dickinson plays the child entering her own kingdom of heaven. Supposedly notknowing what to say, she manages to talk nonstop. Higginson is under attack bythe Delphic priestess. The inner reality of their encounter is registered in hisextraordinary closing words: “I never was with any one who drained my nervepower so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to livenear her.”35 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note35a] Higginson felt a strange spiritualoppression in her presence. Even without this lucky corroboration by an urbanewitness, I contend we are able to tell from the poetry alone, with itssadomasochistic duality, that Emily Dickinson is one of the great examples ofthe vampirism of the artist. In a survey of vampire legends, Montague Summersspeaks of the “spiritual vampire” or “psychic sponge” who has the ability to“re-energize” him or herself “by drawing upon the vitality of others”: “Suchtypes are by no means uncommon. Sensitive people will often complain ofweariness and loss of spirits when they have been for long in the company ofcertain others.”36 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note36a] Pressing the beam of her mentaleye on Higginson, the poet extorts his vitality from him, in shamanistictransfusions of soul-plasm.The vampire as artless child: as with Brontë’s ghostly waif at the window orColeridge’s fainting Geraldine in her white robe, Dickinson’s approach tovisitor and reader alike is a cinematic mirage, a silvery vapor of entrancement.Of the century’s major American writers, Dickinson is the most Decadent inreligious and sexual psychology. Her fondness for corpses far exceeds theVictorian cult of bereavement. She is closest here not to Sir Thomas Browne andthe Metaphysicals but to the Hamlet who casually says of dead Polonius, “I’lllug the guts into the neighbor room” (III.iv.213).A typical Dickinson love poem begins, “If I may have it, when it’s dead.” Toheck with warm flesh; she’ll take the corpse. “Forgive me, if to stroke thyfrost / Outvisions Paradise!” (577). The male is “it” because death neutralizesgender. He is sexually and emotionally tolerable only after he has beenprocessed into passivity, patted and kneaded like a pie crust. Keats’s Isabellawaters her lover’s severed head with her tears. But Dickinson sheds no tears. Asshe fondles the corpse, she flashes a dazzling smile.Stroking corpses of both sexes is Dickinson’s literary hobby (187). People usedto die at home, and their bodies were laid out in the parlor. The quick tripfrom hospital to funeral home—curious term—was not yet invented. Suppression ofthe mechanics of death is a recent bourgeois phenomenon; at Italian funerals,for example, friends and relatives file past the open casket on the morning ofburial and kiss the corpse’s forehead. Nevertheless, Dickinson’s corpsefantasies are beyond the norm. They are perverse because her intimacy requiresinertness. Her consciousness exults in the unconsciousness of its objects. Twinto Whitman of The Sleepers, she is a phantom lover in the world of the dead. Shevalues corpses as artifacts: personality has passed from Dionysian mutabilityinto Apollonian perfection. But her language is always amorous: “By the dead welove to sit, / Become so wondrous dear” (88). She focuses on the deathwatch,prior to the shift of states: “Promise This—When You be Dying— / Some shallsummon Me.” To her belongs the last sigh and the right to “Belt” the dead eyeswith her lips (648). Dickinson’s erotic claim, like insurance compensation afteran accident, is activated only by suffering and death. Her passionate kisses arefor faces that can make no return. She is a priestess of the Mysteries,materializing just in time for the last rites.Death, as a collision between time and eternity, has a transfiguring glamour:“To know just how He suffered—would be dear” (622). Soul and body in agony leavetheir psychic imprint, which the poet as sleuth ruthlessly ferrets out. Shenever bothered to conceal her ravenous curiosity. She is just twenty-three whenshe writes a complete stranger, Edward Everett Hale, to dig up data on the lasthours of a childhood friend. Had she a current address, she says, she would bepumping the wife of the deceased instead.37 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note37a] Hereye longs to penetrate the inmost sanctuary, medical and marital. She dreams ofexposing herself to death’s radiation and joining the victim in the blaze ofmortal fission.Dickinson is a Decadent voyeur, and her corpse poems are specimens of sexualobjectification, the primary principle of Decadent eroticism. She turns men intocorpses, just as Poe turns Berenice into a box of teeth. The corpse poemsformalize that eye-object relation which oppresses Romantic poets in theirstultifying freedom. Seeing across space and time, Dickinson ritually fixes thedistance between self and world, freezing it with her Medusan eye. She is thatrarity, a female necrophiliac and sexual fetishist. Necrophilia was devised bythe modern psyche to control and place sex after its sudden detachment fromhierarchical systems. Like hysteria, necrophilia has gone out of fashion. Peopleno longer paralyze their arms, like Breuer’s Anna O., or root about incemeteries, plucking up corpses to violate or snack on.38[ch25_notes.html#ch24note38a] Dickinson hastens her lovers toward death to draftthem into her poetry. She binds them with immobility, like turkeys dressed forthe oven, to ready them for her post-mortem embraces. She is a connoisseur ofdeath, a Decadent collector. Like the maiden of Blake’s “Crystal Cabinet,” shetraps her lovers in dark bowers to which, she boasts, she owns the key (577).Each corpse poem is a glass coffin with the withered beloved on display. Theseare the trophies of the belle of Amherst, a Circe who shrinks men with a tap ofher wand.Like Rachilde’s Raoule de Vénérande, Dickinson makes a mausoleum out of abedchamber. Her men are living dolls, like Raoule’s wax gigolo. They aremanufactured objects, a romance of prosthetics. Death is the black paint inwhich the poet dips her brush, because the objet d’art lacks prestige innineteenth-century American culture. Even wellborn James must go to Europe toprocure his golden bowl, and significantly, it is ritually broken within itsnovel. Decadent Dickinson makes objets d’art of her loved ones, but for lack ofartistic models, she turns them into ice sculptures, corpi delicti of God’scrimes.The lingering Puritan taboo on visual gratification, I noted, inflamed the eyein American Romanticism. Poe, Hawthorne, Emerson, Whitman, and Dickinson sufferfluctuations between voyeurism and paranoia. Dickinson flattens her chosen onesby her ocular force. She drops on them like a hawk, her eye sadisticallyglittering. Her Decadent voyeurism is abundantly clear in her letters, whichincreasingly become a chain of condolences. Death and calamity are the onlysubjects on which the poet speaks. Life is a string of black pearls.The letters can be in questionable taste. Dickinson writes to a woman whosecousin drowned in, of all places, Walden Pond:Dear friend,What a reception for you! Did she wait for your approbation?Her deferring to die until you came seemed to me so confiding—as if nothingshould be presumed. It can probably never be real to you.The poet, with her avid eye, rapturously theatricalizes the death so as tosharpen grief rather than relieve it. Victim and rescuer seem actors rehearsinga play. The lingering pondside death is critiqued as if it were a summer charadein a gazebo. Here is a letter to a woman whose house caught fire:Dear friend,I congratulate you.Disaster endears beyond Fortune—  E. DickinsonThomas H. Johnson, Dickinson’s Harvard editor, comments, “The letter does notsound as though the damage had been serious.”39 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note39a]Poor trusting man. The fire was obviously a catastrophe! Dickinson sends acongratulations card because victimization means canonization in her Sadeancosmos. There is maniacal glee in her sepulchral letters. She makes strange hardjests at tender moments. To a friend whose infant son had an operation for acongenital foot problem: “How is your little Byron? Hope he gains his footwithout losing his genius.”40 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note40a] Flattery andtartness queasily mingle. The letter raises the fleeting possibilities that theboy will be either a brilliant clubfoot or an agile dolt. Our poet’s honeyedwords have a secret sting.Letter after letter memorializes the deaths of friends or relatives of theaddressees, on whom are heaped strained, hieratic epigrams and paradoxes. Thereis not a grain of Christian compassion in these letters. They are a LateRomantic prose-poem, a stunning chronicle of necrophilia and voyeurism. Therecluse chooses the moments to show herself to the multitude. Bereavement is heropportunity: daily life stops, and people are paralyzed. Dickinson as oracle andritual mourner injects herself into their suffering. The letters of condolenceare deathday rather than birthday gifts, handcrafted by the poet in her secretforge.Dickinson tells Higginson: “A Letter always feels to me like immortality becauseit is the mind alone without corporeal friend…. There seems a spectral power inthought that walks alone.”41 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note41a] This stalking spectreis the vampire-poet scanning the world for disasters. She imagines the mournersreceiving her letters. She is there, by telekinesis, suddenly appearing likePoe’s raven on Pallas’ head, ready with words of wisdom. The mourners’ socialmasks are off. They are naked and at their most passive. This is when the poetmakes contact. She unites with them as they confront elemental realities. Shesenses death’s primitivistic energy, which excites her. She is a shark lured byspilled blood, a rustic hog snuffling out black truffles of woe. All ofDickinson’s letters are archly seductive, but the letters of condolence are asadomasochistic congress. She is like Blake’s God creating Adam, smothering thebereaved while they are prostrated.The letters of condolence are erotic, self-conscious, ritualized, and thereforeDecadent. Like the governess of Turn of the Screw, Dickinson is a Romanticterrorist, presiding over eruptions of horror. Like the governess, sheconstructs a Decadent world of voyeuristic sightlines. Her eroticized lust tosee all is combined with intense fear of the visual. Like Gautier’s QueenNyssia, Dickinson feels contaminated by others’ eyes. She defends her perceptualpurity by walling herself up in her Danae’s tower or snowbound “Pearl Jail.”42[ch25_notes.html#ch24note42a] She dreads being seen precisely because her eye isso powerful and intrusive. Letters and poems allow her to be heard at a distancewhile remaining invisible, as if on a public-address system. Nothing is moreterrible in her poetry than when her barriers are breached and the visual poursin on her uncontrollably: “Creation seemed a mighty Crack / To make me visible”;“Space stares all around” (891, 510).These mirrorlike returns upon her of her own ocular aggression explain many ofDickinson’s eccentricities. She refused to be photographed or to receive mostcallers; she would not address letters in her own hand, and she carried onconversations with visitors from behind a screen or from the next room. This ispartly a rejection of stable social identity, the poet of many personae refusingto commit herself to one. But her ostentatious withdrawals are tactical. Shedrives up her market value by spiritual hoarding and taxes her friends bywithholding herself. Her tarrying in the wings is frictional. Her appearancesare delayed ejaculations, meant to bring her audience to a peak of frenzy. Heraggravating affectations, which would now be called passive-aggressive, evoked amemorable response from Samuel Bowles, who shouted up the stairs: “Emily, youwretch! No more of this nonsense! I’ve traveled all the way from Springfield tosee you. Come down at once.”43 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note43a] Her bluff called,the poet calmly descended.Dickinson’s manipulative letters are masterful in their subtle calibrations ofconditional visibility. Here is her account, in a letter to her Norcrosscousins, of a great fire that destroyed downtown Amherst. Fire bells awoke herin the middle of the night:I sprang to the window, and each side of the curtain saw that awful sun. Themoon was shining high at the time, and the birds singing like trumpets.Vinnie came soft as a moccasin, “Don’t be afraid, Emily, it is only the fourthof July.”I did not tell that I saw it, for I thought if she felt it best to deceive, itmust be that it was.She took hold of my hand and led me into mother’s room.44[ch25_notes.html#ch24note44a]Sensitive, childlike Emily—then forty-eight years old! The perversity is not somuch in Dickinson’s docile consent to her sister’s deception as in the eeriereproduction of the scene for the Norcrosses, drawing them in as anotheraudience and so tripling the poet’s impersonations. Is Vinnie, “soft as amoccasin,” Indian or snake, consoler or seducer? This is another scene ofSpenserian ambiguities. Donning her mask of Wordsworthian femininity to turnfrom a Sadean spectacle, Dickinson is the soft focus of row after row ofobserving eyes, beginning with her own. She invites the gaze of the Norcrossesso that she can watch them watching her—like Wilde’s Gwendolen. It is atheatrical triangulation of sadomasochistic perception, part coercion, partself-immolation. A similar complex moment occurs in Puccini’s Madame Butterfly(1904), when Sharpless asks the geisha’s half-American child his name. Butterflyherself responds, rhetorically addressing her son and putting words of rebuke inhis mouth, her voice rising to an ecstatic climax: “Answer: today my name isTrouble. But tell my father when you write to him that on the day he returnsJoy, Joy will be my name.” Affect snakes through person after displaced person,with Madame Butterfly cleverly gathering all the ricocheting sightlines of pityback toward herself—the only person she does not mention. The analogues toDickinson’s sexual personae are usually Italian. Her antecedents are not inPuritan probity but in Baroque sensationalism.The mild personae and endearments of Dickinson’s letters are an artifice ofcourtship, Sunday dress. Her real attitude toward her correspondents is deeplyambivalent: “Are Friends Delight or Pain?” (1199). Everything in her world isgoverned by a sadomasochistic dialectic. She experiences oscillations ofattraction and repulsion, toward and away from people. Like Baudelaire andSwinburne, she thinks love an affliction. Emotion enervates, a waste of psychicenergy for unworthy or indifferent objects. She bitterly complains of others’inability to sustain her level of intensity: “Bind me … Banish … Slay” (1005).She would agree with Wilde, who speaks of pain as “a mode of self-realization”:“Pleasure for the beautiful body, but Pain for the beautiful Soul.”45[ch25_notes.html#ch24note45a] Pain for her is mentalized sex, a Decadentspecialty.Dickinson turns Metaphysical paradox into Sadean combat, pull and counterpull.Divine love “invites—appalls” (673). Or “Hawthorne appalls, entices.”Relationships are wrestling matches of domination and submission: “He was weak,and I was strong—then— / So He let me lead him in— / I was weak, and He wasstrong then— / So I let him lead me—Home” (190). These symmetrical reversals arelike Kleist’s sexual scheme in Penthesilea, where hero and Amazon repeatedly winand lose. A poem begins, “I rose—because He sank” (616). Dickinson sends aone-line note to her sister-in-law: “I can defeat the rest, but you defeat me,Susan.” She has a pagan view of love as a hazardous sphere of primitive power.She applies antagonistic formulas to everything: “I saw two Bushes fight justnow—The wind was to blame—but to see them differ was pretty as a Lawsuit.”46[ch25_notes.html#ch24note46a] Dickinson lived off her father and brother’s lawpractice, but that lawsuits are “pretty” is something else. She applies aWordsworthian word to Sade’s wrangling nature. Like Wilde, Dickinson makeshierarchical placements, but only as a prelude to sudden inversion: “Cakes reignbut a Day” (1578). Even cakes are victim to elevation and overthrow! Gwendolen,we saw, also makes cake a caste symbol. The snobbish Wildean analogy is clear inlines like, “The parasol is the umbrella’s daughter / And associates with a fan”(1747). Dickinson sexualizes common objects and classifies them by gender andrank.Because her eroticism is visual rather than sensual, Dickinson’s love affairstake the form of adoration and apotheosis. Another one-line note to hersister-in-law: “Susan’s Idolator keeps a Shrine for Susan.” An early letter toher brother speaks of herself and Susan’s sister: “Martha and I are very muchtogether—we fill each niche of time with statues of you and Sue and in returnfor this, they smile beautiful smiles down from their dwelling places.” Theseshrines and statues, along with her references to nuns and Madonnas, belong toDickinson’s heretical Catholicism. Here she is like Hawthorne, introducingMadonna and child into the Puritan Scarlet Letter. Her editor says of a poemcomposed on the fourth anniversary of Charlotte Brontë’s death, “Throughout herlife ED was especially sensitive to such occasions.”47[ch25_notes.html#ch24note47a] In other words, the poet had her own Calendar ofSaints, holy days consecrated to deceased friends and great ones. Like theFrench and English Decadents, she is attracted to Catholicism for its ritualism,not its morality. She zeroes right in on Roman Catholicism’s pagan heart.Dickinson is a fan, a hero-worshipper, a creator of hierarchic preeminence evenwhen, as with Higginson, there is none. Like Shelley in Epipsychidion, she fallsin love with charismatic personality. Like Swinburne in Dolores and Faustine,she is a sexual cultist, electing gods and saints to whom she lights votivecandles. Affect is dependent on hierarchic distance, so married intimacy witheither sex is impossible. The letters sternly enforce a sense of estrangementeven toward her principal favorites. A note to Susan, apparently after thelatter returned from a trip: “I must wait a few Days before seeing you—You aretoo momentous. But remember it is idolatry, not indifference.”48[ch25_notes.html#ch24note48a] Elaborate ceremonial restrictions anddemarcations. Susan and Austin lived next door: good fences make good neighbors.Dickinson hopes, in a poem to Catherine Scott Anthon, whom she may have turnedaway at the door, that someday her loved ones will understand “For what Ishunned them so”: “We shun because we prize her Face / Lest sight’s ineffabledisgrace / Our Adoration stain” (1410). For the Romantic, reality is alwaysvulgar. The idea of the beloved is superior to actual fact. Dickinson has acuratorial relation to her gods: for them to retain their glamour, she mustrefuse to see them. She perpetuates the divinity of her chosen ones byimprisoning them in the cell of her mental eye, from which they cannot breakfree into concrete presence. Seclusion is her perceptual weapon againstdisillusion.Until the publication of her complete works in 1955, Emily Dickinson was theheroine of an American romance. Disappointed in love, she languished alone,striking off poems on the birds and bees and lowering gingerbread to urchinsfrom the window. Candidates were nominated for the mysterious heartbreaker—aminister, a married man, an invalid. To their credit, Dickinson scholars quicklydiscerned this as reductive. Her poetry shows that men in general did not pressdeeply on her imaginative life. We saw how the most vivid poems show the loverdead or in extremis. One heterosexual fantasy takes three stanzas to describethe bad weather before getting to the cozy domestic scene: “How pleasanter—saidshe / Unto the Sofa opposite— / The Sleet—than May, no Thee” (589). Enter andexit the master as a stuffed divan. The sofa is simply the usual corpse plantedin the parlor like Psycho’s rocking-chair mummy. Man, always temporarilyindisposed in Dickinson, is strapped into place like a convict in the electricchair. Quadriplegia and rigor mortis are her way of dealing with malesuppleness.Dickinson’s contemporaries noticed her equivocations about marriage. She oftenaddressed letters only to the wife and used showy euphemisms for the word“husband.” The writer Helen Hunt Jackson says to her, “‘The man I live with’ (Isuppose you recollect designating my husband by that curiously direct phrase) isin New York.” This quirk is like Lewis Carroll’s pointed exclusion of husbandsand brothers from dinner invitations. Dickinson aggressively elides husband intowife. One victim is Higginson, who writes his wife, “E.D. dreamed all night ofyou (not me) & next day got my letter proposing to come here!! She only knew ofyou through a mention in my notice of Charlotte Hawes.”49[ch25_notes.html#ch24note49a] The poet has evidently reconstituted her mentor,like frozen orange juice, in sexually more palatable form.While they have discarded the popular image of the lovelorn Dickinson, manycommentators still entertain the improbable idea that in her late forties sheseriously considered marriage to Judge Otis P. Lord, a close friend of her latefather. I cannot reproduce the name “Judge Lord” without smiling. The mererecitation of so imposing a conflation of hierarchisms must have provided thepoet with exquisite shivers of Sadean subordination. I suspect Dickinsonexploited Lord for a cinematic rematerialization of her father’s forbiddingpresence. Her father (whom Higginson described as “thin dry & speechless”) washer symbolic agent of limitation, by which she curbed and disciplined heroverexpanded Romantic imagination. That she could or would have tolerated asingle day of abridgment of her monastic autonomy is preposterous. Her lettersto Lord are contrived and artificial. The voice belongs to her twitteringfeminine personae, whom she tucks in becoming postures of devotion. The Lordletters are completely blotted out in emotional intensity by those to the oneperson with whom she was passionately involved: her sister-in-law Susan. Byevery standard except the genital, the stormy thirty-five-year relationshipbetween the two women must be called a love affair.Susan Gilbert was Dickinson’s best friend before marrying her brother Austin.Therefore the poet’s claim upon Susan was the primary one. Austin’s adultery mayhave been a side effect of the erotic intensities between his sister and wife.Dickinson’s allusions to Susan begin in chatty, girlish Wordsworthianism and endin dark, charged ambivalence. In other words, their relationship recapitulatesthe movement from High Romanticism to Decadence. The young poet recalls kissesand confesses heartthrobs and fever: “I want to think of you each hour in theday. What you are saying—doing—I want to walk with you, as seeing yet unseen.”As the years pass, tension grows. “Egypt—thou knew’st,” writes Dickinson,playing humiliated Antony to Susan’s Cleopatra. Four years before her death:“With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than anyone living—To say that sincerely is strange praise.”50[ch25_notes.html#ch24note50a] So Susan is also lago to her Othello. Susan hasprovided her with the full range of emotional experience, from love to hate.The most disturbing of the surviving messages to Susan: “For the Woman whom Iprefer, Here is Festival—Where my Hands are cut, Her fingers will be foundinside.”51 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note51a] Flesh of my flesh: the women areRomantic twins, mentally and physically one. But Susan has aggressively invadedand occupied the poet, like the vampire penetrating Christabel. She is like acommensal crab taking up residence in a live oyster or mussel. Here aselsewhere, Dickinson adapts the story of doubting Thomas, who thrusts hisfingers into Christ’s wounds. The self-divinizing poet advertises her love byexhibiting her cut hands, like the statue of a Catholic martyr. Surreally, it isSusan who cuts her and Susan who painfully probes the wounds she has made. Andone cannot avoid the hallucinatory sexuality here, where female fingers haveburied themselves through a slit in another woman’s flesh. This is Dickinson ather sadomasochistic best.In The Riddle of Emily Dickinson (1951), Rebecca Patterson boldly argued thatthe person who drove the poet into seclusion with a broken heart was thepossibly bisexual Catherine Scott Anthon, a revolutionary theory even if itmisunderstands Dickinson’s monasticism. Unfortunately, the book preceded thefirst wave of Dickinson scholarship, so it misreads the poems and ends up as afuzzy, schmaltzy novelette. Patterson sees most of Dickinson’s males as Anthonin disguise. I call such literary transsexualism “sexual metathesis” and havefound it in many Romantic writers. Perhaps it is operating at unsuspectedmoments in Dickinson’s poetry. My feeling, however, is that she is moreinterested in masculinizing herself than in masculinizing other women. Theself-projections of boy, prince, and rapist are her favorite transsexual mode.Furthermore, her erotics of Sadean hierarchy require most of her males to bemale—but without any necessary heterosexual desire on her part. At her mostrigorous, Dickinson is a Wildean Apollonian aroused by rank alone, irrespectiveof gender. She is one of the last scholastics of the great chain of being.Psychobiographers like the astute John Cody recognize Dickinson’s lesbiantendencies, but criticism has not assimilated such perceptions into explicationof the poetry. For most scholars, lesbianism is no way to treat a lady. The longconventionalization of Dickinson is epitomized in the early retouching of ourone photograph of the homely poet, who ends up with a frilly white ruff andfluffy Jane Wyman hair. It ludicrously feminizes her uncompromising austerity.Dickinson knew she deviated from female respectability. She says, with her usualrape language: “What Soft Cherubic Creatures / These Gentlewomen are— / Onewould as soon assault a Plush / Or violate a Star” (401). The well-bred ladywith her opulent bosom is half angel, half velvet cushion, materialismmasquerading as virtue. Dickinson’s niece remembered her standing in the upperhall, as women visitors departed, and saying, finger to her lips, “Listen! Hearthem kiss, the traitors!”52 [ch25_notes.html#ch24note52a] In a line like “I likea look of Agony, / Because I know it’s true,” she is using her cheerfulsadomasochism to wipe out the empty tea-table smiles of her modish sex (241).Her homoerotic flirtations were integral to her masculine poetic identity. Tolove like a man is a first step away from social and biologic destiny.Robert Graves declares: “The function of poetry is religious invocation of theMuse…. I cannot think of any true poet from Homer onwards who has notindependently recorded his experience of her.” Male homosexuals, he claims,cannot write great poetry, since their indifference to women severs them fromthe Muse or White Goddess. Women poets are crippled for the same reason: “Womanis not a poet: she is either a Muse or she is nothing.” He denies Sappho was alesbian, blaming the idea on “the malevolent lies of the Attic comedians.”53[ch25_notes.html#ch24note53a] Addled by homophobia, Graves fails to follow hisinteresting theory to its necessary conclusion: Sappho is a great poet becauseshe is a lesbian, which gives her erotic access to the Muse. Sappho and thehomosexualtending Emily Dickinson stand alone above women poets, becausepoetry’s mystical energies are ruled by a hierarch requiring the sexualsubordination of her petitioners. Women have achieved more as novelists than aspoets because the social novel operates outside the ancient marriage of myth anderoticism.Understanding of Dickinson has been hampered by her complex use of sexualpersonae. Her sentimental feminine personae are paradoxically a tool of herpoetic self-masculinization. For Blake, imagination must liberate itself fromfemale nature. For Dickinson, a rare woman Romantic, that femaleness is inherself, which she must jettison to be free. By polarizing nature’s powers intomasculine and feminine, a duality that ensures the destruction of undefendedfemininity, she expels chthonian femaleness from her world. Her Brontëandetachment from her gender makes possible some of her most brilliantinnovations. “‘Twas just this time, last year, I died”; “I heard a Fly buzz—whenI died”: these incredible first lines, like the technical experiments ofWuthering Heights, have been produced by a displacement of point of view comingfrom sexual abstraction and self-estrangement. By no coincidence, it is marriedor marriageable women who fascinate and enamour Dickinson. The femaleness shemakes external to herself she isolates and honors in others. But she must betheir only spouse and child. She makes them sterile with her own desire. Herbeloved women, particularly the volatile, willful Susan Gilbert Dickinson, arethe avatars of the Muse whose presence is indispensable to poetry.Even the best critical writing on Emily Dickinson underestimates her. She isfrightening. To come to her directly from Dante, Spenser, Blake, and Baudelaireis to find her sadomasochism obvious and flagrant. Birds, bees, and amputatedhands are the dizzy stuff of this poetry. Dickinson is like the homosexualcultist draping himself in black leather and chains to bring the idea ofmasculinity into aggressive visibility. In her hidden inner life, this shyVictorian spinster was a male genius and visionary sadist, a fictive sexualpersona of towering force.Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, apparently so dissimilar, are Late Romanticconfederates of the American Union. Both are self-ruling hermaphrodites who willnot and cannot mate. Both are homosexual voyeurs gaming at sexualall-inclusiveness. Both are perverse cannibals of others’ identities, Whitman inhis gluttonous self-engorgements and invasions of the chambers of the sleepingand sick, Dickinson in her ritualistic condolences and lubriciousdeath-connoisseurship. Voyeurism, vampirism, necrophilia, lesbianism,sadomasochism, sexual surrealism: Amherst’s Madame de Sade still waits for herreaders to know her."},{"pageContent":"NOTESCHAPTER 1.
