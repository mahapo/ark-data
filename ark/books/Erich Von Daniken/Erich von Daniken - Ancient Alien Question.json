Our ancestors were clearly not alone.Forty years after Erich von Däniken posed these questions in Chariots of theGods, Coppens provides clear and concise answers to the great historical enigmasin a most accessible and readable format.Your view of human history will never be the same again!Review\"An important and outstanding contribution.\" ---Erich von Däniken, author ofChariots of the GodsAbout the AuthorPhilip Coppens is an internationally renowned investigative journalist, author,and regular contributor to magazines such as Atlantis Rising and NEXUS Magazine.He is labeled a skeptic by the believers, and a believer by the skeptics--aunique position which makes him a well-recognized voice of reason. He is theauthor of six books, including The New Pyramid Age, and is one of the leadingcontributors to The History Channel's popular series, Ancient Aliens. He livesin Edinburgh and Los Angeles, California.Erich von Daniken is arguably the most widely read and most-copied nonfictionauthor in the world. He published his first (and most well-known) book, Chariotsof the Gods, in 1968.

There, among other things, we learned Old Greek and> Latin. Time and again we had to translate texts from the Bible, the Old> Testament, from one language to the other. I read in Genesis: “But when people> started to multiply on the earth, and daughters were born, the sons of God saw> that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took as their wives any> they chose.”> I was confused. What “sons of Gods”? My professor said that this referred to> “fallen angels.” What “fallen angels”? I wondered. Later, we translated the> words of the biblical prophet Ezekiel as he described seeing a vehicle come> out of the clouds with a lot of noise. He described the wings of the vehicle,> its wheels, and even its metal legs. My professor believed that this referred> to a vision, and that Ezekiel had described “God in his chariot.”> Doubts gnawed at my beliefs, and, as a 17-year-old, I wanted to know whether> other cultures in ancient times had similar descriptions to those of the> Christian-Jewish tradition. So while my classmates were playing soccer, I sat> in the university library and read...and read...and read. Soon I understood> that many ancient human traditions contained similar reports to the stories in> the Bible, only with other words and other heroes. Could one believe the> texts?> At that time I decided to take those texts that had been written in the> first-person, as an eyewitness report, to be true. And there were many. Again> and again I encountered descriptions of “gods” who drove around in the clouds,> of beings who came down to earth with “smoke, fire, earthquakes, noise,” and> selected people who had the privilege of being taken to “heaven” by the> “gods.” There, these people experienced a training program. Even artificial> insemination and changes in the genetic code were reported in the old books I> read.> At some point I realized that all these actions were not compatible with the> traditional idea of the “Beloved God.” But when I replaced the word god with> the word extraterrestrial, everything suddenly made sense.> In 1965, I had my manuscript for Chariots of the Gods finished—but found no> publisher. From 24 publishing houses, I got the usual rejection: Sorry...not> suitable for our program...too unprofessional...and so on.> At that time I was director of a first-class hotel in the Swiss ski resort of> Davos. (I come from a restaurant family.) One of my guests, the chief editor> of a German magazine, was friends with the head of the large German publishing> house ECON, and he arranged a meeting for me. Chariots of the Gods thus found> a publisher. In May 1968, the book was #1 on all German bestseller lists.> I gave up my hotel career and devoted myself entirely to my new profession:> researcher of ancient texts and searcher for clues in archaeological ruins.> Chariots of the Gods was a provocative book that had more than 230 question> marks. I had written the book not in a scientific form of writing, but in a> popular one. It contained some errors (unavoidable for a young author). In the> scientific literature it is no different: There, too, one finds errors in> books that are 30 or 40 years old. After all, science is a living thing, and> not a religion, in which one must simply believe. After Chariots of the Gods> there followed a further 28 nonfiction books. I corrected old errors and> misunderstandings in the new books. Today there is for me not the slightest> doubt: Millennia ago, extraterrestrials visited the Earth. These visits became> myths, legends—and also religions.> We should set up new branches of science; for example, a> “Central-American-Indology,” in which the links between the cultures of> Central America and India are examined. Or a “New-Age-Philology,” in which old> texts can be retranslated such that the religious “heaven of bliss” becomes> “the universe” or—depending on the circumstances—“giant spaceship.” Perhaps a> science of the “Chronology of the gods,” in which the unspeakably complicated> information about the gods from antiquity would be investigated in the aim of> finding a common denominator. The questions when and how often the aliens were> here would also be a research objective of the “Chronology of the gods.”> Our limited knowledge of reality is mostly based on the present—quite> understandable, because we live in the “now” and not in “the day before> yesterday.” What happened today, what makes headlines today, concerns us. What> happened yesterday no longer interests us. This fatal short-sightedness robs> us of the sense of historical events. We feel the presence of knowledge as a> culmination of all knowledge from the past. We claim to be the best-informed> society, and accordingly, all our ancestors knew much less than we do.> However, this attitude makes us proud, it makes us rather contemptuously> overlook the past. This is dangerous, because those who do not know history> are doomed to repeat its mistakes. This backward attitude has led historians> and archaeologists to believe little about our ancestors. The astonishing> thing is the smoothness with which this fallacy is implemented in practice: If> an old historian such as the Greek Herodotus, 2,500 years ago, says something> that fits into our current knowledge, then that statement is happily placed on> record. But if the same historian, often on the same page, makes a remark that> does not suit us, we label it false without batting an eyelash, calling him a> liar, an exaggerator; degrading him to the level of an ignorant person who has> not understood anything.> For example, the Egyptologists of our time copied from Herodotus that Pharaoh> Menes (circa 2920 BC) diverted the Nile above Memphis. With closed eyes and> ears is suppressed what the same Herodotus, 18 lines later in Volume 2 of his> Histories, notes: “After Menes followed 330 kings, whose names the priests> read aloud from a book.” The diversion of the Nile and the name “Menes” fit,> but the 330 kings interfere. The same Herodotus, in chapters 141 and 142, also> tells of his visit to Thebes (today’s Luxor). There the priests showed him 341> statues, and the high priest said to each statue a few words. After the visit,> the chief priest assured Herodotus that these 341 statues represented a period> of 11,340 years. At that time the gods had been on Earth in human form. What> did we do with those 11,340 years? They are dislodged, swept off the table,> reinterpreted as a misunderstanding, or read as “lunar years,” although in> Egypt there never was a moon year and Herodotus nowhere used one.> Around 300 BC, there lived in Egypt a high priest named Manetho. He was the> “Scribe of the Holy Temple” and surfaces with the Greek historian Plutarch as> a contemporary of the first Ptolemaic king (304–284 BC). To Manetho are> attributed eight works, including a book on the history of Egypt and the> so-called Book of Sothis, which includes the names and years of the reigns of> the prehistoric kings, dating back to the time of the gods. Manetho wrote that> the first ruler of Egypt was Hephaistos. Then follow Chronos, Osiris, Typhon> (a brother of Osiris), and then Oros (also Horus), the son of Osiris and Isis.> Manetho: “After the gods the family of the offspring of the gods reigned 1,255> years, and in turn other kings reigned 1,817 years. After which are 30 kings,> Memphite, 1,790 years. After which there are others, Thinite, 10 kings, 350> years. And then the kingdom of the offspring of the gods, 5,813 years.”1> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos605174]> The original writings of Manetho are no longer available. But the historian> Julius Africanus and the Church father Eusebius (died AD 339), who, as Bishop> of Caesarea and an early Christian chronicler, was received into the Church> history, copied large parts of Manetho’s work. Here Eusebius expressly noted> that the dates of Manetho were probably lunar years—which, added together,> still account for more than 14,000 solar years.2> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos605301]> Diodorus of Sicily, who lived in the first century BC, was the author of a> 40-volume historical library, in which he reported in the first book that the> old gods “had in Egypt alone, established many cities” that from the gods> descendants had emerged, of which “some of them became King of Egypt.” People> in that distant time were forerunners of Homo sapiens, or a primitive form> that “only the gods had weaned...not to devour each other.”3> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos605419] From the gods the> people learned (according to Diodorus) the arts, mining, the manufacture of> tools, the cultivation of the soil, and the production of wine. Also, language> and writing came from these helpful celestial beings. Diodorus used sources> that are not available to us anymore. He nevertheless knows exactly what he’s> talking about, as in the 44th chapter he compares the Egyptian dates with his> own visit to Egypt: “Over Egypt Gods and Heroes have ruled, not much less than> 18,000 years, and the last divine king was Horus, son of Isis. Of human kings> that have ruled the country by Moeris not much less than 5,000 years up to the> 180th Olympiad, in which I came to Egypt myself.”4> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos605550]> So goes the ancient literature. Worldwide. Always these “impossible numbers”> are cited, which our historians and archaeologists do not want anything to do> with. In a joint effort, we should go over the books and subject the knowledge> of our primal ancestors to a new analysis. To that end, this work by Philip> Coppens is an important and outstanding contribution.> What is it about the Ancient Alien Theory that is important for the human> race? They were here, these aliens, thousands of years ago, and they promised> to return. It is not only ancient cultures that knew the idea of a second> coming, but also the modern, vibrant religions: Christians are waiting for> Jesus, Muslims for the Mahadi, the Jewish community for the Messiah, and so> on. Can every religion be correct? What if all of them are wrong?> This “Shock of God,” as I call it, is preventable. We can prepare ourselves> for the return of the extraterrestrials. All of this has nothing to do with a> new religion. I will turn myself around in my grave if my ideas turn into a> cult. It is not about belief—it is about testing. The facts are there.> Yours sincerely,> Erich von Däniken"},{"pageContent":"Introduction> Have we been visited by extraterrestrial beings in the past? Did these> “ancient aliens” contribute to the birth of human civilization? Do our ancient> monuments contain evidence of their presence?> In 1968, Swiss hotelier Erich von Däniken posed these key questions in his> book, Chariots of the Gods, which sold more than 63 million copies, proving> that millions of people in the Western world were open to the notion that we> might have been visited by extraterrestrial beings. Now, 35 years on, there is> still tremendous popular interest in this “Ancient Alien Question.” The> television series Ancient Aliens is continuously rated as The History> Channel’s most watched documentary. What was originally conceived as a> two-hour special grew into a phenomenon that saw more seasons added, each with> more shows than it had before.> But despite media and public interest, the phrase ancient aliens remains taboo> within the scientific community. Whether or not we were alone in the human> adventure that was early civilization is a question that is still not> answered, or even addressed. The closest topic explored by science is the> Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), executed by a handful of> radio astronomers, each one of whom continuously sees his budget challenged> and then removed because it is perceived to be a niche discipline. Even so,> SETI merely investigates whether there are extraterrestrial civilizations> somewhere out there, in the depths of the universe. It is far less> controversial than the Ancient Alien Question, about which science states that> it knows that there were no alien interventions in our past. Is science right?> In Chariots of the Gods, von Däniken posed more than 230 questions, each one> of them challenging the scientific paradigm of the late 1960s. Demonstrating> that science had not properly explained a given structure, artifact, or> legend, he then queried whether they could be evidence of an alien visitation> or intervention. He pointed at the pyramids of Giza in Egypt, and the> phenomenally intricate walls at many of the Peruvian archaeological sites,> such as Sacsayhuaman, where the most oddly shaped stones, some weighing more> than 100 tons, fit perfectly together, as if first designed on a computer> screen. Questions are also raised by quaint descriptions in the bible, such as> how Lot’s wife could possibly have turned to salt when looking back at Sodom> being destroyed by God. And what are we to make of Genesis 6, where there are> references to giants and “the sons of God” coming down to mate with “the> daughters of men”? The question of alien intervention in our planet’s history> has continued to be posed...and only in the rarest of occasions has science> provided an answer.> “Science”—I use the term occasionally to encompass the entire scientific field> and its members; similarly “archaeology”—feels it should not have to answer> these questions, because, as scientists see it, they are posed by an idiot> (though on occasion science will try to find a nicer word for it). When Erich> von Däniken spoke at Northwestern University in Evanton, Illinois, on December> 2, 1973, he invited the audience to look at the evidence with “today’s> Space-age eyes—not the eyes of yesterday.” During the questions afterward, he> was asked if he had received any academic degrees, to which he replied, “If a> degree were offered in my subject, I would be the professor.” On February 12,> 1975, the University of Bolivia actually bestowed him with the degree of> Honorary Doctor, for his valuable services toward the enrichment of the> academic and scientific heritage of the university, as well as for bringing to> the attention of the world the importance of the archaeological treasures that> exist in the altiplano of the Andes.> What von Däniken wrote in 1968 is the underlying principle of the Ancient> Alien Theory: that we need to re-examine all our archaeological records> through the lens of the late 20th and early 21st century, as we might have> failed to recognize that some ancient structures were built with highly> technological means and/or by, or with the help of, nonhuman intelligences.> Though science as a whole has refused to accept this invitation, individual> scientists have. Dr. Hermann Oberth, the father of modern rocketry, was once> asked about the Ancient Alien Theory, and he replied that he was convinced> that there were other intelligences in the universe, and that they had> probably visited Earth in ancient times. He added, “Most conservative> scientists are against everything that is new, just as they were against my> plans to build rockets that could take man to the moon. Scientists who> considered themselves to be very modern-thinking people announced that man> might reach the moon, but not before many, many thousands of years.”1> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos605716]> Skeptical scholars have claimed that they do not need to look at the Ancient> Alien Question, because von Däniken has been proven wrong. They site certain> ancient sites, like Peru’s famous Nazca lines, hundreds of lines drawn on the> desert sands of Peru, somewhat resembling the layout of a modern airport,> which were hardly explored by scientists at the time von Däniken brought them> to global attention. Could it be an ancient airport?, von Däniken pondered.> The suggestion has since become one of the most famous examples of the Ancient> Alien Question. By posing it, von Däniken forced scientists to study the lines> closely, after decades of neglect. He forced science to come up with an> answer. Though the answer revealed that the Nazca lines were not the product> of an alien civilization or intervention, the investigation did radically> alter science’s understanding of this region and the local civilization,> discovering that it was far more advanced than previously assumed. There is> even speculation that the people who created these geoglyphs between AD 450> and 600 possessed hot air balloons!> On rare occasions such as this, science has addressed the Ancient Alien> Question, but still, at more than 40 years later, most of the 230 questions> posed by von Däniken remain unanswered by science. Worse, science refuses to> pose the question itself, and, almost half a century later, it therefore> remains the task of people outside the scientific community to ask the> question again.> Since 1968, many new archaeological discoveries have been made. Some, like the> pyramid complex outside of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo (discovered in> 2005), have clearly illustrated the standoff between traditional historians> and archaeologists when it comes to discoveries that challenge our accepted> view of history. Western European and American archaeologists even declared a> boycott of the site: They all agreed that they would not provide> archaeological services for the project. I participated in a scientific> conference on these pyramids in August 2008, which was attended by more than> 50 academics, including 20 leading Egyptologists, among them the deans of> archaeology of Ain Shams and Cairo University. During the debates, the> audience was astonished to learn that these leading Egyptologists did not know> that officially the oldest pyramid is now in Peru (dated to 3200 BC, almost a> millennium older than those of Egypt). Neither did they know that the world’s> largest pyramid is in Mexico (Cholula). When the leading archaeologists of our> time do not even know—or can’t accept—the latest scientific findings in their> field, is there any hope that they will ever be willing to address the Ancient> Alien Question?> The answer is a clear no, as can be seen in one of the most famous examples of> the Ancient Alien Question: the Great Pyramid of Giza. Elements of the Giza> Plateau continue to pose serious problems to established archaeologists:> Egyptologists declare that the blocks of the Great Pyramid were hewn from a> nearby quarry, but French scholar Joseph Davidovits strongly disagrees.> Davidovits is internationally known and respected as the father of the new> science of geopolymers. Geopolymerization is a chemical process through which> artificial stone can be created that is almost indistinguishable from natural> rock. This science is considered to be a revolution in the building industry.> Applying this new science to old discoveries Davidovits has identified the> blocks of the Great Pyramid as geopolymers, not natural rock—a conclusion he> has reached through both chemical and observational analyses. However, leading> Egyptologists, such as Dr. Zahi Hawass, misinterpret his conclusion by> thinking that Davidovits is saying the blocks are “cement,” and vociferously> proclaim that the Great Pyramid is clearly not made of cement, and therefore> Davidovits is wrong! Hawass’s approach to new and radical conclusions is> typical of science as a whole when confronted with new discoveries; rather> than trying to respond to a most scientific theory supported by substantial> evidence, Egyptologists prefer to ridicule and push aside this esteemed> scholar. Of course, assuming that Davidovits is right—and he more than likely> is—the next question to be asked is how the builders of the Great Pyramid were> familiar with a chemical science that was only (re)discovered in the late 20th> century. That is exactly the question Egyptologists do not want to hear asked,> for it is automatically followed by the Ancient Alien Question.> Today, hundreds of sites across the world display signs that the history of> these monuments is far more involved than mainstream archaeology would have us> believe. One of the more intriguing locations is Puma Punku, a small> archaeological site that is part of Tiahuanaco on the Bolivian altiplano near> Lake Titicaca. The site comprises stones that are so perfectly assembled that> a razor blade cannot be inserted between them, and some of them weigh more> than 100 tons. Most critically, some stones are very oddly shaped: One block> has a six-sided opening on one side that becomes, on the other side of the> same stone, a five-sided opening. Why anyone wanted or needed a stone with an> opening that goes from a hexagon to a pentagon is a question archaeology has> not posed—maybe because, even in the 21st century, modern science has no need> for such intricate designs. There is also one stone at Puma Punku that has a> 6-millimeter-wide groove containing equidistant drilled holes, which is an> incredibly detailed feature to accomplish even today, and which clearly had> some purpose to the site’s builders 1,500 years ago. Archaeology remains> largely silent about Puma Punku.> The Ancient Alien Question is a worldwide problem. When we look at Cuzco> (Peru), we see intricate walls, some having 12 angles to each stone, on top of> which very basic stones have been piled. It is clear that the lower levels are> of a technologically sophisticated society, predating the Inca civilization,> which used it as a foundation for their own buildings. But which civilization> that was is a question not posed by science.> There is also the gigantic standing stone in Carnac (France). The Grand> Menhir, weighing 340 tons, was cut from a single piece of granite-like rock> and transported “by a means we do not understand for certain,” according to> the site leaflet. Elsewhere, there are three 800-ton stones incorporated into> the base of the Temple of Baalbek in the Lebanon, while one weighing more than> 1,200 tons lies abandoned in a nearby quarry. At the end of the 20th century,> we had equipment capable of lifting up to 2,000 tons, but were still unable to> transport these blocks. This means that the engineers of Baalbek possessed a> technology that surpassed modern capabilities. Archaeology has never been able> to explain how our ancestors were able to accomplish this.> Because archaeology and history are such insular disciplines—always looking> within a culture but never across cultures—a series of pertinent questions are> never asked, let alone answered. For example, why is it that in 2500 BC, the> three pyramids of the Giza Complex in Egypt were laid out in the formation of> Orion’s Belt, and that about two millennia later, the three pyramids of> Teotihuacán in Mexico, on the other side of the world, were constructed> similarly? Clearly, there was a common understanding or an exchange of ideas,> yet science dogmatically states that there was no such contact, and that the> cultures of Egypt and Central America developed completely independently from> each other until Columbus discovered the New World in 1492. Why is it that> cultures that supposedly never met still held gold to be the metal of the> gods, even though gold as such has little practical value or utility? Such> evidence makes it clear that our ancestors communicated far more frequently> than accepted history dictates. At the very least, a group of experts must> have traveled around the world, sharing advanced knowledge among many ancient> civilizations.> In 1968, von Däniken also identified a number of artifacts that in his opinion> were evidence of advanced technology, such as the ancient Baghdad electric> batteries, which have now been proven to indeed be able to hold electrical> charges, and a small bee-like carving that he believed was a tiny> representation of an airplane, which has since been reproduced and is shown to> have perfect flying capabilities.

Many scientists were open to> the possibility that our own solar system contained other life-forms.

It is like the> famous Edison statement that he had found 2,000 ways of not making a light> bulb before he found a way to make one. Sagan was inspired by his> sciencefiction heroes from his youth, who always went farther, pushed> boundaries, and, to paraphrase Gene Roddenberry, boldly went where no one had> gone before.> Sagan was a scientist, and felt that it was his personal mission to educate> the public about scientific methodology. He feared that the public wouldn’t> understand his scientific methods because they seemed more alien than the> intelligence he was searching for. He was horrified when he noticed that the> public adopted “pseudoscience” as a methodology—it provided them clear,> unambiguous answers to the questions everyone had, but for which science did> not have definitive answers. He was thus instrumental in the creation of> CSICOP (The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry), a group of skeptics who can be> seen as the modern-day Inquisition, and who battle what they call> “pseudoscience,” whether that is ufology, the Ancient Alien Theory, astrology,> or parapsychology. But in the end, Sagan became disillusioned with their> methods, arguing that they were just as unscientific.> When NASA began to send missions to Venus and Mars, in an effort to map those> planets, Sagan was there to make sure the missions would educate and inform> the general public.

At first, Sagan’s proposal was not> accepted, but soon enough a camera became a standard feature on missions, to> show the general public on an accessible level what those alien planets looked> like.> It wasn’t until the early 1980s that Sagan became a household name. The> American television channel PBS created a 13-part series produced by Sagan,> called Cosmos, which became the realization of his dream: bringing a> scientific topic into the general household, via the medium most suited for> that purpose—television. Sagan became the host of the series, and it was the> perfect excuse for his scientific colleagues, who had always seen him as being> on the edge of science, to proclaim they felt he was more of a celebrity than> a scientist.

Science, they felt,> had no requirement to be accessible to the general public.> In 1986, Sagan finished Contact. The book was largely autobiographical,> mapping a scientist’s quest to find extraterrestrial life. From the early> 1990s onwards, Sagan knew that his life might not be long-lasting. He suffered> from an illness that only bone-marrow transplants would heal. It created in> him a sense of urgency, and also gave his work a more religious framework. The> opposition between religion, the irrational side of humankind, and science,> the rational opposite, was found everywhere, from the pages of The Demon> Haunted World to the screens on which Contact would posthumously be projected.> Selling the movie itself was a difficult exercise, as its subject was> science—never as popular as science fiction in Hollywood. The movie strove to> convince the public of the importance of the search for extraterrestrial> intelligence, but it starred a single female as the main character.

Eleven years> later, on July 11, 1997, the movie Contact was shown in American theaters; the> following month I would see it in Orlando. Seven months earlier, Carl Sagan> had died in Seattle, following a lung infection. He himself had made an> interdimensional voyage, but unlike the scientist of Contact, he would not> return to tell the tale.Message in a Bottle> Sagan was responsible for three attempts to notify the universe of our> existence: In 1972–3, the Pioneer spacecraft was equipped with plaques of his> design, detailing a diagram of a hydrogen atom; a pulsar map with the sun at> the center, showing the relative distances of 14 pulsars and the binary code> of their periods; figures of a nude man and woman set in front of a to-scale> silhouette of Pioneer; and a sketch of our solar system. Then, in 1974, Sagan,> together with Frank Drake, created the so-called Arecibo Message, in which a> message was beamed into space, aimed at the M13 star cluster. The message> consisted of 1,679 binary digits that, when collected, formed an image of our> little blue planet. The message incorporated the numbers 1 through 10, as well> as the atomic numbers of the elements found in DNA, the formula for DNA, a DNA> helix, and much more information about life on planet Earth. In 1977, Sagan> created the Voyager Golden Records, containing 116 images detailing life on> Earth and methods of finding us, just in case something intelligent were to> stumble upon the little probe.> In the five decades of humankind’s space exploration, we have sent a small> number of these and similar messages into the universe, some riding with our> interplanetary probes, others specifically broadcast via radio to distant> galaxies where we hope someone is listening. At the same time, we have used> our telescopes to listen to anyone out there who might be broadcasting—so far,> without any success. In fact, some scientists believe that an extraterrestrial> intelligence is unlikely to use radio waves to communicate their presence> because radio signals have to compete with background noise and require a> selection of radio frequencies, thus reducing the chances of being discovered.> Instead, it is thought by some, including American physicist Paul LaViolette,> that beacons, sometimes referred to as “galactic lighthouses,” would be built,> announcing to anyone in the galaxy that they are not alone. John Learned of> the University of Hawaii has proposed using the Cepheid variable stars (the> brightest of the “variable” category of stars, which change luminosity through> time) as a beacon, arguing that by manipulating their pulsation cycles, much> like Morse code, the stars could be used to broadcast a message to the> universe that would be far more likely to be received by alien civilizations.> He has outlined a theoretical model as to how this could be accomplished, and> though we currently lack the resources and some of the technology to> accomplish this, future generations might advance as far—extraterrestrial> civilizations might have advanced as far a long time ago.> The idea of galactic lighthouses was originally proposed by Thomas Gold in> June 1968, but has been most popularly promoted in the last decade by Paul> LaViolette. His book, The Talk of the Galaxy: An ET Message For Us?, argues> that some of the pulsars that we have discovered have actually been modified> by an extraterrestrial intelligence, and that our radio telescopes are> therefore picking up an extraterrestrial message; we just refuse to accept it.> The idea that pulsars could be created by an extraterrestrial intelligence> received widespread attention in 1974 with the discovery of PSR 1053+29. Its> extraterrestrial origin was proposed because of its strangely constant> pulsation rate. The pulsar also betrayed no sign of spinning down, which meant> it was not behaving as “normal pulsars” did. Alas, observations of this> specific pulsar throughout the following years showed that it was in fact> slowing down, though at such a slow rate that it still begs the question of> whether it might be an extraterrestrial signal. Since then, more than a dozen> other such pulsars have been identified, and scientists continue to question> whether these are indeed galactic lighthouses, though most scientists believe> that, no matter how weird, we are confronted with a totally natural> phenomenon.> The best candidate for a galactic lighthouse is PSR 1937+21, one of the> fastest pulsars in the sky, flashing 642 times per second, with a very> constant pulsation period. In fact, the beacon surpasses the best atomic> clocks in its precision. The so-called Millisecond Pulsar is also unique in> that it is one of two pulsars known to emit giant pulses, becoming the> brightest pulsar in the sky and therefore making it easily identifiable. After> all, we have identified it, and the only question we have is whether its> period is artificially created or natural, with the usual division between the> two camps.> LaViolette, in The Talk of the Galaxy, states that, “If extraterrestrial> civilizations are attempting to communicate with us and are distinguishing> their transmissions by doing ‘something that can’t be done in nature,’ the> pulsar signals certainly are the closest thing known to fit this criterion.”> But apart from communication, he also points out that the pulsars are ideal> for space navigation, as they provide a means whereby a spacecraft can> determine its position through triangulation. In short, pulsars could be the> echoes of the imaginary network of space portals that Sagan concocted to allow> for interdimensional travel in Contact.Were We Not Alone?> The Ancient Alien Theory proposes that we should not merely be looking into> the deep abyss of space, trying to find out whether contact can be> established, but that contact might have already been established, in the> ancient past, and that physical or other traces of this contact are still> visible or present here on planet Earth.> The theory of evolution suggests that we are the pinnacle of creation, and> science is quick to assume that we are at the pinnacle of civilization.

Immediately we see> one of the three basic ingredients of space travel fulfilled by what> scientists until a few decades ago considered to be primitive societies.> That these societies were not primitive at all is precisely the message Erich> von Däniken beamed into the world in 1968. His medium was not a radio> telescope, but a book, Chariots of the Gods. Though he popularized the topic,> von Däniken did not create the subject. Some of the pioneers of this could-be> science were actually Russian. Nicholas Rynin (1877–1942) graduated from the> Imperial Institute of Communications of St. Petersburg in 1901. After the> Revolution, he wrote a three-volume book called Interplanetary Contacts> (1928–1932), credited as the first encyclopedia on the history and theory of> rocket technology and spaceflight. Less-well-known is that in it he analyzed> ancient legends regarding air and space ships, from the Greek legend of Icarus> to the Hindu Epic of the Mahabharata. He also tackled Jules Verne’s From the> Earth to the Moon and found that the novel’s premise was infeasible. But in> his opinion, the science of the ancient legends was feasible.> Rynin himself was walking in the footsteps of Yakov Perelman, who in 1915> published Interplanetary Journeys, the world’s first book on the science and> technology of spaceflight. Years ahead of Western Europe, Perelman was> popularizing the idea of rocketry and spaceflight for a Russian audience,> resulting in the Soviet Union sending the first man into space in 1961.> Most of the rocket pioneers, including the likes of Hermann Oberth and Werner> von Braun, all wanted to use their rocket technology in the hope that it would> propel humankind into the depths of the universe, and establish contact with> alien life. Instead, their inventions were principally used to fight> terrestrial wars.> Constantine Tsiolkovsky (1857–1935) was probably the first person to realize> that rocket technology was the means by which to travel into space. Along with> Hermann Oberth and Robert Goddard, he is considered to be one of the great> theoreticians of spaceflight. In the early 1930s, Dr. Hermann Oberth was not> shy in attributing the honor of making people dream of exploring the galaxy to> Tsiolkovsky, whom he identified as the father of astronavigation—traveling> toward and through the stars.> In 1928, Tsiolkovsky published Will of the Universe, in which he wrote, “It is> difficult for us to imagine a being superior to earthman. This narrow-minded> view prevents us from picturing an intrusion of extraterrestrial entities in> terrestrial affairs. Yet a great number of events still remain unexplained> because of this attitude. Many curious happenings are recorded in history and> literature.” Tsiolkovsky was “only” a teacher in a provincial town, but he is> considered to be a prophet of science and his papers were often discussed in> the highest echelons of academia. He is considered to be the father of the> multi-stage rocket, as well as the word astronaut.> In an issue of Messenger of Knowledge (Moscow, 1930, Nos. 5–6), Rynin and> Tsiolkovsky spoke out in defense of aliens visiting Earth, with Rynin writing,> “The statement that inhabitants of other worlds have not visited our planet is> indeed corroborated by the accepted history of all countries. However, if we> turn to the tales and legends of hoary antiquity we shall notice a strange> concurrence in the legends of lands separated by oceans and deserts. This> concurrence is contained in the fact that many legends speak of the visitation> of earth by the inhabitants of other worlds in time immemorial. Why not admit> that a grain of truth lies at the bottom of these legends?”> Fully 35 years later, the status quo of the scientific community on the> Ancient Alien Question remained, which is why von Däniken posed it to a> Western audience. Though he was, and is, by far the most popular author in the> field, he was neither the first nor the only one to pose this question to a> Western audience. Italian journalist and writer Peter Kolosimo received the> Premio Bancarella, one of Italy’s most prestigious literary prizes, for Non è> Terrestre (Not of This World). Published in 1968, it was Kolosimo’s fourth> book exploring the mysteries of our planet, the first being Il Pianeta> Sconosciuto (The Unknown Planet), published in 1959.> As mentioned, Carl Sagan, with the help of I.S. Shklovski, devoted a chapter> of Intelligent Life in the Universe (1966) to arguments that scientists and> historians should seriously consider the possibility that extraterrestrial> contact occurred during recorded history. They concluded that:> [images/00031.jpg] Interstellar travel on par with the rocket technology of> the 1960s was within the bailiwick of other extraterrestrial intelligences,> and, as a consequence, extraterrestrial visitations to planet Earth should not> be ruled out—in fact, they were plausible.> [images/00031.jpg] Legends should be seen as reliable sources, and some> legends could indeed describe alien encounters.> In Broca’s Brain (1979), Sagan nevertheless expressed disapproval of von> Däniken, arguing that they had seemingly built on his ideas, not as though> they were guarded speculations, but as valid evidence of extraterrestrial> contact. It seems Sagan did not see the more than 230 question marks in von> Däniken’s book.> Sagan posed the Ancient Alien Question after being exposed to reports of> hundreds of UFO sightings. One writer, Harold T. Wilkins, combed through> ancient literature and legends to find evidence that our ancestors too had> seen anomalous objects in the sky. He published on the subject in 1954, with> Flying Saucers on the Moon. Meanwhile, another British writer, W. Raymond> Drake, went through the same material, scanning it for evidence of ancient> aliens.

We, humankind, were a genetic modification, created for specific> purposes, which was the availability of a workforce on Earth, which the aliens> from the planet Nibiru (the Sumerian name for the 12th planet) had colonized> for its mineral deposits, especially gold.

He argued that the> knowledge the Dogon possessed of Sirius could only have been given to them by> extraterrestrial beings that possessed information on that star system.> As the star Sirius was also the brightest star in the sky and hence the most> important star for the Ancient Egyptians—who based their calendar on it—the> obvious follow-up question was whether the Ancient Egyptians and the Dogon of> Mali were somehow related and/or had somehow shared this very specific> knowledge about Sirius. Temple concluded that the answer was positive.> In 1998, Temple republished the book with the subtitle “New Scientific> Evidence of Alien Contact 5,000 Years Ago.” The book’s reputation was first> dented in 1999, when Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince published The Stargate> Conspiracy, in which they allege that Temple’s thinking had been heavily> influenced by his mentor, Arthur M.

Although he was an anthropologist,> Griaule was keenly interested in astronomy and had studied it in Paris. As> James and Thorpe point out, he took star maps along with him on his field> trips as a way of prompting his informants to divulge their knowledge of the> stars. Griaule himself was aware of the discovery of Sirius B, and in the> 1920s—before he visited the Dogon—there were also unconfirmed sightings of> Sirius C.> The Dogon were well aware of the brightest star in the sky, but, as Van Beek> learned, they do not call it sigu tolo, as Griaule claimed, but dana tolo. To> quote James and Thorpe once again: “As for Sirius B, only Griaule’s informants> had ever heard of it.”12> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos608265] Was Griaule told by> his informants what he wanted to believe, or did he misinterpret the Dogon> responses to his questions? Either way, the purity of the Dogon-Sirius story> is clearly spoiled, and it is highly likely that Griaule contaminated the> Dogon star knowledge with his own. Carl Sagan also believed that this star> lore was not native to the Dogon, but instead had been injected by Griaule> and/or Dieterlen. The same conclusion was reached by Peter James and Nick> Thorpe.> With this, the Dogon mystery and the possibility of alien contact with a tribe> in Central Africa comes crashing down. For more than 20 years, The Sirius> Mystery influenced speculation about the possibility that our forefathers came> from the stars. In his 1998 revised edition, Temple was quick to point out the> new discussions in scientific circles about the possible existence of Sirius> C, which seemed to make Griaule’s claims even more spectacular and accurate.> But it is apparent that Temple was either not aware of Van Beek’s devastating> research, or he decided to ignore it.The Alien Puzzle> The UFO phenomenon and the Ancient Alien Question have often been mixed and> woven into a rich tapestry. The UFO phenomenon is generally agreed to have> begun on June 24, 1947, with a sighting by pilot Kenneth Arnold of nine shiny,> mostly disc-like objects flying past Mount Rainier (in Washington state) at> speeds that Arnold clocked at a minimum of 1,200 miles an hour. Only> extraterrestrials, it was concluded, had technology that could fly at such> incredible speeds. Since then, most UFO researchers have accumulated evidence,> which they see as further confirmation of the extraterrestrial nature of such> phenomena. At the same time, leading ufologists like Jacques Vallee,> especially in Passport to Magonia, and Robert Emmegger, in UFO’s, Past,> Present & Future, have argued that the UFO phenomenon began far earlier than> 1947. Apart from pointing at references in the Bible, such as Ezekiel’s> sighting, Vallee found references from the time of Charlemagne of encounters> with tyrants of the air, and their aerial ships. One record, located by> Vallee, reads:> > One day, among other instances, it chanced at [the French city of] Lyons> > that three men and a woman were seen descending from these aerial ships. The> > entire city gathered about them, crying out they were magicians sent by> > Charlemagne’s enemy to destroy the French harvest. In vain, the four> > innocents sought to vindicate themselves, saying they were their own country> > folk and had been carried away a short time since by miraculous men who had> > shown them unheard marvels. Luckily, the Bishop of Lyons pronounced the> > incident as false, saying it was true these men had fallen from the sky, and> > what they [the town folks] said they had seen there was impossible. The> > people believed what their good Bishop said rather than their own eyes and> > set at liberty the four ambassadors...from the ship.13> > [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos608385]> It shows that encounters with strange ships at a time when humankind did not> fly is not only found in legends, but is a consistent theme throughout our> history, and was a worldwide phenomenon long before 1947.> The UFO phenomenon has grown since 1947, when the only available evidence was> truly unidentified objects that flew, which were sometimes captured on> photographs. These so-called CE-I—Close Encounters of the First Kind—led to> CE-II (in which the object leaves physical traces), CE-III (in which entities> are seen), and CE-IV (the so-called alien abductions). The body of evidence> presented by UFO researchers suggests that an alien intelligence is here and> is interacting with us, and has been for several decades, if not several> centuries. The benign or malign purpose of this interaction depends on the> coloring of the individual researcher. For the late professor of psychiatry> John Mack, “UFO abductees” displayed genuine trauma when he questioned them,> suggesting they had an experience that to them was totally real.

In The Watchers, UFO researcher Raymond E. Fowler> continued his exploration of the intriguing abduction experiences of Betty> Andreasson Luca. From this sole woman’s account, retrieved under hypnosis,> Fowler felt he could argue for the presence of ET on planet Earth. During one> abduction experience, Andreasson noted that she saw a hybrid fetus aborted> from a woman’s womb, “and thrust into a waiting tank of liquid close by. It> was at this time I learned these gray beings were called ‘Watchers’:> caretakers of nature and all natural form. They informed me the reason they’d> been collecting seed and fetuses was because man would eventually become> sterile.” She would later have encounters with “beautiful, pale blue–eyed> extraterrestrials” which she called the Elders, who were apparently in charge> of the Watchers, which were their work force, and which loved the human race.> The abductors’ identification of “The Watchers,” as Fowler noted, meant that> these were the same supernatural or extraterrestrial beings encountered in> numerous legends, as well as the Bible. The Chaldeans referred to the Watchers> as “Ir.” The Egyptian word neter means Watcher. And in the Bible, in Genesis> 6:1–4, they are listed as the sons of Gods who “fell” for the Earthly women,> descended from heaven, chose women, and had children.> Gregory Little was most impressed with Andreasson’s revelations and made a> study of the Book of Enoch, an ancient Jewish religious work, ascribed to> Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah, currently part of the Bible. The Book of> Enoch goes into some depth about the interactions humankind had with these> Watchers. Little observed that the Book of Enoch noted that there were> Watchers present both at the gates of Heaven and Hell—mimicking the Egyptian> neters, who also guarded the gates of Heaven and Hell in the Egyptian> Afterlife. Interestingly, the guardians of Sheol—Hell—were described as beings> “gray of color, small as children, with a shape that is somewhat similar to> the human form.” Little observed that this description was not present in the> Slavic edition of the book (the most commonly used), but was present in the> Hebrew version and was a very good description of “the grays” of UFO abduction> lore. Furthermore, Andreasson had described how the Watchers guarded a door.> Under hypnosis, she stated how she was shown a “Great Door” and how she was> led toward it. The door was an entrance to another world, one of light, of> “home,” which she also described as the abode of “The One God,” whom she> met—though at this point she was unwilling to give further details.> Did the Christian Andreasson confabulate stories she might have heard in her> childhood and weave them into her claims? Perhaps. But it is clear that she is> not the only person who claims to have been abducted. Fowler himself analyzed> the Book of Enoch and came upon an intriguing reference on the general UFO> abduction phenomenon. In his story, Enoch is home alone, resting in a seat,> and falls asleep. Suddenly, he hears talking, though he does not understand> what is being said. Two men appear at the end of his feet; they know his name.> Enoch wakes up, sees the two men, and is afraid. They tell him not to be> afraid, for “you will ascend to Heaven with us.” It is in Heaven that Enoch is> brought in front of “the Elders” and the rulers of a “stellar hegemony.” The> events described by Enoch are identical to the events reported in standard UFO> abductions stories.> True or not, there are important cultural parallels between the story of Enoch> and the modern UFO abduction phenomenon. The Watchers materialized on Earth to> have children with female women. The UFO abductors are said to materialize on> Earth to abduct people, resulting in pregnancies or a general interest in> female genetic material. The consequences of these actions were “giants,” to> use the Enochian language, or “hybrid babies,” to use UFO terminology.> The parallels are there, but what do they mean? Are they ancient legends,> adapted to our modern civilization? Or are they genuine events, written down> both in ancient and modern times? Is history repeating itself? Or are we> merely still intrigued by the same heroic and thrilling stories of our> ancestors?> However intriguing and interesting the parallels between the UFO field and the> Ancient Alien Questions are, the problem is that you cannot answer one> question with another one.

Taken literally, the Bible> states that in those days there were giants on our planet, and it was also at> that time that the “sons of God” introduced themselves to “the daughters of> men,” and had children with them. It clearly reads that this was a meeting of> two species, the “sons of God” being clearly not human, but somehow able to> create offspring with humans.> The Nephilim are sometimes translated as “giants,” sometimes as “fallen,” and> are therefore sometimes identified as the fallen angels. The story goes that> when Lucifer rebelled against God, he was allowed by God to take up residence> on Earth and many other angels followed. The Nephilim were present on Earth> before the Flood, and one interpretation suggests that God caused the Flood to> rid the Earth of the Nephilim, as well as the hybrid creatures the “sons of> God” had created with humankind. However, the Bible also suggests that the> Nephilim were present on Earth after the Flood.> The translation of Nephilim as “giants” comes from the Greek Old Testament,> where Nephilim was rendered as “gegantes,” which looks like giants, but would> actually be Titans. Not coincidentally, the titans were the supernaturally> powerful offspring of the union of gods and humans.> The union of “sons of Gods” and women is indeed not unique to the Hebrew> Bible. There are hundreds of examples in Greek mythology of a Greek god> falling madly in love with a woman. Zeus, the king of the Greek pantheon,> married six times and had numerous affairs with mortal women, including> Semele, the outcome of which was the famous Dionysus. Another of Zeus’s divine> affairs was with Alcmene, resulting in the birth of Hercules. According to> Ovid’s Metamorphoses, her labor lasted seven days and she had great difficulty> giving birth to such a large child.> The Greek myths are usually taken as allegorical, whereas the Bible is often> used for more literal interpretations. The Nephilim, as “fallen,” have been> identified with the Greek Grigori, or the Watchers of Book of Enoch fame, and> have led scholars to argue that the Nephilim/Watchers/Grigori/sons of God are> fallen angels—otherworldly creatures that ended up living on planet Earth> after a dispute with God (or someone who went down on paper as God, but might> not have been the Almighty).> There are other interpretations of this passage, such as the one held by St.> Augustine in the fourth century, which argued that “sons of God” referred to> the line of Seth, while “daughters of men” referred to the line of Cain—two> biblical patriarchs. Still others interpret “sons of God” as meaning a line of> priests—men in the service of God.> Other parts of the Bible also suggest there were indeed giants living on the> Earth. Genesis 14 and Deuteronomy 2 speak of two tribes, the Rephaim and the> Anakim. The Anakim were directly connected with the Nephilim, and were said to> be descended from a giant named Anak. In Numbers 13:33, it is said that this> tribe was so tall that spies who were sent in felt like “grasshoppers, and so> we were in their sight.” Moses is said to have killed Og, king of the Rephaim> and “the last of the remnant of the giants,” according to Deuteronomy 3. Og> had a bed nine cubits long, which, depending on which cubit was used, measured> between 13.5 and 15.5 feet. And we are all familiar with the story of David> fighting Goliath, who was about 9 feet tall. In 2 Samuel 21:20 and 1> Chronicles 20:6 we read of “still another battle, which took place at Gath,”> where “there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each> foot—twenty-four in all,” showing that these giants were clearly described as> being largely human, but having a much larger size, plus extra fingers and> toes. But the giants were clearly of flesh and blood, as many episodes of the> Old Testament detail how the Israelites came upon many of these giants in> Canaan and killed most of them, thus claiming the land of Israel as their own.> In isolation, the passage from Genesis 6 could indeed mean anything, and could> be interpreted literally or symbolically. But placed in a larger context, it> is clear that references to nonhuman or superhuman creatures breeding with> human women is a common theme throughout many myths and legends. One can argue> that all of these should be seen in a symbolic manner, but it is equally valid> to argue that they should be interpreted literally.Biblical Longevity> One of the more intriguing aspects of the Bible is the list of prediluvian> patriarchs and their ages. Methuselah, for example, was said to have lived to> the impressive age of 969 years, though “the First Man,” Adam, lived for a> solid 930 years—respectable for any prototype.> Detailed recordkeeping of people’s dates of birth and death is a relatively> recent—and still largely Western—practice. But from the available records, it> is clear that humankind’s age limit seems to lie somewhere between 115 and 120> years—however few attain it. The oldest attested person on record is the> French Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days, born as she was> on February 21, 1875, and dying on August 4, 1997. Interestingly, this outside> limit is on par with what is said in Genesis 6:3, “his days shall be a hundred> and twenty years.”> The list of biblical patriarchs as given in Genesis 5 goes as follows:> [images/00031.jpg] Adam: 930 years; begetting a son at the age of 130.> [images/00031.jpg] Seth: 912 years; begetting a son at the age of 105.> [images/00031.jpg] Enos: 905 years; begetting a son at the age of 90.> [images/00031.jpg] Cainan: 910 years; begetting a son at the age of 75.> [images/00031.jpg] Mahalaleel: 895 years; begetting a son at the age of 65.> [images/00031.jpg] Jared: 962 years; begetting a son at the age of 162.> [images/00031.jpg] Enoch: 365 years before walking with god; begetting a son> at the age of 65.> [images/00031.jpg] Methuselah: 969 years; begetting a son at the age of 187.> [images/00031.jpg] Lamech: 777 years; begetting a son at the age of 182.> [images/00031.jpg] Noach: 950 years; begetting a son at the age of 500.> Faced with these superhuman ages, the faithful are often encouraged to accept> the veracity of these life spans that far exceed modern man’s life expectancy> as well as anything that the archaeological record have uncovered. For Martin> Luther, these patriarchs had a better diet and sounder bodies, and experienced> a less developed impact of sin on the physical creation, hence allowing them> to live longer. Others have proposed that there was a different climate> prevalent on Earth that would have allowed for these extended life spans. For> those who turn to the Bible for every answer, on this point, it does not> provide an explanation as to why these patriarchs lived so long. As to a “less> developed impact of sin,” the Fall happened during Adam’s lifetime, so the> fact that his descendents still lived long does not seem to have a logical> explanation. The Bible furthermore does not attribute anything special to> these people—except a long life, and living before the Deluge.> Others, in the quest to understand and make the biblical account acceptable,> have tried to reduce these hard-to-imagine life-spans to more mundane> possibilities. One of these interpretations is a lunar solution. This would> mean that to obtain the “real age,” as we calculate someone’s life-span> today—by solar years—their ages need to be divided by 12. This would make> Methuselah just shy of 81 years old when he died. Suddenly, the impossible> seems not only possible, but likely.> This therefore offers an appealing solution to the problem. However, as soon> as one mystery seems solved, a new problem arises: the age at which these> people fathered children.

And that makes the “most logical solution” hard to accept.> When we take the Bible out of its isolation, various parallels once again> become apparent. In ancient Egypt and Sumeria, there are known lists of kings.> Several of these begin with a series of kings who ruled before a flood or, in> the case of Egypt, before the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Some of> these deities lived even longer than Methuselah, to several thousands of> years. In Sumerian accounts we read that the kingship descended from heaven to> Eridu. In Eridu, Alulim became king and he ruled for a staggering 28,800> years. It seems that if Alulim had heard that Adam had died at the age of 930,> he would have said he died in his infancy.> Here is the Sumerian list:> [images/00031.jpg] Alulim of Eridu(g): 8 sars (28,800 years).> [images/00031.jpg] Alalgar of Eridug: 10 sars (36,000 years).> [images/00031.jpg] En-Men-Lu-Ana of Bad-Tibira: 12 sars (43,200 years).> [images/00031.jpg] En-Men-Ana: This name is not present on all lists.> [images/00031.jpg] En-Men-Gal-Ana of Bad-Tibira: 8 sars (28,800 years).> [images/00031.jpg] Dumuzi of Bad-Tibira, the shepherd: 10 sars (36,000 years).> [images/00031.jpg] En-Sipad-Zid-Ana of Larag: 8 sars (28,800 years).> [images/00031.jpg] En-Men-Dur-Ana of Zimbir: 5 sars and 5 ners (21,000 years).> [images/00031.jpg] Ubara-Tutu of Shuruppag: 5 sars and 1 ner (18,600 years).> [images/00031.jpg] Zin-Suddu: This name is not present on all lists.> It’s no wonder that these kings were seen as gods.

He was a> visiting professor at Penn State University, Pennsylvania, from 1989 to 1991,> and has been professor and director of the Geopolymer Institute,> Saint-Quentin, France, since 1979. He is a world expert in modern and ancient> cements, as well as geosynthesis and man-made rocks, and is the inventor of> geopolymers and the chemistry of geopolymerization. He is, in short, a> scientific genius and the expert in his field, sometimes referred to as the> “father of geopolymers.”> These are just the highlights; his CV is longer than most books. But the> reason I list his career’s distinctions is that all of his scientific> credibility has made virtually no dent in Egyptological circles, where> archaeologists have largely disregarded his findings about how the pyramids—or> at least the Great Pyramid—were really constructed. In his expert opinion,> backed up by experiments and analysis, the stones of the Great Pyramid were> not hewn from quarries and then transported; instead, rough stone was> quarried, but then placed in a (wooden?) container with other materials,> causing a chemical process that made what in simple terms some might call> cement, but which in fact is a type of stone that even experts in the field> have a hard time telling apart from natural rock.> From an engineering perspective, this technique would make the construction of> the Great Pyramid much easier: There were no immense limestone blocks to be> moved; there was no real need for a ramp, and the transportation of the stone> material could be done faster, as less care was required in moving the> limestone; it was merely an ingredient, and if it broke, no one cared.> Furthermore, the technique could also explain how the tremendous accuracy in> the construction of the pyramid was achieved—the famous “no cigarette paper is> able to be fitted between two stones.” Rather than figuring out how two hewn> stones were perfectly fitted to each other on site, instead, we would have> wooden molds that were placed next to a completed “block,” upon which “cement”> was poured into the mold, then left to dry, before the next stone was made.> This guaranteed that each one fitted perfectly to the next.> This theory also fits in with the evidence on the ground. Some of the blocks> that were allegedly hewn have large lumps trapped within the mass; others have> wavy strata; others have differences in density between the stones of the> pyramids and the natural stones as located in the quarries; and there is a> general absence of any horizontal orientation of the shells in the pyramid> blocks, when normal sedimentation would be expected to result in shells lying> flat. All of these are telltale signs for an expert like Davidovits that the> stones were cast, not hewn.> For us to accept that the blocks were cast, the only missing ingredient is> whether or not the ancient Egyptians were familiar with such “rock making,” of> geopolymerization.

And furthermore that the ancient Egyptians used the best building> technique ever designed: creating stone blocks that are so identical to> natural rock that, from a chemical position, geologists often cannot tell them> apart! Davidovits is therefore convinced that this method of stonemaking was> the origin of alchemy. He points out that the deity specifically linked with> Khufu was Khnum, which means “to bind,” “to join,” “to cement,” “to unite,”> and which typifies the process of geopolymerization.> Egypt was seen as the birthplace of alchemy, but for Davidovits, it is also> the cradle of chemistry. He argues that certain names, such as mafkat, which> Egyptologists have been unable to translate or explain, were “invented> words”—that is, technical terms—as they described compounds that ancient> chemists had constructed. He believes that when Imhotep is credited as “the> inventor of the art of constructing with cut stones,” it is actually a> mistranslation of the Greek xeston lithon, which does not translate as “cut> stone,” but rather means “the action to polish stone.” For Davidovits, Imhotep> is actually the inventor of working with geopolymers, and it was specifically> for that reason that he was considered to be a god. In short, Imhotep was an> Ancient Egyptian who somehow created a science 4,700 years ahead of his time.> Without this invention, the Egyptian Pyramid Age would not have been. The key> question is, therefore, how Imhotep accomplished this seemingly impossible> feat.> Davidovits believes that Imhotep created two different chemical formulas: a> very simple one for the casting of the limestone core blocks, and another one> to produce the high-quality stones of the exterior layer. The first and major> ingredient in these techniques is soft limestone. Soft limestone can be easily> disaggregated either under pressure or by diluting it in water. To that end,> he writes, “shallow canals were dug in the soft limestone along the Nile,> forming ideal basins for producing large quantities of muddy limestone.> Imhotep’s men began disaggregating the clayish soft rock with its water, until> the lime and the clay separated, forming a mud with the fossil shells at the> bottom.”2 [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos609409] Next, a> substance called natron salt (sodium carbonate) was poured in. Salt is a very> reactive substance that has a petrifying effect, which is why it is used to> avoid the putrefaction of organic tissue by mummification. Natron is found in> great quantities in the desert and in the Wadi-El-Natron (60 miles northwest> of Cairo and named after the substance) and Davidovits has shown that the> ancient Egyptians of the Pyramid Age used it in massive quantities.> Next, more lime, the mineral that binds, was added. Lime is a powdery residue> obtained by burning and reducing to ashes sedimentary rocks such as limestone> and dolomite. The fire oxidizes and converts the rocks into a powdery residue,> which is lime. Lime mixed with natron and water produces a third substance, a> much more corrosive one, which sparks off a strong chemical reaction and> transforms other materials. The water dissolves the natron salt and puts the> lime in suspension, forming caustic soda. Caustic soda is the catalyst Imhotep> needed to trigger off a powerful chemical reaction, one that would produce the> fast integration of silica and alumina.> According to Davidovits, the ancient Egyptians then mixed the ingredients in> the canals until a homogenous binder paste was obtained. Imhotep now had a> water-based cement, which he then had to convert into concrete. For this, he> added more fossil shells, limestone rubble, and silt from the river Nile,> producing a concrete paste, which was carried to where hundreds of small> wooden molds had been prepared. These molds had been smeared with rancid oil> to facilitate the release of the concrete once hardened. The mixture was> rammed into the molds, becoming a dense re-agglomerated limestone, which was> let to dry in the shade, to avoid its cracking under the hot sun.> The preceding description is a proven chemical procedure, but was it known to> Imhotep? For an untrained eye, the process seems terribly complex. How could> it have been known millennia ago?> Davidovits thinks that ancient records have left us clues that this was indeed> the manner in which the pyramids were built, as well as showing the total cost> of the mineral mixing ingredients required in the process. He believes that> this information was actually left behind on the pyramid covering stones and> pointed out to Herodotus when the Greek writer visited Giza. Herodotus> reported that a sum of 1,600 talents, or roughly the equivalent of 150 million> dollars, was spent on garlic, onions, and radishes, which he and everyone else> considered a phenomenal amount of money for what seem to be secondary dietary> requirements for the workforce. As such, the story is taken with...a pinch of> salt, and the argument that Herodotus was lied to by his locally hired tourist> guide. But Davidovits believes that those names (“garlic, onions, and> radishes”) were misinterpretations of what was actually written on the> pyramid. We have to remember that our ancestors mostly referred to substances> based on their colors: “rubber” comes from the Latin word for “red,” as rubber> was red. And so Davidovits argues that these words are not “garlic,” “onion,”> or “radish,” but technical terms whose true meaning had become lost.> Davidovits has used other inscriptions, including several stelae from the> Fourth Dynasty, to show that specific mining venues were exploited during the> Pyramid Age, but that the materials quarried there have no clear purpose> within the traditional methodology of constructing the pyramids—but they do> make sense within his theory.> Is there hard evidence to credit Imhotep and his colleagues of the Third and> Fourth Dynasty with the invention of geopolymers? Perhaps. The Famine Stele,> found on the island of Elephantine in southern Egypt, does describe the> invention of building with stone through processing different minerals and> ores, which could be chemicals involved in the fabrication of man-made stone.> On the Giza plateau, Davidovits has shown that several stones have weathered> unnaturally: One single block was sometimes left unfinished for the day, and> thus it hardened overnight before being brought to the desired height the> following morning. This meant that one block was made in two phases, with> slightly different materials, and created under different circumstances. Six> millennia later, it means that sometimes the lower section of a stone has> weathered badly, but the higher section has not, even though the stones next> to it do not reveal such lower weathering. Such weathering does not conform to> the traditionalist view of quarried blocks.> There is also circumstantial evidence. For example, we know that the ancient> Egyptians were familiar with cement as such: At several places in the Great> Pyramid, remains of 4,500-year-old cements are found, and are still in> excellent condition. This ancient mortar is far superior to the cement used in> modern buildings, as well as the cement used to restore the ancient Egyptian> monuments—much of which has already degraded and cracked after only 50 years.> Davidovits has gained some acceptance from Egyptologists for his idea that> some Egyptian artifacts, specifically some vases, were geopolymers. Thus, it> is accepted that the ancient Egyptians had the necessary chemical and> technical knowledge (of copper, alkalis, and ceramics) to mold vases in this> way. Davidovits argues, “So if the Egyptians knew how to make such a> high-quality cement for vases and statues, what was there to stop them adding> aggregates such as fossil shells to produce a high-performance reagglomerated> limestone? Clearly, nothing.”3> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos609530]> The most recent support (and headlines) for Davidovits’s findings has come> from Linn W.

What Crowhurst realized, for example in Le Menec, was that the short> side of this rectangle was aligned perfectly north–south, and the stone rows> were aligned along the diagonal of this rectangle. This insight revealed> Carnac’s master plan, which is marked by an extreme accuracy in design and> planning, whereby its builders used advanced mathematics, and were also able> to plot and measure pieces of land over distances of several miles, before> they began to place thousands of megaliths. In short, the region of Carnac was> carefully mapped, measured, and plotted, so that these stone rows would be> accurately directed to certain lunar, solar, and maybe other astronomical> phenomena—likely some that are not yet discovered.> This means that our ancestors could plan almost to the inch plots of lands> that stretch for several miles. In his analysis of Carnac, Crowhurst confirmed> that this civilization used the so-called megalithic yard. This megalithic> yard was first proposed by Professor Alexander Thom, who made detailed surveys> of 600 megalithic sites in Britain, Ireland, and France. The megalithic yard> is equal to 2.72 feet. Thom also proposed another unit, which he labeled the> megalithic rod, and which was 2.5 megalithic yards. Whereas archaeology is> largely preoccupied with trying to find ammunition with which to attack Thom’s> conclusions, Crowhurst is one of several who have found further evidence of> this unit of measurement. At Kermario, he found that the three most important> stones present were 500 megalithic rods apart. He has measured the Scottish> Ring of Brodnar (on the Orkney Islands, off the northern coast of Scotland)> and found its diameter is 50 megalithic rods, a distance he also found in the> diameter of the stone circles surrounding the Irish megalithic complex of> Newgrange and the two stone circles in Avebury, near Stonehenge.

Some of these documents even give details on the> mechanism of the vehicles. Chapter XXXI of the Samarangana Sutradhara contains> details of the construction of this machine, and it has been found that one> manuscript of this treatise is as old as AD 1610.

In fact, B.G. Talpule wrote a book in Marathi entitled Vimana Kalecha> Sodha in 1907, in which he described the vimana, which he said he had> constructed in 1895.

Clark Erickson, a landscape> archaeologist, was drawn to the numerous forest islands dotted across the> savannah, which he found littered with prehistoric potsherds, similar to the> ceramics found in Terra Preta soil. Some mounds were as much as 54 feet high,> and much of the pottery was on a grand scale as well. Together with his> colleague, William Balée, Erickson realized that the entire region must have> been linked with agriculture, but they needed evidence for their conviction.> They soon found that some of the mounds were still inhabited by indigenous> people and that their language had words for staple crops like maize, as well> as cotton and dye plants. The straight lines they had observed turned out to> be canals for irrigation, next to which were found causeways. These canals> themselves are a masterwork of engineering: The ancient engineers had wedged> diamond-shaped rocks in the bottom of the canals, so that they would remain> free from sediment. The water flow itself would clean the canals, and so a> human agent was not required.> As to the mounds, Erickson’s interpretation is that they were built to offer> protection from floodwaters, with the most sacred buildings always at the> center of the mound on the highest level. There is historical evidence for> this: A Spanish expedition of 1617 remarked on the extent and high quality of> a network of raised causeways connecting villages together.

Orellana reported that the indigenous people used fire> to clear their fields. We know that the Bolivian savannah has also been the> “victim” of fire—though perhaps we should argue that it was “blessed” with> fire. Bruno Glaser has found that Terra Preta is rich in charcoal, which is> incompletely burnt wood. Terra Preta contains up to 64 times more of it than> the surrounding red earth.

Of course, though science may have long forgotten about this> technique, in the highlands of Mexico, these techniques can still be seen at> night, when local farmers set parts of their fields alight. But the science of> Terra Preta is not nearly as simple as that. A simple slash-and-burn technique> does not produce enough charcoal to make Terra Preta. Instead, a> “slash-and-char” technique must have been used. Named by Christopher Steiner> of the University of Bayreuth, this technique does not burn organic matter to> ash, but incompletely, whereby the charcoal is then stirred into the soil.> Carbon is, as mentioned, a key ingredient in this process. When a tree dies or> is cut down, the carbon stored in its trunks, branches, and leaves is> released, but when plants and trees are reduced to charcoal, the carbon> remains in the charcoal, apparently for periods up to 50,000 years, according> to research by Makoto Ogawa. This explains the high levels of carbon in Terra> Preta.> Today, we know that the distribution of Terra Preta in the Amazon correlates> with the places that Orellana reported were zones where farming occurred.> Today, as in the past, Terra Preta holds great promise for the Amazonian> population—as well as other areas of the world—where modern chemicals and> techniques have failed to generate significant food from Amazonian soil in a> sustainable way. Though some of the secrets of this soil have been discovered> and will provide great help to many impoverished regions, some ingredients of> Terra Preta remain unidentified—or at least difficult to reproduce.

The> official version goes that the skull was found in the ruins of Lubantuun in> Belize (then British Honduras) in 1924 during an archaeological survey of the> site. This “Skull of Doom,” as Mitchell-Hedges labeled it, was not referenced> until 1931, and the seven-year gap has been used by skeptics to argue that the> story of its discovery is a lie.> In his autobiography, Danger My Ally (1954), Mitchell-Hedges stated that “The> Skull of Doom is made of pure rock crystal and according to scientists it must> have taken 150 years, generation after generation working all the days of> their lives, patiently rubbing down with sand an immense block of rock crystal> until the perfect skull emerged.” He continued, “It is at least 3,600 years> old and according to legend was used by the High Priest of the Maya when> performing esoteric rites. It is said that when he willed death with the help> of the skull, death invariably followed. It has been described as the> embodiment of all evil.”> So, Mitchell-Hedges associated this crystal skull with the Maya in 1600> BC—when the Maya were not yet around. Noting Mitchell-Hedges’ interest in> finding evidence for a lost civilization of Atlantis, many people have argued> that the skull is therefore a relic of this earlier civilization. You can> imagine what the skeptics have made of this theory.> In 1936, eminent anthropologist G.M. Morant and Adrian Digby, a future Keeper> of the Department of Ethnology at the British Museum, analyzed the> Mitchell-Hedges Skull and argued that it is not of modern workmanship. Digby> wrote, “...in neither case [including the British Museum Skull] is there any> trace of identifiable tool marks, and it is certain that neither specimen was> made with steel tools. On the teeth there is no trace of a lapidary’s wheel> which would betray one or both specimens as being of comparatively recent> origin.”4 [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos611400] This is at> odds with the conclusions drawn by Walsh, who saw clear evidence of tool> marks. She argues that Morant and Digby’s tools were far inferior to hers,> which is true, but what Walsh fails to note is that in the intervening decades> the Mitchell-Hedges skull is known to have been polished by art restorer Frank> Dorland, who is known to have used modern tools. Writing in the journal Man in> July 1936 (Vol. 36), Morant and Digby both commented that the skull’s> detachable lower jaw would have taken the creator—whoever it was—many hundreds> if not thousands of hours of extra work, and that thus there would have to> have been an important reason why the jaw had to be detached—more than purely> artistic reasons.> In 1964, Anna “Sammy” Mitchell-Hedges—the adventurer’s adopted daughter and> custodian of the Skull of Doom—lent the skull to Frank and Mabel Dorland,> famous art experts and restorers. Dorland commenced his study by taking many> photographs from various angles. He also used a binocular microscope to create> a three-dimensional image of the skull. It was during this scientific analysis> that the skull began to reveal a magical dimension.> One evening, Dorland finished his work too late for the skull to be returned> to its vault in the Mill Valley Bank. So he took the skull home, placing it> next to the fire he had lit for the evening. He then noticed how the light of> the fire was reflected through the eyes of the skull. This made him realize> that the skull allowed certain optical effects to be produced—though other> stories state that throughout the evening the house was also a hive of> poltergeist activity.> Dorland discovered that the optical effects were the result of the way the> skull had been carved, which gave him further insights into the precision of> the workmanship. He observed that there was a type of “layering” on top of the> skull, which made it behave like an amplifying glass. The back of the skull> channeled the light through the eye sockets at the front of the head. Although> no one would be able to see what was happening from behind the skull, anyone> looking at the face would perceive a spectacular series of images that would> appear to come from within the skull itself.> Dorland also discovered two holes at the bottom of the skull that are> invisible when the skull is positioned upright. The holes allow the skull to> be swung without falling over. This was a further indication, along with the> detachable jaw, that this skull was not a mere display object but had been> created to perform certain functions: to move, if not pretend to speak (via> the detachable jaw), and to project certain images to the observer standing in> front of it.> In December 1970, Dorland took the skull to the laboratories of> Hewlett-Packard in Santa Clara, California, which was at the time one of the> world’s most advanced centers for computers and electronics. The lab> technicians there were specialists in the production of precision quartz> crystals, which were used in various high-tech instruments. They were> perfectly suited to figuring out how the skull could have been made. One of> their tests revealed that the skull was made out of one piece of> quartz—including the detached jawbone. The lab technicians stated that they> were unable to create a skull like that with the technology available to them.> In 1970.> Their analysis further showed that the skull exhibited three different types> of workmanship, and hence they suggested that work on it was carried out over> three generations, or a period of 60 to 70 years—about half the time> Mitchell-Hedges argued it would have taken to make. The idea that three> generations would have worked day in and day out on creating one skull was an> unlikely scenario, and thus the skull was proposed to have been created with> “unknown technology”—which soon became interpreted as “of alien origin,” or> from a previous civilization that was technologically superior to ours, which> quickly got linked with Atlantis. This was what Mitchell-Hedges had always> claimed: that this skull was physical evidence of a lost advanced> civilization.> Larry LaBarre, one of the testers at Hewlett-Packard, added to his> observations a decade after the 1970 tests. He said that the quartz of which> the skull was made was very hard, measuring nine out of a possible 10 on Moh’s> scale, meaning that only a diamond would be able to cut it. The quartz, though> of one piece, was furthermore composed of three or four growth phases, each> with a different axis. Cutting it would have been extremely difficult, as> hitting upon a new axis might shatter the crystal if the cutter was not> careful. In short, whereas it was easy to say it would have taken 60 to 70> years to make, it could only have been made with diamond tools, and the> slightest error would have shattered the entire object! That some form of> unknown technology was therefore involved in the creation of the> Mitchell-Hedges skull was evident.> But one vital question remained: How did Mitchell-Hedges get it? The skull’s> owner, English adventurer Frederick A. “Mike” Mitchell-Hedges, writes in his> autobiography, “How it came into my possession I have reason for not> revealing”—and he never did. But Mike’s secrecy was not shared by his adopted> daughter, Anna, who inherited the skull from her father upon his death in> 1959. She would state that it was she who found it, in the Mayan city of> Lubaantun (in British Honduras/Belize), on the occasion of her 17th birthday,> January 1, 1924. If true, it begs the question as to why her father was so> reluctant to reveal this rather mundane and innocent discovery.> An analysis of Mitchell-Hedges’ autobiography reveals—very much like a> polygraph test—one area of his life about which he lied. He states that in> 1913, when working for Mike Meyerowitz, a diamond merchant in New York, he> announced that he was leaving for Mexico, and by November 1913, he had made it> to a tiny village a few miles inside the Mexican border, where he was taken> captive by General Pancho Villa’s troops on suspicion of espionage and taken> to the general himself. This account suggests that Mitchell-Hedges must have> been one of the most unfortunate men ever. But his fortune soon changed, for> the general believed Mitchell-Hedges when he said he was not a spy. Indeed,> soon he became a member of Villa’s army, for a period of 10 months.> Already the story is somewhat unbelievable, but some people do have a run of> bad luck, and Mitchell-Hedges may have suffered from a form of Stockholm> syndrome. Then again—imagining the impossible—could he have gone to Mexico> expressly to be captured and to spend as much time, as closely as possible,> with the great Mexican revolutionary? All this theory would require is the> acceptance that Mitchell-Hedges was not a man out for adventure—an Indiana> Jones—but, instead, a James Bond, sent by his government to provide an> insider’s perspective on the Mexican Revolution. Analysts have argued that> Mitchell-Hedges lied about this period of his life, and lying is a prime> attribute for any intelligence operative. Villa fought 15 battles while> Mitchell-Hedges was allegedly with him, yet in Danger My Ally not one of these> campaigns is mentioned. Why leave out details of events with which his> readership would have been more than impressed, especially as it showed how> danger truly was his ally?> One author, Sibley S. Morrill, in Ambrose Bierce, F.A. Mitchell-Hedges, and> the Crystal Skull (1972), has underlined the period of late 1913 to 1914, when> Mitchell-Hedges was with Villa, as the likeliest time for him to have acquired> the crystal skull. He added, without providing further details, that “some> high officials of the Mexican Government are of the unofficial opinion that> the skull was acquired by Mitchell-Hedges in Mexico,” and that it was> illegally removed from the country. This scenario could explain why> Mitchell-Hedges never said how he’d obtained the skull, as well as why his> daughter might have felt it prudent to relocate the place of the skull’s> discovery to a different country—British Honduras (Belize).> A fact that is rarely discussed is that Mitchell-Hedges wrote a novel, The> White Tiger, published in 1931, which tackles the subject of crystal skulls.> The novel is about “White Tiger,” the leader of the Mexican Indians, who turns> out to be an Englishman who was unhappy with his existence in England and> immigrated to Mexico.

The name> Teotihuacán means “place of the gods” or “where men were transformed into> gods,” and was given to the site by the Aztecs.> The central focus of the complex is a series of pyramids: the Pyramid of the> Moon and the Pyramid of the Sun, which, together with the Temple of> Quetzalcoatl, are the axis along which the city developed. The actual central> axis is the Avenue of the Dead, running from the plaza in front of Pyramid of> the Moon past the two other features, and beyond, originally more than two> miles long. It was named “Avenue of the Dead” because of archaeological> discoveries alongside it. Still, the name may betray a mythical aspect, as> ethnographer Stansbury Hagar suggested that the Avenue may be a representation> of the Milky Way—normally seen as a Way of the Soul.> Hagar went further and stated that the entire complex was a map of heaven: “It> reproduced on earth a supposed celestial plan of the sky world where dwelt the> deities and spirits of the dead.”5> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos611559] His conclusions were> in line with those of Hugh Harleston Jr., who mapped the complex in the 1960s> and 1970s and believed that the entire complex was a precise scale model of> the solar system.> If the center line of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl was taken as the position of> the sun, markers laid out northward from it along the axis of the Avenue of> the Dead indicate the correct orbital distances of the inner planets, the> asteroid belt, Jupiter, Saturn (the Sun Pyramid), Uranus (the Moon Pyramid),> and Neptune and Pluto, represented by two mounds further north.

How did the Mayans therefore acquire this knowledge?> Harleston also concluded that the entire site was constructed according to a> system of measurement that he named the STU, for Standard Teotihuacán Unit,> which equals 3.47 feet. This unit features in the length of a side of the> Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon, as well as in the distance> between the two pyramids, showing that the entire complex was carefully laid> out in a very scientific and mathematical manner.

British author Graham Hancock added, “The street was> blocked at regular intervals by high partition walls, at the foot of which the> remains of well-made sluices could clearly be seen. Moreover, the lie of the> land would have facilitated a north-south hydraulic flow since the base of the> Moon Pyramid stood on ground that was approximately 100 feet higher than the> area in front of the Citadel.”6> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos611717]> The Teotihuacán mapping project demonstrated that there were a series of> canals and waterways that formed a network between the city and ran to Lake> Texcoco, currently 10 miles away, but possibly closer in antiquity. Was it> purely for economic reasons, or was it part of “religious engineering”> involving the Avenue of the Dead?> These theories have added to the body of evidence, which suggests that the> master plan for the site was a visual representation of astronomical> knowledge. The Pyramid of the Sun is aligned with a point on the horizon where> the sun sets on May 17th and July 25th, the two days of the year in which the> sun sits exactly over the peak of the pyramid at noon (zenith), uniting the> heavens with the center of the world. This orientation explains the zenith’s> 17-degree deviation from the north-south alignment of the Avenue of the Dead.> At the time of the equinoxes, March 21st and September 21st, the passage of> the sun from south to north resulted at noon in a perfectly straight shadow> that ran along one of the lower stages of the western façade of the pyramid.> The whole process lasts just longer than a minute. It is possible that the> spectacle occurred on all sides, but as only the western side now remains> somewhat intact, it is impossible to draw any further conclusions. The other> sides were excavated up to a depth of 20 feet, by Leopoldo Batres.> Several authors, including Zecharia Sitchin and Graham Hancock, have repeated> each other’s argument that there are major correspondences between the> pyramids of Giza and those of Teotihuacán. For example, the Pyramid of the Sun> is 225 meters (738 feet) wide and 65 meters (213 feet) high, constructed out> of five successive layers of mud. Its ascent is via 242 stairs. This floor> plan is rather close to that of the Pyramid of Khufu at Giza. The Pyramid of> the Moon is much smaller: 42 meters (138 feet) high and 150 meters (492 feet)> wide, yet its summit is as high as that of the Pyramid of the Sun, because it> sits on the site’s highest point. This feature can also be seen in Giza, where> Khufu’s and Khafre’s pyramids reach an equal height, even though one is taller> than the other.> The most obvious comparison, however, is that the layouts of the three> pyramids at Giza and the three main structures of Teotihuacán represent the> Belt of Orion. The Pyramid of the Moon compares with the smallest pyramid on> the plateau; the Pyramid of the Sun compares with Khafre’s pyramid; and the> Temple of Quetzalcoatl, which has the largest ground plan but was never built> into a full pyramid, compares with that of the Great Pyramid. Though there are> individual differences, I would suggest that the same ingredients were used at> both sites, answering to the same general ground plan: to represent the Belt> of Orion, which in ancient Egypt was linked with their mythology and in the> Mayan culture was part of the creation mythology.> On May 17, circa AD 150, the Pleiades star cluster rose just before the sun in> the predawn skies. This synchronization, known as the heliacal rising of the> Pleiades, only lasted for a century or so. It is now suggested that this event> was the reason why the pyramid complex of Teotihuacán was constructed. The sun> and the Pleiades are important in the religious rituals of the Mayans; the> Sun-Pleiades zenith conjunction marked what is known as the New Fire ceremony.> Bernardino de Sahugun’s Aztec informants stated that the ceremony occurred at> the end of every 52-year Calendar Round. The Aztecs and their predecessors had> carefully observed the Pleiades, and the ceremony was performed precisely at> midnight on the night when the constellation was supposed to pass through the> zenith.> The story is in line with the creation myth, which states that the gods> gathered together at Teotihuacán and wondered anxiously who was to be the next> Sun. This conclave occurred at the end of the previous World Age, which had> just been destroyed by a flood. Now, only the sacred fire could be seen in the> darkness, still quaking following the recent chaos. “Someone will have to> sacrifice himself, throw himself into the fire,” they cried; “only then will> there be a Sun.” Two deities, Nanahuatzin and Tecciztecatl, both tried the> divine sacrifice. One burned quickly, the other roasted slowly. Then> Quetzalcoatl manifested himself and was able to survive the fire, ensuring a> new World Age. It is this age that began in 3112 BC and that is to end on AD> December 21, 2012. It is this creation myth in which the “Hero Twins,”> Nanahuatzin and Tecciztecatl, were confronted with a magical skull of the gods> that spoke to them. It is known that Mayan ceremonial sites, like Teotihuacán,> were three-dimensional renderings of the creation myth. It is therefore> logical to conclude that there was a real divine skull present there. A> crystal skull? A related question is therefore whether Batres was the man who> might have sold such artifacts to Boban.> Batres was also involved with another sale, namely that of sheets of mica that> were found between two of the upper levels of the Pyramid of the Sun.

Its economic value was clearly seen to be much> higher than its archaeological value.> More recently, a “Mica Temple” has been discovered at Teotihuacán, but this> time, the mica has remained in situ. The temple sits around a patio about 300> yards south of the west face of the Pyramid of the Sun. Directly under a floor> paved with heavy rock slabs, archaeologists found two massive sheets of mica.> The sheets are 90 feet square and form two layers, one laid directly on top of> the other. As it sits underneath a stone floor, its use was obviously not> decorative, but functional. The question is what possible use the builders of> Teotihuacán could have had for mica.> Mica is a substance containing different metals, depending on the kind of rock> formation in which it is found. The type of mica found at Teotihuacán> indicates a type that is only found in Brazil, more than 2,000 miles away. The> same South American mica was found in Olmec sites. The Olmecs are often seen> as a civilization separate from the Mayans, preceding them, but new thinking> suggests that Olmec is a misnomer and they should really be seen as an early> stage of the Mayan civilization of Central America. It is clear that the> mica’s presence in Teotihuacán involved a lot of effort—and it thus must have> played an important role—but what was that role?

It is> home to enigmatic lines, some measuring 5 miles in length, with one line even> continuing for 40 miles. Situated in an area where it almost never rains—a few> drops per year on average—the lines have been impressively preserved since> they were created almost 2,000 years ago by removing the top soil, thus> revealing the white soil underneath.[images/00041.jpg]The Nazca lines in Peru are one of the billboards for Ancient Alien theories.Their patterns are reminiscent of modern airport layouts, and many tourists aredoing aborted approaches via airplane so they can experience the fullexcitement.> These lines appear in an area that covers more than 300 square miles and come> in various forms and shapes; apart from long lines, there are also depictions> of animals, including an ape, a whale, a snake, and a llama, a human being, a> flower, and many more. But the most prominent features are the lines, etched> here throughout a period of one millennium, from 500 BC to AD 500.> The designs are so vast that little can be seen from ground level. Small> portions are visible, but the entire scope of the Nazca lines is only visible> from the air. The logical question is therefore why this complex was> constructed when it was to all intents and purposes invisible from the> ground—and the people who created it had not yet discovered flight. It was> this quagmire that Erich von Däniken stirred up, suggesting that those who had> constructed the complex did know the secret of flight. He also pointed to the> straightness of the lines: Throughout a distance of 1,500 meters (4,921 feet),> the lines never deviate more than 4 meters (about 13 feet). He also observed> that the complex looked similar to the design of modern airports. Could the> Nazca lines have been an airport for extraterrestrial deities who came to> visit the civilizations of Southern America?> Rather than answer the question with a stern no, scientists preferred to laugh> at von Däniken’s suggestion. As a point in their favor, they were aware that> the ground itself was very uneven and rough, which would mean that any plane> would immediately have a severe accident during landing. So, though it looked> like an airport, it was not. The question remains whether it could be part of> an indigenous cargo cult, the Nazca culture having created the lines because> they had seen their gods build genuine airports.> Today, owners of local airplanes offer tourists the experience of making an> “aborted landing” on the lines: The pilots prepare for a landing as if the> lines are an airport, and just before the landing, the plane pulls up again.> The attraction exists because of the fame that von Däniken’s best-selling> books bestowed on the lines.> Though von Däniken popularized the lines, they were not unknown before his> arrival. Maria Reiche was a German mathematician with an interest in the lines> since shortly after World War II; since the 1950s, she had lived near the> lines in an effort to understand what they meant. For many years, she tried to> bring the lines to the attention of the scientific community. Though she> largely failed where von Däniken succeeded, in retrospect, both Reiche and von> Däniken are now considered to have been pivotal in bringing the lines to> public awareness.> Reiche believed that the lines had an astronomical function: They were there> to determine the position of the stars. Unfortunately, a subsequent scientific> analysis of her theory proved it incorrect; though some lines were indeed> marking astronomical features, the correspondence was nothing outside of the> normal odds: There are a large number of stars and a large number of lines, so> some should be aligned to some stars—by accident. Until her death in 1998,> Reiche nevertheless continued to defend her theory.> Reiche’s biggest preoccupation was the conservation of the lines. She knew> that every touch to the ground, even a normal stroll through the area, left> marks in the surface that remained visible for many years afterwards. Reiche> was therefore appalled to find that the lines had become a tourist> destination—in sharp contrast with the local people, who looked to the> tourists as a new source of desperately needed income. The “aborted landings”> of the pilots made her shiver, fearing one day a plane would crash and destroy> some of the lines. For most of her life, she also found that the local> authorities were not interested in the lines, and she fought to make the lines> a listed national monument. In the end, her struggle proved successful. But> her theory as to what the lines were was incorrect. Von Däniken’s theory of an> airstrip was equally impossible. So where does this leave the Nazca lines?> The problem is simple: If a plane ever did manage to land on the lines, on the> rough terrain, the sheer displacement of air would result in the lines being> blown off. The top soil would once again cover the scraped-off areas, and the> white lines of the soil underneath would disappear. As extraordinary as they> are, and as much work has gone into them, in the end, the Nazca lines are> “just” a bit of sand that was dusted off to reveal the ground below. It is the> extraordinary meteorological conditions that reign in this part of Peru that> have preserved the lines for millennia.> Von Däniken’s idea that the lines should be viewed from the air inspired> travel writer Jim Woodman and balloonist Julian Nott, who theorized that> though an aircraft was unlikely, perhaps a hot air balloon would do.> Remarkably, rock paintings near the lines do show a balloon. Also, at the ends> of several straight lines are blackened rocks, suggesting they had been> fired—perhaps repeatedly. Perhaps they were sites of sacred fires, or perhaps> they were sites where hot air was created to fill a balloon in order to get> liftoff? To test their theory, Woodman and Nott built a primitive balloon,> based on the depictions on an ancient vase. They also used material that would> have been available to the local people. In 1975, their “Condor I” became> airborne. The balloon flew for approximately 20 minutes and covered a distance> of three miles. It was practical proof that the Nazca people could have used a> balloon from which they would be able to see the lines. But “could” does not> mean they did...> British explorer Tony Morrison, who has made extensive expeditions in the> region and knew the theories of von Däniken, Reiche, and many others, realized> that most Nazca enthusiasts were too focused on their own research and paid> too much attention to the lines themselves, and not the features that were on,> along, and near them. Morrison spoke to the local people, who had retained> stories of how their distant ancestors had constructed the lines. He learned> that certain sections of the network continued to be used by the local people> for religious purposes. Perhaps this was the key to unlocking the mystery of> the Nazca lines?> Morrison’s research revealed that the network was a type of cemetery. The> desert area, where nothing could live, where no rain fell, was an area> delineated by the local people for use in contacting their ancestors. This> should not have come as a surprise, if we also know that the local cultures> were in origin shamanic, because contacting one’s ancestors is of primary> importance in shamanic tradition. For the Nazca people the land of the dead> was similar to Earth, but was found in another dimension, contactable by those> equipped with the right techniques, yet invisible to our eyes.

And so, it seems, von Däniken was> at least partially right.> Morrison argued that the lines often converged in certain nodes, from which> they continued. On these nodes and at regular intervals along the lines, small> altars could be found, sometimes little more than a small heap of stones and> earth. Morrison, and later British researcher Paul Devereux, remarked that the> most important aspect of the lines had not been sufficiently focused upon: The> lines were straight. Straight lines were specifically and uniformly linked> with the voyage of the shaman in the Otherworld. Souls were said to only be> able to travel in straight lines. (Similarly, in the Christian tradition,> roads termed “dead straight roads” often linked the church with the cemetery,> in those cases where the cemetery was not immediately next to the church.)> That this road was “dead straight” was no accident; it was because of the> popular belief, found in so many cultures across the world, that the dead> could only travel in straight lines.> When Tomasz Gorka of Munich University in Germany analyzed five geoglyphs near> the city of Palpa, a lesser-known neighbor of the Nazca lines, he found other> lines, in the interior of the trapezoid structures, that were not visible from> the air. He argued that the geoglyphs visible today are only the most recent> stage of a prolonged construction process, during which the whole complex of> drawings was constantly added to, remodeled, obliterated, or changed by use.> As some of the lines produced stronger magnetic anomalies than others, Gorka> and Karsten Lambers of the University of Konstanz in Germany argued that the> soil beneath was compacted by people walking back and forth during prayer> rituals, which would tie in with the known practice of placing ceramic vessels> at key shrines along the lines. The prayer rituals, of course, were linked> with the worship of the dead: The living walked this sacred landscape to> contact their ancestors.> Though this theory seems to explain the straight lines, what to make of the> accompanying figures of animals and other forms and shapes? It is currently> believed that the animals predate the lines. Their size is often massive; one> figure measures 100 feet. Remains of animal sacrifices have occasionally been> found next to these animal images.> Research into this area had been carried out by anthropologist Marlene Dobkin> de Rios, who published a scientific thesis in 1977 on three areas in the New> World where she had found drug-using cultures that had created designs on the> landscape: the Hopewell Indians of Northern America, the Olmecs of Mexico, and> the Nazca culture of Peru. She argued that the animal depictions were magical> protectors—charms—for the shamans. They also acted as tribal boundaries, so> that shamans of other tribes would not enter a certain territory.> Archaeologist Evan Haddingham built upon this research and learned that> similar practices continue to be observed by the local people in and around> Nazca to this very day.> Dobkin de Rios notes that the design of the Nazca lines is also found on> pottery and other objects of the Nazca civilization; they often depicted the> return of a god. But rather than an extraterrestrial being, she argues that it> is the return of the shaman from his sacred duty, the soul voyage. She also> identified the cactus “San Pedro” (Trichocereus pachanoi) as the plant that> induced the shaman’s vision. This plant was also depicted on various pots and> even on ancient temples.> So von Däniken was right when he suggested that the animals and lines had to> be seen from the sky: They were seen during the shaman’s flight, on his voyage> to the Otherworld. Shamanic theory states that the shaman leaves his body and> “floats” or “soars” through the sky, where often the eagle or another animal> is his totem animal—the animal mimics or symbolizes the flight of the soul. He> was right that these lines were an airstrip; they were an airstrip for the> soul to take off to and return from the Otherworld.The Sacred Valley: The Footsteps of Viracocha> Peru is known as the cradle of the Inca civilization, a culture that the> Spanish called “diabolical,” and, until recently, was deemed to have been> primitive. (The Inca civilization was not often included in school curricula> in Western Europe.) Von Däniken posed this central question in the 1960s: If> the Inca were primitive or stupid, how had they been able to create their> often complex buildings, such as Sacsayhuaman or Ollantaytambo, the former of> which has stones weighing as much as 361 tons? These two complexes stand at> altitudes where today the modern tourist has difficulty breathing when> walking, let alone hauling large stone blocks that weigh tons.[images/00055.jpg]The site of Sacsayhuaman, located just above Cuzco, displays some of the largestand most extraordinary stones. The stones have several differently shaped sides,which somehow all fit perfectly together. This techniqe was necessary because ofthe severe earthquakes prevalent in the region. The Inca’s constructiontechnique has proven to withstand these quakes when no other buildings did.> Four decades later, it is now clear that the Inca were not stupid. It has also> become clear that the Inca built upon centuries of knowledge available to> their predecessors all across the continent. They were the last indigenous> group of rulers who had toiled on the land for hundreds of generations, if not> thousands of years. Nevertheless, the question of what their civilization> represented is still largely unanswered. The main work of answering this> question has been carried out by a small number of Peruvian archaeologists, as> well as a certain amount of visiting scientists, but their conclusions have> not yet become common knowledge.> Two key people in this quest to understand the Inca civilization are Fernando> and Edgar Elorrieta Salazar. They have straightforwardly identified that the> Inca civilization considered an area known as the “Sacred Valley” to be the> heart of their civilization. It was sacred because it was linked with the> gods.[images/00029.jpg]The Sacred Valley of Peru descends from Lake Titicaca, via Cuzco andOllantaytambo, to Macchu Picchu and beyond. It was the path walked by thecivilizing deity Viracocha, which is why the valley is sacred. Based on theextraordinary engineering features found in the various monuments, the idea ofan otherworldly interference is not incredible.> The Sacred Valley begins at the Bolivian altiplano around Lake Titicaca,> continues to Cuzco (literally the “navel” of the Inca world), to Macchu> Picchu, the best-known Inca structure, rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911.> Situated at an altitude of 12,000 feet, Lake Titicaca is the highest navigable> lake in the world. It was on an island in this lake, the Island of the Sun,> that the Inca legends state that the creator god, Viracocha, appeared on> Earth, and it was here that Viracocha’s voyage to spread civilization to the> people of this region began.[images/00053.jpg]Lake Titicaca is the highest navigable lake in the world. It is seen as the sitewhere the Inca deity Viracocha emanated on this planet. The borders of the lakehold some of the most extraordinary archaeological sites, speicificallyTiahuanaco and Puma Punku.> In April 2004, I was fortunate enough to follow in the footsteps of Viracocha,> using a lovely single-track train that runs through some of the most> spectacular scenery in the world. From Lake Titicaca, which is so high that it> is physically hard to breathe, the valley descends to 11,155 feet in Cuzco and> 9,186 feet in Macchu Picchu. From here, Viracocha continued on his path,> walking southeast to northwest, until he reached the Pacific Ocean and> disappeared, his mission accomplished.> The legend of Viracocha and how he “walked” the Sacred Valley brings us face> to face with the enigmas of the Inca civilization. The structures that we see> today at Ollantaytambo or Cuzco are reminders in stone of the “Holy Road”> traveled by the Creator God.[images/00016.jpg]Ollantaytambo is built at an altitude that makes it almost impossible to believethat such gigantic stones went into the construction of the temple complex. Butits location here was predicated on the presence of a sacred feature on the hillthat overlooked the site: Its slope revealed a face, which was that of the godViracocha himself.> At Ollantaytambo, the profile of a human being, identified with Viracocha, can> clearly be distinguished in the mountain that overlooks the complex. The> Salazar brothers have furthermore identified that the temple at Ollantaytambo> is aligned to certain notches in that hill, the alignment of which coincides> with important sunrise events in the calendar. This complex contains massive> stones, specifically the so-called Wall of the Six Monoliths, which is> precisely what the name suggests: a wall made up of six gigantic monoliths,> apparently left unfinished, even though this area was the main structure of> the Temple Hill, commonly known as the Fortress because of the gigantic blocks> used in its construction. Parts of this temple were constructed with huge red> porphyry (pink granite) boulders. The stone quarry for this extremely hard> type of stone was 2.5 miles away, on the other side of the valley in which> runs the Urubamba River. Stated that way, it might not sound like much, but> when you are standing on the Fortress and looking in the direction where these> stones came from, it feels like an impossible task. The valley is deep, the> mountain altitude high—just under 9,000 feet. A. Hyatt & Ruth Verrill, in> America’s Ancient Civilizations, sum up the enigma: “How were such titanic> blocks of stone brought to the top of the mountain from the quarries many> miles away? How were they cut and fitted? How were they raised and put in> place? No one knows, no one can even guess. There are archaeologists,> scientists, who would have us believe that the dense, hard andesite rock was> cut, surfaced and faced by means of stone or bronze tools. Such an explanation> is so utterly preposterous that it is not even worthy of serious> consideration. No one ever has found anywhere any stone tool or implement that> would cut or chip the andesite, and no bronze ever made will make any> impression upon it.”[images/00052.jpg]A detail of the hill that overlooks the temple complex of Ollantaytambo. Asection of the hil clearly reveals a face, which has been linked with the godViracocha, the civilizing deity of the Inca.> The stone face of Viracocha towering over Ollantaytambo is the key to why> massive blocks were positioned here; his face shows that the Creator God is> still present, watching over his people. But whereas most attention goes to> the massive stone blocks of the Temple Hill, the Salazar brothers have> identified that in the valley below, the first beam of the sunrise falls on> the so-called Pacaritanpu, the House of Dawn, where the gods became “God.”> This structure is hardly identifiable, unless it is looked upon with the> “right eyes.” At first, there appears to be nothing but a cultivated field> near the river. Though dating from the Inca time period, it is hardly> recognizable as important. But a second glance will reveal that the entire> field portrays a gigantic pyramid; this two-dimensional structure is viewed as> a three-dimensional pyramid. And this is not a mere trick of the eye, as the> position where the sunbeam hits the ground has been clearly and uniquely> marked by a stone structure.> Such subliminal images in the Inca structures are not unique. Elsewhere, the> Inca used the same technique, often in city planning. The Salazar brothers> have identified various animal forms in the hills and designs of Macchu> Picchu. The design of the capital Cuzco is equally ingeniously created to form> the image of a puma, the royal animal. Many of these constructions were> achieved by using a mixture of natural shapes, which were then> augmented—“stressed”—by human intervention, often by creating fields in very> specific shapes.> The notion that sacred geography underlines Inca city planning is not a new> observation. The Jesuit Father Bernabe Cobo, in his book The History of the> New World (1653), wrote about “ceques” in Cuzco. These were lines on which> “wak’as”—shrines—were placed and which were venerated by local people. Ceques> had been described as sacred pathways, similar to the straight lines that can> be found in Nazca. Cobo described how ceques radiated outward from the Temple> of the Sun at the center of the old Inca capital. These were invisible lines,> only apparent in the alignments of the wak’as. The ceques radiated out between> two lines at right angles, which divided the city into four zones and extended> farther out into the Inca Empire, which is how the empire got its name:> Tawantinsuyu, meaning “Four Quarters of the Earth.”[images/00039.jpg]When Macchu Picchu was discovered in 1911, its beauty and majesty made it amust-visit place. Though the stones used in its construction are not as massiveas elsewhere in Peru, its location makes it part of a sacred pattern thatinvolved the wanderings of the civilizing deity Viracocha.> Cuzco was the Inca capital; its original Quechua name was Qosqo, meaning> “navel.” It is here that some of the most impressive stone masonry of South> America is on display. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo were> built on top of the impressive Coricancha (Temple of the Sun), in an effort to> prevent the local population from continuing to worship Viracocha. When the> Spaniards arrived in Cuzco, they saw 4,000 priests serving at the Coricancha.> Ceremonies were conducted around the clock. Little remains of the Coricancha> today, but what is left shows how impressive it was. The granite walls were> once covered with more than 700 sheets of pure gold, each weighing around 4.5> pounds. The courtyard was filled with life-size sculptures of animals and a> field of corn, all fashioned from pure gold. Even the floors of the temple> were covered in solid gold. Facing the rising sun stood a massive golden image> of the sun, encrusted with emeralds and other precious stones. At the center> of the temple was the true navel—the Cuzco Cara Urumi, the “Uncovered Navel> Stone.” This was an octagonal stone coffer covered with 120 pounds of pure> gold.[images/00014.jpg]Remarkable stonework built by pre-Inca people who lived in Peru can be seen invarious locations, but one of the more interesting and accesible sites is thestreets around the Coricancha in the “navel” of the Inca capital of Cuzco.> As at Ollantaytambo, the true miracle of the Coricancha is its massive granite> blocks. A major earthquake on May 21, 1950, caused severe localized damage in> Cuzco. The buildings from the colonial era were affected, but the city’s Inca> architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at> first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but what truly happened> was that the earthquake merely exposed the original granite retaining walls of> the Coricancha. The superiority of these stones is on display in the streets> around the Coricancha. Here, the lower levels of the stones are monolithic and> with complex angles, engineered so as to withstand earthquakes. On top are> smaller stones.

It> is clear that the walls around the Coricancha are evidence of two distinct> building techniques, the foundations showing that whoever built them possessed> advanced engineering knowledge of working with stone, which was clearly lost> by the time the upper layer was built.[images/00002.jpg]When the Spanish Conquistadors discovered the Coricancha, the Temple of the Sun,in the heart of the Inca capital of Cuzco, they stripped all of its walls oftheir gold. Little remains of the temple, but what does reveals theextraordinary workmanship that went into it, including this doorway.> All of these massive building projects were carried out for one reason: This> was the path walked by Viracocha. Modern research has looked at the legend of> Viracocha and the Sacred Valley of the Vilcamayu and Urubamba rivers and has> concluded that the Sacred Valley symbolized the Milky Way.

Still, they sit within a worldwide> phenomenon of creator beings walking the land and sculpting it as they go.> It will take even longer before their influence and novel approach is adapted> and adopted by archaeologists.

In 1973, Erich> von Däniken, at the height of his fame following the success of Chariots of> the Gods, claimed that he had entered into a gigantic subterranean tunnel> system in Ecuador, which he was told spanned the length of the continent.> Surely this was evidence that our ancestors were highly advanced, or that the> builders of this network were extraterrestrial? The structure was believed to> house a library in which books were made out of metal. This in an area where> today there is nothing but “primitive” Indian tribes with no written language.> Is the library evidence of a lost civilization? Or an extraterrestrial> presence on planet Earth?> The story centers around Janos “Juan” Moricz, an aristocratic> Argentinian-Hungarian entrepreneur who claimed that he had discovered a series> of tunnels in Ecuador that contained a “Metal Library.” In a signed affidavit> dated July 8, 1969, he spoke about his meeting with the Ecuadorian president,> where he received a concession that allowed him total control over this> discovery—provided he could produce photographic evidence and an independent> witness that corroborated the discovery of the underground network. Moricz, it> seemed, felt that von Däniken was the best witness he could have.> In 1972, Moricz met with von Däniken and took him to what Moricz claimed was a> secret side-entrance, through which they could enter into a large hall within> the underground complex. Apparently von Däniken never got to see the library> itself, just the tunnel system. Von Däniken included the visit in his book The> Gold of the Gods: “The passages all form perfect right angles. Sometimes they> are narrow, sometimes wide. The walls are smooth and often seem to be> polished. The ceilings are flat and at times look as if they were covered with> a kind of glaze.... My doubts about the existence of the underground tunnels> vanished as if by magic and I felt tremendously happy. Moricz said that> passages like those through which we were going extended for hundreds of miles> under the soil of Ecuador and Peru.”> Then, one of the world’s biggest potential discoveries soon turned sour.> Journalists from the German publications Der Spiegel and Stern interviewed> Moricz, who now denied ever having been in the cave with von Däniken. This> undermined von Däniken’s credibility (though skeptics will argue he had none> to begin with), and, for many, the incident was proof that von Däniken was a> fabricator of lies. But no one pointed out that if von Däniken had been lying,> he would not have left such an easy trail to Moricz. He could have claimed> that he could not reveal the name of his source, and Der Spiegel and Stern> would have been none the wiser. Instead, it seemed that something was amiss> with Moricz, who had landed von Däniken in an international controversy from> which his career never really recovered.> There are in fact several oddities with this story. First, Moricz merely> denied having taken von Däniken there; the existence of the network itself he> did not deny. In Der Spiegel, March 19, 1973, we can read:> Der Spiegel: “How did you discover the [metal] library?” Moricz: “Somebody> took me there.”> Der Spiegel: “Who was this guide?”> Moricz: “I can’t tell you.”> Moricz further stated that the library was guarded by a tribe. So, in short,> Moricz claimed to von Däniken that he had discovered caves, and he showed> these to him. Now Moricz claimed to have seen the caves, having been led there> by a guide whom he could not identify, but denied having taken von Däniken> there. The logical conclusion seems to be that Moricz had shown something to> von Däniken, was now caught by the fact that everyone seemed to know he had> done so, and had to make sure that whoever had shown him did not bear any> grudges against him, no doubt because Moricz himself would most likely have> been asked not to show anyone else the site.> By 1975, the story of the Metal Library had killed the career of a notorious> author, so who would dare to tread in his footsteps?

And before him, Stan Hall, a Scotsman> who wanted to change the status quo of the controversy.> Stanley “Stan” Hall read von Däniken’s book and subsequently befriended> Moricz, who confirmed that he had met von Däniken in 1972 and had taken the> Swiss author from Guayaquil to Cuenca, where they met Padre Carlos Crespi and> saw his collection of enigmatic artifacts.

He was a member of the> audience at the Scottish Saunière Society conferences. He blended into the> background and was unlikely, if not unwilling, to stand out. It was by pure> accident that I found out I knew Stan Hall—the Stan Hall, who furthermore> lived near where I lived at the time. This gave me the opportunity to get a> personal perspective on the story, and resulted in a friendship that lasted> until his untimely death in 2008.> From Hall I learned that, though originally set up to take place in 1977, the> 1976 expedition occurred at a time when von Däniken’s public profile had been> damaged by Moricz—and Hall was apparently about to endorse Moricz’s claim.> This left von Däniken feeling wary about Hall for more than 20 years, until> both men realized they were kindred spirits rather than mortal enemies.> Why did Hall do it? He wanted to create a framework: If there was indeed a> Metal Library, the first step would be to map the site. That was the main and> only goal of the expedition; there was no treasure-seeking. Hall used his> professional expertise as a project manager to create a three-week exploration> of this famous cave: a joint venture of the British and Ecuadorian armies,> supported by a team of geologists, botanists, and other specialists.> So how did Neil Armstrong get involved? “The expedition needed an honorary> figurehead,” Hall said. “The name of Prince Charles, who had recently received> a degree in archaeology, was proposed, but I knew Neil Armstrong had Scottish> connections. My mother was an Armstrong and via another Armstrong in Langholm,> where Neil had been made an honorary citizen, I made contact. Months later, I> got a reply that Neil Armstrong was more than willing to join us on this> mission. It’s when the expedition suddenly became a life’s challenge.”> On August 3, 1976, when the expedition was winding down, Armstrong entered the> tunnel system of the Tayos Cave. The team was officially not looking for a> metal library, and in fact did not stumble upon one. Had they done so, the> discovery would have altered humankind’s perspective on our history and> origins. For Amstrong, it could have been his second great contribution to> humankind’s exploration, but it was not to be. However, the team did catalogue> 400 new plant species as well as a burial chamber inside the cave, in which a> seated body was found. The chamber was later dated to 1500 BC, and it was> believed that at the time of the summer solstice the sun illuminated this> tomb. Both the date and the alignment show that the history of Ecuador is far> older and more intricate than what is officially believed.[images/00004.jpg]Stan Hall (left) and Neil Armstrong at the Tayos Cave basecamp, after Armstronghad entered the cave. If the Tayos Cave had been the location of the MetalLibrary, Armstrong would not only have been the first man on the moon, but alsoamong the first to find evidence of one of the greatest enigmas on this planet.> When the expedition was finished, Stan Hall returned to his day job. Until> 1991, the year Moricz died, the Metal Library continued to elude him. Had it> not been for Hall, the story of the Metal Library would probably have died> there. He knew that Moricz was not the originator of the story, as von Däniken> noted on page 53 [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_009.html#filepos106140] of> his book. In the 1973 interview with Der Spiegel, Moricz confirmed that an> unnamed person had shown him the cave. But who was this person? Hall decided> to track down this third man, who had seemingly disappeared into the shadows.> Hall had a name—Petronio Jaramillo—but nothing more.> “Moricz died in February 1991,” said Hall. “I had a name and a telephone> directory. But there were an awful lot of Jaramillos in Quito. Finally, I> found him—or, rather, his mother. It was September 1991 when she gave me the> phone number of her son. I phoned him. He told me that it had taken 16 years> before our paths crossed. He was willing to meet me, and stated that he needed> three days to fill me in.”> When they met, Jaramillo confirmed that when Moricz arrived in Guayaquil in> 1964, he teamed up with lawyer Dr. Gerardo Peña Matheus. Through> acquaintances, Andres Fernandez-Salvador Zaldumbide and Alfredo Moebius,> Moricz met Jaramillo in Moebius’s house, and from there Moricz ran with> Jaramillo’s story. Hall was annoyed with himself when he realized that various> people had tried to direct him toward Jaramillo as early as 1975, but it took> until 1991 for the two to finally meet.> Jaramillo and Hall realized that had it not been for Moricz, who focused> attention on the Cueva de los Tayos, the 1976 expedition could have resulted> in the discovery of the century—and what a track record for Armstrong it would> have been! And yet also, had it not been for Moricz, the story would never> have come out the way it did. Hall also remembered how he had shown Moricz a> manuscript about the 1976 expedition, which Moricz then point-blank refused to> return. The incident actually ended their friendship, but Hall never> understood why Moricz did it—until 1991, when he realized that the manuscript> mentioned Jaramillo. It was a name Moricz did not want to see published, as he> had confirmed in the 1973 German newspaper interview.> Jaramillo and Hall became friends, though both agreed Jaramillo would not> reveal the location of the site. Still, he was willing to talk in detail about> its contents and any other aspect of it Hall wanted to discuss. From> Jaramillo, Hall was able to learn the true story of the Tayos library—which> was not in the Cueva de los Tayos at all! Jaramillo stated that he had entered> the library in 1946, when he was 17 years old. He was shown it by an uncle,> whose name has gone unrecorded but who was known as “Blanquito Pelado” (a> loving description of the man’s appearance). He was apparently on friendly> terms with the local Shuar population, who invited him to see a secret in> gratitude for the kindness and goodness he had shown toward the tribe. The> story, of course, brings back memories of what likely happened with> Mitchell-Hedges and the Mayan descendents who showed him the cave that> contained crystal skulls.> Jaramillo entered the system at least once after that. On that occasion, he> saw a library consisting of thousands of large, metal books stacked on> shelves, each with an average weight of about 45 pounds, each page impressed> from one side with ideographs, geometric designs, and written inscriptions.> There was a second library, consisting of small, hard, smooth,> translucent—what seemed to be crystal—tablets, grooved with parallel channels,> stacked on sloping shelves of trestled units covered in gold leaf. There were> zoomorphic and human statues (some on heavy column plinths), metal bars of> different shapes, and sealed “doors”—possibly tombs—covered in mixtures of> colored, semiprecious stones. There was a large sarcophagus, sculpted from a> hard, translucent material, containing the gold-leafed skeleton of a large> human being. In short, an incredible treasure.> On one occasion, Jaramillo took down seven books from the shelves to study> them, but their weight prevented him from replacing them. This also meant that> they were too heavy to remove from the library and reveal to the world.> Jaramillo never produced any physical evidence for his claims, which may> explain why he wanted to live in the shadows of this story. He had seen it> with his own eyes, but would anyone else believe it?> Hall did ask him why he never took photographs: “He said that it would not> prove anything,” Hall told me. Still, Jaramillo stated that he had left his> initials in these seven books so that, if the library were ever discovered, it> could be proved that it was he who had entered it.> Jaramillo and Hall wanted to combine forces to see whether the Metal Library> could be opened: One knew the location, and the other had a proven track> record of organizing proper expeditions. First, contact with various> ambassadors and politicians was established; then the scientific community was> brought in. The plan was for Jaramillo to lead the team to the site, where> they would remain for a period of three to four months (during the dry> season), cataloguing the contents of the site and guaranteeing that nothing> went missing. Everything would remain in situ. A report with recommendations> would be the only outcome of this expedition, which would involve UNESCO.> Then, in 1995, Peruvian jets bombed an Ecuadorian military base and the> project had its first setback.> In 1997, Hall used a major anthropology conference to promote the idea of his> expedition. Six anthropologists came to meet him, interested in what he was> trying to accomplish. But that same year, Ecuador’s political regime changed> (in Hall’s opinion, for the worse); Hall felt that his family could not live> in the new political reality, so he moved back to Scotland with them.> Nevertheless, planning for the expedition continued. But in 1998, the> expedition had a major setback: Hall received by telephone the sad news from> the mother of Petronio Jaramillo that he had been assassinated. Was he> murdered because of the plans that were in motion? Life in South America is> cheap, as anyone who has visited or lived there knows, and that day Jaramillo> was carrying a large amount of money on him. He was killed in a street> robbery, close to his home. Random violence stopped one of the world’s biggest> discoveries dead in its tracks.> Now, Moricz and Jaramillo had both died, and Hall was in his 60s. Would he go> it alone and claim the Metal Library for himself? Hall wasn’t a> treasure-seeker, but he knew that the region was a veritable El Dorado, with> gold everywhere; the roads are quite literally paved with it. It’s possible> that the library books are made out of gold—though Jaramillo never spoke of> gold but of “metal” (in fact, it seems copper was an ingredient, as Jaramillo> had seen a green color on the books)—but in any case there is more gold> outside the library than inside. In fact, the reason Moricz was in the region> in the first place was because he held extensive gold concessions; his> interest in the library was not for its monetary value but for its historic> importance.> Though Moricz was not one of them, various treasure hunters did try to open> the cave throughout the years. One of them, Count Pino Turolla, made contact> with Jaramillo in the 1960s through the same channels that later brought> Moricz to him. Turolla was obsessed with Edgar Cayce’s theory of a Hall of> Records, which the American prophet claimed resided under the Sphinx at Giza.> He claimed there were other such halls, each containing evidence of the> existence of Atlantis, elsewhere in the world. For Turolla, the Metal Library> would be absolute proof of Cayce’s prophecies. But Turolla’s attitude> prevented he and Jaramillo from getting along. Turolla pressed Jaramillo for> details that the latter was simply unwilling to offer, so Turolla opted to> search around the Cueva de los Tayos and came up empty-handed.> One active Indiana Jones–type today is Stan Grist, who knew Juan Moricz as> well as his confidante, Zoltan Czellar, also a good friend of Hall.

His> statement was controversial, as archaeologists had catalogued the small> artifact as an insect. The artifact in question is currently on display in the> Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Its explanation states: “Gold> artifact, a stylized insect, from the Quimbaya culture, Antioquia province,> Colombia, ca. 1000–1500 AD.” At one point, replicas of the piece could be> bought from the Smithsonian gift shop.> There are a number of other such “insects,” five in the collection of the Gold> Museum at the Bank of the Republic in Bogota. The “Bogota aircraft” was first> publicized by Ivan T. Sanderson, who thought the artifact represented a> high-speed aircraft. He sought the opinion of a number of aircraft engineers,> who supported his idea. Another stylized “goldflyer” is in the possession of> the Museum of Primitive Art in New York City, where it is identified as a> “winged crocodile.” Dr. Stuart W. Greenwood has tracked down 18 of these> artifacts in museums and private collections, but in all instances,> archaeological officialdom labeled them insects or something similar.[images/00048.jpg]The Goldflyer is one of a series of scale models produced by a team of Germanenthusiasts who demonstrated that the “bees” found in the gold collections ofmany museums were actually planes, as von Däniken alleged.> The standoff between archaeologists and Ancient Alien researchers did not> break until 1994, when three Germans, Algund Eenboom, Peter Belting, and> Conrad Lübbers, decided to create a scale model of the Colombian “airplane.”> They wanted to experiment with its flight capabilities. At the same time, they> began to draw parallels between the features of this artifact and similar> artifacts, which were indeed likely to be bees and insects.> A key point in the debate is that all insects have their wings on the tops of> their bodies. However, there were some golden artifacts, like the one from> Colombia, that had the wings underneath the body—anatomically incorrect, but> valid for an airplane, as we can see on any airport runway, where Boeings and> Airbuses all have under-fuselage wings.> The German trio soon realized that the people of South America were able to> depict insects and other flying animals anatomically correctly, so if this> gold artifact was indeed an insect, then it was an anomaly, and a serious> mistake at that. Eenboom, Beltung, and Lübbers therefore concluded that it> could not be an insect. Their drawings showed that the design of the artifact> corresponded perfectly with the design of a modern jet-engine aircraft—such as> the space shuttle and the supersonic Concorde.> In 1996, they were allowed to photograph all of the “golden airplane”> specimens on display at the Bremen Overseas Museum in Germany. They were also> allowed to measure them and even make impressions of the originals. That same> year, Peter Belting created his first scale model—an area he was well-versed> in. In fact, it was his interest in the field of scale models that had led to> his decision to study the Colombian artifact in the first place. The scale> model was baptized “Goldflyer I.” Built at a scale of 16:1, the plane measured> 35 inches long, with a wingspan of approximately 3 feet. It weighed 1.5> pounds. A propeller was added to the nose of the plane and the wings were> equipped with the necessary flaps and rolls, so that it could take off and> land. Early test flights were a success: The plane had a stable flight path> and was able to make accurate and comfortable landings. In short, the artifact> behaved as a plane was meant to behave, and this was the first demonstrable> evidence that the “bee” was a plane.> Next in the development line was the Goldflyer II.

It shows correct longitudes for the Braziliancoastline, and some researchers even suggest that it shows the correct,pre-glacial coastline of Antarctica, a continent that would only be discoveredthree centuries later.> What about the coastline of Antarctica?

Scientists have made variousattempts to explain these features away, but could it be that they look the waythey do because their ancestors interbred with the survivors of a crashedspaceship, as the Dropa themselves believe?> Closer inspection revealed that each disc was a book, but, upon their> discovery in 1938, nobody possessed the dictionary for this language so no one> was able to read the books.

The change in> weight had allowed the typewriter to print, leaving characters on the paper.> The discs could (sort of) type! Though it was easy to explain what had> happened, how it had occurred was basically impossible. How could a stone disc> change weight? (Apparently Dr. Robin-Evans was unwilling to lose face over the> stunning weight experiment: Though his report had been written in 1947, it was> not published until 1978, four years after his death.)> After his meeting with Professor Lolladorff, Dr. Robin-Evans set course for> the Chinese mountains in search of the Dzopa tribe.

They were afraid. Dr. Robin-Evans managed to reach his> destination and gain the confidence of the Dzopa people. He was provided with> a language instructor who taught him the basics of the Dzopa language. Then,> Lurgan-La, the religious leader of the Dzopa, told him the history of the> tribe. He stated that their home planet was in the Sirius system. Lurgan-La> explained that two expeditions had been sent to our Earth: the first, more> than 20,000 years ago; the second in AD 1014.

Not only was> their height small; their entire appearance could only be described as> strange.> The important question was whether the “Dropa” and the “Dzopa” tribes were one> and the same. But Robin-Evans had apparently been aware of some controversy> regarding that subject. Though “Dropa” was the correct spelling, “Dzopa,” or,> rather, “Tsopa,” was closer to the correct pronunciation of the word. He felt> it would be better to write “Dzopa,” as that was closer to the correct> pronunciation.> There were only two remaining problems: The date on the stone discs, 12,000> years ago, did not coincide with the statements of the religious leader> (20,000 years ago and AD 1014). Furthermore, the discs appeared to contain> statements by non-Dropa tribesmen describing the Dropa, but were supposedly> written by the Dropa. Did some locals intermingle with the Dropa? Or was the> information somewhat garbled?> Were there still descendents of the Dropa? Hausdorf looked into the latest,> 1982 list of recognized national minorities in China and learned that the> Dzopa are not recognized as a minority in their home province, Qinghai. Might> they therefore no longer exist? The list does specify that 880,000 people> making up 25 tribes are not recognized as ethnic minorities. So, the Dzopa> might not be recognized, or they might be listed under a different name, as> the Hanyu-Pinyin transcription “translated” certain names completely> differently from what they were before.> Another mystery with which Hausdorf battled was the name of Tsum Um Nei, a> name that wasn’t Chinese. This fact had led to rumors that the man had never> existed and was a figment of someone’s imagination. But an Asian friend of> Hausdorf told him that “Tsum Um Nei” was a mixture of Chinese and Japanese;> the Japanese pronunciation of the name had been written down in Chinese, the> way a German named “Schmidt” would be named “Smith” in America. “Obviously the> guy was Japanese,” Hausdorf realized, which also explained why the professor> decided to move to Japan after the stone disc controversy—he returned home to> retire.20 [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos614827]> There are several aspects to this story: the strange skeletons; the discovery> of a little-known tribe of dwarf-like beings; the nature and whereabouts of> the discs; and the decipherment of the inscriptions.

This> book details the 1947 expedition of the English scientist Dr. Karyl> Robin-Evans. It is now known that the book was largely science fiction dressed> up as nonfiction, but many people had already decided that the Dropa story was> bogus—especially those who erroneously argue that the book was the first to> mention the “ridiculous” story.

Why? Perhaps it was merely because China was a> Communist nation and any interest in things Chinese was officially discouraged> at the time by Western governments.> However, it was definitely not a hoax—at least not one executed in 1978. The> Berlin-based historian Dr. Jörg Dendl has been able to trace the first mention> of the Dropa story to 1962, when a monthly magazine for vegetarians, Das> vegetarische Universum (The Vegetarian Universe), published an article titled> “UFOs in Prehistory?” in its July edition.

Dr. Dendl found a 1933 clipping about a Chinese confrontation> with dwarflike beings.

What if> we—all life on planet Earth—come from elsewhere? The idea that life did not> originate on this planet is old. One of the first known proponents of> panspermia—as this idea is scientifically labeled—was the Greek philosopher> Anaxagoras, Socrates’ teacher. Anaxagoras claimed that the universe consisted> of an infinite number of spermata, or seeds. He believed these seeds gave rise> to life-forms when they reached Earth. He coined the term panspermia, meaning> literally “seeds everywhere.”> In 1864, Louis Pasteur revived the idea of extraterrestrial origins of life> and found support for his experimental thinking from British physicist Lord> Kelvin and German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz in the 1870s. In the early> 1900s, Swedish chemist and Nobel laureate Svante Arrhenius postulated that> bacterial spores propelled through space were the seeds of life on planet> Earth. British astrophysicist Fred Hoyle and his Sri Lankan student and,> afterward longstanding collaborator, Chandra Wickramasinghe, revived the idea> in the 1970s. Following Hoyle’s death in 2001, Wickramasinghe has remained the> most vociferous proponent of the idea.> Panspermia is directly opposed to the widely held assumption that life> originated and evolved on Earth, without any outside interference, known as> Darwinism, which is the thinking that has invaded all sciences. This is> precisely why the notion of ancient aliens is such a scientifically> controversial subject.> However, the theory of evolution has one major shortcoming, which is its very> starting point. Darwin proposed that life began in a “warm little pond”> somewhere, almost like a geological stove, where some ingredients were> haphazardly thrown together, accidently creating the soup of life. In 1857,> Louis Pasteur showed that microorganisms are always derived from preexisting> microbes, and so life as we know it here on Earth is always derived from life> that existed before. In short, Darwin was wrong, but this did not stop the> Darwinian perspective on the origins of life from continuing to dominate the> Western scientific mindset. The standoff between Pasteur and Darwin is> therefore interesting for the very fact that Darwin’s model was a theory, and> Pasteur’s conclusions were based on scientific, experimental research. Yet for> more than a century, Western science has preferred to believe in and promote a> disproven theory!> The key to panspermia is DNA, for without DNA, there would be no life. Still,> it was only in 1953 that Dr. James D. Watson and Francis Crick discovered the> structure of the DNA molecule, for which they were awarded the 1962 Nobel> Prize for Physiology or Medicine. The discovery showed how incredibly complex> DNA was. Crick has labeled it the best photocopying machine ever.

So where did it come from?> Interestingly, the origins of life on Earth coincided with the last phase of> the accumulation of material coming from comets that were passing through our> solar system. Coincidence? Crick didn’t think so, and therefore concluded that> DNA had come from elsewhere in the universe, thus subscribing to the theory of> panspermia. So in the opinion of the man who had discovered the structure of> life—DNA—life itself was alien.> Crick proposed that DNA had ridden on the tail of one or more meteors and> comets, landing on Earth from somewhere else in the cosmos. Where precisely> DNA had originated from Crick did not postulate. The implication of his theory> was that, because DNA was extraterrestrial, there was a high probability of> coming across DNA-based life elsewhere in the universe that greatly resembled> our own earth-bound life.> Since Crick postulated this theory, other scientists have gone even further> down this line of thinking. NASA astrobiologist Louis Allamandola has> discovered that RNA—very similar to DNA—spontaneously forms in interstellar> space. This means that any object, whether a comet or a meteor, traveling> through interstellar space, would pick up this RNA and bring it back to a> planet. Scientists have always objected to the notion that life could travel> on a meteor or comet, arguing that it would be subjected to intense radiation> and would therefore not survive the ride. But physicist Paul Davies has shown> that if the microbe is inside the meteor, it would be shielded from such> radiation.> An even larger implication of Allamandola’s finding is that the universe> spontaneously creates RNA, which suggests that our universe was somehow> designed to create RNA/DNA-based life—not just on Earth or in our part of the> galaxy, but throughout the entire universe! Life is therefore a universal> imperative. This would mean that the entire universe could be teeming with> DNA-based life. It would mean that life, as it exists on Earth, is not as> unique as we believe, and other planets would contain similar life-forms.> Indeed, the idea that DNA was created elsewhere in the universe and arrived> ready-made on our planet is now extremely likely.

The man responsible for this contact was> Andrija Puharich, and though he is not a household name, he is regarded as the> father of the American New Age movement. Puharich was born in 1918 in Chicago,> of Yugoslavian parents. He graduated from medical school at Northwestern> University in 1947, and his interest was immediately captured by the> paranormal.

It would be a> few years later, in the late 1950s, that he wrote and published two books: The> Sacred Mushroom and Beyond Telepathy. He then disappeared into the background> and apparently worked for a number of years on his favorite topic,> parapsychology, for a secret project of the U.S. government. In the early> 1970s, with the full consent of the U.S. government and as part of a psychic> experiment—most popularly known as “remote viewing”—Puharich traveled to> Israel and returned with Uri Geller, the spoon-bending psychic who would> create so much controversy and to this day is an international celebrity.> That Geller arrived in the United States as part of a secret CIA project was> only officially confirmed in 1994 when the CIA declassified its series of> remote-viewing projects, one of which was named STARGATE. These projects came> about when the CIA learned that the Soviets were experimenting with> psychically gifted people in the hope that they could learn secret, classified> information on the United States and its military capabilities. The United> States felt it could not be left behind in this endeavor and turned at first> to Puharich, and later to Stanford Research International and two physicists,> Russell Targ and Hal Puthoff, to help them create a series of projects that> would explore whether psychic intelligence-gathering could work. Eventually, a> protocol was developed in which a series of coordinates were given to these> psychics—all of them would eventually be employed by the Department of> Defense—in the hope that they could locate information on the target, which> included the locations of nuclear submarines, rockets, and whatever> information the CIA and other intelligence agencies could not gather through> technological means. Where technology failed, the psychics were meant to> provide the answers that were needed. What is also now declassified, but still> little known, is that the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad allowed the CIA> to test Geller in return for a series of satellite images that allowed Israel> to strike back at strategic locations during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.> Because of the controversy that would erupt over Geller from the 1970s onward,> Puharich’s The Sacred Mushroom has received little attention, but it is a most> important book for anyone trying to answer the Ancient Alien Question. In> fact, its subtitle carried the intriguing word doorway: “Doorway to> Eternity”—or, as we would tend to call it these days, a stargate.

In 1954, Puharich received a transcript> from one of Harry Stone’s trances, some of which was in English, some in> Egyptian. “The first time this occurred, Harry had been at Mrs. Davenport’s> apartment in New York. When admiring a gold pendant, in the form of a> cartouche, he had suddenly started to tremble all over, got a crazy staring> look in his eyes, staggered around the room, and then fell into a chair.”3> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos616061]> From this no doubt bizarre-looking spectacle, Puharich was able to deduce that> Stone was “remembering” a previous incarnation, when he was a high priest in> Egypt, at the time of the building of the pyramids.

But in the case of Harry Stone, during a visit by the famous English> writer Aldous Huxley, Stone asked to have the mushroom administered.

This is very remarkable as the literature of the> mycological society of New England records only one previous instance of the> discovery of an amanita in Maine. The effects, when a piece as big as a pin’s> head is rubbed for a few seconds into the skin of the scalp, are quite> alarmingly powerful, and it will obviously take a lot of very cautious> experimentation to determine the right psi-enhancing dose of the mushroom.”4> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos616185]> In 1955, Puharich also heard from Gordon Wasson that a ritualistic mushroom> cult wasn’t only a thing from ancient Egypt, but still existed in Mexico. It> had existed there for hundreds of years, and was still practiced in some> remote parts of the country. Wasson wrote his own book on mushrooms in 1957,> which is considered to be a landmark publication. Two years later, Puharich’s> own book on “magic mushrooms” was published. Shortly after its publication, in> June 1960, Puharich set out for the village of Juquila in the state of Oaxaca,> 200 miles south of Mexico City. Four weeks later, one team member returned> saying all the others were ill, but Puharich was apparently crazy, as he had> gone on alone. The escapade was not appreciated by Puharich’s second wife, as> he was literally risking his life, at a time when he had a pregnant wife and> four children at home.

In the end, ABC> screened One Step Beyond, documenting the expedition locating the mushroom> cult in Mexico, and the ESP tests before and after eating the mushroom, at> Puharich’s home.> Of most importance to the Ancient Alien Question is that Puharich concluded> that the intelligence he contacted was an extraterrestrial intelligence known> as “The Nine.” He identified The Nine with the Nine Principles, which the> ancient Egyptians saw as the ordering principles that controlled the universe.> They were directly linked with their creator deity, Atum. In Ancient Egypt,> control over these Nine Principles was deemed to be instrumental in the> successful rule of a pharaoh: Proper control over them meant that balance> (linked with the deity Ma’at) was maintained and all was well with Egypt, the> world, and the universe. In Ancient Egypt, it was the pharaoh’s task to liaise> with The Nine, meaning that—if Puharich was correct—contact with ancient> aliens was the bailiwick of every pharaoh. As we shall see, it was part of his> job description!> Puharich believed that The Nine were an alien intelligence: not necessarily> physical, but definitely not terrestrial in the most literal sense. The nine> participants in the ritual that summoned them each channeled one entity, which> communicated through them as a collective. Puharich claimed that Geller was> the exception to the rule and that he could channel all nine together.> As Geller’s fame rose, Puharich decided to write a biography of the exploits> of this remarkable psychic. In the book, Puharich mentioned The Nine, but for> reasons that will forever remain obscure, he largely ridiculed them, even> though for several decades before and after he would remain obsessed with> them. Geller himself has always remained silent on what transpired with The> Nine, as he was unconscious throughout the channeling.

According to Puharich, when in contact> with The Nine, they summoned him to UFO fly-pasts and more. Puharich claimed> that he made tape recordings of these sessions, but none have ever been made> public, so it truly is a case of Puharich’s word against the world. Supposedly> Puharich asked The Nine, “Are you behind the UFO sightings that started in the> United States when Kenneth Arnold saw nine flying saucers on June 24, 1947?”> They answered, “Yes.”> According to Puharich, The Nine stated they were from a world called Hoova,> though on occasion, they called themselves Rhombus 4D. They contacted Puharich> and Geller because they had been chosen to prevent war, as well as help steer> the Earth’s fate into a specific direction, which The Nine said was indeed to> their benefit, though it was also for the benefit of humankind. The Nine also> claimed that they were responsible for Geller’s powers, and that the way in> which humankind used Geller would determine whether The Nine’s “program for> Planet Earth” would continue or not. What is apparent from these> communications is that The Nine, whoever they were, were clearly akin to the> Nine Principles of ancient Egypt, in the sense that they were primarily all> about directing the fate of humankind.> Other psychics, such as Phyllis Schlemmer, have since claimed to have> contacted The Nine, too. Schlemmer claims to have spoken to “Tom”—a modern> rendition of the name Atum—who claimed to be the spokesperson for The Nine.> Her story made it into Stuart Holroyd’s Prelude to the Landing on Planet Earth> and the later The Only Planet of Choice. Other Nine contactees are Don Elkins> and Carla Rueckert, who channeled “Ra,” a member of The Nine who declared that> it was he who had built the Great Pyramid. In sessions with Puharich, “Tom”> said the Sphinx was built and named after him.> I would not go as far as to argue that everyone who has channeled The Nine> should be treated with the same respect as Puharich. I have done extensive> research into The Nine for more than a decade, and they are, quite simply, a> complex issue that defies easy categorization. But what can be definitively> said about them is this: It is clear that each culture, whether Mayan,> Egyptian, or 20th-century Western society, was and is in contact with an alien> intelligence, which each time relates messages that are identical in context.> And in the case of the Mayan civilization, there is even archaeological> evidence that shows that the story of The Nine is directly relevant to the> Ancient Alien Question: The Nine are mentioned in an inscription on Monument 6> of the Mayan site Tortuguero, in the Mexican state of Tabasco. The monument> was erected in AD 669 and is one of the very few pre-Conquest sources that> mention the infamous date of AD December 21, 2012.

Still, it is a safe conclusion to make that the> missing word is return. Why? Because other Mayan sources reference the return> of these deities at the ending of each baktun.> There is no doubt whatsoever that the returning deities are the Bolon Yokte> Ku—The Nine. But who are they within a Mayan context? They have variously been> translated as the God of Nine Strides, the Nine-Footed God, Jaguar-Foot-Tree> and Nine-Dog-Tree. They were seen as living in the Underworld and were> generally described as god(s) of conflict and warfare, and are thus linked> with dangerous transition times, social unrest, eclipses, and natural> disasters like earthquakes. It is said that at the end of a baktun, the end of> a cycle, they would abandon their Underworld realm and rise to the Earth’s> surface, where they would do battle with the 13 deities of Heaven.> To further identify what The Nine Support Gods are supposed to be, we need to> consult other sources—in this case, anthropological ones. Such evidence makes> it clear that The Nine Gods were said to have appeared during ceremonies that> were held at the end of each baktun, the last of which occurred in AD 1618,> shortly after the Conquest of Mexico by Spanish troops.> The ceremony of the baktun is described in Chapter 29 of The Book of Chilam> Balam de Chumayel, a Mayan chronicle composed after the Spanish Conquest and> therefore sometimes treated as less interesting by archaeologists, who have> little interest in anthropological material. The book nevertheless provides a> detailed description of the ceremonies that were performed in Merida in AD> 1618, at the end of 12.0.0.0.0. In total, there are 20 acts, each representing> one of the 20 katuns that make up a baktun cycle. After some initial> preparations, in Act 2, the bee god ties the masks of the 13 gods of Heaven to> those people who were going to perform in the ceremonies. The actual baktun> cycle’s end was described in Act 3, whereby The Nine Gods fought, conquered,> and sacrificed these 13 gods; night had conquered day.> The subsequent acts involved rituals to do with the election of the new> officials for the new period, and in Act 12, The Nine Gods sacrifice the Seven> Pacers and count the mats, which is an initial lineup of the candidates for> investiture for the coming era, as a new leader for the Mayan people had to be> chosen; that ruler’s task was to rule and maintain an active “up and downlink”> with the gods. Most importantly, in Act 15, The Nine Gods announce the fate of> the new era. This fate was largely the will of the gods, which the community> had to achieve during the new era, and it reflects what The Nine said in> communications with Puharich.> In short, the baktun ceremony was a series of rituals, focusing on the Nine> Gods and their emanation and rulings. For the Mayans, the ceremonies were> extraordinarily elaborate and were performed within the sacred precincts of> temple complexes, such as Chichen Itza and Teotihuacán. It was, after all, at> Teotihuacán that the first council of these deities had occurred in 3114 BC,> and the temple complex was a three-dimensional rendering of the Creation Act,> for—as in ancient Egypt—the deities that were contacted were linked with the> creator deity. For Puharich, the rituals were performed in the privacy of a> mundane living room, but the end result was nevertheless contact with nonhuman> intelligences that claimed they were the gods that had brought us> civilization—and were responsible for the pyramids.The Pyramid Purpose> The idea that the pyramid was a place of initiation, rather than a gigantic> mausoleum, was very much in vogue a century ago, mainly among people who> adhered to a Masonic ideology. The “pyramid as temple of initiation” debate> was revived in 1982 by the Egyptologist Edward Wente and has been principally> discussed by British author Jeremy Naydler, most prominently in his book> Shamanic Wisdom in the Pyramid Texts. Naydler stated that “While scholars> generally accept that this ‘voluntary death’ was one of the central aims of> the Greek and Hellenistic mystery cults, Egyptology has resisted the idea that> any such initiatory rites or experiences existed in Egypt.” This would make> Egypt unique among all ancient civilizations—by the absence of such practices.> It would mean that Egypt, of all ancient cultures, did not have a religion> that allowed for the spiritual development of the soul—which would be> extremely odd, because all accounts, including several from Ancient Greece,> written down by men who went to Egypt and often were taught in the Egyptian> temples, argue that Egypt was the world’s authority on such practices.> It is precisely this attitude from the Egyptologist—making Egypt into> something that it was not—that has contributed to so many people asking the> Ancient Alien Question. By making ancient Egypt into something that it never> was, the Egyptologists created a fertile soil for outlandish theories, many of> which do not involve extraterrestrial beings, but which are nevertheless> extremely unlikely. To properly answer the Ancient Alien Question, we> therefore need to render Egypt back to what it was.> The answer to the Ancient Alien Question can be found in the Book of the Dead> and the earlier Pyramid Texts. These texts have been overlooked as the obvious> solution because they became a victim of their own child, the Corpus> Hermeticum, a concise and clear synopsis of the religious framework of ancient> Egypt, codified in the third century BC, following the Greek conquest of> Egypt. The texts inspired the alchemists of the Middle Ages, lay at the> foundation of the Italian Renaissance, may be a key to explaining the> symbolism in paintings by Leonardo da Vinci and Sandro Botticelli, and even> contain the earliest reference to the Grail. But above all, the Pyramid Texts> were believed to contain the true—native—message of ancient Egypt, unlike the> Corpus Hermeticum, which was written for a Greek audience.> At the time of their discovery, it was felt that the decipherment of the> hieroglyphic language of the Pyramid Texts—which the ancient Egyptians used as> a sacred language, as it was deemed to be the language of the gods> themselves—would soon reveal ancient Egypt’s true doctrine. But when Gaston> Maspero, the first to publish the Pyramid Texts in translation, summed up his> effort to translate these texts, he confessed that despite trying, he was> unable to discover any profound wisdom in ancient Egypt’s religious doctrine.> The disappointment came because the Pyramid Texts did not contain the doctrine> of the ancient Egyptians, but “only” the rituals, the manuals used in that> religion, through which contact with the gods was established. To put this in> today’s terms, a manual of your television set does not reveal what programs> it shows or what you watch on it, nor what the experience of “television> watching” really is or feels like. The manual will never reveal the joy you> experienced when Goran Ivanisevich finally won Wimbledon, but only how to> increase the volume on your set during those agonizing last few minutes of his> final against Australian Pat Rafter. The Pyramid Texts were just such a> manual, for in ancient Egypt (as elsewhere), the doctrine itself was> apparently never put to print. But in Ptolemaic times, when the Greeks ruled> over Egypt and when most scholars now accept the Corpus Hermeticum was> written, there was a need for Jews and Greeks to learn the religious doctrine> of the Egyptians, to understand the religious life of their neighbors and> compatriots. The doctrine was therefore finally written down, though the> Greeks and the Jews had no need for the rituals themselves, and hence the> Pyramid Texts were not incorporated into the Corpus Hermeticum. Millennia> later, when the mystique of the hieroglyph had lifted, the disappointment of> not seeing the true breadth of the Egyptian doctrine hung over Egyptology as a> black cloud—which is only slowly drifting away.> Though the Pyramid Texts are ancient Egypt’s most extraordinary document, the> fact that they contain rituals on how to contact the gods is not well-liked by> Egyptologists, who would prefer that they contain anything but. Egyptologists> have argued that the Pyramid Texts are the rituals that were said during the> funeral of the deceased pharaoh—a logical conclusion, seeing as they were> originally written down in the pyramids, which Egyptologists believed to be> the tombs of the pharaohs, and later on the coffins of the deceased, thus> clearly showing there is a funerary aspect to these rituals.> But Naydler has shown that the Pyramid Texts in no single instance actually> imply that the king is dead. Naydler has seen phrases in the Pyramid Texts> that suggest that the king is very much alive—physically alive—at the time> when that section of the texts is supposed to be read out. Though it is> therefore without doubt that the Pyramid Texts focus on the king, Naydler> argues that they focus mainly on his role as an active ruler—not as deceased> head of state. The Texts thus become records of the rituals that the king> performed, at key times of his rule, which Naydler has identified as his> coronation and the Heb Sed festivals, which was a renewal of his kingship that> occurred at 30-year (or shorter) intervals. These rites specifically confirmed> the power of the king over this world and the Otherworld, symbolized by his> ability to control the Nine Principles, as well as the union of Egypt and the> Otherworld by the king, through which he established his divine rule over the> land.> In Naydler’s interpretation, the pyramid was built as a temple, and the> inscriptions on its wall were not meant to be read by the funeral cortege, or> by the deceased soul of the pharaoh, but by the living pharaoh, as he> performed these rituals in the interior of the pyramid during key ceremonies.> This would mean that the pyramids of ancient Egypt were—indeed—communication> devices, helping the pharaoh establish contact with the gods, through a series> of rituals.> Though in ancient Egypt maintaining contact with the gods was seen as the> pharaoh’s daily occupation, there were certain occasions, one might say on par> with the baktun-ending ceremonies of the Mayan calendar, that stood out more.> One of these festivals was the Heb Sed festival, and it is this ceremony that> Stone channeled in 1954. As were the baktun-ending festivals, the Heb Sed> festivals were held in temple complexes and involved both public and private> displays and rituals.> The Heb Sed festival is named after the short kilt with a bull’s tail that the> king wore for the culminating rites of the festival. The festival lasted five> days in total and took place immediately after the annual Osiris rites, at the> time when the Nile’s flooding retreated, at the moment of the rebirth of the> land, mimicking the creation of the world—a new age. For the five days> preceding the Heb Sed festival, a fire ceremony called “lighting the flame”> served to purify the festival precincts. But though much of the ceremony was> public in nature, the most sacred parts of the Heb Sed rite occurred in a> secret chamber—and the question is where precisely this chamber was located.> From the reliefs of Niuserre, the Sixth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, we know> that this chamber contained a bed (a couch?), though other depictions show> that in certain cases a sarcophagus was used. Naydler has suggested that this> secret chamber was inside the pyramid and that the pharaohs in fact built> their pyramids because they were specifically linked with their Heb Sed> festivals.> The main purpose of the Heb Sed festival was to confirm that the pharaoh was> still fit to rule; that he was still able to maintain his link with the> Otherworld. Naydler points out that upon a pharaoh’s death, he was meant to> join the gods permanently in the Otherworld, where he would help guide his> successors and Egypt as a whole from the other side. Thus the Heb Sed rituals> were closely linked with the king’s preparedness to make a successful voyage> after death; they were a test run for his ascension to the Otherworld. This> may explain the confusion about why pyramids were seen as tombs and why the> Pyramid Texts were seen as evidence supporting this conclusion.> The fit state of mind that the pharaoh had to be in, both in life and in> death, was known as “akh.” Intriguingly, the pharaoh accomplished this state> in a place known as the “akhet,” which is often translated as “horizon,” but> which should be interpreted as a place of spiritual illumination, which> historian Mircea Eliade labeled an awakening as well as ascension.> Egyptologist Mark Lehner has suggested that this “akhet” is the Giza Plateau,> further supporting the conclusion that the pyramids were linked with this> ceremony.> Naydler titled one of the chapters of his book “The Pyramids as the Locus of> Secret Rites,” where he argues that the Heb Sed festivals were performed in> the pyramids. He notes that there is an obvious contradiction in the fact that> the construction of a pyramid was often abandoned as soon as a pharaoh died.> So, when he was most in need of a tomb, all work on that tomb was stopped? Let> us also note that several pharaohs who did not live long had no pyramids> whatsoever. Djedefra, Khufu’s son, did not live very long, and his pyramid was> never completed—though he clearly died the son of a dynasty of> pyramid-builders extraordinaire who could surely have spared some men to build> at least a small or minuscule tomb for their king. This scenario makes little> sense. Surely the pharaoh’s successor—often his beloved son—on occasion would> desire to have his father’s tomb completed, so that his father could be buried> inside before work commenced on his own pyramid? If the successor was in his> early 20s when he ascended to the throne, there was more than enough time left> before he had to wonder about his own death, as the life expectancy of an> Egyptian pharaoh was not too different from most of us. But each time a> pharaoh dies, construction work on his pyramid is stopped, as if the pyramid> is no longer required now that the pharaoh is dead. In the “pyramid = tomb”> equation, that practice does not make sense.> But the Heb Sed festival is the key to unlocking the true purpose of the> pyramids. The Heb Sed festival was normally to be held for the 30th year of> the king’s rule.

The entirecomplex, both in layout and inscriptions, reveals the true purpose of thepyramids. They speak of a festival in which the pharaoh was said to become onewith the gods, so that his power and character as a proper ruler was proven inthe eyes of the country.> There is also the famous Heb Sed dance, in which the king circumambulated the> courtyard, which represented the country of Egypt—such large courtyards stand> in front of the Pyramid of Zoser, and are also present at the Giza pyramids of> Khufu and his successor Khafre. In the Heb Sed ceremony, the pharaoh would> arrive by boat and moor at the Valley Temple. From there, the procession would> make its way up the causeway, which at the time was actually a covered> walkway, with only a slit in the roof to allow daylight to penetrate. The next> stop would be at the Pyramid Temple, from which entrance to the pyramid would> be the logical—and only available—next step. The “tomb chamber” inside the> pyramid would thus be the secret chamber, with the sarcophagus being the site> where the secret ceremony of the Heb Sed would occur.> What was this ceremony? Details are sketchy, but it was described as the king> unifying the two dimensions: the divine realm of the gods, and Earth. In> mythology, this occurred at a “Mound of Creation,” and the pyramid was> considered to be just that: a place where heaven and earth met, where the> pharaoh communicated with the gods, where he ascended to heaven, and/or where> the gods came down to earth. That the pyramids were therefore landing places> for the gods is literally true, but should not be interpreted physically, in> the sense that their spaceship landed there.> Other aspects of the pyramids confirm that the Heb Sed festival was their> purpose. For example, the Zoser complex incorporated chapels for statues of> visiting gods of the regions of Egypt who attended the ceremony. This fits> with archaeologist Gilles Dormion’s observation that the gallery leading into> the Queen’s Chamber originally had niches for statues; other pyramids have> similar niched corridors, all of which have been found to be empty, and were> therefore interpreted as evidence that tomb robbers had penetrated into the> structure. But, if used for the Heb Sed festival, the niches would only ever> have contained a statue during the festival; afterward the statues returned to> their temples elsewhere in Egypt.> With this interpretation, we have explained the pyramids of Egypt within the> emerging framework that is slowly replacing the outdated Egyptological dogma.> Remarkably, it appears that the rituals and symbols of the Egyptian pyramids> are similar and sometimes identical to their colleagues across the world, such> as the baktun-ending rituals of the Maya. But there is more....The New Fire Ceremony> A series of rituals was also performed at Teotihuacán. They were written down> by Martin Matz of the Mazatec Indians, who had transmitted them for several> centuries within his community before finally committing them to paper. His> text is known as the Codex Matz-Ayauhtla, or “the Pyramid of Fire,” and> describes a series of legends, from the Creation Myth to the New Fire> ceremony. The latter is the finale of the initiatory spiritual journey that is> encoded in the codex. The text underlines the essence of the Maya’s religious> experience, namely that life is a spiritual journey to ascension—a return to> God, the One who created the universe. The text states how the supreme deity,> Tloque Nahauque, manifested itself as three forces: a duality functioning> against a neutral background, from which the four prime elements—earth, water,> wind, and fire—were created.> Matz only wrote the texts after he had made the journey himself; he visited an> initiatory site with his shamanic guide, where he took a hallucinogenic> substance (in his case, mushrooms), entered a cave at a specific moment in the> calendar year, and consequently had visions of a landscape of pyramids,> including one that was dedicated to the moon. The initiate was then taught> about the World Ages and how ascension and World Ages were connected via the> New Fire ceremony, as well as how they were performed every 52 years. The> American author John Major Jenkins has described this as “the ultimate> self-sacrifice that is the ritual death attending the mystic initiation into> divine life...in order to merge with Quetzalcoatl,” who is seen as the> intermediary deity that connects the living with the Creator God Tloque> Nahauque.6 [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos616446]> This New Fire festival was performed at the temple complex of Teotihuacán. The> complex was physically laid out in the pyramid landscape the initiate saw in> his vision.

The cave> is 7 feet high, runs eastward for more than 300 feet, until it reaches a point> close to the pyramid’s geometrical center. Here it leads into a second cave,> which was artificially enlarged into a shape very similar to that of a> four-leaf clover. Each “leaf” was a chamber, about 60 feet in circumference,> containing a variety of artifacts such as slate discs and mirrors.

As it happened, the number of> speakers outweighed the number of attendees. Titled The Incident, the> conference explored phenomena such as UFOs, crop circles, and the wonders of> the mind. The best minds in all three fields had gathered, ufology led by Budd> Hopkins and Jacques Vallee, and the “mind” category presented by the> controversial American writer Terence McKenna and the then almost totally> unknown Swiss anthropologist Jeremy Narby.> At the conference, McKenna proclaimed his famous slogan that UFOs were not> nuts and bolts, as most ufologists believed, and he implied that the> methodology used by UFO researchers in trying to prove the existence of> extraterrestrial beings visiting the Earth was never going to be successful,> pointing to 50 years of documented UFO reports that had led to no solid> conclusions. McKenna believed that UFOs were real, but were not physical> machines. Instead, McKenna proposed that we had to use our minds to explore> and answer the alien question.> McKenna’s emphasis was on the use of hallucinogenic substances, specifically> DMT, or dimethyltriptamine, which he almost single-handedly made famous.> McKenna graduated from UC Berkeley, majoring in ecology, resource> conservation, and shamanism; with his diploma in hand, he set off for India> and later the Amazon, where he studied the native hallucinogenic drugs used in> various South American shamanic traditions. The specific substance he was> after was oo-koo-hé, a plant preparation containing DMT, a chemical naturally> produced by the brain. It is therefore something of a misnomer to call DMT a> hallucinogenic substance, as it does not create a hallucination as such, but> does things to our brain that science at the time did not understand at all,> and therefore hastily labeled a hallucination.> In the Amazon, at La Chorrera, at the urging of his brother Dennis, McKenna> allowed himself to be the subject of a psychedelic experiment led by the local> shaman, which he claimed put him in contact with a nonhuman, other-dimensional> intelligence. Until his death in 2000, McKenna advocated the use of drugs, and> particularly organic hallucinogens such as ayahuasca, which contained DMT, as> it was his conviction that DMT opened a doorway to the Otherworld, the Realm> of the Gods.> He was clear that these drugs should not be used by the masses, but only by> carefully selected individuals, along the model of the Amazonian tribes and> ancient civilizations, in which drug use was carefully regulated and taught,> and largely restricted to a class of priests.> With the rising popularity of UFO abductions in the 1990s, McKenna began to> preach that this phenomenon was linked with what he termed “hyperspace,” and> that the DMT experience was similar if not identical to the abduction> experience, in which he believed the “machine elves of hyperspace,” as he> often called them, were seen as aliens in UFOs. This was merely the latest> form they had taken on, he theorized, after their former manifestations as> faeries, elves, or angels. Whatever we called them, they were real, and they> were to all intents and purposes Ancient Aliens.> In his books, including Food of the Gods, McKenna mapped the history of drug> usage, specifically of DMT and psilocybin, arguing that both substances had> been used throughout the ages in humankind’s efforts to enter another> dimension and speak with these otherworldly intelligences. He believed these> beings had helped humankind throughout the ages, guiding them along the path> of civilization. He argued that the extraordinary and anomalous wisdom that> had often gone into ancient monuments might have been inspired and assisted by> these intelligences. Rather than only a theory, he had a very personal> experience that suggested this had been indeed the case.> From his very first experiences with DMT at La Chorrera, the denizens of> hyperspace had given McKenna a mathematical formula that became known as> “novelty” and “TimeWave Zero.” In McKenna’s opinion, the formula explained the> mathematical construct and nature of time itself. It was said to be a system> that showed how “new things”—novelty—would spring about in our timeline. Time> itself was a fractal wave of novelty—the output from this wave. Time was thus> built around a series of new ideas and paradigm shifts, and, in McKenna’s> opinion, this could explain why our ancestors were so ridiculously preoccupied> with calendars and mapping time.> Whether or not the TimeWave has a foundation in reality remains a question.> Too few people have seriously studied it, and, most problematically, modern> science hardly knows anything about the nature of time. But the extraordinary> importance of the TimeWave for the Ancient Alien Question is that it was> definitely a gift of the gods to humankind, received through McKenna. The> knowledge he received was highly complex and mathematical in nature, so much> so that those who have studied it have been able to see the extraordinary> mathematics—fractals—linked with the formula, even though they are still at a> loss to grasp its full meaning. This phenomenon reveals that human beings are> able to receive advanced mathematical models from an otherworldly source—which> is what we find in the Ancient Alien controversy: that our ancestors had an> extraordinary understanding of mathematics and the cycles of time, on a level> exceeding our ancestors’ and even our own understanding. Those two very> ingredients were paramount in McKenna’s otherworldly revelation of the> TimeWave theory.> McKenna would argue that if cultures across the worlds had built pyramids for> their gods, this was not necessarily evidence of physical contact between> these civilizations or the result of a space-traveling ancient alien. He> believed that the shamans of each culture had entered another dimension, where> they made contact with an intelligence that had been contacted by our earliest> ancestors. When asked, this intelligence had always provided our ancestors> with the required information so that we could advance on our path of> civilization. Various cultures, across time and space, that contacted it,> would always come away with the same message; this is why, for example, there> was such uniformity between pyramid complexes in Egypt and Mexico. McKenna> would have interpreted the invention of geopolymers by Imhotep as that priest> entering in contact with this otherworldly intelligence, which subsequently> gave him the chemical understanding and processes through which to create> geopolymers.> Anthropologist Jeremy Narby was the other speaker at the conference who> impressed me greatly, and I had the absolute pleasure and joy of having> lunches and dinner sitting with both him and McKenna at one table. Narby had> largely followed in McKenna’s footsteps, going where McKenna had not yet gone.> Narby grew up in Switzerland and Canada, studied history at Canterbury, and> received his doctorate in anthropology from Stanford University. Then, he> trekked into the South American jungles, and like McKenna before him, came> away with an understanding that is potentially the greatest revelation in the> history of modern science.> In his youth, Narby had been an aspiring tennis player, but back problems> prevented him from making it his profession. By the time he reached the> Amazon, his back gave him so many problems that he finally succumbed to the> invitations of the local shamans, who told him that they could cure him. Ever> since, his back has not ailed him. It is a similar story to the one told by> one of my guides, when I explored the jungles of Iquitos in 2004: My guide had> been a computer programmer with a true Western mindset, until he fell> seriously ill and could no longer work or provide an income for his family.> Modern medicine could not help him, and as a final act of desperation, he> tried—without any hope that they would offer him solace from his pain—the> local shamans. When they cured him, he changed his profession, focusing on the> tourism industry and telling tourists of the wonders and miracles of the> Amazonian rain forest.> Narby himself left the Amazon with the knowledge that the rain forest is a> veritable chemical lab, containing substances the shamans can mix in a manner> that supersedes the techniques and knowledge of modern pharmaceutical> companies. To demonstrate this, in 1999, Narby took three molecular biologists> to the Peruvian Amazon to see whether they could obtain biomolecular> information in shamanic sessions. The drug of choice was ayahuasca, which in> itself is a miracle of science. Ayahuasca is a brew prepared from the> Banisteriopsis vine—also known as the spirit vine—and is usually mixed with> leaves of shrubs that contain dimethyltryptamine. Depending on the> availability of the species of plants, the ingredients vary locally throughout> South America. The potion is then brewed for more than 24 hours before it is> drunk. If it is taken in any other way, the potion will have no effect at all.> Ayahuasca is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it creates an inhibitor that> temporarily (typically for a period of half an hour) stops the creation of> certain chemicals in the brain, which creates what skeptics call a> hallucination, but that is incorrect: Experiencers describe it as the entry> into another dimension, where communication with an otherworldly intelligence> occurs. The shamans say that ayahuasca itself is a gift of the gods, and Narby> has underlined that it is simply impossible for someone to have accidentally> stumbled upon how to make ayahuasca: It uses specific plants, which have to be> brewed for more than a day. In short, someone told the shamans how to concoct> this alchemical potion. Ayahuasca should therefore be described as> technology—chemical in nature—that aids humankind in establishing contact with> an alien intelligence.> Narby wrote a book titled The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of> Knowledge, in which he concluded that the shamanic experience induced through> ayahuasca connected with an intelligence, and that this intelligence resided> within our own DNA. The “Cosmic Serpent”—a name often given by the shamans to> the intelligence they connect to—was in fact the double helix structure of> DNA. In short, Narby stipulates that the means to contact the alien> intelligence is through DNA, which, as we have as seen, is alien in origin> itself.> A third explorer of Amazonian shamanism is anthropologist Michael Harner. In> his studies, after he drank the ayahuasca potion, he described how “I met> bird-headed people, as well as dragon-like creatures who explained that they> were the true gods of this world.... I realized that anthropologists,> including myself, had profoundly underestimated the importance of the drug in> affecting native ideology.”7> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos616607] Is it indeed just a> coincidence that the ancient Egyptians depicted their deities as bird-headed> people? Or have we come to the core of the problem—and the answer, which is> that these otherworldly denizens were indeed seen as the Egyptian deities and> that it was these otherworldly intelligences that provided the extraordinary> knowledge that went into the Egyptian monuments?> One vision Harner had in 1961, which he recorded in The Way of the Shaman, is> of great interest to the Ancient Alien Question. He was shown “planet Earth as> it was eons ago, before there was any life on it. I saw an ocean, barren land,> and a bright blue sky. Then black specks dropped from the sky by the hundreds> and landed in front of me on the barren landscape. I could see the ‘specks’> were actually large, shiny, black creatures with stubby pterodactyl-like wings> and huge whale-like bodies.” The good bit is yet to come: “They explained to> me in a kind of thought language that they were fleeing from something out in> space. They had come to the planet Earth to escape their enemy. The creatures> then showed me how they had created life on the planet in order to hide within> the multitudinous forms and thus disguise their presence. Before me, the> magnificence of plant and animal creation and speciation—hundreds of millions> of years of activity—took place on a scale and with a vividness impossible to> describe. I learned that the dragon-like creatures were thus inside all forms> of life, including man.”> In a footnote, Harner notes that this intelligence was “almost like DNA,” but> added that in 1963, he hardly knew anything about DNA. It would be more than> three decades later that Narby realized that the intelligence was indeed> present inside DNA. DNA is the single common denominator of all life on planet> Earth. Narby highlights that Harner’s observation actually coincides with the> theory of panspermia: that DNA was of extraterrestrial origin and was somehow> “seeded” on our planet. This is precisely the “vision” Harner was given in the> depths of the Amazonian jungle, but it is also the conclusion reached by the> most enterprising scientists in Western laboratories.> In The Cosmic Serpent, Narby explores the various ancient accounts and> highlights what he sees as clear evidence that the double DNA helix was known> to our ancestors as the other-dimensional intelligence that communicated with> humankind. He identifies the ladder, which was said to connect heaven and> earth in so many traditions as another non-scientific description of the> double helix, stating, “In Australia, Tibet, Nepal, Ancient Egypt, Africa, and> North and South America, the symbolism of the rope, like that of the ladder,> necessarily implies communication between sky and earth. It is by means of a> rope or a ladder... that the gods descend to earth and men go up to the sky.”> Quetzalcoatl was seen by the Mexicans not only as their civilizing deity, but> also as the deity enabling contact with God himself—the creator deity. Coatl> in Aztec means both “serpent” and “twin”; the structure of DNA is very much> serpentine and definitely twin-like, and thus Narby believes that the Cosmic> Serpent—whether it is named Quetzalcoatl or differently—is indeed the enabler> that connects with the gods. It is technology. It is DNA. Narby writes, “DNA> is only 10 atoms wide and as such constitutes a sort of ultimate technology:> It is organic and so miniaturized that it approaches the limits of material> existence.”8 [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos616726] It is> precisely the type of technology that conforms to the specifications of a von> Neumann probe. Narby believes that DNA is technology, which is able to contain> an intelligence that is now terrestrial, though at the same time> other-dimensional, and once extraterrestrial. It was responsible for life on> Earth, and was recognized by our ancestors as such.

This area includes Native American tribes like the> Navajo and the Hopi.> The Ancestral Puebloans were the first North Americans to use looms to weave> cotton and to make blankets, and they even used socks made from yucca leaves,> interwoven with turkey feathers, to make sandals. At the same time, and for no> obvious reason, they also deliberately flattened and broadened their skulls by> binding the heads of babies against cradleboards. For some, this is suggestive> evidence that they were trying to make their children resemble the people who> brought them their civilization: “gods.”> The story of the Ancestral Puebloans lives on in the mythology of the Hopi,> considered by many to be the most mysterious and mystical of all Native> American tribes. It begins with the claim that their ancestors emerged from> the Third World through a crack, into our Fourth World, in a place known as> the Sipapu, which they locate near Desert View, 25 miles east of Grand Canyon> Village, near the confluence of the Colorado and the Little Colorado rivers.> Reaching it requires a seven-hour trek along the Salt Trail Canyon. The Sipapu> itself is a natural salt dome, 20 to 26 feet high, topped by a permanent> spring—a mineral hot spring, though some wonder whether it is a geyser. It is> their Hill of Creation, though the Hopi label it a Place of Emergence.> At the beginning of the Fourth World, the Hopi were greeted by Maasaw, the> caretaker deity of the land—their civilizing deity. He had also been appointed> the head of the Third World, but had become a little self-important and lost> his humility, and other deities had therefore made him the deity of death and> the underworld. But Maasaw was given a second chance in the Fourth World. He> ordered the survivors to separate out into clans and begin a series of> migrations across the continent, on which the stars would guide them.> Eventually, they would meet again and settle. Maasaw gave each clan one or> more sacred tablets, which would guide them along their migrations. To each> clan, he also gave a small water jar, which was magical, and came with> instructions that included a description on how to make a new water jar, in> case the old one was broken or needed to be replaced. The Hopi argue that this> water jar is the missing component in making sense of the locations chosen by> the Ancestral Puebloans to live: The water jar meant that they could settle> miles away from rivers, as it allowed them to create springs and rivers> wherever they settled. Once they abandoned their dwellings and continued their> migration, they took the jar with them, rendering the site once again as dry> as a bone. Thus, when archaeologists say the Ancestral Puebloans vacated their> settlements because of drought, they might be missing the key element of the> story. If the story of the water jar is true, it is definitely yet another> sign of highly advanced technology.> The notion that these clans were on a divine migration also explains why> several settlements were so often abandoned after a century, or even less, of> occupation. The archaeological consensus that the cliff dwellings that typify> the Ancestral Puebloans were abandoned because of drought might therefore be a> complete fallacy, underlining the point once again that archaeology, without> the active participation of anthropology and the myths and legends of our> ancestors, is dry at best, and wrong most often.> Finally, the Hopi claim that each clan was supposed to complete four> migrations, but that only a minority of the clans actually did—specifically> those that kept the “door on top of their heads” (the real stargate) open and> realized the purpose and meaning behind the four migrations, which was that> they were purification ceremonies. Once the ceremonies were completed, these> clans would return to the sacred circle, to establish the Hopi Mesas, their> permanent settlement—until the advent of the Fifth World, which the Maya, with> whom the Hopi are known to have interacted, place at AD December 21, 2012.> These Hopi Mesas are three mesas, relatively near each other, roughly> northeast of Flagstaff and southwest of Chinle in Arizona. They are quite> literally in the middle of nowhere, while the entire Hopi Reservation itself> is surrounded on all sides by the Navajo/Apache Indians. One of the reasons> why the Hopi are such outsiders even within the Native American community is> that they never signed any peace treaty, and thus seem to have missed out on> certain benefits other Native Americans were able to receive from the U.S.> government.> The Hopi Mesas, three settlements in a somewhat mountainous environment, are> the homeland of the Hopi, the divine destination of the wandering tribes of> the Ancestral Puebloans. The real Center of the World—their navel—is> Tuuwanasavi, a few miles from the village of Oraibi, the Third Mesa.

They walked out> of an earthwork near the village. They had green skin, wore unusual clothing,> and spoke a language no one could comprehend. After days of refusing all types> of food, the only food they would eat was green beans. The boy soon died, but> the girl began to lose her green skin color, while she also began to diversify> her food. When she was proficient enough in English, she explained that she> came from another world—a land where the sun never shone and the light was> like twilight.> The incident was reported by two contemporary writers, Ralph of Coggeshall> (died circa 1226) and William of Newburgh (circa 1136–1198). William’s account> was written in 1189, and Ralph’s account, written in the 1220s, incorporated> information from Richard de Calne of Wykes, who reportedly gave the children> refuge in his manor 6 miles north of Woolpit. He was also responsible for the> education of the sister, who eventually married a man from King’s Lynn, about> 40 miles from Woolpit, where Ralph said she was living shortly before he wrote> his account. Based on his research into Richard de Calne’s family history,> British astronomer Duncan Lunan has concluded that the girl was named Agnes> and that she married a royal official named Richard Barre.> In 1621, Robert Burton, in The Anatomy of Melancholy, suggested that the green> children may have fallen “from Heaven.” In short, they might be> extraterrestrials. Others confronted with the story of the Green Children> agree that there is clearly some type of mystery going on, but argue that> rather than an extraterrestrial component, they came instead from the faery> realm. They refer to Gerald of Wales, who told a similar story of a boy who> encountered two pigmies who led him through an underground passage into a> beautiful land with fields and rivers, but which was not lit by the full light> of the sun. However, cataloguers of folk stories have said that the story of> the Woolpit children is the only example of its type—it is, in short, unique.> Dozens of people have tried to explain this story away, opting for a purely> symbolic interpretation, for we all know that such a story cannot be true,> right? However, it is precisely because it did happen that it was reported in> the chronicles; the contemporary historians considered it to be so> extraordinary!> Just before he died, in 212 BC, Emperor Chi Huang Ti ordered that all the> books and literature relating to ancient China be destroyed. Similarly,> according to Carl Sagan, there was once a book titled The True History of> Mankind Over the Last 100,000 Years in the famed library of Alexandria, but> the document was burned in a series of deliberate acts of arson meant to> eradicate the “pagan” knowledge contained in those buildings in the third> century AD. When the Spanish Conquistadors conquered the Aztecs in the 16th> century, they burnt all the Aztecs’ books. Then, in the middle of the 19th> century when the first European settler, a French priest named Eugene Eyraud,> arrived on Easter Island, he made it his mission to burn as many of the native> rongo rongo tablets as he could. Is it any wonder that “science” can’t find> any evidence for ancient aliens, or lost knowledge?> That the evidence for the Ancient Alien Question has to be found in the most> gigantic monuments—which were simply too big and solid to be destroyed—and> ancient legends is precisely because of the consistent trend throughout> humankind’s most recent history, on all continents, to eradicate large> amounts, if not the majority, of our history—of “what came before.” Though we> no longer believe the world originated in 4004 BC, what science and> archaeology have done is to place the origins of civilization at that moment> in time, and argue that anything before then cannot be validated by science,> and hence by default is believed not to be true. However, truth simply is,> whether you believe it or not.> Is there any object or written document that proves that ancient aliens> visited planet Earth? No. But, as I have shown throughout this book, ancient> buildings reveal that they were constructed with massive stones that could not> have been moved without some form of advanced technology or knowledge—not> necessarily through more gigantic cranes than are currently in use in modern> building projects, but more likely via a form of knowledge and understanding> of the laws of the universe. As a body of literature, the ancient myths and> legends clearly state that gods were once present on Earth and gave the gift> of civilization and various other knowledge to humankind. This is evidence.> Were these ancient aliens physically present on planet Earth? Maybe. Legends> such as that of Oannes clearly speak of a nonhuman, physical intelligence that> came out of the sea and educated humankind in the ways of civilization. But> there are other legends that make it clear that the gods were not necessarily> physically here, and may not even be physical as such; they could best be> described as a nonhuman, otherworldly intelligence that we can contact through> a number of means, many of which today would be classified under the label of> paranormal, parapsychological, or—a term I prefer—metaphysical. Alas, the> metaphysical realm has also been fenced off and deemed to be off-limits for> scientific exploration, so finding more evidence in support of the Ancient> Alien Question from that field can only come from personal accounts, such as> what happened with The Nine in the investigations carried out by Andrija> Puharich. And though it is not yet the consensus, what science has> discovered—to its own horror, it seems—is that life itself is extraterrestrial> in nature.> British astronomer Duncan Lunan has pondered the question of contact and> communication with other intelligences for many decades. It is his conviction> that, based on the number of stars and planets in the universe, an> extraterrestrial civilization should have contacted us at least once,> and—statistically speaking—a maximum of four times. This means that out of all> the evidence that suggests we have been contacted, based upon what science> currently knows, or rather, thinks, about life in the universe, statistically> speaking, contact is a very rare thing. It means that out of the 230 questions> posed by Erich von Däniken, out of all the evidence we have gone through in> this book, only one to four of them should eventually be answered in the> positive. In Man and the Stars, Duncan Lunan put forward 22 items of best> evidence, which includes the story of Oannes, the ancient maps, the Chinese> Roswell, the pyramids, Baalbek, the Watchers, Viracocha, Ezekiel, and many> more. Some are clear evidence of contact with a nonhuman intelligence, whereas> others are at least clear evidence of technology and knowledge possessed by> our ancestors that exceeds our traditional historical understanding of these> cultures.> What this book has hopefully demonstrated is that the manner in which science> has tried to look toward these enigmas is not the correct, or at least not the> only, approach. When we look at reality the way it is, rather than within the> reduced framework in which science prefers to operate, it becomes clear that> there is only one answer.> Were We Alone? No.> There are hundreds if not thousands of examples that show this throughout> humankind’s history. The gift of civilization was said to have been granted to> us by the gods, but there is other evidence that shows we have never been> alone. Modern UFO research is but the latest incarnation of a long tradition> that argues for the presence of a nonhuman intelligence. Alas, in the> materialistic mindset that continues to dominate our era, the notion has> always been that this should be a physical extraterrestrial presence here on> Earth. This is not necessarily so, and the work of Jeremy Narby and the> accounts of hundreds of shamans in the Amazonian jungle make it apparent that> people can access a realm where they can interface with this nonhuman> intelligence, and that these “gods” give them highly technological> information—the most famous of which is the chemical process of making> ayahuasca, the potion that enables communication with the gods.> When molecular biologist Dr. Pia Malnoe was taken into the Amazon by Narby,> she concluded that “The way shamans get their knowledge is not very different> from the way scientists get their knowledge. It has the same origin, but> shamans and scientists use different methods.”1> [The_Ancient_Alien_Question_split_017.html#filepos617052]> In my opinion, most Ancient Alien Theories have failed in finding proof> because their scope was too limited, and the answer they were after was> erroneous. Though in a number of rare instances the gods were likely here in> physical form, they definitely did not come to planet Earth to exploit its> minerals or enslave Homo sapiens for that purpose. I would argue that, apart> from Oannes, an accidental crash like “the Chinese Roswell” at> Baian-Kara-Ulla, and one or two other similar incidents, such physical contact> was probably sporadic at best. But when we really look at our history, it is> clear that civilization was indeed guided by gods, by a nonhuman,> extraterrestrial intelligence. Though today we would consider this to be the> bailiwick of religion, it is not; it is about directly experiencing another> reality and contacting this intelligence. The work of McKenna, Narby, Harner,> and so many others has made it clear that this is real. The technology and> information they have given us ranges from insights into DNA (as per Jeremy> Narby), the enigmatic mathematical formula of time that Terence McKenna> received, and maybe the chemical methodology to create geopolymers, given to> the Egyptian priest Imhotep.> What is evidence? What is proof? There are clear parallels between what> McKenna and Imhotep received. There are hundreds of passages in the sacred> literature of every ancient civilization that speak of contact with nonhuman> intelligences. In the case of Oannes, even the likes of Carl Sagan felt that> the evidence was in—that this could only be explained as contact with a> physical extraterrestrial entity. For some, these accounts will not be enough.> But we have also learned the answer goes far beyond a simple yes. In fact,> life is a cosmic imperative. We are the aliens. Chandra Wickramasinghe in> Cosmic Dragons writes, “Life is a truly cosmic phenomenon, the sum total of an> evolutionary experience gained and accumulated in a multitude of different> places, quite widely separated, and extending in time throughout the entire> history of the Universe.” Wickramasinghe is convinced that there is a slow but> definitive move within the scientific community to accept the extraterrestrial> origins of life, describing it as “a major paradigm shift comparable in> importance to the Copernican revolution of the 16th century.” When that> happens, the next challenge science will have to address is the Ancient Alien> Question—a question it has consistently shied away from.> The key here is the consensus reality: what we all agree to believe. It is a> basic human right that any individual has the freedom to believe what he or> she wants. And so it is my hope—my wish—that in these pages, I have laid out> the nature and complexity of the Ancient Alien Question in such a way that you> have the necessary building blocks that will allow you to decide whether you> believe. I have shown you the process as to why I believe the answer is yes.> But what I know is that the Ancient Alien Question has to be asked again> today, for there are millions of people out there who want an answer."},{"pageContent":"NotesForeword> 1.

career began at the age of 23, when he edited the> late Belgian historian Marcel Mestdagh’s research into European megaliths for> a much-anticipated sequel. That same year, he also helped edit a controversial> nonfiction thriller on the theft of Jan Van Eyck’s altarpiece, The Adoration> of the Lamb, which was made into a documentary both for Flemish television and> the BBC.> If there is one thing that sets Coppens apart from other writers, it is that> he is often ahead of the trends. He wrote the first guide on Rosslyn Chapel in> more than four decades; he was the only one to do so before The Da Vinci Code> made that Scottish chapel world-famous in 2003.

Two> years later, he broke the story of the existence of Chinese pyramids to an> international audience. Many stories from the so-called esoteric field have at> one point passed through his hands, including The Templar Revelation, the book> on which The Da Vinci Code was based. In 1999, Coppens was the principal> researcher for Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince’s The Stargate Conspiracy, which> investigated current politicians’ apparent obsession with ancient Egypt, thus> combining his passion for politics and history.> Coppens is the author of The Stone Puzzle of Rosslyn Chapel (2002), about the> enigmatic Scottish chapel and its relationship with freemasonry and the> Knights Templar; The Canopus Revelation (2004), about the lore of the star> Canopus in ancient cultures; Land of the Gods (2007), about the prehistory of> Southern Scotland and the myth of King Arthur; The New Pyramid Age (2007),> detailing the most recent discoveries that have changed our understanding of> pyramids; and Servants of the Grail (2009), identifying the real people> encoded into the medieval Grail legends.
