In text and image, I want to documentthat among the Maya and Aztec not everything is, by a long shot, what we havebeen taught—another way of looking yields a new result.The chaos had already begun with Christopher Columbus. On October 12, 1492, hisson wrote in his diary: “We noticed two or three settlements, and the nativepeople called to us and thanked God. Some brought water, others broughtsomething to eat. . . . They asked us if we came from heaven.”1[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn1]The bewildered and utterly baffled natives did not suspect what actually hadoccurred. Soon after the first encounter, coffee-brown, stark-naked natives ranfrom all heavenly directions to the landing site and were part of anincomprehensible ceremony. Columbus, as well as the captains and officers of theaccompanying ships Pinta and Nina, wore ostentatious garments: dark-brown anddark-red velvet costumes with white Flemish ruffs; Turkish trousers and wide,silver-studded belts; violet silk stockings; and on top of it all, the coats ofthe Spanish court cavalry. Columbus himself, as has been documented, wore a widehat from which gold coins jingled. In one hand he carried his rapier and theroyal flag in the other. The escorting officers waved flags. Next, two beardedmonks in brown cowls tramped over the planking, with a cross on their shoulders.Finally, another part of the ship’s crew was added, coarse swashbucklers inmulticolored clothes. Then bald-headed men staggered ashore, but the Indianswere not familiar with bald people. Some had shoes, others were barefoot, andsome of the foul-smelling mates wore brightly colored shirts. Still others,despite the humid heat, wore iron helmets. And naturally they carried theirknives, rapiers, and shotguns—verily, they made a scintillating and estimablebunch.Looking back, it’s amazing that, confronted with this otherworldly theatertroupe, the native inhabitants did not run away as if from the devil.Columbus and his officers generously gave out gifts: cheap red caps, worthlessglass pearls, kitschy small mirrors, and some hair combs. The natives reverentlynamed these trifles turey. That means “heaven.”A convincing example of magic, with which Columbus fooled the natives, occurredon December 26, 1492. Columbus demonstrated his “godly” power: “I fired abombard [heavy piece of artillery] and a shotgun. As the Indians heard the crashand saw the muzzle flash, they threw themselves on the ground. It took a longtime until they dared to move again.”2 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn2]Almost thirty years later, in 1519, this inglorious play was repeated in adramatic fashion. Hernando Cortez turned up off the coast of Mexico with elevenships, 100 sailors, and 508 soldiers. Cortez wanted to command respect and let acannonball fly over the heads of the Indians. He noted that the natives fell tothe ground as if they were dead, and they lay terrified for a while.Francisco Pizarro was at first classified as a god by the Incas in SouthAmerica.3 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn3] And the British Captain Cook, whodiscovered the South Sea Islands, had the same experience: the nativesconsidered him the returned god Rongo, or Longo4 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn4](figure 1 [9781591432364_fm1.xhtml#fig1]).A little pageantry, a little noise, a little superior technology, and anyhillbilly would cower in fear.Today we would say that the indigenous tribes were overwhelmed. They did notknow the technologies of the conquerors. They could not classify the foreignbeings, uniforms, and weapons. And so the conquerors grew into gods in theimagination of the natives. We all know these were no gods and they never were.The term “gods” resulted from a misunderstanding.All this happened centuries ago, and something like that could not happen again.Really?An example familiar from Christianity verifies our distorted view: Everyonecertainly knows that Jesus of Nazareth preached in Palestine 2,000 years ago andwas finally executed by the Romans. For this, there is the written testimony ofthe Gospels and letters of the apostles. Christianity spread to many corners ofthe world; a hundred thousand chapels, churches, and wonderful cathedrals werebuilt. In them one can find altars with grandiose oil paintings, Christianartwork made of gold and silver, statues of the Virgin Mary, and crucifixionscenes. A Christian culture was created with its own music, such as Gregorianchants or the orchestral masses of Johann Sebastian Bach.Have you ever thought that of all those artists and composers who placed theircreativity in the service of religion none were eyewitnesses to the actualevents? No architects of any cathedral or church, no masons of stone altars, nocrib carver of Oberammergau observed the birth and the life of Jesus with hisown eyes. Neither Michelangelo nor Bach was present for the Last Supper, and noartisans of the past 2,000 years heard the Sermon on the Mount “live.” All ofthem—without exception—became tools of tradition.Jesus himself didn’t leave behind a single object that could be admired in anymuseum in the world. He didn’t scribble on a single scrap of parchment, presshis godly feet in clay, or leave behind his autograph with the actual date ofthe Roman calendar.Suppose, in a thousand years, archaeologists were to dig up the remains ofChristian churches. With very precise dating they would say that over a periodof at least 2,000 years the same motifs were used again and again. They wouldconsistently find crucifixion scenes, manger birth, angels, and apostles withhalos on their venerable heads. Naturally, specialist scholars of the futurewould find contradictions. A Mother of Christ figure from Bavaria will not lookthe same as a Mother of Christ figure from Kenya. The cathedral of Chartres inFrance, with its unparalleled beautiful glass windows and its grandiosearchitecture, is not comparable with the simple concrete churches of 2010. Theartists and architects all meant the same thing, but they expressed it indifferent ways. And something else: due to the discoveries, archaeologists wouldarrive at the opinion that Jesus of Nazareth changed the earth approximately2,000 years ago, because the cultural monuments can be dated back to 2,000 yearsago.Those who are Christians know how all of this came about. Will people know thisin 1,000 years? How little people know and how quickly misunderstandings arisecan be proven from the Age of Discovery. That is exactly what this book is allabout. To see the old images in a new light, I must first—willingly orreluctantly—explain for the umpteenth time what ethnologists understand by theterm “cargo cult.” Without this explanation, some readers will not be able tofollow my thinking.Yours,Erich von DänikenJuly, 2011"},{"pageContent":"image [images/img_002.jpg]Figure 2image [images/img_003.jpg]Figure 3"},{"pageContent":"1Cargo Cults with ConsequencesIn the spring of 1945 the Americans built a base camp in the area of Hollandiain New Guinea. At times as many as 40,000 soldiers were stationed there.Airplanes landed and took off nonstop in order to bring supplies for the War ofthe Pacific. The bush residents, mostly Papuans, observed uncomprehendingly thehustle and bustle of the foreigners. They understood neither world politics nortechnology. Now, American soldiers handed out small gifts, such as chocolate,chewing gum, old shoes, or an empty bottle. Soon, the natives described all ofthese gifts with the word “cargo,” a word they had heard from the foreigners. Anincreasing number of natives ventured out of the bush and to the edges of theairstrip. There, they observed how large silver birds making loud noises roseinto the clouds. Possibly to heaven. The natives wished that these heavenlybirds would fly directly to their tribal area and there unload their “cargo.”What was to be done?1 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn5]The Papuans believed that they should behave just like the foreigners. So onWewak Island there was a full makeshift airport with imitation runways andairplanes made of wood and straw (figures 2 and 3). In the eastern highlands ofNew Guinea, Dutch officers found “radio stations” and “insulators” made out ofleaves rolled together (figures 4 and 5). Imitation watches were made out ofwood and iron, and imitation steel helmets were made out of tortoise shells.Dutch and American officers observed this tomfoolery, were stunned, and oftenlaughed about it. “With an unbelievable seriousness, the natives bravelyimitated everything they observed.”2 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn6]image [images/img_004.jpg]Figure 4image [images/img_005.jpg]Figure 5image [images/img_006.jpg]Figure 6There is also the experience of the German aircraft researcher Hans Bertram whenhe had to make an emergency landing in Australia. He was not killed by theAborigines only because he wore aviator goggles. They only knew goggle-likeobjects from their rock drawings. There, however, those drawings represented thegoddess Wandina (figure 6).As Frank Hurley arrived in the Kaimari village in New Guinea in the 1920s, thenatives saw his water plane as a divine bird. Every night, they rowed in a canoeto the bow of the airplane and offered a pig there (figure 7).3[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn7] In ethnology all of these misunderstandings aredescribed with the little term “cargo cult.” The starting point for a cargo cultis always the collision of two different cultures. One culture istechnologically less developed than the other and does not understand thetechnology of the more-developed society (figure 8). All contact between nativesand those with superior technologies played out in the same way:image [images/img_007.jpg]Figure 7 1. The carriers of the superior technologies were seen as “supernatural.” 2. The error was soon discovered, and the “supernatural” are brought back into the realm of humans. 3. After meeting the foreigners, others were in turn branded as “supernatural gods.” Their return was generally awaited.Today, we can only chuckle at the reaction of the natives. We think we knowbetter. Indeed, a technologically more advanced culture—such as anextraterrestrial one—would also be assessed by us as supernatural. We wouldunderstand their weapons and communication systems as little as the nativesunderstood Columbus and his theater troupe. We would classify technology that isa generation ahead of ours as “magical.” Not unlike then. Exactly suchmisunderstandings are what I want to uncover in this book and expose these cargocults that we have hitherto attributed to holy goings-on and about whichcorrespondingly profound treatises on religious psychology have been written. Iquestion these seemingly sure assessments—but without the insistence of beingright.image [images/img_008.jpg]Figure 8image [images/img_009.jpg]Figure 9The ruins of Tikal lie in current-day Guatemala; its beginnings go back toapproximately 1000 BCE. (Remember that ancient Rome was supposedly founded in753 BCE.) In the center zone of Tikal alone, three thousand buildings arelocated: houses, palaces, administration buildings, terraces, platforms,pyramids, and altars. What was the purpose of the pyramids? Were theyobservatories? Why were so many of them crowded so closely together (figures 9and 10).Were they graves? To this day, no tombs have been found under the pyramids.image [images/img_010.jpg]Figure 10image [images/img_011.jpg]Figure 11Were the pyramids schools for different ways of thinking? Where would theteachers have taught and the students learned? There is very little room on apyramid platform (figures 11 and 12).Were the pyramids sacrificial sites? Not in Tikal, as human sacrifices were notoffered until later.Or were the pyramids possibly memorials of the ruling families? But that doesn’tmake sense, because different pyramids were erected at the same time. The rulerswould have prevented this.image [images/img_012.jpg]Figure 12The region under the administration of the Guatemalan government as a nationalarchaeological park consists of an area encompassing 576 square kilometers (222sq. mi.). This giant area was once the space for a collection of tremendousbuildings—currently overgrown by the jungle (figures 13 and 14). Moreover, Tikallies in an impossible location: there is practically no water. Rulers alwayssought a site with water for their people. Literally nothing for humans workswithout water. But in Tikal there was neither creek nor river. The nearestwater—Lake Petén Itzá—is 40 kilometers (25 mi.) away. So the Maya dugkilometer-long canals, creating massive water-storage capacity in Tikal, withseven canals located in the inner zone and three in the outer. Radar images havebrought to the fore the veins of the irrigation system, which expanded over theentire Yucatán Peninsula.image [images/img_013.jpg]Figure 13image [images/img_014.jpg]Figure 14But why did people erect impressive buildings (figures 15 to 17), made up ofmillions of stones, in a place without water? This indispensible water must havebeen available at the groundbreaking. Who carved the stones, carried the stones,piled the stones on top of each other, brought water? The architects in Tikalplanned well, because the site was 40 kilometers away from Lake Petén Itzá. Whyin the world did it have to be located in this impossible location? What wouldhave been the compelling reason for this?image [images/img_015.jpg]Figure 15image [images/img_016.jpg]Figure 16image [images/img_017.jpg]Figure 17The same phenomenon also exists in our time. Pilgrimage sites such as Lourdes insouthern France, Fátima in Portugal, or Guadalupe in Mexico were created for asingle reason: something supernatural occurred there. In Lourdes a girl namedBernadette Soubirous claims far and wide that she saw the Virgin Mother in somerocks (figure 18). In Fátima there were three children who for months saw awhite lady in a treetop at the same time on the same day of the month (figure19). The vision spoke to the children. It was the same in Mexico. There the“Queen of Heaven” came to a young Indian. The ground became sacred. Anincreasing number of people flocked to the sites of these visions. At first afew candles and some flowers were placed at the sites, and soon there was achapel, then a church, and finally a cathedral. Hotdog vendors and taverns setup shop, the first hotels were opened. Lourdes, Fátima, Guadalupe, and othersites became places of pilgrimage for many. In Guadalupe, the believersworshipped a shawl—called a tilma. The shawl, framed today, hangs over an altarof the basilica. It supposedly made itself in a supernatural way and shows awoman surrounded by an aureole and wearing a cloak of stars (figure 20). Theentire infrastructure of all pilgrimage sites—streets, electricity,plumbing—grew simultaneously with the influx of pilgrims. But the starting pointfor this tremendous expense was always something supernatural. Here—and onlyhere!—something supernatural occurred.image [images/img_018.jpg]Figure 18image [images/img_019.jpg]Figure 19image [images/img_020.jpg]Figure 20Was this also the case for Tikal?There, archaeologists found small jade plates, containing fifteen Mayan symbolsthat have been deciphered. “The ruler of the heavenly family descended here.”With all due respect: which heavenly family? Did the ancestors of the Maya, inthis geographical place—and only there!—experience something supernatural?Something so influential that the ground became a place of pilgrimage? Did thedescendants of the prehistoric Maya wait for the return of some “rulers of theheavenly family”?One of the steles of Tikal is called a “pre-classical stele,” and its date oforigin has been disputed. Today it is in a small museum near the ruins of Tikal.The head of the stele has been cut off, but one can recognize the chest, twobent elbows, decorated forearms, and both hands clearly have mitten-like gloves(figure 21). Below, experts recognize a horizontal crest with a double snakehead. In the middle follows the spinal cord, then—still lower—a wide belt,thighs, and finally the feet. Scholars recognized a loincloth covered with jadebeads and sandals on the feet. The arms seem to hold a form of a ceremonialstaff, which ends in small snake heads. Hand on the heart: How objective is thisobservation? Wide bands lie around the wrists, and the mittens can be recognizedeven by a blind person (figure 22). In order to highlight the technicalparticulars, I have colored the image a bit (figure 23). The supposed “spinalcord” could be a bent tube that empties into a small box. A “spinal cord” mustrun perpendicular to the coccyx. In fact, the feet are in boots, and out of eachboot winds a curious hose. The Maya themselves were barefoot or wore sandals.What were the boots with the hoses? Was the “ruler of the heavenly family” shownhere? Are bracelets, mittens, spinal cord, small boxes, boots, and hoses notjust other misunderstandings of technology? Had the artist carved something instone out of holy respect, which he himself did not understand?image [images/img_021.jpg]Figure 21image [images/img_022.jpg]Figure 22The question would be absurd if it weren’t for countless related representationsfrom the world of the Maya at which to marvel. In Guatemala, not far from thePacific coast, is the small village of El Baúl. I found the village’s mainattraction in an open, wind- and weather-beaten wooden shed near a sugarfactory. The “El-Baúl Monument No. 27,” as the stele is officially known, is2.54 meters (8.3 ft.) tall and 1.47 meters (4.8 ft.) wide (figure 24). Decadesago it was discovered by chance in a forest clearing and left here. The steleshows a dominating figure with arms bent and hands resting on hips. The handsseem to be protected by boxing gloves, and in each hand is a tennis-ball-sizeball. Thoroughly modern, the feet of the figure are in boots that reach to theknees and cover knickerbocker-like pants. A wide belt separates the pants fromthe close-fitting top. So far—though remarkable—this figure was dressed in thefashion of his time. But the helmet, which covers the entire head, isperplexing. Like a diving outfit, it has large coils on the shoulders (figure25). From the helmet a tube extends to a box, similar to a tank, on the back.When observed more closely, one recognizes a spyhole in the helmet, and behindit, the nasal catheter and the left eye of the helmet wearer (figure 26).image [images/img_023.jpg]Figure 23image [images/img_024.jpg]Figure 24image [images/img_025.jpg]Figure 25It gets stranger: In a direct extension of the nose, but outside of the helmet,the stonemason fashioned an animal nose, maybe that of a jaguar. Out of thesnarling jaw blows—as if squeezed out—the breath of the helmet wearer. Thefigure wears two bands around its neck. One ends in a small square box on thechest, the other in a round something, possibly an amulet. On the foot of thestele, six goblins are sitting in the lotus position, and all are helmeted with“head horns” over the ears (figure 27). On the ground in front of the mainfigure lies a person with mitten-like gloves. He also has a ball that he givesto the helmet wearer.image [images/img_026.jpg]Figure 26According to experts, the relic represents a scene from the deadly ball game ofthe Maya. The winner wore the mask of a monkey, jaguar, or possibly also anopossum. Therefore the “hose” from the helmet to the tank is nothing other thanthe tail of a small opossum, and the expressed air symbolizes water, since theopossum is a water animal.This is an academic explanation—though ultimately as imaginative as myinterpretation. Why would a ballplayer put on the mask of an animal since itwould only hinder him? The Maya were masters of an extremely fast game. Theplayers had to react with lightning speed, their eyes had to see everything. Theface behind the mask would have only a very limited view. And why should theplayer hang the tail of an opossum behind his oversized ear? What is the tank onhis back? For comparison: The ballplayers of Chichén Itzá (Mexico) wore neitheranimal masks nor possum tails behind their ears, let alone vessels on theirback.image [images/img_027.jpg]Figure 27image [images/img_028.jpg]Figure 28I am spelling out another reading from the “cargo cult school”: For a long timethe predecessors of the Maya thought that “god” = extraterrestrial. He wore aclosed helmet with a viewing window. This is because of the composition of theearth’s air and bacteria. From one tank on the back, a chemical mixture flowedout that enriched or disinfected our air. The consumed air was expelled again.The entire body stays in a tight, air-permeable jumpsuit, finished with highboots. Just as in the example of Christian churches, the stonemason of “MonumentNo. 27” from El Baúl never came face to face with “god.” That meeting lay far,far in the past. The detailed work of the artist originated from the fantasy ofcustom, similar to current artists who paint the Ascension of Jesus over a sidealtar, although they were not present for the actual event.In addition, the stele from El Baúl is not the only one that shows a tank on theback. Decades ago, a strange figure came before my camera in Copán (Honduras).The stone was also worn by wind and weather over the centuries. In the end,though, a “tank” is clearly visible on the back, and on it is a type of gearwheel (figure 28). A hose goes directly from it into the helmet of the figure.Copán is located 270 air kilometers (168 mi.) away from Tikal in present-dayHonduras. In 1576, Spanish annalist Diego Garcia de Palacio had this to sayabout it:Here are the ruins of beautiful temples that demonstrate that a large city stoodhere, from which one cannot assume that such primitive people, assumed to be theprevious residents, would have even been able to build them. . . . In betweenthese ruins are highly remarkable things. Before you get there, you willencounter very thick walls and a giant, stone eagle. He wears a square on hischest, whose sides are of such a length that amount to a quarter of a Spanishcubit on which recognizable characters are drawn. If you step closer, you willdiscover the shape of a large, stone giant; the Indians said that he was theguardian of the shrine.4 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn8]image [images/img_029.jpg]Figure 29Absolutely nothing remains of the “giant, stone eagle.” Copán, the mostimportant point of interest in Honduras, was named by experts the “Alexandria ofthe New World,” Sylvanus Griswold Morley (1883–1948), the renowned American Mayaresearcher, maintained that Copán was the city “in which astronomy reached itshighest development. It is the center of Maya science.”5[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn9]The ruins, which were fully overgrown by the forest, were rediscovered in 1839.Approximately one hundred years later, the excavations began (figure 29). Thecenter of Copán, with its palaces and pyramids, temples and terraces, lieshigher than the wider city and is called the acropolis. Almost exactly in themiddle lies the playing field with a ball court that is 26 meters long (85 ft.)and 7 meters (23 ft.) wide (figure 30). The absolute sensation is thesixty-three-step hieroglyphic stairway, which was once part of a larger temple.The list of kings is chiseled into it. Appropriately enough, all of thishappened because of a ruler named Butz’ Yip, a name roughly translated as “smokeis his power.” On the stairs one can see carvings of sitting groups of peopleand some date marks. There are approximately 2,200 total Mayan glyphs—the oldestknown Mayan inscriptions (figure 31). Sixteen stone priest-astronomers giveadvice about the complicated Mayan calendar. Here in Copán, experts discoveredthe digits for the beginning of this calendar, the composite number with theinput glyph “4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.” It is the date on which the calendar calculationbegins, which today is translated as August 14, 3114 BCE. It is curious that atthat time, there were no Maya. Either they took over the starting point of thecalendar from their predecessors, or the Mayan culture has been around muchlonger than previously thought.image [images/img_030.jpg]Figure 30image [images/img_031.jpg]Figure 31The excavators and restorers did an excellent job. Copán is a world ofincomprehensible art, a visual feast for any viewer. The pyramids are not simplymade of four sloped triangular sides pointing to heaven, for they are packedwith reliefs and small figures created with the smallest details (figure 32).From the temple walls fly down figures with aureoles (figures 33 and 34), whichelsewhere in Tulum (for example) are described as “bee gods.” (I will come backto that momentarily.) The inner rooms, however, are bare—at least today (figure35).image [images/img_032.jpg]Figure 32image [images/img_033.jpg]Figure 33image [images/img_034.jpg]Figure 34In contrast to Tikal, Copán was built directly on the Motagua-Tal River. Therewas enough water here. People cut channels in monolithic blocks and sunk theminto the floor. Some of these antique water pipes still function today (figures36 to 38). We are not only components of an evolution but with our actions aresubject to an evolutionary process: like technology. Originally our ancestorslived in nature, in caves, and under rock overhangs. Then they discovered thespear and the bow, and figured out how to build huts. Stonework followed, aswell as construction of houses, temples, and pyramids. But behind all of it wasplanning. Which intellectual giant designed the phenomenal plumbing system ofCopán? How many centuries was this before the “evolution of technology”?image [images/img_035.jpg]Figure 35image [images/img_036.jpg]Figure 36image [images/img_037.jpg]Figure 37image [images/img_038.jpg]Figure 38Does Copán bear any relation to a cargo cult? Were mysterious things found inthe ruin fields that would indicate a not understood ancient technology? Itsounds like it. I begin with the “anthropomorphic representations,” which areimpressive stone blocks that often—but not always—lie in front of the pyramids.They are called anthropomorphic because the artfully carved monoliths showedmixtures of people, animals, and glyphs that hardly anyone understands (figures39 to 41). There, into the middle of the chaos of incomprehensible artworks,dive two lower legs with shod feet (clearly visible in the middle of figure 42).Picasso had some true friends here. Then a figure crouching in the lotusposition, scratching with its fingers what looks like an Asian head covering(figure 43). This could have come directly from Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Inaddition, the excavators, in the confusion of blocks, found some with stonegears, which could not be placed anywhere (figures 44 to 46). The forest ofquestion marks grows. Finally, irrelevant to the orthodoxy are the inexplicablespheres that turn up in many representations. We do not have the slightest ideawhy the stonemasons placed these spheres in their chaotic artwork. Each of thefigures numbered 47 to 50 exhibits such a sphere. What did they mean? Buteverything ultimately has a reason for the artist. No one chiseled perversethings into the structures, probably due to the supervision of priests.image [images/img_039.jpg]Figure 39image [images/img_040.jpg]Figure 40image [images/img_041.jpg]Figure 41image [images/img_042.jpg]Figure 42image [images/img_043.jpg]Figure 43image [images/img_044.jpg]Figure 44image [images/img_045.jpg]Figure 45image [images/img_046.jpg]Figure 46image [images/img_047.jpg]Figure 47image [images/img_048.jpg]Figure 48image [images/img_049.jpg]Figure 49The artwork of the Maya can be readily compared with that of ancient Egyptianand ancient Indian art. In all places multicolored reliefs were created fromreligious thought. And in India, just as in Central America, the same steeppyramids with their ornate stuccowork can be found. What belief led to theinitial spark? We basically do not experience anything different today. In themain and side altars of our cathedrals, scenes from the New and Old Testamentswere represented. Archangels are accompanied by cherubs residing in the heavens.“God the Father” is enthroned between the stars and directs the grandioseevents. Holy figures go to heaven and are hailed as “heavenly hosts.” Floatingover the main altar of the Serbian cloister Dečani (Kosovo, by Peć) are twoveritable UFOs with stars on their edges and a type of back beam (one is shownin figure 51, the other in figure 52). A person sits in each of these flyingspheres. The one on the right looks like it is being followed by the one on theleft. The Crucifixion scene together with the UFOs in the cloister of Dečani inKosovo are from the twelfth century. What in the world inspired the painter?image [images/img_050.jpg]Figure 50The same question is valid for the entirety of religious art from antiquity,regardless of location. Understandably, people have fabulous imaginations—butthey also need inspiration. In Copán, images of priest-princes were sometimesshown with complicated stuccowork above their heads, which represents “thecelestial” (figure 53). The priests themselves carried wide square beams intheir hands (figure 54). One school of thought believes this represents the“scepter” of the ruler. That being said, because in this case I do not believein the scepter variant, one question bugs me: Where does the idea of the sceptercome from? Some type of powerful tool in the hands of rulers? A former weapon,cribbed from the gods? The question is not as dumb as one might think. Wheredoes the concept of the haloes of the angels and saints come from? Why do angelsclearly have wings? Because they are coming from heaven? Which heaven? The oneof religious bliss or of the cosmos? Why does the bishop wear a tall hat and thepope a tiara? Why must the priests of all cultures change into especially cleanclothing, before they can get closer to God? There is logic behind this seemingnonsense.image [images/img_051.jpg]Figure 51image [images/img_052.jpg]Figure 52image [images/img_053.jpg]Figure 53image [images/img_054.jpg]Figure 54Experts are most certainly right when they argue that gods and high priests wererepresented there. But neither one nor the other originate from the air. Theserepresentations are definitely not of nature gods, as is often argued. They arenot about the elements, thunder and lightning, earthquakes, or volcanoes. Thequestion, which I graphically underline, is: What kind of gods? Which jewels,which ceremonial garments and modeled objects were worn by these gods andpriests? Like a monkey, a person is also a great imitator, who imitates what hedoes not understand. Cargo cults verify that.The helmets of the curious Mayan representations are something else. They arebeautiful artistic images full of unexplained symbolism (figure 55). Above theheads are always beams of fire (figures 56 to 58). And then there are thepuzzling boxes on the chest. Figures 59 and 60 demonstrate this clearly. Withten fingers, a keyboard was operated. These things must have certainly had apurpose. Did they make sounds with which one could unlock a device? Or wereoscillations created, or simple control panels for a foreign technology that wascopied a long time ago from some gods? Mind you, I do not believe that the Mayainvented any type of computer, because that is completely wrong. Whether thisscheme works for you or not, the chest boxes with keyboards are present, andthey are surely used by ten fingers without gloves (figures 61 and 62).Similarly unexplained are the obviously heavy devices between the legs (figure63). This has nothing to do with a loincloth, as someone might try to convinceyou.image [images/img_055.jpg]Figure 55image [images/img_056.jpg]Figure 56image [images/img_057.jpg]Figure 57image [images/img_058.jpg]Figure 58image [images/img_059.jpg]Figure 59image [images/img_060.jpg]Figure 60image [images/img_061.jpg]Figure 61image [images/img_062.jpg]Figure 62image [images/img_063.jpg]Figure 63I was also on the track of a misunderstood technology in the open-air storeroomof Copán. There lie the upper bodies of figures with chests where the largeroperating elements must be worn (figures 64 and 65). This time there are no tenfingers on the keyboard but the fists grasp a lever on both sides, comparable tothe hand-gas operation of today’s machines. The hanger assembly into which thepast technology had to lock is certainly there. In addition, this frame alsohangs on wide bands over both shoulders. Cargo cult?image [images/img_064.jpg]Figure 64image [images/img_065.jpg]Figure 65The stele in figures 66 and 67 is difficult to interpret even for experts (lowerand upper part). Undoubtedly the entire body enclosed a figure of radiance. Theremainder is hocus-pocus for our eyes, just like the outstanding character infigure 68. Among other things, it has a beard. The Central American Indians didnot have beards.And finally, two enlightening epiphanies for the classicists’ contemplation.What served as the model for the representation of Asians in the lotus position(figure 69)? After all, we are not in a South Indian temple district but inCentral America. The guy squats with crossed legs in the upper window of thestele, and even the sideways toes were not forgotten. This was, by the way, nota whim of the stonemasons. In Olmec Park in Villahermosa (Mexico), hiscolleagues meditate in the same manner (figures 70 and 71). Are these influencesfrom India? How so? But there were no connections for centuries between Asia andCentral America!image [images/img_066.jpg]Figure 66image [images/img_067.jpg]Figure 67image [images/img_068.jpg]Figure 68image [images/img_069.jpg]Figure 69I have a special cargo-cult feast to offer the clever critic. What the uniqueartwork reveals serves as an eye-opener (figure 72). The representations on bothsides of the headdress are inexplicable. But in the bottom right of the image,four fingers, the back of the hand, and the thumb are recognizable. They clearlyoperate a device of a technical nature. A weapon? A type of pneumatic drill? Thehandles of a so-called rocket belt—a one-man flying device?I do not have an answer. But the imitation of a technical device shouldjustifiably be in the discussion just as much as the belief in somepsycho-religious ceremonial odds and ends. I can now hear the experts saying“All wishful thinking and humbug!” Ultimately, I am familiar with theinterpretations of the more honorable archaeologists. But this “humbug”resonates in many people’s ears, as I will show.image [images/img_070.jpg]Figure 70image [images/img_071.jpg]Figure 71In the fall of 1992, Ricardo Agurcia, the director of excavation of the CopánProject, discovered a subterranean temple. The aboveground part was named“Temple No. 16,” and the subterranean part was named “Rosalia.” Understandably,“Temple No. 16 is newer because it was built over “Rosalia.” A spiral shaft ledthe excavators to a lower level, where a few isolated paintings appeared on thewalls. There the men suddenly stood in front of a massive wall, painted withblue and red colors. On this wall hung the masks of gods—or human faces—and thatof a supposed bird god as well as various ornaments, some of which still havenot been deciphered. From that point there was a shaft that led even deeper intothe cliff. Now the experts hoped to find indications of the founders of the cityof Copán. Finally, even deeper, they discovered a chamber with a powerful,hermetically sealed sarcophagus. This must be it! The city father of Copán mustbe buried here! Chisels were wedged between the sarcophagus and the heavy lid,and the slab raised centimeter by centimeter. But the work was suddenly stopped.Mercury vapor rose out of the sarcophagus. The four working directly on thesarcophagus lid struggled for air and had to be quickly carried to the top.Mercury poisoning can be deadly. The next group could work only with gas masks.To the total amazement of the archaeologists, the sarcophagus held a sticky,mercury-containing mass. Still a bit deeper was the crypt of a woman and asarcophagus with puzzling additions, concerning which duly competentarchaeologists still remain silent today.Three years after this discovery I spoke with the excavation leader at Copán, ahighly educated Honduran who studied archaeology at Yale University. “Why ismercury in a hermetically sealed sarcophagus under a pyramid” I wanted to know.“Mercury is a color enhancer,” the scholar said self-confidently. “The Maya usedit to highlight the colors in their frescoes.”The simple answer, which in science is required, is nonsensical in this case.Even if mercury were used as a color enhancer, it would not be stored deep undera pyramid. Mercury has the properties of a precious metal, and it is very stablein its pure form. The silvery stuff solidifies into a crystallized mass at atemperature of −38.83° Celsius (−37.89°F). At 357° Celsius (674.6°F), it beginsto boil. But it evaporates at still lower temperatures. Strangely, mercurydissolves most other metals, such as lead, copper, silver, and gold—but all athigher temperatures. Curiously, iron, silicon, nickel, and manganese cannot bedissolved. So how can mercury be stored, when it itself dissolves gold? Storageis only possible in glass, glazed stoneware (jars), or mica. Where does mercurycome from? It can be released easily from ores. Steam or vinegar could be usedfor this process. In antiquity, quicksilver was attributed to the planetMercury. Many peoples processed mercury. Aristotle (fourth century BCE) calledit “liquid silver,” and Theophrastus described mercury extraction in 315 BCE.image [images/img_072.jpg]Figure 72image [images/img_073.jpg]Figure 73But the discovery of mercury at Copán is not unique. Smaller mercury discoverieswere also made in Palenque and Teotihuacán (Mexico). Are mercury vapors possiblythe reason for the protective helmets, masks, hoses, and boxes on the back?But mercury discoveries were also made elsewhere. Even in the grave of Chineseemperor Qin Shi Huang (third century BCE) or in Egyptian graves on Mount Nabta,1,350 kilometers (839 mi.) south of Cairo. There, two crypts were decorated withpaintings of the goddess of heaven, Hathor. The skeletons could not be assignedto a dynasty, but in a stone jar was a crystallized mercury paste.In ancient India, mercury (and carbide, incidentally) served as a fuelingredient of flying machines. According to ancient Indian texts, this mercurywas always transported and stored in airtight containers. These tote-boxes weremade of mica.6 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn10] So it does not surprise me thatmica containers were found not only among the Maya, but also in Teotihuacán inthe Mexican highlands and in North America. (I have more to say about that in mylast book.7 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn11]) Mica is not only a phenomenalelectrical insulator but is also heat and acid resistant.Anyone who also knows the temples of the Maya as well as those in south India isstunned by the parallels. Both places have brightly colored sculptures, figuressitting in the lotus position, polytheism, ornate stuccowork, and mythologies instone. Both places also have step pyramids. The pyramids in south IndianKanchipuram (figure 73) do not look different from those in Tikal. The tops ofthe Mayan pyramids are crowned with a small temple, a dwelling or landing placefor the gods. On the pyramids of south India there is a Vimana, a vehicle of thegods. In both places, people have similar skin colors, faces, and gestures, andeven the modern cities have developed similarly. Indian madras can be found asfrequently in Mérida (Yucatán, Mexico). Without being able to verify it clearly,I sensed an obvious similarity between the holy cities of Central Americas andsome in south India. Did some ancient Indians land in Central America, or was itreversed? If one follows the traditions, neither group could have sailed acrossthe oceans, but they could have flown.The readers of my previous books know about antique flying notions. It isclearly documented with sources.8 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn12] In India, oneof these flying groups was called the Martus. In extensive texts they weredescribed as:Praise . . . which grows in the far sky or in the great expanse of the heavens.. . . Come here, Marut, from the heavens, from the air, do not stop in thedistance. Your brightly flashing men in the terrible missiles, as violent as thewind, mountain shaking, Marut of thundering force. You go through the night, thedays, you skilled ones, through the air, the spaces, you shakers. . . . In oneday, you reach the end of the road and you stride across it the with power. . .. Where you, Marut, decide to go, you go, and fly in the heavens and on theearth.9 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn13]In ancient India, there were thousands of manuscripts—in Central America, too.While a large part of the ancient literature in India survived—always copied inmonasteries—the Mayan manuscripts were tragically destroyed by the Spaniards.(Three manuscripts survived the chaos, but most of the writing isuntranslatable.) Yet a few experts that specialize in the Parisian and Madridcodices—two of the preserved Mayan manuscripts—believe that they are about thewars between the gods in the heavens. Nothing is different in ancient Indianliterature. For the majority of Mayan books a text comparison is not possible.In Indian literature no infrastructure appears for the creation of flyingapparatuses—the so-called Vimanas. No workshops exist in which flying objectscould be created, and there were no test flights, no evolution of technology.The flying monsters were simply there. The infrastructure came from outside:from the cosmos.Yet the fact of the flying gods and people exists not only in India. Inantiquity there was also flying in Sri Lanka, in China, or between Jerusalem andEthiopia.10 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn14] And the gods always came from above.Critics believe that this is entirely normal, because where else would gods comefrom than the clouds? People then had only to look upward and expect salvationfrom above. This viewpoint is legitimate, but what is bothersome here is theomnipresent technical aftertaste. The god-priests with their keyboards on theirchests, which are operated with ten fingers, with their hanger assemblies, theirhelmets, hoses, and boxes on their backs, their fists, clasping the technicaldevices—all are now present. If this strange ornamentation can be found in onlyone place, I would not say a word about it. There is also the phenomenon of thenot-understood ceremonies that migrated into the religions and sculptures. Andthe baffling head assemblies leave open questions that have never beensatisfactorily answered by archaeology. Maybe because the cargo element was nottaken into account. And prehistoric aviation is something like a mortal sin inthe school of archaeology. Sacrilege.image [images/img_074.jpg]Figure 74image [images/img_075.jpg]Figure 75image [images/img_076.jpg]Figure 76image [images/img_077.jpg]Figure 77What did the ancient Indian texts say that honored the divine Maruts? “Praise .. . which grows in the far sky or in the great expanse of the heavens. . . .Come here, Marut, from the heavens, from the air, do not stop in the distance.Your brightly flashing men . . .” Figures 66 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig66] and67 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig67] do not show anything different; both arearranged so their bodies are fully surrounded by rays.Tulum is on the Caribbean coast of Mexico. It was a city built according to aplan. The main streets run parallel to the north-south direction, and the templeis raised on multiple levels similar to the white lighthouses on the green-blueCaribbean Sea (figures 74 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig74], 75[9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig75] and 76 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig76]).Today, Tulum is a truly dreary place of ruins, which is located slightly off thetourist route. The temples of Tulum were, according to the prevailing view,sacred to the bee god. Artistic sculptural representations show anything but anindustrious honey collector, mainly figures with thoroughly human faces flyingdown from the sky. Their legs are always pointing upward and the helmeted head,if it has not been cut off, points toward the earth (figures 77 to 81).image [images/img_078.jpg]Figure 78image [images/img_079.jpg]Figure 79image [images/img_080.jpg]Figure 80The relief in the main temple of Tulum is difficult to recognize. Yet the spreadlegs can be seen, and the shoes seem to be on something like bearings. The armsare angled, and I would love to press joysticks into the fists(figures 82 and 83). Even the wings are stylized right and left, and thejumpsuit with the helmet make for a perfect god descending from the heavens.image [images/img_081.jpg]Figure 81image [images/img_082.jpg]Figure 82image [images/img_083.jpg]Figure 83image [images/img_084.jpg]Figure 84image [images/img_085.jpg]Figure 85A bee? I think we have forgotten to see what there is to see. In the stuccorepresentations of Tulum, I see misunderstood technologies. Presumably nostonemason observed any type of being that comes headfirst out of the clouds.But the religious tradition taught them that once a humanlike being withmysterious gadgets came from above. These mysterious teachers have promised toreturn, and people anxiously awaited the arrival of any all-powerful gods fromthe past. The motif of headfirst, down-moving gods was not confined to Tulum.They also exist in other Mayan locations. Here are some examples from ChichénItzá (figures 84 to 87).image [images/img_086.jpg]Figure 86image [images/img_087.jpg]Figure 87image [images/img_088.jpg]Figure 88In Olmec Park in La Venta—which lies in Villahermosa, Mexico—stand powerful,plump heads with tightly fitting helmets (figure 88). They were found a fewkilometers apart in the marsh of the surrounding area. Gods? Priests? Warriors?We do not know. The so-called dragon monolith can be admired in the same park.Here, in a closed chamber, sits a human form with its helmet—the dragon. In itsright hand it carries a rod, and a square box hangs over its head (figure 89).Did people want to represent the flying monster with the fire-breathing dragon?And finally there is Stele No. 3. It measures 4.27 meters (14 ft.) by 2.03meters (6.66 ft.). Unfortunately many parts of the artistic representation havecrumbled. After all, one recognizes on the upper right part a figure with ahelmet floating above. The figure points downward in an instructive gesture, andits legs are directed upward (figures 90 and 91).image [images/img_089.jpg]Figure 89image [images/img_090.jpg]Figure 90Things are not much different in our churches when we place the angels betweenthe heavens and the earth.My pictures from the world of the Maya should serve as food for thought and leadto new questions. Indeed, archaeology collects and arranges facts, but withregard to the imaginative world of the artists who created their splendidsculptures, the archaeology I admire also falls into its own trap of establishedpatterns of thought. The “heavenly” is not only a starry canopy, the expression“heaven” is not only a place wished for after death. Heaven is also outer space.And there are various old texts describing people who are brought “into theheavens” and are astoundingly brought back to earth intact, which shows that“heaven” can be a misunderstood description of “the mother ship in orbit.” Sucha visit “to heaven” (in the mother ship) was described for millennia bydifferent people, among them figures such as Enoch and Abraham.11[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn15] And all this before the big flood. People havemarveled at the firmament since Adam’s time, and not only because it is silent,mysterious, and infinite but also because unexplainable objects moved there andvisited the earth with “smoke and fire” (figure 92). This is described in thetext of the divine Maruts: “which grows in the far sky or in the great expanseof the heavens . . . Come here, Marut, from the heavens, from the air, do notstop in the distance . . . and fly in the heavens and on the earth.”image [images/img_091.jpg]Figure 91It is clear that “heaven” was never meant to be a place of bliss after death.“Heaven” was “outer space.” This is valid for countless old texts from IndianSanskrit schools, for Solomon’s air cars in the Ethiopian Kebra Nagast, for thebook of Enoch, the “Abraham Apocrypha,” and the Old Testament:12[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn16]It rained down brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah from the Lord of theheavens. . . . (Genesis 19:24)It came to pass in the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month . .. the heavens opened up. . . . I saw something come like a whirlwind from thenorth and a large cloud surrounded from beaming grace and an incessant fire . .. and their legs were straight and glistened like ore. . . . I further saw awheel on the ground . . . and the four wheels were of the same shape. (Ezekiel1:1ff.)Any citation will attest: “heaven” actually meant outer space. The samedetermination is also valid for some Pyramid Texts of ancient Egypt13[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn17] or for the “legend of the winged solar discs.”“Thereafter, the hat of Hor flies toward the sun in a shape of a large sun discwith wings . . . as he saw enemies from the heavenly height . . . he stormedthem so violently that they neither saw nor heard him.”14[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn18]And what does all of this have to do with Central America? The heavenly beingsof the Maya and their ancestors were the same extraterrestrial astronauts aselsewhere. And they left their traces not only in misunderstood technologies, inunidentifiable attributes of godly statues—but also in monumental structures.image [images/img_092.jpg]Figure 92image [images/img_093.jpg]Figure 93image [images/img_094.jpg]Figure 94"},{"pageContent":"2Places to Honor the GodsApproximately 40 kilometers (25 mi.) northeast of Mexico City lie the grandioseruins of Teotihuacán (figure 93). In July of 1520, Hernando Cortes, theconqueror of Mexico, rode past and did not notice the massive installationsconcealed under the hills. The Aztecs always knew, but they did not speak aboutit. The word Teotihuacán stems from this location and means “the place where onebecomes God.” The conscientious Franciscan missionary Bernardino de Sahagún(1499–1590) noted: “They named the place Teotihuacán, because it was the burialplace of the gods.”1 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn19]Presumably the old Indians were right. By means of ground-penetrating radar inthe summer of 2009 a tunnel was in fact located under the ruins of Teotihuacánat a depth of 12 meters (39 ft.). As in the ancient pyramids of Giza (Egypt)high-tech robots were also recently used in Mexico (figure 94). A four-wheeledmachine with the name Tlaloque I left tracks of 124 meters (407 ft.) anddiscovered three chambers that were blocked with tons of heavy monoliths.Something immense lies under the buried area. Teotihuacán was a holy place, apilgrimage site for honoring the gods. Bernardino de Sahagún noted: “During thenighttime, as the sun does not shine, it is said that the gods gathered andadvised them at this place, which was named Teotihuacán.”2[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn20]These divine gatherings included Citlalicue, goddess of the starry sky, and thered Tezcatlipoca, the god with starry robes. According to another tradition,3[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn21] Quetzalcoatl/Kukumatz, the god of the moon andthe morning star, was also present during the deliberations. Tensions and hopeare running high regarding the discovery of an explosive finding in thesubterranean chambers. Finally, no one would enclose three rooms under the earthwith massive stones—if they were empty or contained unimportant objects.It is unknown who built Teotihuacán. Laurette Séjourné, who was thearchaeologist leading the excavations of Teotihuacán for years, noted:The origins of this high culture represent the most inaccessible of secrets. . .. If it is difficult to accept that cultural characteristics were found in thebeginning of their definitive imprint, so it is more difficult to conceive thatthe corresponding complex spiritual conditions—fully formed—suddenly simplyexisted. We do not have any material evidence for this astounding process ofdevelopment.4 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn22]What Ms. Séjourné missed is the evolution of technology. According to theprevailing view, Teotihuacán was built somewhere between 500 BCE and 650 CE.That is a long time period, but in every generation, the architects and buildersmust have kept ancient plans. (I personally maintain that the origins ofTeotihuacán are much older.) Such an architectural constraint can only beunderstood by the influence of a powerful, all-controlling religion.image [images/img_095.jpg]Figure 95image [images/img_096.jpg]Figure 96image [images/img_097.jpg]Figure 97With its large surface area and its perfect infrastructure, Teotihuacán is stilla place of wonder today. From north to south, Grand Street, called Camino de losMuertos (Street of the Dead) is 40 meters (131 ft.) wide and three kilometers(1.86 mi.) long. It is flanked on both sides with smaller pyramidal platforms.In the northern direction the boulevard has a slope of 30 meters (98.4 ft.), andan optical illusion is created, one for which every visitor still falls. Fromthe south—that is, from below—the tourist sees endless evenly sized steps thatfinally merge with the moon pyramid at the end of the avenue (figure 95[9781591432364_c02.xhtml#fig95]). Conversely, when observed from the otherdirection, all steps—abracadabra!—disappear, and observers see only the 3kilometers of the Street of the Dead in front of them (figure 96).Viewed from the moon pyramid, to the left is the largest monumental structure ofMesoamerica—the sun pyramid (figures 97 and 98). It has a square base of222 meters (728 ft.) by 225 meters (738 ft.) and is 19 meters (62 ft.) tallerthan the moon pyramid at the end of the boulevard. Nevertheless, the observer onthe pyramid top forms an impression that both structures are the same height onthe basis of the slope in the Street of the Dead. Incidentally, the sun pyramidis even of more massive proportions than the Pyramid of Cheops in Giza. InEgypt, the pyramids were built with monoliths, heavy stone blocks; inTeotihuacán, they were built with smaller stones and millions of air-dried claybricks. As paint residues demonstrate, the pyramids were previously painted inloud colors. Today, gigantic figures, which once stood there, are missing fromthe flattened pyramids. A 3-meter (9.8 ft.) tall, 22,000-kilogram (48,502 lb.)heavy statue once lay at the foot of the moon pyramid, and a silver andgold-plated deity stood at the sun pyramid. It still existed during the time ofthe Spanish conquerors, but the first bishop of Mexico, the Franciscan Juan deZumárraga (1468–1548), allowed them to be ground up and melted down.5[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn23]image [images/img_098.jpg]Figure 98The third-largest structure of Teotihuacán is the citadel with the Quetzalcoatltemple. Where—by the way—all these name choices are absurd. They did not stemfrom the builders. Quetzalcoatl was the flying god of the Aztecs and Maya, andthe “citadel” has as little to do with a fortification as a Hindu temple withZurich’s central railway station. And the names moon pyramid, sun pyramid,Street of the Dead, and so on, are all inventions of our world. After all, theso-called Quetzalcoatl temple is the most beautiful and richest stucco-decoratedstructure of Teotihuacán. Feather-adorned snake heads wind through theperipheral frieze, and masks of demonic beings gawk from the slopes of the stonewalls (figures 99 and 100). The motifs of the Quetzalcoatl temple confirm thatthe emblem of the winged snake god was known to the Aztecs and Maya for a longperiod of time. The representations are almost identical to the laterrepresentations of the god Quetzalcoatl of the Aztecs or Kukulkan/Kukumatz ofthe Maya. Paintings were found in the interior of some structures of Teotihuacánthat no one is quite clever enough to interpret. Indeed, there was talk about ajaguar or puma god, but what he spews or eats is not identifiable (figure 101),just like the flying heads with their confusing head constructions (figure 102).image [images/img_099.jpg]Figure 99image [images/img_100.jpg]Figure 100image [images/img_101.jpg]Figure 101Meanwhile, Teotihuacán has been proven to be a grandiose model of our solarsystem. This was discovered by U.S. engineer Hugh Harleston Jr., who worked atTeotihuacán for years.6 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn24] Being an engineer,Harleston thought that each plan had a unifying measure, and in the structuresof Teotihuacán overall, he found a measurement unit of 57 meters (187 ft.) or amultiple thereof, or that buildings stood in distances from each other that weredivisible by 57. Along the Camino de los Muertos all structures are separated by114 (2 × 57) or 342 (6 × 57) meters. The wall of the citadel measures exactly399 (7 × 57) meters.Harleston was searching for a smaller measure: he divided 57 by 3. Theresult—19—spoke to more structures whose side lengths were exactly 19 meters.Given his profession, he thought there would be smaller measures, and he soughtto find the smallest measurement that was associated with all Teotihuacánstructures. He found it with 1.059 meters. He called this measure hunab—a Mayanword that means something similar to unity. All measured data have series ofmultiple hunabs.The Quetzalcoatl pyramid and the sun and moon pyramids are, respectively, 21,42, and 63 hunab tall. Their heights are in relation to one another as 1 : 2 :3. Computer analysis found something astounding: the ground plan of theQuetzalcoatl pyramid corresponds to the millionth part of the pole radius(= circumference of the earth at the Arctic Circle). Harleston also discoveredat the citadel multiple Pythagorean triangles, the number pi, as well as thenumber 299,792, which is known to us from the speed of light (229,792 km/h).The pyramid frustums and the platforms of the citadel stood for the averageorbital periods of planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Directly behind thecitadel flows the San Juan River in a man-made canal dug by the originalbuilders. This canal lies in the place exactly where the asteroid belt liesbetween Mars and Jupiter in our solar system. A creek with many stonessymbolized the asteroid belt with its hundreds of thousands of protruding rocks.Piece by piece the buildings on the Street of the Dead are a model of our solarsystem (figure 103). In the extended line behind the moon pyramid (figure 104)is a hill. There Harleston found the ruins of smaller temples that earlier stoodfor the outer planets Neptune and Pluto. All distances are correct, preciselymeasured in hunabs.image [images/img_102.jpg]Figure 102image [images/img_103.jpg]Figure 103image [images/img_104.jpg]Figure 104Thus it becomes astronomical. At the time of the creation of Teotihuacán,regardless if this happened two or four thousand years ago, the builders couldnot have known anything about the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Eventhe planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were unknown at the time. Uranus wasfirst discovered in 1781. Neptune was added to the list of planets in 1846, andPluto just joined in 1930. Recently, the International Astronomical Union (IAU)agreed to change the planetary status of Pluto. With its 6,000 kilometer (3,728mi.) circumference, the astronomers argued that it is too small to be a planet.This does not change anything because Pluto has been in orbit around the sun formillennia. It does not matter if it is classified as a planet or dwarf planet.Understandably, people did the dirty work of Teotihuacán. There were people whodried clay bricks, transported stones, and piled them on top of one another.People dug tunnels and mixed colorful chemicals. But the directors behind it allcame from elsewhere. Everywhere in the past people were able to accomplishformidable architectural feats. Why? Where is the incentive, the enthusiasm? Theanswer is always: for the gods. To honor the gods, to find favor with the gods,to be liked and not punished by the gods. We therefore have phenomenalceremonial sites across the globe. These gods were not forces of nature, wereneither sun, nor moon, nor volcanic eruptions. Why not? Because the gods spoke,because they had precise instructions and many people were instructed, asrecorded in countless traditions. The gods never dirtied their hands. They neverengaged in the practical and difficult work (apart from the creation of smallerbasecamps for themselves).In Teotihuacán—and elsewhere in Maya Land—the birth of the gods is demonstratedevery day. On the large area of the citadel is an approximately 30-meter (98.4ft.) tall wooden pole, anchored firmly in the ground. Four Indians in paintedshirts and colorful hats stand in front of it and place small flutes to theirlips. Sometimes with lowered, sometimes with heaven-turned heads, they dancearound the pole. One of them beats a small hand drum. Then each of them climbsthe mast, pulling a rope behind him. At the very top the rope is tied around theright ankle. On an agreed signal, all four men tilt backward from the mast andfall below. The rope prevents an abrupt fall, and the men turn in wide circlesaround the pole. Their arms are spread apart like wings (figures 105 to 109).The length of the rope is calculated so that each man circles the pole exactlythirteen times before he then touches the earth with his hands. All of this hasa meaning in the Mayan calendar. There are four men with thirteen turns, so4 × 13 = 52. Two-hundred and fifty years are in a calendar cycle. The Mayabelieved that every fifty-two years—or multiples thereof—the gods of the starswould come back to earth.image [images/img_105.jpg]Figure 105image [images/img_106.jpg]Figure 106image [images/img_107.jpg]Figure 107image [images/img_108.jpg]Figure 108These fliers are named Los Voladores, and the show is nothing other thanmythology in practice, performed for centuries to the present day.

For them, every numbermust be correct and confirmable. In his book Teufelswerk (Devil’s Work),mathematician Paul H. Krannich proves a clear connection between the GreatPyramids of Giza and Teotihuacán.7 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn25] Put the sameteachers behind both places. There is—mathematically—no way around it.image [images/img_109.jpg]Figure 109Independently from this, astronomer Dr. Wolfgang Feix also found a mathematicalconnection between both locations.8 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn26] Additionally,Feix postulated that the sun pyramid of Teotihuacán contained a messagereferring to Alpha Centauri, the star lying closest to Earth. Earlier, expertsbelieved that no planets revolved around Alpha and Proxima Centauri. However,people see that differently now. Calculations based on data from NASA’s Keplertelescope suggest there are at least fifty billion planets in our galaxy alone.One percent of these—and this is the absolute lowest value!—orbit in zonesaround their sun that are neither too hot nor too cold. Fifty billion planetsare in the so-called ecosphere, the living zone. How much do you want to betthat these numbers quickly rise? And do you want to bet that the subterraneancrypts of Teotihuacán turn up something extraordinary? As long as we ordinarycitizens are not denied access as we were regarding the alleged cult objects inthe sarcophagus under the Temple No. 16 from Copán. Or the rooms under thepyramid on the plateau of Giza. As elsewhere, there are some very serious peoplein archaeology, skeptics as well, who consider themselves to be highlyresponsible. Others may not know what they know. But in electronically connectedtimes, in a world of shorter distances, secrecy leads to foolishness. It damagesprecisely the guild to which they belong: archaeology.Not only in Teotihuacán is there a stone monument for the gods—the same is truein today’s tourist metropolis Chichén Itzá in Yucatán. Earlier, expertsdifferentiated between a “new” and “old” realm of the Maya. The Chichén Itzá ofthe tourists is considered a “new” realm, first established around 800 CE. Theold Chichén Itzá, named Chichén Viejo, gets almost no visitors (figures 110and 111). The origins of the old Chichén Itzá are a mystery. When a church fallsto ruin today a new one is built. In this process the Christian symbols stillremain, and they outlast the decay of the old building. The same happened inChichén Itzá. The main god of Chichén Itzá was Kukulkan or Kukumatz(Quetzalcoatl to the Aztecs). The same figure is always meant, and thisKukulkan, according to tradition, comes from a distant land or, for the Maya,from the Morning Star. In Chichén Itzá, the winged snake, or the heavenly beingcrowned with rays of light, is ubiquitous (figures 112 and 113). According toold tales, the face of this god Kukulkan was hidden behind a mask. He supposedlywore a strange hat and was bejeweled with glowing necklaces and ankle bracelets.The Mesoamerican people passed down that they learned the science of mathematicsand astronomy from him, and that he also taught arts and crafts and issuedlaws.9 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn27] His birth was described as supernaturaland, after completing his “developmental aid,” he was pulled up “on the shoresof the heavenly waters”10 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn28] and was immolated ofhis own free will. So in the imaginative world of the Maya he was associatedwith the Morning Star. Another version declares that he was carried away to theheavens, and a third will even tell of Kukulkan climbing onto a magical raft ofsnakes and returning to his homeland. But all traditions have in common thatKukulkan promised to return at a much later time.image [images/img_110.jpg]Figure 110image [images/img_111.jpg]Figure 111image [images/img_112.jpg]Figure 112image [images/img_113.jpg]Figure 113But the most original, “real” Kukulkan, was a “heaven snake,” a “heavenlymonster,” who “came to earth in intervals.”11 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn29]This unrivaled Kukulkan was closely connected from the beginning with Itzamna,the highest heavenly god of the Maya. He was the lord of the heavens enthronedin the clouds. Represented as an old man, his body was decorated with planetarysymbols and astronomical signs, and—contradictions or not—he was at the sametime a kind of two-headed dragon.To honor Kukulkan, astronomy bloomed in the entire realm of the Maya. Theobservatory at Chichén Itzá at first glance looks like a modern observatory(figure 114). Sitting on three terraces, the rotunda rises over the jungle.Inside, winding stairs lead to the highest lookout. There are hatches andopenings that are oriented to specific Mayan star constellations. The Maya weredeeply concerned with Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Pole Star, as well asconstellations such as Orion, Gemini, and the Pleiades. They knew that earth’sorbit around the sun was 365.2421 days. They were also familiar with therelationships between different planets. When Mars is at point X, where is Venusin relation to Jupiter? The Maya knew this. They calculated the orbit of Venusaround the sun so precisely that they were off by only one day in a time span of6,000 years.12 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn30] But the Maya did not exist for6,000 years. They must have obtained their information from an older culture orfrom some heavenly teacher. The Maya even had a table of eclipses for theirgeographical area from which all possible eclipses, whether past or future,could be read.The inconceivable dates of Mayan astronomy shocked Professor Robert Henselingsixty years ago. Henseling studied Mayan astronomy for years and came to thefollowing conclusion:It cannot be questioned that the Mayan astronomers’ star constellations, whichgo back for millennia, can be reliably traced back to a specific type and day. .. . This would be incomprehensible if not in past history, that is, thousands ofyears before the beginning of Christian time reckoning, the correspondingobservations had been made by someone somewhere and reliably handed down tofuture generations. . . . [And further:] Such an achievement importantlypresupposes that since prehistory, a development of a very long duration tookplace (emphasis added).13 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn31]image [images/img_114.jpg]Figure 114Or the other way around: The so-called gods trained some clever Mayan lads inastronomy.But even during and after the Spanish conquest the Chilam Balam books werewritten in Central America. Chilam means “prophet” or “translator for the gods,”and balam means “jaguar.” These books differ from one another by the respectivediscovery location being added to the name. So there is a Chilam Balam book fromMani, one from Balam, another from Chumayel, from Ixil, from Tekax, and so on.The books, in Latin letters, but written in Yucatecan, were created between thesixteenth and eighteenth centuries. The contents were collected by many priestsand transcribed by many hands. The entirety is a mixture of ancient stories andobscure prophecies—making for an often difficult read. The sources, however,from which the priests obtained their information were ancient. These originalsources are missing simply because the Spanish destroyed all Mayan writings(except for three, two of which are almost impossible to decipher). One mightask how that almost five-hundred-year-old book could say anything about theorigin of humanity and the gods. Yet, I know Muslims, for example, who canrecite the Qur´an word for word. I’ve met Christians who have the entire NewTestament memorized, and Jews who on the spot recalled the Torah—the Pentateuchwith the five books of Moses—from memory. Even when they do not know it word forword, many devotees know the essential content of their religion. If in aterrible war all Bibles were reduced to ashes, some priests and religiouslaypeople who survived could resurrect the holy scriptures and write them downagain. The same happened in Central America in the sixteenth century. Priestsand tribal elders collected memories and traditions from the time of the gods.Only the paper on which everything was written was new. The creation of theearth reads in the Chilam Balam book of Chumayel as follows:This is the history of the world in those times, because it has been writtendown, because the time has not yet ended for making these books . . . so thatMaya men may be asked if they know how they were born here in this country. . ..It was Katun 11 Ahau [date], when Ah Mucencah [god traveling down] came forth. .. . Then it was that fire descended, then the rope descended, then rocks andtrees descended.14 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn32]In the Chilam Balam book from Mani, the descent of each of the gods wasexplained: “This is the report of the descent of a god, the thirteen gods, and athousand gods, as the priests of Chilam Balam, Xupan, Nauat . . . instructed.”15[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn33]In addition to these Chilam Balam books in Central America, there also exist oldMexican manuscripts of motley texts with many images, found by the smart abbéCharles-Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg. This abbé had a genius for languages. InMexico he learned Aztec, and with the help of Aztec priests he could decode theancient manuscripts. One of these manuscripts gave Brasseur the name of hisIndian teacher: Chimalpopoca. The text is therefore known as CodexChimalpopoca.16 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn34] According to this codex, the godsfirst created the heaven and the earth, then fire rained down. Afterward, thegods discussed which of them would live on earth in the future: “Grief-stricken,they considered the deity with the starry robe, of the starry realms, themistress in the water, who comes over the people and stomps the earth,Quetzalcoatl.”In the same codex it was also claimed that the sun shone first in the fifthcentury, and in this world age “was grounded the earth, heaven, and the fourkinds of human inhabitants.” It remains incomprehensible how ancient Mexicansknew about the four kinds of human inhabitants.Positively dramatic is the account of a spooky world inferno that is describedas an eerie night of darkened sun: “The second sun was created. Four jaguarswere its symbols of days. It is called the jaguar sun. It is suitable that theheaven collapsed and the sun at that time did not follow its path. At noon itwas directly overhead, and night immediately followed.”What is this about? A shift? An abrupt shift of the earth’s axis? Aninexplicable spectacle in the age of the third sun would lead to an absoluteglobal catastrophe: “It is called fire-rain sun. In this age, it occurred thatfire rained and the people burned. . . . The elders explained that in thosedays, the stony sands that we see today were strewn about and they foamed inbubbly andesitic lava, and then were stored in different reddish rocks.”An unnatural gap exists between Mars and Jupiter where thousands of asteroidstumble about. Even today, the origin of this asteroid belt is controversial. Onetheory holds that the debris comes from an exploded planet. The description inthe Codex Chimalpopoca goes superbly well with this theory. The explosion of aplanet in our solar system would eclipse our sun for months or even years.Cosmic dust would be drawn through the solar system, glowing debris would strikethe earth. White-glowing bombs would shred the thin, delicate skin of ourplanet, and it would shake and rattle—not only from the cosmic projectiles butalso from the displacement of the gravitational forces of the solar system. Theexploded planet knocked the complex structure of the orbits of our planets outof balance. Floods, a darkened sun, and rain of fire were the logicalconsequences. It must have appeared to the inhabitants of earth that the sky wasburning and falling down upon them. All the elements would be raging: the oceanspouring over landmasses, hurricanes lashing bodies of water, and volcanoeserupting everywhere.Is this what was described in Codex Chimalpopoca? The continuation of the dramawas described in the Popol Vuh, the holy book of the Quiché Maya. One can readthere how people wandered aimlessly and struggled to find shelter from theraging violence. Close to starvation, more and more Indians arrived at the topof Mount Hacavitz—which was also called the resting place. They stood freezingin the endless night, huddled around the images of the gods, not understandingwhat was happening:There is no sleep for you, no peace. The lamentations in the innermost part ofyour hearts are large, that the day will not dawn, that it will not be light.Only despondency is in your expressions, sadness and dejection came over you,and you are bewildered by anguish. . . . Oh, if we could only see the sun beborn, you said and spoke with one another. . . . Then the sun came out. Andsmall and large animals rejoiced, all standing on the rivers and in canyons; andthose who were on the peaks of the mountains looked together to where the sunemerged.17 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn35]Generously calculated, the Mayan empire lasted from 1500 BCE to 1600 CE. In thistime span, however, there were no global catastrophes. The Egyptians,Babylonians, Greeks, and also Romans have reported nothing about that. In thepast 3,000 years, the sun was not darkened, and the sky has not burned, no floodhas destroyed the surface of the earth, and no “gods” descended from theheavens. And so one must assume that the events described in the chronicles ofthe Central American Indians occurred before the time of their own existence.Here there is a cross-reference in Greece. There, around 400 BCE, thephilosophers Plato, Socrates, and others gathered. Their conversations weremeticulously transcribed by students who sat behind them. In the dialogue titledCritias, which is about Atlantis, Plato insists that the Egyptians would havepreserved all the records from ancient times in written documents deposited inthe temples prior to the disaster.18 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn36] Afterrecording these temple documents, a war broke out between Atlantis and themainland, which occurred 9,000 years ago. If one calculates from the time ofPlato to then, that is approximately 11,400 years ago. This is odd, because theGreek historian Herodotus, called the father of history, also commented about asimilar time period. In the second book of his Histories, Herodotus wrote abouthis visit to Thebes, which is present-day Luxor. The priests showed him 341statues and gave a brief commentary on each one. These 341 statues correspondedto 11,340 years. Before these 11,340 years, the gods were on the earth: “Sincethese 11,340 years, there were no more gods who mingled with humans in Egypt. .. . And the Egyptians certainly would know this, because they have consistentlycalculated and described the years of the kings and high priests.”19[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn37]Why are there no written records from that time that go back 10,000 years? Lookup Plato:The reason for this is as follows: There have been, and will be again, manydestructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have beenbrought about through the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones, byinnumerable other causes. There is a story, which even you have preserved, thatonce upon a time, Phaëton, the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in hisfather’s chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of hisfather, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by athunderbolt. Now this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declinationof the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth, and a great conflagrationof things upon the earth, which recurs after long intervals. . . (emphasisadded).20 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn38]If Plato is correct, x number of centuries ago a planetary catastrophe must haveoccurred in our solar system: “a declination of the bodies moving in the heavensaround the earth.” How would anyone know about planetary orbits 2,400 years ago?In the seventeenth century, Galileo Galilei was to be killed because of hisplanetary message. The Inquisition wanted that. But everything that Galileopreached could already be gleaned from Plato. Moreover, a planetary catastrophewould have also affected other people on the planet. Finally, the earth is asphere that rotates once around its axis every twenty-four hours.Plato in ancient Greece does not say anything fundamentally different from whatwas handed down by the Maya. There as well were accounts of a worldconflagration, of a sun that disappeared, of terrible natural catastrophes, allof which were caused by the deviation of the heavenly bodies orbiting the sun.The Maya provided some dramatic particulars to the same events that Plato spokeof.For the Maya, even in their new world astronomy served as the most admirable ofall the sciences. They were downright obsessed with it. With it all heavenlyobservations fell into two main categories: first, changes and movements in thefirmament, and second, cosmic catastrophes. This was validated by the Franciscanmissionary and cultural researcher Bernardino de Sahagún (1500–1590). He notonly researched the language of the Aztecs but also that of the Nahua. Thisgroup of Indian tribes already existed at the time of the Toltecs—approximately100 BCE. Their language, Nahuatl, was spoken at the time of Bernardino deSahagún primarily by the rural population. Bernardino de Sahagún was the head ofthe College of Santa Cruz on the Caribbean coast. Countless Indians went thereon and off; Sahagún would sit together with them for weeks, nurturingfriendships and asking them to report to him what they knew about the history oftheir tribes. So arose a transcript of records, the Historia general de lascosas de la Nueva España (General History of Things in New Spain). There, theIndians described their fears regarding phenomena in the sky:At nightfall, people were very scared, hoping, as was said, that luckily thefire driller would not fall. Then people would perish, people would be at theend, and it would last all night. The sun would not rise again so that it wouldbe completely dark. Then would the Tzitzitzimi monster come down and destroy thepeople . . . and no one fell down on the ground, so they said, but peopleclimbed on their rooftops. And so every person suspected, that he should takeheed of the stars, whose names are the Many and the Fire Driller.21[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn39]In the Historia general, “smoking stars” were also mentioned, but it is notclear if this meant meteors or shooting stars. And as the sun disappeared, evensome gods observed the disturbed heavens: “As they say, there were those whowatched there: Quetzalcoatl, whose nickname is Ecatl; also Totec, or the lord ofthe ring; the red Tezcatlipoca; and those that are called serpents of theclouds.”22 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn40]The same Franciscan monk, Bernardino de Sahagún, also described a ball gameplayed by the Mayans as well as the Aztecs in the highlands and that wasoriginally brought to earth by the gods. The Aztecs called this game tlachtli,and an Aztec team demonstrated their tlachtli in a Spanish courtyard. Ithappened like this:After Hernando Cortez (1485–1547) conquered Central America, he came home underfire. Emperor Charles V (1500–1558) ordered him to a hearing in a Spanish court.In addition to the precious loot, the clever Cortez brought an Aztec ball teamto Spain and had them play before high society. The game was played on arectangular court of 40 by 15 meters (approximately 131 by 49 feet) that wasbordered by a wall. Above, on the parapets, sat the royal lords with theirentourage. Spoiled by many daily attractions of diverse kinds, many had becomesettled in their boredom. But soon the conversation of the men in their plushtrousers and ruffs was silenced, and the women waved their ivory-jeweled fansmore quickly. What happened on the playing field below was breathtaking. Nothingcomparable had yet been seen in the Old World.Thoroughly fit, the loincloth-dressed Aztecs played with a five-pound, elasticball made out of a strange material, which they called rubber. The match hadstrict rules: The heavy, black ball could not be touched with the hands or feetand it could not touch the ground. The ball was kept in play throughquick-reacting bodily movements from the hips, shoulders, elbows, thighs, orknees. In a headlong dive, the Indians threw themselves at the ball, hitting itwith any body part other than hands and feet to a fellow player, who tried topass the hard rubber ball through a stone ring set in the wall in the middle ofthe playing field. As much as possible, the opponent should never havepossession of the ball, otherwise he would try, for his part, to knock the ballthrough the ring. A murderous game, in which nasal bones shattered, bones broke,and players heading the ball were knocked unconscious. “Many players werecarried away dead,” reported a witness, “or they sustained heavy injuries ontheir bodies.”23 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn41]This ball game that the Aztecs performed was a thousand years old. The Aztecsadopted it from the Maya, and they in turn had learned it from the gods. That isalso what the bishop Diego de Landa—the same one that allowed Mayan manuscriptsto be destroyed while at the same time compiling a book about theMaya—originally reported: the gods were the players.24[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn42]image [images/img_115.jpg]Figure 115It is no surprise that every large Maya city was equipped with a ball field. InChichén Itzá, there still exist some of the old—and today partiallyrestored—reliefs on the right and left side of the playing field. And no one canfigure them out. Figures 115 and 116 show a priest—if it even is one(!)—with afeather headdress on his head, a tube in his nose, and ear protection. Thefigure is placed in a pompous, apparently padded jumpsuit, closed with a beltbuckle, out of which a “scepter” protrudes. The knee protection and thicklysoled shoes complete the image. But what is the figure holding in his hands?Four fingers are around a handle, secured to a rectangular object. The objectseems to symbolize danger, as the animal snout with the canine tooth indicates.There are many of these guys. The man behind him holds a similar article, thistime angled in the direction of the ground. Slightly modified objects arecarried by other “priests” (figure 117). Cargo cult? Some technology copied fromthe gods? We smart-alecks so far have come up with nothing meaningful regardingthe technological-looking objects. Containers for blood or snake heads arevaguely discussed. A tour guide, whom I listened to while he led a French groupthrough the ball field, surpassed everyone. To the question from a womanregarding what the objects in their hands were, he said: “Those are irons!”Quite simple, right?All people worshipped gods, but the opinions about these gods could not be morecontroversial. In Maya Land the heavenly figures clearly stemmed fromtraditions. They are understood as real, corporeal figures. And in Chichén Itzáthe priests and architects brought it to completion, and their descending godswere immortalized in a structure that still stands today: the Kukulkan pyramid(figure 118). It is 30 meters (98.4 ft.) tall, placed on a square base with a55.5 meter (182 ft.) side length. The structure consists of nine platforms lyingone above the other, which are bisected in the middle with wide staircases. Eachof these four staircases has 91 steps plus the topmost platform. Each stepstands for a day. This results in 4 × 91 = 364, plus the highest platformequals 365—the number of days in a year. Each pyramid side is organized in 52artistically decorated stone panels. Fifty-two years make up the smallest Mayancalendar cycle (figures 119 and 120). While the Egyptian pyramids are set up ina north-south and east-west direction, the north-south axis goes diagonallythrough the Chichén Itzá structure (figure 121). That was the intent. Theastronomical orientation, but also the angle of inclination of the pyramids andthe nine stacked platforms, result in a grandiose spectacle year after year.image [images/img_116.jpg]Figure 116image [images/img_117.jpg]Figure 117At sunrise on December 21 the first rays of the sun shine on the eastern half ofthe pyramid (figure 122). While it gradually climbs higher on the horizon, onthe pyramid’s northern surface and indeed exactly on the edges of the steps, aband of light and shadows can be seen. The effect results from the nineterraces, the angle of inclination, and the astronomical orientation (figure123). Then the light and shadow band creeps slowly down the steps and is unitedat the bottom of the stairs with the head of Kukulkan. Not content with that, onJune 21 the spectacle repeats on the other side of the pyramid, but in theopposite way. At sunset the sun first shines on the head of Kukulkan at thelower edge of the stairs. The lower the sun sinks, the darker waves defined bysunlight creep slowly up the steps (figure 124). During sunset the small templeon the pyramid top is lit up in a bizarre light show. As the sun disappearsbehind the horizon the specter disappears.image [images/img_118.jpg]Figure 118image [images/img_119.jpg]Figure 119image [images/img_120.jpg]Figure 120image [images/img_121.jpg]Figure 121image [images/img_122.jpg]Figure 122image [images/img_123.jpg]Figure 123image [images/img_124.jpg]Figure 124The entire thing is an ingenious demonstration of the highest astronomy andarchitecture in the sign of the gods. The message is crystal clear: the godKukulkan descended from heaven. He stayed with the people for some time, taughtthem, and disappeared again to his starry home to return again at some point.The Kukulkan pyramid of Chichén Itzá demonstrates how astronomers,mathematicians, architects, and priests entrusted their traditions to stone. Italso proves that the entire theoretical knowledge, paired with the technicalknow-how, was present from the very beginning. There are no evolutionary trialruns of the pyramid, no permanent modifications and improvements. Even beforethe construction, the astronomical calculation had to be just as correct as theangle of inclination of the pyramid and the height of the nine platforms. Aperfect stroke of genius created in the past for doubting people of the future.The latest excavations demonstrate something amazing: The Kukulkan pyramidstands on a still more massive platform (figures 125 to 127). The entirestructure, the giant foundation, must have already been there before the pyramidwith the Kukulkan spectacle was built.image [images/img_125.jpg]Figure 125image [images/img_126.jpg]Figure 126The fact that the Maya expected their gods to return is not only evident in thepyramid of Kukulkan in Chichén Itzá but also in Chilam-Balam book of Tizimin:“They arose from the streets with the stars behind them. . . . They spoke themagical language of the stars in the sky. . . . Yes, their sign is our certaintythat they came from heaven . . . and when they descend from heaven again, theywill rearrange what they once created.”25 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn43]image [images/img_127.jpg]Figure 127image [images/img_128.jpg]Figure 128"},{"pageContent":"3Nonstop CuriositiesOn the Pacific coast of Guatemala, not far from Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, theclearing work done in 1860 brought some magnificent Mayan steles to light(today, they are known as the Bilbao monuments.) The native population did notthink much of it because farmers repeatedly would encounter carved stones. Newsof the discovery reached the Austrian Dr. Habel, who explored the region in1862, and had drawings made of the steles. He later showed them in Berlin to thedirector of the Ethnological Museum of Berlin at the time, Dr. Adolf Bastian(1826–1905). He was enthusiastic, and wanted to install the steles in hismuseum, and he traveled to Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa in 1876. There, he boughtthe steles from the owner of the finca (farm) and contractually secured therights to any future discoveries. But the trip from Guatemala to Berlin wasarduous.In the jungle terrain of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa there were neither flatbedwagons nor paved roads. A hastily summoned engineer suggested cutting the stelesin half lengthwise and hollowing out the back sides. And so it happened. Thebehemoths were loaded on oxcarts and transported up to 80 kilometers (50 mi.) tothe San José harbor. When loading them on the ship there was another hitch: Onestele broke loose from its ropes and sank to the bottom of the harbor—where itlies to this day.The remaining eight steles were erected in Berlin and can still be admired atthe entrance to the local ethnological museum. One stele obviously shows anoffering scene with a priest, who is holding a ripped-out heart to the heavens.In the next image, a priest stretches something upward that looks like a facemask. Above him a godly being, surrounded by flames, descends toward the earth(figure 128 [9781591432364_c02.xhtml#fig128] and figures 129 to 131). The nextimage shows a figure engulfed in flames from the head downward. In front of itschest dangles a fire disc, and there, where the feet should be, rudiments ofwings are recognizable.Experts see these representations as an “ode to the sun god.” This is more thanlame. I ask you to compare figures 80 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig80], 81[9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig81], 82 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig82] and 83[9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig83] with figures 128 to 131. In both cases thewinged figures plunge down toward the earth head and hands first. Figures 80 to83 are from Tulum, a place on the Caribbean coast. There, the descending figuresare called bee gods, and this, even though the shod feet of the figures rest onproper platforms. And the fiery flames? I am reminded of the Indian Maruts:“Come here, Marut, from the heavens, from the air. . . . Your brightly flashingmen in the terrible missiles.”image [images/img_129.jpg]Figure 129image [images/img_130.jpg]Figure 130image [images/img_131.jpg]Figure 131It is time to rethink some things.

They carry boxes on their chests, and even the harnesses overtheir shoulders are recognizable (figure 134). With two fingers, they claspobjects that look like drills and taper downward (figure 135). Half of a spokedwheel is also recognizable on their shoes (figure 136).image [images/img_134.jpg]Figure 134image [images/img_135.jpg]Figure 135The experts’ interpretation is completely different. The boxes on their chestsare “butterfly symbols,” the things in their hands are “a bundle of arrows” or“spinning devices,” and the wheels on their shoes are supposedly “flowers.” Thenthe covered ears could be—who knew it?—original headphones with a short antenna.Finally, the headdress in the eyes of the experts is a “box-shaped hat.” Some ofthe Tula statues are even furnished on the backside with engravings. Therestands an Indian adorned with a feathered helmet with a hose through the nose(figure 137) and a figure in squatting position. From head to back, a hose runsinto a tank (figure 138). One can compare this with the stele of El Baúl infigure 26 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig26].If the items of evidence are not an individual case, if they are seeminglywaving from everywhere, if we are speaking about the mythology of “descendedgods” and “teachers,” if Teotihuacán turned out to be the model of the solarsystem and the Kukulkan pyramid of Chichén Itzá shows a light-and-shadow gameyear after year, as if this god descends the stairs, shouldn’t the experts startpricking up their ears?Which experts? The specialists on Maya archaeology? The few that have somethingto say can be counted on one hand. They travel without exception on their oldtracks; new rails are frowned upon. And the diligent students cannot affect theswitch position in any way, because they are only let in if they ride in the oldtrain. Therefore, new thinking must come from the outside, even if it takes ageneration to get attention. After all, the Maya experts do concede theexistence of a prodigious astronomy in their studies—only the gods could neverbe visitors from other stars. One must understand all of this psychologically,it is said with emphatic nodding. And—curiously enough—the currently prevailing“politically correct” line of thought makes the professional immune to any typeof contrarian thinking. If one would see the gods as actual extraterrestrialsthis would denigrate the achievement of the Indians: the pride of the Maya wouldbe violated. This is obviously joined by the blessed doctrine of evolution.image [images/img_136.jpg]Figure 136image [images/img_137.jpg]Figure 137image [images/img_138.jpg]Figure 138People do not trouble themselves to understand another way of looking at things.Evolution, yes—but it does not explain everything. The statements by the expertsignore the fact that the temples and pyramids were built by people. And theremarkable pieces of art and mathematics were created by people. The initialimpulse, however, came from outside. That is now verifiable, and the Maya saythat themselves. The achievement of the people will not be devalued. The BerlinSymphony is not decreased when it plays Rhapsody in Blue, just because thecomposer George Gershwin was an American.image [images/img_139.jpg]Figure 139The Maya were addicted to astronomy. Their buildings and their religion, theirentire spiritual thinking including their astronomically aligned pyramids, proveit. There are, at 1,500 meters (4,921 ft.) high, ruins at Xochicalco in thefoothills of the Ajusco volcano in Mexico. For the temple up there, the Mayaleveled off a mountaintop. The origin of Xochicalco is obscure, and up to now,only the half of all buildings have been unearthed. In the center is the steppedpyramid La Malinche and a so-called palace. Here, too, everything servedastronomy. Two of the pyramids lie across from each other like mirror images(figures 139 to 140). The sun rises at the equinoxes exactly over the centers ofthe buildings.image [images/img_140.jpg]Figure 140image [images/img_141.jpg]Figure 141image [images/img_142.jpg]Figure 142La Malinche stands on a nearly square surface (18.6 × 21 m.; 61 × 68.9 ft.) andis aligned north-south. The outer wall carries magnificent reliefs of eightfeathered snakes that wind themselves around the building as if they are tryingto lift up the platform. On the other side of the world, in China, monsters wereshown as flying dragons (figures 141 and 142). The reliefs were cut withunidentified hard chisels directly in the andesite slabs and seamlessly joinedtogether. Originally the pyramid must have glowed magnificently to the heavens,because paint residues are still stuck between the joints.Ten meters (33 ft.) under the ground there is a room scraped out of the rockthat people called an observatory, accessible through a side entry. From theceiling of the room is a 9-meter (29.5 ft.) long shaft to the surface (figures143 and 144). It is made so ingeniously that year after year, on June 21 atnoon, a unique scenario replays itself.At noon a small procession of Indians with lighted candles enters the room. Theycarry with them amulets and a small vessel of water, which is placed directlyunder the light shaft. Outside, the sun climbs higher, and exactly at 12:30 itstands in the center of the opening. Tentative at first, the beam of lightglides along the walls as if searching; then the band of light broadens until itfills the shaft and illuminates the chamber underneath. Now the light engulfsthe amulets and water tank on the ground, permeating them and causing them toreflect. Like luminous laser fingers they flash around and slowly pass over thepeople with their candles in their hands. This fascinating spectacle lastsapproximately twenty minutes. The Indians, saying prayers, look to the shaftopening over them. As soon as the sun moves on it would become dark in theunderworld if it were not for the flickering light of the small candles. TheIndians take their amulets and water vessel that—according to their beliefs—arenow animated with divine power, and walk silently outside. But then there islaughing, music, dancing, and expressions of gratitude for the divine power.image [images/img_143.jpg]Figure 143image [images/img_144.jpg]Figure 144This occurs every year on June 21, even to this day. This sun cult reminds me ofthe Stone Age installation at Newgrange, 10,000 kilometers (6,214 mi.) away fromMexico in Ireland. Also occurring every year, and for a good 5,000 years now, isa similar spectacle, not on June 21, but on December 21. During the sunrise theblazing sun passes through a deliberately placed rectangular opening. Thesunlight shines down a 24-meter (79 ft.) passageway and, like a laser beam,strikes a stone with various scraped out bowls. The rest is a magical symphony.The rays of light flicker in different directions, at all times directedprecisely at cultic signs, but also above through a dead-straight and artfullymade stone shaft. As in Xochicalco, Mexico.Who actually devised this eccentric sunlight game? And it is not only in Mexicoand Ireland. There are similar examples around the world. Who calculated thedegree slope for the shafts for June 21 in Mexico and December 21 in Ireland?Were divine figures revered in the chambers? Did the astronomers construct theirsquare shafts as a reference to the spectral colors of the rainbow? Werematerials in the room treated so that they could only be seen in polarizedlight? Or was there some kind of luminescence down there that escaped theexcavators?I ask these (dumb) questions for a good reason, because objects of this typewere reported three hundred years ago by the Spanish chronicler FranciscoAntonio de Fuentes (and handed down by John Lloyd Stephens). This is in regardto the city of Patina Mit, the central city of the Cakchiquel Indians:West of the city is a hill that towers above it, and on the hill a small, roundbuilding approximately 1.8 meters (5.9 ft.) tall. In the middle of this buildingis a pedestal made of a shimmering substance that looks like glass, but the trueproperties of this material are not known. Judges sit around this building andadminister their judgments, which are immediately enforced. Before anyenforcement was carried out, however, it was necessary that the judgment beverified through the oracle. For this purpose, three judges would leave theirseats and betake themselves to a notch in the valley. There was the invocationsite with a black, see-through stone, on whose surface the deity appeared andconfirmed the verdict. If no apparition showed up on the black stone, thecondemned person was immediately released. The same stone was consulted aboutdecisions regarding war and peace. Later, Bishop Francisco Marroquin heard aboutthis stone and ordered it smashed to pieces. The largest piece served as thealtar plate of the church of Tecpan in Guatemala.1[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn44]Curious story. Had the Indians once seen the gods in something like a monitorand not understood anything? Over 175 years ago, both Mayan researchers Stephensand Catherwood sought the strange altar stone in the church of Tecpan,Guatemala—but the slab no longer existed. Someone had destroyed it.Central America is a gold mine for fantasists, dreamers, and alternativethinkers—but between the fantasy and erstwhile reality is a narrow seam. Opinioncan fluctuate on both sides. Presently, at the entrance to the Museo Popol Vuhin Guatemala City stand three massive skulls that cannot be attributed to anyone(figures 145 to 147). The eyes are oversized and the “eyeballs” are anything buteyeballs. In front of the nose a rectangular object is stuck—a massive filter?Ludicrous? As a globetrotter and expert on traditions I am put in mind of theAbraham Apocrypha, about whose existence Maya specialists don’t need to know.In that account, the boy Abraham experienced an extraterrestrial encounter. Itis evening and Abraham is working in a field when two “heavenly beings” descend.Abraham specifies that they were “not people.” If they were not humanbeings—then what? They both breathed, but not in the way humans breathe. Abrahamis driven over the earth in a chariot of fire. He sees large figures whose wordshe did not understand, and heads toward a powerful light in the heavens, whichhe cannot describe. In the next sentence it is clear where Abraham was: “Iwanted to fall down on the ground. The high place on which we were stood uprightearly on, but it soon turned downward.”2 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn45]image [images/img_145.jpg]Figure 145image [images/img_146.jpg]Figure 146image [images/img_147.jpg]Figure 147image [images/img_148.jpg]Figure 148When a person wants “to fall down on the ground,” he is hardly on the ground. Inaddition, the “high place” on which Abraham stands constantly rotates around itsown axis. This is exactly what happens in a spaceship in orbit. Throughself-rotation an inner artificial gravity is obtained. The centrifugal forceswork similarly to a spin drier. But no one could have known this thousands ofyears ago. Therefore, my cross-connecting of the stone heads in the Museo PopolVuh having square objects in front of their noses with Abraham’s beings, who“did not breathe like humans.” Still laughable? (And concerning thiscross-connection, God knows it is not the only one.)image [images/img_149.jpg]Figure 149In the Museo Popol Vuh in Guatemala City are helmeted figures to marvel at, thatone—coming from the perspective of cargo cults—could describe as “astronautgods” (figure 148 [9781591432364_c03.xhtml#fig148] and figures 149 to 152). Theconnection to breathing “not in the way humans breathe” (Abraham) is obvious.And on the stele in figure 153, a god greets a priest. In the sky above is acarved figure that simultaneously sits and floats; in the upper right are thethighs with bent knees and legs pointed upward, and on the left the same figurewith the shared upper body, this time seated. This matches the Indian prince inan old Mexican manuscript who flies together with his temple into the clouds(figure 154).image [images/img_150.jpg]Figure 150image [images/img_151.jpg]Figure 151image [images/img_152.jpg]Figure 152image [images/img_153.jpg]Figure 153image [images/img_154.jpg]Figure 154The painter Diego Rivera (1886–1957) created wide-ranging colorful frescoes inthe government building of Mexico City that portrayed the lives of Indiansbefore the arrival of the Spaniards. And here, the flying snake—the godQuetzalcoatl—with his pilot is not absent (figure 155). Traditions in word andimage are the blurry memories of the people.image [images/img_155.jpg]Figure 155Anecdotal flying Indians supposedly still existed at the time of the Spanishconquerors. On March 3, 1524, Pedro de Alvarado battled in the highlands ofGuatemala against a group of Quiché-Maya Indians. Something bewildering happenedthere: “The commander Tecum rose into the air and came flying, transformed intoan eagle, covered in feathers, that grew on their own and were not appliedartificially. He had wings that grew out of his body.”3[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn46]Hocus-pocus? Apparently Captain Alvarado did not fall for any illusion, becausethe flying Indian pierced the body of Alvarado’s horse with an obsidian spear.The Indian thought that the horse and man had grown together as one and that hislance would also kill the rider. This bafflement of the Indians was exploited bythe Spaniards, and they stabbed the puzzled flyers.True or legend? In any case, this place became the location of the encounter ofCaptain Alvarado and the flying Indian named Quetzaltenango. That is still thename of the Guatemalan city. And Guatemala City erected a monument to the flyingIndian commander Tecum (figure 156). The figure wears a long, heavy feathercoat.image [images/img_156.jpg]Figure 156Flying gods, fiery figures that plunge down from heaven, feathered snakes in theskies—although every Indian knew that snakes never fly—monstrous figuresenveloped in rays, helmeted figures with “respirators,” wings everywhere the eyecan see, and a mythology full of celestial masters. And how do we smart-alecksget to be “creation’s crowning glory,” “the pinnacle of evolution,” out of that?Nature religions. More thinking is not permitted.I have the audacity to interpret expressions such as “thunder,” “lightning,”“heaven,” “fire snakes,” and so on, differently from what is allowed by thesacrosanct opinion from the lectern. There it is taught that primitive peopledid not understand natural forces and therefore deified what they did notunderstand. Obviously, there were nature religions, which do not need to beexplained. But—cross my heart—do these natural forces talk, as they clearly doin the lore? Did they establish laws, show themselves to be teachers, explainthe calendar to dumb people—with 365 days and to eight decimal places (countingthe hours making the leap day)?Did a natural phenomenon hand over the Ten Commandments to Moses, and did thelightning teach Enoch writing (before the Flood)? Were the early Maya referringto natural phenomena when they called teachers “great masters of the sciences”?Did thunder create people “according to its own image,” and did the Maya aligntheir temples astronomically only because lightning sometimes flashed from theskies in the north?That the researchers and fluent translators of two generations ago did not comeup with any other sensible interpretations is perhaps understandable. After all,none of our esteemed grandfathers knew anything about notions such as spacetravel and an inhabited universe. The old ideas made it into textbooks—whereelse?—clouding every modern finding since then. Yesterday’s interpretations wereonce reasonable—today they are unreasonable. There are now far more realisticarguments for the meaning of creation myths, such as the approach of naturereligions. I understand the persistence in academics of a certain fear that theacceptance of extraterrestrials could bring about the collapse of a familiar wayof looking. The collapse of a mindset is not the purpose for this book. Thelegitimation for a change in thinking comes from the new way of looking atthings. Science is a living edifice and not a religion that one has to believe.“To realize that one made a mistake is only the admission that one is smartertoday than yesterday,” stated Jonathan Caspar Lavater (1741–1801). No one shouldfeel embarrassed about taking leave of an outdated view. Among such is includedthe undying opinion that the Maya did not know what a wheel was. Why, then, didthey build paved roads?Thanks to countless satellite images, it is long known that Maya cities wereconnected to each other through an extensive network of roads. Sixteen of theseroads began (or ended) in Cobá in the north of the current state ofQuintana Roo. A long loop is formed by a road from Cobá to Yaxuaán, a smallplace not far from the ruins of Chichén Itzá. Aerial images show light bands inthe dark green vegetation of the jungle. That is the road from Cobá, which runsby way of Yaxuná, Chichén Itzá, and Mayapán to Uxmal. That equals a highway of300 kilometers (186 mi.). Another road connects Dzibilchaltún (before Mérida)with the eastern coast of the Caribbean. All roads were paved with small stonesand coated with a light surface. The stretch from Cobá to Yazuná is 10 meters(33 ft.) wide—relatively grandiose for a processional route; fifteen peoplecould have sung side by side.The roads are often divided into ruler-straight sections, the longest of whichmeasures 36 kilometers (22 mi.), and long-drawn stretches with numerousdirection changes, which is no different from our highways. And the Maya werenot familiar with the wheel?!Then why does the Museum of Xalapa have a Mayan children’s toy with wheels(figure 157)? Why can one find in the National Museum of Anthropology in MexicoCity figures that operate a wheel with their legs (figure 158)? The other wheelshave hubs (figures 159 and 160). And obviously the world-renowned calendar ofthe Aztecs is round (figure 161). At some point, stonemasons noticed that roundblocks could roll. In addition, the curve or circle was already known to theMaya. Figures 162 and 163 from the garden of the museum at Xalapa could serve asexamples.image [images/img_157.jpg]Figure 157image [images/img_158.jpg]Figure 158image [images/img_159.jpg]Figure 159image [images/img_160.jpg]Figure 160image [images/img_161.jpg]Figure 161Today’s roads are planned to the foot. How did the Maya solve this problem? Theysupposedly did not have compasses. What surveying tools were used? Was theplanning worked out with the help of beacons? The area is as flat as a fryingpan and overgrown with dense forest. There are no small hills from which signscould be given. A fire in a green thicket is only visible for a few kilometers.Were people sent ahead to draw tight, straight lines and then mark the segmentwith stakes? Possibly. But this solution assumes that lanes were previouslybeaten through the jungle. At some point somebody must have decided how manymiles of the way should run straight and when an elongated curve should befollowed. This is not very easy in a forested area with a visibility of at bestonly two kilometers. Furthermore, in the flat terrain of the Maya there weresmall hollows, watercourses, depressions, and indeed swamps. The Maya leveledthem, built, where needed, arched overpasses and raised sections of road up tofive meters (16 ft.) high. Everything to excess on the procession routes. Thepilgrims would have traveled over the hollows without complaint. Today, we usesteamrollers to press the roads flat. And the Maya? A five-ton roller brokeninto two parts was located in Ekal on the Cobá-Yaxuná route. These 4-meter(13 ft.) long rollers had a hub in the middle through which an axle once passed.But they did not know about the wheel.image [images/img_162.jpg]Figure 162image [images/img_163.jpg]Figure 163Why else would the Maya level their roads if not for the wheel? Why did theybuild roads over marshy terrain with such solid foundations that they still havenot sunk, even today? What would have traveled over these masterfully plannedroads? Sleds with wooden runners? They would have left tracks in the surface.Did the Maya drive pack and draft animals on the roads with them? The consensusis that the Maya knew of neither. Did fast couriers with roller skates maketheir way on the roads? It is not impossible, because carved on the so-calledPalacio in the Mayan city of Palenque is a roller skater (figures 164 and 165).“That’s not true!” exclaim the experts. Said “rollers” mean nothing more thanthe number two. And that, even though little wheels are clearly seen under thefront toe and under the sole of the foot, as the pictures show! In addition, thebuckles firmly fastened to the ankles are also recognizable. So these arenothing but sandals with the number two under them? And if the Maya really movedoff the ground, then they would have no need for any roads. Something hasescaped our cleverly deductive archaeologists.image [images/img_164.jpg]Figure 164These Maya and their predecessors must have been more construction mad than theancient Egyptians. Always in honor of their flying god Quetzalcoatl emergedpyramids more extensive than the Great Pyramids of Giza. One hundred years ago,on top of a grassy hill in Cholula stood the church of Nuestra Señora de losRemedios (Our Lady of Remedies). The Spaniards did not build the church becauseof its beautiful view of the majestic Mount Popocatépetl, but because theywanted to hide a pagan Maya pyramid. Actually, the pyramid of Cholula, with itsbase length of 450 × 450 meters (1,476 × 1,476 ft.) and a height of 66 meters(216.5 ft.), has a larger volume than the Pyramid of Cheops. It’s estimated that4.5 million cubic meters of construction materials are contained in it(figure 166). Terraces of a step pyramid came to the fore, thirty-six stairwaysgoing in different directions and—gasp!—to date a tunnel 5.5 kilometers (3.4mi.) long (figures 167 to 172). Official doctrine says that the constructionbegan in the second century CE and that it was raised in multiple stages. Thelayout—and its age—was compared to the enormous complex of Teotihuacán on theedge of Mexico City. I believe the origins of Teotihuacán lie much further inthe past, and are equal to that of Cholula. Already the piles of rubble thathave grown over it testify to this (compare the debris in figure 167).image [images/img_165.jpg]Figure 165image [images/img_166.jpg]Figure 166The same goes for the phenomenal installation of Monte Albán, located 550kilometers (341.8 mi.) southeast of Mexico City at a height of 1,950 meters (1.2mi.). These ruins are today considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Aselsewhere, the builders first leveled a mountain, all of this prior to 3,000years ago, because the origin of Monte Albán dates back at least to 1000 BCE.The founders of this holy site were supposedly Olmecs, the bearers of thatpuzzling culture that created the massive, helmeted skulls found in Olmec Parkin Villahermosa (figure 88 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig88]).image [images/img_167.jpg]Figure 167image [images/img_168.jpg]Figure 168image [images/img_169.jpg]Figure 169image [images/img_170.jpg]Figure 170image [images/img_171.jpg]Figure 171image [images/img_172.jpg]Figure 172And, in the same park, the figure descending to the people as well as thedark-skinned one who stares toward the heavens in amazement are also Olmec(figures 90 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig90], 91 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig91]and 92 [9781591432364_c01.xhtml#fig92]). These Olmecs founded Monte Albán. Intheir ranks, there must have been geniuses of planning. Who else had the idea3,000 years ago to level a mountain, and this on a giant surface area (figures173 to 177)? Apparently, the planners reckoned that later generations wouldfortify their work and would keep to the established astronomicalorientation—which is what happened. But the geographical point of Monte Albánwas not randomly chosen. The relevant legend tells about a mysterious creatorbeing named Coqui Xee, who slept in a hole in the grotto of “endless time.”4[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn47] Coqui Xee stood outside of the world becausethoughts could not affect him. But on the inside he carried the wish toexperience our world. And so Coqui Xee (who could not be affected by thoughts)gave birth to himself as light and began his long journey as light in the sky.He created people and Xonaxi, who transformed himself into a parrot in order towander the sky. In order not to get lost, Xonaxi painted his path with light.This light trail was named the Milky Way by the Indians. And because Xonaxidescended on Monte Albán, it became the point of sacred ground. Therefore thefounding of Monte Albán. The name Monte Albán goes back to the Zapotec worddanibaan and means “sacred mountain.”image [images/img_173.jpg]Figure 173image [images/img_174.jpg]Figure 174Two thousand years ago, Monte Albán was already one of the largest cities ofMesoamerica with a population of 20,000.5 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn48] Asdiscoveries confirm, there were high-ranking contacts between Monte Albán andthe pyramid city of Teotihuacán. People exchanged ideas and goods—in the end,Teotihuacán was similarly a place of the gods like Monte Albán. The buildings onthe sacred mountain were enveloped in bright colors. At first, the buildingswere covered with a white stucco layer and then painted, and the stairways werecovered with a layer of red mortar. On forty large relief panels excavatorsfound strange figures engraved in stone. One can recognize naked men and beastsin partly twisted poses with crossed and open legs; then again with mutilatedgenitalia or spread thighs (figures 178 to 183). Previously, the representationswere called dancers, but today it is difficult to find a designation for them.And in the midst of them the image of an elephant, but that wouldn’t make sense(figures 184 and 185). There were no elephants in America, so no one would haverecognized the elephant in the relief of the devil—even if it is one. Out of thetrunk, birds with overhanging lips and peculiar parrots are conjured. Elephantsin America—impossible?image [images/img_175.jpg]Figure 175image [images/img_176.jpg]Figure 176image [images/img_177.jpg]Figure 177image [images/img_178.jpg]Figure 178And what if one of the “gods” took one of his students to Asia and brought himback? Laughable? At the very least, Indian legends give an account of this. Andin India the elephant god Ganesh is honored. In most Indian temples one can finda stone carved with Ganesh. They do not look very different from the pachydermon Monte Albán.Every day, the Voladores, the four mast-flying Indians, demonstrate their flightart on Monte Albán. Still today the godly game is regularly played on the ballfield of Monte Albán, where the players no longer have to use a heavy five-poundhard rubber ball as before.But I can’t stop thinking of that odd mythological being named Coqui Xee, whosupposedly slept in the hole of the grotto of “endless time.” Coqui Xee wasfinally the reason for the sanctuary on Monte Albán. This Coqui Xee should havestood outside the world, because thoughts could not touch him. He himselftraveled through the heavens. Hearing such legends, several cross-connectionsflash in my mind, though from completely different cultures. Exactly this makesthe tradition exciting. Why do people separated from one another know synonymousstories? Would you care for examples?image [images/img_179.jpg]Figure 179image [images/img_180.jpg]Figure 180image [images/img_181.jpg]Figure 181On the island of Raivavae in French Polynesia, the old temple Te Mahara stillstands as the point on which the god Maui landed after his flight in outerspace.6 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn49] The same applies to the ancientinhabitants of Atu Ona, a small island in the Marquesas. There the mountain KeiAn is considered a temple, although no building stands on the spot. The ancientPolynesians named it Mount Tautini-Etua, which literally translated means“mountain on which the gods landed.”7 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn50]Regarding the creator god Ta’aroa from the Society Islands of the Pacific:“Ta’arora sat in his shell in darkness since eternity. The shell was like an eggthat floats in endless space. There was no sky, no ocean, no moon, no sun, nostars. Everything was dark.”8 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn51]And in Samoa, it was reported about the original god Tagaloa: “God Tagaloa swamin the void, he created everything. Before him, there was no sky, no land, andhe was all alone and slept in the expanse of space. His name wasTagaloafa’atutupunu’u, which means ‘origin of growth.’”9[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn52]The creation myth of Kiribati (Micronesia, Pacific) begins with theestablishment long, long ago given by the god Nareau.10[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn53] No one knew where he came from, because Nareauflew alone and slept in space. In sleep, he heard his name be called threetimes, although the one who called his name was a “nobody.” Nareau awoke andlooked around. There was nothing but emptiness, but a large object was underhim. It was Te-Bomatemaki—which means “earth and heaven together.”In the east Colombian highlands the Cordillera lived as a tribe of Chibcha. TheSpanish historian Pedro Simon chronicled their creation legend: “It was night.But there were other things in the world. The light was locked in a large‘something house’ and came out of it. This ‘something house’ is ‘chiminigagua’and it contained the light in itself, that it might come out. In the light ofthe light, things began to be.”11 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn54]And the creation account in presumably the oldest book of humanity, the IndianRig Veda, puts us doubters again in the state of weightlessness and silence:There was neither non-being nor being then. There was neither the realm of spacenor the sky beyond. What stirred back and forth? What was the unfathomable?. . . There was neither death nor immortality then. There was no sign of day ornight. The One breathed according to its own law, without wind. Other than thatwas nothing there. . . . Was there a below? Was there an above? . . . Who knowsfor sure, who can proclaim it, whence they came, whence the creation?12[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn55]image [images/img_182.jpg]Figure 182image [images/img_183.jpg]Figure 183image [images/img_184.jpg]Figure 184I could draw out this play of comparisons much longer—and time and againfamiliar elements would appear. Coqui Xee, the real founder of the sanctuary onMonte Albán, slept “in a hole in the grotto of endless time.” He came from“outside of the world,” slept somewhere endlessly long, and “thoughts could notaffect him.” The synonymity with other myths is obvious.image [images/img_185.jpg]Figure 185In Costa Rica there is actually a puzzle that connects the inhabitants with the“balls in the sky.” In that Central American country there are around threehundred stone spheres made from gabbro, a granitelike plutonic rock. Onlyisolated spheres of shale or sandstone are extant. Most of the stone balls aresymmetrically circular, with diameters ranging from 10 centimeters (3.9 in.) to2.48 meters (8.1 ft.). People found and still find them in the Diquis Delta onthe Pacific side of Guatemala, but also in Rio Esquina National Park, on themountaintops, and today even in open places of Guatemala City (figures 186 to188). In Golfo Dulce fifteen of the giant balls lie in a perfectly straightline; north of the Sierra Brunquera, near the village of Uvita, twelve balls; inthe muddy bed of the Esquina River appeared four balls—no one knows how manyhave been washed away over the millennia. On Camaronal Island, people discoveredtwo of these balls, and more “sky balls”—as they were called—lie on the peaks ofCordillera Brunquera. How in the world did they get all the way up there?Guatemala was primeval forest. The balls could not easily roll around. Forrolling routes, people would have had to cut through the jungle. The same istrue for the forested mountain slopes, where even the strongest of arms wouldnot be enough to roll up the tons-heavy balls. Cables would have been essential.image [images/img_186.jpg]Figure 186image [images/img_187.jpg]Figure 187image [images/img_188.jpg]Figure 188As the United Fruit Company began to clear the virgin forest to create bananaplantations in the 1930s, the engineers repeatedly met with unnatural resistancein the ground. The old steam bulldozers of the time uncovered the stone spheres,and the workers pushed the unwanted things aside while shaking their heads. Thenthe aptly named Doris Stone, the daughter of an engineer, rode for weeks fromone find to the next and wrote the first report about the incomprehensiblespheres of Costa Rica. The first black-and-white photos are from her (figure189).13 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn56] Stone closed her work with the resignedobservation: “The balls of Costa Rica must be considered as one of the unsolvedmegalithic mysteries of the world.”image [images/img_189.jpg]Figure 189Today, we are no further along. We do not know who created the stone balls, wedo not know with which tools and geometric aids they worked, we do not know forwhat purpose the balls were created, nor when it happened. Everything that hasbeen suggested is completely speculative. A local legend suggests that the ballsrepresent the sun. But the sun was represented by the Indians as a golden disk,a rayed wheel, or even as a discus—not as a sphere. If it were so, the Indianswould have had their “sun balls” painted a golden color. There are no paintresidues. In contrast to the smaller ones, all the large balls are literallyspherical with smoothly polished surfaces. How did Stone Age people do that?Did the stonemasons first of all have the raw material—a stone block—that wasburied in the ground and then commence shaving it all around, which wouldinevitably create inaccuracy, since the distances to the parts of the stonestuck in the ground could no longer be controlled. But the raw materials musthave come from somewhere. There are no quarries in the places they were found.And why would the finished balls be transported to any old location, andsometimes to the height of a mountain? One theory holds that the balls weresimply rolled through the riverbeds. The riverbeds are muddy and pebbly. Theheavy stone balls sank. But the “riverbed theory” cannot explain balls on themountains.Experts believe that to produce a stone ball that weighs fifteen tons, the rawmaterials must have weighed at least twenty-four tons. In the face of threehundred balls, one can imagine the amount of raw material that must have beenmoved. In addition, there are multiple heavier balls on opposite sides of somerivers (figure 190). This means that there were considerable barriers tomaterial transport. Without flatbeds, without roads, without cranes, withoutcargo ships—and all in the jungle. In the Museo Popol Vuh in Guatemala City, Iasked an archaeologist about the significance of the balls. “Perhaps religiousor ritual background,” he said shrugging. “Possibly also some sky cult.”Cults, as far as the eye can see: on statues, temples, pyramids. Most of themhonor gods. Which gods?image [images/img_190.jpg]Figure 190image [images/img_191.jpg]Figure 191image [images/img_192.jpg]Figure 192"},{"pageContent":"4King Pakal’s AscensionLocated in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, Palenque has a unique role forany observers wearing cargo-cult specs. For the (by now) world-famous tombstoneis in Palenque: a 3.8-meter (12.5 ft.) long and 2.2-meter (7.2 ft.) widemonolith with various representations and Mayan characters. For experts, thereare no open questions about the representations on the slab. Everything followsa compulsory logic within Maya research. Lay people, however, recognize in thereliefs something extraterrestrial: misunderstood technologies.I wrote about the history of Palenque twenty-five years ago1[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn57] and must do it once more (again: willingly orreluctantly). Without some repetition I would leave new readers out in the cold.It was in 1773 in the town of Tumbala. A Spanish expeditionary force reported tothe curator of the district, Mr. Antonio de Solis, that some casas de piedras(stone houses) were located in the nearby jungle. Antonio de Solis, a priest,did not take the report as very important. Primitive Indian buildings wereeverywhere. The news about the casas de piedras also reached the priest RamonOrdoñez, who still hoped, maybe somewhere, to dig up a treasure. Ordoñez puttogether a small group that found the stone houses close to the village of SantoDomingo de Palenque and reported about pyramids, halls, and towers.This report reached the royal commission “Audiencia” in Guatemala, which in turnposted Colonel Antonio del Rio there to watch more closely the casas de piedras.With him went a draftsman who could record what lay in the jungle. From SantoDomingo de Palenque to the ruins were a laughable 6 kilometers (3.7 mi.). Butthe thickness of the jungle and the rainy season made the path through the greenhell an adventure. On May 3, 1787, Colonel Antonio del Rio reached the casas depiedras with his squad. And with that began the discovery of Palenque.Colonel del Rio needed two weeks to thin out the brush around the buildings andcut through the foliage. Then he “stood in the middle of a clearing and staredspellbound at the ruins of a palace, a true maze of rooms and courtyards, highon a giant platform made of earth and rubble”2 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn58](figures 191 [9781591432364_c03.xhtml#fig191] and 192[9781591432364_c03.xhtml#fig192]). The walls were covered with unintelligiblesigns and mysterious figures, and rainwater dripped from countless gutters.Swarms of bloodthirsty mosquitos bit the men through their shirts. Colonel delRio wanted to get his sweat-soaked assignment behind him as quickly as possibleand had the floors ripped up and walls torn down. His actions still astoundarchaeologists to this day.Nonetheless, del Rio brought thirty-two objects and twenty-five drawings toSanto Domingo de Palenque, which were passed on to the Audiencia. The dossiertraveled at some point to Madrid, and there all crates with their drawingsdisappeared into an insatiable archive. The heap of rubble in New Spain, as theconquered regions were known back home, did not interest anyone in the royalcourt.But sometimes chance rules. Forty-five years later, del Rio’s reportinexplicably landed in the hands of London bookseller Henry Berthoud. He likedwhat he saw and in 1822 published a small booklet with some drawings fromdel Rio’s report. This booklet in turn fascinated an amiable and colorfulcharacter: the Count Johann Friedrich von Waldeck. It is not documented wherethis Count Waldeck came from. He himself offered various curricula vitae to theworld. He sometimes gave his birthplace as Paris, once as Prague, once asVienna. Whoever he was, Waldeck was an outstanding draftsman. And he made up hismind to travel to Palenque.In March of 1822 Waldeck set off from London. He left his family behind. Beforeleaving he had a fund-raising campaign for his expedition to Palenque thatbarely brought in anything. The word Palenque meant nothing to anyone. In MexicoWaldeck actually managed to receive official approval to carry out research inPalenque. So he invited the Indians of Santo Domingo de Palenque to help him inthe name of the Mexican government to excavate the ruins. But the Indians wantedto see money—they didn’t care about any far-off government. Waldeck’s entirebelongings consisted of 3,000 Mexican dollars that melted away like butter inthe blazing sun. Completely broke, he still continued on. Often left alone,tormented by the tropical environment, he made his way to the overgrown temples,sat day after day, drawing board on his knees, in the sultry heat and capturedPalenque in more than 100 drawings. In order to escape the diluvian cloudburstsand the furiously biting insects, Count Waldeck set up a modest camp in a ruinthat he separated from the outdoors with a curtain. Today, the building isaffectionately and mockingly called the Temple of the Count.Waldeck’s enthusiasm never waned. In specific reliefs he thought he discoveredelephant heads, and he believed that Palenque must have been reached by peoplefrom Africa or Asia. Today’s experts see Waldeck’s elephants as “masks of raingods.” Waldeck raged when locals dared to break the plaster panels from thewalls in order to sell them. He jealously observed foreign visitors, because hehated when others sketched “his” building. Bitter and destitute, Waldecktraveled to Campeche in the spring of 1834. There he hoped to sell his drawingsfor a hefty price. But in the meantime the government in Mexico City wasreplaced, and Waldeck did not trust the new rulers. So he had all his drawingscopied in pencil. He trusted the originals to a British official who broughtthem to London. Suddenly, the Mexican newspapers accused Count Waldeck of livingas a vandal in Palenque and secretly taking away treasures. None of this wastrue. A delegation of the mayor had Waldeck’s baggage searched and confiscatedhis drawings. They were the copies.Angry and disappointed, Waldeck left Mexico and moved with his family to theirquarters in Paris. In 1838 he published the memories of his romanticarchaeological journey in Yucatán with a selection of twenty-one drawings thatwere his favorites. And so began another round for Palenque.In New York at that time lived the lawyer John Lloyd Stephens, who had a passionfor traveling. The jurist had visited different countries in Europe, and alsoTurkey, Palestine, and Egypt. To his acquaintances back home, Stephens senthumorously perceptive and spicy letters—without knowing that one of his Americanfriends would publish these letters. And so the lawyer Stephens, without hisconsent, became the travel writer Stephens. In London he visited the exhibition“Panorama Jerusalem” with a series of pictures by the well-known painterFrederick Catherwood. Stephens sought to make contact with Catherwood, whosework deeply touched him. They met in a London tearoom. Catherwood was alsowell-traveled and possessed entire maps full of interesting drawings with templemotifs from the Mediterranean. Their shared wanderlust and adventures in farcontinents made them friends. Where should they go?Just at that time the booklet with Count Waldeck’s drawings was circulating inLondon. Stephens and Catherwood at first doubted whether the forests of Mexicoactually had such remarkable ruins. And if so, they could never come from theIndians or their ancestors. The new friends were determined to travel to CentralAmerica and get to the bottom of things. At first Stephens returned to New Yorkand became active as a lawyer. He applied for the post of diplomaticrepresentative of the United States at the head office of Latin Americancountries in Guatemala. Luckily, relationships and his degree of notoriety astravel writer worked in his favor. Stephens became the diplomat, and receivedhis desired passport and a pile of letters of recommendation. With those it waspossible for him to charge the state with part of his travel costs. He then metFrederick Catherwood in New York. Stephens gave him a contract as the expeditionartist and secured continuous maintenance payments for the Catherwood family. OnOctober 3, 1839, the friends set off. Destination: the controversial ruins of anunknown culture of Central America.There were two long, adventurous journeys in which Stephens and Catherwoodvisited, described, and drew forty-four ruined cities. In 1841 and 1843,Stephens published his reports, which hit the wider scientific world like abomb.3 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn59]The tourists that drive to the superbly restored ruins in an air-conditioned busknow nothing of the tribulations Stephens and Catherwood endured some 170 yearsbefore. The rainy season had just begun as the friends, accompanied by someinhabitants from the nearby village of Santo Domingo de Palenque, reached theruins. The jungle dripped and steamed. The casas de piedras were twisted underthe dense jungle and mosses, and so they did not find them at first. Just likeCount Waldeck, they had no choice but to establish quarters in the first ruinthey found. After the mosquitos turned their first night into hell under aruined roof, all of their possessions got wet; in the humidity of the continuousrain their shoes, clothes, and the leather gear began to mildew, iron devicessuch as spades and blades began to rust. Always full of humor, Stephens noted:“We considered ourselves already securely booked for rheumatism.”Stephens paid his workers eighteen cents per day, but they were lazy, came toolate, and left early: “Sometimes only two or three showed up, and the sameIndian rarely came a second time, so that during our stay, all the Indians of avillage rotated through us.” The mosquitos, “those murderers of rest,” joinedalong with poisonous snakes, ticks, and other parasites. The nights weredreadful. They could not light any candles, because the light would bring thepests by the thousands. Only the smoke of cigars kept the critters at adistance.After they finally fought through the brush and lianas to a pyramid, theydiscovered broken stones or walls: the work of Colonel del Rio. Stephensdiscovered more locations where reliefs were obviously removed by profiteers tobe sold. Then they stood overwhelmed in front of the walls from which grim facespeered. Proud sad-looking statues commanded respect: “We were fixed with wonderby their expressions of serene composure and their strong similarity to Egyptianstatues.” Despite the recollection of Egypt, Stephens was aware of theuniqueness of the culture of the people that had built Palenque: “What we sawwas marvelous, puzzling, and very remarkable.” He wrote that nothing “in worldhistory books impressed him as much as this spectacular, large, and lovelycity.” Wrapped in humorous conversational style, Stephens delivered proof of hisexpertise and his brilliant powers of observation. Catherwood’s illustrationscompleted the work with precise representations of the buildings and sculptures.Catherwood was “the first illustrator who accepted Mayan art in its own style.”4[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn60] Even today, Catherwood’s images are irreplaceablebecause the level of detail worked out in his fine strokes cannot be achievedwith photography. In addition, the images show things that disappeared long ago.Stephens and Catherwood deserve the credit for “having opened the era ofscientific Maya research.”5 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn61]In their time Stephensand Catherwood could only guess and speculate. The Mayan writing was not yetdeciphered, and the Mayan calendar was not yet known. A Popul Vuh—the “bible” ofthe Quiché Maya—was not yet read by anyone, not to mention the Chilam Balambooks or the old Mexican manuscripts. But at the time, it was clear to bothresearchers that it was a matter of religion and of gods—but the meanings ofthem, the resulting confusion, first began 120 years later.The origin of Palenque is still not known today. The word Palenque comes fromthe Spaniards who used it to describe the wooden enclosures and the dwellings ofthe Indians. The history of the Maya, however, can be read in many temples,especially the Temple of the Inscriptions. According to that, on March 11,431 CE, a thirty-four-year-old monarch named Bahlum Kuk ascended the throne.This was followed by a dynasty of ten generations, in which the boy Pakaloccupied a critical role. This Pakal inherited the throne from his mother, andthe accession was imposed upon him when he was barely twelve years old. He ruledsixty-eight years and was finally buried in the famous pyramid named the Templeof the Inscriptions. More on that later.No building in Palenque is in its location by chance; everything has to do withastronomy and the cosmos. In addition to the “Palace,” the group of “Temples ofthe Cross”—actually smaller pyramids—is predominant, where each temple standsfor a heavenly ruler (figures 193 and 194). Since the German Maya researcherHeinrich Berlin did not understand the gods of these temples, he labeled themwith numbers: God I, God II, and God III.6 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn62] Thatis what they are still called today (figures 195 and 196). From the inscriptionson the Temple of the Cross, we know the birth date of God I: October 21, 2360BCE.image [images/img_193.jpg]Figure 193image [images/img_194.jpg]Figure 194image [images/img_195.jpg]Figure 195image [images/img_196.jpg]Figure 196image [images/img_197.jpg]Figure 197image [images/img_198.jpg]Figure 198As in Egypt and India, naturally God I was originally “descended from heaven.”7[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn63] God II (with the name K’awii) shows up in theTemple of the Foliated Cross. He was the youngest of the three divinities. Yethis birthday is millennia in the past: born on November 8, 2360 BCE. God III isthe sun god, and his temple is the sun temple. He was born—according to theinscriptions—on October 25, 2360, so in the same year as God I and God II. Allthree buildings of the Cross Temple Group represent in their arrangement thecosmology and royal power.At present, the most prominent Mayan writing experts are father and son Davidand George Stuart (University of Texas, Austin). Both were critically involvedin deciphering Mayan writing and are undisputed top experts of the field. Theybelieve that the general theme of the Temple of Palenque is the rebirth of thegods in heaven. “We see that the three temples together symbolize the bases ofthe cosmos: the heaven, the water surface, and the underworld. It is noaccident: the Temple of the Cross is the highest, the Temple of the Sun is thelowest, and the Temple of the Foliated Cross symbolizes the middle”8[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn64] (figure 197, 198 and 199).image [images/img_199.jpg]Figure 199Did the three gods create the universe? Were they something like the HolyTrinity of the Christian religion (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)? No, there wereancestors to these gods that, logically, must have been older than Gods I, II,and III. In the inaugural panel of the Temple of the Cross, a goddess appearsfrom the year 3121 BCE, and in Temple XIX, we learn that God I assumed his royaloffice in 3309 BCE. King of what? Of Palenque? No. The inscription in Temple XIXclearly shows that it deals with a reign “in heaven.” At some point, people musthave argued about the notion of “heaven.”With the confusing data from the world of the Maya gods comes the question: Isall this real? Was this truly meant? Where do the exact dates of birth comefrom: Are they inventions or wishful thinking by the Maya priests? Were sometype of beings actually born in heaven on those named dates? Or was there beforePalenque, as some archaeologists are investigating, already another “Palenque,”another much older city, and do the dates of birth refer to this unknown place?No archaeological evidence has been discovered that would justify there being aPalenque before Palenque. Or—asked speculatively—is the data concerning variousgods providing true data that can be understood only in connection with spacetravel? (Meanwhile, it has long been proved that for astronauts in a very fastspaceship, time passes differently than for the inhabitants of the startingplanet.)As a vagabond between cultures it is my job to draw the attention of the expertson the Maya to the fact that preposterous dates are passed down in areas of theworld completely different from Central America. From Babylonia comes a 20.5centimeter (8 in.) high stone block, called WB 444 (located today in the BritishMuseum), on which the reigning years of the oldest kings before the Flood werelisted. As the kingdom descended from heavenWas the kingdom in Eridu.In Eridu was Alulim kingHe ruled 28,800 years . . .Illta-sadumRuled 1,200 yearsMes-kiag-ga (ser)Son of the sun god1,324 yearsHe ruledThe divine Lugal-banda1,200 yearsHe ruled . . .And it continues, one and a half pages long. And exactly these “crazy” dateswere given by the ancient historian Diodorus. He wrote: “At first, gods andheroes ruled Egypt for a little less than 18,000 years. And the last divine kingwas Horus, son of Isis. But the land was ruled by human kings from Moeris for noless than 5,000 years, to the 180th Olympiad, which is when I myself traveled toEgypt.”9 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn65]Manetho, another historian who was active in Egypt centuries ago, claimed:“After the gods, the lineage of divine offspring ruled for 1,255 years. And inturn, other kings ruled for 1,817 years. Then came thirty kings, Memphites,ruling for 1,790 years . . . and then the kingdom of divine offspring for 5,813years.”10 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn66]And this goes on, whether in Egypt, Babylon, India, Tibet, or even in the OldTestament. Adam is supposed to have been 930 years old, Seth 912 years old,Methuselah 969 years old, and so on. I am not baffled by these dates of theMaya. As in the creation myths, there is a reality hidden behind the impossiblenumbers. Our present problem is the specialization of certain disciplines. Mayascholars mostly do not know anything about the date of “WB 444” or those ofDiodorus. We all live only one life and it is too short to be specialists inmultiple fields.image [images/img_200.jpg]Figure 200The third table of the Temple of Inscriptions of Palenque even turns up a datethat is connected with the “boy king Pakal,” which is 1,247,654 years in thepast. On top of that: The Mayan writing experts David and George Stuart drawattention to the fact that in Palenque, future dates were projected: “Pakal’sevident ‘timelessness’ was highlighted on a table by his renewed resurrection(appearance) 4,000 years in the future.”11 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn67]The dates are there, carved into stone. And while we have to put everything inorder, we bundle our thoughts according to the logic of the zeitgeist. Whatelse? Will future generations possibly laugh about our logic?Deep in the ground under the pyramid that is called the Temple of Inscriptionslies the grave of the ruler K’inich Janaab Pakal. He was the greatest ruler ofPalenque and his building is another story (figure 200). It lies in thesouthwest corner of the so-called Palace and sits atop a 16-meter (52.5 ft.)tall pyramid made of nine plinths piled on top of one another. In 1949 theMexican archaeologist Dr. Alberto Ruz Lhuillier worked as the chief excavator inPalenque. He was most interested in the Temple of Inscriptions, because hispredecessors barely dug there. One day he noticed a rectangle on the floor ofthe upper platform, where the inscriptions were stuck to the walls. Byuncovering a panel, the edge of a stairway step became visible. Obviously, thestairway led into the inner pyramid, although it was stuffed with stones andmud. The work was torture. The deeper the diggers penetrated, the more compactthe mud was and therefore the heavier the rocks. Stone after stone was hoistedup by the men, every bucket with mud was individually carried out. Twenty-threesteps were finally freed. Alberto Ruz was convinced that the work would end inthe coming year and the secrets of the pyramid would be revealed.In the next excavating season, twenty-one additional steps were freed from thedreck. But who hid something there and intentionally filled it back in millenniaago (figure 201)? Finally, at the forty-fifth step within the pyramid, theground became flat and made a U-turn. But then the stairway continued in theeastern direction. A year later, the men burrowed deeper. Then a rectangularhole appeared in a wall, and the diggers could literally breathe. The openingturned out to be a ventilation shaft that ran through an 8-meter (26 ft.) thickwall on the western side of the pyramid.image [images/img_201.jpg]Figure 201image [images/img_202.jpg]Figure 202image [images/img_203.jpg]Figure 203In 1952 a new obstacle of stone and mortar prevented all progress. Thesweat-dripping Sisyphean task in the damp, hot pyramid would not end. After somesteps the diggers stood before a 4-meter (13 ft.) thick wall. There they foundthe bones of a sacrificed youth. On June 15, 1952, Dr. Ruz stood with his teambefore a triangular door (figures 202 and 203). With a chisel, it was nudged ahandsbreadth to the side. Dr. Ruz held a flashlight through the opening andpressed his face to the moist slab. Breathless, he described to his team what hesaw: “At first I noticed a large, empty room, a type of ice cave, whose wallsand ceiling seemed to me to be perfect surfaces, like an abandoned chapel, fromwhose ceiling entire curtains of stalactites hung. As if they were thick,dripping candles.”12 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn68]The walls, on which colorful reliefs with figures were stuck, glistened likesnow crystals. The floor of the crypt was covered by a single almost 4-meter (13ft.) long slab that was entirely covered with glyphs. As the triangular door wasopened enough to let the men through, the stalactites (dripstones) were knockedfrom the ceiling out of impatience and curiosity in the excitement of themoment. What a shame! If only a single stalactite remained, just how old thissubterranean room was could have been calculated. Dripstones get bigger yearafter year by some millimeters or centimeters, depending on whether the water isdripping through lime or granite layers. The crypt under the pyramid is 9 meters(29.5 ft.) long, 4 meters (13 ft.) wide, and 7 meters (23 ft.) tall. It wouldhave rained over Palenque for centuries, millennia, and water penetrated throughthe masonry. As long as the temple city was active, the Maya maintained theirsanctuaries, and cracks in the buildings were patched with mortar. In addition,the buildings glowed in bright colors. Just a little water trickled though thecracks into the subterranean room. Only when Palenque was uninhabited didfissures form in the pyramid’s outer layer, and plant seeds could settle inthese gaps and break the stones.image [images/img_204.jpg]Figure 204image [images/img_205.jpg]Figure 205The discovered room lay 2 meters (6.6 ft.) under the base of the Temple ofInscriptions (= pyramid). The hieroglyphic plate on the floor proved to be asingle monolith, 3.8 meters (12.5 ft.) long and 2.2 meters (7.2 ft.) wide, 25centimeters (9.8 in.) thick and weighing around 8 tons (figure 204). Under theslab is a sarcophagus (figure 205). It was quickly clear that this “tombstone,”as it is called today, could never have been transported through the narrowstaircase to the inside of the pyramid. The room with the slab existed beforethe pyramid: first came the subterranean crypt and later the building above.Since the discovery by Alberto Ruz Lhuillier, sixty years have passed, in whichdifferent meanings have been given to the remarkable relief on the slab (I firstshow the image in horizontal, figure 206, and later in vertical format, figure209). The discoverer, Alberto Ruz, believed it was aboutimage [images/img_206.jpg]Figure 206a young man, retreating behind a large mask of the earth monster. . . . Over hisbody stands a cross, identical with the famous cross of another temple inPalenque. Out of a double-headed snake spring small mythological shapes, on topa Quetzal bird with the mask of the rain god. We can accept that the scenerepresents fundamental concepts of the Mayan religion.13[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn69]The American Herbert Wilhelmy recognized in the central figure the corn god YumKox.14 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn70] Pierre Ivanoff disagreed:The symbolic meaning of this curious representation poses some puzzles. The godof death, with his connection to the underworld, is, according the beliefs ofthe Maya, also the same god of the fertile earth. The man above him with hisleaping posture resembles emerging life. His face is reminiscent of that of thecorn god, and for that reason he could be the incarnation of germinating nature.Authority and power were carried together with the ceremonial staff of thequartered universe, the cross, that is simultaneously an image of the world,time, and change of power. Lastly the bird Moan symbolizes death.15[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn71]The Prague professor Miloslav Stingl wore another pair of glasses:One recognizes the figure of a young man, although obviously not an actualperson, but a person—simply, the human race—is represented. A cross grows out ofhis body, which symbolizes the life-giving corn. Out of the corn leaves,entwined on both sides, double-headed snakes appear. . . . The body of the youththus outgrows life, but itself rests on the face of death—the repulsive head ofa fantastic animal, out of whose mouth protrude pointed tusks.16[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn72]The renowned Maya archaeologist Dr. Linda Schele sees thatIn his burial chamber located deep below the cave temple in the heart of thepyramid, Pakal has recorded the deaths of the kings named in the temple hallabove. In addition, he has them appear figuratively on the sidewalls of hissarcophagus as an orchard of ancestors emerging from crevices in the earth.17[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn73]In the course of the years—as is the case with a living science—new suggestionswere voiced. They ranged from “earth monsters” to the “stylized whiskers of theweather god,” from a “living cross” to a “broken rat’s tail.” Everyonediscovered something different on the tombstone. Markus Eberl, one of the mostrecognized Maya specialists in recent times had this to say about therepresentation on the slab:In some way, the inscription on the lid of K’inich Janaab Pakal’s sarcophagusrecounts what he should expect at death: following the call of his predecessorsand ancestors, he entered the path to the underworld that his predecessors hadalready traveled. . . . The sarcophagus lid records a crucial moment on thejourney to the afterlife. . . . The ruler rises from the skeletal jaws of theunderworld in the form of the young corn god . . . and out of him grows across-forming world tree, that marks the way of the dead in the next world.18[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn74]In another work, Dr. Linda Schele refined her view of the tombstone:The image on the sarcophagus lid shows Pakal’s death and his travel to theunderworld. The entire scene is framed through the band of sky with Kin (“day”or “sun”) in the corner top right and with Abkal (“night” or “darkness”) on theleft. The cosmic event, which shows Pakal’s journey in death, is the movement ofthe sun from east to west.19 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn75]It goes on like this for decades. Opinions, monsters, misunderstandings. Wouldyou care for another expert opinion?The scene on the slab is very similar to the representation on the Cross andFoliated Cross Temples. But this time, one person balances dangerously on thegrotesque head of the earth monster. From the body of the man grows a cross-liketree, whose branches end in snake heads. Like in other Palenque sculptures, awonderfully stylized bird overlooks the scene from its seat in the tree.20[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn76]The story of the interpretation remains alive. Thank God, I would like to add,because the Maya specialists are finally understanding more and more of the oldglyphs. The absolute tops among Mayan epigraphers (deciphering) are David andGeorge Stuart. In the inscription, they read the story of the boy king Pakal upuntil his death. “The inscription ends with a record of death from Pakal’s wifeIx Tz’akbu Ajaw in year 672, followed by the date of death of Pakal himself in683.”21 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn77]But the duo Stuart and Stuart also noted:Considered in its entirety, the sarcophagus can be viewed as a carefully puttogether model of the cosmos. . . . In the center of the symbols, one sees thereclining human figure of K’inich Janaab Pakal, surrounded by a complexcosmological presentation. The band of sky frames the entire scene and alludesto the things in heaven.What earlier interpretations of the panel also saw as a “quetzal bird,” Stuartand Stuart argue is a “supernatural bird.” And if one agreed with the currentopinion that King Pakal crashed into an earth monster, the actual doctrine seesit differently: King Pakal climbed out of the earth.This new meaning is clearly shown through the sun bowl, which is sometimes usedin hieroglyphic texts with the sign “el” which means “ascend,” “climb,” orsometimes also “burn” and mostly in the word “el-l’in” (“east,” “rising sun”).It is therefore reasonable that Pakal’s position in the sun bowl is explicitlyin the eastern direction, which means Pakal ascends and he emerges from theearth with the sunrise (emphasis added).22 [9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn78]And what is it with the ominous “tree of life” or “cross of life” that lies onPakal’s chest? Stuart and Stuart see in that an “abstract tree” that is oftendescribed by experts as a “world tree” because of its cross-like form, althoughthis does not mean anything sensible. “For the Maya, trees always had a verycomplex and important cosmological meaning.”image [images/img_207.jpg]Figure 207Critical in the newest interpretation of the tombstone of Palenque is theconclusion that Pakal did not go to any underworld, but rather went toward theheavens.Exactly this has been my concern for the past fifty years. Understandably, the“cross of life” or “tree of life” does not represent any kind of rocket (figure207): but it is about something misunderstood from the cargo school. If even theexperts can begin with such vague concepts as “tree of life” and “cross oflife,” might other viewpoints also be possible? Linda Schele identifies the“world tree with heavenly birds” and a “Kan cross water-lily monster.”23[9781591432364_nts.xhtml#fn79] The panel also contains a “band of sky” (Schele),and both ribbed curves on the right and left growing out of the “tree of life”are “snub-nosed dragons” (Schele). Elsewhere, I also read that it depicts brokenrats’ tails. Now, the Maya archaeologists and epigraphers have certainly doneoutstanding work. Oddballs or followers of any conspiracy theories are notincluded. They try to be honest and explain with much expertise that which isdifficult to understand. Yet ultimately, all thought is subject to reason. Andthis changes from generation to generation.image [images/img_208.jpg]Figure 208The fact remains that King Pakal is represented in a unique posture. He sitsforward inclined to the east, toward the rising sun—and this according to thelatest reading, so as not to fall between the canines of an “earth monster.” Heflies away from the earth (figure 208). Two fingers of his upper hand aretogether, as if they were making a fine adjustment. On his lower hand, one canrecognize the four bent fingers of the back of the hand. They turn something.With that, the professional opinion of father and son Stuart is that the panelcan be “considered in its entirety . . . as a carefully put together model ofthe cosmos.”In cargo-cult thinking, no perfect technological representations exist becausethe forefathers, who saw something technological, could not make heads or tailsof it. They did not have a clue about what they saw, not to mention theirdescendants centuries or millennia later. Then divine articles were handed down,which had some amazing effects: they could fly, shoot, make light, causetremors, and obviously also lift up selected people. For people of the StoneAge, a car with headlights and radiator was viewed with bright eyes and gapingmouth. These encounters with foreign objects migrate indelibly into the brainsof the people. Too impressive, too formidable, too foreign, too “divine,” toopowerful were the confrontations of the people of the day with such foreigntechnology to ever be erased from their memories. All the more so since thepriests continuously drummed the unexplainable into their people, and theartists translated the same into stuccoworks, statues, and temples. Somethinglike this survives ineradicably from generation to generation. Today’s livingreligions demonstrate this. Despite history books and Gospels, we do not knowwhat actually happened during Jesus’s time. But we also believe after twothousand years in the nonsense of immaculate conception, ascending to heaven,raising from the dead, and so on. It was not very different millennia before.Our technologically clueless Stone Age people did not realize this—but itimpressed them enormously. Logically, their descendants understood evenless—although the gods, together with their objects, were further revered. Themystery remains a mystery. Everything divine is mysterious. This is called cargocult. With this premise in the back of my mind, I recognize many misunderstoodcult objects in Maya Land, including the tombstone of Palenque. Whereby it doesnot matter in the cargo view whether the image is viewed horizontally orvertically (figure 209).image [images/img_209.jpg]Figure 209We devoutly accept words from the Maya world that happen to sound scientific butare nonetheless detached from reality. What do the following phrases mean:double-headed snake bands, quartered sun monsters, jaws of the underworld, worldtree, square dragon nose, supernatural bird, Kan-cross soul monster, snub-noseddragons, and so on—all referring to the tombstone? A swelling of ideas that onlymake sense in a very specific model, and only then with a portion of devoutfaith. The argument for the “snub-nosed dragons” emerged in other Maya temples,as did the “quartered monster” or “supernatural bird,” and therefore the currentview is compelling, and does not offend. Why? Because the interpretations wentin the wrong direction from the beginning. The reading of a glyph must not bethe meaning of the glyph. A “light year” is not the electricity bill for a year.Pakal, the buried king of Palenque, was not a legitimate heir to the throne.Therefore—according to the doctrinal view—his family invented a story in orderto present him as a heavenly ruler to the people. So Pakal became thereincarnation of earlier gods. His son Chan-Bahlum solidified this claim. Hedeified his father and described the creation of earth on his pyramid.Necessarily, the father Pakal as a descendant of the gods had an important roleto play. Since this view is so and cannot be read from the glyphs of Palenque,no other conclusions can be drawn from it. I would like to bring up a modestobjection: Why did other cultures (Tibet, Egypt, India, Babylon, and so on) fromthe same crazy time as the Maya pass on traditions of “sons of gods”? Did theroyal dynasties of our predecessors worldwide suffer the same flight of fancy?Or was there somewhere in the global pantheon of all gods a common ground thathas escaped us?All temples of the Buddhist culture know the stupa form. Whether in India,Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, and elsewhere, stupas are ubiquitous. ForWesterners a stupa looks like a bell with a handle (figure 210). In Buddhism astupa has different meanings, one of which is that it is a small vehicle to thelarger world of the gods. Stupas are therefore not empty (figure 211). The youngBuddha sits inside and performs ritual movements with his hands, which connecthis small vehicle with the larger heavenly vehicle of the gods. Nothingdifferent from Pakal in his “cosmic setting” on the other side of the globe. Howabout a new science? Central American Indology.image [images/img_210.jpg]Figure 210image [images/img_211.jpg]Figure 211Could it possibly be that some things in this wide world are much more connectedand even simpler when we smart-alecks think together?"},{"pageContent":"EndnotesPROLOGUE.
